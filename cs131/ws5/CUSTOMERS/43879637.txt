While we tend to assume corporate managers are all savvy, in fact many are surprisingly naive and we all can stand to learn more.<br /><br />Secret Handshake is not as strong as Reardon's first book, They Don't Get It, Do They. The first book included novel and original ideas about a subject the author obviously cares about. But it's worth a quick read - not much more.<br /><br />Reardon begins by categorizing both companies and employees in terms of their political styles. I'm always suspicious of profiles, but her ad hoc approach offers a face-saving way for people to say, \\"Hey, I'm just not political.\\"<br /><br /> Overall this book includes useful perspectives, although some readers will not be impressed by the common sense reminders. Most corporate employees can figure out that one-upping the boss is bad timing. But some ideas (like he PURRR technique) will save some careers. The section on getting heavy-handed will be especially valuable.<br /><br />And some will disagree with Reardon's interpretation of a situation. For instance, a young woman visits a recruiting booth while the company recruiter talks to Reardon. She politely excuses herself for interrupting and insists on leaving her resume. The young woman was interested in a sales job; in my opinion, her persistence should have been applauded!<br /><br />I read this book after hearing Barbara Ehrenreich speak on her latest book, Bait and Switch. What a contrast! Ehrenreich questions everything that Reardon takes for granted. Reardon warns against \\"showing up the boss (p 59), while Ehrenreich would point out that stifling disagreement wouldn't be in the best interests of the company in the long run. Reardon accepts corporate values -- or at least implies, \\"Hey -- that's the way it is.\\" I can just see Ehrenreich rolling her eyes and raising her eyebrows.<br /><br />There are a couple of minor bloopers on pages 66-67. On page 67 is a reference to Daphne Merion - I think she means Daphne Merkin, a rather outspoken writer for the New Yorker.<br /><br />And I question Reardon's version of the story behind Madeline Albright's nomination as Secretary of State. Reardon seems to suggest that Albright got the job in part because of her connections to Clinton. But other sources suggest that Clinton actually resisted naming Albright until he was pressured by female legislators. And in fact, some have questioned whether others were equally qualified.<br /><br /> But perhaps the biggest criticism of this book is that, although insights are valuable, it's..well, dull! We need more war stories and more anecdotes. The material has the potential to be as gripping as a novel -- and Reardon's first book (They Don't Get It Do They) managed to come across as much more reasonable.bloopers on pages 66-67.

Ehrenreich may be a cool, hard-headed, experienced journalist. Yet in researching Bait and Switch, she managed to capture the realities of the typical midlife career-changer - someone who hasn't been on a job search in twenty years, maybe ever.<br /><br />People thrust into a new world, out of their comfort zone, have no idea where to go for help. Many of my clients have done just what Ehrenreich did - and to some extent what I did, too, when I left academia for self-employment.  They hire consultants and coaches who are easiest to find. They ask the wrong questions.  They sign up for job fairs, \\"boot camps,\\" online resume posting and testing services.<br /><br />To be fair, many people want fast, easy answers.  When I tell prospective clients why I do not offer assessments, some - including professionals with advanced degrees - decide to go elsewhere.  Many opt for the \\"resume blasting\\" services that are notoriously ineffective.  And it's hard for anyone to resist promises to \\"take you to the next level\\" or \\"triple your business.\\"<br /><br />One mistake leads to another, as Ehrenreich demonstrates: her off-the-wall Enneagram coach referred her to a resume writer who seems inept and unethical.  Most ethical career coaches charge a flat fee for resume writing; they don't draw out the process.<br /><br />The key to Ehrenreich's book comes on page 216: \\"If there were other entirely different tacks to take, none of the job seekers I met seemed to know of them.\\"<br /><br />There are other \\"tacks,\\" which can be found by careful research or just plain luck.  For example: Advised to network with PRSA (Public Relations Society of America), Ehrenreich gave up because the job change group was disbanded. But why not attend lunch meetings at PRSA, Women in Communications, American Marketing Association? Why not try college alumni and placement offices? Talk to recruiters?<br /><br />A competent, experienced career consultant would have told Ehrenreich at the outset, \\"Your goal is challenging: a job with benefits in a competitive field. Employers like to see corporate experience. And you're not based in a large city: a national search presents unique challenges.  We can try but you need to consider some alternatives. \\"<br /><br />Real clients often resist this message. They continue searching till they end up with someone like \\"Kimberly.\\"<br /><br />Ehrenreich complains that career coaches are \\"unlicensed and unregulated.\\"  But career counselors in many states are licensed and regulated.  Many have studied in accredited academic programs where they learn to administer tests like Myers-Briggs, which Ehrenreich (rightly, I believe) deplores.  They learn counseling techniques but I don't think anyone can be licensed based on an understanding of \\"how the world of work really works.\\"<br /><br />Ultimately, Ehrenreich comes across as rather distant from her project.  She read \\"a dozen or more\\" career books - but hundreds are available. I'd start with the Complete Idiot's Guide to Writing a Resume.  And I can't help wondering if prospective employers would get that \\"something is not right here\\" feeling from her patchwork resume and story.<br /><br />Perhaps some subjects cannot be researched by undercover journalists.  I can't help wishing Ehrenreich had interviewed a wide range of career consultants, coaches, employers and job applicants. The real question should be, \\"Why do some people negotiate a successful career change (even when they're over 50) and others do not? Which resources really help and which drain your bank account (and may actually harm your career)?\\"<br /><br />In the end, Bait and Switch book deserves attention because it raises questions we should all be discussing.

Although I do not have personal need of the book (my parents are dead), many of my contemporaries are or were caregivers.  This book helped me understand them.  Among my aquaintances, nearly every primary caregiver is on antidepressants. With little time for exercise or self-care they have health and weight problems.  And the primary caregiver often is not the favorite child. As Pipher says, he or she may be an estranged child seeking a last chance to work out \\"unresolved issues,\\" in the language of therapy.<br /><br />The book's title can be misleading. Satow does not limit her topic to children who resent their parents. She provides several examples of selfless caregivers who love their parents and care for them willingly. Often they're repaying an emotional debt or following a culture they embrace.<br /><br />Given the heavy subject matter, author Satow couldn't take on the usual upbeat, cheery tone of most self-help books.  In fact, reading the book can be exhausting.  I am reminded of Mary Pipher's book, Another Country: relentless examples of frustration with no end in sight.<br /><br />Compared to Pipher, Satow comes across more as a hands-on therapist and teacher.  And she's the kind of therapist who holds firm to mainstream beliefs  (e.g., we never lose ties to our parents) and offers, by way of encouragement, a simple, \\"That's difficult.\\"<br /><br />Like Pipher, Satow's message is one of acceptance. At some point in life, there's little to anticipate.  And contemporary American society lacks an infrastructure to provide support.<br /><br />The book would be stronger if the author had stepped back for a broader perspective. Many caregivers sacrificed their own lives, so who will care for them as they age? How will the single or childless elderly fend for themselves?<br /><br />And some relationships seem so broken or distant that one or more children could move to the opposite end of the world, guilt-free.  Remember the Sopranos episode where Tony's mother dies? Carmela, Tony's wife, says, \\"Who are we kidding? She was awful.\\" A funeral director told me he's experienced this reaction first-hand - more than once.<br /><br />The biggest omission in Satow's book relates to money.  In her last chapter, Satow makes some recommendations for caregivers. She includes a list of questions, encouraging caregivers to assess whether they're experiencing illness, taking out their frustrations on their own children or giving up a social life altogether.<br /><br />But Satow totally ignores the financial effects of caregiving.  When the parent dies, the child who gave up career options now has to move forward, battling age discrimination and a  resume gap.  Sometimes parents never get around to updating a will. Some die intestate.  The inheritance gets divided evenly among three, four or five children, who rarely are motivated to reward the primary caregiver.  And the primary caregiver's career can suffer or even disappear.<br /><br />Still, I'd recommend this book to anyone who's caring for an elderly parent. But I suspect caregivers have little time to read.  Ultimately, this book will help the rest of us try to understand a little more.or more children could move to the opposite end of the world, guilt-free.

Why do some survive and become great while others quietl fade away?<br /><br />Unlike many authors who share cozy anecdotes, Collins offers solid analytical distinctions.  The survivors faced reality, recognized their strengths, got rid of deadwood and provided quiet leadership.<br /><br />My favorite chapter features the Stockdale paradox. During eight grueling years as a Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale determined he would survive and would save as many fellow POWs as<br /><br />possible. Regardless of anyone's position on war and military, Stockdale demonstrated rare courage and was credited with saving many lives.<br /><br />When Collins asked, \\"Who was least likely to survive?\\" Stockdale said, \\"That's easy - the optimists.\\"  Those who anticipated being home by Christmas were the most discouraged-- most likely to give up on living.<br /><br />In a world of chirpy coaches urging us to \\"Think positive,\\" this view seems realistic and refreshing.<br /><br />I also liked the story of Nucor, a small company that outpaced Bethlehem Steel. While Bethlehem built office tours to accommodate demands for corner offices, Nucor stayed lean and mean. I love the story of a union's attempts to organize Nucor: Management actually had to protect the union organizers from the wrath of the workers!<br /><br />The book is easy to read and hard to put down. And the lessons learned will remain with readers for a long time.	2005-08-08

Disclosure: I bought this book online after hearing Ms Frank's teleclass and then emailed for a refund. Four weeks later, her assistant responded: they anticipated no refunds because everyone loved the book! And a few weeks after that, someone called me, demanding why I didn't like the book! I gave up and donated the book to a local library.<br /><br />Ms Frank autographed my book, \\"Cathy I believe in you.\\" An immediate credibility-buster: does she really believe in everyone who forked over twenty bucks to buy her book? And if so, why?<br /><br />If we believe Ms Frank, her success was lucky but not at all accidental.<br /><br />First, when leaving her abusive husband, Ms Frank needed a lawyer -- and her mother just happened to work for a lawyer who could take the case! Many abused spouses have trouble getting a lawyer to take them seriously.<br /><br />Frank says she walked away from the successful business she had built with her husband. Clearly her \\"accidents\\" began later -- she should have had some kind of written agreement.<br /><br />Second, Frank got involved with computers and then moved easily to training. She was in the right place at the right time with the right talents. She likes to make the move seem easy. When a training company asks for a tape, she just calls someone she knows and asks to give a class. And they say yes! Not many people have those kinds of connections.<br /><br />But the most frustrating part of this book is the misleading title. First, Frank's success was planned. As soon as she left her husband, she sat on her sister's couch and made a plan. (How many abused women have sisters living 3 hours away who can take them in? That's another story.) She writes about the way she set up her website -- but doesn't tell us how she learned these techniques. Accidental? I don't think so.<br /><br />But the real quibble I have is, \\"What can we learn from an accident?\\"<br /><br />By definition, accidents are unplanned and unpreventable!<br /><br />How do we create our own accident?<br /><br />The website tips are easily available elsewhere and they're not clearly explained. Anyway, Frank's own website is filled with links that lead nowhere. I tried to follow links to an advertised class. After being led through a form that demanded all kinds of information -- for a free class - I was taken back to the announcement page! There was no place to email for help.<br /><br />So Ms Frank just is not credible as a resource for Internet marketing.<br /><br />This book will no doubt be purchased by people who hear the author, appreciate her speaking skills and want more. She comes across as likeable so they may be reluctant to criticize.  I suggest catching her on a free teleclass...you'll get everything that's in this book and maybe more.<br />How do we create our own accident? <br /> <br />The website tips are easily available elsewhere and they're not clearly explained.

She had a lot of ideas but no idea where to start moving. And now I can see why!<br /><br />This book offers lots of ways to figure out what you want in an ideal world.  The authors have come up with some novel approaches to self-discovery, such as identifying your drivers.<br /><br />But implementing dreams is a whole other kettle of fish! The authors ignore the realities of job  hunting after 50.  The section on age barriers takes about 1 page (p 230) at the very end of the book.  Whether you're working for a company or on your own, stereotypes and age barriers exist and they're not always easy to overcome.<br /><br />The authors' \\"real people\\" are comfortably situated, when in fact many retirees face financial constraints. Many of my clients have been laid off in their 50's. Some have invaded their retirement accounts (before they called me) just to survive.<br /><br />Even if you have money, you need to be realistic. Volunteer work takes a different kind of energy than working for salary or fees.  Some people thrive on volunteerism; others go nuts.  Living in a small town with many retirees, I've met many who left the workforce too soon. They're bored -- and often are taking medication for depression.<br /><br />On page 181 the authors describe \\"real person\\" Jane, who wants to be a mediator. Mediation, say the authors, is \\"portable and flexible.\\" They may be right -- but we need more information. Mediators often need to market themselves by networking with lawyers.  New mediators find they're up against recovering lawyers seeking new careers as mediators -- who are much better connected than they are.  Of course, some people find lucrative careers as mediators -- but my advice to Jane would be, \\"Find out if there's a market before paying for training!\\"<br /><br />Another \\"real person\\" retired to write a novel - and got published! A very inspiring story -- but I've worked with clients who lacked the skill to write at the professional level. Others lack the discipline to keep going.<br /><br />In my experience (as well as research), career change means testing, trying, and being open to possibilities -- not creating a long \\"possibility list\\" at the beginning.

As a career consultant who works with midlife professionals, and a fan of Sue Shellenbarger, I was eager to read The Breaking Point.  And mostly I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I like the way Shellenbarger treats  midlife crisis respectfully, rather than comparing midlife to a \\"second adolescence.\\"  She begins by exploring her own motivation and then sets out to understand the research in the field.  I am familiar with the work of Professor Elaine Wethington, who is quoted to set the stage for a research perspective. However, I wish the author had reviewed other research and other respected authors, such as Jean Shinoda Bolen's work on goddesses of midlife.<br /><br />Additionally, I was impressed that the author has interviewed fifty women.  And, like many reporters, she makes her  points by narrative rather than summing up.<br /><br />On the other hand, I felt the book's organization could have been tighter.  Shellenbarger identifies six archetypes:  lover, adventurer, leader, gardener, artist and seeker.  The book spends about 30 pages on the lover archetype, which Shellenbarger describes as potentially dangerous, and 15 pages each on the  other archetypes.  Was the lover predominant in her own study? Or did she (and the editors) believe this archetype would draw the greatest interest from readers?<br /><br />It would have been interesting to get at least two or three stories for each archetype. The Gardener, for instance, is represented only by \\"Melanie.\\"  Following a series of career mistakes and miscarriages, the author writes, \\"For most of her adult life, Melanie...regarded herself as a 'happpy, active sensible person with a couople of good friends, a good marriage and a loveable son.'\\" (p 154)<br /><br />Yet the archeype of Gardener suggests someone who has roamed the world and now is ready to come home. Why not give some examples here?<br /><br />Shellenbarger wisely classifies her book as journalism, with no pretense of advice or self-help exercises.  Even so, it is important to recognize that the fifty interviewees will be far from representative.  They've offered to share their stories, which means they had time to do so, and they apparently believed their stories presented a positive image.  They may have experienced some setbacks but they've triumphed.<br /><br />Ultimately, an indirect lesson of this book is that midlife crisis belongs to the rich and educated.  One woman begins twice-weekly sessions with a psychiatrist. All I could think was, \\"She must have had one great health plan -- or lots of  money.\\" These options are not open to most women 40-60. Many find themselves facing a more down-to-earth crisis as they lose jobs  -- or their husbands lose jobs.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Some women will be comforted or inspired as they recognize their own archetype.  But the larger question relates to the way our culture and infrastructure still cling to old stereotypes.  We may be getting stronger, more vibrant and more alive...but what do we do with these qualities?p exercises.

But fans will recognize Scottoline's writing touches, as individual as a fingerprint.<br /><br />From the beginning, we get Scottoline's delicious combination of girl-think with violent crime. Staring down the barrel of a gun, Assistant DA Vicki Allegretti wonders if a black gun \\"makes you look thinner.\\" It's just the kind of combination of gritty suspense and girl talk that we have come to expect from this author -- and she delivers magnificently.<br /><br />Other surprises surface. Allegretti, product of upperclass parents and good schools, teams up with an accused criminal to solve a crime. Along the way, she takes risks, gets suspended from her job, and finds an unlikely criminal.<br /><br />As with Scottoline, the heroine begins to seem like an old friend -- someone we admire and want to follow. And as always, we get a suspenseful page-turner that superbly paced, with not a word wasted.<br /><br />Like many fans, I miss Scottoline's traditional characters: Mary, Judy, Bennie and Anne.  Scottoline takes a big jump here with a character whose parents are both lawyers -- someone from the upper echelons of Philadelphia society.  She seems most comfortable when dealing with scrappy up-from-nothing women like Bennie and Mary,<br /><br />But I wouldn't be surprised to seem them all come together in a future novel (Scottoline has a way of doing that).  Let me guess: Bennie's law firm would be defending a client, Allegretti would be prosecuting, and they'd all unite on the side of justice -- and the pleasure of their loyal readers.	2005-06-16

Authors who follow this pattern include Lawrence Block (in the Matt Scudder series), Jonathan Kellerman, Robert Parker and Kate Stabenow.<br /><br />Why are our favorite authors doing this to us?  In a public talk several years ago, Kellerman referred to a \\"sour book\\" growing out of a difficult time in his own life.  Otherwise, we're clueless.  And anyone who's new to the series will give up -- sadly, because previous and subsequent volumes will be rewarding.<br /><br />Typically, I avoid books that involve religious cults, violence, cruelty and/or twisted psychological motives.  You'll find all these elements in Hard Truth -- but I still loved this book.<br /><br />Why? Well, I'm a dedicated Ranger Anna Pigeon fan.  And we see some truly horrific facts through Anna's calm, detached, and highly intelligent perspective.  In phrases like \\"the damaged child,\\" she communicates tragedy without pathos.  And no matter how bizarre the circumstances, Anna organizes the facts to fit a law enforcement mindset.<br /><br />Introducing Heath, a newly-disabled woman, as a new narrator and potential heroine will allow Barr to keep the series evolving in new and challenging directions. But introducing Heath in this book adds an extra layer of darkness and despair. For many readers, Heath's own horror story will hit much closer to home than most of the events in the main story.<br /><br />Definitely do not begin the Anna Pigeon series with this book.  Barr writes for her long-term fans, skipping details and letting us fill in our own gaps.<br /><br />For instance, I was hoping for a scene of Anna's wedding to her paradoxical lover, the sheriff who doubles as an Episcopal priest, an odd choice for a skeptic like Anna who's most likely an atheist.<br /><br />But author Barr delivers consistency.  Anna remains cool and analytical even when thinking about her own love life.  In an earlier volume, Anna's sister Molly warns an earlier lover, \\"You'll never get Anna out of her wilderness.\\"  Anna's marriage will last as long as she gets to stay there, on her own terms.e.

It's like a road trip, rather than a journey with a destination and a resolution of conflict.<br /><br />The book's major contribution: It's possible to be a habitual user without being a clinical alcoholic.<br /><br />But I wish Zailckas had waited a few years to share her story. She's very close to those years, so she hasn't had time to reflect on what happened and why.  She admits she's not sure why she stopped drinking. And she doesn't offer suggestions or insights that would help parents or others who want to help others.<br /><br />Zailckas does seem to suffer from low self-esteem, although she seemed to have no trouble finding friends and jobs. Her parents seem rather passive and uninvolved. Why didn't they send her to a therapist? Why did they keep bailing her out?  Why did her friends' parents also go into denial?<br /><br />And most important, what will Zailckas write next?  I'll look forward to following this gifted writer as she grows into her talents.	2005-06-13

Sadly, many readers will be eager to accept Grace's view of the justice system. As other reviewers point out, Grace remains influenced by the murder of her boyfriend. She's bitter and biased.<br /><br />This book isn't a reasoned analysis of the legal system; it's a loosely-organized rant.  I can't help wondering about Grace's qualifications: less than ten years in a DA's office followed by a move to television. And I wonder why she left for \\"political reasons.\\" In some jurisdictions, the Assistant DA's hang on regardless of who gets elected.<br /><br />So it's not surprising that Objection delivers a number of ironies and contradictions.<br /><br />(1) Grace criticizes \\"celebrity justice\\" but her own job creates and affirms celebrity. She herself has some notoriety, if not celebrity. Otherwise this book probably wouldn't have been published.<br /><br />(2) While celebrities do have more power and money than ordinary defendants, they also become more vulnerable to threats.  DA's often follow through for fear of appearing weak or biased.<br /><br />As Johnnie Cochran pointed out  in his own book, we can learn a great deal from celebrity trials. If everyone had OJ's resources, we would see more independent tests of forensic evidence -- and perhaps fewer convictions. If I were on a jury, I would not trust any prosecution evidence unless the defense had funds and access to materials for independent testing.<br /><br />(3) Grace criticizes juries for being irrational and starstruck; snidely she speculates that jurors expect to be invited to the mansion.  But if juries fail to reason effectively (which many observers believe - few are trained in logical thinking and critical analysis) we need to question the entire system.<br />For an intelligent discussion of the jury system, readers should turn to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's book, The Majesty of the Law.<br /><br />Grace doesn't go there, and she should.  I've watched jurors interviewed on documentaries. Their reasons for verdicts often are based on their imaginary ideas of what's real, what's true and \\"what I would do.\\"  Common sense is not always accurate or logical.<br /><br />(4) Grace questions why Kobe Bryant's accuser isn't identified as a victim. But (like so many DA's who appear on television) she forgets that Bryant never was tried. He was an alleged rapist.  She's an accuser.<br /><br />And depression alters perception and memory, the basis for the accuser's claim.  Ignoring a mental health record (as Grace implies we should do) is like asking the jury to disregard an eyewitness's need for glasses.<br /><br />There's special irony in Grace's criticism of Bryant's lawyer Mackey, who names the accuser several times during court hearings.  As a DA, Grace herself was criticized by appellate courts for violating boundaries with over-zealous prosecution tactics.<br /><br />(5) Grace criticizes defendants who have \\"teams\\" of lawyers - but DA's rarely act alone. I've read that LA County assigned up to 50 lawyers on OJ's trial.  The bigger problem: most defendants are hopelessly out-spent by the prosecution. Andrea Yates's defense team could not even afford a copy of the full transcript.<br /><br />(6) Grace attacks defense lawyers who play fast and loose with truth. But she doesn't talk about the DA in Tucson whose lies - under oath - sent innocent men to death row.  (He got three years of license suspension.)  I suggest buying Capturing the Friedmans and also Leslie Abramson's excellent, well-reasoned book, Ready for the Defense.<br /><br />(7) Grace claims to protect victims. But prosecuting innocent defendants and fighting for long jail sentences forces taxpayers to pay huge amounts of money, with no return except a feeling of vengeance. We have money for education or mental health, but when someone commits a crime, we have all the money in the world to punish them.  And a falsely accused person is a victim, even if they are found not guilty.<br /><br />I had never watched Nancy Grace before reading this book. Now I think she belongs off the air and out of the legal field.re reading this book. Now I think she belongs off the air and out of the legal field.	2005-06-12

The subtitle promised an \\"approach\\" to \\"fun on the job.\\"<br /><br />However, the book gets only two stars because the title appears misleading. Joy at Work is not about how *you* the indvidual can have fun -- it's more of a memoir.  You'll even find family photos in the middle of the book!<br /><br />What makes Bakke's  AES unique are values, premised on a core concept: Workers feel happier when they have more control over their environment. When they have control, they take ownership, so you need fewer supervisors. Workers have fun *and* the company gets profitable.<br /><br />Frankly, some of Bakke's ideas aren't unique. Why have sick leave? Just let workers stay home when they're sick. Well, at least one large software company has had this policy for years, according to an acquaintance who worked there.  And the notion of empowering workers has a familiar ring, too.<br /><br />Are workers really happy? Does a CEO really know? When Bakke argues for a leaner workplace (which I agree *is* more fun), he sounds remarkably like Jack Welch.<br /><br />On page 156, Bakke questions why shareholder values should drive the firm. Why not focus on employees, he seems to be asking.  But on page 210, Bakke wishes he'd sought more equity than debt, selling more shares more frequently.  Maybe I'm missing something, but investors will be more likely to buy stock if the company focuses on making them, the shareholders, richer.<br /><br />So bottom  line, this book won't help an ordinary person who's perched on the corporate ladder. You have to be a CEO  (with a supporting Board and staff) to implement these values that presumably bring \\"joy.\\"  A manager could create only temporary, smaller-scale changes.<br /><br />My biggest criticism: Books today are judged by their cover.  Nothing on the book's jacket gives a hint that Bakke operates from a system of strong religious values, which he mentions in the text from time to time.  The Postscript (pages 246-277 -- 10% of the book) has been titled \\"The Master's Joy.\\"  It is certainly appropriate for an author to present his religious views and values -- but please tell the reader up front, before we buy a copy or even check one out of a library.<br /><br />Actually we get some clues if we read the 9 endorsements on the back cover, an eclectic mix of individuals ranging from Bill Clinton to a football coach to a US Senator.  Inside the book are 15 more endorsements, from a church pastor, Chuck Colson of prison ministries, and an NFL quarterback.  Only one of the 24 endorsements seems to be from a woman: the androgynously named Lynn Sharp Paine.<br /><br />Appendix A provides a \\"Case Study\\" which is really a timeline, presented honestly. Of special note: AES's initial offering price was $19.25 in 1991. The stock hit an all-time high of $70.62 in October 2000 and then plummeted to $5 a share in February 2002. In June 2002 Bakke retired from the company.

Impossible Thinking emerges as one of the most interesting and best-written books in the Wharton School series. As a Wharton MBA alum, I admit to being biased and wanting to like this book.  And I was not disappointed.  In fact, I just recommended this book to my ezine list.<br /><br />Mental models act like filters through which we see the world and frame questions.  As the authors emphasize, our use of mental models can expand or limit our choices.  An outdated or irrelevant model can lead to poor decisions, even disasters.  Yet knowing when to cast aside a familiar model is not always an easy decision.<br /><br />As a career consultant, I found myself agreeing with the section on career change. We have to replace our models of careers as linear paths leading to jobs performed in specific places at specific times.  And I appreciated the section on intuition, which is similar to what I've created in my own ebook.<br /><br />At the same time, I found myself wondering, what should be our mental model for this book? In some ways, the content and style resemble the two books by Malcolm Gladwell, Tipping Point and Blink: lots of solid psychological information, presented entertainingly, with real-world examples.<br /><br />However, we have discussion questions at the end of each chapter, suggesting a self-help book. And we have a list of academic references, suggesting a quasi-academic book.  Which is it?  Frankly, the authors seem to be stretching to create questions, which are the weakest part of the book. Given the vast resources of Wharton, it's hard to understand why they didn't just hire a self-help author to generate useful exercises.  Or (better) skip the questions altogether and just add more material.<br /><br />The imperative recommendations (\\"Bridge  adaptive disconnects\\") also suggest self-help and they're not especially do-able. And the promise on the book's cover (\\"If you can think impossible thoughts, you can do impossible things\\") suggests a New Age orientation that (I suspect) is far from the authors' mental model.  Inside the covers, we get a more modest promise: Thinking the impossible is a necessary but not sufficient condition for doing the impossible.<br /><br />The content will be useful to many, although anyone who's studied graduate level psychology will be familiar with schemas. The applications will still be new and interesting and I continue to be impressed with the explanatory power of mental models.  In fact, there's a danger of using mental models to explain such a wide range of phenomena that they don't really explain anything.<br /><br />As expected, the authors do best when applying the mental models concept to business (their area of expertise) and are least effective when they stray far afield. The discussion of health models can be criticized because \\"alternative\\" and \\"traditional\\" medicine can overlap more than the authors recognize.  For example, I've seen a Board-certified surgeon recommend vitamin E cream to heal scarring.  Some insurance plans authorize treatment from practitioners of Chinese medicine as well as osteopaths and chiropractors.<br /><br />However, most readers recognize that medical treatments can derive from belief systems.  I wish the authors had discussed the role of mental models in the legal system, which remains deeply rooted in traditions going as far back as 800 years ago.  For instance, juries continually are encouraged to use \\"common sense,\\" yet contemporary science increasingly introduces knowledge that contradicts what \\"everybody knows.\\"  The very notion of retributive justice comes from a mental model that deserves to be questioned.<br /><br />In the end, the questions raised by the book are more important than actual examples.  I'd recommend reading the book just for the authors' ability to provoke thought and raise questions...including questions about the book itself.sts a New Age orientation that (I suspect) is far from the authors' mental model.

The author argues that economic theories have become outdated by our new realities, especially technology and international outsourcing.  The information about specific economies, such as Finland's, is fascinating.  The author's Japanese background forces Americans (like me) to recognize a new perspective.<br /><br />I related to this book because I work via computer from a small town in southern New Mexico. I do business with people I will never see and take receipts (via credit card) from all over the world.  So I live the society Ohmae writes about (except that he needs to revise his belief about technololgical aptitude of the over-40 set).<br /><br />Ohmae is best when he's discussing global strategies on a broad, conceptual level.  When it comes to implementation, the discussion gets fuzzier.  For instance, it's hard to imagine any government voluntarily changing, especially in terms of giving up power.<br /><br />And while new leaders need to be trained in analytical thinking, our current educational system seems to be moving to rote memory, tested by exams. While borders may be coming down, security  measures are going up.<br /><br />I was also a little puzzled by Ohmae's discussion of distance learning. He's right: mainstream universities in the US have tended to regard distance learning as an unwanted stepchild.  Yet he fails to observe that \\"alternative\\" universities have seized the opportunity to attract working adults with money and motivation.  The quality of these non-traditional options can vary a great deal -- perhaps an example of a market failure.<br /><br />I believe this book should be read in conjunction with another Wharton business book, Power of Impossible Thinking.  Ohmae introduces a new mental model: a world where borders disappear as we use ATMs and buy through credit cards.  Yet (as Wind et al point out) some paradigm shifts are two-way streets: many institutions continue to retain old-fashioned gateways.<br /><br />For instance, in the US, we still have archaic state borders that make little sense today.  There's a certain irony when the term \\"long distance call\\" has lost meaning, but if we move across a state line, we need new health insurance.<br /><br />In a more amusing example, I was offered a part-time job where I'd be working from home, over a thousand miles from the institution, communicating over the Internet.  The company sent complex forms that had to be completed by hand (lots of little square boxes) and also a form to sign, promising I would bring no illegal drugs to the workplace.  I do not use drugs but I wondered, \\"Does this mean no catnip for the cats in the room I use for my office? What does 'the workplace' mean when you're telecommuting?\\"<br /><br />I didn't pursue the job ...but after reading both this book and Power of Impossible Thinking (Wind et al.)

As other reviewers have observed, Kellerman identifies five categories of bad leadership -- but they're ad hoc, arbitrarily derived groupings.  Therefore we can't identify systematic causes of bad leadership, which would lead to meaningful prescriptions.<br /><br />Kellerman uses a broad definition of leadership that encompasses corporate leaders appointed by a board, elected leaders, founders of companies (like Martha Stewart), and self-appointed crazies like Jim Jones.  Can we really load all these forms into one category -- and still come up with meaningful conclusions?<br /><br />As others have noted, Kellerman's bias raises questions about credibility.  She faults Bill Clinton for lack of leadership in three separate arenas -- more than any other \\"leader\\" in the book.  Yet Clinton's health care \\"failure\\" can be partly attributed to a huge spending campaign by insurance companies, which she does not mention. His lack of action in Rwanda pales next to foreign policies by leaders who extended wars for political reason and ... well' we won't even go there.<br /><br />As for the Lewinsky affair, Kellerman writes (p 35) that \\"tolerance for moral fallibility, even if evident only behind closed doors, has been low.\\"  Really?  Many American leaders (JFK, LBJ, and others) have had rather varied experiences behind closed doors. Some countries remain baffled by the American concern with our leaders' \\"moral fallibility.\\"  And is Confucius really the appropriate source to cite when discussing modern leaders and their morals? Why not a historian or political scientist?<br /><br />On page 43, Kellerman refers to Martha Stewart's \\"charges stemming from insider trading,\\" noting that Stewart can be \\"mean.\\"  Stewart's legal position has been extremely controversial. Several legal scholars have questioned the decision to charge Stewart with lying to federal officials even when she was innocent of the insider trading charges.  And where does Kellerman learn about Stewart's leadership style? The references cite popular trade books including an \\"unauthorized autobiography.\\"<br /><br />Ironically, one of Kellerman's prescriptions for dealing with \\"bad leadership\\" includes \\"Develop your own sources of information.\\"  That's a good idea for authors, too.<br /><br />Other prescriptions are vague, such as \\"ensure punishment fits the crime.\\" Who's to decide what fits the crime? Does the public gain from incarcerating a white collar criminal? And who decides what's a crime in the first place?  Many reports of misconduct sound like horror stories -- but often the laws are ambiguous and enforcement becomes a showcase for a particular government agency.<br /><br /> \\"Good\\" and \\"bad\\" aren't always easy to identify and I'm not convinced these simplistic dichotomies are the most useful for education, policy, and yes, even leadership.  A book published by HBS press should embody more scholarship and less hype.rading charges.  And where does Kellerman learn about Stewart's leadership style?

The best part comes at the beginning when we see Ivy Ames as the quintessential corporate manager, recognizing the realities of life at the top.<br /><br />As other reviewers note, Ivy becomes an admissions counselor to the rich status-seekers of Manhattan.  And that's where the book straddles the genre fence: part satire, part romance.<br /><br />Ivy's clients provide the satire: a mafia don, an egomaniac corporate head (\\"me? fly commercial?\\"), whiny-voiced mom and more.  Ivy abandons any pretence of ethics in the spirit of winning the admissions game. Some strategies are so over-the-top they're Saturday Night Live fodder.<br /><br />Then there's the romance. Forced to move downtown, Ivy ends up in a charming Greenwich Village apartment, complete with not one but two romantic possibilities, both SNAGs: sensitive new age guys.<br /><br />And then there's the spoiler, at least as far as I'm concerned.  Ivy's good friend Faith just happens to be married to a billionaire older man. Faith paid a high price to get those millions (and we learn just how high when Faith describes the anatomical details of her pre-nup).<br /><br />When Ivy gets into a crunch, it's Faith to the rescue -- and that's bending the chick lit rules. We want a heroine who pulls her own weight and gets herself out of her own messes and into her new world.<br /><br />As a light-hearted romp through the preschool world, Ivy Chronicles can be fun.  But I'd have liked to see just a tad less fluff and a lot more grit.	2005-05-08

I don't understand reviewers who question whether it's \\"really\\" economics.<br /><br />These authors illustrate the way economists think -- which means looking at aggregate trends and understanding correlations.  They also teach us to question \\"conventional wisdom,\\" an overrated product of commonsense.<br /><br />Generally, their ideas make sense and I can't help wishing politicians would take note. However, it's important to understand the limits of aggregated data.  You will find individual exceptions and, to buy into the argument, you have to work within their definitions of inputs and outcomes.<br /><br />So when the authors look at factors contributing to school success, they define success by specific test scores.  When they explore results of school choice program, they measure success by graduating on time -- not by the child's ability to enter college, let alone a good college.<br /><br />Regardless, I loved this book. Microeconomics was one of my favorite graduate school classes and it was fun to see some academic topics (such as information asymmetry) applied to novel and diverse contexts.<br /><br />The book reads like a suspense novel so reading Freakonomics is like eating dessert that tastes like a fudge brownie but really turns out to be good for you.  I just wish the publisher had allowed or invented a better title.  Nothing freaky here -- just good theory and solid method applied in ways that will soon become commonplace.	2005-04-29

They're Jeannette's parents, Rex and Rose, and they look deceptively normal.<br /><br />In fact Rex and Rose were hippie outlaws, raising three children with the same irresponsible love they bestowed on their stray dogs and cats.  True, they gave their children values and experiences that are denied many wealthier offspring. The family read good books and appreciated art.  They played outdoors, learned to swim and (for awhile) rode bicycles.<br /><br />But every so often Rex would disappear on binges. Rose would stay home crying.  Sometimes the family literally went hungry and much of Jeannette's childhood was spent in a shack that lacked heat, electricity and plumbing.  At times the children were physically endangered.<br /><br />Stories like these can become relentlessly depressing , but author Walls kept me glued to the pages. Some stories actually made me laugh out loud.<br /><br />Amazingly, Walls maintains an ironic distance that keeps anger at bay.  She comes closest to bitterness when her father destroys a carefully-planned Christmas and when he raids the children's escape fund.<br /><br />The three older children not only survived but thrived.  I'm waiting for a psychologist feature them as a case study on resilience.  Perhaps they relied on each other to maintain perspective and they had some memories -- however small and dim -- of visiting their maternal Cream of Wheat grandmother.<br /><br />Jeannette's older sister, Lori, should be recognized as an unsung heroine. It was Lori who first moved to New York (after Rex sabotaged one opportunity after another) and then mentored her younger siblings.  Jeannette writes matter-of-factly (p 248), \\"Lori helped me find a public school where, instead of going to clases, the students signed up for internships all over the city.\\"  At the time, Lori would be twenty or twenty-one years old, perhaps two or three years in New York.  And she knew how to help a teenager find just the right school to meet her needs.  I'd like to know what Lori is doing now.<br /><br />Sadly,the fourth child, Maureen, was not so lucky.  Seven years younger, she would have been more isolated, with only memories of the miserable shack in West Virginia.  The siblings help her move to New York at age twelve, but that effort may have been too little, too late.<br /><br />Walls doesn't analyze or even reflect on her own resilience. She just tells her story in a straightforward, simple way that packs a punch.<br /><br />Even more, she doesn't flinch from the ambiguity of her parents. They can be stupid and irresponsible and occasionally cruel.  But they also gave her some magical moments, as when her father looks into the sky on a penniless Christmas and gives her Venus.  And as we get a glimpse of Rex's parents, we realize that he's perpetuating a long line of destructive behavior.<br /><br />More than once, government officials tried to intervene. Each time Rex propelled the family into another quick \\"skedaddle.\\"  We can wonder what would happen if the children had been removed to a shelter. Most likely they would have been separated and they certainly would have been thrust into more rule-bound, mundane environments. Would they have been better off?

And she knew how to help a teenager find just the right school to meet her needs.  I'd like to know what Lori is doing now.     Sadly,the fourth child, Maureen, was not so lucky.  Seven years younger, she would have been more isolated, with only memories of the miserable shack in West Virginia.  The siblings help her move to New York at age twelve, but that effort may have been too little, too late.       Walls doesn't analyze or even reflect on her own resilience. She just tells her story in a straightforward, simple way that packs a punch.      Even more, she doesn't flinch from the ambiguity of her parents. They can be stupid and irresponsible and occasionally cruel.  But they also gave her some magical moments, as when her father looks into the sky on a penniless Christmas and gives her Venus.  And as we get a glimpse of Rex's parents, we realize that he's perpetuating a long line of destructive behavior.       More than once, government officials tried to intervene. Each time Rex propelled the family into another quick \\"skedaddle.\\"  We can wonder what would happen if the children had been removed to a shelter. Most likely they would have been separated and they certainly would have been thrust into more rule-bound, mundane environments. Would they have been better off?  Would they have emerged as strong and accomplished as they did?  Might they have suffocated in a world of normalcy?    We'll never know, of course, but Walls's gift is that she encourages us to wonder.	2005-04-27

When they make a move, what's really going on? This book has the answers. Like the lyrics of The Apprentice opening song, this book reminds us not to take anything personally. It's just business.<br /><br />The first part of Winning describes Welch's philosophy of leadership. Reward the top performers, he says. Take care of the middle and then boot the bottom. Cruel? No, he argues. People should know where they stand.<br /><br />I believe Welch is right -- as long as you appreciate his perspective. He's speaking as a manager and corporations view people as resources. Except for some qualities which he believes can be trained, the company's job is to choose and keep only people who really contribute to the mission.<br /><br />As a career consultant and coach, I often talk to people whom Welch would categorize as misfits. Some were disrupters at more than one company -- who eventually found a home in a unique position or started their own businesses. Some recognized they were misplaced in a particular company or industry.<br /><br />Welch doesn't deal with \\"what happens after ,\\" and that's really not the organization's job. Rather I would encourage everyone to take the feedback as a guide and move to a career that's more rewarding. Hire your own career guide who will be your own resource and advocate.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the best part of Winning is the second half, dealing with individual career management. Often people who achieve great career success cannot explain what happened. Not Welch.<br /><br />I like his criteria for choosing a position, especially the importance of \\"credentialing.\\" Will this job help you move to the next? I've been using a more general term, \\"marketability.\\"<br /><br />And I like his discussion of matching your sensibilities -- i.e., personality and culture -- to the job's. These elements often drive people to new careers, more than the work itself.  He acknowledges that heading down the wrong path can block off opportunities to reach a satisfying career.  Too many self-help authors opt for empty words of cheer, along the lines of, \\"You can be whatever you want.\\"  Welch reminds us that business, like a lot of life, can be tough.<br /><br />And I applaud his realistic question: Are you taking this job for yourself or to satisfying someone else's agenda? Sometimes you do have to subordinate to family or other needs -- but be upfront and don't complain. Just do what you need.<br /><br />Other guidance on getting ahead -- how to be a team player and how to manage a bad boss -- avoid the usual platitudes. Decide on your long-term objective, he says, and make an informed decision.<br /><br />Welch's advice applies, of course, only to well-managed, reasonably sane companies. If you find yourself frustrated with his advice, you probably belong outside the corporate arena. Individual industries have unique customs and informal rules.  Some companies have hidden agendas of their own. People can be set up to fail.<br /><br />But most of the time, you won't go wrong with Welch's advice, even if you've landed in a mess. And if you keep landing in one messy situation after another, it's time to ask what's really going on.he wrong path can block off opportunities to reach a satisfying career.

Because Nancy Atherton promises a light-hearted romp -- what I call airplane reading, something to take our minds off where we are and what we're supposed to be doing.  We don't ask a lot of those books: just smooth writing, comfortable setting, likeable characters and enough interest to keep the pages turning.<br /><br />And that's exactly what Atherton serves up here.  Visiting a nursing home, Lori befriends Ms. Beacham, legal secretary who dies almost immediately.  Lori learns that this unassuming woman has left legacies to all sorts of people, including herself.  And she agrees to take on a quest for Ms. Beacham's next of kin.<br /><br />Atherton breaks a number of mystery conventions with this book, leaving us with plot that's gentle even by cozy standards.  Even MC Beaton wreaks more havoc in her country villages!  A novice writer probably wouldn't be allowed these lapses.  Still, Atherton plays fair with the readers, and I thoroughly enjoyed meeting the characters.<br /><br />As a newcomer to the Aunt Dimity series, I plan to go back and read more.  After all sometimes we don't want a meaty tome: we're satisfied with an airy, exquisitely baked puff pastry.	2005-04-10

Bartlett was sentenced to sixteen years for a first offense of drug-trafficking.  With no self-pity, Bartlett tries to start a new life -- one that will have meaning for her and her family. We learn how the system actually places obstacles in her path.<br /><br /> This book joins others, like Capturing the Friedmans (on DVD), Daughter's Keeper (a novel by Ayelet Waldman) and The Man Who Outgrew His Prison Cell (by Joe Loya) , in raising our awareness of waste of money and human lives.<br /><br />Perhaps the real lesson of this book is that  the term \\"convicted felon\\" increasingly has come to mean, \\"wrong place, wrong time, not enough money.\\" Or, as Johnnie Cochran wrote in his own book, the color of justice is green.	2005-04-10

Apparently that's what she set out to do first with Expecting Adam, then with Leaving the Saints.<br /><br />With a novel, we welcome ambiguity.  We could read Martha's dialogues with her 90-year old father and think, \\"Yes! He seems guilty.\\"  But then we read again and realize, \\"He might just be a confused, naïve and eccentric old man.\\"<br /><br />Yet even in a novel we expect the author to play fair -- to give us all the clues and let us decide.  And in a memoir, we want to get a full sense of the author's experience. If Martha's scars could be explained by a neighbor's attack, we readers should be told.<br /><br />And unlike a novel, Leaving the Saints comes with lots of baggage.  For example:<br /><br />(a) Earlier Beck refers to giving up \\"secure\\" jobs and living on credit card debt (North Star, pp. 271-272).  In fact, she seems to have held only adjunct teaching jobs, which tend to be low, paying and insecure.  In Leaving the Saints, she reports that students began demanding her services and one day a reporter referred to her as a life coach  (On p. 276 of Leaving the Saints, she writes, \\"I was pleased to have a name for what I did, even a cheesy one.\\")<br /><br />(b) In North Star, Beck emphasizes that confrontation is not necessary for healing. In fact, she says, if you're a linebacker for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Mom is old and frail, you don't need to rush over to \\"demand apologies\\" (North Star, p. 156).  Yet in Leaving the Saints, she confronts her frail old father in a dreary room of what she snidely calls \\"Incest Inn.\\"<br /><br />(c) In North Star, Beck compares two therapists - one offering a cheery, \\"You'll be cured in no time\\" and another more distant, \\"You've got a lot of work ahead.\\" In Leaving the Saints, the therapists are identified as \\"Mona\\" and \\"Rachel.\\"  Mona turns out to be a controversial advocate of recovered memories.<br /><br />(d) Beck gives credit to people who were anonymous names when North Star was published - but who can be identified readily after reading Leaving the Saints.<br /><br />Mormons needn't worry about exposed secrets. I know little about Mormonism, beyond missionaries and murder mysteries (e.g., Lee Martin's wonderful series).  Beck didn't tell me much I didn't know (or suspect) already.  And let's face it: these days you can google anything, including \\"sacred garments\\" and \\"temple weddings.\\"<br /><br />Beck does seem to muddle official church rules with rumors (e.g., the rules about socks). She suggests the young BYU faculty members feared dismissal on grounds of \\"poor performance,\\" but in fact scholars who have strong publications and teaching evaluations would be limited primarily by the tight job market, not official reasons for dismissal.  She may be right about her father's limited job options: his publications would \\"count\\" only if they appeared in peer-reviewed journals.<br /><br />But apart from identifying truth claims, this book will appeal to readers who appreciate and even seek out irony and contradiction, because these themes seem to echo throughout Beck's life. For example:<br /><br />(a) Beck's speaking style reminded me (and friends who joined me for a reading) of professors who win teaching awards by presenting solid research-based information in an entertaining way. She refers to training as a sociologist. Yet in her books, especially Expecting Adam, she criticizes academia in general and Harvard, source of her excellent training, in particular.<br /><br />(b) Even those who question the extent of Beck's physical abuse seem willing to pin the \\"dysfunctional\\" label on her family of origin.  Yet her accomplishments are impressive by any standard.  Degrees, best-selling books, Oprah columns - all before age 40.  She's hardly a victim.<br /><br />Overall, Leaving the Saints was weakened by some content and style decisions.  Beck fails to give us a sense of the day-to-day dynamics of growing up in theNibley family, so we have no context for understanding the alleged abuse episodes.  And she gets cutesy when referring to her own body and a particular hospital procedure (which could have been omitted with no loss). One bewildered audience member left her reading murmuring, \\"Scar tissue? What was she talking about?\\"<br /><br />Finally, I would like to see more details of Beck's transition to her new career and post-Mormon life.  Beck really isn't a life coach like the hundreds whose websites echo techniques they mechanically learned in coach school.  She created her own theory-based system, which apparently grew out of her own life experiences as well as her formal training in sociology.<br /><br />Well, there's always next time!sense of the day-to-day dynamics of growing up in the Nibley family, so we have no context for understanding the alleged abuse episodes.

US	43879637	R1H40O7LX9ATVT	1400062314	9571448	Prep: A Novel	Books	4	5	9	N	N	Feels like we're going to school with Lee	Prep held my interest for all 400 pages, but I found myself wondering why.  The novel's strength lies in reporting details rather than plot or character.  Nothing much happens.  Even scenes that have potential to wrench our emotions are defused so quickly we barely notice them.<br /><br />For example, there's a scene involving a newspaper reporter that seems intended as some sort of pivotal point.  Yet it's ultimately banal because Lee was just naive and the school threw her to the wolves.<br /><br />There's a poignant scene where Lee's parents misunderstand Lee's request to drive a classmate to a nearby hotel.  And sadly we can't help wondering if the classmate hadn't been using Lee in some way.<br /><br />Some reviewers say Lee has become a snob, but I would say it's sometimes hard to distinguish Lee as a boarding school student from Lee as a typical teenager.  Lee's father  has no way to compare Lee with the teenaged girls back home, so he interprets her teenage defiance as boarding school snobbery.<br /><br />And while Lee remains a detached observer, a classic loner, it's hard to understand why.  She has a popular roommate. She's accepted by her peers.  She gets along with her teachers . She goes through a phase of cutting everybody's hair.  And even though her love affair has a disappointing ending,  she appreciates the experience. Subtly she feels more at home at Ault.<br /><br />Yet while she's such a careful observer of so much of her environment, she doesn't seem to understand and recognize her own growth.  Ault helps her grow but ultimately leaves her in a place of ambiguity, like someone who has moved from one city but never feels at home anywhere else.<br /><br />In the end, I wanted to nudge the heroine and say, \\"Get over it.\\"	2005-04-04
US	43879637	REC1K536YKDSR	0316172324	968642731	Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking	Books	5	5	7	N	N	Deserves much more than a blink from readers	Malcolm Gladwell is one of my all-time favorite writers and I always rejoice when the latest New Yorker includes one of his articles.  Tipping Point focused on the way critical mass influences everything from crime statistics to footwear choices.  Blink directs our attention (paradoxically) to unconscious thought processes.<br /><br />As always, Gladwell relies on findings from mainstream research to make his points. He cites psychologists whose work belongs on syllabuses of graduate seminars.  Unfortunately, that's where most of their work ends up, when in fact there are enormous implications for all parts of our lives.<br /><br />Blink begins by noting that often we need only small \\"thin slices\\" of information to make predictions about behavior and events. For instance, psychologist Gottman can predict whether a couple will divorce after listening to only a few minutes of dialogue.  Researchers Levinson and Ambady found that they could predict a doctor's likelihood of being sued not from his technical skills, but from an analysis of his personality - based on a \\"thin slice\\" of videotape.<br /><br />Gladwell also addresses the \\"dark side\\" of thin slicing, namely stereotyping.  Because President Warren G. Harding was elected because he looked handsomely presidential, Gladwell refers to the \\"Harding effect,\\" bad judgment associated with thin slices.<br /><br />On the other hand, sometimes a thin slice can be more accurate than a larger picture: judges of jam became less accurate when asked to describe why they favored one brand over another.<br /><br />And conversely, sometimes thin slices are inadequate to make judgments. Police officers, for instance, perform more responsibly if they're forced to slow down, so a one-officer car actually becomes safer: the officer has to wait for backup.  A new music sound fails the market research test, but listeners love the sound when they hear a whole concert.<br /><br />Some reviews have been critical because Gladwell seems to be saying, \\"Sometimes snap judgments work...and sometimes they don't. So what?\\"<br /><br />However, what Gladwell does is identify specific situations when think slices predict behavior - although the behavior predicted may not be reasoned or even desirable.  It's a little scary to think that students who observe ten minutes of a class will make predictions that correlate with student evaluations for an entire term or that ten minutes of observing a doctor will predict his liability for lawsuits.<br /><br />The real problem seems to be that the more thorough, reason-based evaluations may also derive from single cues  - not thoughtful integration of multiple insights. In fact, we may not be capable to moving beyond thin slices.<br /><br />We read thin slices accurately when we have expertise. Thus Thomas Hoving and other art experts detected a fraud from the \\"feel\\" of a piece.  A firefighter knows when it's time to clear out a building. As a career coach I find that clients with lots of corporate experience can read a job interview easily - but they can't trust their insights as they consider a new career field or a business.<br /><br />In fact, recent televised reports of trials show how jurors rely on cues that they interpret through the lens of \\"common sense,\\" not realizing that common sense often conflicts with scientific findings.  One juror claimed, \\"Scott Peterson didn't look sorrowful enough,\\" yet in fact researchers find a wide variety of \\"normal\\" ways of expressing grief.  In a trial of a doctor accused of poisoning his wife, a juror dismissed an expert's theory that the victim died of a heart attack because \\"there was no history.\\" Yet for many heart attack victims, the first symptom is a fatal heart attack.  I can't help wondering if jurors interpret \\"different\\" as \\"bad,\\" just as ordinary people reject unfamiliar music.<br /><br />This book reads as entertainingly as any novel. Many of us will have \\"aha\\" moments, as we learn, for instance, why more women have been accepted into classical orchestras. But ultimately, it is easy to feel frustrated by the gap between scientific knowledge and the realms of marketing, justice, education and other systems.<br /><br />We know why Mary Tyler Moore and All in the Family came close to being denied an audience - yet a promising young musician faces the same system with a less happy outcome.  We realize that people cannot predict how their own minds will function - yet judges routinely ask prospective jurors about bias.<br /><br />These beliefs are no different than those of orchestra conductors who say, \\"Women don't have powerful lungs,\\" yet we continue to confuse common sense - the Harding fallacy - with real knowledge.<br /><br />Blink is the kind of book that should be read, talked about, analyzed, and discussed widely. I wish I could be more hopeful about the ability of scientific findings to change the way we live and conduct the business of society.earn, for instance, why more women have been accepted into classical orchestras.

The author deserves credit for keeping all the players straight -- we get a sense of each personality on the team.<br /><br /> I read Friday Night Lights less as a football book, but as a book about a part of American life that influences the country in more ways than we realize.  In many of our institutions -- elections, courtroom trials -- life imitates football. It's all about winning and losing. And often the players are short-term and expendable.<br /><br />Actually the most important part of the book comes at the end, when we're told what happened afterward and behind the scenes. The movie leaves out key background information about Dallas-Carter: One football hero was ineligible due to a low algebra grade.  Following a bizarre court battle, he was allowed to play.<br /><br />Yet the lesson was not lost on the Dallas-Carter team, as several became involved in armed robberies, just for fun. Instead of heading off to Division I schools, they began serving long prison sentences.  Frankly, the sentences seemed a little unfair, as the system grooms these kids for big egos and delinquency.  Maybe the athletic leagues need some kind of post-season camp for graduating seniors, emphasizing Life After High School Sports.<br /><br />Of the Permian team, only Chavez went on to a really meaningful career. He came from a family of professionals and presumably had some guidance.  The rest of the team survives on blue collar jobs, with a couple of exceptions -- the surveyor and insurance salesman.<br /><br />We can bemoan a value system that puts pressure on the coaches, while paying them 50% more than academic department heads.  But that value system dominates the US, and maybe the world, not just Texas.  Good looks and crowd-pleasing style count for a lot, everywhere.  If we really valued academics, we'd put our money there.	2005-03-07

Although they spend many happy hours together, they never forget their differences. Hassan makes Amir's breakfast each day. Hassan can't read and Amir reads to him, sometimes making up stories while pretending to read.  Hassan is one of those people who seem always happy, despite misfortunes of his class and his physical deformity.<br /><br />One day the boys' relationship is transformed forever by an experience outside their control. Amir's shame and guilt overpowers him and ultimately leads to even more pain.  Amir and his father eventually settle in America, where is proud father now works in a gas station.  As an adult, Amir returns to Afghanistan and gains the opportunity to repay Hassan for his long-ago actions.<br /><br />As other reviewers noted, some parts of the plot involve coincidences that may bother some readers. Amir's wife, Soraya, seems almost too wise and loving.  But the story is gripping -- not the page-turning of a good mystery novel, but the drama of the characters and immediacy of the settings, whether banal American or exotic Middle Eastern.<br /><br />Parts of the novel are extremely painful to read, as the first-person narrator describes his actions with unsparing honestly. And the last chapter offers a model of lyrical writing.<br /><br />My book club chose this book. Otherwise I might not have picked it up. I'm glad I did.	2005-03-03

A few pages later, we learn why: she's a disgraced lawyer with a suspended license, forced to resign her old firm, forced into bankruptcy by her legal fees.<br /><br />Visiting her friend Darryl, operator of an upscale boarding and training kennel, Kendra soon begins a new career as an upscale pet-sitter.  Through a fortuitous alliance with a private detective, she unravels the clues that led to her own misfortunes and learns who was responsible for the dead bodies that she finds along the way.<br /><br />This book belongs to the new sub-genre of mysteries featuring female lawyers who were disillusioned or disgraced. Frankly, some of their career distress seems misguided. Law is one of the most flexible careers. Some law school graduates never get licensed but find satisfying careers as teachers, legal researchers, business owners, corporate executives, and a whole lot more.  Still, to be fair, many lawyers are unaware of their career options and our heroine loved certain aspects of litigation that are not to be found in other lines of work.<br /><br />I gave the book five stars because it accomplishes what's promised in a paperback mystery with a female heroine: high-quality fast-paced writing with likeable (though not deeply drawn) characters.  The book could be a textbook for writing a mystery. When we think, \\"Things can't get worse,\\" they do. When the heroine begins to relax, a body or other disaster appears to complicate her life.  And there's a nice romantic subplot.<br /><br />Unlike most cozy mysteries, Sit, Stay, Slay boldly incorporates a hard-nosed value system that has been criticized by other reviewers.  Some readers will question the heroine's decision to declare bankruptcy, thus relieving herself of her debts. Others will be disturbed by the solution, which raises questions of right, wrong and court-appointed justice.<br /><br />It is important to remember that all literature - including murder mysteries - presents some value system, such as values related to marriage and child rearing. Researchers have found that mystery readers tend to identify with upper middle to upper class values of consumption; if you don't believe me, read the way Robert Parker's hero, Spenser, describes homes, food, clothing and furniture of his clients.<br /><br />I was more disturbed when the heroine allows dogs on the couch (they need to know who's pack leader) and apparently hasn't spayed her dog.  Those are *my* values!<br /><br />And although the author herself is a lawyer, I wondered whether a disgraced lawyer would have such open access to her former firm.  I also wondered about the source of her debts. Wouldn't the firm have bought out her partnership?  Would her legal bills really be stratospheric for a non-criminal proceeding?  Maybe...but I'd have liked some details spelled out.<br /><br />Regardless, I liked Kendra and hope we see her again.  Wisely the author has opened the way toward future alliances that will be rewarding for Kendra and entertaining for us.It is important to remember that all literature - including murder mysteries - presents some value system, such as values related to marriage and child rearing.

Big Sister's Guide targets young women -- twenty-somethings for the most part -- with its breezy, edgy style. It's bright and breathless, the way Sex and the City would play if the stellar quartet decided to go mentoring.<br /><br />Ignore the style.  This is good stuff.  I'd encourage midlife, midcareer workers -- male as well as female -- to sneak this book home in plain brown wrapper.<br /><br />Big Sister's Guide helps readers decode messages of the workplace. One of the best chapters deals with job interviews. When your interviewer caps her pen, time to stop. When he drums his fingers -- you're definitely talking too much.  And assume the interviewer will be unprepared, so bring extra copies of your resume.<br /><br />The Big Sisters give us tips on topics nobody wants to acknowlege. For instance, what if you've got a Bad Reputation? You're interviewing and someone asks, \\"Weren't you the one who--\\"  And you get some nifty comebacks to defuse the situation.<br /><br />In my opinion, the best part comes in Chapter 8: Who can you trust?  Nobody, the authors say. End of chapter. And they are SO right! As a career consultant, I find my mid-career professional clients tend to err on the side of being open -- wide open! -- and continue to be surprised by the fallout. I encourage everyone to maintain the maximum privacy levels possible without getting a Major Reputation as a Serious Hermit.<br /><br />Finally, I like their 3-step planning guide. Whenever you're embarking on a new project, such as a new career, ask yourself, \\"What 3 steps can I take  now that will lead me in the right direction?\\" And if you don't know those steps -- then  (\\"duh,\\" say the authors) your first step is to figure out what they are.<br /><br />So what's missing? The biggest omission relates to asking for help.  Parents, college friends and coworkers rarely offer clear, objective advice.  Twenty-somethings who seek out a career coach or consultant, and who pay the going rate, are rare -- but they're usually moving up fast. They do advise getting professional help with a resume, but not how to choose the best resource.  Next edition might include a section on how to choose and how to hire help. (Free help? Typically worth what you paid.)<br /><br />Otherwise, I recommend giving this book to anyone who's been in the workforce ten years or less...and buying it for yourself at any age!

Ten Big Ones delivers a roller coaster ride in an amusement park, no more and no less. We don't get the depth of, say Nevada Barr or Margaret Maron, but we don't get half-baked attempts, either.<br /><br />Evanovich's heroine, Stephanie Plum, gets herself into one scrape after another. Her car gets shot up. She sees a killer she's not supposed to see. She hides out in an apartment belonging to a dangerous man.  And as soon as she manages to handcuff a bail jumper, you know something's going to go wrong.<br /><br />Parts of this book hover on laugh-out-loud slapstick, especially episodes with Carol the chip junkie and Grandma Mazur. And yet the writing remains consistently high quality, often a model for other writers: \\"Morelli was lean and hard muscled, with wary cop eyes that softened in the bedroom.\\"  Now that's description!<br /><br />So if you can take a deep breath and accept the surreal quality of Stephanie Plum and her life, you're in for a carnival type treat...just don't let yourself wonder what Stephanie Plum says to her insurance company and what they'll charge for comprehensive and collision next year.	2005-01-12

This book is filled with valuable information for business owners, professionals and corporate citizens.  Essentially much of life is about pitching -- presenting ideas and products that we want others to buy.  The title cleverly picks up the double meaning of \\"pitch\\" and \\"pitch like a girl.\\"<br /><br />But that's both a strength and a weakness of the book. Many readers, especially blues, will find the pink vs. blue a little too cutesy.  Many management books identify \\"styles\\" of acting, thinking and deciding.  Lichtenberg chooses to identify styles that get associated with men (blue) and women (pink). But, as she points out, some women are blue and some men tend to the pink..  Some have \\"stripes,\\" as when a predominantly pink male creates a blue cover-up.<br /><br />On the plus side, decoding your target's predominant style will be valuable, regardless of the label. And Lichtenberg rightly points out that \\"blue\\" women often can be perceived as threatening.  If someone is really clueless, they'll need a lot more than one book, but you can get off to a good start here.  Simply being aware of style will add spin to your pitch.<br /><br />Other strengths of this book include general tips on pitching. For instance, I really enjoyed Lichtenberg's story of her friend who screened advertising agency pitches for a fast food account. Those who appealed on the basis of  \\"I'm hungry\\" were likely to be tossed with the \\"So what\\" question.  Those receiving a pitch want to hear, \\"What's in it for me?\\"<br /><br />Definitely worth reading. And while I understand the author's decision to pitch this book toward a female audience, both men and women can benefit from much of the content.	2005-01-04

Agatha shrewdly moves into creating her own detective agency and manages to turn a profit in spite of herself.<br /><br />As always, readers have fun reuniting with the cast of characters -- the vicar's wife, the town policeman, the cats and more -- and watching Agatha Raisin in action. I love having a middle-aged heroine who combines acute business sense with a misguided view of human nature. She's so real and Beaton manages to convey complex emotion in a light-hearted Cotswold romp -- not an easy feat.<br /><br />The plot seemed a little more twisted this time and I had trouble accepting Agatha's flirtation with someone who's obviously destined for villain status.  And while all of the characters are foils for Agatha, one female character turns out to be a little too much like the heroine herself -- a darker and nastier version, to be sure, but sharing Agatha's penchant for impossible crushes on unreachable men.<br /><br />Agatha needs to play against a strong character, like James Lacey, or compete against a truly interesting villain.<br /><br />But not to worry -- I absolutely love Agatha Raisin and hope she doesn't give up on the detective agency.  Like most professionals who retired too soon, she needs a new career!	2004-12-20

Stabenow has added a lighter touch, opening with some snapshots of Kate's excessive helpfulness.  And it was fun to follow Kate around Anchorage, which the author knows well.  Alaska is magnificent in summer and the author captures the feeling well.<br /><br />The plot isn't bad. A wealthy woman pays Kate a huge (unspecified) sum of money to get her mother out of jail after 30 years. The mother needs medical treatment and the daughter is afraid she'll die in prison.  Kate investigates systematically, calling in favors from all over, and soon realizes several parts of the story are unexplained.<br /><br />There are a few odd steps in her detection, such as her decision to have dinner with an influential wealthy suspect. The solution seems plausible but not obvious and the cover-up and the explanation seems a little more tangled than it might be.  The obligatory climax with real physical danger seems a little forced but easy to read and enjoyable to follow.<br /><br />However, I have to agree with other reviewers. Stabenow gives us too many steamy (or pseudo-steamy) sex scenes, where she moves to the viewpoint of Chopper Jim.  Some of his reactions seem more appropriate to an inexperienced teenager, not a middle-aged ladies' man.  We can already guess that Kate would be fantastic as a sex partner because she's so athletic and in touch with her body.  We don't need the details, down to her underwear. Given that Kate is a dignified woman who commands more respect than liking, I feel that we're invading her privacy.<br /><br />And because the tale has been set in Anchorage, we don't get to revisit Johnny and the Park rats.  That's understandable: in any series, the author has to move us away so we won't get bored with the same old scenes.<br /><br />Finally, I lived in Alaska in 1989-1991. Every year Alaska gets more and more like \\"Outside,\\" so I can see where Stabenow has to stretch to give us a sense of place. But I hope she does.  Kate's home must be very different than when the series started. I'd like to learn more.can see where Stabenow has to stretch to give us a sense of place. But I hope she does.

Amy Lincoln, a mature 29-year-old political writer, has risen from a beyond-dysfunctional home in the projects. Following a scholarship to a select prep school, she fought her way into Harvard and then Columbia Journalism School.<br /><br />And now she's feeling stranded. Her too-good-to-be-true boyfriend doesn't seem to be moving to marriage. Her best friend is between marriages. Her father, released from prison for the third time, won't introduce her to his new girlfriend; after all, he's been passing for 36.<br /><br />It's not clear what pushes Amy to start asking questions about her past after all this time. Maybe she is inspired by a young man who crashes a senator's reception, claiming to be a long lost son. For some reason, she gets her father to talk about her long-lost mother, then uses her reportorial skills to track down the missing family.<br /><br />As Amy explores her roots, we're treated to a detailed description of just about everyone she meets -- even people who just walk onstage for a few pages. These detours add color to the novel and I for one didn't mind slowing down.<br /><br />The climactic scene pulls the book together, striking just the right note. We realize how cruelly Amy's mother set events in motion that harmed everyone she knew: her own parents, Amy's father and ultimately Amy herself. True, Amy went to good schools, but there's a hint of scar tissue when she deals with past and present relationships.<br /><br />Sometimes Amy seems extremely mature for a 29-year-old; after all, the author's quite a bit older. She's been through a lot, though, so her character is plausible. Her romantic life is a little more far-fetched, and the ending seems to doom the book to the \\"women/romance\\" category.<br /><br />Overall, though, I enjoyed this book. I get tired of whiny, helpless heroines who can't seem to take charge of their lives, so I found myself liking Amy's strength and her willingness to accept the consequences of her own actions.o the \\"women/romance\\" category. <br /> <br />Overall, though, I enjoyed this book.

But in fact the book held my interest far more than I expected.<br /><br />A lot can be explained by Hilary's Beaver Cleaver upbringing.  She grew up in an old-fashioned small town where the kids played outdoors and she felt loved at home. Her high school teachers encouraged her to attend college at Wellesley, where she excelled, and she later chose Yale Law School, where she met Bill Clinton and pursued her own fascination with child protection law.  She describes her moves to Arkansas and her life in Washington, where she was determined to protect Chelsea. And she clearly loved campaigning for Senator from NY, where by all accounts she has done an outstanding job.<br /><br />True, there are no \\"tell-all\\" tales. While many readers will want to hear her version of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, she dismisses the episode with a reference to marital counseling and a statement that Bill should tell why he lied and \\"betrayed\\" her.  But she does discuss her frustrations with answering questions about her marriage.<br /><br />But while Hilary focuses on her professional rather than personal side, we do get a glimpse into her personality. She shares the scene of helping Chelsea settle into her dorm room (Bill says, \\"Can't we come back after dinner?\\"). She describes Bill's instant bonding with the chocolate lab, Buddy.  And we get a sense of how life is lived when your many of your friends are household names, like Cronkite and Kennedy.<br /><br />We also get stories of meetings with heads of state who visit Washington and others Hilary meets as she travels around the world.  She's diplomatic and careful but we do get a sense of what it's like to sit through dinners with the likes of Prime Minister Bhutto and Prince Philip.<br /><br />Reviewers complain she didn't share enough, but those same reviewers might be quick to complain if she came across as whiny or soul-baring.  When people achieve on a high level, they're not ordinary and we have to respect their differences.  I enjoyed getting to know more about Hilary Clinton's life and I admire her intelligence, energy and tenacity.soul-baring.

It's easy to get hooked on Natalie Goldberg and it's not always easy to say why. In her Long Island accent -- not much changed by living in Minnesota and New Mexico -- she delivers wry commentary on writing much as I'd imagine a zen master lecturing a favorite student.  She can be tough and demanding but she clearly loves her students. And she's very open about her own life, in and out of writing.<br /><br />There's an old saying that we like someone better after we learn their flaws. I listened to Old Friends, ostensibly about writing a memoir, after reading Natalie Goldberg's own story of her two great teachers, her father and her zen master.  It's a nice combination. Here Natalie Goldberg comes across as warmer and easier to know than in Thunder and Lightning and she drops hints about her own struggles, self-accepting as well as self-deprecating.  For instance, it's clear that Goldberg has some bad karma about cars -- and here she adds an anecdote about failing a driving test on a freezing Minnesota morning when she went wrong way on a one-way street.  None of these car stories seem to bother her as much as they'd bother me or most people I know!<br /><br />In the end, Old Friend is less about writing memoir than about getting motivated to write and spending time with Natalie Goldberg.  Sure, we get lots of exercises that could lead to a memoir: \\"I remember...\\" and,  \\"Biggest mistakes I made...\\" but these exercises could also lead to a novel or even a nonfiction self-help book. Mostly her enthusiasm and her examples would make almost anyone grab a pen and paper and start writing -- now! . She captures the excitement of conquering a blank page and really engaging with ideas, using writing to grow our minds.<br /><br />I'd recommend this CD to anyone who wants to write, who's struggling with a blank page, who's gotten jaded and frustrated and wondering why bother.  That's almost anybody who writes, probably. And I'd recommend the CD to anyone who doesn't especially want to write but just maybe wants to try.  And of course I'd recommend the CD to anyone who's met Natalie Goldberg and wants to spend another couple of hours with her, sharing the journey.<br /><br />Postscript: I live in southwestern New Mexico, so people always ask if I live near Natalie Goldberg. She's about eight hours away up in Taos where they get tons more snow than we do!  Some days she probably thinks she's back in Minnesota.pecially want to write but just maybe wants to try.

But as I began taking notes, I realized Frans Johansson really has a new message for all of  us.<br /><br />I recommend skimming the first chapters to get to the second part of the book, and then going back to understand application of principles.  The heart of the book is about the definition of intersectional innovation and the conditions that must exist for breakthroughs to happen -- a combination of individual qualities, environmental support, luck and perseverance.<br /><br />Perhaps the most helpful, most widely applicable guidelines involve planning for failure and, relatedly, moving from quantity to quality.  Prolific authors, artists and business people tend to be successful. They might discard a dozen \\"bad\\" ideas to come to two or three successes.  So we should reward people for actions, not just success. The only true failure is failure to act.<br /><br />I also liked Johansson's discussion of risk, especially the notion of \\"risk homeostasis.\\" If we take risks in one area, we compensate by avoiding risks in another. And a false sense of security can lead to senseless risk-taking.<br /><br />Johansson's examples make fascinating reader and probably helped sell the book. But I couldn't help thinking that he offers little hope to the majority of people who find themselves in environments where they are forced to specialize. Risk-taking and diversity of experience tend to be discouraged and in fact we tend to disparage what I call the \\"winding road\\" career path. Richard Branson is an innovator; on a lesser scale, he'd be a rolling stone.<br /><br />Johansson emphasizes that underlying diversity, most people have a core competence where they've developed a solid expertise. I think that point has to be addressed, along with the need for a social antenna that allows innovators to find a supportive arena.  If you're too maverick, you're dismissed; too conformist, you're not innovating. Where's the balance?<br /><br />For example, Orit Dagiesh, the Bain consultant, must have paid lots of dues to reach her position. And while Johansson says she defies the consultant stereotype, she does so in a direction that enhances her femininity, with high heels and jewelry.  If she'd been more casual or sporty, she might not have been taken seriously. Attractiveness pays, especially for women.<br /><br />After reading this book, I began to see other examples of intersectional innovation. Natalie Goldberg's first book, Writing Down the Bones, mixed Zen Buddhism with writing.<br /><br />And Herminia Ibarra's Working Identity argues for creating new networks to make meaningful career changes.<br /><br />If I were teaching an MBA course in marketing, strategy or product planning, I'd recommend this book. And I'd recommend this book as a gift to anyone interested in business ideas. Those who liked Malcolm Gladwell's book, The TIpping Point (which Johansson discusses) will like The Medici Effect too.oo conformist, you're not innovating.

Good writing, perfect pacing and just the right amount of satire.<br /><br />As a career consultant, though, I wanted to shake these people!  I wish parents would realize that getting into the top schools -- from kindergarten to college -- doesn't guarantee wealth or happiness.  I've met people with Ivy MBA's and top-of-the-line prep school backgrounds who go through midlife crises and layoffs like everybody else.  And I've met people from undistinguished public schools who have outdistanced their privately educated counterparts.<br /><br />That said, it was fun watching the shenanigans of these smart, sophisticated parents. When you're caught up in fierce competition, it's easy to lose perspective, and most of them do.  As other reviewers have said, Sara seems the only level-headed character in the book. I just wonder how she can afford a nice apartment on an admission director's salary.  Private school faculty and staff typically live well below the means of the students.<br /><br />And I object to the mean-spirited comments of another reviewer, who compared this jockeying for position to Martha Stewart's legal challenges.  Martha Stewart brought herself up from a blue collar world by her own efforts. Many legal experts dispute the validity of the charges against her. These parents are, for the most part, headed for an ego trip with their children as pawns for their own status race.  They're very human, but also very funny.	2004-11-23

Those who liked Cameron will find similarities here, but also differences. I will be recommmending both for my career change and business consulting clients.<br /><br />Cameron directly uses \\"spirituality\\" throughout her book, with references to \\"God,\\" who, she says, can be broadly defined.  She appeals to images and emotion.<br /><br />Tharp goes directly to action. She's strictly verbal: no cute sayings, no quotations all over the page. She's as unadorned as the Nike swish and just as straightforward: \\"Just do it\\" could be her motto.<br /><br />Her own life seems starkly disciplined.  Lots of people get up before dawn (they must not have dogs -- mine demands a walk right away) but Tharp actually gives up movies while she's working on a project. Not just movies, but videos as well. Too distracting, she says.<br /><br />The key to art, she says, is practice. Dancers start with class, whether they're stars or corps members. Painters prepare their material. Practice harder, she says, but with \\"purpose.\\"  And practice what's difficult. We tend to practice only what we do well. I think not only of dancers, but of basketball players like Cynthia Cooper, who practiced left-handed dribbling and three-point shots for hours.<br /><br />My favorite part of Tharp's book was her discussion of ruts. A rut can be associated iwth bad timing, a bad idea, bad luck, most likely because you don't realize you have changed and the world has changed.<br /><br />Her advice foro a typical artist problem - when to stop tinkering - is straightforward: When you feel that you have straightened out a messy room, stop! Otherwise, keep working.<br /><br />While I enjoyed Tharp and recommend the book to everyone, I believe it's targeted to people who are already committed to making a living through creativity. Some people have an innate sense of what sells while others struggle with unread manuscripts and unseen artwork.<br /><br />I would read The Creative Habit as a set of ideals, a philosophy rather than a prescription. For example, to get out of a rut, Tharp recommends, \\"Challenge your assumptions.\\"  This is not easy, as few people recognize their own assumptions.  And as for acting on challenges...well, that's a whole new world!<br /><br />Finally, as a career consultant, I am reminded that much of our world favors commercialism over creativity.  Jobs often reward those who stay quietly in their boxes, rather than going outside the box.  Once your creativity awakens, it's easy to become frustrated because there's no place to carry it out.

Blanke has managed to find a fresh, new metaphor for life transitions -- not a small feat! I found this book by accident, tucked high on a bookstore shelf, and wonder why it hasn't gotten more attention.  Perhaps it's because Blanke doesn't exactly blaze new trails, but she does a wonderful job of guiding us through some less-traveled paths.<br /><br />Blanke suggests a five-step process: Build the castle, i.e., create your dream; fat doesn't fly, or get rid of excess baggage; new possibilities demand new solutions; falling isn't failing; and \\"get the bench,\\" i.e., interpret what you hear in the most life-enhancing way.<br /><br />I especially like her practical advice, such as \\"Run on parallel tracks.\\"  I bring the same message to my own career change clients: don't quit your job, but leverage what you have to reach your dream.<br /><br />And I like, \\"Own the ground you've already traveled.\\" Starting over at midcareer is not the same as starting out as a recent young graduate.  I make a similar point: You've traveled a lot of career miles -- now cash them in for an upgrade.<br /><br />Some of her advice takes us to the edge of practicality: \\"Once you start believing in statistics, it's almost impossible to believe in yourself.\\"  This is true -- and almost identical to Julia Cameron's warning: Thinking about the odds can kill creativity.<br /><br />However, I find that anyone who tries to learn more about creativity bumps up against odds very quickly.  Writing conferences tend to be all about odds -- enough to give anyone permanent writers' block.<br /><br />At the same time, understanding odds can be liberating: you realize you must send out dozens, maybe hundreds, of queries to get any response.<br /><br />Perhaps the most fascinating part of Blanke's book comes in her stories of people she helped.  She describes, for instance, a lawyer who gets fired after her boss feels threatened, but then moves to a new firm where she's more appreciated. Another lawyer learns to present herself more confidently.  And a laid-off mid-career executive discovers a new career, while finding a way to keep alive his dream of a teenage safe driving program.<br /><br />Blanke draws extensively on her own corporate background -- twenty years with Avon, where she rose to vice president.  She combines practical advice -- sending someone to a personal shopper, for instance -- with encouragement to dream big.<br /><br />And I especially like the way she sidesteps traditional assessments in favor of questions like, \\"When was the last time you felt great about what you were doing?\\"<br /><br />Between Trapezes will help career changers validate their feelings of being caught in the air without a net.  I would recommend Between Trapezes to my own clients, as much for her philosophy as for her specific suggestions.  If nothing else, it's a good antidote to the dozens of \\"dream-and-do-it\\" books floating around out there.Another lawyer learns to present herself more confidently.

I wish we'd had more of both.  I'd like to learn even more about his earlier ventures.  And the show: What was it like to share rooms as if you were still in college? After all, participants are seasoned business people!  What was the pressure like? Why did so many talented people seem to fall apart?<br /><br />Rancic acknowledges that calling The Apprentice \\"reality TV\\" is a bit of a stretch.  He discusses strategy rather than experience, which was interesting -- but let's face it, we readers are always hungry for more Behind the Scenes.  He offered a curious insight: The winning team actually got less face time with Donald Trump, because they were spared the Board Room.  So a consistent winner would remain under the radar screen.<br /><br />Season 1's participants seemed more diverse than Season 2's. In Season 2 I often have trouble telling some of the people apart! No problem with Season 1.<br /><br />And of course it's nice to know there's life after The Apprentice.  Rancic's story of starting work on a huge construction project is fascinating and I would have welcomed much more detail.<br /><br />The business advice?  Nothing sensational here. It's the Bill Runcic story that sells books!	2004-11-16

When the network seemed to be pushing her off the couch in favor of Deborah Norville, Jane did the classy thing: she quit!  Before she married she talked about her cats and after she married she didn't talk about her husband.  And who wouldn't like someone who married the creator of Doonesbury?<br /><br />But I keep recalling that \\"happy families are alike...\\" and mostly Jane Pauley has had a happy, even a charmed life. Her home life was happier than most. She was a cheerleader in junior high, a debater and a representative to Girls State and Girls Nation. She joined a sorority in college. Her career came to her and she made the most of every opportunity.<br /><br />So I found myself continuing to like and admire Jane Pauley as a person, while getting increasingly frustrated as a reader. Skywriting feels like meeting someone at a formal dinner and learning just what's appropriate for a professional person to share.  But that's not what I think most people want from an autobiography.<br /><br />People read about the lives of others because we want to know their pain as well as their pride. Voyeuristic, yes, but we learn from stories of triumph and redemption. We learn from getting answers to questions like, \\"What was she thinking when...\\"  We want experiences, not events.<br /><br />You can still be professional while telling a good story.  Recent examples include autobiographies by Katherine Graham, General Claudia Kennedy, and Queen Noor.  These authors give us a glimpse into themselves and their worlds, while maintaining high standards of propriety and good taste.<br /><br />So as a person, I admire Jane Pauley because she doesn't talk about Garry Trudeau. As a reader, I want to know, \\"What's Trudeau like around the house? Do you get to enjoy his biting wit all the time? Does he talk about his Doonesbury characters?\\"<br /><br />And aside from outbreaks of hives, what was Pauley's experience of being diagnosed with bipolar disorder?  Since she's gone public, does she feel she's helping others? Beyond a reference to spending time in a hospital's VIP room, we get little background.  Was she also seeing a therapist? How did her family respond to the diagnosis?<br /><br />And what about Jane's network experience? What did she feel on dealing with Norville? Was Barbara Walters a helpful mentor or an aging star who resented her replacement?  Or if she chooses to be analytical, what does she think of the fine line between news and entertainment? What's her view of the role of women in broadcasting?<br /><br />Sure, these questions are awfully nosy and impertinent, and they're really none of the reader's business.  But to my mind, that's the purpose of autobiography: to go beyond closed doors and glimpse the person behind the persona.  I can respect anyone's wish for privacy...but you give that up if you choose to write an autobiography.ives, what was Pauley's experience of being diagnosed with bipolar disorder?

I didn't expect to like this book, as I wasn't familiar with the Amy Fisher of the tabloids. But Fisher, now a newspaper columnist, tells her story honestly, without asking for pity.  And for the most part, it's a story worth reading.<br /><br />Fisher's title makes the theme. \\"If I knew then...\\" If she'd known about the consequences of her actions, about how to deal with an abusive family, and a whole lot more, none of this would have happened. But that's precisely the point. She didn't know.  And her parents were not available to teach her.<br /><br />Fisher's mother worked full-time, leaving Amy to her own devices. Some young women can handle independence; Amy couldn't. Her father was abusive and impatient. So when Amy damaged her car, she felt desperate. And when a thirty-something mechanic offered to help her, and then expected sexual favors in return...well, she was in way, way over her head.  And when this man started hinting, \\"Wouldn't it be nice if you'd help me kill my wife...\\" Amy went from being a naive high school girl to convicted felon, almost overnight.<br /><br />Many readers say, \\"Come on. Surely she knew what she was doing.\\" But teenagers aren't sensible or logical and they don't know what they're doing. They disconnect actions and consequences, even if they have loving, stable parents.<br /><br />Once caught up in the legal system, Fisher paid more than her share of dues. Interrogated by the cops, she reports the typical response: at some point, she'd say anything if she could just stop. She describes mind games, with the interrogators holding back food and drink until she \\"gave\\" them something.  She didn't know how to hire a lawyer, so she ended up with a longer sentence than she might have gotten otherwise. Advised not to contact her victim, she didn't share her remorse for many years.  And she testified against Joey - who received a mere slap on the wrist for statutory rape.<br /><br />Fisher's account of prison life is sadly familiar: brutal guards, lack of dignity, singled out for abuse because she was \\"high profile.\\"  It's not clear why we taxpayers continue to support those institutions as we move into the twenty-first century.<br /><br />Fisher's survival is a testament to her own strength. After prison, she went on to build a career for herself as a free lance journalist, as well as a life with marriage and children.<br /><br />And she takes responsibility for her actions, now that she's old enough to realize what's going on.  But I still wish we'd spend less money on our prisons and more on programs targeted to teens, even teens from families that seem great on the outside.  Somehow this tragedy should have been prevented.iar: brutal guards, lack of dignity, singled out for abuse because she was \\"high profile.\\"  It's not clear why we taxpayers continue to support those institutions as we move into the twenty-first century.    <br /> <br />Fisher's survival is a testament to her own strength.

However, increasing choices doesn't bring pleasure. In fact, we're more depressed than ever before!<br /><br />Schwartz devotes the entire book to explaining this paradox. What makes the book worth reading is, first, Schwartz's impeccable references to mainstream psychological research.  In particular, Chapter 3 \\"Deciding and Choosing\\" summarizes a greal deal of decision theory in straightforward, readable language.  Anyone embarking on the study of psychology or consumer behavior would do well to read this chapter with care.<br /><br />And second, Schwartz explains phenomena that we experience every day: buying airplane tickets, visiting grocery stores, and more.<br /><br />As a former marketing professor and current career consultant, I beleve Schwartz's theory has more relevance for consumer decisions than for life decisions, such as career choices. True, novelty effects wear off (adaptation) and constraints can actually induce satisfaction.  But not everyone faces a dazzling array of career choices, potential mates or even health insurance options.<br /><br />Even so, nine of Schwartz's ten tips for dealing with choice make sense for just about any situation.  \\"Make choices irreversible\\" does not make sense for careers.  Any job or career can end unexpectedly, and I encourage everyone to keep an eye out for new options.  And there's a fine line between learning to love constraints, which Schwartz enocurages, and giving up autonomy.<br /><br />Chapter 2,\\"New Choices,\\" is the most frustrating.  Some topics covered in a few paragraphs actually deserve a whole book, or at least a whole chapter.  In fact entire books have been written about choosing medical care -- not choosing doctors, Schwartz carefully points out, but choosing what the doctor will do.  This area is quite troubling; while ordinary patients feel baffled when called upon to choose a treatment, many choices are restrained by technicalities or insurance.  In Women's Bodies, Women's Minds, Christiane Northrup writes that insurance will cover pills, for instance, but not massage.<br /><br />The sections on choosing religion, love and identity are equally frustrating -- like getting one bite of chocolate cake without a complete piece. The endowment effect (discussed briefly in the context of money-back guarantees) would seem to act as a natural brake on choices and the decision to choose.  And many people don't feel they have as much choice over how they work as Schwartz would suggest.<br /><br />This is a book to own and re-read, and implications extend to other arenas. For instance, Schwartz cites evidence to show that explaining a decision changes both the content of the decision and subsequent satisfaction with the decision. How does this finding relate to, say, jury decisions involving life and death?<br /><br />Finally, Paradox of Choice was published in 2004 -- well after 9/11. Most people I know feel their choices have been constrained a great deal in the last few years. Travel has become more of a hassle and jobs are scarcer.  So are we happier?  Readers can decide for themselves.<br /><br /> .while ordinary patients feel baffled when called upon to choose a treatment, many choices are restrained by technicalities or insurance.

Fascinated by her father's career and her Nancy Drew books, she remembers keeping a log that includes every neighbor's license plate. She wants her father to bring home stories of exciting crimes he solved.<br /><br />Reviewers have focused Maura's father, Joe, who refused to talk about his work and in fact didn't talk much at all. However, linguist Deborah Tannen has written about the differences in male and female communication styles and John Gray reminds us that men are from Mars. Men just don't want to talk about \\"my day at work.\\" Like Joe Conlon, they communicate through action.<br /><br />Reading between the lines, Joe was trained as a lawyer. Although he carried a gun and badge, he probably worked in offices, pushing paper rather than chasing bad guys. He might have been assigned to white collar crime. Here's a clue: he came home regularly for supper nearly every day. So there probably weren't a whole lot of exciting stories to tell.<br /><br />And we should note that he didn't brush off Maura's questions with ridicule: he just changed the subject. Once he even shared a \\"trick\\" of looking out the rear view mirror, probably acquired from another agent who was more active in actual criminal pursuit.<br /><br />Joe took his kids out to play baseball on Saturday afternoons (another clue: bad guys don't work nine to five weekdays). He even built a ball field. He did chores around the house, apparently without complaint, everything from changing diapers to folding laundry and mowing lawns.<br /><br />Most significantly, he didn't withdraw when his last child, Joey, was born with Down's syndrome. Joe not only remained a caring father, but also raised significant funds for a group home for other developmentally disabled children.<br /><br />Maura's mother, a former beauty queen, never seems too tired or impatient to spend time with her five children. She's creative and playful, sensitive to Maura's need to attend public school rather than continue to an all-girls Catholic high school.<br /><br />However, the mother's ideas seem more progressive than her cooking. The family dinner table seems more fifties than sixties. I have to admit I admired the way they managed to stay slim and healthy while eating endless servings of processed, high-carbohydrate food.<br /><br />And the children seem remarkably unselfish, as they pitch in to care for Joey resisting stares and embarrassment. This family learned the joy of living with a developmentally disabled child in a time, place and social environment where those attitudes were hardly commonplace.<br /><br />Even the nuns are remarkably benevolent; one fussy teacher who complains about Maura's E's in handwriting class, but she melts as she learns more about Maura.<br /><br />Because the book focuses so intently on family, it's hard to get a sense of the role of friends in Maura's early life. She mentions being neglected by the popular girls but we don't get episodes of real meanness or of the close friendships young girls typically develop.<br /><br />Now comes the challenge: How does Maura Conlon-McIver keep the pages turning while describing a happy childhood? She's not sticky or sentimental. She tells the story with crisp sentences, studded with original metaphors.  Most importantly, Conlon-McIvor paces the story as if she were writing a novel, no easy task when writing a memoir.<br /><br />Toward the end, she reports a tragedy that scars what should have been a happy climax to her grade school years. And she ends on a bittersweet note, growing aware of her talents but also her family's unspoken conflicts.<br /><br />I once heard a psychologist speak about families on thebasis of real research rather than myths. He claimed that families held together based on what they didn't say, rather than on openness. Perhaps it is the unrealistic expectation of free-flowing communication that harms families, rather than the actual silence. And maybe the Conlon household wasn't perfect, but I bet a lot of people would have gladly traded places with any member of that family.sychologist speak about families on the basis of real research rather than myths.

Here she writes of feeling betrayred by two father figures, her natural father and her Buddhist teacher Katagiri Roshi, the bartender and the monk of the subtitle. Attending an abuse group, she begins to remember episodes from her childhood and she wants her family to acknowledge how they harmed her.<br /><br />Without sparing herself, and with a hint of irony, Goldberg writes of confronting her parents by letter. They react with almost comic bewilderment.  Goldberg's mother, Sylvia, a child of immigrants, views the world literally: did you eat and sleep? Were you warm?  Her father, Buddy, ran a \\"rough\\" bar for years. His response to Goldberg's accusations was, \\"Were you on drugs?\\"  Psychology, the author summarizes, was developed in a country outside Brooklyn.<br /><br />Even after the family reconciles - which means she begins speaking to them after three years - Goldberg's parents still don't understand her new life. When Goldberg offers to give them a Zen experience, her father begins singing along with the silence bell. In one of their last visits, Buddy whispers an insulting remark about Natalie's weight.<br /><br />The author gets her second shock, as word spreads about Katagiri Roshi's numerous love affairs with Zen students.  She begins to remember episodes she'd tried to ignore. She recalls Roshi's remarks about her beauty.  And ultimately she recognizes that Roshi gave her a tremendous gift, regardless of his personal life.  She writes (page 136) that both artists and religious leaders can be \\"enlightened\\" in their work, yet function \\"cruelly and ignorantly\\" in their personal lives.<br /><br />Toward the end of Great Failure, Natalie writes about crashing her car while fiddling with knobs on her tape deck. She adds, almost casually, that she'd been given \\"two or three\\" speeding tickets in the past six months, including one where the police actually chased her down.  These episodes were disturbing.<br /><br />She realizes she's acting out rather dangerously, and she realizes she's in an in-between phase, losing Roshi but not finding another touchstone. She doesn't judge herself, just reports, and in fact people often do behave in unusual, even bizarre ways when they're in the eye of the transitional hurricane.<br /><br />I think the key to this book is Natalie's wish to be remembered like her heroes, not just as a writer, but as someone who dealt with loneliness and made mistakes.  Because she tells these stories about herself, that's exactly how she will be remembered.turbing.

Marty Nickerson doesn't want to say no to Harry Madigan, her lover and law partner, so she agrees to defend Harry's old flame in a murder case.  Louisa Rawlings admits she was considering divorce when her husband disappears and when his body gets washed to shore.  She protests her innocence convincingly, yet District Attorney Geraldine Schilling won't budge.  Louisa's fingerprints turned up on what seems to be the murder weapon. Louisa was named sole heir, disinheriting husband's daughter.<br /><br />Marty wishes her client would agree to some kind of plea bargain, but Louisa claims she can't name an accomplice because she's not guilty.  And she wants Marty to help her find the real killer.<br /><br />The courtoom characters comes across with lively humor: an eminently fair African-American judge and a stubborn prosecutor. Realistic? Well,most judges are ex-prosecutors and this judge actually respects the defense. And prosecutors are quick to accuse family members and don't like to back down.<br /><br />In spite of herself, Marty begins to admire the defendant's spirit and she's slightly envious of Louisa's ability to charm everyone she meets, including the prison matrons.  And she really wants to see this woman go free.<br /><br />Conners creates suspense because we, as experienced mystery readers, know Louisa can't be guilty.  And she piles on the danger, revealing incriminating evidence that seems unshakeable.<br /><br />Louisa seems headed for a maximum security prison until the very last section of the book. We realize something's got to happen, and it does -- right in the last few pages.  Conners does an excellent job of ending the story in just a page or two at the very end.<br /><br />The human interest subplots add to the interests. Kydd, the near-perfect young associate lawyer, may be headed for an imperfect romance.  Marty's son Luke seems ambivalent about college.  These stories, along with the author's gift for explaining complex courtroom maneuvers, will keep us watching for the next volume in the series.<br /><br />A good read...for a cozy winter evening, a long plane trip or just a Great Escape from the tedium of the tube.om maneuvers, will keep us watching for the next volume in the series.   <br /> <br />A good read...for a cozy winter evening, a long plane trip or just a Great Escape from the tedium of the tube.	2004-10-25

Seligman's book shows that he's a beneficiary of Banker's Paradox: (p 186): the more you have, the more you can get. A successful professor, researcher, author and (icing on the cake) president of APA -- you have license to create, and Seligman uses it wisely.<br /><br />I heard Seligman's APA Presidential address many years ago, where he openly questioned the claims of traditional psychotherapy. Some folks applauded; some actually walked out.  Perhaps his greatest contribution is his questioning of traditional therapy, especially Freudian emphasis on childhood as the source of current ills.<br /><br />Additionally, Seligman wisely deplores traditional psychology's emphasis on \\"what's wrong with you.\\" That's probably why \\"life coaching\\" has become a bonanza. People want to talk about their lives but they don't want to be in a one-down position, as patients with a diagnosis.<br /><br />That said, this book offers a simple introduction to what he calls Positive Psychology.  Ironically, much of what Seligman offers echoes what we've already read in the unscientific pop psychology books that we find everywhere.  Some, of course, were written by authors who have PhD degrees in psychology but no longer practice.<br /><br />For example, Richard Carlson's \\"small stuff\\" books make points that are scientifically valid: Hashing over sad childhood memories leads to sad moods, which cause us to remember more sad memories, and so on.  Wayne Dyer's books encourage us to express gratitude and forgiveness.  So I think Seligman needs to be even more scientific to distinguish himself from the \\"self-help\\" section of a major bookstore.  It can be done: Annie Paul's Cult of Personality is a fine recent example.  Gilovich, Dawes and Russo have used research findings to create readable but helpful guides to decision-making.<br /><br />Pop psych books are, by definition, aimed at a mass audience. Therefore, they appeal to people who feel some pain and want to change their lives. In contrast, it's hard to see who Seligman wants to reach.  Scientifically trained readers (like me) will want to read original journal articles. And Seligman's prescriptions tend to be vague or targeted, as he suggests in the \\"love\\" chapter, to making great lives better.  If you don't have a great life to start with, you can get pretty discouraged!  A newly-divorced, newly-fired fifty-something reader won't find much help here.<br /><br />In particular, the chapter on Signature Strengths seems quite valuable. (Skip the tests in the book - a big waste of paper - and go right to the Internet.) I took the website test and sure enough, I \\"owned\\" the results.  But, I pondered, what next?  I score off the chart on \\"love of learning.\\" No surprise! But if I were searching for a career or a mate, how would I use this information?<br /><br />Seligman's chapter on careers doesn't seem focused. He encourages us to distinguish a job, career and vocation. (Carolyn Myss -- definitely a non-scientist! -- makes the identical distinction in her Advanced Energy Anatomy Tapes.)  And perhaps many people can find ways to transform mundane jobs, like the orderly in the hospital who brings pictures to patients.<br /><br />But some people thrive on jobs that bring money, leaving them time and resources for pursuing their own personal interests and philanthropies outside work.  Pollan and Levine make this point in Fire Your Boss.  And some will be such misfits, and so desperate to take any job, they will have trouble applying this framework.<br /><br />Seligman's discussion of work now seems quaint in the post-9/11 era, when choices are less abundant than before. He focuses on young lawyers who leave high-paying jobs, possibly because he researched or consulted with law firms. He suggests ways the firm could use the talents of these young, smart people.<br /><br />But firms have little interest in keeping employees happy, despite years of organizational behavior theories.  They want results!  I'd haveliked to see suggests for employees to create their own jobs, not passively wait for the firm to come up with solutions.<br /><br />Additionally, signature strengths can't be discussed in isolation.  Sure, a lawyer might spend weeks alone in the law library, but social intelligence informs him what's important, when to challenge an assignment, how to talk to the partners and associates and a whole lot more.  Indeed I would argue that social intelligence might be a better predictor of success and happiness than, say, creativity. Business firms say they value creativity, but, in my experience,  not with their dollars. Barry Staw of UC Berkeley wrote a provocative article on this very topic.<br /><br />Finally, Seligman doesn't address differences of race, gender and class.  I'd argue that a male whose signature strength involved creativity, learning, or wisdom might be valued more than a female with similar strengths, and therefore find it easier to deploy those strengths. If you're not a privileged white male, you'll need social intelligence more than any other quality.<br /><br />Seligman illustrates many points with examples from his own family, like Wayne Dyer does.  At times these examples seem like annoying intrusions. And he interacts with the elite members of academic psychology (very few women, I noticed!), to whom he has unique access. There's a fine line between reporting and name-dropping and at times he blurs the distinction.<br /><br />Overall, you can't disregard Seligman's courage in presenting what many of his colleagues would dismiss as silly.  Without his distinguished track record, he wouldn't be heard at all. Or, put another way, he has chosen to use his fame to promote a very worthwhile cause that can, eventually, help others.ories.

Loya, a gifted speaker and writer, tells his story with unsparing honesty, even with a touch of humor. His book can be read as a testament to the power of circumstances.<br /><br />Loya's early years were happy ones. After his mother died, Loya's father became abusive, and Loya felt helpless to help himself and, especially, his younger brother. Out of this rage grew a career in crime, particularly bank robbery. By the end of his career, Loya had robbed something like two dozen banks.  The end was inevitable.<br /><br />Once in prison, Loya adapted. As he demonstrates vividly, the only way to survive in prison is to develop an accommodation to violent people and violent behavior.  You can't show weakness. You never back down.<br /><br />Loya doesn't philosophize about prison, as Jean Harris did in her books about Bedford. He was young when he entered the system and didn't have the tools of life experience or education.<br /><br />Actually he bears some resemblance to Frank Abegnale, author of Catch Me If You Can, also an incidental criminal whose career began following an unstable home life.  And like Abegnale, he recognizes that his life after prison was made possible only because he could start a new career.<br /><br />Abegnale became a security consultant.  And Loya, thanks to the mentorship of Richard Rodriguez, became a writer and performer.<br /><br />Ironically, Loya's transformation comes from what many would view as a miscarriage of justice. Falsely accused of involvement in the murder of a former cellmate, Loya gets sent to solitary confinement for two years of his seven-year sentence, solely on the basis of suspicion.<br /><br />During this time, Loya realizes he's starting to go mad, and he realizes he has to change. He looks back on this time as a period of transformation.  Ironically, Loya never speculates on the injustice that sent him to solitary confinement for such a long period of time. In essence, he was punished for a crime he never committed, with no restitution available or even considered.<br /><br />After awhile the investigation gets dropped and Loya gets returned first to the general population, then to a pre-release setting with lower security.  And he's incredibly lucky to have his brother and other family members waiting on the outside.  His brother helps him find low-level work till he can begin his writing and performing career.<br /><br />This book is powerful as a story of a life that defies stereotypes. Loya's background combines his Hispanic heritage, his father's love of learning, his own academic achievement, the fundamentalist church that could be stifling as well as protective, and a whole lot more.<br /><br />Loya's father was never  punished for his abusive behavior.  In retrospect, the children should have been removed from the father's custody, although the other relatives weren't especially suited to raising a bright child. Loya's grandmother couldn't read, and  he vividly remembers being angry when she lied about it.<br /><br />But jailing the father wouldn't have helped anybody in this family. Ironically, prison freed Joe Loya, who paid for his father's mistakes along with his own.<br /><br />At his reading, Loya said most people who are in prison don't belong there: they're not harmful and we're wasting resources.  He also said that he's estranged from his father, who didn't like the way  he was portrayed in the book.<br /><br />Joe Loya is an articulate, courageous man, who's finally found a way to make a contribution.  I'm looking forward to his next book, which will be about  his life after prison.  And I wish we as a society would learn more from books like this one.s on the injustice that sent him to solitary confinement for such a long period of time.

Like many unknowledgeable viewers, I find the game slow.  Sure, my friends say, there's lots of strategy. But it's not the kind of game you can just watch a few times a year, like football, and still get involved.<br /><br />But this book is only secondarily about baseball. As a career consultant who helps clients navigate tough decisions, I'm fascinated by the psychology of decision-making, and I read everything I can find.  All the research comes to the same conclusion: statistics win over experience, every time.<br /><br />And that's the story of Money Ball. A contrarian GM looks at the numbers to choose undervalued players. To Billy Beane, each player is an asset in a portfolio. His goal is to buy undervalued assets and sell overvalued assets.<br /><br />The difference: Investors just hold assets in their portfolio. Billy Beane is more like a real estate investor who fixes up houses or waits till the world comes to his small town.  After buying undervalued players, he showcases their true value by setting them on the playing field. A pitcher who \\"looks funny\\" turns out to be a star. An over-the-hill player thrives in a new position.<br /><br />So what's the lesson for the rest of us?<br /><br />First, Lewis raises the question of valuing people who do different kinds of jobs, where results aren't measured as easily. Ultimately, we're all assets. Employees working for a large firm need to regard themselves and their employees with the same kind of detachment. Investments in HR programs either raise the value of their assets or they're a waste of money.<br /><br />And there's an inadvertent lesson here, too. Statistics help Billy Beane choose undervalued players so he can win division titles with a smaller budget than the competition. But when Billy faced his own big decision -- accept a Stanford scholarship or go pro immediately -- he had no statistics. We still need a method to make those kinds of decisions, and that's why I enjoy working with my career changing clients.  You need more than a comparison of pros and cons.and that's why I enjoy working with my career changing clients.

US	43879637	R64QUSYSS5NUZ	0312324928	52263761	Southern Fried	Books	5	10	10	N	N	Delightful debut!	Avery Andrews, fired by her law firm after exploding at her own witness, returns home in disgrace. However, she soon gets involved in legal problems of the locals, which begin trivially but soon find her dealing with arson and murder.  Avery deals with a colorful cast of characters, most of whom date back to her own high school days, as she solves her legal cases and realizes she just be stumbling onto a second, unexpected career.<br /><br />I gave this book five stars because it delivers just what's promised: a small-town regional cozy. If you liked the Maggody series, you'll probably like Southern Fried, although Maggody's characters are so broad they come close to parody.  Here they're just this side of southern plausible.<br /><br />As other reviewers noted, Southern Fried is remarkably professional for a first novel. Dialogue is crisp and believable. Pickens maintains a brisk pace.  Transitions are smooth and settings described economically.<br /><br />As a career consultant, I have to say that I did raise an eyebrow about the heroine's past and future.  The only lines that didn't ring true were Avery's musings over being unemployable.  It's hard to find a more marketable field than law.  Avery was fired but not disbarred. She could do free lance legal research or hang out her shingle anywhere she could pass the bar exam.  She could teach business law.<br /><br />But that's a mere quibble, and Avery's fiery exit from her law firm seems to fit the mood of the book. I hope to read more from this author .	2004-10-02

Blanchard and Homan have set out to demonstrate the benefits of coaching to readers who may not have experienced the process first-hand.  Some readers will be looking for ways to change their lives; others want a preview of what's in store if they hire a coach.<br /><br />It is important to understand that Blanchard and Homan are explaining a very specific type of coaching, what could be called \\"mainstream\\" coaching, identified in many minds with the original CoachU under the leadership of Thomas Leonard.  If  you hire a graduate of another coach school, or an independent coach, you may get a whole different experience.<br /><br />Even more important,  Blanchard and Homan seem to be exceptional as people and as coaches. They share a a fairly sophisticated understanding of business.  Many -- some would say most -- coaches do not resemble them. Going to coach school doesn't automatically create a business, career or relationship expert.<br /><br />For example,  I really liked the section on managing one's strengths, a topic that is rarely discussed.  The authors describe what happens when young lawyers begin to do well, intimidating the partners. As coaches, they helped their clients overcome these obstacles to success.  But not every coach has the political savvy to address those challenges.  Blanchard and Homan didn't learn these skills in coach school.<br /><br />Readers who identify with the chapter topics will find helpful guidance.  But as a certified grinch, I believe the authors left out a key question: \\"What are the challenges that this type of coaching is uniquely suited to addressing? And what assumptions do mainstream coaches make about human behavior?\\"<br /><br />The authors write that coaching is \\"an art of the soul and coaches are artists of the soul.\\"  And the \\"goal of coaching is to help clients objectively see where they are .. and where they need to be ... and then develop a plan to get them there with as little effort and as much fun as the law will allow.\\"<br /><br />These definitions are appealing but vague.  I've seen many concepts of \\"soul.\\"  There are hundreds of ways to help people get from here to there.  In reality, I've found that mainstream coaches often assume their clients have the answers. They need help with confidence, accountability and \\"backward plans.\\"<br /><br />Blanchard and Homan are probably wise enough to avoid applying these techniques universally to any client who shows up on their doorstep. But they need to articulate their understanding to help readers choose their own coaches. Not everyone wants a cheerleader and some people actually function most effectively with what psychologists call \\"defensive pessimism.\\"<br /><br />So I think this book would be even more helpful with a section discussing not just what a coach might do, but when and why this type of coaching works. Every theory has limits of applicability; even gravity works only under certain atmospheric conditions. There's no universal solution for \\"everyone.\\"<br /><br />By making explicit the assumptions and limits of coaching, the authors would avoid some sources of confusion. For instance, they describe a client who felt she had to \\"come clean\\" with her coach about smoking. The coach responded, \\"I don't care if you smoke.\\"  Although coaching is supposed to be a partnership, this example suggests some kind of power imbalance. And indeed some coaches say openly, \\"I give my clients permission to...\\"  Permission implies power.<br /><br />As a minor glitch, the book jacket makes mention of a 25-item self-survey, but I found a 46-item \\"scrubdown.\\" Perhaps they can make a correction in the next edition.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're lucky to work with someone of the caliber of these authors, you'll probably benefit.  But it's up to you to decide if you're benefiting from their intelligence and business expertise or from application the coaching tools they present in their chapters.h fun as the law will allow.\\"    <br /> <br />These definitions are appealing but vague.

But the resemblance ends there. Rachel Alexander is a tough New York licensed PI, not an amateur. She lives alone, without a steady boyfriend, and has a loving but realistic relationship with her dog, a pit bull named Dashiell.<br /><br />Conant's Holly Winter is warm and fuzzy; Benjamin's Rachel Alexander is street-smart and tough. And while Holly Winter is unabashedly a dog fanatic, Rachel Alexander doesn't go into rhapsodies over Dashiell. He's a good dog. She's a good trainer. What else would you expect?  Or put another way, you don't have to like dogs to enjoy this mystery, while enjoyment Susan Conant's books will be deepened by dog ownership. I learned that first-hand!<br /><br />And as a result, Benjamin's plots tend to be edgier. Here Rachel discovers she has been named executor of a will for Timothy O'Fallon, a man she met briefly in a pet-therapy group. She agrees, suspecting that the dead man had a reason for asking her to do the job. And of course she's getting paid the customary executor's fee.<br /><br />Rachel learns Tim was a cop from a family with tragedies to rival the more famous Irish family, the Kennedys. She also begins to wonder if his death really was a suicide, especially since she discovers a note from a family member, \\"I saw what you did.\\"  A tragic event from Tim's childhood seems to be haunting him today.<br /><br />Up to the very last chapter, I was riveted by the characters, writing and plot. I loved Rachel's discussion of therapy dogs. I enjoyed her interactions with the off-beat Village people.  Her encounter with Detective Michael Brody seems headed for a longer romance.<br /><br />Experienced mystery readers will look for villains close to home. Trying not to spoil the plot, I'd have to say that Benjamin doesn't play by the usual detective rules of when to introduce the villain.  The climactic scene -- de rigeur for modern mysteries -- seems a little forced.<br /><br />If you like to go back and say, \\"Ah, I see where I could have guessed the ending,\\" you'll be disappointed. But if you want a fast-paced absorbing read,  and a chance to spend time in the Village with some interesting people and a delightful dog, this novel is for you. I awarded five stars because I wish I'd had this book on my last airplane ride!-- de rigeur for modern mysteries -- seems a little forced.   <br /> <br />If you like to go back and say, \\"Ah, I see where I could have guessed the ending,\\" you'll be disappointed.

US	43879637	R3BO5NOUC5YXFI	1400052904	456848605	Confidence: How Winning Streaks and Losing Streaks Begin and End	Books	5	34	44	N	N	Essential for understanding business and career change	The word \\"confidence\\" gets overused and abused among many personal and business coaches, so I was surprised to see Kanter's choice of title.  In a way, it's misleading, because Kanter focuses more broadly on how to capitalize on winning streaks and turn around losing streaks.  Confidence is only part of a leadership formula.<br /><br />Kanter chooses sports examples because they're clear-cut. Wins and losses are easy to identify.  However, the lessons from those case histories apply to a variety of business, organizational and personal situations.<br /><br />If you read carefully, she warns that turnarounds aren't easy. \\"Try not to lose twice in a row,\\" she warns. If you conclude there's no point in trying to win, there's trouble ahead. Signs of a losing streak include weak accountability, deteriorating relationships and disappearing initiative.  \\"The only good thing about losing is that it sounds an alarm bell,\\" she concludes.<br /><br />Once you realize you're on a losing streak, Kanter emphasizes, you need to build, not retreat. Stay calm, she says. Dig deeper. Work harder. Seek support, even when you feel like hiding. And most important, remember you can't \\"jump the processes.\\"  Use small steps to achieve big goals.  Everybody wants a quick fix and that's a surefire recipe for disaster.<br /><br />As a career consultant, I am often asked how to break individual losing streaks. Typically a client says something like, \\"I lost my job, got sick, had family crises, and had to move. And now I'm defeated.\\"  Or clients lose one job after another, fueled by discouragement.<br /><br />Kanter's book has to be translated to reach individuals. Her message seems to be, \\"Someone has to take charge.\\" In one moving example, a family rallied behind a teenager who was failing math. They bought him nice clothes to communicate, \\"You're worth it.\\"  The stigma of hiring a tutor was defused by making the tutor a member of \\"Team Robert.\\"  In another example, a woman's public humiliation was defused by her husband's strong encouragement.<br /><br />So if you lack an insightful manager or empathetic relatives, you may have to draw your own plan. Coaches and consultants may become your change managers.  I'm working on an article for my website on this very topic.<br /><br />Bottom line, though, this book clearly targets managers who are in a position to mastermind a turnaround.  I'd have liked to see more about the way individual employees or team members can handle themselves, regardless of the leader's capabilities. Should they leave a losing organization? Strengthen themselves and create their own goals?<br /><br />Kanter has always studied organizations at the macro level and it's not reasonable to ask her to address individuals now.  This book deserves attention for frank, unsparing focus on winners and losers, and for an understanding of the way organizations win and lose every day, all around us.ublic humiliation was defused by her husband's strong encouragement. <br /> <br />So if you lack an insightful manager or empathetic relatives, you may have to draw your own plan.

As a career consultant, I often find myself frustrated with mindless career advice. So it's a treat to open this book and find some truly original ideas that I can recommend to my clients and ezine readers.  And, amazingly, Morgenstern's book will be appropriate to a variety of readers and career stages. It's not just for entry-level beginners or senior vice presidents. We can all read and learn here.<br /><br />Happiness, says Morgenstern, means \\"liking what you're doing and being good at it, feeling connected, in control, successful and balanced.\\" Now there's a realistic definition that we can work with!<br /><br />I like Morgenstern's listing of nine competencies. Most are straightforward and you're heard some before, but they're presented insightfully. For instance, \\"organize at the speed of change\\" and develop an \\"entrepreneurial mindset\\" have become essential in today's world; you probably know you need to delegate and work well with others, but we can never hear this message too often.<br /><br />Perhaps the most striking insight is, \\"Sometimes it's not you! Sometimes it's them holding you back.\\" In working with live clients, I find that identifying this difference can be key to long-term career success, not to mention santiy.<br /><br />Other messages I support wholeheartedly: \\"Your personal life is an investment in your work.\\"<br /><br />\\"Try neglecting one small task.\\" (So true! Often nobody notices even when you neglect the big tasks!)<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"Own your career so you're not a victim.\\"<br /><br />Well said.<br /><br />This book's layout could be more visually appealing; it's not the author's fault, but the pages sometimes seem crowded.  However, it's worth digging.  I will be recommending this book on my ezine page and will encourage many of my clients to give themselves this book as a gift.	2004-09-28

I'm not surprised by the hostility of some reviewers. More than any other subject, psychology encourages us to believe, \\"Everyone's an expert!\\"  And anyone who dares to criticize any variation of Myers-Briggs tests will be seen as attacking motherhood and apple pie.  People don't give up illusions lightly.<br /><br />Among my own career change clients, I am often asked, \\"Do you have a test that will identify the perfect career for me?\\" Those who have paid -- often expensively -- for tests inevitably report disillusionment.<br /><br />Paul has thoroughly researched the origins and scientific quality of several tests that are commonly used to make serious decisions about people.  As she says, they're used by parole boards, HR departments, counselors and more. You can be denied custody of your children on the basis of a flawed test.  In science, flawed doesn't mean \\"better than nothing.\\" It means \\"useless.\\"<br /><br />Her criticism of the MBTI is right on.  Psychometric theory incorporates two ways to evaluate tests -- reliability and validity. Reliability means you'll get consistent results each time you take the test. Yet 47% of test-takers change types when they retake the MBTI. Validity means the test measures what it's supposed to measure, yet there are no objective ways to compare the sixteen types.<br /><br />And while some test-takers and reviewers claim people get great insights from their test results, Paul demolishes this response.  Over fifty years ago, a psychologist gave people a test. He then put together a combination of sentences taken from horoscopes and gave each test-taker the same \\"results.\\"  These people rated accuracy of these \\"results\\" an average 4.2 where 5 is highest -- and several scored the accuracy as a perfect 5!<br /><br />Her dissection of other tests is even scarier. Asked to describe an inkblot, a logical response would be, \\"It's an inkblot.\\"  Interpretation of the Rorschach is problematic. The MMPI was never intended for widespread usage and once again, there's more ideology than science.<br /><br />Paul explains the attraction of tests.  We want quick, easy answer. Myers-Briggs is positive -- something for everyone.<br /><br />She urges us to be careful when we're asked to take tests that have consequences for our lives, and I think she's right. There's enormous risk that our test results will be misinterpreted and/or misused. That's her real message.<br /><br />As for individuals, many stimuli can trigger insights.  Some are more evocative -- or just more fun -- than others.  You can use your horoscope, a hand of tarot cards, pictures from magazines, descriptions of the 16 MBTI profiles, want ads from a newspaper.  What's interesting will be the way you respond to these stimuli. It won't be scientific but if you find the exercise helpful, no harm done.<br /><br />Paul's message is that we're treating these tests or \\"assessments\\" as though they have scientific standing, which they do not.  We're making life-changing decisions based on these tests.  If you're an individual seeking help, some consultants will charge big bucks to help you analyze your test results.  Many college courses -- outside the psych department, she emphasizes -- actually incorporate these tests.<br /><br />Many people won't care if individuals and organizations invest resources and make decisions based on instruments that were prepared in an ad hoc fashion by untrained amateurs.  Those people will be furious with anyone who questions their beliefs. But for those who do care about the basis of choice and decision making, and who value the difference between science and pseudo-science, this book more than adequately fills the bill.for widespread usage and once again, there's more ideology than science. <br /> <br />Paul explains the attraction of tests.

Although she's a college graduate, she's been raised to be a good stay-at-home wife.<br /><br />Living with her in-laws, Priya finds herself stifled.  She spends hours helping with cooking and cieaning, and she's expected to be humble and respectful with her husband's parents.  Luckily Priya's mother-in-law encourages her to take a job. She lands a spot as receptionist to a top Hollywood news magazine.<br /><br />Continuing to be humble and polite beyond Hollywood standards, Priya befriends a coworker who teaches her how to dress. Unfortunately, she has to sneak to her gym to change clothes, because her mother-in-law forbids dressing western-style...except in some old clothes that are beyond vintage and retro.<br /><br />Because Priya says yes to everything, she gets asked to do all sorts of work for the reporters.

As a long-time fan of Rei Shimura, I welcomed the appearance of the Pearl Diver -- and I wasn't disappointed. Over the years, Massey has honed her craft and developed her heroine. As a result, Pearl Diver is a page turner with depth.<br /><br />As other reviewers have noted, Rae eagerly accepts a commission to design a new Japanese fusion restaurant in DC. She misses Japan and she really needs to work, so despite a contract (written with the help of her Scottish lawyer fiance, Hugh) she rushes into the job without qualifying her client carefully.<br /><br />Things start to go wrong when Rae's upscale cousin Kendall gets kidnapped right outside the restaurant -- hardly a way to attract customers. Then Andrea, the restaurant's chilly hostess, asks Rae to help find her long-missing Japanese mother.<br /><br />Meanwhile, on the home front, Hugh invites Rae's Aunt Norie to come for a visit.  \\"She can't find out we're living together,\\" says a horrified Rae, so the engaged couple play a ludicrous hide-and-seek game.<br /><br />As a writer, Massey has set herself a real challenge: to make the heroine realistic, which means she has flaws, but at the same time keep heroine so likeable that we care what happens to her.  To serious fans,  Rae's like an old friend we've known so long, we don't care.<br /><br />Over the series, Rae goes back and forth between being a strong, self-sufficient woman, and a girl who just can't say no.  In Bride's Kimono, she allowed a flight attendant to move her seat, thereby endangering her mission and ultimately herself. Here she gets sucked in to the mystery of a rather unlikeable coworker, risking her relationship with Hugh and ultimately her life and more.<br /><br />Frankly, I think Hugh is far more patient and understanding than most real life fiances.  He's right to challenge her choice of solving a mystery that's really none of her business, rather than spending more time with him.<br /><br />And if Rae really wants to be independent, she needs to build her business aggressively, not waste time haring after missing persons and soothing a client she should have turned down in the first place.  But that's my business consultant persona coming through!<br /><br />There's one intimate scene in the book (to put it delicately) where Hugh does show frustration in a way that's a little disturbing and out of character.  I'm hardly an expert, but I'd encourage Rae to dig a little deeper into Hugh's past before she ties the knot, so to speak.<br /><br />I loved Rae's disapproval of the modern Washington dress code. It seems like \\"dressing up\\" has gone the way of the dinosaur, and some of us couldn't be happier!<br /><br />And I do have one rather strong quibble about this book. Rae's Aunt Norie is presented as old.  She takes naps. She's too old-fashioned to accept Rae's living arrangements. In one scene, Rae regrets exposing these \\"older\\" people to danger.<br /><br />But we learn Aunt Norie is in her early fifties! That's young enough to run all over Washington without naps.<br /><br />In summary, Sujata Massey remains at the top of her form and I hope she continues to write more Rae Shimura mysteries, whether based in Tokyo, California, or DC.<br /><br />A final scary thought. In an earlier review, I noted that several mystery heroines are not only engaged, but actually on the brink of matrimony!

The pilot was killed by a sniper. Was the bullet meant for Randy, the new husband? Or for Pauly herself, whose fear of heights kept her firmly on the ground? And did Pauly just imagine she saw a little boy running away from the balloon, wearing nothing but her dead husbands jacket?<br /><br />The plot twists and turns on every page as Pauly keeps learning more about her dead husband. Why didn't he tell her about his vasectomy? What are those mysterious papers in his bank safe? What's real and what isn't? Who's on her side and who's against her? And why?<br /><br />Amazingly, author Slater manages to come up with a consistent explanation. She treads a fine line between legitimate red herrngs that distract the reader and sleight of hand that leads the reader to cry, \\"Foul!\\"<br /><br />This mystery is plot-driven with a heroine who's likeable but not strong enough to carry a series. As she says herself, Pauly held only a few nondescript jobs before marrying the ill-fated Randy. She had been a technical writer but doesn't use this background to solve the mystery.  In all fairness, her dead husband's partners are right to question her involvement in their business. All she has going for her is a fierce determination to find out who she really married -- and why he wanted to marry so badly.<br /><br />But while you're reading, if you're like me, you won't notice the absence of character development. You'll be too busy turning the pages to find out whodunit and why.  And you won't be a bit surprised by the romantic subplot.	2004-09-04

Lisa Halaby was conscious of her Arab roots before she met and married King Hussein. She'd spent considerable time in the Middle East, including Iran.  Her father had been an aviation leader, most notably as president of the once-proud Pan American Airlines, and she'd traveled all over the world.  So she wasn't a naive white-bread American blown away by exotic lands. She was a smart, well-traveled, deliberately unfashionable twenty-something who fell in love with her eyes wide open.<br /><br />And Lisa was uniquely prepared for her queenly role. Private schools and Princeton gave her poise and polish that she probably didn't realize she had. The Halaby parents were at home with wealth and royalty.  Even Lisa's Princeton major -- architecture and planning -- gave her unique skills to contribute both to the marriage and to her new country.<br /><br />The book jacket calls Leap of Faith a love story. To be sure, Queen Noor adored her husband, as, apparently, did most of the country. But her love was clear-eyed. She mentions frustrations and times of anger and despair, enough to communicate the stresses of the marriage. Like all step-parents, she faced resistance from her husband's children from former marriages.<br /><br />But Noor doesn't descend into self-pity or dwell on her own personal problems.  Instead, she turns outward, to the social and political challenges of Jordan. She had a front row seat during several Middle East conflicts and she shares her unapologetic partisan views.<br /><br />Noor makes a strong case for a view that remains unpopular in the United States. Israel was created to solve a European problem: how to compensate for atrocities and give Jews a homeland.  To make room for this country, Noor argues, those already living on the land were forced to move.  And, she claims, Israel wasn't satisfied with the original allotment, but rather went to war to gain more territory.  When the Iron Curtain came down, Israel's population swelled, creating havoc throughout the region.<br /><br />Is her perspective accurate? That's a question for scholars and experts -- and they don't all agree either. But I believe Americans need to realize how we are seen by other nations. Apart from the Arab-Israeli conflict, Noor expresses astonishment at the American ability to be distracted by human interest stories while the world teeters on the brink of disaster. Anyone who's talked to European, Middle Eastern or Asian citizens probably has heard similar views.<br /><br />True, Noor does refer to a lot of famous people as \\"dear friends,\\" but that's standard practice in celebrity autobiography. And she's careful to refer to King Hussein as \\"my husband\\" or \\"Hussein\\" or even \\"King Hussein\\" throughout the book.  He appears to have been a remarkable man. Interestingly, Noor completely omits any mention of the age difference, perhaps because the cultural gap was so wide.  I'd have liked to see more photos, but understandably Noor seems determined to avoid anything that creates an appearance of commercialism.<br /><br />Many readers will find Noor somewhat chilly -- somewhere along the way she picked up a British reserve -- and many will disagree. But it's hard to come away without getting involved, even shaken. Thought-provoking, intelligent and, in the end, fascinating.gain more territory.

As a longtime Grafton fan, I too was disappointed. Kinsey seems tired and her author does too.  Grafton set herself a tough challenge: keep Kinsey Milhone firmly in the 1980s. So there's little scope for the character's development and growth.  In her eighteenth mystery, she's still living in a converted porch, driving a VW bug, solving crimes in southern California, eating at Rosie's and making no progress in the romance department.<br /><br />Asked to babysit wealthy wayward Reba Lafferty, Kinsey meets the young woman outside the prison gates. She escorts Reba to her parole officer and to the motor vehicle department. They go shopping.  Then Kinsey realizes Reba is somehow involved with the man whose company she allegedly embezzled.<br /><br />Well, any reader of mystery and true crime can guess why.  Grafton brings in the heavy ammunition: government officials, including Cheney a local cop who's inherited wealth allows him to live very comfortably. Kinsey and Cheney might become an item...but, I found myself wondering, who cares?<br /><br />Actually I grew tired of watching Kinsey Milhone follow Reba around. Reba's a loser, the kind of woman who falls for the wrong kind of man.  I didn't find her at all sympathetic, although I enjoyed the scene where she helps Kinsey buy some becoming clothes.  But I couldn't help wondering why Kinsey spends time with her.  Then again, Kinsey's only friends seem to be her aging landlord, Henry, and his aging sibilngs.  Henry's hypochondriac brother and belated romance seem...well, tired.<br /><br />I know Grafton's committed to finishing the alphabet and this effort would please many of her fans. But maybe it's time for her to take a break. Kinsey's world seems claustrophobic and, as Reba says early in the book, dull.  I'd like to see a new heroine...but more important, I'd like Kinsey to develop as a character, to learn from experience, and move on.<br /><br />Then again, every author's entitled to an occasional misstep. Most of A-Q were really good.  When S comes out, I'll be on the waiting list, ever hopeful.misstep. Most of A-Q were really good.

Nevada Barr's Anna Pigeon, Marcia Muller's Sharon McCone and now Margaret Maron's Deborah Knott all are strong women headed for the altar. We've had some great wedding scenes -- Susan Wittig Albert married off China Bayles in a cascade of lavender and Susan Conant created a dog-loving wedding for Holly Winter.  Let's see if these three can live up to their predecessors.<br /><br />I'm rooting for Deborah Knott.  In High Country Fall, Knott finds herself caught up in a puzzling case while she substitutes for a judge in a small High Country town. Hearing a murder case, Deborah finds probable cause to bind the young suspect, but she doesn't believe he's guilty. A second murder confirms her hunch: the method is similar and this time the suspect has a tight alibi.<br /><br />The solution to the murders hinges on a twist of partnership agreements that Deborah knows from her own experience. As other reviewers noted, the author plays fair: we could have followed a trail of clues, but they're not really obvious.  We're also provided with a clever and amusing subplot involving Deborah's twin cousins.<br /><br />This mystery is about as cozy as they come. There's not much suspense. Author Maron takes liberties available to authors writing their tenth mystery: The climactic suspense episode is not related to the main mystery, although Deborah emerges with the clues neatly arranged in her own mind.<br /><br />As a small-town dweller (and we *do* have a Wal-Mart), I am amazed at mystery heroines who manage to find not only great men -- good-looking, smart and sensitive -- but also great restaurants with perfectly mixed drinks.  It makes for good reading but, alas, also a bit of skepticism on the part of some of us readers.<br /><br />I suspect most readers will read High Country Fall not for plot but for a chance to spend time with Deborah Knott. She's brilliantly drawn, a combination of southern upbringing and contemporary lifestyle.  She's totally unpretentious and down-to-earth. And she's got that wonderful family all over the state, flawed but fascinating and always ready to help one another. Deborah's smart without being intellectual. She has a rich exterior life and an astute social sense.  And she's strong.<br /><br />Can she and Dwight live happily ever after?

Women write many of these books because, for a long time, the novelty of being female in those occupations would get the book published.<br /><br />We've seen many books by women doctors, including Perri Klass, Frances Conley and Elizabeth Morgan. So what's remarkable in this book is the complete absence of any references to gender and gender issues. One older woman says she'd rather have a woman doctor and the author says sure, she would too. Big deal. Transue writes about \\"the neurology resident\\" and then uses \\"he\\" or \\"she\\" with no comment. Both male and female attendings -- senior physicians -- can be heroic or deficient.<br /><br />Almost as surprising, Transue portrays herself as polite and caring. I must admit I've stayed far from doctors and hospitals throughout my life, but the few I've met were nothing like Transue. She actually apologizes for bothering people. In fact, I suspect she set a world record for a doctor saying, \\"I'm sorry.\\"<br /><br />Most doctors I've met were arrogant, even rude, but Transue doesn't report a single instance of arrogance. An attending is \\"distant\\" and another unsure of herself. But when a patient's relative demands to speak to an attending, and orders Transue to make the call, she complies.<br /><br />On Call deserves five stars because it's well written, almost a page-turner. Transue manages to make a collection of essays hold our interest, even when we rarely learn the ending. For instance, we learn that a man has been estranged from his family, but never why.<br /><br />Most chapters are based on actual patient encounters. Transue helps us understand what's going on but doesn't get bogged down in the (literally) gory details. She describes her own fatigue without whining or pity. She doesn't seem to wonder if things could be changed.<br /><br />And, in what appears to be a teaching hospital, there's little concern with changes in medicine and managed care. In one scene a patient must decide if he'll pay for a no-smoking patch or wait six weeks to begin a no-smoking campaign. Isn't there an irony here worth noting?<br /><br />This non-judgmental style is both the strength and the weakness of On Call. Transue examines her own experience with, well, clinical detachment. She marvels that she could break down crying one day and be a model resident the next. She doesn't share details of her life, so we don't know what gave her the strength to keep her perspective. She went sailing with friends; she baked a blackberry pie; she lifted weights with another resident who became a gym buddy. She alludes to a loyal and loving family and she had a superb education.<br /><br />But we don't know where she lived during residency or what sustained her during the tough times. Perhaps the combination of these factors helped her become such a successful resident.<br /><br />As a career consultant who has studied life transitions, I was fascinated by her final chapter: a realization that the major changes in our lives often are not marked by ceremony. Going from residency to medicine was more important than graduating from medical, but marked only by a brunch and a certificate.<br /><br />Transue concludes she's grateful for those years but wouldn't ever want t do it again. Paying dues is always hard but usually worth the effort. Transue was lucky to pay hers when she was very young and to end with something that was worth the price.ching hospital, there's little concern with changes in medicine and managed care.

She remembers events that took place nearly a hundred years ago, imagining herself as a woman named Annie Evans. Reincarnation? False memories? But how does she get the data to create false memories? She's been tested by psychologists and found sane.<br /><br />Simon discovers Annie Evans existed after all. She worked in an orphanage that's long gone, but there's ample evidence to corroborate her story.  Together with Helen, he tracks down friends and relatives who remembered Annie. And working from careful observation, he solves the dual mystery of what happened to Annie and how Helen got caught up in Annie's memories.<br /><br />The story held my interest to the end, with charming details of Simon Shaw's comfortable bachelor life, the North Carolina culture and forays into history.  I would have liked an author's note to tell us what she researched: what's plausible about the ending, how realistic the historical touches are, and more.  Yet for a cozy, this type of neat ending seems just right.	2004-08-23

There's the Sheriff Brady Series, the JP Beaumont series and now the Brandon Walker series.  Readers seem to prefer one or two, and I'm a strongo Joanna Brady fan.  Day of the Dead isn't even the same genre, much less style.<br /><br />The book opens with a young girl's horrific story. Wrenched from a quasi-detention home in Mexico, the young girl thinks she's moving to a new lfie with adopted parents, where she can go to school. She wakes up to find herself imprisoned by people she had every reason to trust, tortured by unwanted sex, with no escape but death.<br /><br />As other reviewers note, this novel is really suspense rather than mystery. We learn the identity of the evil Stryker couple, and we watch them spreading evil till the very end. The crimes are so ghastly (like some of Lawrence Block's grisly details in the Matt Scudder series), and the innocence such a contrast, that I wonder if Jance was trying to send a strong message.<br /><br />Perhaps we're supposed to see a vivid example of a wealthy, pillar-of-the-community couple who can literally get away with murder. We can contrast their protected status with the vulnerable orphans they destroy and even the wife's lover, who comes to a tragic end after being framed for a murder.<br /><br />We get fascinating glimpses into native culture, reminiscent less of Hillerman than of James Doss.  Walker's adopted daughter, determined to become a medicine woman, emerges as the most human and likeable character in the book.  More distracting were the series of flashbacks that interrupted the forward flow of the suspense.  The story of Brenda, a Native American lawyer who gets drawn back to the reservation, seemed especially irrelevant, although the character was likeable.<br /><br />Jance is too skilled a storyteller to lose the reader and I admire any well-published author who goes out on a limb with a new technique.  I can understand why an author might need to diversity her writing. Experienced authors must create new challenges for themselves or risk losing their edge.  But as a reader, I can't help wishing she'd opted for another Joanna Brady instead.or might need to diversity her writing.

The book would be worth reading just to gain a sense of day-to-day Peace Corps life, when exotic gets overwhelmed by mundane.<br /><br />But what fascinates Weiss is the old story of justice denied. A smart but geeky volunteer murders a beautiful girl. Everyone knows he's the killer.<br /><br />But ironically, as Weiss points out, Deb the victim was always a private person who hadn't made close friends. Dennis, her killer, had a circle of close friends who supported him through pre-trial confinement and trial, even bringing him food and gifts.<br /><br />And ironically the Peace Corps wanted to save its reputation. In defiance of the Agency's own rules, bureaucrats descended from Washington and a top-flight lawyer was hired to defend Dennis.  Dennis was ultimately released to the US with a promise of long-term confinement in a mental institution. However, through legal loopholes, Dennis was allowed to go free. He ended up working for another US government agency, the Social Security Administration, in computers.<br /><br />As in many true crime stories, there's some ambivalence about assigning blame. True, Dennis is a murderer. But he was doing everything but wearing a sign saying, \\"Danger! Get this man out of here!\\" He didn't like Tonga and didn't fit. His colleague had tried to report concerns to the Peace Corps country director, only to be turned away.<br /><br />And this Director was hardly blameless. A political appointee, Mary had been an executive secretary and modeling agency director.  She lacked management skills and cultural awareness.  She created tension and resentment among volunteers, including both the inept Dennis and the competent Deborah.<br /><br />Ultimately the story is about what happens when people feel they've hit bottom, as Dennis would. Denied a re-enlistment and spurned by Deb, he fell deeper into his own darkness. He was unable to feel and return the friendship that others generously extended. An Australian family allows him to use their washing machine each week; he cuts off the wife's hair while she's sleeping.<br /><br />From all accounts, Dennis suffered a situational descent into paranoia.  By Tongan justice, he should have been locked up for life.<br /><br />Recent op-ed articles have raised questions about the function of imprisonment, and Weiss inadvertently presents the case against harsh sentences.  Dennis never harmed anyone else, as far as we know, and went on to serve society as a useful citizen.  Ironically, American Taboo offers a natural experiment: What happens when a murderer goes free?<br /><br />In summary, American Taboo is a great page-turner, as gripping as any mystery or adventure novel. It's hard to put down. Yes, it's a bit long, and there are too many details, especially with regard to the trial. But in the end, the details are necessary to make the exotic setting seem real.

The heroine herself is a period piece, dressing in vintage clothing and balancing family obligations, crime-solving and deadlines.<br /><br />Kandel sometimes slows down the action a little too much as she describes characters and sets scenes.  I found myself skipping over some paragraphs.  I wanted to say, \\"Let's get on with it,\\" but I didn't want to put the book down and I genuinely cared how the ending would turn out.  Along the way it was fun to read about Erle Stanley Gardner, and I might go back and read a few of his books.<br /><br />Kandel, through her heroine, encourages us to think of Gardner's themes, such as the role of women in Gardner's books. Perry Mason attracted beautiful female clients. He had a magnificent super-secretary Della Street, who sometimes played a role in crime-solving herself. And I absolutely adored the economy-size Bertha Cool, created in an era when thin was the only way to be.  In future volumes, I hope Kandel gives us more of this kind of background.<br /><br />This book definitely deserves to be higher-ranking on amazon and I hope the publishers take heed! This is an author who could move to best-seller status, given the opportunity.	2004-08-09

Unlike Kinsey Milhone, the other PD from California, Sharon McCone continues to grow and Muller's mysteries resonate with contemporary events. This novel couldn't have been written five years ago -- maybe not even three years ago! Everyone has a cell phone, the agency relies on Internet technology, and Sharon's lover periodically gets drafted to help the war on terrorism.<br /><br />Sharon McCone and her crew have been celebrating her agency's success -- and then everything goes wrong. Her cat gets diabetes.  Her latest hire, a reformed juvenile delinquent, gets arrested for credit card fraud -- right in Sharon's own office. Since she's accused of defrauding a client, the state threatens Sharon's own license and the very existence of Sharon's thriving agency.<br /><br />Naturally, Sharon prioritizes her own survival.  It doesn't take her long to discover who's behind the elaborate plot to discredit her. In fact, we learn who's pulling strings about 2/3 of the way through the book, and the rest of the novel is about finding the culprit and seeking justice...well, the last couple of pages are a little personal!<br /><br />I found the novel suspenseful, even scary, because danger comes close to Sharon's home.  I enjoyed spending time with the characters Muller has created over the years and watching Sharon McCone solve the crime.  But some readers might wish there were more of a plot twist in the last part of the book.<br /><br />Like most of Muller's novels, Dangerous Hour is not a classic detective story. We don't get access to clues and we watch McCone solve the crime, with help from others. We aren't invited to participate. However, experienced mystery readers will pick up clues that McCone shouldn't trust a character who turns out to be connected to the criminal.<br /><br />And the only false note comes from Sharon's failure to run deep background checks on everyone she deals with -- certainly everyone she invites into her office.  After all, she *is* running a detective agency!  We readers should get a sense that she's doing for herself what she'd encourage others to do.<br /><br />Overall, I like the grown-up Sharon. She's tracked down her birth family and integrated them into her life. As other reviewers noted, there's nothing cutesy here, even when she's caring for her cats.  She's found a potential life partner who respects what she does, and they give each other space for the adventure they need.<br /><br />Often mystery heroines lose their edge when they get involved in a relationship.  I suspect Muller won't let this happen, even if Sharon and Hy end up married.s* running a detective agency!

Author Boyle interviewed twelve women who were determined to follow their dream, as we are so often advised to do. They didn't win lotteries or buy themselves new careers. They made choices, worked hard and won.<br /><br /> Perhaps most famous is the 70-year-old Mesa AIrlines flight attendant, who's been profiled in AARP magazine. She'd always wanted to fly and now that weight and vision restrictions are relaxed, she's up there having a ball. She began with a position as a gate agent, using those contacts to reach her ultimate goal.<br /><br /> Ironically, another woman had been a flight attendant, but realized she couldn't complete her college degree while flying. One person's dream is another's past life.<br /><br /> Rejected from the Peace Corps in her twenties, another woman finally made it to Eastern Europe as a business consultant. She describes in (literally) wrenching detail her struggle to meet the Peace corps health requirements, going so far as to have three healthy teeth pulled.<br /><br /> Academic dreams ranged from law school to a Seven Sisters college. They may have had to apply more than once, but once there, they excelled and rejoiced.<br /><br /> Twelve diverse dreams, all achieved by persistence, determination and sacrifice. They knew exactly what they wanted and remained focused. And they're all winners.<br /><br /> Author Boyle intersperses the stories with her own journal of writing the book. Rejected by fourteen publishers, she and her agent persisted. As a writer myself, I find these reports a little too close to home, but I'm very glad she persisted. And as a career consultant, I suggest that these women will be role models to those who can cling to a dream.<br /><br /> However, we shouldn't be too quick to say, &quot;If they can do it, anyone can!&quot; Women who find themselves adrift, whether through layoffs or their own internal shifts, rarely have a sense of what they want to do. Dreams can't be created in a workshop or even several months of coaching. They have a life of their own.<br /><br /> And women who have enjoyed successful careers often want to keep going rather than find new adventure or meaning. They aren't necessarily ready for sacrifice, yet when a job goes away and you're over-fifty, the system offers little help.<br /><br /> However, Defying Gravity does suggest a new way to think about the rest of a life: Soar to a dream. Reframe your next move as a great adventure. And, if you really want adventure, go for it!nternal shifts, rarely have a sense of what they want to do.

Soon we meet the grown-up Laura, who's got a near-perfect little family and a satisfying, profitable quilt-making business.  Like Laura, the tone of the book is cozy and domestic.<br />Just before returning to her parents' home for a family reunion, Laura gets a call from her sister Caroline, requesting a private meeting with Laura and their brother Steve.  Caroline's always had a flair for the dramatic, so nobody takes her seriously. But Caroline's sense of family duty kicks in. She's determined to help her sister fight whatever demons showed up this time.<br />We know we're about to learn a story of some kind of family abuse, and sure enough, we do.  But it's not the typical story of a male abusing a female while a mother looks the other way. Instead, there's some complexity, based on family history. And to her credit, Berg gives us a realistic, plausible ending, risking the frustration of her readers.<br />I have to agree with other reviewers. The characters aren't deeply drawn. We learn a lot about Laura's husband, yet the family seems as stereotyped as characters in a television show.  Siblings Steve and Caroline seem shadowy and Maggie, Laura's best friend, does seem to be the one-size-fits-all female buddy.  Laura's marriage to Pete seems realistic: she tolerates some idiosyncrasies yet they're firmly a team.  And the discovery of childhood secrets has been used far too many times as a plot device.<br />Still, Berg is a thoroughly professional writer. She moves the action swiftly and her prose style is flawless and spare.  So bottom line, it's a good fast read, if you don't want to spend time analyzing the characters.  And I could see a book club discussing, &quot;Could this have happened? How realistic was the ending? Is Laura's family too good to be true?&quot;<br />Not having a family myself (unless you count the dog and two cats), I'd have to look elsewhere for answers.ts), I'd have to look elsewhere for answers.	2004-07-15

Spencer-Fleming has created a masterful, multi-layered mystery, not scary but suspenseful.<br />Episcopal priest Clare Fergusson leads her congregation through the beginning of Lent. Her parish faces financial calamity as the roof needs to be replaced and (by one vote) the vestry agrees to maintain the historical architecture of the building, rather than opt for a cheaper, modern solution.<br />Board member Lacey Marshall suggests donating her trust fund to the church, although this move will take funds from the Ketchem clinic her mother founded. And right after Al Rouse, resident physician, learns the money will be taken away, he disappears. Clare finds herself drawn into the search when Police Chief Russ Van Alstyne investigates a woman she's been counseling.<br />Not that Clare's an unwilling participant. A former Army chopper pilot, she enjoys a taste of adventure. She draws on her military skills of tracking and map reading. And she's very good friends with the married Chief, a source of scandal to many in the community.<br />Author Spencer-Fleming interrupts the contemporary story to give us glimpses into the Ketchem family in the 20's, 30's and 40's. We learn about the tragic deaths of Lacey Marshall's siblings, but it's not till the end of the book that we learn the full story. We discover a spooky parallel between the contemporary doctor's disappearance and the historical disappearance of Lacey's father, who simply vanished one night. Eventually we learn where the Ketchem fortune came from and why it's referred to as blood money.<br />Spencer-Fleming's history, like Sharyn McCrumb's, shows us how life really was lived in a specific US region. We go beyond the glamorized &quot;good old days,&quot; realizing the cruelty of the Prohibition laws (not unlike our modern drug laws in some ways) and the suffering of families during epidemics that we no longer comprehend.<br />I couldn't put this book down. The characters are three-dimensional and very realistic. In particular, Clare's friendship with Russ Van Alstyne resembles friendships I've had with single and married men, where the mind-to-mind component was stronger than any other bond. We're meant to realize that men and women can be friends while remaining faithful to their romantic partners.<br />The Episcopal priests I've met have been like Clare: smart and down-to-earth, not especially holy, let alone holier-than-thou.<br />Out of the Deep reminds me not of cozies, but of the lyrical mysteries of Sharyn McCrumb and Nevada Barr, filled with history, geography and complex relationships. Clare belongs to the genre of strong, tough women in nontraditional jobs. And Russ fits the genre of complex small town law enforcement officers, not unlike the sheriff that Anna Pigeon will be marrying, hopefully, in the next Nevada Barr.<br />Mysteries like these don't get written in a hurry, and I'm already eagerly awaiting Spencer-Fleming's next. --In particular, Clare's friendship with Russ Van Alstyne resembles friendships I've had with single and married men, where the mind-to-mind component was stronger than any other bond.

So if you've read Nanny Diaries and Devil Wears Prada, you'll have a strong sense of deja vue.<br />Although both these other books were better written and more tightly plotted (i.e., no loose ends like the disappearing therapist and no look-alike glamour men who hit on the heroine), Second Assistant deserves to be read. Here the Devil isn't a person but an entire industry. Naylor and Hare give us an inside view of life in Hollywood, from the bottom up.<br />The heroine (improbably nicknamed &quot;Lizzie&quot;) takes a second assistant job when her Washington political world falls apart. To her own surprise, she finds herself caught up in Hollywood, enjoying the life and hoping for more. She befriends a neighbor and a few equally oppressed underlings as well as the nice guy from the coffee shop, who turns out to be more Hollywood than she ever expected.<br />I gave Second Assistant three stars because I kept turning the pages. I liked the heroine's openness and admired her ability to cope with all sorts of bizarre situations without losing her dignity. And I'm amazed that she'd say yes to all sorts of requests, even from the boss's wife, but I guess that's why I never would have succeeded as a Second Assistant.<br />The saddest and truest lesson of this book. For some people, especially young attractive women, college degrees and raw intelligence will be less important than willingness to tolerate high frustration levels and creativity in carrying out a list of tasks that, at times, resembles a scavenger hunt rather than a business project.	2004-07-11

Okay, I admit it: I'll pick up almost any book with the word &quot;cat&quot; or &quot;dog&quot; on the cover.  I'd never read Geneen Roth before, and I didn't expect to like this book very much. But this book won me over the way Blanche won over the author: slowly and subtly.<br />Roth was in a position to be a great cat-owner. She lived in a city with access to alternative veterinary medicine as well as cat therapists, groomers and more.  So when Blanche entered her life, Roth's love spilled over.  And it couldn't happen to a nicer cat.<br />I must admit I turned the pages a little faster when Roth panicked about losing her cat.  Blanche is tougher than he looks, I wanted to say.<br />Many people will find parallels with Roth's family in their own lives -- or their friends' lives.  Roth tells the story movingly, but matter-of-factly, without self-pity.<br />But Blanche remains the hero of this book and Roth's life.  Perhaps the most telling passage comes when she writes that, &quot;Blanche is like food once was -- he doesn't talk back, he doesn't hit, he doesn't go away...also, and I think this is important, he doesn't have any calories.&quot;<br />Blanche really does fill a hole in the author's heart but, unlike food, Blanche helps Roth grow and accept new relationships.  Roth acquires not only a husband but also a dog.  And she takes on a spiritual teacher, distinguished from a therapist in one of the best sections of the book.  A therapist, says Roth, helps you heal the damage from what was done to you. A teacher helps you heal from the way you reacted to what was done to you.<br />The perfect gift for a  sensitive cat lover. Then again, what true cat person isn't sensitive?	2004-07-06

Retained to investigate property appropriation of long-ago internment camp veteran Amadeo Bandolini, Mary DiNunzio finds herself caught up in the story of a young man who apparently committed suicide over sixty years ago.  Ordered out of town, Mary visits the site of the camp in Missoula, Montana, and becomes convinced Amadeo didn't commit suicide. He was murdered. And, in the present, the lawyer for Amadeo's son's estate is also murdered.<br />Mary soon learns the identity of the murderer, although she hasn't a shred of proof.  And there's no motive.<br />But in the style we've come to expect from Scottoline, Mary can't just leave matters to the police. She undertakes a spot of breaking-and-entering, faces down a very wealthy and powerful adversary, falls into a trap that gets her locked into a car trunk, and a whole lot more.  Meanwhile, she's dodging a series of blind dates from nice-enough guys who don't stand a chance with the ghost of her dead husband, Mike.  Her aging parents confront health challenges.  And she matches wits with Judy Carrier, her all-time best friend.<br />The joy of this book comes from Scottoline's powerful plotting and sense of drama. Seemingly small throwaways -- like the curvey letters on the doors of Italian households on Mercer Street -- turn out to be relevant.  Mary's blind dates turn the plot wheel a little faster.<br />Mary is the deepest and most sympathetic of Scottoline's characters -- possibly her alter ego, as she's hinted in interviews. We see Judy Carrier through Mary's eyes, even when Carrier takes stage center.  Benny Rosato remains a distant matriarchal power figure. This time, Scottoline wisely turns the story over to Mary, complete with Mary's sardonic humor that she doesn't dare say aloud.  Some of these scenes -- e.g., when Mary compares a going-nowhere conversation to a high school French lesson -- are simply brilliant.  Only a pro could pull it off.<br />And only a special author could keep the suspense going as Mary pages back through dusty archives.  The ending is plausible and fun, though just a tad coincidental.  But if you make it that far, you won't care.<br />Lisa Scottoline could be a model for wannabe mystery writers. Then again, maybe she shouldn't.  She makes it look easy but it's incredibly hard.  I can't wait for the next volume in the series...<br />Just one question for Lisa: When will Judy and Mary make partner in the Rosato firm?

Being well into what Trafford calls \\"my time\\" -- the time when family obligations slow down and we get time for ourselves -- I was eager to gain insights from this book.  As a career coach, I work with men and women who have moved to \\"my time\\" or realize they're close.<br />Unfortunately, I couldn't recognize myself (or my clients) in this book, and I couldn't figure out what My Time was trying to do.  Trafford is a journalist, not a counselor or career coach, and she has conducted what appear to be dozens of interviews with people at midlife.  Unlike Po Bronson, who explored career change through interviews, she shows only happy, optimistic people who make few mistakes and experience even fewer financial woes.<br />My Time can't be viewed as journalism.  Trafford adds words of wisdom -- not especially profound and not new to anyone who's been reading the self-help genre or surfing the web.  For example, on page 38, she writes, \\"You look for potential in the daisy by your doorstep,\\" rather than reaching for the more distant North Star.  Compare this advice to what's contained in a better book, Finding Your Own North Star.  Martha Beck describes a 55-year-old who starts a business after losing his job and retirement. In just a few sentences, Beck sketches a much more realistic, hopeful story.<br />So my biggest complaint: About Time straddles between self-help and light journalism, yet fails to fit either category.  We get snippets of generalization -- e.g., dreaming helps us focus and we need to have plans -- but no tips for implementation.<br />My second grinchy comment: About Time trades on generalizations. In the fifties, we have increased medical bills. Older adults handle stress better. We have greater wisdom. We want to find meaning.  These beliefs are comforting but not accurate.<br />I know lots of people who still enjoy the edge that comes with making real money.  Meaning? They'll donate to charity -- and frankly, they're not good at doing warm-and-fuzzy.<br />Wisdom?  When you're thrust into a new life, you start over. Often skills and knowledge that served you in the corporate world become irrelevant -- even harmful -- during a life transition.  Any real estate agent meets midlife retirees who decide to move to the country, only to find themselves isolated and miserable. They lose money as they sell their retirement homes and move back to where they belong.<br />Generalizations are especially dangerous when writing about midlife, because people in the 50-to-80 age range are so diverse.  We are what we've lived.  In a big city gym, I once observed a group of fifty-plus exercisers, walking slowly around in a circle.  In the next room, members in the same age group were training to run a marathon.<br />At fifty, you may be fully employed at the peak of your career. Or you may be newly laid-off, forced to discover a new path, possibly with no retirement savings. You may be ready for a career change.  I've met 45-year-olds entering college and others who trained for careers as truck drivers and flight attendants.  In their fifties, they'll be newbies.<br />That's why the comparison with adolescence fails.  In the US, nearly every fourteen-year-old is in 9th grade. A few are in 8th or 10th.  But legally they're all in school, with a few home-schooled, and they're getting ready for high school.<br />A ten-year or twenty-year stint will pay huge dividends. At fifty, a ten-year-stint will have limited payback time.<br />Finally, this book is relentlessly cheerful. In a poignant interview, \\"Nancy\\" reports dealing with ageism when she applies for a challenging, full-time \\"real\\" job.  She freelances and consults.  She's learning to reinvent herself, chirps the commentary.<br />But we're missing a key point. If we have thirty years ahead of us, we have time for another career. Society's infrastructure and business culture have not caught up with this reality. There's still a stigma to starting over in many professions and oftenthe doors are closed. Free lance work and volunteering do not compensate for the loss.  For some of us, the daisy on the doorstep will be a reminder that we're missing our full-blown rose garden -- or our daily treks to the steamy jungle!<br />I wanted to be positive until I came to the end of the book, where the author rejoices in how \\"good,\\" \\"strong\\" and \\"generous\\" people are.  Anyone who agrees to invest in a journalistic interview will come across as good and generous.<br />Strong? Trafford says, \\"[F]or the most part, they repaired or renewed after loss...\\"  What does \\"most part\\" mean? For that matter, what does \\"repaired or renewed\\" mean?  What's the difference between the \\"most part\\" and the \\"least part?\\"<br />I didn't see examples of people who were tossed out of the corporate world in their mid-fifties, with limited options in their own industry. I didn't see examples of people who lacked insurance to get the kind of health care these interviewees took for granted. Nor did I see examples of lonely people who had to make new friends after losing a profession or spouse.<br />Midlife can be fun and rewarding but it's not easy.

She's not afraid to talk tough and to season her wisdom with humor.<br />I love her opening. Cats live in the moment, she says, and goes on to compare the relative advantages of being a cat versus being a human. But then, she concludes, it doesn't matter: if you're reading  this book, it's safe to say you're not a cat.<br />And unlike many authors, Lerner offers a balance between relationship and work stresses.  She describes a powerful but controversial intervention she designed for a young man who feared social rejection. While she reminds us she took into account the young man's non-threatening persona, I'm still amazed he didn't get arrested.  The point, however, is well-taken.  Action, not insight, creates change.<br />I especially appreciate Lerner's advice: &quot;Be able to live without your job.&quot; She's right: being free to walk allows you to speak up for your values. And although she doesn't make this point, I've found that when we're free to leave, we usually end up neither having to leave nor wanting to go.<br />And, adds Lerner, remember that the workplace is not your family. Organizations exist to ensure their own economic vitality -- i.e, their own survival.  &quot;Your work family may treat you in such an insensitive and uncaring manner that it will take your breath away.&quot; SO true.<br />Dealing with emotion, Lerner is more realistic than most authors. Recognizing unhappiness requires courage, yet unhappiness itself can help us become brave enough to make changes.  Anger and suffering can become part of who we are, so letting go leads to a feeling of homesickness.<br />All in all, a superb addition to the self-help shelf. Recommended to all.	2004-06-14

Someone sent me this book and it sat on the shelf for several weeks, while I thought, &quot;Not really my kind of book.&quot;  The cover is deceptive and it would be hard to come up with a more banal or less descriptive title.  The cover art bears little relation to the content of the book.  If Boy Meets Girl were Meg Cabot's debut novel, it would have sunk into remainder oblivion.<br />Fortunately, Cabot is famous, although I've never read her other books. I have a weakness for books written in correspondence style and enjoy writing that way myself.  The book's strength derives from the author's ability to capture the tone of modern-day office correspondence, from the Personnel Director's trailing &quot;This correspondence is confidential...&quot;  to heroine Kate's scrawls on a menu.<br />As Boy Meets Girl opens, Kate has just left her boyfriend of ten years, which meant leaving his apartment. Through her old college friend Jen, she has a job in the Human Resource department of a major newspaper and a couch to sleep while she looks for a new apartment.<br />Kate's boss Amy, a WASP alum of the Pi Delta sorority, runs a tight ship, influenced by her boyfriend, Stuart,  who just happens to be the company's lawyer.  When Ida refuses to serve Stuart a piece of her world-class pie, Stuart demands that Ida be fired -- and Amy orders Kate to do the deed.<br />When Ida's union sues the company, Kate meets Stuart's brother, Mitch, who's got a heart of gold as well as great looks.  And when Kate gets fired herself -- for telling the truth in a way that makes her boss looks bad -- Mitch comes riding to the rescue.<br />Cabot's correspondence style creates an omniscient viewpoint, without moving us from one character's mind to the other.  I love the email sequence of Jen urging Kate to stay on longer at her apartment; Jen's husband, like so many males in that situation, just wants his couch back.  And I enjoyed the dysfunctional family of Stuart and Mitch. Who wouldn't want a sister who dies her hair green and insists her name is Sean?<br />Naturally the characters are somewhat stereotyped, as befitting this type of novel.  However, there are delightful inconsistencies. Amy doesn't mind marrying into a family with a lesbian, but she's dismayed that her fiance may be part Jewish.  Kate's ex finds a girlfriend who asks Kate for background information.<br />The novel's only flaw didn't bother me till I put the book down and began to write this review. Kate comes across as a strong character who'd be fun to know, but she's quite passive throughout the book. Going through a tough time, she relies on her friends and their hospitality.  And she doesn't get herself out of her own mess.  We have a hero &quot;white knight&quot; who saves a maiden in distress.  I'd like to see Kate save herself.<br />Still, I found myself reading and turning pages. In fact, I wish I'd saved this book for a long boring airplane ride!

Michelle Banyon literally knocks over handsome Wilson Collins as she drives away from a Texas speaking engagement. She's built an organizing empire under the name Daisy Strait and has kept her own identity -- married to Steve Banyon, an international lawyer who travels a lot -- hidden from her adoring public.<br />With her husband out of the country more than he's in, Michelle begins spending time with Wilson, finally agreeing to a quickie wedding.  She loves both her husband and Wilson.  They both love her. So why not?<br />Confessions of a Bigamist is plausible. Whether it's realistic depends on your beliefs about the human psyche.  As an experienced businesswoman, Michelle would have realized the legal implications of a marriage. He could have claims on her wealth and she could be burdened with his debt.  And I'm not a lawyer but she may have committed crimes: bigamy, fraud...<br />However, I didn't get hung up on realism.  I would read this novel as playing out an interesting \\"what if\\" scenario, not as a literary character study that teaches us deeper lessons about life.  It's entertaining and it raises some questions. That's enough for a novel that's probably categorized as chick lit, perfect for summer reading.<br />To make Michelle more human, we see her rebuilding ties to her estranged sister and grown-up niece, Dottie, a dancer who finds the New York competition overwhelming. We only see Dottie in some degree of angst so those scenes don't add much.  Estranged siblings -- one domestic, one involved in business -- are pretty common in real life and fiction.<br />I kept turning the pages, expecting the author to take us right to the edge of a crisis. When a publisher makes a big offer on a book, and when she's featured on a tabloid cover, there's a big risk of exposure. Yet the author pulls back and the heroine never actually faces a confrontation.<br />As a result, we don't have a lot of suspense.  For some reason, the Texas people don't come to New York. I would expect Wilson to show up in Daisy Strait's office, all western and out of place. Or one of Michelle's new Texas friends could run into her shopping at Saks or eating dinner with her lawyer-husband.<br />Actually, this low-key story makes for less suspense but more realism. I suspect lots of people have long-term affairs and it wouldn't me the first time a second family was discovered when one spouse dies or has a crisis.  Usually the male is the bigamist and Lehrer spares our sensibilities by setting up childless marriages.<br />Some readers say the heroine wants to have it all. Maybe...but I see this book more as a questioning of the traditional institutions, specifically marriage.  When a husband travels extensively, the traditional wife stayed home, socialized with her women friends and waited.  However, today's wife brings a social and business background to the marriage.  And fidelity should be up to the partners in the relationship.<br />At one point, heroine Michelle points out that her husband, Steve, has more loyalty to his career than to their marriage. Who's the real bigamist? she asks.  And maybe that's the real question for readers who want to discuss this book.York.

US	43879637	R3FVKRQS4HOKV2	0312282710	688647970	Deep Pockets	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A smooth ride featuring an ex-cabbie	Deep Pockets opens with a classic PI ploy: a mysterious client doesn't want to reveal his name, but reluctantly admits he's in big trouble.  A Harvard professor, he's being blackmailed about an affair with a student.<br />Soon we realize there's something out of the ordinary about this student.  And soon the client, Wilson Cheney, has a lot more to worry about. He could be facing trial for murder.<br />Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed Deep Pockets and wasn't tempted to skip to the end. I didn't anticipate the plot twist and enjoyed following heroine Carlotta as she systematically followed clues to learn the truth. Author Barnes serves up some of the smoothest, easiest to follow writing of the series.<br />The subplots of Carlotta's personal life were easy to skip over.  Barnes does a good job of communicating the lack of chemistry with her FBI agent lover, but I'd like to see more sparks.<br />And Carlotta's &quot;little sister&quot; Paolina is ready to go up and fly the nest. As a minor character, she doesn't add anything to hold our interest. Barnes needs to give this teenager some faults to add conflict or let her disappear into boarding school, the way Parker moved Paul Giacomin offstage after Early Autumn.<br />The motive for the plot, relating to some research miracle drug, is handled well. Personally, my eyes glaze over when I read about  drug discoveries and old manuscripts turned up in attics. But that's just me.<br />And I think Barnes is a little too rough on Harvard -- she comes across almost as resentful. Robert Parker, the other Boston author, managed some sardonic quips about an imaginary university. And Susan Conant humorously compares Harvard to dog training schools.  Barnes is too heavy-handed and the school scenes could have been placed anywhere -- she hasn't picked up the Harvard aura.<br />Could this Denali character have gotten past admissions? Maybe. . But I think Harvard would have taken it in stride.  They'll be around a long time.	2004-06-05

As they point out, research shows that first impressions last a long time.  And as we meet people, we create first impressions on dates, business meetings and job interviews.<br />Writing in accessible self-help style, the authors identify the &quot;seven fundamentals of first impressions.&quot; These seven chapters make up the meat of the book. The authors discuss specific ways to show interest: body language, eye contact, name usage.<br />For instance, the chapter &quot;Enough about me&quot; encourages readers to show interest in their conversational partners.<br />The authors hold our interest -- and communicate effectively -- with examples and dialogues.  Some of the advice seems fairly obvious  (maintain eye contact, avoid closed-end questions) but much is new and useful (live vs. faux listening).<br />At the end of each chapter, the author not only list positive behaviors (e.g., make eye contact) but also show what each behavior communicates (e.g., &quot;interested, socially aware&quot;). They then list miscommunication behaviors in a clever chart form:  &quot;If you do this (&quot;listen inactively&quot;) you may think you seem ... (neutral) but you may seem ...  (uninterested).<br />I found the &quot;you may think you seem&quot; a little off-putting. Maybe we engage in these behaviors automatically without realizing how we seem!  Or maybe these behaviors demonstrate an aspect of our personality.<br />However, that's a small quibble, easy to ignore.<br />The section on topics was one of the fun ones, although perhaps useful only in a social, i.e., dating, context.  Don't go too deep into your own favorite topic, they say.  Put some topics on the table and keep going.<br />I must say I love talking to people about their specialties.  That's the writer/journalist in me!  The authors describe &quot;Ray,&quot; who delivered a monologue on washing machines, to his bored seatmate on an airplane flight. They suggest saying, &quot;That's interesting. I don't know much about washing machines, but I do know about film...&quot;<br />I must admit I'd have interrogated the poor man about his field, hoping to learn something to help with my own laundry day.  I once sat next to a veterinarian on a long, dreary plane ride, and learned a lot of useful information about cats. Now that I have a dog...<br />I resonated to the 4 &quot;wrong&quot; styles of conversation: story telling, lecturing, sermonizing and telling jokes. I do all of those, though hopefully not on a first meeting!<br />The authors offer some tips for corrective action, which can be summed up as enhanced self-awareness.  However, their strengths lie not in making change, but in identifying varieties of violations.<br />Although the authors briefly discuss &quot;heavy&quot; topics, they might have gone more deeply into reasons for varying degrees of disclosure.  For instance, most people ask casually, &quot;Do you have children? Brothers and sisters?&quot; All seemingly innocent questions -- but I know someone whose only daughter died, someone whose father disappeared and others who have legitimate reasons for avoiding those topics.  We could use some tips for maintaining a relationship along with our privacy.<br />Additionally, as a career coach, I wish the authors had discussed culture and gender differences that can create misunderstanding -- the material Deborah Tannen handles so well.  They do include informative research highlights but I'd have liked to see more detailed suggestions in the main text. For instance, in many subcultures, men are given more leeway to talk about themselves and to use a lecturing style.<br />And, as Tannen says, a New Yorker interrupts while a southerner (especially a southern woman) will be trained to be more polite and reticent. When you're meeting a new person in a new field, company, or region, you need to pick up cues toclarify what's considered appropriate behavior.<br />Finally, the authors could have used their corporate business experience to identify unique elements of business and career first impressions. Certain behaviors create good first impressions during job interviews, sales meetings and first days on the job.<br />The last two chapters were extremely valuable and could have been expanded: How to overcome a bad first impression and How to cut others some slack, so you won't let a bad first impression deny you a relationship.  I'd have liked to see an additional chapter on the second, third and fourth meetings, which often can be trickier than the first.

In ninety days, you can set goals and begin to move in a new direction.  Unlike many books of this genre, Now What does not overpromise. Ninety days won't find you in a new job or a new life -- but you'll have a better sense of where to go and how to get there.<br />I gave Now What five stars for easy reading and originality. I must admit I expected to find tired advice and exercises, but Fortgang offers mostly fresh ideas.  And I agree with much of what she says.<br />For example, &quot;Your purpose in life is right under your nose.&quot; So true!  I've seen versions of these life purpose exercises before but she presents them well.<br />Overall, true to her coaching background, some of the best exercises relate to identifying what you really want to do. &quot;I want to be someone who...&quot;<br />I applaud Fortgang's definitions of needs and values. Needs are not optional and non-negotiable, e.g., the need for honesty. Values are &quot;the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.&quot;  Needs bring out the worst in us when they're not met; values bring out the best.<br />But Fortgang goes beyond self-awareness, encouraging readers to check reality. She offers good advice for investigating various career fields: Talk to 3 people in 3 fields.  And she's not afraid to ask clients, &quot;What would you have to give up...&quot;<br />Perhaps the very best exercises involve scenario-writing. Describe how your life will be in a year, then six months from now, then three months from now.  These steps clarify the need for actions along the way.<br />Anyone contemplating a life change can have fun with these exercises.  They'll help you change your thinking and uncover ideas.  My major reservation comes from a warning in Herminia Ibarra's book, Working Identity.  Often self-discovery tends to be easier than implementing change.  If you're in a comfort zone, you'll need another book  -- or a coach -- to get moving, even if you know where you want to be.<br />And there's a downside of a book that appeals to many people for many kinds of change.  You have to take practical, specific tips with a grain of salt.  For instance, Fortgang alludes to moving to a place with a lower cost of living -- but this type of move often contains hidden pitfalls.

It's about taking proactive steps to avoid being in a one-down position.<br />You'll like Fire Your Boss if you buy into the authors' value system  Pollan and Levine don't mince words.  Work, they say, is about money. Given a choice of two job offers, choose whichever gives you the most money, time or both. Don't expect satisfaction and fulfillment from work.<br />For many people, this advice will make sense. However, some people work in truly toxic environments and they'll become ill -- mentally and/or physically -- if they stay. Some companies (such as SAS in North Carolina) offer quality of life that makes sense for many employees. And some people manage to have truly wonderful jobs.<br />Once on the job, say the authors, success comes from pleasing your boss. Never mind the company: it's all about keeping your boss on your side because she's the only person who can help you.  In general, this advice is excellent; however, company culture can influence your boss's power, your ability to transfer within the firm and/or your ability to avoid being fired.<br />I stay away from absolutes -- so &quot;Nobody hires a stranger&quot; should be translated, &quot;People like to hire their friends.&quot; The best section of the book covers networking: these days, you make friends, not contacts. So your long-term strategy will involve joining groups and socializing with people who can help you.<br />And, as with all career books, you have to do some reality checks. When you get a competing offer from an outside firm, say the authors, pay attention to a counter-offer from your own firm.  However, some experts say that sixty to eighty percent of employees who accept those counteroffers are gone in six months. If you do accept a counteroffer, get a contract or the type of termination agreement these authors recommend.<br />The very best advice from these authors: Always keep &quot;fishing,&quot; as they say. Never stop watching the job market. Prepare to move for the right conditions.<br />I don't agree with their checklists of &quot;factors&quot; -- I've developed my own decision processes -- and I think you have to be careful before jumping ship too fast. Some people are hired to be scapegoats, some bosses have hidden agendas, and some employees do get stranded in tiny towns in the middle of nowhere.<br />I suspect the authors fill in the blanks when they're coaching one-to-one and/or they choose their clients very, very carefully.  And I definitely recommend this book as a perspective that, while incomplete, offers a helpful corrective to the airy promises of &quot;Dream and do it.&quot;<br />For career change, I'd supplement with Herminia Ibarra's Working Identity and Martha Beck's Finding Your Own North Star.stop watching the job market.

Discovers herself through transforming domestic, warm-and-fuzzy talents into a commercial enterprise. And, if single, she gets a romantic interest as a bonus.<br />As it happens, I rather like this sub-sub genre.  And Lolly Winston gives us a heroine who's likeable and intelligent. She adds an edge by giving us a blow-by-blow account of a year in the life of a grieving widow. In this case, the grief seems especially painful because Sophie, the heroine, is young, and because she lost her own mother at a very young age.<br />Sophie's grief seems like a blanket someone has thrown over her life, stifling her energy. Like most employers, Sophie's company allots a limited time for grieving. After that, Sophie is supposed to be a cheerful PR person, extolling the virtues of some deeply flawed medical product.<br />Just as she hits bottom in her career, an old friend invites Sophie to move from California's Silicon Valley to Ashland, Oregon.  And Sophie's new life begins.<br />Sophie finds a charming rental cottage and a job in a restaurant, where she gets downgraded from waitress to salad prep and then to pastry, where she finds her true niche.  She begins to study baking in earnest and, along the way, finds a new love and a new career.<br />Of course, it's not quite that easy. Sophie becomes a Big Sister (the reasons are a little value and I'm surprised she was accepted, given her grief-stricken state). Her Little Sister, Crystal, isn't the cuddly eight-year-old she expected, but a tough-talking teen with a ditzy mom and potentially serious problems.  Some of Sophie's descents into grief can be hard to read, despite a comedic element.  Sophie's opening party pushes the envelope when anything that can go wrong does go wrong.<br />In the end Sophie emerges as a strong heroine, although some elements of the happy ending owe more to luck than to Sophie's efforts.  As a career coach, I wish these authors wouldn't make starting a business seem so effortless.  But I have to say that most career transformations happen just this way: putting one foot in front of the other, remaining open to new options, and being willing to follow your passion to see where it leads.wish these authors wouldn't make starting a business seem so effortless.

Gerhart's book is neither a puff piece nor a hatchet job.  Readers seeking either will be disappointed.  Gerhart instead presents a balanced, factual account of Laura Bush. And if you read between the lines, you will realize she's more complex than she appears.<br />First, as other reviewers noted, the most astounding piece of Laura's history is her car accident at age seventeen. There's no evidence that she had been drinking, yet she mysteriously ran a very visible stop sign. Even more mysteriously, the city declined to prosecute. She didn't even get a traffic tickert for running a stop sign and smashing into a truck, instantly killing the driver. Later she realized she had killed a good friend.<br />I can't help wondering where Laura Welch (her maiden name) would be today if she had been charged with involuntary manslaughter.  Would she have gone on become an SMU sorority girl?  A teacher and librarian?<br />Maybe the real lesson isn't that Laura got away with something but that we shouldn't be too quick to punish someone for a one-time mistake, however tragic.<br />And while Laura never talks about the &quot;accident,&quot; there must have been long-lasting impact.  Did this experience contribute to her shy, self-effacing qualities?<br />Relatedly, we get a sense of the Bush family dyamics.  In his younger days, Bush did his share of drinking and partying.  Laura had memories of her tragic accident.  when Twins Jenna and Barbara grow up to be self-absorbed, uncontrollable brats. An analyst would have a field day with this family.<br />And there's the unspoken question. How does Laura Bush, a smart woman with mostly liberal friends, separate her husband's political persona from her own values?  She does what she can and doesn't even try to impinge on her husband's territory.<br />We also learn about Laura Bush's book programs, where she invites authors to read and contribute. Most authors, being liberals, are reluctant to accept, but soon they are won over by Laura's intellect. She's a real reader.<br />And she's hardly a doormat. Barbara Bush would be a formidable mother-in-law but Laura avoids yielding.  Nor does she take the easy way out.  Barbara's issue was literacy, so Laura makes it clear her approach will be different.<br />I'm reminded of stories of another big Texan president, Lyndon Johnson Indeed, Laura refers to Johnson when she compares herself to other first ladies.  Like Laura, Lady Bird knew when to push and when to back off, and she retained her own integrity.<br />After reading the book, it's hard to see how Laura and George came together so successfuly. They're opposite in many ways. Gerhart hints of disagreement on key political issues.  Laura reads; George doesn't.  Laura is devoted to her children; George flew to Florida for a planned vacation while Jenna underwent an emergency appendectomy.  In the end, Perfect Wife isn't about politics.

He's based in Boston, not flying off to some desert town in Arizona. He brings back the gang: Hawk, Vinnie, Susan, and more.<br />Reading Bad Business means visiting these old friends. Like many of Parker's readers, they've become middle-aged and settled. (In a much earlier book, Spenser reluctantly dons reading glasses!)  As a result, there's less room for character growth. Susan's a successful shrink, significant other and non-cook...just as she was in the last ten or so books. Hawk continues to be larger-than-life.  Where can they go from here?  Author Parker needs to give them some tough challenges to reveal new layers.<br />The plot of this novel has been amply described in editorial reviews as well as other customer reviews. I agree with those who question the financial elements of the plot, where Spenser is out of his element. He's much better when he can mete out his own version of justice.<br />However, Parker has managed to capture subtle aspects of corporate life with his usual wit, one beat away from satire. I've met CEO's just like Bob Cooper. Although they headed smaller companies, they put on a good show, demonstrated boundless enthusiasm even when they'd rather be eating mud, and kept their hands clean.<br />Even so, I wish Parker had focused more on the &quot;growth seminars&quot; and their aftermath. And I wish the villains had been more evil and less weasly.  Nobody worth shooting here!<br /> In my opinion, Early Autumn was Parker's all-time best book. You could read Early Autumn as a textbook of child and adolescent psychology.  Other books showed Spenser's biting wit as he cut through conventions and pretentious displays.  Plots were tighter and held more surprises.<br />Everybody's mellowed. Inevitable but Bad Business still held my attention more than most mysteries I read these days. And I'll be waiting for the next.	2004-05-10

These days, authors are taught that readers really do judge a book by its cover and titles can make or break a book.  If I were teaching a writing class, I'd use \\"Children of God Go Bowling\\" as a brilliant example!<br />I did not read Olson's first book, so I was pleasantly surprised by the novel.  There seems to be an emerging genre of books about single women in their 20's and 30's, growing older and growing desperate aobut finding a mate.<br />Olson's heroine bemoans her single status but otherwise her life seems to be working better than she realizes.  She has a great job that seems to function on automatic pilot.  (As a career coach, I can't help being amazed that *no* character experienced major job problems! Well, one character has a little stress, but he immediately changes jobs easily.)<br />Shannon's income allows her to move to a great apartment when one becomes available.  She also manages to afford an amazing amount of therapy, which apparently occupies three evenings a week.  She has \\"the counselor,\\" a friendly woman who calls her \\"honey\\" and seems more like a big sister than a therapist. She adds a psychiatrist , who prescribes medication, and group therapy -- not, as the book jacket says, to find friends, but because \\"the counselor\\" thinks she's ready.<br />Shannon is surprised that the group has time to help her with furniture questions, but the group does seem more social than therapeutic.<br />One tragedy in the book does seem to undercut the comedic mood, but it's handled gracefully and optimistically. I'm reminded of the video God Said Ha.  The discussion of religion (\\"Is it because he's a Lutheran?\\") are funny and add a deeper dimension to the book.<br />Shannon's counselor admonishes at the outset, \\"It's not all about you.\\" Yet for a single marriage-centered woman, self-focus is not all that uncommon. I don't see Shannon as overly dependent: she has her apartment and job, and these days, that's doing really well.<br />Shannon's therapists ironically encouraged even more self-focus. I wish they'd told her to get a life -- develop a hobby, take classes -- rather than continue to look for a man in the most unlikely places.  Her decision at the end of the book signals a new beginning. Of course, if she rebuilds her life and gets too together, we won't have a novel.<br />The author writes well and holds our interest, although the pace could be a bit faster and some of the subplots could be tightened.  I got a little tired of Shannon's questions about her relationship with an old college friend (friends or lovers? are we or aren't we?) but didn't doubt the realism for a moment.therapists ironically encouraged even more self-focus.

US	43879637	RZT4MLC057HB7	1586481584	516136956	The Two Percent Solution: Fixing America's Problems In Ways Liberals And Conservatives Can Love	Books	4	10	14	N	N	More Problems than Solutions	Books that promise to fix big problems remind me of the time I sat behind two little old ladies on a bus.  Noticing an empty bus go by in mid-afternoon, one said to the other, &quot;They should use smaller buses during rush hour.&quot;<br />Of course, the ladies hadn't considered the cost of operating two fleets of different types of equipment!  But their naïve approach isn't that different from what we see in most &quot;what we need to do&quot; books. Miller's is better than most.<br />Miller's ideas are sound and well-thought-out. The book is worth reading, if only because Miller has a knack for pinpointing issues and gaining access to knowledgeable sources.  The book also forms a basis for thought-provoking discussion. However, many systems are not working because they were designed for another era. What's needed is an overhaul, not a quick fix.<br />Miller's contribution is to find &quot;solutions&quot; that are not only economically feasible but also acceptable to both conservatives and liberals.  To this end, he focuses on specific elements of large systems.  For example, education depends on teacher quality, and teacher quality is compromised by low teachers' salaries. Vouchers make sense for everyone.  And we need to finance some form of universal health insurance.<br />Raising teacher salaries may be a start, but I would encourage research into real reasons teachers leave and potential teachers fail to enter the profession.  Aside from money, teaching K-12 means coming to a workplace that's almost as rigid as a factory.  A college graduate might become an engineer not only because of the salary differential, but also because she'll have more freedom and flexibility in her workday. She'll travel to conferences, take an afternoon off, and probably have a phone on her desk.<br />Miller brings up a key point: State-based teacher certification means that teachers who move must pay for expensive, useless updates.  He's right -- but I think we need to look at all certification processes. In a world where a local and long-distance calls blend together, maybe it's time to question all state-based programs.<br />But there's a more fundamental concern here.  Teaching, like career systems, assumes the 1950's model: enter a career at twenty-one and remain till you retire.  Many people would enjoy a stint at teaching -- but this choice can create obstacles to future choice.  Some states have separate retirement systems for teachers. And, as Miller notes, education courses are so stultifying that the best-and-brightest drop out early.<br />We need to see teaching in the context of changing career patterns-- and the context of education itself. Increasingly parents opt for home schooling.  Anstead of funding teachers for inner city schools, maybe we need to focus on inner cities themselves. As he implies, if you're afraid to leave your car on the street, no amount of money will motivate someone to teach in a neighborhood.<br />To take another example, anyone who urges universal health coverage should spend time in Canada. Waiting lists are long and I have heard several first-hand stories of a black market:  people who jumped the queue because they knew someone, served on hospital boards and/or simply paid a doctor a lump sum under the table.  Additionally, Canada uses the US as their backup plan. Many corporations send executives to the US for physicals and care and wealthy people bypass the local system entirely, heading for the US.<br />Middle and upper income residents bear the burden of universal health coverage. For many, the higher Canadian taxes come to more than a high-quality insurance premium in the US.  Lower-income and poor residents come out way ahead.<br />While Miller makes some excellent points, we need to focus on the way medical care is delivered and chosen in the twenty-first century.  A huge amount of money goes to end-of-life care, which often is neither wanted nor useful.  Nearly every week the New York Times reports the uselessness of yet another expensive, invasive procedure.<br />We also base coverage on values.  Should we fund fertility treatments, abortions or both?  Should insurance support therapy for someone who is functioning well but wants to know himself better -- for a year two?<br />Additionally, care choices will be influenced by insurance. After changing employers, one manager told me, &quot;I have to pay more for my insurance now, so my wife and I make sure we get our money's worth.  We go to the clinic even for colds.&quot;  Another said, &quot;My elderly parents visit the doctor once a week, probably because they're bored. He can't refuse to see them and of course he bills Medicare for their visits.&quot;<br />We all know horror stories of unnecessary surgery and medication. And often a high-tech solution works no better than a lower-cost, low-tech option.  Massage, for instance, can cost considerably less than medication for certain conditions.  Meditation remains an effective way to lower blood pressure and reduce stress.<br />I'm suspicious of band-aids, but that's all we're likely to get in the next fifty years or so. At least Miller's solutions will hurt less than many of the alternatives and may even help us get to the longer-term benefits, one step at a time.the New York Times reports the uselessness of yet another expensive, invasive procedure.   <br />We also base coverage on values.

Books	5	110	116	N	N	Light novel, heavy questions	This book was given to me for review and my first reaction was, \\"Not my kind of book!\\"  The book's opening didn't help: -- a disheveled down-and-out southern woman returns to her hometown, driving a beat-up old car, accompanied by her late husband's only legacy: a basset hound she loves to hate.<br />But after a few pages, I began to care about the story line. Why did Sugar Beth dread returning home? Why did so man people hate her so much?  And how can we care about a heroine who's done such despicable things in the past?<br />This book is a model of a book that's a crossover between romance and women's fiction.  The author takes us to the edge of the cliff with a worst case scenario.  Sugar Beth, high school prom queen, the girl everybody envied, has become a woman who's lost everything.<br />Meanwhile, Sugar Beth's former victims have all grown up and become wildly successful.  They vividly remember Sugar Beth and they're perfectly positioned to take revenge.<br />So why doesn't Sugar Beth just go to, say, Los Angeles and get an anonymous job?  Turns out she needs to find a painting she inherited. She can sell this unique art work for millions of dollars.  And while she hunts for this painting, she needs a job.  And who has the power to give her a job? You guessed it: Those she once scorned.<br />In one climactic scene, Sugar Beth is pitted against these vengeful people and she's in a one-down position.  She's backed into a corner.<br />But Sugar Beth rises to the challenge. She handles herself with dignity and we soon learn her secret reasons for needing the money from the sale of the painting.  She's different yet she's held on to the strongest parts of herself.  She triumphs by her own grit and we're mostly satisfied with the ending.<br />The big romance between the two main characters follows conventions of the genre. If you can't figure out who will get together with whom, you haven't read enough, although author Philips throws in enough quirks to keep the romance line from being too trite.<br />Underneath the main story, the author raises intriguing questions that could keep a book club going for hours.  Are we the same people we were ten years ago? Fifteen years ago? Should we be held accountable for dumb things we did when we were seventeen?  And should people pay for those mistakes for the rest of their lives?keep the romance line from being too trite.  <br />Underneath the main story, the author raises intriguing questions that could keep a book club going for hours.

This book can be an eye-opener.<br />7 Money Mantras (&quot;MM&quot;) offers such a unique perspective it's not a stand-alone. I recommend reading 7MM in conjunction with other books on money management, to get a well-rounded perspective.  Singletary speaks to a specific target market: those who have run up credit card debts and developed unhealthy patterns that have spun their lives out of control.  If her first person accounts are true (most authors exaggerate at least a little!) then she's determined to eradicate seeds of financial destruction before they take root and grow.<br />The best parts of 7MM are the parts dealing with family and setting limits with adult children. I never had the luxury of moving back home and have no children, but I watch neighbors and friends make huge sacrifices for kids who have no motivation to move and grow.  Some of these sections are hilarious -- I laughed out loud at her response to her nephew's question, &quot;Doesn't rent include food?&quot;<br />&quot;Well,&quot; she answers, &quot;when you're on your own, ask your landlord when you can expect him to drop by with a bag of groceries.&quot;<br />Some suggestions will have to be adapted for specific lifestyles.  I *love* doggie bags and enjoyed her support as I often get teased.  Most restaurant meals are too big and I take half home for next day's lunch.<br />I choose not to have cable, which she would applaud, but I do have a DVD.  As she points out, it is tempting to buy DVD's but you don't just get a better picture: the director's cut adds significantly to enjoyment, if you're a film buff.<br />And while she's right on the money (!) about families, she misses the mark on singles. Sure, a home-cooked meal is a welcome gift...but I would *much* rather meet someone for lunch in a restaurant.  Spending an evening with a family can be stressful.<br />And I believe Singletary needs to add a caution for people who have good jobs.  I once worked with a sales manager who lugged two shopping bags of paper towels back to the office after lunch, cheerily bragging that he'd saved five dollars.  Aside from looking a little silly, he communicated that his focus was saving not earning -- not a good image for someone in his field!<br />For someone moving up, an investment in clothes and haircut can pay huge dividends.  And sometimes you need to get what you pay for.  Finding the cheapest dentist, therapist or coach can cost a bundle.  It's easy to go overboard in either direction.<br />Similarly, Singletary misses some social significance of meals. Eating lunch with coworkers can be the best -- sometimes the only -- way to network.  And while a letter or email can be cheaper than a call, there are all sorts of ways to get discounted phone calls nowadays. I use a calling card that costs three cents a minute.<br />So bottom line, this book can suggest creative ways to save, but I recommend using the text as a starting point for discussion and a new way to study your spending -- not the final word.for people who have good jobs.

US	43879637	R2HNPZ8UQW9SN3	0375413189	900014736	The Spiral Staircase: My Climb Out of Darkness	Books	5	49	55	N	N	Spiritual journey as winding road	Karen Armstrong's book could be read and analyzed as a text itself.  At first the text seems a bit dry. Armstrong is, after all, a true British lady.  The style reminds me of other British-empire women, such as Jill Ker Conway.  It's a book that demands  and rewards close reading, preferably repeated readings over time.<br />I see Spiral Staircase first as a series of ironies.  Armstrong clearly was harmed by her stifling convent, but her post-convent encounters with medical and academic systems seem remarkably similar.  Her convent superiors believed her &quot;fits&quot; were emotionally based, but so did a series of psychiatrists and physicians.<br />In her first book, Through the Narrow Gate, and again here, Armstrong remembers the time her superior ordered her to practice using a sewing machine without a needle -- a pointless exercise to instill obedience.  Yet at Oxford, Armstrong invested three years writing a thesis that would be failed by a prejudiced but powerful examiner.  There were no safeguards in the system to prevent  a student from embarking on a topic that would be judged inadequate, and even a free-thinking dame valued maintaining the Oxford tradition over righting an injustice.<br />A final irony is that Armstrong's final career was probably made possible by her earlier series of &quot;wrong&quot; choices. Her first book and her experience as a nun probably gave her the &quot;platform&quot; that publishers require for nonfiction.<br />And the experience of old-fashioned convents seems to have brought about many benefits, judging by the success of many ex-nuns. One nun I knew many years ago (who claimed her order was far more enlightened!) pointed out that novitiate training and discipline create a confident, poised woman.  Even if she abandons her order and her religion, she's ready to run anything from a convent kitchen to a Fortune 50 corporation.<br />Armstrong's book also illustrates a career path that's far more typical than many career counselors would admit. Her spiral path, which I call a &quot;winding road&quot; in my own articles, shows how serendipity often shapes careers. Armstrong took risks and accepted jobs that developed her skills and created a network.  She sees convent, academia, teaching, and television as failures, yet each contributed a piece to her ultimate career mosaic.<br />And parallel to her career quest, she's exploring new ways to think about religion.  An epileptic child benefits from religion without beliefs. She discovers Judaism and Islam.  Don't miss her quote on pages 270-271: &quot;I have discovered the religious quest is not about discovering 'the truth' or 'the meaning of life' but about living as intensely as possible here and now.&quot;<br />You can respond with an &quot;Amen!&quot; or &quot;You bet!&quot; Either would fit the spirit of this thoughtful, worthwhile book.career counselors would admit.

We've had almost four decades of books on women and careers, so it's hard to offer something new.  Much of what Frankel offers will seem familiar, yet she packages her advice in easy-to-take bullets.  I recommend the book as a reminder -- something to keep reading even when you think you've learned it all, because we all forget.<br />Although all these tips seem worthwhile, implementing them can be tricky. How, for instance, do we stop being naive?  And some mistakes are not only common to both men and women but also have become embedded in unhealthy corporate cultures. Take breaks, she says, and don't pinch company pennies...yet some companies play the &quot;I can work longer than you&quot; game of staying late for &quot;face time,&quot; while others will criticize employees who follower her suggestion to call a cab service rather than wait for a bus.  And I suspect that, even now, a woman's expenses and time may be scrutinized more than a man's, in some environments.<br />Frankel's best tips relate to communications: avoid explaining, don't couh statements as questions, don't sit on one foot (I hadn't thought of this one!) and don't tilt your head unless you're inviting openness.  I must admit I get irritated with women (AND some men!) who preface questions with, &quot;This is a dumb question, but...&quot; or some other preamble. Just ask!  And the networking tips shouldn't be missed, especially a rare example of how networking can save a career.<br />I was unnerved by the advice to avoid blindly obeying  your boss.  You can, as she says, end up in legal trouble by obeying a n illegal order.  However, if you're in this situation, there's not much you can do and you probably have to leave. Going to your boss's boss, as Frankel suggests, must be done with the greatest care and preferably another offer in hand.  Most people still get ahead by making the boss look good and if you can't do this, you probably have to move.<br />Then again, there are few absolutes in careers or anything else. Women can do worse than to keep this book at home -- not in the office, where one should display only a calm, confident self.in careers or anything else.

The tapes make wonderful travel companions on a long journey.<br />Other reviewers have summarized the plot. Seventeen-year-old Henry discovers his mother is having an affair. Meanwhile, his sister Elvira engages in Civil War games, posing as \\"Elvernon,\\" a hard-core participant, to the consternation of the same mother.  Kevin, the father, comes across as a fairly passive history teacher, who supports the daughter and doesn't seem to interact much with Henry.<br />Other reviewers complain that the narrator doesn't seem seventeen. Well, he's not! Right at the outset, he reveals that he's writing about events that happened about ten years earlier, so he's 27 or 28.  During the year of the novel, he's a realistic, if somewhat precocious, teenager.<br />Wisely, the narrative focuses on the most contradictory characters: Henry's mother Beth and his sister Elvira. Beth can be a paragon of domesticity (flipping her award-winning pancakes for breakfast) but she also has her book club and her affair. And in one scene, Henry suspects she's pushed him towards a romantic liaison.<br />Elvira's passion is the Civil War, especially 1862. She has a female friend who typifies today's overconfident preteens, but she's happiest when she's in the field posing as \\"Elvernon.\\"  Elvira refuses to wear dresses and, at one point, shaves her head. Her mother worries: Is Elvira going to become a Lesbian?<br />Kevin, the father, hovers in the background, often pulled by his own intellectual curiosity. However, Kevin understands Elvira and he reveals true wisdom when he points out that her Civil War re-enactments will give her skills wherever she ends up.  And he behaves heroically in a crucial scene near the end.<br />Hamilton's pacing is flawless.  We move through some humorous episodes -- a wedding, visit to Beth's lover, visit to a fortune-teller, first love at camp -- to reach the pivotal scene of destruction.  There is considerable irony as Beth and Elvira inadvertently contribute to each other's crisis.<br />I can't say more without spoiling a magnificent ending.<br />It's the kind of book you want to discuss when you're done -- a perfect selection for a book club, preferably one that's more serious than the one in this book!Beth and Elvira inadvertently contribute to each other's crisis.  <BR>I can't say more without spoiling a magnificent ending.<br />It's the kind of book you want to discuss when you're done -- a perfect selection for a book club, preferably one that's more serious than the one in this book!	2004-03-30

Offer of Proof combines the best of Linda Fairstein, John Grisham and Lawrence Block (Matt Scudder series). Unlike Fairstein, Heilbrun actually takes us into the courtroom. We learn how the law really works, a series of bargains and random outcomes -- very scary.<br />Unlike Grisham, Heilbrun delivers realistic characters and challenges that are realistic, not larger than life.  And unlike Block in his Scudder series, Heilbrun creates a proactive character who's lost a lot but manages to avoid the down-and-out-detective stereotype.  Hero Arch Gold takes chances and sometimes loses. He's smart but he's no super-hero -- a three-dimensional character with depth.<br />And Heilbrun maintains a fast pace. There's no temptation to skip a section or read ahead.  We're introduced right away to the black 18-year-old who managed to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, who lacks the maturity to be &quot;managed&quot; to make the jury like him.  And we're on edge as the defense experiences one setback after another, up to the nail-biting moment when Gold faces a crackerjack prosecutor.<br />Best of all, the ending seems satisfactory, with a last-minute curve that works. When you go back over the first part of the book you realize Heilbrun didn't miss a detail.  He doesn't drop clues but he's totally consistent.<br />So what's not to like?  Well, if you start thinking too much about the legal system, you can get scared.  Justice depends on luck of the draw. A good lawyer won't protect you from a bad judge and a hanging jury.  It's all a game, a dueling match between hired guns.  If you've had misgivings about the system before you pick up this up, you may find yourself tossing and turning, just like the hero does.	2004-03-19

Unlike other reviewers, I enjoyed Rei's experience of returning to America after living so long in Japan. We see Japan through her Americanized eyes and then we see San Francisco filtered through her Japanese experience.<br />I agree with other reviewers: This series is best read from beginning to end.  But if you've been following Rei Shimura and have come to care about the heroine, this volume offers background into the heroine's life and how she has been formed into a unique individual -- someone who grew up in the US but lives comfortably in Japan.<br />The plot was a little far-fetched and there is some reliance on coincidence.  Most readers will smell a rat as soon as they meet the character who turns out to be the villain, although the connection won't seem at all obvious. However, I didn't mind and didn't question the plot or the motive until I put the book down, after a long and satisfying read.<br />And Rei's alliance with Hugh should lead to more adventures. As others have noted, the author is at<br />her best when she's writing about Japan. However, beginning with The Bride's Kimono, I suspect the author wants to write more about the US. And I'll look forward to the next volume in the series, no matter where it  takes place.	2004-03-17

Ranger Anna Pigeon is back, graying and pushing fifty, and very much her own person.  Going undercover in Yosemite's prestigious resort, she works as a waitress caught between a temperamental chef and a dictatorial head waitress.  Anna has been detailed to the park because four young workers have disappeared, mysteriously, and investigators hope she will pick up clues by blending in as a lowly staff person.<br />High Country is archetypal Nevada Barr.  As usual, Anna meets a cast of characters who seem larger than life because her Park world is so claustrophobic.  And as usual, she's matter-of-fact about everything, always the detached observor.  She belongs but she's always a little on the outside.<br />As usual, Barr serves up scenery. We get a vivid picture of Anna in the High Country, using her wits to outmaneuver two murderers, includes every detail. Anna realizes how far she's willing to go to save herself, accomplish her mission and return to Paul, her fiance back in Mississippi. We see a new side of Anna as she transports herself to New York, where her sister lives, and to Mississippi, where Paul takes care of her animals.  I'm reminded of Martha Beck's visions in Expecting Adam.<br />The grayness of a Yosemite December seemed real.  In summer, Anna would be dodging tourists at every corner. I think she's remarkably patient about being separated from her fiance -- surely they'd have a way to communicate?<br />Anna grows and some readers may not be comfortable watching.  Her sister, now married, seems less available. Engaged to Paul, she tentatively reaches for the traditionally feminine symbols. She slows down, physically, and accepts the aging process with grace.<br />So I'm not ready to see Anna retire!  And authors are human, so Barr undoubtedly will change the way she writes about Anna.  So far, I'm still a fan. This series remains one of the most literate and sensitive on the market.  Let's hope the publishers and the bookstores keep it there.	2004-03-15

One Army captain, assigned to the Military Police, told me he never sees his brothers because they're in jail or on welfare. A quiet librarian can't relate to his brother, an outgoing car salesman.<br />But this book is not about dealing with the merely dysfunctional sibling -- the sister who ran off and got pregnant and hits you up for money or the brother who disapproves of your lifestyle.  This book deals with really serious mental illness in families.  As the author claims, often family live centers on the damaged child, while the &quot;normal&quot; sibling gets ignored.<br />Safer's major contribution is to show the way sibling relationships pervade our lives, even unconsciously. A woman feels guilty when she experiences success, while her sibling begs in front of the church they used to attend as children. The siblings always exist in shadows. And Safer also tells us how little research has been conducted on sibling relationships. Even as a therapist, she had to carve her own path with few guidelines.<br />While I usually enjoy books with many narrative tales, I began to get a sense of repetition as I read this one.  People felt guilty. They wondered how much they had to give. Often they felt relief when they gave up.<br />As other reviewers pointed out, Safer offers few stories of successful sibling relationships.  Mothers write proudly of their experiences with disabled children. Read, for instance, Martha Beck's book, Expecting Adam. Perhaps some children look back with gratitude on their experiences of growing up with a disabled sibling.  In the movie, There's Something About Mary, the heroine visits her disabled brother on a regular basis.  Is that realistic?<br />Then again, a parent chooses to have a child, and parents have the maturity and experience to gain perspective.<br />A good book,  which raises our awareness of a common concern that's poorly understood.	2004-03-15
US	43879637	R3THAYWJ3NN6RT	0618109617	212256296	The Mystery of Breathing: A Novel	Books	5	14	16	N	N	The politics of accusation	I picked up this book because the author was, well, Perri Klass.  It's hard to imagine her writing anything that is not worthwhile and this time she surpassed my expectations.<br />Heroine Maggie Claymore seems to have a lot going for her: a distinguished career as a neonatologist at a prestigious teaching hospital, a supportive husband, a house and some good friends.  Yet when she begins receiving anonymous accusations, she becomes vulnerable. Her accuser doesn't stop with poison pen letters, but instead goes on to post warnings in public hallways.<br />Some reviewers say this novel deals with the psychology of Maggie Claymore, a complex achiever who can intimidate students and colleagues. In fact I believe it's a case study in the politics and sociology of accusation.  And the lesson Maggie -- and we, the readers -- learn is that an anonymous accusation can have more power than first-hand evidence.<br />As the media begins to take on this theme, we can begin to recognize a pattern.  High-status accusers  can escape the consequences of their accusation. Accused individuals who seem &quot;different&quot; or who are &quot;outsiders&quot; are more vulnerable to accusations and less likely to escape the consequences.<br />Maggie's hospital hires an investigator, Donna Leon. Like all characters in this thoughtful novel, Donna has flaws and it's hard to like her. Yet she delivers the goods. The hospital's reaction is classic.  They're interested less in justice than in preserving status and status quo.<br />I read this book after renting a DVD version of Capturing the Friedmans, an award-winning documentary.  The parallels are striking.  Interestingly, I have found few research studies of accusation in the literatures of psychology and sociology.  Hopefully this book will provoke further recognition of the power of accusations to create new victims.	2004-03-15

As an avid fan of Susan Conant, I found this book to be one of the best -- if not *the* best -- of the Holly Winter series. Of course, I'm biased.  You may not feel the same way if you're new to the Conant series.  And of course, you may not feel the same way if you're not a dog-lover.<br />Holly finally is ready to marry her true love, veterinarian Steve Delaney. They'll join not only their lives but also their dogs. Holly reconciles herself to the wedding rituals when she realizes she'll be holding the place of honor as Best of Show. Of course, the dogs will be in the wedding party, which limits their choice of locations.  And she's signing copies of her new cookbook for dogs, featuring her favorite liver treats.<br />As Holly whirls through the preparations, a serial killer seems to be targeting women who have some connection to dogs.  Holly doesn't get involved but inadvertently puts together pieces that point to a killer surprisingly close to home.<br />Experienced mystery readers will recognize the red herring dangled before them. They'll realize this person can't be the murderer, but I have to admit I wondered how the author could come up with another plausible killer.  About eighty pages before the end of the book, she drops clues with a thud, and most readers will guess the real villain's identity.  And they'll admire the way Conant pulls it off, dropping hints to add motive and plausibility.<br />I was never tempted to peek at the end. I waited for the author to solve the crime at her own pace and enjoyed every moment along the way.<br />Long-time readers will love the last scene. Right after capturing the killer, Holly and Steve hold their rehearsal and dinner. Next day, they're joined in a wedding ceremony that will leave dog fanatics misty-eyed.  If you've never had a dog, you may think it's over the top, but it's what I would want for myself. And let's thank the author for sparing us the recipes.<br />The only omission is Holly's new cat, Tracker, described as ugly and unloveable.  Cats may be independent, but I've seen cats warm up to affectionate, patient owners.  Leaving the poor cat alone all day won't improve its disposition!  Author Conant's bio includes reference to two cats, so she should know!  Hopefully Tracker will get more attention in the next volume.described as ugly and unloveable.

If you're a new writer, and you can buy only one book, buy this one!<br />Mary Lynn, author of eleven published novels and countless articles, knows what editors want.  She contributes columns for a monthly regional writers newsletter as well as The Writer.  While this book focuses on format -- page length, spacing and more -- you'll learn about the business of writing, too.  What do you send to a magazine editor? What type of query would you send to an agent, as compared to a publisher?  How do you really count words in a novel?<br />Having lived in Silver City, I have the privilege of hearing Mary and her husband, Ted Lynn, host our local writers' group.  Although I've read dozens of books about writing, the Lynns are the only people who tell it like it is. Yes, writing is a business. It's tough and competitive.  But if you understand the business, you actually have a chance to succeed and to make some money.<br />The Lynns are realists but they're also encouraging. Most people, they say, give up too soon.  And the vast majority have no idea how to submit queries, chapters, synopses and more.  When you look like a pro, you're taken more seriously by agents and editors, which means you're likely to get a response.  I've found that to be true in my own writing.<br />While the content of writing will be important to success,<br />getting your queries and submissions out the door, in proper format, will be a critical first step.  After all, if an editor shrugs off your submission as, &quot;Obviously an amateur!&quot; you'll never get as far as having the content evaluated.<br />That's why I recommend starting with this book. When you know what you need at the end, you can set up your drafts from the very beginning.	2004-03-04

The book jacket copy gives no clue to the story, which is why I was caught by surprise mid-book and actually stopped reading.  The book jacket describes the story's opener -- a potentially riveting courtroom drama, very timely in light of the Kobe Bryant case: a young woman claims she was date-raped by a wealthy financier -- the kind of man who seems immune to prosecution. It's a he-said/she-said case, although the man's young son will be a witness for the prosecution if he can be found.<br />If I had been on the jury,I would not have bought the woman's story of being &quot;forced&quot; to submit to rape and her actions to &quot;save&quot; the little boy seem questionable and possibly illegal.  But as Fairstein's character points out,<br />women of my age rarely sympathize with these victims.<br />Meanwhile, Alexandra Cooper's cop friends become involved in a murder that initially seems unrelated.  Now here's where the book takes a sharp detour that will delight some readers and frustrate others, depending on how you feel about historical characters mingling with fictional characters.  And some readers will enjoy the introduction of FBI and CIA intrigue, while others will resist the mixture of spy and courtroom genres.<br />However, Fairstein is a masterful storyteller, and she seems fascinated by historical events, especially those related to New York City, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of places like the yacht club.  So when I picked the book up again, after my shock at finding King Farouk's mistress in a courtroom thriller, I found myself absorbed in the story and learning an amazing amount about Egyptian royalty and double-eagle coins.<br />However, I felt cheated!  Who better than Fairstein to deal with the complexity of rape cases with no witnesses?  How does a prosecutor square off against a private attorney? And I wish her adversary had been a better, more experienced lawyer, instead of someone who made basic mistakes in jury selection.<br />Recommended -- but next time, the book jacket needs to warn us what to expect!ienced lawyer, instead of someone who made basic mistakes in jury selection.     <br />Recommended -- but next time, the book jacket needs to warn us what to expect!	2004-02-18

Amazingly, MC Beaton manages to maintain high quality characterization, style and plot. Each novel brings a fresh twist to what is practically a sub-genre: small-town characters who are, well, characters anywhere in the world.  Tom Bodett's End of the Road crew would feel at home.<br />Here we have two plots running parallel. Priscilla's friend Jenny arrives from London, inappropriately dressed and citified, determined to ruffle Priscilla's feathers by romancing Hamish.  Hamish, as usual, is the last to catch on.  I have trouble imagining a smart career woman dashing off to the Scottish highlands on a frivolous mission, but, alas, it's not impossible.  And Beaton defly evokes humor from the contrast between Jenny and the Lochdubh residents, without resorting to silliness and slapstick.<br />Meanwhile villagers receive poison pen letters which seem silly, but nevertheless rouse Hamish's instincts. As other reviewers have noted, Hamish's suspicions are vindicated when the postmistress's suicide turns out to be murder.  Hamish, sometimes aided by his new sidekick (and possible romance) Elspeth, travels around Scotland to gather clues and ultimately solve the case.  The plot twists become fairly complex but remain logical and consistent.<br />As usual, the murder takes second place to the lives of the characters and their misguided alliances.  Hamish doesn't seem eager to settle down with anyone but his dog, Lugs,  and he continues to resist promotion.  Fortunately, we the readers can anticipate  more adventures as  Hamish fends off romance and tangles with his jealous boss.	2004-02-18
US	43879637	R21DEGQGF1FOTH	0375506381	430311429	The Anatomy of Hope: How People Prevail in the Face of Illness	Books	5	33	34	N	N	Scientific Alliance of Mind and Medicine	This book has two types of chapters: narratives (not quite case studies) of specific patients who dealt with serious illness with varying degrees of hope, and Groopman's search for scientific understanding of the emotion we call hope.<br />Groopman describes two patients who refused treatment, one an Orthodox Jewish housewife he met as a medical student, the other a Vietnam veteran who ultimately responded. Two patients maintained hope, despite a depressing prognosis, and one recovered.  He remembers one patient who felt betrayed by her physician's unrealistic optimism.<br />Describing these patients, Groopman shares his frustration: there's a good chance they can be cured, yet at least some of them resist. One physician (not Groopman's patient) insists on aggressive treatment, living fourteen years after initial diagnosis.  &quot;Don't give up!&quot; seems to be the message.<br />Like most physician-writers, Groopman presents cases from a privileged world. All these patients had access to teaching hospitals, presumably without financial worries. All but one had families and careers waiting for them. One reluctant patient had a loyal wife at his bedside. Only the first patient, the housewife in a hostile marriage, had nothing waiting for her.<br />It would be interesting to contrast these patients with others for whom illness represents a financial as well as physical burden. And, given research on social support, I would have expected to see some discussion on the role of the family in maintaining hope. Few people can survive a regimen of chemo and radiation without meaningful support, which is just not available to everyone.<br />I particularly enjoyed the chapters on the science of hope, which can be related to the placebo effect. Groopman warns that optimism will not cure serious illness, but will motivate people to initiate and continue painful, debilitating treatment.  However, he reports evidence that resilient people respond more positively to flu shots, and that some people respond more strongly to placebos than others.<br />Seeking relief from his own back pain, Groopman encountered a specialist who roared, &quot;Don't be ruled by your pain!&quot;  And, as I read, I wondered if care-avoiders -- people who avoid visiting doctors -- may create their own placebo effects and refuse to be ruled by pain.<br />Readers of Groopman's New Yorker pieces may find this book written in somewhat looser style, with more of a first person account than a journalistic report.  Groopman carefully avoids any hint of woo-woo, while appreciating the widening boundaries of scientific discourse.  Overall, he does a masterful job of offering the lay reader access to technical subjects, without sacrificing rigorous thinking.s, and that some people respond more strongly to placebos than others.<br />Seeking relief from his own back pain, Groopman encountered a specialist who roared, &quot;Don't be ruled by your pain!&quot;  And, as I read, I wondered if care-avoiders -- people who avoid visiting doctors -- may create their own placebo effects and refuse to be ruled by pain.   <br />Readers of Groopman's New Yorker pieces may find this book written in somewhat looser style, with more of a first person account than a journalistic report.

As others have observed, we care about the heroine, Rachel Benjamin, and her struggles with the religious world of her family.  And as others have noted, author Abraham maintains suspense, which mainly focuses on whether the parents will find out what Rachel's doing and shut down her spirit.<br />Romance Reader brings home a reality about nearly every strict religion. From the outside, demands can seem strict, petty, and even cruel, especially when members are also outsiders in the larger world.  Because Rachel's father is also a rabbi, the family is expected to adhere even more stringently to the minutiae of religious observance.<br />As I read, I kept thinking of parallels to other religious groups. Rachel wonders why male rabbis should be discussing her choice of clothing, just as many Catholic girls wondered why male clergy get involved in their sex lives.  Jodi Picoult's novel, Plain Truth, shows how Amish culture leads a mother to risk her own daughter's future to maintain a moral code.<br />Romance Reader deals explicitly with dual influences on young members of these communities. Conformity is rewarded with strong doses of social support, understanding and love. But the same closeness also isolates Rachel from her schoolmates and neighbors, denying her opportunities to grow as a person and experience the life she wants.<br />Rachel emerges as a quiet heroine, trying to \\"do the right thing.\\" On a visit to Williamsburg, a religious section of Brooklyn, she reflects that she would be \\"more like Ma wanted\\" if she could live in a community where she wouldn't be different from others around her.  She doesn't fight her religion's rules but she consciously makes choices.<br />The section dealing with Rachel's arranged engagement and marriage is especially poignant. Rachel wants a place she can call her own, sex she can enjoy and work that uses her talents and intellect.  She finds herself paired with a decent but naive man from a very nice family -- someone who's (pardon the pun) no match for her.<br />My favorite sections  described the way Rachel and her sister arranged for lifeguarding lessons so they could earn money and gain some freedom. Why, she wonders, can't her family appreciate what she's doing -- shouldering initiative and responsibility -- instead of worrying about whether she's wearing a bathing suit.  Ultimately, the life she saves turns out to be her own.nds herself paired with a decent but naive man from a very nice family -- someone who's (pardon the pun) no match for her.   <br />My favorite sections  described the way Rachel and her sister arranged for lifeguarding lessons so they could earn money and gain some freedom.

To my amazement, the private \\"alternative\\" university demanded a background check.  I said thanks but no thanks -- and only now do I understand what happened.<br />Lane, author of Naked Employee, explains that companies fear risks associated with loose cannon employees, although he doesn't use those words.  They risk embarrassment, lawsuits and more. And now, when it's so easy to order background checks, why take those risks?<br />If you resist, says Lane, prospective employers won't think you're principled; they'll think you're hiding something.  After all, background checks revealed that fifty percent of resumes submitted to a major search firm included falsified information, ranging from imaginary degrees to exaggerated responsibilities.<br />Once you're hired, you can be subjected to physical exams and ongoing surveillance.  Lane reviews the relative invasiveness of hair, blood and urine tests.  Uniforms can be equipped with devices to prevent theft and track your whereabouts.  Personal phone calls can be monitored long enough to discover they're personal -- a good two to three minutes.<br />As I read this book, I grew more and more horrified.  Lane stays focused on what's happening today, only briefly suggesting ways to frame the problem on a broader scale. For instance, at the very end of the book, he notes that providing health insurance gives employers a solid basis for questioning employee lifestyles, on and off the job.<br />In a much earlier book, JobShift, WIlliam Bridges called for individuals to become independent contractors rather than employees.  He argued that separating health insurance from employment would protect our privacy as well as our physical health.  A paradigm shift, requiring major changes in infrastructure, would be required to alter our relationship with our employers, careers and jobs.<br />Thus the employment relationship has become decidedly lopsided. In return for invasion of privacy, the employer offers no long-term guarantees of employment.  And in at least one non-traditional \\"university,\\" the background checks have become a substitute for hiring: the \\"dean\\" didn't know anything about what was being  taught -- just checked off boxes.

You find yourself saying, \\"Sure -- I can do this!\\"  And, although increasing numbers of women are opening their own businesses, many identify with gender-based guides.<br />The authors focus as much on product as service businesses, and they discuss businesses with employees as well as solo acts.  As a result, they offer a broad base, recognizing that readers must go elsewhere to achieve depth on any one topic.<br />The usefulness of specific guidance varies a great deal. The authors are best when dealing with matters of spirit and attitude.  For example: \\"Keep emotions at home,\\" \\"employees are not friends,\\" and  \\"recite these ten mantras regularly.\\"<br /><br />However, the section on mentoring can be  misleading to a newbie. As a former academic, I had to chuckle when I read (p. 227): \\"Maybe the dean of the business school is a generous and knowledgeable soul who likes nothing more than to give advice to female entrepreneurs.\\"  In my experience, deans give free advice only to those outsiders who are likely to become large-scale donors.  And I haven't met too many business school deans who are \\"generous and knowledgeable souls.\\"  These days, you have to expect to pay for mentors unless you are very, very lucky.<br />So bottom line, I'd recommend reading this book for energy and a \\"let's get going\\" mentality.  You can get the specific how-tos elsewhere.	2004-01-21

I've been a fan of Julia Cameron since The Artist's Way, and this book makes a welcome addition to the series.  Here Cameron focuses on getting past creative blocks: what to do when you feel empty inside. Or, as she writes, &quot;the making of art when we feel we have no art in us.&quot;<br />After you've read Cameron, the narrative sections serve as gentle reminders. The bottom line is always the same: No matter how you feel, get to your workshop and start working! Don't worry about who will respond to your efforts -- just do the work.<br />Cameron is no gentle New Age dreamer. She tolerates no excuses.  There's always something you can do, she says; you can find ten minutes to clean the kitchen each day.<br />And to get moving, she urges a commitment to continuity and structure. Structure might include the famous Morning Pages. They might include your own routine or ritual.  But at the heart of creativity, she implies, is determination and discipline. Behind nearly all overnight successes you will find years of hard work and discouragement.<br />Cameron's exercises will keep anyone busy and productive. As she herself says, each reader makes unique choices when identifying the most helpful exercises.  Some are fairly straightforward, even ordinary (&quot;20 wishes&quot;) and some surprising and insightful (&quot;write about yourself in the third person&quot;).<br />I must admit I sometimes find myself counter-arguing.  Thinking of five situations that unexpectedly worked out well doesn't help me trust the present: I welcome luck but don't encourage anyone to count on it!<br />And I am confused by Cameron's example of exploring positive aspects of a negative situation. When someone criticizes your play, you can make some changes that lead to a better work. All too true -- but some negative situations don't &quot;fix&quot; that easily.<br />I read this book along with Judith Sills's new book, The Comfort Trap.

Books	5	99	101	N	N	Honest talk on a tough subject	Ignore the editorial reviews of this book, which offer only glowing generalities. Comfort Trap  offers the first solid guidance for a challenge faced by many.<br />Safety, says Sills, &quot;limits the amount of satisfaction any experience can deliver.&quot; Yet inevitably, we cling to what feels safe and comfortable.  There's nothing wrong with making do and staying put, Sills hastens to add.  But if your job or relationship aren't going anywhere, you'd better face facts. Avoid reality and your subconscious may take over: you'll make mistakes that catapult you off the horse, ready or not.<br />Facing facts calls for creating a vision and studying your past to see if you have a habit of riding dead horses (or, she might have added, killing anything that starts out half-alive).<br />To her enormous credit, Sills reminds us that delving into the past can create yet another comfort trap.  It is only by taking action, making decisions and facing fear that we can actually find a new horse.<br />To remove yourself, Sills says, calls for discipline, i.e., &quot;the will to get over the wall.&quot;  It is necessary to follow one's mind rather than one's short-term emotions. And, she recommends, create structures to help you reach your goal.<br />Most important, you must have a vision -- you thinking of moving to something rather than leaving the horse behind The vision must be under your control, which leaves out visions like &quot;Make Harry a more sensitive person.&quot;  And the vision must be motivational -- you must be excited enough to get moving.<br />Sills is a psychotherapist who has, she says, worked long enough to know when to question her training.  Yet as a therapist, inevitably she sees clients with relationship rather than career or busines challenges.  Not surprisingly, nearly all of Sills's examples focus on love rather than work.<br />As a career coach, I was drawn to the example of the client who hates the family business but can't earn the same income elsewhere.  Rather than question her client's values (&quot;Do you really need this much money?&quot;) Sills wisely helps the client develop a vision of working constructively for this business.  She creates simple interventions that seem as much like coaching as therapy, e.g., &quot;Start work with that pile of paper. Set an alarm to remind yourself to begin a difficult task.&quot;<br />I would have liked to see more about the way people decide if their horses are really dead. Sills admits that, at some point, you have to &quot;place your bet&quot; with incomplete information.  In the self-help world, authors need courage (and a good editor) to say saying, &quot;There is no checklist.&quot; However, there are times when people have to weigh tradeoffs, especially if they walk away from a career or marriage with tangible benefits that cannot be replaced.  And Sills drops a tantalizing hint when she says, &quot;Sometimes what's dead is you.&quot;  I'd have liked some clarification.<br />Overall, this book offers a new way to think about being stuck and I will be recommending Comfort Trap to everyone who visits my own website.

He does not condone cheating but explores social influences that encourage and reward cheating. Most important, he shows how lines have blurred between cheater and victim.  Many people cheat on auto insurance, he says, but in fact these poorly-regulated insurance companies turn their customers into victims.<br />And the institutions we're taught to trust, such as the medical system, cheat us too. Doctors who join multi-level marketing programs not only prescribe unnecessary products but also try to recruit their patients into a money-making scheme!<br />Callahan focuses on economic pressures that drive ordinary people to cheat, especially &quot;Winner Takes All.&quot; If losing means losing everything, there's enormous incentive to do whatever it takes to win.<br />If anything, Callahan doesn't go far enough. He notes that parents hire &quot;coaches&quot; to help children get into colleges and &quot;tutors&quot; who sometimes do the work for the children.<br />But here's the irony. Many coaches, tutoring services and ghost writers earn more than teachers. Well-paid teachers with a reasonable workload might make their services unnecessary.<br />At one writing conference, a young man openly told a whole table of horrified listeners, &quot;I earn a lot more ghostwriting term papers at the University of X than when I was an adjunct professor at the same university.&quot;<br />Then again, has any culture or civilization ever truly rewarded integrity?

Until his mid-twenties, David presented himself to others as a white Jew.<br />A  gay woman presented herself as straight while serving in the Navy, and a gay man presented himself as straight while studying to be a Conservative rabbi.  A Hispanic woman converted to Orthodox Judaism but had trouble getting accepted by the Jewish community.  A white woman unexpectedly was mistaken for African-American and she wasn't sure how to clarify the confusion. A young male poet wrote under a female pseudonym.<br />Kroeger focuses on philosophical and ethical aspects of passing, rather than the psychological. She accepts the right of others to judge and at times she seems to be judging her own subjects.<br />On page 32, for instance, Kroeger states directly that identity is \\"not a matter of choice.\\"  On page 33, the author suggests, \\"We migh see\\" David's actions as those a \\"young black man willfully engaged in an insult to his black heritage.\\" Or, says the author, we might be \\"amused\\" by his \\"tenuous Jewish connection.\\"<br />First, if David feels closer to his Jewish friends than his \\"black heritage,\\" who are we to judge? Was he insulting his heritage or just being a friend-seeking adolescent?<br />And David's Jewish connection is hardly tenuous. When Madeline Albright's Jewish parentage was made known, media and religious leaders urged her to embrace her roots, although her cultural connection to Judaism was even weaker than David's.  As Kroeger notes, David's mother was Jewish -- a fact that should establishes his identity strongly, not tenuously.<br />Passing suffers from the author's decision to focus on philosophical and ethical issues rather than psychological and sociological perspectives.  Psychologically, Hazel Markus writes of possible selves -- a perfect framework to study these cases.  Other psychologists have studied betrayal. What identity constructions lead to one's friends and family experiencing betrayal?  Are some identity constructions more difficult to accept, e.g., pseudonym as compared to sexual or religious identity?<br />And are all these stories really about one phenomenon?  A gay woman who denies her sexuality (under duress) to keep a job she loves, seems to differ in important ways from someone who has to deal with inaccurate perceptions of her race or someone who feels like a swan who was dropped into a duck's nest by mistake.  The \\"Jane\\" case, a woman using a male pseudonym, doesn't seem to belong at all: the practice isn't that infrequent, and \\"Jane's\\" editor rightly wasn't at all concerned. The \\"Virginia\\" teacher who was mistaken for black seems to have identity management rather than \\"passing\\" challenges.<br />Kroeger recognizes that a need for passing can be based on outdated rules, e.g.,  gays passing for straight in the mlitary. But why does anyone have to \\"pass\\" at all?  Why do we fail to respect those who are born into one culture but feel drawn to another, when we recognize that a man may really belong in a woman's body? Biology can interact with environment to create temperament and disposition. So why can't we accept that the Hispanic woman feels a closer affinity with Judaism than with another heritage?<br />As the 2004 presidential primaries begin, many writers criticize candidates who choose to keep their early lives private.

As other reviewers noted, a young Olivia gets caught up in the drug trade of her hapless boyfriend. Both were naive: he just wanted to make easy money and she never realized what was going on.<br />And both got caught in a net that was obviously set to trap some small fish.<br />This book is not easy to read. It's scary to realize how easily an innocent person can get caught up in the legal system, and how the byzantine system with its &quot;mandatory minimums&quot; and arbitrary definitions end up harming in the innocent.  The federal government spends huge sums to try and imprison these people, while we have no money for drug rehab programs and health care.<br />At one point, Olivia makes an impassioned speech to a judge about the stupidity of the system. Those who are innocent have nothing to offer as a plea bargain because they don't know anything!  And she's right.<br />Waldman does a superb job with characters -- not black and white, just real people with flaws.  However, Olivia's relationship with her mother seems to pale when compared to her confrontation with the law.<br />Between books like Daughter's Keeper and movies like Traffic, one would hope some politicians would wake up and realize we're not winning the war on drugs.  The price of drugs has gone down and the quality is better, says Olivia, a sign that the market has become more efficient and has attracted more customers.  We're just throwing money that might be better used elsewhere.	2004-01-09
US	43879637	RUH8L8BZUH1T4	0399151273	890960277	Retribution	Books	4	4	10	N	N	Escape fiction, intelligent and well-plotted	Other reviewers have recounted the plot: Following her rape, a young law student &quot;Chloe&quot; assumes a new identity and moves to Miami, where she becomes a successful, high-profile prosecutor now known as &quot;CJ.&quot;  When she realizes a high-profile defendant was the man who raped her, C.J.  faces a moral dilemma.Should she excuse herself from the case? Should she seize any opportunity to put him away, on any criminal charge that will &quot;stick,&quot; even if it's not the right one?<br />Hoffman knows how to plot and she moves us along deftly.  She creates atmosphere -- hot streets, tense courtrooms.  Having lived in Fort Lauderdale, I could imagine the heroine's world.  I think I even know her condo complex -- I rented an apartment in a complex with the same name, and there was a condo tower!<br />Retribution is a legal thriller, a member of the genre made famous by Grisham and Fairstein.  We get action and a sense of how the law really works.  The characters are just deep enough to hold our interest.  They're like pawns on a giant chessboard -- and, in the case of Retribution, this metaphor may be chillingly appropriate.<br />Plot keeps the pages turning and Hoffman takes us backstage, to the world of a prosecutor faced with a challenging case. She doesn't shield us.  In one scene, prosecutor CJ &quot;rehearses&quot; a police officer, presenting evidence in court for the very first time.  If this scene grew from Hoffman's memories as a prosecutor, we have yet another reason to be skeptical of the justice system.<br />As other reviewers have noted, the ending seems contrived -- not on the same level as the rest of the book.  To enjoy this book, you have to take a big gulp and accept a major coincidence and a villain whose behavior, described mostly in flashbacks, was not always consistent or credible.<br />Retribution probably won't be discussed at your book club, but it's the perfect book to pack if you're facing a long, miserable airplane ride or a siege in a waiting room.  It's intelligent, well-written escape, cleverly plotted.  I'm looking forward to Hoffman's next!ride or a siege in a waiting room.  It's intelligent, well-written escape, cleverly plotted.

As other reviewers noted, heroine Grace Leshansky has just been released from prison, where she spent 7 years for killing her husband.  As Grace begins to adjust to a new scaled-down life -- her husband had already destroyed her bank account -- she tries to learn more about her father, a gambler whose debts had led to frequent confrontations with &quot;enforcers.&quot;<br />Author Caroline Slate weaves multiple threads in and out, moving us from present to past effortlessly and skillfully. She keeps us interested in the characters . And, most important, she makes us care about characters whose flaws are both serious and obvious.<br />Grace admits she can be gullible -- and she manages to attract some of the best liars on the planet.  Grace's father George, a George Burns wannabe, has earned Grace's love and trust while providing an erratic but eventful home life. Each character embodies a level of complexity rarely found in heroes, let alone minor charactersi<br />After reading the book through, I went back to re-trace some missing parts. All the strands were tied neatly, except for a mention of Grace's &quot;stalking&quot; her grandfatrher: it wasn't clear when she acually did find and follow him.<br />I hope Slate writes more fiction like this one - and gets more publicity and fame, too!  A wonderful, thought-provoking all around &quot;good read.&quot;	2003-12-19

Piper does not mince words. She says at the outset, &quot;Old age is not for sissies,&quot; and she goes on to describe life as an old person in a country designed for the young.  It's an apt metaphor: the old learn a new language and a new terrain.<br />Pipher offers creative solutions that are not always easy, as she herself is the first to admit. Not everyone is equipped to be a caretaker. And as a society we do not have the infrastructure to deal with the challenges that increase daily.<br />Ironically, she notes that having a purpose in life will keep us young longer: the 85-year-old woman with an overaged dependent son may seem indulgent to outsiders, but she has a reason to get up every day.  Yet at the same time, challenging work and respect from the community -- the source of purpose for most of us -- will be denied by a society that worships youth.<br />Pipher seems to be selling us on the importance of caring for the elderly. It's a way our own children will learn respect for the family and for us, she says. Yet many of us will not have children of our own.  Today something like one-third of households have only one member.  Being single or childless is no longer &quot;odd.&quot;  And sometimes a parent disappears from a child's life, only to re-appear in a time of need.  There's no basis for a relationship -- it's not about healing but about building a relationship with a stranger .<br />Pipher does not address these topics, but the thousands of midlife adults who face aging parents will say she's offered more than enough to benefit her readers.	2003-11-28

The perfect book for anyone who loves both dogs and cats. As other readers have noted, the real story belongs to Philip Gonzalez, as we learn how one small dog can transform a human life.<br />Gonzalez, a war veteran, injured in an industrial accident, finds himself broke, isolated and bitter. He doesn't want to leave his apartment until a caring neighbor provides the best mental health remedy: \\"Get a dog. Now!\\"<br />Philip adopts Ginny and, sure enough, they heal each other. Never a cat person, Philip gets drawn to the feline species, literally, as Ginny sniffs out disabled cats and begs Philip to take them home.  He now has a purpose in life and I am delighted to see the success of his books: he feeds dozens of cats and pays their vet bills, day after day.<br />Gonzalez shares his story in a matter-of-fact style, yet he's sensitive and caring. The street cats and dogs deserve a home, he says, just like Ginny.  Meanwhile, he keeps them alive as best he can and shares the love by finding adopters whenever possible.	2003-11-26

For someone who's gifted, Jacobsen's book can bring a sigh of relief and recognition.  &quot;I'm not an ugly duckling after all! I was meant to be a swan.&quot;<br />While some reviewers criticize this book as &quot;elitist,&quot; I find the opposite. Jacobsen doesn't suggest that anyone be exempt from social norms or rules. To the contrary, she shows that the gifted may face a tougher challenge than the less-gifted: they must learn to accommodate to a society as an invisible often-resented minority group.  It's up to each gifted person -- hopefully aided by mentors who can take advantage of &quot;teaching moments&quot; -- to learn to swim. That means adjusting a blunt style of speaking, communicating in a new style and, always, dealing with the loneliness of being &quot;different.&quot;  Gifted people tend to attract envy, not empathy, and they don't always grow into rich and successful adults. Indeed, without recognition early in life, the gifted can become severely depressed, mainly due to isolation.<br />Once you read this book, it's easy to recognize evidence of giftedness in yourself and others, including autobiographical accounts. A combination of characteristics -- sensitivity, high-speed, high-energy -- can appear frustrating to those who don't realize what's going on. Many gifted children get diagnosed as hyperactive, depressed, socially inept and worse.<br />I'm not overfond of pencil-and-paper tests, but Jacobsen offers ways to identify specific areas of giftedness through some simple questions. Readers can ignore this part if they choose.<br />Counselors, career coaches, therapists, managers, guidance professionals -- all should have this book on their shelves.  When they find themselves getting overwhelmed by a gifted client, they need to know what's going on.	2003-11-26

Mystery writers are encouraged to keep the suspense high and to keep torturing the characters. Terreri does this in spades.  Maggie Connors loses everything - money, clients, job, credibility and even (possibly) freedom, when she is arrested on suspicion of murder. And of course her own life is threatened by a distraught former client.<br />Amazingly, author Terreri pulls it off, and the ending manages to be more plausible than one would expect. It's a fast read with interesting characters.  The IRS-agent who's her boyfriend may be a little too good to be true, but that's a minor quibble in anotherwise first-rate mystery.<br />I hope we see a lot more from this author.	2003-11-14

As other readers have noted, the plot is derived from the murder of a professor. A few of Delaney's students decide to enhance their investigative skills by some amateur sleuthing.<br />I thought the plot worked well, although the author follows genre conventions and a serious reader will guess the murderer.  And, as others have noted, the characters are not as deeply drawn as they could be but that's okay in this cozy genre.<br />My only quibbles were the plausibility of the story:  typically, a visiting instructor who's called at the last minute won't get accepted so readily.  Everyone will know she's a third choice and they'll treat her accordingly.<br />And I have *never* seen a department that throws so many parties, after so many years in academia.  But maybe English departments are different from business!<br />The recipes could have been omitted.  It's not a culinary series and there are just a few not-too-spectacular recipes....but what kind of series will this be? Heroine McLeod goes back to the newspaper world, so we'll need a new heroine or a new setting.	2003-11-14

As other reviewers noted, Kate's friend and sometime lover, State Trooper Jim Chopin, asks her to investigate a mysterious death: a man found frozen in an advancing glacier, his cabin burned. And when Kate begins to investigate, her own life and property also (literally) come under fire. The steps of Kate's investigation will appeal to fans of the whodunit genre, with an Alaskan flavor. Kate methodically visits possible suspects, each a source of color and sometimes humor.  The solution of the case left me feeling happily satisfied, an increasingly rare response to books I see these days.<br />Stabenow relaxes and lets us have fun with Kate. At times, the novel's style made me think I was reading a cozy. The author finds humor in Kate's new parenting role, as she learns how to cope with a teenager she has inherited from previous novels. Some of the best scenes involve Kate's relationship with her dog, Mutt, a part-wolf who seems to read Kate's mind.  As usual, the cast of characters holds our attention, with tiny subplots: Kate's best friend gets a visit from a (deliberately) long-lost brother and fourteen-year-old Johnny remains determined to stay with Kate, rather than his blood relatives.  The endings seem realistic, not at all contrived.<br />It is SO nice to pick up a book that doesn't tempt me to skip pages, let alone peek at the ending. This one was a joy to read -- I kept wishing it wouldn't end!	2003-11-09

There's a pattern I find irritating: troubled person flees, undergoes torturous initiations and penances, tries to escape...yawn!  However, Empire of Light is different because we're seeing the cult from an outsider's perspective.<br />And author Czuchlewski can write. I found myself turning the pages, genuinely caring about what would happen to the characters.  If you've got a long miserable airplane flight, tuck this book into your carryon bag. It IS hard to put down.<br />Matthew Kelly's ex-girlfriend, Anna, joins Empire of Light and a cat-and-mouse game ensues.<br />Will Matt give in and join? Will Matt's staunchly Catholic family encourage him? And what secrets in Matt's own family will emerge through Matt's own quest? We learn that Matt's father, a brilliant Columbia U graduate, spent his life as a motorman on the NYC subways -- and eventually we learn why.<br /><br />I gave the book only three stars because after awhile,the plot seemed to be going in circles.  I don't want to give away the story, but at some point, the hero needs to say, &quot;If Anna wants to join the cult., more power to her! I want to get on with my own life.&quot;<br />And my credibility was strained by the vast reach of the cult -- hidden cameras, cars, people available for surveillance...<br />A healhy, smart young man would have friends in his life, especially male friends, who might ask him some thought-provoking questions.  The hero seems to live completely alone, except for his family and this ex-girlfriend.<br />The ending, to me, was unsatisfying, even annoying. I kept wanting to shake the hero and say, &quot;Get a grip!&quot;<br />There is one flashback that may explain a great deal. After his freshman year, the hero gives up an internship with a law firm to spend a summer with Anna in Italy -- giving him a lifetime of memories that can never be replaced. On the one hand, I rejoiced in the hero's decision -- never turn down a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! -- but I also wonder if that wasn't the beginning of the end.

After a hard day's work, men want to be alone; women spend more time with the children.  And it is this tending instinct that keeps a society together and makes individuals healthier.<br />Men and women differ in other ways that influence social interaction, says Taylor. Men's groups are more hierarchical, women's more informational. Married men live longer than single men, and women fare better during times of major crisis, such as the dissolution of the Communist bloc.<br />Another key theme: Nurturing is essential to well-being. A nurturant parent can override genes that would predispose a child toward aggression, depression or other disorders.<br />Much of what Taylor writes will not seem radically new, but cumulatively, chapter to chapter, she builds a case for recognizing the importance of nurturing and the style of interaction known as traditionally female.<br />Because Taylor is a psychologist, rather than sociologist, it's not surprising that she omits suggestions and implications.  Many well-educated  citizens, for instance, resent payments to welfare mothers, yet Taylor's findings emphasize that paying women to nurture their children can save millions of dollars by keeping those children out of the criminal justice system.<br />A sociologist could point out that in fact tending seems to be punished by society. &quot;Nurturant&quot; occupations, such as teaching and social work, typically pay less than more aggressive occupations, such as policing.  In medicine, surgeons make the most while pediatricians and psychiatrists earn the least, on average.<br />Taylor also ignores outliers -- the non-nurturing female and the nurturing male. -- who occupy ambivalent roles in many societies. And while she says that friends will become the most important social relationship, as we move farther from families, I find that friendship bonds often are formed based on family status.  A married but childless woman says, &quot;People my age are having babies!&quot; and I say, &quot;Women my age are getting visits from the grandchildren!&quot;<br />As an academic, Taylor herself anticipates comments on what's working and what's missing, and she has made an exceptionally strong contribution here.  I am recommending this book to readers who want to learn more about stress as well as those who are fascinated by the eternal &quot;how men differ from women&quot; puzzle.important social relationship, as we move farther from families, I find that friendship bonds often are formed based on family status.

Simplified, they argue:<br />(1) Famillies want to live near quality school districts so their children can get good educations, go on to college and be successful;<br />(2) Houses and taxes in those districts cost a lot of money;<br />(3) To make ends meet, the wife takes a job that doesn't just contribute extras -- it puts food on the table; and therefore<br />(4) When the &quot;principal breadwinner,&quot; usually the husband, loses his job or a crisis develops, the family has no safety net.<br />In earlier times, argue the authors, the wife didn't work and the family ran on a single-income budget. So when the wife took a job, her income was new weath, partly replacing a husband's lost income.<br />The authors also point out that families don't get in trouble by spending lavishly on luxuries.  Tucking a baby into the back seat in a wicker basket cost a lot less than a car seat -- but who wants to save on safety?<br />As others have pointed out, the authors leave us readers feeling helpless and frustrated. Public programs that once offered a safety net, such as unemployment, have not been adjusted to today's realities. If you're over forty-five -- and definitely if you're over fifty - you may not get another job if you lose what you have.  The authors suggest that even more families could and perhaps should declare bankruptcy.<br />However, I believe families need to re-examine the need for more and more education. I've attended very fine schools myself and I've seen former classmates competing with graduates of considerably less elegant universities.  A recent Wall Street Journal article identified tycoons who never finished college.  I've seen clients make incredible sacrifices to help their kids, while risking their own comfort and well-being. And I've seen others encourage their children to enter the military for the educational benefits. It's hard to say who's better off.<br />Choosing a good high school is important. However, parents can explore options before mortgaging their lives to the hilt.  Some parents have begun to explore home schooling and to find lower-cost private schools, which might be cheaper than paying taxes on a house in the upper-end districts.<br />And I encourage everyone to start some kind of independent business, at least part-time, at least in a small way. I've met dozens of people who support families by selling Mary Kay and Tupperware.  Others have lawn services.  In the long run, your own business is your best job insurance -- and we need to push for laws that support small business creation.<br />I agree completely with the authors: Don't give up all luxuries! A two-dollar cup of coffee may keep you going while you're cutting back on buying your next car. And I admire the quality of their analysis. But we all need to stop feeling trapped and helpless and begin looking for ways to empower ourselves, even when the odds seem against us.etter off.<br />Choosing a good high school is important.

She's almost a stereotype: wealthy and successful with an unsatisfying, empty personal life.  Coincidentally Claire, the younger sister, has just become engaged to a country singer. Naturally Meaghan's first thought is not to congratulate the bride, but to offer help with the pre-nuptial agreement!<br />Hannah begins by emphasizing the contrast between the sisters. Claire, a party-girl who dropped out of college, versus Meaghan who got a law degree. Claire, simple in the country; Meaghan, sophisticated in the city.  Stereotypically, we're supposed to feel sympathy for Claire and resent Meaghan's heavy-handed intrusions.<br />Meaghan feels guilty about losing touch with Claire, but it's hard to see why. As children, left alone by a self-centered mother who stumbled into a starring television role, Meaghan saved Claire from a foster home with Social Services. It was Meaghan who ended up homeless, who put herself through college and law school.  In the novel, I believe the Meaghan character was more well-rounded and more interesting, with contradictions that led to questions.<br />Following a bizarre episode in a courtroom, Meaghan finds herself with time on her hands. She visits Claire and volunteers to help with the wedding.  Personally, I think attending a bridal shower with *games* is going beyond sisterly devotion, entering the realm of masochism -- a funny and sad scene, marred only by wondering why an experienced sophisticate like Meaghan wouldn't ask ahead of time about dress code.<br />After that the book becomes predictable. I don't want to give away the ending -- which most readers will figure out somewhere early in the book -- but by a series of coincidences, everyone ends up helping everyone else.  A frog...er, bum...turns out to be a prince. And Meaghan becomes transformed. Pre-nup? No way!<br />Of course this book has to follow genre conventions, but I wish we had been exposed to a more complex sisterly relationship (see The Interpreter by Kim for an excellent recent example).  Sure, I kept turning the pages, but it was like finishing up a gooey dessert.  By the end I was ready for a return to meat and potatoes.<br />And what's so unromantic about a pre-nuptial agreement?

I picked up this tapeset from a place where selection was limited -- I admit I would have passed right by in a larger environment.  And I loved it!<br />These women are sharp, intelligent and funny. They're superstars in the self-help world but they're down-to-earth and realistic. And they offer insights that would benefit just about everyone.<br />Now my focus in life is on careers and business -- not sex, food or relationships. But I found myself learning a lot and enjoying what I heard.<br />Example:: Fifty percent of first marriages end in divorce.  (This statistic, which they cite,  may not be accurate but we certainly know that many marriages do end in divorce.) So the question we should ask is not, \\"What's wrong with the divorced partners,\\" but, \\"How does the institution fail in today's world?\\"<br />Example: Food is supposed to be enjoyable -- not a series of prohibitions.  We shouldn't talk about \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" food -- but we are advised to eat from hunger and to question nervous or emotional eating.<br />Example: Sex education focuses on the negatives -- disease and unwanted pregnancy. Why aren't we taught a more positive view of the joyous aspects of sex?<br />I wish the authors would write a book that pulls their insights together. I was surprised when, in answer to a question, they revealed they did not have a synthesis of the relation of these three aspects of life.<br />The second tape covers an interview with the three authors, encouraging them to delve into their own experiences and their own memories of growing up. Suzy Bright offers a hilarious tale of how she converted from Catholic schoolgirl to sex expert.  And while I usually zone out on childhood memory stories, I found myself fascinated by the way each woman grew and changed and dealt with her own family.<br />A great companion for a long trip. I listened twice and plan to return.	2003-09-16

With each book in the Appalachian folk series, McCrumb has moved closer and closer to history and has integrated more and more characters with the Sight, as well as the object of their Sightings.  In my opinion, Rosewood Casket was a flawless balance, with each character rendered three-dimensionally and the supernatural touches deft and light. Frankie Silver and Songcatcher were close.<br />I wouldn't miss anything by McCrumb, but here I get the feeling she was pushing herself to a new level and at the same time covering some of the same ground. Because she sets the scene in the same place as earlier novels, we meet the old familiar characters, such as Nora Bonesteel and Spencer Arrowood. In Ghost Riders they make cameo appearances, almost dropping in to say hello to their old friends, the readers.<br />And the Ghost Riders are not at all subtle. They're seen by those who have the Sight and by those who are close to dying. I didn't get a sense that they were dangerous or even particularly scary. Nora Bonesteel's visions were tame compared to what went before.<br />And, for the first time in McCrumb's books, the historical scenes become more vivid than the present.  We get a sense of the complexity of the Civil War and the ironies of who fought where.<br />McCrumb delivers another success -- well worth picking up and reading, though not quite as deep, and definitely not as lyrical as some of its predecessors.  And I am already awaiting the author's next book...will she continue with the ballads or give us another chapter of the McPhersons?<br />Either way, I'm ready!	2003-09-16

She turns out two books a year -- one in each series -- and each offers a fresh plot and a new twist to old characters.<br />As other reviewers have noted, a beautiful new curate comes to Agatha's village in the Cotswolds. Agatha is flattered when he asks her to dinner, but soon realizes he has shown a general interest in wealthy women.<br />When the curate is murdered, suspicion falls on the<br />vicar, who had been displaced in his flock's affections by the charismatic young man.  And Agatha can't resist taking off to solve the mystery.<br />I have to agree that in some ways, this book does not sparkle as earlier volumes did -- but partly that's because we've gotten to know the character. She's really settled into her cottage with her cats and there aren't too many facets of her character left for us to understand.<br />The author needs to bring in some new characters who can be foils for Agatha Raisin's unique personality. Her on-and-off romance with James Lacey worked because Lacey was, in his way, an interesting character. Here she teams up with a detective story writer who moved next door and he just isn't sharp enough to share the stage.<br />That being said, I loved this book, as i've enjoyed every single one in the series. I think it's time for Agatha to embark on something totally different. Perhaps a distant relative could send her a child or teenager to look after for awhile. Perhaps she could undertake psychoanalysis or a religious retreat.  She's tough and domineering and she needs a worthy opponent to keep sharp.	2003-09-16

They may look alike in uniform, but Lipsky reveals their unique personalities.<br />Lipsky has a journalist's ear for dialogue. We imagine George Rash's nervous verbosity and Captain Pardes's no-nonsense commands. We hear cadets gripe and we also hear their pride in themselves and the institution. We learn how a woman can be  feminine and a soldier.<br />We get a sense of how the Black cadets feel like the Fifth Regiment.<br />Lipsky raises some tough questions. What motivates young men and women, all of whom had options, to come here? What keeps them going? And why do they seem so much happier than students at Ivy League and other selective universities? After all, their time is rationed, dating options are limited, they're walking the area or staying in their rooms for niggling infractions, and the coursework is far from easy.<br />I wish he'd gone a little deeper in probing for answers, perhaps talked to some experts outside West Point. Part of the reason cadets are happy is that they were selected for ability to adapt. Nearly every cadet was outstanding in some arena before he or she arrived. They captained varsity sports, aced their exams and SATs, led JROTC battalions and a whole lot more.  Additionally, they're healthier than average, both mentally and physically.<br />Lipsky focuses considerable attention on the ill-fitting cadet, George Rash, and offers a balanced account.  On the one hand, a young man who tries so hard, and who actually makes the grade in many situations, deserves to continue. On the other, if he fails later, the Academy may lose some luster -- and he'll be out there, commanding troops.<br />This book makes a fine contribution to the literature of West Point, offering glimpses into a life that most of us will never see first-hand.	2003-09-16

Bruce Elkin seems like a terrific person and coach. The strongest reason to buy the book is that you're getting ideas that are drawn from Elkin's own life and coaching practice, not from a canned program.<br />The most useful idea comes right at the beginning: Think of creating instead of problem-solving.  Problem-solving brings temporary relief. Creating changes your life. Elkin challenges the &quot;clear clutter&quot; advice we get so often and encourages us to look at what we really want in our lives.<br />He offers examples drawn from his coaching practice, such as the woman who created a house for herself on a shoestring budget.  Some of the best sections included real-life examples, such as the &quot;slightly rednecked&quot; man who found a way to get what he wants without spending big bucks.<br />Elkin writes about his own search out of a career that, he says, was surviveable only with antidepressants and beer.  Interestingly, he found his new path in the usual way: by serendipity and by being open to what was out there. Looking back thirty years, his path seems straightforward, but I suspect there were a lot of twists and turns along the way.  And I'd like to hear more about the identity shift that would have gone along with the career change.<br />The sections on creativity and creative tension are especially well done. That part could be strengthened and expanded into an entire book. The analogies between creating a work of art and creating a life, and the difficulties of going from one to the another, are superb.<br />I recommend reading this book a little at a time.  I would have liked to see more exercises and suggestions for actually doing what Elkin suggests.<br />This book would have been strengthened by focusing on a single theme, such as &quot;Simplicity and success: managing the duality.&quot;  Or &quot;From problem-solving to creation.&quot;  And while I applaud Elkin's ability to resist hype, we need more startling &quot;Wow!&quot; moments, especially in the chapter headings. Some headings are quite banal and I was tempted to skip with a &quot;been there, done that.&quot;  However, often the material under the headings was quite new.<br />I would also like to see more stories of real or composite clients to illustrate Elkin's points. Following one couple through a transition can be very effective -- but not everyone will relate to that couple.<br />The weakest section of the book comes in the implementation chapter. We are encouraged to work backwards: Think of a goal. And what would you need ... and what would you need for that...  That's not really new and it's a lot harder than it looks.  And sections on avoiding negativity offer little that's new, although they're presented with uniqueness and insight.<br />I hope Bruce Elkin continues to write and develop his ideas.

If they expected to win, would they have assigned a more senior, experienced, media-savvy DA?<br />We'll never know. But, as Clark points out in several places, police, judge and prosecutors gave OJ unique advantages. He appeared at the \\"site visit\\" unencumbered by chains and the judge may have been awed by the status of the defense lawyers.<br />Regardless, Clark \\"caught\\" the case and she wanted it.  I don't think she wanted glory. She wanted a challenge.  And she makes sure we understand she wasn't given the resources to meet that challenge effectively.<br />Clark didn't have control of the courtroom. For example, a media consultant gratuitously offers to \\"help.\\" His insights, Clark says, were useless.  Yet he gets a seat at the courtroom table, thanks to Clark's boss.<br />And unlike private lawyers, Clark had limited options for co-counsel.  She was assigned a \\"partner\\" who was competent but not strong -- he was out sick every time a tough witness came up.<br />Some reviewers say Clark used this book to excuse herself. To some extent, that's true. She does come across as strident and even whiny in places.<br />However, she does have something to whine about.  She had only two months to prepare for trial -- circumstances totally beyond her control. She didn't have a chance to get close to the victims and they didn't want her to. The Browns had depended on OJ for money so naturally their feelings were mixed.<br />After reading books by OJ jurors, I suspect Marcia Clark misunderstood the effects of jury stress and failed to read the jurors' body language. She writes that the jury didn't seem to be paying attention -- yet  the Simpson jurors were treated like prisoners themselves, subject to random search and little outside stimulation.  Some were literally going mad.<br />There are numerous first-hand accounts of jurors who say, in deliberations, \\"I don't care how this comes out. I want to go home.\\" I can't help wondering if the OJ jurors shared those feelings.<br />Of course, there's no doubt that OJ's resources allowed him to challenge police evidence that typically would be ignored.  And Clark herself admits she ignored focus groups that suggested jurors just didn't like her style.<br />Whatever the story, Clark landed on her feet, her privacy gone but a new career awaiting her.

Sheriff Brady is called to the scene of a woman's murder. Detectives discover seventeen dogs in the woman's house, all of whom suffocated to death. The dead woman turns out to be Carol Mossman,  who has held a series of low-paying inconsequential jobs before ending up in this trailer owned by her grandmother.<br />Jance, a seasoned best-selling author, plays fair with the readers while delivering a page-turner. We look over Sheriff Brady's shoulder as she investigates. Two newswomen were murdered in the same style: is a serial killer loose? What was Mossman trying to keep quiet? And what is the role of her definitely<br />dysfunctional family?<br />Although the mystery holds attention, the real action takes place in Sheriff Brady's personal life. By marrying her off to a novelist who does the housework, author Jance has avoided the fate of most married detective heroines: losing their edge. Husband Butch cooks great meals and raises teenage daugher Jenny, while her mother continues to disapprove of whatever Sheriff Brady does, on or off the job.<br />And early in the book, Joanna Brady gets a surprise that will create interesting subplots in volumes to come.<br />Jance's novel goes down as smooth as a good scotch. She's a real pro even when she delivers a searing message. As a dog-lover, she must have had a hard time writing about the way dogs suffer, and it's not surprising that the Brady household acquires more dogs during hte course of the action. I think the author's heart was touched as much as her heroine's.<br />I'm not surprised by the number of women who appear here: a female sheriff, a minister, and more.  It's not uncommon to experience women in those roles. By creating a superman husband, Jance allows her heroine to focus on her sheriff role, bypassing traditional female obligations.<br />The characters don't have the staying power of other heroines, such as Anna Pigeon or Bennie Rosato. The focus is on action, no-nonsense and get-the-job-done. This approach may be anchored in the author's southwestern roots, where tough women work on ranches, ride horseback and do their jobs. Jance herself comes across as tough and straight-shooting (I saw her sign books in Tucson). Sandra Day O'Connor is cut from the same cloth.<br />Heroine Joanna Brady would probably find a soul sister in Shirley McClintock, heroine of the series by B. J.

She doesn't share the bitterness of some of the OJ jurors, probably because she was reasonably well-treated. Her employer continued to pay her full salary. She was free to go home and to work at her job during breaks.<br />In a way this book is a testament to the stress imposed on an ordinary, upbeat juror, because Ms Thornton began keeping a journal to deal with her own pressures. Yet she comes through as a cozy female figure. I was surprised to realize she's only thirty-six as her attitudes suggested someone in their forties or even fifties.<br />What comes through is that Ms Thornton admired Leslie Abramson (who's well worth admiring!) and was swayed by evidence of the brothers' abuse.  Her description of the male comments are disheartening and I'm impressed with her ability to keep perspective.<br />Wrightsman's comments, as a legal psychologist, add depth and context to Thornton's account. However, like most researchers, he focuses on juries as instruments in the justice system.  We still need research on the jury experience itself. For instance, everyone gets concerned about bias -- but a juror's reasoning process can be altered by mood and social environment.  And we could use some research on what jury service does to a juror's life.	2003-08-27

Greenspan's book deserves wider recognition. I found it by accident online and I wish I had seen it earlier.<br />What I liked best: Greenspan writes from her own experienced as therapist and bereaved mother, a woman who came to the US as a young child and lost her first child due to unexplained brain defects.  She knows the darker emotions first-hand.<br />Even better, Greenspan is not afraid to confront the received wisdom of the psychiatric establishment. Medication works for some depressed clients, but it is only by going into the emotion that we can transform despair into faith and fear into joy.  She picks up on the values embedded in the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria: depression is a &quot;mood disorder,&quot; which means that only cheerful, upbeat people are &quot;normal.&quot;<br />I found myself making notes of key points that were unusual and insightful. In particular, her discussion of &quot;boomerang emotions&quot; will be especially valuable to anyone who's ever been frustrated in one area and acted out in another.  It is easy to make impulsive, often dysfunctional decisions after stifling feelings for a long time.  This section is one of the best in the book.<br />On the downside, I wish Greenspan had been more rigorous. Although her views seem sensible, some research suggets disagreement. For example, one study found that people recovered from grief as well if they were medicated as if they were allowed the full experience. Other studies have demonstrated that people experience grief differently. Some may not need to go deep into the feeling.<br />Because Greenspan works with therapy patients, she does not discuss the context of these &quot;dark&quot; emotions. Despair can be experienced by someone like William Styron, whom she discusses, as a person who seems on top of the world. But would there be a different experience of despair for someone who just lost a job, has little chance of finding a new job, anticipates old age and perhaps has family stresses too?  Despair rooted in real obstacles seems somehow different from despair that has more existential &quot;why are we here&quot; origins. And biologically based depression seems to be different altogether.<br />Many New Age and popular authors (such as best-selling author Lynn Grabhorn) make exactly the opposite point: if you force yourself to be upbeat, your life gets better.  I wish Greenspan had addressed this point directly, as some people do seem to do better after forced cheerfulness. This topic may not be amenable to scientific research but it would be nice to see some science-based discussion.<br />Finally, I wish Greenspan had stated her credentials on the book jacket. Is she a PhD? Does she have degrees? Has she published articles in academic or research journals? I was a little disconcerted by the discussion of chakras in a book by a more-or-less mainstream therapist.<br />Then again, Greenspan seems to be making a statement. She doesn't like the way we treat the darker emotions. And maybe she doesn't like the way therapists are categorized and pigeon-holed either.  After all, there's no research (as far as I know) demonstrating that certain training results in better therapeutic outcomes.  Definitely worth a read.tresses too?

She offers the standard party line and she's best at the basics. For instance, judges can't be too friendly to the jurors and attorneys can't speak to the jurors at all.  There's a decent chapter on jury nullification but I suspect judges are a little harsher than she suggests. .<br />However, Stanley glosses over the serious problems associated with jury service. As she says, a juror's identity can be recognized and jurors are subject to media follow-up. She says nothing about the more serious hazards, such as retaliation by the parties to the case or the possibility of serious emotional disturbance.The courts leave it up to the jurors to provide for their own protection, at their own expense.<br />In this way jury duty differs from military service, with which it is often compared. When men were drafted into the army, they did get compensation (although not much) for injury, both mental and physical. And some receive life time medical benefits.<br />Stanley does not acknowledge that controversy exists over the value of jury duty, especially in civil cases. And she describes the procedures without comment. For example, jurors can be asked questions to assess bias -- but studies have shown uselessness of many of these questions. Nor does she point out that some people are unlikely to be selected because of their education, background, or attitudes, yet they have to appear and go through the motions, over and over again.<br />As Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor notes, juries were created eight hundred years ago. Today's rules for jurors still draw on assumptions that no longer make sense. And the US demands more of jurors than most other countries in the world -- perhaps more than any country because voir dire is so elaborate.	2003-08-27

Being a junior assistant means embarking on a series of scavenger hunts to make the great woman's life easier or at least more amusing.<br />Sure it's a light-hearted chick book. Andrea toils in a pink collar ghetto, courted by big-budget advertisers and fashion houses.  She rides around in chauffeured town cars, gets to wear high-fashion clothes and meets famous people. In return she works eighteen-hour days and runs around on meaningless errands.<br />Miranda sends her off to find a restaurant but conveniently forgets to mention that it's in Washington, not New York. She tells Andrea to find \\"Madeleine,\\" who could be anyone, anywhere.  Miranda's assistants are terrrified to ask for clarification.  Instead, they spend hours -- and thousands of dollars -- on inept detective work.<br />Sure, it's a year-long version of hell week, but it's also an initiation into a world that will pay dividends throughout Andrea's working life.

I think she goes along with the program and handles herself amazingly well.<br />And while the book could be shorter -- by the tenth torment we get the picture -- Andrea's job isn't all that unusual for a probationer entering a competitive world. Read Billable Hours and Liars Poker: highly paid legal and financial newbies spend hours doing what amounts to clerical work and round-the-clock devotion is the norm.  And it's hard to argue they're serving humanity.<br />I wish Andrea's parents and friends had left her alone to finish her year.  Andrea's boyfriend is a nurturing-type schoolteacher -- a gender bender relationship -- and her father is a therapist. Neither understands the demands of high-power corporate jobs.  Few organizations would offer compassionate leave for a friend's accident, and the circumstances leading up to the accident don't inspire sympathy.<br />Comparisons to Nanny Diaries can be misleading. True, Nanny Diaries seems shorter and tighter, yet a nanny job leads nowhere. It's just a way for a desperate college girl to survive so putting up with a crazy boss has little value.<br />Here, Andrea embarks on a career. Hanging out with the elite in any field gives you access that you can't get any other way, even if you change fields.  Nannies serve time; Andrea undergoes initiation.<br />In a brief \\"what happened next\\" chapter, Andrea benefits from her eleven months at Runway, just as the lawyer in Billable Hours admits he needed his affiliation with a big-name firm to get his next job.

This is a tribute to Ayelet Waldman's skill as a writer as well as her likeable heroine.<br />The ending is pretty easy to guess (well, except for the exact villain, and by the end it didn't matter which of two or three possibles was  actually guilty).  The  heroine remains charming -- the kind of person you'd want to know as a neighbor, a &quot;normal,&quot; unglamorous mom on the edge of the Hollywood scene.  The plot elements actually seem a little stale: true/false memories, rehab center with psychiatrist who's a little too cozy with his patients, cult, ex-hippies with names like Polaris and Jupiter.<br />Still, I read the book all the way through and I never once felt the urge to pull out the blue pencil and second-guess the writer or the editors.  And we get some comic relief with vignettes of  family life from the mommy perspective.  Juliet's children are typical little terrors. Her husband, Peter, is almost too good to be true.<br />This is a cozy mystery, deftly plotted, perfect for an escape, by a real pro.  With fresher plot ingredients and a little more character depth, would be five stars.	2003-08-11

One of Scottoline's best -- my third favorite after Everywhere That Mary Went and Mistaken Identity.<br />With each book in this remarkable series, each of four women lawyers seems to take turns being lead character. While Mary's character was well-developed in Everywhere that Mary Went -- first in the series -- Bennie emerges as the strongest, most complex and most puzzling.<br />Bennie Rosato's all-woman law firm is close to bankruptcy when, out of the blue, a plaintiff introduces the firm to the world of class action suits.  When the plaintiff is murdered, Bennie questions the police explanation (second in a series of attacks on visiting foreigners), focusing on her fellow lawyers who are competing for a piece of the large class action pie.<br />Rosato meets the deceased man's family -- all elegantly French and wealthy, including Julien, the stepson graduating Harvard with MBA-JD degrees.  While looking for the murderer, she fends off attacks by her twin sister, with the help of a great-looking SEAL on leave, and she deals with the firm's troubled finances with the help of a gay lawyer friend Sam. And the firm's lone secretary -- all Bennie can afford now -- is very, very pregnant.<br />There's a lot going on, but it works.  Bennie bounces around from one crisis to the other and Mary even brings in a lawsuit on behalf of neighbors descended from Italians interned in World War II.  Judy and Anne appear in cameo roles: Judy's hair is dyed pink and Anne, a Stanford graduate, isn't afraid to use her stunning good looks to advantage.<br />In every book, Scottoline takes us to the edge of what's plausible. Could an amateur like Rosato take on a class action lawsuit? How could a famous lawyer allow her firm to fall into deep financial distress, a breath away from bankruptcy?  Two of the \\"young associates\\" have quite a bit of experience: in Scottoline's first book, Mary and Judy had just made partner at the esteemed white-shoe firm of Stallings and Webb.  Don't they want to be partners?<br />However, I've heard Scottoline speak and I believe everything she narrates could happen. Not likely, but just possible.  Scottoline is fascinated by twins: she's a twin and her characters Mary and Bennie are twins.  The subplot may stretch our credibility -- but Ann Rule's true crime books have shared even weirder family histories.<br />Scottoline's best at plot and scene. She lovingly evokes Philadelphia and I feel like I'm right in court with Bennie. There are many characters competing for attention and some fade into the background, more outshadowed than ignored. Scottoline's humor is sharp and subtle: I loved the scenes where Bennie's clients complimented the associates on the very qualities that drove Bennie crazy.<br />And Bennie's dog is very, very real.<br />I for one couldn't put this one down. Professional and classy, like the author and her heroines.y want to be partners?<br />However, I've heard Scottoline speak and I believe everything she narrates could happen.

As a fanatical fan of the Anna Pigeon series, I was ready to read just about anything Nevada Barr wrote. The book's subtitle promises to record Barr's spiritual &quot;path&quot; and the title of &quot;hat to hat&quot; suggests a charming theme. The LC Cataloging-in-Publication assigns this book to &quot;biography.&quot; Yet we get not a path, but a series of unrelated thoughts. You have to stretch to call this book biography. And hats appear only in the introduction and a rather forced conclusion.<br />I must admit I was hoping for a narrative story, as befitting a novelist who creates magnificent plots, believeable 3D characters and, above all, scene and place.  Instead, we get a series of unrelated musings that could have been written by almost any decent writer.  There's a bit of humor, as when Barr asks to be confirmed,  although she doesn't accept Jesus as her personal savior, and the priest agrees. Yet in the end we're served a fairly standard helping of,  &quot;I sinned, I saw the light, here's what I believe now.&quot;<br />There's a tantalizing glimpse into Barr's life, when she says she'd rather be a tiger's lunch than a conforming member of a pod.  And we learn she's experienced depression, addiction, betrayal, joblessness and more.  Yet there's no sense of how she put the pieces together to arrive not only whole, but wildly successful.<br />I was interested to learn that all the experts agree on two keys to relieving depression: exercise and service. Nothing new about exercise -- but what type of service does Barr take up?  Not everyone is cut out for standard volunteer options. Some folks are better off making pots of money and donating so that others might serve hands-on.<br />Of course Barr writes well, although there's less style evident here than I would have expected. Yet we have to acknowledge that an unknown author probably could not have gotten this book published by anyone -- certainly not  a major house like Putnam.  When we buy a brand name, we don't want to be served generics.  I'm waiting for Barr to write the real story of her life...but I can't help wishing she'd put energy of writing this book into another Anna Pigeon story.<br />Only Nevada Barr can write those wonderful mysteries.

However, if anything, this book was higher in quality than the later Solano novels, combining fast, upbeat tempo with a three-dimensional heroine.<br />I was drawn to the larger-than-life Navarro family, defined by their gambling style (everyone aced the SAT's in math because they've been calculating odds since they could talk).<br />After seeing an apparition, the Navarro family matriarch convenes four of the five grown children, each decorated with the name of a jewel, to search for the missing youngest child, Diamond.  Esmerelda quickly rises to the challenge, flying to Las Vegas to search for her much-loved beautiful younger sister.<br />When her limo driver identifies himself as a retired NYPD detective, Esmerelda realizes she's gotten lucky. She follows clues and her own instinct as she learns about how Diamond lived just before she disappeared. A sudden interest in her Cuban roots? A tendency to religion? A possible involvement with criminal activity?<br />Thanks to wealthy parents, Esmerelda plays detective from the vantage point of a luxury hotel. In the end she draws on what she and her family know best: the gaming tables.<br />As she detects, Esmerelda also discovers herself as she learns to depend on herself in a new environment. She enjoys a brief escape from a troubled marriage and three loveable but demanding school-age sons.  And she's too smart to accept, without question, a series of coincidences, beginning with the incident that set her on this quest in the first place.<br />True, Garcia-Aguilera does leave a few threads hanging. As another reviewer noted, she gets confused about dates and ages of her characters. Another plot element (I won't give it away!) remains a mystery, since every luxury highrise in Miami comes with alarm systems that could guard Fort Knox.<br />Most of all, any woman who can dodge the Las Vegas mob is perfectly capable of figuring out what to do with a dog while she's away. We're treated to a graphic description (mercifully brief) of the poor animal's digestive upsets and the husband's understandable frustration. Can't the well-heeled Navarros pay for his stay in an upscale kennel? Some services would even drop off the dog and pick him up.<br />Ms. Garcia-Aguilera should consult equally delightful mystery writers Carol Lea Benjamin and Susan Conant.<br />And Harper-Collins -- a very fine house -- slipped up on the dust jacket, identifying Esmerelda as the oldest and most sensible of the siblings. Between the covers, she's the middle child who combines commonsense with availability: sister Ruby, a lawyer, was getting ready to start a trial.<br />Minor quibbles!

WIth a bit of help from a superior officer, he's off the duty roster and heading for Swansea with his fiance, Bronwen.  The couple visits both sets of parents, starting wtih Evan's mother, an overly concerned soul who sends her love through her cooking.<br />Coincidentally, Tony Mancini is arrested for the murder of a young lady from Swansea. Tony already served time for shooting Evan's father, which he claimed was accidental. Evan begins to wonder if Tony really did murder Allison and, going out on a limb, begins to investigate.<br />Evan's investigation keeps the pages turning. Bronwen gets involved because she looks young and young people will talk to her like an equal.  The ending is a little disappointing, as the motive seems to echo other novels of recent years.<br />And it's not too hard to guess the ending.<br />As usual, Bowen serves up vivid descriptions of Wales and sets a lively pace.  However, by moving the action south, we lose some local village charm. And the horror of complying with requirements to prevent the spread of foot-and-mouth disease casts a disturbing shadow on an otherwise light-hearted novel.  Then again, in real life, this disease cast a shadow on this otherwise delightful world.	2003-07-28

Reading this book is like munching on cake -- homemade cake, not too sweet, with just the right amount of icing.  The pages turn quickly and you begin to relax and feel good about the world.  And you're tempted: can you get another piece later?<br />The book's opening is a winner. Ruth, attending a stress clinic, encounters the common exercise to take yourself to a safe place. She has trouble at first but soon realizes her safe space is right inside a warm Bundt cake. Makes me hungry just thinking about it!<br />Ruth's life is about baking cakes -- from scratch. She bakes to relax. She bakes to win friends. She bakes -- well, to bake!  And ultimately baking is what saves her and her family batches of trouble. Her husband's job disappears in a merger. Her father, wrists broken, comes to stay awhile. Her daughter is being a typical teenager.  And under the same roof is her mother who hisses and spits like a cat at the sight of her ex-husband, Ruth's father.<br />Now, Ruth realizes, she really needs those stress classes. Instead, she finds inspiration from her father's physical therapist, a character the dust jacket compares to Cheryl Richardson, and her father himself.<br />Ruth begins a new venture and that's where the book gets a little heavy on the icing.  Ruth is immensely gifted, but talent is not enough, whether you're a baker or a writer. Miraculously, everyone in Ruth's family -- as well as the helpful physical therapist -- contributes a skill or connection to the enterprise.<br />Plausible? Yes. The author of Girls with the Grandmother Faces published her first book with the help of her family, around her own kitchen table.  Lucky? Also yes. In some families the parents would be whiny wet blankets, the daughter a teen pregnancy waiting to happen and the college-age son a delinquent.<br />I must admit I'm a little biased against books that present starting a business as nearly effortless. However, sometimes you want to enjoy a cake and forget the calories. And sometimes you want to enjoy a well-written feel-good story where the fairy godmother is a composite of most of the folks in the heroine's life and it takes six months, not a wave of the wand, to move the reader to a happy ending.ories.

There's his beautiful wife Patricia, a former model; Heather, a reasonably attractive junior manager and one-time romantic interest; and Erica, the only person in the office who actually reads the daily tax report from cover to cover every day.<br />Erica, the strongest, wields the most influence. A brusque, unattractive woman, she nevertheless wins Mitch with her intelligence and attention to detail. Although she's direct to the point of rudeness, I admire her style. \\"I won't bond with you,\\" she says to a total stranger who begins sharing PMS stories in a hallway.<br />At the same time, I think the book could be at least fifty pages shorter. Multiple viewpoints don't bother me -- but we learn far too much about everyone's personal and past life, in excruciating detail. Patricia and Mitch have two sons who are unattractive in uninteresting ways. One of the cops has an animal-loving wife; the other seeks romance while living with his mother. Enough, already!<br />Although the book gets shelved with mysteries, it's really more of a car chase, with computers instead of cars. I didn't really understand why Mitch was so eager to follow Erica's lead. True, he was getting bored with his life, but he had more than enough resources to move. He became more and more passive as the book wore on.<br />Nor did I really see what Erica wanted or why she needed Mitch. Granted, he was a good lover who accepted her unique physical quirks, but she was perfectly capable of starting a new life on her own.<br />Then again, perhaps the book ultimately is about being unappreciated in one's world. Erica is vastly overqualified for her job and Mitch's partners urge him to find a more attractive junior manager. Patricia's beauty and competence are unappreciated, at least by her husband. Tony, one of the cops, has a last straw moment when cops take credit for his success.<br />There's also a subtheme of being put upon. Both Patricia and Erica find themselves responding to rude comments from strangers.

She finds parallels in her classroom, in the mystery she's hired to solve and in the reading she assigns her teens.<br />This tightly written book deftly weaves together several subplots: Amanda's job at Philly Prep, where she has learned to manage her wimpy headmaster; Amanda's classroom, where she teaches Lord of the Flies with creative, contemporary techniques; Amanda's romance with C.K. Mackenzie and the impending descent of the inlaws; and most important, Amanda's foray into private investigation, under Mackenzie's supervision, which furnishes the main plot driver.<br />Hired to investigate a wealthy man's prospective bride, Emmie, Amanda and C.K. quickly learn the woman has a dark and complex past.  Their investigation moves with lightning speed when Amanda coincidentally meets Emmie's old friend, Vicki. When Emmie realizes she has been investigated, she insists there's another side to the story, albeit a rather implausible one.<br />When Amanda finally figures out the real truth, we readers are treated to a delightful scene where we gain a new appreciation for Amanda's future mother-in-law.  True, there are some coincidences that move the plot, but the book offers what cozy mystery readers want: a fast read, not too much danger, interesting characters, and some deeper points to ponder.<br />The pace and polish of this book show the author continues to grow and move her skills to the next level.  I hope Amanda's marriage doesn't slow her down.  And while I enjoyed the classroom scenes, I can't help wishing Amanda would find a more fulfilling, better-paying career. She's too smart to toil in underpaid anonymity under the supervision of an incompetent Headmaster Havemeyer.	2003-07-21

While books like Jarhead become best-sellers, this<br />well-written account of a female navy pilot has remained<br />hidden from the mass market. And that's our loss.<br />Loree Draude Hirschman, daughter of a Marine general,<br />joined the aircraft carrier Lincoln as an S-3 pilot, and thereby made history. That year the Lincoln was the first West Coast based ship to depart with an integrated male-female crew. Hirschman flew jets off the deck of the carrier and brought them back -- a test of skill and professionalism. And she describes, in detail, life aboard a carrier, where the frustrations come more from living under a microscope than from battling with the enemy.<br />She probably pays more attention to details a woman would notice -- and enjoy reading about. For example, pilots work crazy hours, yet the mess officer was adamant that no cereal would be distributed after 10:30 AM!  Four women in a cramped stateroom have to work to get along, especially when one brings her &quot;boyfriend&quot; home, in defiance of the rules.<br />Hirschman was ideally suited for her role. She knew how to be one of the boys and she genuinely enjoyed navy life. She has moments of doubt and despair, but overall she cares about her crew and manages to make a tough situation seem easy. I suspect she left only when her husband became medically disqualified; otherwise she'd probably be on her way too becoming an Admiral.	2003-07-10

As other reviewers have noted, this book is not an in-depth analysis of legal issues. Rather it's an attempt to provide an informal, backstage glimpse into life on the Supreme Court from the perspective of the first woman justice.<br />Some of her points will loom large with women who, like me, were &quot;firsts&quot; on a much smaller scale. For instance, she notes the significance of changing the nameplates from &quot;Mr. Justice...&quot; to simply &quot;Justice...&quot;<br />As we might expect from a down-home woman who was brought up riding horses in Arizona, O'Connor remains modest and matter-of-fact.  She recognizes her role and the respect she deserves. She describes the difficulties of women in the law, frankly and without self-pity, and acknowledges the preference for sharing experiences with other women in law.<br />And her behind-the-scenes glimpses reflect her perspective as a woman who cares about people as well as principles. She shares wonderful anecdotes about Thurgood Marshall. And she says absolutely nothing about Clarence Thomas, even when discussing the process of confirmation to the Court.<br />In my favorite chapter, Justice O'Connor raises strong, provocative questions about jury duty. Established 900 years ago, she says, the concept remains sound but the implementation is due for an overhaul. Why shouldn't jurors take notes? Why should they be subjected to long waits in uncomfortable rooms? And jurors surely deserve better compensation, she says.<br />O'Connor compares US juries with those of other English-speaking countries -- England, Canada, and Australia. She notes that other countries do not send civil cases to juries as frequently, so jurors do not have to sit through days and weeks of complex testimony that leaves them so bewildered they may as well flip a coin.  (Actually a coin flip would be fairer than trying to sort through half-remembered facts!)  And lawyers spend so much time psyching out jurors they want to challenge that jury selection can take weeks. In Europe, says O'Connor, juries are selected in minutes!<br />If anything, Justice O'Connor doesn't go far enough. Paying for jury service won't help a self-employed or sales person who could lose an account worth thousands of dollars. And jurors often experience serious emotional symptoms following a difficult case.<br />However, it is refreshing to hear such honesty from a distinguished member of the legal profession. O'Connor even recalls the New Yorker cartoon where a jury foreman tells the judge, &quot;We find the defendant guilty and sentence him to jury duty.&quot;  So true! I'm told that some juries begin to identify with criminal defendants -- they're treated in more or less the same way!<br />If you know someone who's called for jury duty, buy him or her this book -- good reading for the interminable, senseless waiting time.at jury selection can take weeks.

If you've been working in the corporate world and you know how to handle yourself in business settings, you absolutely must use this book.  Don't wait till you need it! Start reading now.<br />This book is not for everyone. If you're a certified maverick (like me), or you haven't ever fit in to the corporate world, your efforts to apply Lassiter's strategies can backfire. Corporate managers know how to read between the lines. When you try to follow Lassiter's scripts, you have to know the tone to use and the body language to complement your verbal communication.<br />With that caveat, Lassiter's book is one of the most comprehensive and realistic I've come across.  These days, she says, you can't just look for a job. You must proactively identify needs and demonstrate that you can fill them.<br /><br />A few highlights:<br />Come up with some PAR statements: Problem, Action, Resolution.<br />When negotiating, it's not over till it's over! Keep your options open till you've got a written offer...even while you're new on the job..<br />Don't show that you're desperate!<br />Networking is the only way to make career moves -- and Lassiter actually offers tips for would-be networkers. Most books focus on simplistic networking tips that don't work for senior-level managers.<br />Her discussion of executive recruiters is superb -- and frank.<br />If you've got a track record in some organization, this book will be the best you can get. Lassiter doesn't say much about changing careers -- just briefly warns of the difficulty and says &quot;not too often.&quot;  She's really presented in a small book the information you might get from a high-quality outplacement service. I'll even forgive her references to Myers-Briggs -- you might score &quot;introverted&quot; and still be a great salesperson!	2003-07-08

I knew his academic credentials are impeccable and I was prepared to trust what he wrote. And that, I think, accounts for the success of Toxic Emotions.<br />Toxic Emotions covers ground that has been worked before. Workplace pain has been discussed by self-help authors (\\"working wounded\\") and academics who have studied burnout and stress.  Frost's remedies also remain conventional: get exercise, stay detached, be positive, find space outside work.<br />The willingness of executives to explore feelings is no longer new either.  See Marsha Sinetar's The Mentor's Spirit and Mark Albion's Making a Life, Making a Living.  And I once heard a speaker insist that therapy was no longer a taboo topic. \\"Everybody either has been in therapy or has a family member in therapy,\\" he said.<br />The book's contribution comes from integrating these topics and putting them together and offering a research rather than a self-help context.  The \\"toxin\\" medical metaphor offers a creative context to explore workplace pain and make the topic more accessible to those skeptical of new age \\"woo-woo.\\"<br />Toxic Emotions seems directed entirely to managers and focuses on  what managers can and \\"should\\" do --<br />and that's both the strength and limitation of the book. Employees are depicted as passive victims who need management intervention to survive.<br />Unfortunately, most people aren't as lucky as the clerk who was \\"rescued\\" from a toxic boss. They need to learn to protect themselves and take charge of their own lives.<br /><br />And some very fine managers will never be able to function effectively as healers. I was surprised to see no reference to outside resources, such as coaches or consultants. I can understand the author's suspicion of the coaching industry (coaching schools tend to be atheoretical, to say the least) but carefully-selected coaches and consultants can often be less costly and more effective than managers whose gifts lie elsewhere. And, while confiding in a manager may bring short-term emotional relief, someday those confidences may backfire. Hiring a coach seems cheap if the only alternative is to risk your career by being too open.<br />Consultants can also help managers and employees implement Frost's suggestions. For example, they can teach employees to develop positive attitudes and create more balance in their lives.  Saying \\"Just get a grip!\\" works well with some people but others remain clueless -- and some, temperamentally, cannot just shed their frustrations the way they shake water out of an umbrella.  They need to learn to compensate or find a new workplace -- both time-consuming options that call for one-on-one learning experiences.<br />We also need to consider the bigger picture. All organizations may contain the potential for developing toxins. Even Southwest Airlines has been sued by an employee who felt victimized by an overzealous prank. And some employees are more susceptible to toxicity, just as some sneeze more during allergy season.<br />I suspect a large amount of workplace pain comes from feeling trapped, a source not mentioned here .  We need not just empathetic managers but an infrastructure to support alternatives to corporate employment.<br />The absence of cultural support and societal infrastructure to support self-employment, discussed by Pink (Free Agent Nation) and Bridges (JobShift), accounts for a large part of workplace pain.<br /><br />There's a bit of irony in the book's opening anecdote. The author learns he has cancer -- from a call his oncologist makes on a Friday night!<br />Frost was set up for a weekend of helpless worry.  Couldn't the call wait till Monday morning, when he could at least go into action right away or at least get an emergency appointment with a therapist?  A reminder that toxic systems exist in every sector -- so taken for granted that the author doesn't even comment.toxic systems exist in every sector -- so taken for granted that the author doesn't even comment.	2003-06-30

Perfect for the road	I wasn't expecting much from this tape. The book hadn't impressed me very much and I was thinking, &quot;same old...&quot;<br />However, as I listened I realized that Sinetar really has uncovered new ways to view mentoring. She distinguishes mentoring spirit from mentors in a unique, compelling way. Think of light flowing through a pane of glass. We care about the light -- not the glass. Similarly, the mentor is only a transmitter. What we want is the spirit transmitted by the mentor.<br />From this perspective, any person, group or even physical object can be a mentor - anything that embodies a spirit that offers us insight, understanding or support. John Muir, for instance, chose nature as a mentor to escape a horrendous family situation. And she never met the artist Ben Shahn, but she learned from his artwork.  I can relate: I learned from Cynthia Cooper's book She's Got Game (which I also reviewed) -- and I've never held a basketball.<br />Most important, our own silence helps us grow and any meditation, quiet time or sabbatical can enrich us the way a mentor might.<br />There are many other gems on this tape and I plan to listen again...and again. Perhaps most interesting is the glimpse we get into Sinetar's own life and business. We learn that she regularly takes sabbaticals lasting several months -- and once a week she won't work at all. She no longer attends corporate dinners in the evening, although it's normally considered part of the consultant's job.<br />Sinetar recognizes that people have to be careful as they operate within an organization, and I think she underestimates the dfificulty of carving out space in a structured hierarchy. However, I have met folks who swim with ease in the corporate sea, and those will probably resonate even more, as Sinetar gracefully combines spirituality, personal growth and business systems.<br />I was reminded of Carolyn Myss: Despite widely divergent styles and content, both authors create and integrate.<br />Sinretar is far more accessible than Myss and her spiritual challenge is more of a gentle hill than an icy mountain. But don't expect Sinetar to offer a cake walk. One of the best parts of the book compares Olympic level goals with more mundane, amateur achievements, and she cites Neil Postman's wonderful book about our entertainment culture.<br />We want everything to be like television:  no effort, no preparation and pleasantly entertaining, she says. As a former college professor, I have to agree: I've heard a college senior say, &quot;I like this text because it has a lot of pictures.&quot;<br />Heading for a vacation trip? Pack this one in the car and prepare to come back refreshed and, quite possibly, changed.tar is far more accessible than Myss and her spiritual challenge is more of a gentle hill than an icy mountain.

Other reviews have described the plot of First Degree: a bad cop gets killed and lawyer Andy Carpenter must clear his girlfriend Laurie, who has been framed for the murder. There are some plot twists -- a false confession and a possibility that the corpse might belong to someone else -- but for the most part, it's more of a light-hearted romp than a \\"legal thriller.\\"<br />I was hooked when I read the opening, realized Tara was a dog and discovered the \\"grand opening\\" was for a dog park.  And I kept reading, as I wanted to know how the end would turn out.<br />Some books are strong on character or atmosphere. First Degree is a book of plot.  Laurie, the girlfriend who was framed for murder, never became three-dimensional for me. The hero with \\"lawyer's block\\" was fun to read about -- like a guy who's fun for a date but not necessarily a relationship.<br />What kept the book from five-star quality was the element of luck.  Andy Carpenter's co-counsel just happens to know a Lieutenant Colonel in the army -- someone who can open all sorts of doors as well as files to secret information.<br />And Andy has inherited a huge amount of money. Since the OJ trial, we've all learned that money can influence the outcome of a trial.<br />The story behind the crime seems a little contrived as well.  Framing an innocent victim and setting up red herrings is difficult and time-consuming. Few murderers go to all that trouble. The final confrontation is satisfying and well-done, but I think the real winner turns out to be Tara the dog.<br />In a nice subplot, Carpenter wins a judgment for a man falsely accused of a crime. There's a humorous twist when we learn what he does with the money. Like the rest of the book, it's satisfying in a feel-good way, fun to read about and just on the edge of plausible.	2003-06-22
US	43879637	R9PEC3YD95OIY	0312242611	563918722	The Usual Rules: A Novel	Books	3	9	15	N	N	Gripping -- but we've been there before	Like many readers, I couldn't put the book down. Joyce Maynard creates a warm cast of characters: Wendy, the plucky heroine who mourns the loss of her mother in the 911 tragedy; Josh, the father who dispenses homemade brownies along with sensitive love;  Wendy's dead mother, who gave her a wonderful start in life; and Wendy's real father, Garrett, who teaches her to tie flies, shows her the SF art museum and takes her on a breath-taking hike.  Garrett's girlfriend, Carolyn, becomes Wendy's confidante and role model.<br />Much of the action takes place in Davis, a small town near Sacramento -- and a perfect place for anyone to heal from tragedy. Maynard doesn't play up the beauty and serenity of this college town, with its bike paths and health food stores and of course the presence of a great university with some world-class departments.<br />Wendy recovers by skipping school and meeting a series of people, each of whom adds something to her life: Alan in the bookstore, Violet the single mom, and Todd the child of the streets.<br />And that's where I began to feel I was back in the world of the classic Roller Skates, or perhaps the Little Colonel's Holidays, where a child finds herself temporarily set apart from her usual life and finds adventure and healing.<br />At the turn of the century, when those books were written, a young girl could walk everywhere and avoid harm. Today, I can't believe that a bookstore owner would take a 13-year-old girl alone in his car, on a trip from Davis to Modesto.  I won't even hire a teenage dog sitter without consulting her parents.  And wandering around the middle of the night in a not-so-great neighborhood in SF, Wendy finds a new friend.<br />That, I think, is a large part of the book's appeal. Wendy is in a cocoon of support that few people enjoy, with or without losing a parent. I suspect that readers don't want to read about Wendy -- they want to *be* Wendy!<br />Most well-meaning parents I know would be more concerned with Wendy's grades than her healing and they'd rush her off to a well-meaning shrink.  And while Wendy's friends and acquaintances face tragedies, not related to 911, Wendy actually has an awful lot going for her -- more than just about any  teenaged fictional heroine since the Little Colonel.<br />So yes, this book is un-put-downable, but it's like a hot fudge sundae. You tell yourself it's really got substance but in your heart you know you're just enjoying the taste,<br />and you wish it could go on forever without costing calories.<br />At the risk of sounding like Scrooge, as I so often do these days, I wouldn't give this book to a teenager or offer Wendy as a role model. Most kids need to find a way to make their own luck, like Todd does and Violet doesn't.ith Wendy's grades than her healing and they'd rush her off to a well-meaning shrink.

And only a seasoned journalist could combine technical details, a sense of history and the gossip we're really looking for.<br />The theme of the book is that Air Force One is more than a plane. It's a symbol of the US and of presidential power. Most important, AF One offers presidents a chance to be alone -- and a chance to take off their suits and reveal themselves in jeans, sweats and Boxer shorts.<br />Some presidents come alive more than others in this account. We get a feel for Nixon, Clinton and Ford, but less for Kennedy and the present Bush. The Carter chapter surprised me: the public persona contrasts with the private man and Amy turns out to be a spoiled brat.  Ford was the most decent and caring of all past presidents. And we learn that Reagan was far more disciplined than most of us realized.<br />We begin to realize that Bill Clinton, the first Baby Boomer president, brought a new era to the Presidency as well as the plane: he was actually comfortable in jeans and a t-shirt, and his open expressions of emotion are contemporary. His predecessors seem stiff by comparison.  Wisely, the author remains carefully neutral when writing about the current president.<br />I'd have liked to learn more about the crew who serve AF One. How are they chosen? Do they get special training? What's it like to be a flight attendant or a steward?  And I'd like to hear more about some of the notable reporters, such as Barbara Walters, who gets mentioned only for her dismay at being served a spam sandwich.<br />And Walsh's journalistic role has a downside. I'd have liked to see a chapter with some insights that cut across individual presidents rather than straight reporting. As a reader, I found myself astonished at the ordinary qualities of the leaders of the free world.  Some were not accustomed to being served. Others seemed so ill-suited to the presidency that I wondered how they got so far.<br />Overall, they're downhome, at least a little chauvinistic, insulated from much of the rest of the world because they're too busy with the president to develop a broad exposure.  They play cards and watch light movies.  Most have a roving eye: Kennedy, Johnson and Clinton are well-known but apparently Nixon liked to look, too.<br />Reading this book is like going to Epcot: you feel as though you're getting educated when you're really being entertained, and you can't help enjoying the experience.  For an eerie contrast, read The Ship Who Sang, a classic sci fi novel by Anne McCaffrey.presidency that I wondered how they got so far. <br />Overall, they're downhome, at least a little chauvinistic, insulated from much of the rest of the world because they're too busy with the president to develop a broad exposure.

Learned optimism<br />When Martin Seligman deliver his APA presidential address, I was in the back of the room. His ideas were radical -- too radical for some therapists, who began walking out.  These days Seligman's ideas reach beyond the research community and we can all gain.<br />Here's the basic thesis. When rats receive shock after shock, and nothing they do prevents future shocks, they learn to be helpless. They just give up. Dogs exhibit the same behavior and so do people.  However, not all people -- and, for that matter, not all rats -- succumb. With people, Seligman has learned, thinking style is the moderator, i.e,. the differentiator between those who give up and those who keep going.<br />At first I seem an unlikely person to read this book, let alone recommend it. I'm known as irreverent, cynical and &quot;cantankerous,&quot; as one reader said. However, Seligman defines an optimistic style by the way we respond to adverse events. Optimists see them as specific rather than pervasive, transient rather than permanent, and caused by factors outside oneself.  In that sense, I might qualify!<br />I recommend this book because it is important to understand that thinking style can outweigh other predictors of success. His stories with insurance sales representatives and athletes are persuasive.  One insurance company found that an optimistic style can compensate for lower aptitude, as measured by their traditional test.<br />Seligman also acknowledges that an optimistic style will not always be appropriate. When facing high risk, it's better to err on the side of pessimism.  Indeed, he says, some occupations tend to attract and reward those who are mildly pessimistic.<br />On the downside, I found I could not relate to the tests in the book. Example:<br />Your car runs out of gas on a dark street late at night.<br />Either &quot;I didn't check to see how much gas was in the tank&quot; or, &quot;The gas gauge w as broken.&quot; Well, it seems that the condition of the gas gauge is an objective fact, which I'd find out sooner or later.  And if I stop a crime by calling the police, it's possible that a strange noise caught my attention AND I was alert that day.  Then again, I get irritated at tests in general (hmm...is that a pessimistic style?)<br />The next step is to explore the ways our society and institutions foster a sense of helplessness. Seligman encourages us to get a medical exam if we've experienced many losses, yet the medical profession often encourages us to feel helpless. Taking a pill, which requires getting a prescription, gives all control to the doctor.  Schools, prisons and other governmental institutions teach people they're wrong - and often labels students or inmates as &quot;C student&quot; or &quot;bad person.&quot;<br />And while Seligman says we can all learn to be optimists ,every psychological relationship has limits. In today's economy, when people get knocked down over and over again, are they learning to be pessimists? And can they learn a new style of thinking?<br />Finally, couldn't someone be a pessimist in some life domains and an optimist in others?<br />These questions may be too much to ask of a book destined for a popular audience.<br />Meanwhile,  it's enough to say, this is one of the best popular psych books around, by someone who really knows the score.n of the gas gauge is an objective fact, which I'd find out sooner or later.

I wish I were: I've recommended Finding Your Own North Star to just about every client and every person I know.<br />I was afraid her follow-up book would not be able to keep up the pace, but she's exceeded my expectations.  The joy diet is not about food, she clarifies right away. It's a ten-step program to bring more joy into your life.<br />Beck does not promise that joy will also bring money, sports cars and mansions into your life.  If you read carefully, she warns that you need to work hard for what you want.  But if you follow the ten steps she proposes, it's hard to imagine that you won't find more success than you ever dreamed possible.<br />I was a little nervous as I read the chapter on risk. As a coach myself, I am very leery of encouraging people to take big risks, like quitting a job without another one waiting. Beck offers some good questions to ask before  you take the leap, such as, &quot;Is this the only way?&quot;<br />Everyone will find a favorite chapter and mine was &quot;truth,&quot; because I've never seen this material anywhere else.  It's not the usual spiel about integrity - it's about facing your own reality, which can be tough.<br />The most challenging step for many will be &quot;connection.&quot; During a transition, as she says, you have to leave some people behind, and for awhile -- often a long while -- you are on your own. That's why so many people hire a coach or counselor.<br />As before, Ms. Beck combines insight and wisdom with a delightful sense of humor.  She doesn't talk down to us, her readers, and she doesn't offer bromides and easy answers.  And I especially enjoy watching a Harvard-trained social scientist attack career and life challenges, combining intelligence with commonsense. I'm a fan.	2003-05-27

I gave this book five stars because Adams offers a clear message on a vital topic that deserves more attention.<br />I know at least three women who have entered therapy because they can't handle their grown children. One college graduate won't leave home or get a job. Another has been on drugs and a third was diagnosed as mentally ill.  When I say, \\"Can't you just detach?\\" they say, \\"You have no kids -- just a dog. It's harder than you think.\\"<br />So I was happy to read the same message from Jane Adams, a social psychologist who's an expert. Take care of yourself, she urges parents. Set limits. We can only save ourselves.<br />Parents who do too much are pleasing themselves, not the children. Their addiction, says Adams, is to the belief that anything can be fixed.  In reality, \\"Parenthood is one long exercise in relinquishing control -- or the illusion that we ever had it. Postparenthood is about acceptance.\\"<br />Not all acceptance is about criminal activity or mental illness.  Adams should be commended for recognizing that sometimes there's nothing to be shocked about. Most cults, she says, are fairly harmless, and sexual orientation is not a choice.  Don't waste time trying to force changes.<br />The style and structure of the book resemble an informal support group.  Adams's style uses a lot of \\"We\\" sentences: \\"As parents, we...\\"  After awhile, I found myself irritated, especially when I read something alone the lines of,. \\"As we get older, we are willing to accept lower-paying, less competitive jobs...\\" Who's this \\"we?\\" I certainly do not fit this pattern, nor do my contemporary-age friends.<br />You'll find many stories from real parents with out-of-control adult children. While they held my attention, I kept waiting for more commentary. We (see, I'm doing it now!) buy books to gain expertise and information. For instance, the author talks about doing too much, but do some parents do too little?  What happens when parents take a really hard line, demanding their children find their own jobs?<br />More broadly, I wish the author had utilized more of her social psychology background. Life course research has been \\"hot\\" for sometime -- the theory that the year of our birth can influence an entire cohort. Does a particular generation face unique challenges? Are those challenges real?  Many of my friends say, \\"Today it's hard for children to be on their own -- housing prices are high, jobs are scarce.\\" But weren't housing prices always high, relative to starting salaries?<br />On the other hand, what will happen to a generation of young people who graduate into a world of scarce jobs? And today's children may be more accustomed to luxurious homes. They want the luxuries their parents obtained after years of saving.  Why? And what can be done about it?<br />When one colleague said his kids won't move out, he admitted that each had a beautiful room with a cable television set as well as a computer. The maid did everyone's laundry and the wife cooked splendid meals. I asked him if he'd adopt me so I could move in too!<br />I also wonder, more disturbingly, if the meaning of \\"family\\" needs to be changed, at least in a legal sense. Adams seems to suggest that children need to learn the consequences of their actions. But in many states, children can be held responsible for the cost of their parents' nursing homes and medical bills. The parents may have been wasteful and irresponsible.  Surely children should be able to turn their own parents loose.<br />This book is very short -- less than 200 pages of fairly large type. If there is another edition, I hope the author adds more theory, more expertise and more context.

However, I was delightfully surprised. Fans of Fairstein will enjoy another romp with her heroine, Alexandra Cooper, and supporting cast of police officers.<br />New York's Metropolitan and Natural History museums have planned a joint exhibit \\"The Bestiary,\\" featuring depictions of animals in medieval art and artifacts.  While they are setting up the exhibit, the body of a young South African intern is discovered in an Egyptian tomb.<br />Who was this intern and why was she murdered? That's the main plot of the book and we have plenty of detours for special cases of Cooper's Sex Crimes unit.<br />As other readers have noted, the book isn't especially scary, despite a short \\"trapped\\" scene near the end, even when the characters prowl around deserted museum floors after dark. However, there IS suspense, created by our search for the intern's history.  And we do learn an awful lot about how skeletons and other remains have been placed in museums.  If the book is accurate, there's been a callous disregard for ancestors of people who care very much about  honoring the dead.<br />While terror may be missing, there's an abundance of likeable characters, including a young woman who flies from London to help the investigation.  We learn a lot about museums and museum politics. I'll never view the Met the same way again.<br />I had trouble putting the book down -- a happy, rare event these days -- but the ending was a little disappointing. If we were given clues ahead of time, I didn't detect them.<br />And I have to agree with Alexandra's friend who warns that Jake, Alex's current boyfriend, isn't right for her. It's obvious the author has trouble making Jake, the international journalist, come alive on the pages, and soon he'll be gone.<br /><br />Will Alexandra become romantically involved with her cop friend, Mike? Perhaps after his current love dies tragically?<br />I hope not. We need to maintain the tensions of their friendship.<br />And Alexandra remains an attractive thirty-six years old.

The book as a realistic feel and the characters grow on me with each volume.<br />There's gentle suspense. This detective agency tracks down a lost family, to help a client repay a debt, and a straying husband, who turns out to be uncomfortably close to the agency.<br />Although Precious Ramotswe owns a detective agency,<br />she draws on common sense and her vast network, rather than special skills. Unlike Miss Marple, she doesn't go out of her way to find mysteries, or even label her puzzles as mysteries. She just enjoys life to the fullest.<br />Her fiance,Mr. Maketoni, provides a nice foil, with his motor repair agency, and we now meet two apprentices who have the potential to add additional flavor to the series.<br />Like M. C. Beaton, Smith writes small books that convey a sense of place with economy and skill.  However, his characters have a dignity that keeps the book charming rather than humorous. Smith is respectful, while Beaton takes a satiric twist every so often.<br />Stiill, of all mysteries I read, Beaton bears the closest resemblance. Fortunately for fans, both authors are prolific. With any luck, we'll see many more volumes in our lifetime.	2003-05-22

As other reviewers observed, this book is not about how to write or how to market your writing. It's about the day-to-day life of being a writer.<br />Get up. Go to word processor. Stare at computer awhile.<br />Rejection. Bad reviews. Writing a novel under deadline pressure. And a whole lot more.<br />Word Work is a collection of Rogers's columns, so each chapter can be read as a stand-alone. That's a plus and a potential downfall. If you open the book, as I did, to a chapter that's doesn't grab you right away, you may be tempted to toss the whole thing aside.  I couldn't get excited about \\"best time to write.\\" The message seems to be, \\"Whenever you want.\\"<br />On the other hand, you can read a chapter at a time, in any order, and feel satisfied.<br />Which chapters are best? I suspect that will be a personal decison. What made the book work for me were  \\"Death and the day job,\\" \\"in the affirmative,\\" and \\"advanced affirmations.\\"  That's when I realized Rogers was a thoughtful person who knows how to read self-help without getting suckered. And, like Natalie Goldberg in Thunder and Lightning, Rogers really writes about life, not just the writing life.<br />In particular, Chapter 1 - Hunters and Farmers - blew me away. I had never heard of this metaphor, which apparently comes from an author of a book on ADD. Writers are primarily hunters -- and so are entrepreneurs.<br />The chapters aren't light reading. You don't need to underline and read each sentence three times to get the meaning, but you won't always get hooked on the first sentence.  And Rogers makes no effort to sell the reader. A chapter \\"The Foam White Bull\\" would be more approachable if titled \\"The Minotaur in the Basement.\\"<br />I would like to see two major changes if Rogers gets to a second edition. First, Rogers needs an opening chapter, describing his own life, to unify the chapters and give us a context. The author of a daily or weekly column becomes an old friend. We see his name over and over again and sooner or later we read and we get hooked. In a book, however, we need bait.  And Word Work is a very personal book, so we need more background about the author..<br />Second, the cover is off-putting. The design shows the back half of a wine-colored iMac and some stacks of paper. That's not the view most writers have of their own computers. I see the front of my computer, rarely the side view.  And the cover artist needs to sacrifice esthetics for readability. The front words sprawl over the artwork and the back cover -- yellow on gray? -- presents a real challenge.<br />This is the book to give your writer friend for her birthday or his Christmas.  As other reviewers have indicated, it's not for the raw beginner who is still busy asking, \\"What should I write and where do I send what I write?\\"  It's really for someone who's committed to writing and wants to hear from someone who's been there.  Writing is lonely and Rogers is a good companion for the journey.sement.\\"<br />I would like to see two major changes if Rogers gets to a second edition.

His life is being repossessed by his creditors -- until old friend and book Ken Gorlocki invites him to take a lucrative part-time job.  At the same time, another old friend gets him a job in a convenience store.<br />Jake gets carried away with his new career and some unpleasant people tend to disappear from his life. He's also turning out to be smart and resourceful.  In the end, he combines his legal and illegal lives to find a new career -- not as lucrative as what he had before, but better than the alternatives.<br />The plot isn't new, but Iain Levison has a light-hearted style that keeps the pages turning.  The hero Jake is more likeable and more believable than the hero of Donald Westlake's The Ax.  And the crime scenes are creatively staged.  And, to anyone following the economic news, there's a deeper meaning under the story.<br />I gave the book 4 stars because of the writing -- nice pacing and plot . It's not an easy book to forget.  And I suspect it will inspire an awful lot of wishful thinking.	2003-05-12

If you're looking for a Caribbean adventure and excitement, with pirates and smugglers, you won't find it here. However, if you want to take a lazy cruise with Ed Teja, come aboard!<br />Disclosure: Ed lives here in Silver City, so I learned about his unique background. He has lived aboard a boat and his book is based on a real Ron Anejo. This book shares a few adventures as the  nameless narrator drifts around, scrounging for food and a place to live.<br />Needless to say, every adventure ends in hilarious disaster. The boat goes around and they call the Coast Guard -- before they realize they're carrying smuggled goods! They cater a charter -- and leave everyone stranded when the boat dies.<br />There's plenty of rum, sunshine and laughter, and nobody takes himself (or, occasionally, herself) seriously.  As Ron sums up: They're living the life that everyone dreams about. Who cares what else happens?	2003-05-09

I've always been fascinated by social networks, having read Granovetter's work on strong vs. weak ties. As a career coach, I naturally talk to clients about the joys and frustrations of networking -- and I loved the movie &quot;Six degrees of separation.&quot;<br />If you're looking for an easy piece of entertainment, this is not the book for you. Watts shows how this field has advanced by combining research efforts in information science, physics, mathematics and sociology.  We look over his shoulder as he collaborates with other scientists to solve tough problems -- and get a glimpse of modern science in action (although I think Watts emphasizes the more positive, cooperative aspects of &quot;doing science&quot;).<br />Students of psychology will enjoy his discussion of Milgram's famous experiment -- messages mailed to a Boston stockbroker -- and the real, as compared to legendary, results.  Milgram's even more outrageous obedience experiment, which Watts includes, also deserves a footnote: subjects refused to obey (a) when the experimenter broke the rules and gave reasons for the order and (b) when they were able to reconstruct their roles outside the laboratory.<br />I began by borrowing this book from a library but realized that it needs to be owned. It's not a quick, one-time read. Although it's accessible, you have to pay attention and I found a need to read sequentially, from chapter to chapter.  But if you read carefully, you'll change the way you look at the world.<br />As other reviewers have noted, Watts shows how daily life is influenced by properties of networks: Why do some viruses, computer and biological, spread, and why others come to a quick halt?  Why  do airline hub-and-spoke networks often break down?  How do computer searches work and what makes them effective?<br />We're living in an increasingly connected world and this book will help us see and understand the connections more clearly. I think it's a must for anyone who wants to comprehend our world today.nd our world today.	2003-05-09
US	43879637	R1SUV74TW7FIOR	0374177139	55529285	The Interpreter	Books	5	28	31	N	N	One of the best I've read in quite awhile	As other reviewers have noted, The Interpreter offers a third-person view of one Suzy Park whose life up to now can best be described as dysfunctional. She's survived two affairs with married men (although she's remarkably comfortable in her \\"mistress\\" role), dropped out a first-rate college, drifted from job to job, and kept only one friend.<br />Her present job, as a contract interpreter working for an agency, has held her longer than others.  On one of her jobs, she translates for a witness who happens to know something about her parents, who died of gunshot wounds in 1995. She decides to investigate their death, her own past and the mysterious disappearance of her older sister Grace, who has always been distant.<br />Although the heroine is not especially appealing (you want to shake her and send her to a therapist, pronto), her life makes sense in terms of her background. A dysfunctional life comes from a supremely dysfunctional family -- with layers of mystery.<br />I had trouble putting the book down, although it had qualities of literary fiction and \\"girl books\\" as well as murder mystery. The author manages to give us a fresh view of New York, which has been the scene of so many novels. As I read I fondly remembered the Long Island Railroad and the stops on the Number 7 Queens line -- and the way they're counted out by riders. She also gives us a gritty but entertaining view of the Korean immigrant lifestyle as well as the realities of the legal proceedings where she translates. She reads between the lines and occasionally oversteps her boundaries, knowing immigrants have their own code and their own realities.<br />The sense of setting and the pacing make this novel succeed, despite the unsympathetic main character and the even less sympathetic romantic entanglements.  Along with Suzy, we are exposed to one mystery after another. Why did the family move so often? Where did they get money to buy a store? Where are the family's citizenship papers? Why is the sister so aloof? Who murdered the parents and why?<br />Amazingly, Suki Kim ties up all these loose ends in the last two short chapters. The story behind the murder makes everything fit together, even the reason for her sister's aloofness (if we read between the lines).<br />The ending is satisfying but not happy.  I am reminded of the oft-quoted psychological truth: People need meaning to be happy, but meaning doesn't necessarily bring happiness.<br />Heroine Suzy Park can now make a patterned quilt out of the scraps of her life. We're satisfied. She may never be.the sister so aloof? Who murdered the parents and why?   <br />Amazingly, Suki Kim ties up all these loose ends in the last two short chapters.

Heroines of both books hold jobs they love and balance family against work.  However, Kate is smart, witty and a little cynical, and she holds down an exciting, globe-trotting job in a men's world. Rose is less exciting.<br />Rose Lloyd, a London book reviewer, loves every aspect of her life: her house, garden, husband, children and, most of the time, her job.  As you know before you begin, that life is about to change drastically. Both her husband and her boss choose Rose's assistant, Minty, as a younger replacement. Armed with generous settlements from both husband and boss, Rose begins a new life -- starting with a delightful shopping trip to Paris orchestrated by an old friend.<br />As other reviewers have noted, the theme is not new, and ultimately the end is also predictable: everybody realizes that the younger version may be more attractively packaged -- until you get up close. Those who dumped Rose would like to undo the damage but it's too late. Rose has grown beyond what she had. What did we expect?<br />Although I found myself flipping past some of the flashbacks of Rose's married life, the British setting and excellent writing held my interest and contributed to the 4-star rating. However, there was little new here. Rose's daughter Poppy learns the same lessons about marriage as Minty -- it's not all romance and fireworks.  Rose's mother supported the family as a travel agent -- dull, perhaps, but hardly the life of a servant or factory worker. And she's diagnosed with an illness...yes, just the sort of illness that female characters get in these novels.<br />The author may have intended to create &quot;everywoman&quot; and &quot;everypeople,&quot; but I'd have liked more personality and depth in the characters.  Rose comes across as passive. Her husband had helped her get the job and his job dictates a lot of their social life.  Even in the depths of despair, her friends take the initiative to help her.  She's gracious and mature throughout.<br />Rose's job, editor of a book review section, doesn't add energy to the plot.  There's no inherent drama in reviewing books and surely Rose would realize she's on a sideline, away from mainstream part of the newspaper, acquiring few marketable skills. She's set herself up for trouble: a job where there's no place to go, working for the same firm as her husband.  Frankly, they've all done her a favor.  Any change would be for the better. Now she can get a life!<br />In contrast, Kate Reddy (heroine of I Don't Know How She Does It) brings a wry wit to her observations. She also has a more interesting career and she's not nearly so naive. She'd have seen this one coming a long time ago.n the depths of despair, her friends take the initiative to help her.

Hamish is back, slightly perturbed by stories that his adored Priscilla will be marrying someone else. He knows they're unsuitable -- but he misses her.<br />Tall, red-headed Hamish continues to attract women, however, and the local reporter Elspeth has been showing some interest.  With her help, he digs into a series of cases that only loosely relate to one another.<br />A nearby village seems caught up in a sinister spell. A lovely young wife seems to be abused. Residents check into a local nursing home and some seem to check out awfully fast. And villagers report some mysterious action along the jagged coastline.<br />Hamish loves a mystery but this time his skill may get him the reward he doesn't want: a promotion to a big-city police force, where he'll be lost in the crowd.<br />Nearly every character in the series -- as  well as the reviewers -- call Hamish unambitious, but I think he's a man who's got everything he wants, and he knows it.  And on some level, he seems to know he's not destined for marriage (thankfully -- the series would never be the same) and takes comfort in his beloved dog, Lugs.<br />It's easy to dismiss M.C. Beaton's books as light -- and they are -- but she's a solid writer. She creates characters in a sentence or two and even gives them some depth. Her characters have self-defeating flaws as well as heroic virtues. Her books are small but you get a real sense of people and place -- the result of tight, careful writing.  On page 233, we learn how Hamish acquired Lugs -- in 3 sentences.  Some writers would need 3 pages.<br />Let's hope we see a few dozen more volumes from this prolific and gifted author.	2003-04-24

Darkness Gathers has many ingredients for success: an appealing heroine, the heroine's ambivalent relationship with a male love interest, colorful settings, and an intriguing opening salvo: a tape recording mailed anonymously to the heroine.<br />I really wanted to like this book, as we need more new authors and more detectives.  And I hope the author takes the next step to write a breakout novel next time.<br />I'll let other reviewers describe the plot -- and I agree with those who say it's &quot;ambitious,&quot; even audacious.  What stopped me was pacing. I kept wanting to take my own blue pencil to the copy and cut, cut cut!<br />The book opens with a long flashback, which didn't seem necessary. Lydia's childhood traumas may have led her to become a journalist of crime, but that deserves a sentence or two. Think of Ranger Anna Pigeon in the Nevada Barr series. We learn early that the heroine was widowed early and tragically -- but from New York widowhood to Park Service Ranger is a story that was left untold for six or so volumes, and we didn't miss it.<br />After reading Sol Stein's books on writing, I've become more conscious of redundant words and phrases, so perhaps I'm overly sensitive.  I noticed that Lydia wore a &quot;jade black hair clip&quot; in her &quot;black hair.&quot; Um...what other type of clip would she wear?  How about just &quot;pulled into a knot with a shiny black clip?&quot;<br />You can pick almost any page, if you're so inclined:<br />&quot;He took hold of her hand and rolled over onto his back, displaying his enviable abs and pecs...&quot;<br />Or &quot;She reached over ... with fingers cool and moist from the sweating plastic cup she held.&quot;<br />Less description, more action -- especially if the author uses the omniscient viewpoint, where we readers are like outsiders watching a show.  And description can be presented with action.<br /><br />My other quibbles:<br />We're told over and over again that Lydia has a special sense -- but it's not clear how she uses that sense in her work. Anyone who receives an anonymous tape, referring to a kidnapped girl, might be just a wee bit curious!<br />I had trouble with the far-flung plot -- Albanian kidnappings tied in with a villain from Lydia's dark past.  I'd also like to see more sides to Lydia and Jeffrey.  Instead of tagging along on Lydia's hare-brained ideas, Jeffrey needs to work his own caseload. He comes across as a little wimpy -- chasing after a woman who has her own agenda. Lovesick is fine for a tale or two but at some point we need gumption!<br />These two need to get into a solid fight and stop speaking sometime! If Jeffrey wants a relationship, he'd better start poking around...and let Lydia sulk and question her own feelings.

Unlike many books I get these days, I didn't find myself mentally editing whole paragraphs. And it's easy to get swept up in the stories of women and their money.<br />It's been said that New Age is a religion conceived in prosperity, while other religions help people accept misery and suffering. In a way this book is about creating a spiritual base for appreciating one's own wealth, in the context of a very traditional religion with official messages of \\"Love the poor and despise the rich.\\"<br />Adele Azar-Rucquoi delivers two parallel themes. First we learn the story of her own life, a struggle to find meaning in money in an affluent home, with a father who never felt he had enough. Adele's search for spirituality, as well as a comfort level with money, takes her first into the Roman Catholic pre-Vatican church and then into a convent. She loved the religion and the life, yet she marveled that nuns and priests lived a lot better than the poor -- in fact, a lot better than a good part of the world. The real poverty came, she learned, from following the rules, giving up individual possessions and enduring banal conversations at dinner.<br />Leaving the convent, Adele has socked away (from an illicit teaching job) enough to give herself a good start. Despite her struggles with the meaning of wealth, she has inherited her father's gift for earning money and her brother stands by to help her invest wisely. Through therapy, she gains the strength to ends an affair with a priest that combined finance with romance, at the cost of secrecy.<br />After a few twists and turns, she ends up with a huge inheritance that once again forces her to confront her money philosophy. In an ending that would not be plausible in a novel, she finds herself happily married to a man who had been homeless for a year, just before they met.<br />Each chapter begins with an episode from Adele's life, then follows with stories of women at a similar stage in their own lives. Each story held my interest, but the cumulative effect left me wondering when we'd get to the point.<br />To make the book work, you have to believe that women have unique problems with money, rarely talk about money and cannot achieve a comfort level with money. In the age of Suze Orman, Leona Helmsley, and Mary Kay, those beliefs no longer ring true.<br />Rather than focusing on money, these stories ultimately deal with bad marriages, misguided romances and rags-to-riches determination. And as someone who works with people in career transition, and who has lived awhile, I found little that was new here. Many stories followed the sequence trauma-therapy-salvation. One woman's husband lost her fortune -- almost a cliche! Another has learned to live for each day, trusting the next phase of her life will be just fine.<br />So...what do we learn from all this? The exercises at the end of the book were not compelling, especially since there are no ties to the rest of the book. The author has talent and data. She needs to get clear on her message. Does she want to write a self-help book? Develop a memoir of her own life (which calls for a theme)?<br />Today, Prosperity Programs cloaked in \\"spirituality\\" abound on and off the Internet. Today's gurus write, unabashedly, about the path to health and wealth. In this environment, Adele's concern with money seems a little quaint and outdated, somewhat like Thomas Merton's concerns with sins that seem mild today. I think the author has a stronger message waiting, and I hope she finds her voice to share it.

And there's a lot of hype these days about &quot;assessments&quot; that are one step away from witchcraft.  Here's the Real Deal.<br />Levine argues that most people want to learn and succeed in their lives. What holds them back often is the way their brains are wired.  (Okay, he's a lot more scientific.)<br />I can personally relate to some of his examples. I've always had trouble controlling pieces of paper and my desk always looks as though I'd dumped a wastebasket upside down. Throughout my life people have sighed, &quot;You've got to get organized!&quot; Yet I've learned to accomplish a lot by compensating -- once I realized it was a cognitive deficit.<br />And, as Levine points out, adults have an easier time than children. We don't have to excel in so many different areas.<br />Levine acknowledges his own quirks. Don't give me anything you want back, he says, and if you want me to sign something, stand there till you get my signature!  I can relate to those too.<br />The lesson is that nearly everyone has strengths as well as functional deficits. If a child doesn't have the coordination for basketball or baseball, he or she can try another sport, like weight-lifting or wrestling.<br />Levine presents knowledge in the form of case studies, which are both educational and easy to follow.  He's honest: there are few Cinderella stories and happy endings.  That's the part of the book that's most difficult to deal with. His center provides some of the best testing and counseling in the world, yet not everyone will be responsive. It's not enough to receive a diagnosis: you also need a supportive environment, especially if you're a child.<br />I didn't care for Levine's chapter on &quot;what might have happened.&quot;<br />I'd rather have seen composite cases or cases with details disguised, with stories of &quot;real&quot; endings. And people need to be aware of non-psychiatric settings that allow people to make progress. I've taken well-designed, non-competitive exercise classes that helped everyone's coordination -- including some who could barely shuffle into the class when they started.<br />However, Levine deserves credit for not succumbing to the simplicities of the self-help genre. You won't find self-diagnostic tests or &quot;ten things  you can do...&quot; here.

If you're a connoisseur of the self-help genre, you won't find dramatically new content. Ford's contribution: creative packaging to help us see the wisdom in old truths. Each chapter addresses a dimension of choice and suggests we can choose life affirmation and growth over self-sabotage and decline.<br />Debbie Ford's theme: Each day we make choices, large and small. When we consciously assess the consequences of each choice, we might make different decisions. Standing at the coffee counter, we debate whether to select an espresso mocha with whipped cream or an iced tea.  Facing our computer, we can play an extra game of solitaire or get down to business.<br />Choice gives us power over our lives and I can see where evaluating each day's choices can lead to growth.  As a career coach, I see examples every day and I plan to recommend this book to many people. A client says, &quot;I can't work on my new business in the evenings -- that's the only time to practice gourmet cooking or work in the garden.&quot;  That client shows where her priorities lie -- and has made a choice that will not lead her in the direction of her goals.<br />Two quibbles: The book could have said more about those who systematically make &quot;bad&quot; choices. They may need to recognize and reorganize their agenda. Rather than change their choices, they may have to find a way to redefine their goals and recognize their real priorities.<br />And I am uncomfortable with Ford's chapter on choosing faith instead of fear.  I've seen too many people who leaped to quit a job, move to a new city or enter a new relationship because they just read a book or talked to a coach who said &quot;Go for it.&quot;<br />At the risk of alienating many positive thinkers out there, I think faith needs to be bolstered by careful planning and a safety net. The safety net might be a set of skills and a flexible attitude -- but many people think they're more flexible than they really are.ble attitude -- but many people think they're more flexible than they really are.	2003-04-08

Approaching fifty, he now finds a house in &quot;a small corner of upstate New York,&quot; where he retreats to write and cogitate for several months.  Accompanying him are a dead monk and two dogs, as he says. The monk is Thomas Merton, whose presence begins to seem real as Katz carves out a contemporary version of a hermitage.<br />I found some of the soul-searching a little embarrassing to read. This author, a product of years of psychoanalysis, has no qualms about sharing his thoughts. However, the reflections on midlife are right on. Katz's doubts (yet another comeback?) are real and realistic.  Read his thoughts on the &quot;lonely generation:&quot; with no guidance from parents or ancestors, we have to face change.<br />Worth a read as a role model for those who feel the call of the mountains.	2003-04-02

I picked up this book inadvertently -- and was well-rewarded. While many popular books turn out to be fluff, this one has solid, original guidance.<br />Best section: obstacles. I've never seen such a useful guide to overcoming blocks. Gray identifies the top fifteen blocks and follows up with guides to letting go.  Underlying blame is betrayal -- and blame is healed by anger. Wow!<br />And so on for the other blocks.<br />Another gem: When you're missing unconditional love and support, a therapist may help. When you want friendly support, better to have dinner with a group of friends. Sounds simplistic, and maybe it is, but there's no denying that some people do well with therapy, coaching and counseling while others say, &quot;What's the big deal?&quot; Gray's point may explain a lot.<br />Definitely on my  &quot;must read&quot; list.	2003-03-21

Susan McDougal lost two years of her life to false accusations and bogus charges. As she pointed out, she couldn't testify without risking charges of perjury, because her husband was willing to sell out. And she really didn't have anything to say.<br />What's truly scary is that Susan McDougal served almost her entire sentence for refusing to testify, although little was to be gained after a few months. The conditions of her incarceration were horrendous. Often she was more afraid of the guards than her fellow prisoners. The Mehta accusations were so bizarre that the jury complained -- yet McDougal had trouble finding a lawyer to represent her. She was incredibly lucky when a top-notch lawyer volunteered. Yes, justice depends entirely on accidents like this one.<br />What's amazing is that McDougal emerged from her nightmare not only sane but also determined to speak out on behalf of women prisoners.  She doesn't preach or proclaim: she just tells her story. In the end, that's more chilling than any drama she could have created.	2003-03-21

Moving back and forth between past and present allows the author to experiment with new forms and keeps the reader from becoming bored with a familiar format.<br />Not that we could ever be bored with Anna, the no-nonsense ranger, who grows herself as she allows romance to enter her life in the unlikely form of Paul Davidson, a rare combo of priest and sheriff.  Here Anna flexes her administrative skills and buys herself time to review Paul's marriage proposal, as she serves as Acting Supervisory Ranger on an isolated Caribbean island.  Anna retrieves her boating skills from her Lake Superior job - the second in the series - and yet she's become older and wiser, comfortable with being in charge.<br />Like Anna, the supporting cast consists of three-dimensional characters.  Background checks reveal criminal past of a kind-hearted person and fail to disclose evil in one who appears to have a past.  A ranger who appears ludicrously over-zealous turns out to be a hero.<br />True, Nevada Barr lingers lovingly over Anna's surroundings -- because Anna does, too. Anna puts up with the NPS bureaucracy so she can, as she says, have time with sights and sounds the tourists only glimpse on a quick run-through. She has friends and she knows love, but her deepest relationships come from a sense of place.<br />She's grown accustomed to being dropped into a group of strangers, where physical reality takes precedence over emotional self-awareness: in several books, she's naked or clad only in her \\"underpants\\" among strangers<br />as she accomplishes her goal of saving lives, catching criminals and maintaining her own hold on sanity.<br />This book lets us spend more time in Anna's company and also treats us to a page-turning modern mystery. I have to admit I skimmed over the latter parts of the historical story, which was less compelling than the modern version.  the The historical \\"letters\\" seemed to use suspiciously contemporary language and imagery.odern version.    the The historical \\"letters\\" seemed to use suspiciously contemporary language and imagery.	2003-03-13

Darien and her husband, Robert, are quintessential New York yuppies: she's in PR and he's in corporate law, they have a place in the country and they have access to the high-priced, high-powered therapy available only to urbanites who know who to ask. Even the dog has been yuppified: he stays at \\"Uptown Dog\\" kennels and wears a shock collar in the country.<br />Biased? Well, yes. Darien is the kind of person only a therapist could love. She's exquisitely self-centered, turning every encounter into a discussion of her own reactions. Her history of self-sabotage and bad decisions gets old, fast.  Darien's husband, Robert, comes across as so supportive he borders on wimpy. True, he tries to get her committed at one point, and he insists she get help -- but many spouses in his situation would give up and head for the divorce court.<br />Darien admits she's had so much therapy she plays games with her new psychiatrist, even though she respects this woman and wants to work with her.  This therapist gets paid big bucks to be patient. As a reader, I found myself skimming through the pages and then turning back to see if I had missed some great moment along the way.  I hadn't.<br />There is only one revelation about Darien's past. As a non-therapist, non-patient, I wonder why it would have taken so long. Perhaps an inadvertent lesson of this book is that bad therapy wastes time, at best, while good therapy works. Or perhaps Darien was ready to heal now.<br />I was curious about the people in Darien's workplace: an obnoxious, unappreciative boss, a gay male colleague and the closest thing Darien has to a female friend.  I find it hard to imagine that any coworker, especially an openly gay man who had shown sensitivity in the past, would greet Darien's return with a question about the \\"loony bin.\\"  And I wonder why Darien remained in this den of discomfort, when someone with her talents would have options to move.  More self-punishment?  One thing is clear: Darien could keep a team of therapists busy for several more years.<br />The book is well-written and the author maintains suspense.

Interrupting the session to search for dog treats, she returns to find a dead body. The mob quickly removes the evidence, but Holly remains nervous, with good reason. Another shoot-out gives her a fright and lands her neighbor in the hospital.<br />Holly doesn't track clues and the murderer's identity is a surprise, although a clever one. While I kept turning the pages, I felt a little cheated of a true mystery. Holly's dog savvy remains unquestioned but I wish the author had given her a murder that drew on her unique skills and talents. A spoof? An author who can't resist the \\"dogfather\\" pun?<br />Regardless, I most liked the stories where Holly speaks the language of dogs to uncover the murderer.  Here Holly turns over the stage to the ...well, Dogfather.<br />Holly's training tips are valuable as always (bits of roast beef work well as treats!) and we can welcome back her former lover, Steve the veterinarian. The author has created a quandary for herself: Mystery heroines with romantic interests tend to lose their allure, and Steve is such a terrific catch that Holly's resistance makes no sense.<br />Even Holly is beginning to realize he's a prize.<br />And Holly's cat Tracker needs to mellow out.  She needs to consult a cat therapist!  I have one dog and two cats and everybody needs attention, every day.	2003-03-11

And ...I liked it!<br />Author Salmonsohn presents some basic truths that we've all heard before. (&quot;Relax.&quot; &quot;Let go.&quot;) But she presents these sayings in a context of sophisticated graphics and down-to-earth realism. I especially like her warning, which I paraphrase as,  &quot;Don't seek career advice from people who don't have careers, or relationship advice from people who don't have relationships.&quot;  It's not completely accurate: some people can &quot;teach&quot; better than they can &quot;do.&quot; But it's worth considering.<br />And her warning that every year has a &quot;winter phase&quot; is right on.<br />Like most readers, I'm absorbing Salmonsohn's words after reading dozens of self-help books, so none of these ideas are really new. I'm wondering if this book would really melt the heart of a cynic or someone who is truly resistant to change -- or if they'd respond like an atheist who is urged to try a contemporary hip &quot;new&quot; religious service.<br />My hunch is that this book makes a great gift and recipients, like me, will appreciate the sender's thought and intention, regardless of the book's actual content.  It's nice when someone says, &quot;I know you're a cynic but I like you anyway.&quot; Hmm...that's a sentiment right out of the book!	2003-03-01

Birthday Party Murder, one of the best in the Lucy Stone series, could serve as a model for anyone who wants to write in this genre. Heroine Lucy Stone deals with her own spreading waistline, a daughter's co-ed slumber party, a son's first-year college woes, a job on the local paper, a husband who's supportive but busy, an old lady whose newly discovered relatives seem a little odd...and oh yes, she's asked to investigate the murder of a lawyer who had just set up a meeting with that same little old lady.<br />If you've ever tried to write a novel, you will appreciate the author's skill as she gathers these plot lines together in a seamless whole. Most readers will guess at least part of the outcome but that's part of the fun. Meier evokes the seasons and celebrations of a small New England town and life in a family that's doing well as long as mom brings home a paycheck. Lucy and her husband Bill are a long-married couple and it shows.<br />A great escape for a dreary day or a plane ride.

His book offers the familiar promise, &quot;It's never too late,&quot; but with some surprising twists.<br />The best part of this book is the section on deciding what you want to do with your life. Pollan's exercises are original and would, I believe, help many people to discover their own next step. For instance, Pollan urges readers to review activities that they love -- and also places that draw forth a passionate response.  His question, &quot;What need does this passion address?&quot; is extremely helpful and, unfortunately, rarely asked.<br />Implementation sections are helpful but I would encourage readers to seek supplementary guidance. Pollan suggests that a degree from University of Phoenix may be as helpful, in some cases, as a degree from Harvard. I encourage my own clients to talk to alumni from any school. Some doors will be closed to Phoenix alums, including some adjunct teaching options.  On the other hand, a fifty-plus career changer who wants to set up shop as a counselor would do as well with a degree from the fastest, lowest-cost school whose courses are recognized by the state in question.<br />Still, I would be careful. I have heard first-account accounts of degree programs losing acceptability by accrediting bodies.<br />Pollan urges readers to omit dates from a resume. If you're using a back-door method to get a job (as you should!) that strategy will work. However, if your resume goes through a human resource department, it will most likely get tossed or you will be asked to submit traditional resume with dates.<br />Finally, I was disturbed by the grammar errors distributed lavishly through the text. A top publisher should have provided a copy editor! In particular the author writes &quot;I&quot; instead of &quot;me&quot;<br />(&quot;he showed my wife and I...&quot;)<br />Despite these qualms and quibbles, if you're a midlife career changer, you'll find this book more helpful than most.

The reviews were glowing and,  as a former marketing professor, I was more than a little interested.<br /> I Want That is a birds eye view of shopping, with pages devoted to everything from gift giving to mall design to deviant buying behavior. There's a history of shopping and a sociology of shopping. Each chapter -- and some of the headings -- could be the topic of a doctoral dissertation. Brevity in this case has become misleading and, frankly,<br />not very exciting. All the juicy stuff has been edited out!<br />For example, Hine devotes just a few pages to compulsive buying, yet there has been considerable research on this topic by marketing researchers as well as clinical psychologists.  There are correlations with other forms of addiction, while Hine notes only gambling.  There are degrees of compulsion that vary by person and situation.<br /><br />The chapter on attention emphasizes that shoppers can judge without being judged. Hine suggests that friends who join the shopper may be judgmental, implying that friends decrease shopping; however, research shows that people who shop together buy more.<br />The author cites research that suggests people continue to follow traditional gender roles. The real story is the change. In fact, some observers believe retailing has been transformed by gender roles more than by any other factor. Why do stores stay open 24/7?  Why do more teens do the family shopping these days?  What about men who are self-described clothes horses?  And while women still buy most Christmas gifts, we need too recognize the increasing numbers of single-person households and families who choose to spend Christmas on a cruise.<br />Anyone who says, &quot;Wow -- a book on shopping! What a great idea!&quot; will probably enjoy this book. Those who are aware of other books on the topic, offering greater depth and insight, will be dissatisfied.  This book lacks the focus, depth and analytical underpinnings of Paco Underhill's Why We Buy and Malcolm Gladwell's The Tipping Point.

As he grew older he realized more of what he was doing, but he had gotten accustomed to the roller coaster ride.  And although he did bilk institutions out of a lot of money, he more than repaid his debt by serving as a security consultant.  I wish the US Government would heed his advice, presented in an appendix, on dealing with terrorists.	2003-02-05
US	43879637	R35SQ2AMYRGT9A	0971699909	31000441	The Same River Twice: A Season with Geno Auriemma and the Connecticut Huskies	Books	5	16	16	N	Y	We need more books like this one!	As an avid fan of women's basketball, I get frustrated with the lack of access. TV  networks show games at odd times -- when they show them at all -- and we don't get pregame and postgame shows to give us insights into the players. Therefore, I really enjoyed this glimpse behind the scenes of a top team, written by a seasoned sports writer.<br />We can learn all about Tennessee's teams from Pat Summitt's excellent books. Here we get a look at UT's chief rival and a coach whose style differs in style, but who is demanding nevertheless. And because we view the season through the eyes of a reporter, we get a more objective view of the team.  This is the first book that talks about practice and drills. I'd read that Geno is a tough coach but also that he jokes a lot in practice -- and Waters explains how this happens.<br />The best part of the book (for me, anyway) was the insight into the individual team members. Diana Taurasi, dazed by the New England winter, bought three winter coats; her teammate who grew up there just had one.  Perhaps the most sympathetic player is Svetlana (&quot;Sveta&quot;) Abrosimova, who gets injured just before her parents finally make the trip from Russia. And at least one of the players is described fondly as &quot;high maintenance.&quot;<br />I'd definitely recommend reading this book along with the Pat Summitt duo and the recent Nice Girls Finish First. Each team has a unique personality and each coach brings a different stle to winning.  The world will be different as these competitive young women take their places in business and in the professions.<br />Same River Twice reads like a novel. Waters delivers high-quality journalism, creating a book that's a &quot;must&quot; for fans. I just wish this book were more widely distributed (why don't more libraries own copies?).  When will publishers realize there's a growing market of fans of the women's teams?	2003-02-05

Becker wants to help high school seniors and their parents as they make choices that could impact them for a lifetime.  She ably explains the differences among Divisions I, II and III, as well as other leagues. She explains the process and gives us an idea of the complex, arcane and (some would say) outdated NCAA rules.<br />The best part of this book: Anecdotes about players I recognized. For instance, Ruth Bolton's sister played for Auburn, so the Assistant Coaches felt obliged to go through the motions with Ruth. Trouble was, Ruth ignored their hints (&quot;Wouldn't you be happier at a lesser school?&quot;) and insisted on coming to Auburn.  She led the Auburn team to many victories, became a 2-time Olympian and now plays for the WNBA!<br />Young women grow up fast when faced with these decisions. Many non-athletic high schoolers are not called on to demonstrate this degree of maturity -- to visit a place and say, &quot;I belong here,&quot; or, &quot;This is not for me.&quot;  Playing basketball, the book seems to say, contributes to maturity, and ultimately to success.<br />You have to be a pretty dedicated fan to read this book - and since there's a dearth of books about women's hoops,  I was glad to get it.  Good writing and some choice anecdotes -- more detail<br />than the average fan needs or wants, but worth skipping over to get to the juicier parts.	2003-02-05

Assigned to work with Mexican immigrants in Southern California, he learned first-hand the realities of border crossing. I was reminded of the old Willie Nelson song about a planeload of  \\"deportees\\" that crashed with little concern from the authorities.<br />Groody is not a sentimentalist and he tries to be even-handed. Although he registers appalling behavior on the part of the Border Patrol, he includes interviews with Border Patrol members in his research, and he acknowledges that there is a much larger picture: the relationship between the US and Mexico.<br />Groody focuses on the way individuals experience immigration. As I noted in my own book, Making the Big Move, identity change creates the greatest stress in any relocation.  Here Groody talks about the way immigrants from Mexico also experience spiritual hunger as they seek to be united with a new community.<br />Perhaps the most vivid and memorable part of the book comes in the description of the four-day retreats, a program implemented by the clergy but designed by former participants who literally speak the language of the immigrants.<br />It is especially moving to read of the reaction of the \\"candidates,\\" the new immigrants, as they are greeted enthusiastically by the staff and are served meals by the staff. Staff members apply for coveted positions -- and they actually pay $75 a week to work in the program.<br />Living eighty miles from the Mexican border, here in New Mexico, I've crossed checkpoints on the highways, often several hundred miles north of the border.  Usually the guards just wave \\"Anglos\\" through and we rarely even stop. This book was a real eye-opener.  At the end, I found myself wondering why we spend millions of dollars to keep out these people, instead of using the money to develop proactive programs here and in Mexico.  Something is not working.	2003-02-05

A focus on self-analysis is easier for the client and more lucrative for a counselor or coach.  As she says, implementation is more challenging and difficult than diagnosis. Additionally, she goes beyond the typical &quot;Get out and network!&quot; advice, offering a theory-based prescription to network with strangers and distant acquaintances.  And she emphasizes that career change is a winding road, not a straight line -- something any experienced career counselor should know.  Her examples echo other recent research by career psychologists, focusing on serendipity as a career force.<br />Mid-career changers have to be especially creative when making career decisions. My only quibble is that her examples come from very well-educated, successful, sophisticated, under-50 career changers. (I detected one 53-year-old male, mentioned briefly.) Those over fifty tend to face additional challenges.  However, the principles can be used by anyone at any career stage.<br />Working Identity has a more serious tone than the typical self-help book, perhaps reflecting the author's research and the Harvard publishing imprint.  It is not a fast, entertaining read, like so many self-help books, and the author offers no exercises to the reader.<br />Ibarra does not discuss social support that might come from friends, family or a paid coach or counselor. I would have liked to see more discussion of the role of personal conflict, such as divorce, on career change, and I would expect to see at least a disclaimer to differentiate a desire for a new career from depression or other psychological crises. The author stresses the need to find a new community, but there's usually a lonely spot when a career-changer has left the old community yet not been accepted by the new.  There are several parallels with my own book, Making the Big Move, which discusses identity loss in the context of relocation.<br />On the other hand, this book succeeds precisely because it avoids many of the pitfalls of the mass market self-help genre.  I am recommending Working Identity to just about everyone I know.  No glitz, no hype -- it's the Real Deal.ological crises.

US	43879637	REVTA7Z6LGVT2	0895261219	798404335	Breaking the Rules of Aging	Books	4	30	30	N	N	Required reading for over-50's	It's nice to hear from a doctor who doesn't chant the party line. Lipschitz is not afraid to criticize common medical mistreatments: unncessary heart surgery, overmedication, and overemphasis on weight.  His discussion of alternative medicine, while a little too conservative for some readers, is more balanced than most.<br />The most valuable part of the book is Lipschitz's portrayal of his elderly active patients who defy the stereotype. Yes, people over seventy can be active healthy and sexual. For my career coaching clients who say they're too old to go back to school, I plan to share the story of the man who completed a doctorate at seventy-five.<br />I especially appreciated the discussion of weight and weight gain. So...being \\"a little bit chubby\\" can actually be healthy? About time we heard this view! And he questions the prevailing wisdom of light exercise. Work out and work hard, he says, and weight-lifting is the preferred exercise for the midlife-to-elderly set.<br />Lipschitz also offers well-informed guidance about excessive or overzealous medicine -- topics doctors usually avoid. Under certain circumstances, he says, chemotherapy and other strong measures can make sense. But sometimes doctors are guilty of jumping in with painful measures to save a life that's already doomed.<br />On the downside, Lipschitz encourages us to believe we can control our destiny, yet he glosses over the aspects of life that we cannot control. He deplores the six-minute office visit, yet most people will deal with time-stressed physicians in HMOs or worse. He encourages us not to be overconcerned with weight loss, yet he says those who gain weight in their midsection (\\"apples\\") are at greater risk than those who gain in their thighs (\\"pears\\"). We can't control where the weight lands and we need more discussion of these implications.<br />Lipschitz devotes considerable space to discussing heart attack prevention, yet ignores other killers, such as diabetes, and other life-destroying conditions, such as hearing and sight impairment.  Of course one book can't cover everything, but this book is relatively small for a hardcover (250 pages). A few chapters on other quality-of-life conditions would have been welcome.<br />And I can't help noting a minor error on page 6 -- possibly a typo. The research, he says, is unambiguous. After age 70, weight and longevity are \\"inversely\\" correlated: the heavier you are after age 70, the longer you are likely to live. This correlation is positive, not inverse.  Well, nearly every doctor has trouble with statistics -- although the subject is important for interpreting medical studies, as Lipschitz himself amply demonstrates throughout the book.<br />Finally, Lipschitz's patents seem to have ample income and social support as they age. Going back to graduate school at age 70 calls for not only health, but also some financial reserves. Many of the elderly lack funds and many are estranged from family, with few close friends.<br />Medical care is cold, impersonal and often wasteful under the best of conditions. Try seeking medical services when you're not accompanied by a six-foot, able-bodied son or a daughter who just happens to be an attorney! Lipschitz's examples seem to live in a well-cushioned vacuum, and that perhaps is what's missing in an otherwise strong contribution.e-destroying conditions, such as hearing and sight impairment.

I must admit I'm somewhat biased against &quot;big&quot; self-help authors. However, Richard Carlson knows his (pardon the expression) stuff.<br />His recommendations, couched in the language of self-help, derive from solid psychological research.<br />Small stuff is defined as whatever won't be important in six months or a year. However, to his credit, and unlike many cheery self-help authors and coaches, Carlson admits that sometimes you can't go home again.<br />Some of the chapters offer straightforward, not especially original self-help, but the book is worth the read. The most helpful chapters focus on the need to &quot;beware&quot; a &quot;busy  mind.&quot; Solutions come from staying calm.<br />I concur! Often I find myself telling clients, &quot;Take a break from thinking about this decision,&quot; and now I can refer them to Carlson's Big Stuff book.<br />You won't find &quot;be happy&quot; platitudes here, and that's a plus.<br />Carlson writes well and he's convincing.  Even if you've seen some of this before (&quot;shift perspective&quot; &quot;take time to heal&quot;), Carlson gathers these ideas together in a new way. I would recommend this book to anyone who's going through some &quot;big stuff.&quot;	2003-01-14

That's important to get out of the way.  As other reviewers have observed, you won't find plans or guidance for your own career move.<br />Instead, Bronson offers a jumble of anecdotes, unsystematic and uneven -- just the sort of stories I hear every day as a career coach. People seek new adventures. They weigh the cost (and there always is a cost). Sometimes they decide the cost is too high and they back down. Sometimes they leap and experience disappointment. And sometimes they leap and find themselves soaring.<br />Career-changers are hungry for guidance. Bronson's interviewees often sought his approval -- and his advice. He insists that he's not a career counselor but they asked anyway.  This quest for help is typical during any life transition and underscores the need to be cautious about seeking help from whoever happens to show up.<br />And of course this overlap of roles can be viewed as a flaw in the book. Bronson admits lapsing from the journalist role.  He gets so involved with his interviewees that the story becomes a quest, a journey-across-the-country story rather than an analysis of career choices. Bronson includes his own story, told in pieces throughout the book.  This feature seemed to interrupt the flow: if the author tells his own story, we should be led to anticipate autobiography.<br />Despite these flaws, Bronson comes up with some sound insights into career change. He observes that people avoid change because of the accompanying loss of identity. They hang back &quot;because they don't want to be the kind of person who abandons friends and takes up with a new crowd,&quot; precisely what you have to do following a life transition.<br />And he follows up with a warning of solitude that also accompanies any life change. &quot;Get used to being alone,&quot; he advises, yet many people fear being alone more than they fear being stuck in a job they hate.<br />WHAT SHOULD I DO WITH MY LIFE offers questions, not answers. It's like attending a giant networking event. You have to sort through the stories on your own.<br />Despite these flaws, I will recommend this book to my clients and to other career coaches. Career change, like any change, is messy. You rarely get to move in a straight line and you always experience pain and loss.  And every move is a roll of the dice: a coach can help, but there are no guarantees.<br /><br />Each story in this book is unique and your own will be too.

Books on writing can be categorized as \\"how to get it published,\\" \\"how to write,\\" and \\"how to be motivated to write.\\" This book fits the last -- and perhaps most popular -- category.<br />See's thesis seems to be that one becomes a writer by acting like a writer. That means (as a minimum) writing a thousand words a day -- and sending a nice note to a published writer or editor, thanking him or her for the reading experience.<br />As a published author myself (Making the big move and some ebooks) I would not be overjoyed to receive notes from aspiring writers, especially those written on \\"nice paper.\\" Just buy the book and write a nice review on amazon.com if you liked it!<br />However, most of See's ideas are valuable and even original, despite the thousands of writer-motivation books out there. Rejection, she says, is a process -- that's all, a necessary part of being a writer. True.<br />Her discussion of affirmations makes sense, even though it is easy to dismiss affirmations as part of New Age woo-woo. Anyone who writes has to drown out the critical voices and affirmations, as a way of redirecting one's thoughts, can be helpful. And some of her specific ideas -- e.g., how to write a magazine article -- are extremely valuable.<br />If you, or someone you know, needs motivation, this book might be helpful. Then again, as Lawrence Block wrote many years ago, why force yourself? There are lots of writers out there and there are more books than any of us will have time to read.<br />Don't want to write? No problem! Go off and mow a lawn, read someone else's book to your child, or take the dog for a walk.	2003-01-14

Some generalizations simply do not apply to Silver City.  For example, it is not necessary to join a church (or country club) in order to fit in here. Even a small community like ours has diverse sub-populations: recent retirees, most of whom have some affinity for the arts; old-timers, most of whom are the conservative church-goers Crampton describes; and Hispanic families, many of whom have worked in the mines.<br />These groups rarely interact, although we usually get along very peacefully. We also have a number of folks who teach at the university -- and we rarely see them around town.<br />To learn about Silver city, you won't get much information from the Chamber of Commerce or the editor of the newspaper. You'd do better to spend some time hanging out at the AIR cafe, talking to whoever comes in. The morning and afternoon groups are quite different and everyone is friendly.<br />The author gives some nuts and bolts about each small town. Unfortunately, with the exception of weather, much of this information will change by the time the book is printed. And your decision may well be made by factors that can't be added up.<br />The best part of the book is the section on economics of small town living. Here, he's right on. You have to budget for travel to a large city now and then. Air travel will be more costly and you need time to drive to a large airport.  His view of housing prices seems optimistic. If you move to a desirable city (such as Silver City) expect to pay more for a house than he allows.<br />And if you move to retire, your economic picture will be quite different. Many newcomers to Silver City are beginning a second career as an artist or writer. Moving without a job is scary -- and I do not recommend it unless you fit the profile I describe in my own book, Making the Big Move.Moving without a job is scary -- and I do not recommend it unless you fit the profile I describe in my own book, Making the Big Move.	2003-01-07

Alex receives a \\"murder book\\" from a mysterious source and turns to his old friend, Milo, to solve the mystery of where this book came from and what it means.<br />The two become obsessed with a never-solved murder, which Milo remembers from his early days on the force. As other reviewers point out, we learn more about Milo's early struggles as a gay cop in Los Angeles.<br />Kellerman's pacing is flawless, as usual. Suspense is his forte as a writer. He draws on his own background as a clinical psychologist as we visit a home for children we would now call \\"learning-disabled.\\" And the pairing of a psychologist who understands the Internet as well as the human mind, with a police officer who can tap the resources of the police files, produces results.<br />The only sour note for me was Kellerman's estrangement from Robin, his long-time girlfriend. Robin has always seemed a shadowy character who doesn't really contribute to the novels. Let's face it, readers tend to like heroes who are bachelors. It's no accident that Kinsey Milhone is allergic to marriage.<br />In my opinion, the only \\"significant others\\" who work  well are Susan Silverman, Spenser's long-time girlfriend, and Hy Ripinsky, Sharon McCone's significant other.  They're three-dimensional and flawed, like the heroes themselves.<br />Given Kellerman's background, it is tempting to note that the women in his books tend to fit the madonna... dichotomy: they're pure and good or aggressive temptresses. The dialogues<br />between Alex and Robin are realistic -- and that makes them boring to read.  Robin's on a bus with a bunch of production people and their dogs -- surely there's a way to make that interesting!<br />I gave this book four stars because it is, after all, a good read. Sometimes you want a book to help you survive a dreary plane ride or a long wait in a professional office.  You want something that will draw you into the plot and distract you from your surroundings. Murder Book fills that need very nicely, with more intelligence than many of the competing options.the plot and distract you from your surroundings.

Pepper Keane is a former federal prosecutor, now a private investigator living in a cabin near Boulder, Colorado. Jayne, an attractive math professor, hires Pepper to learn what links the deaths of three prominent specialists in the narrow field of fractal mathematics. Law enforcement authorities failed to find links among the three, but Pepper and his computer-wizard friend find clues and pursue the trail to a surprising end.<br />Along the way, we learn a lot about fractals, existential philosophy, and the inner workings of a complicated PI. Keane takes medication for depression and has a mysterious arrest in his pre-detective past.<br />Fractal Murders reminded me a little of mystery series about math and economics professors -- but Fractal Murders is better. As a former academic myself, I can say that he gets the academic setting 99% right. He does for Boulder what Susan Conant has done for Cambridge: lovingly accept and lightly tease a place that takes itself very, very seriously.<br />Fractal Murders held my interest. As an avid mystery fan, I often stop reading after the first thirty pages and sneak a peak at the ending. Not here! I was genuinely interested in learning more about the characters and content to follow the author's energetic pace.<br />Author Mark Cohen can write. He creates characters, evokes atmosphere and sustains suspense. Perhaps the biggest mystery is, why didn't he present this book to a major publisher for wider distribution? Or if he did, why didn't they take it? And when do we get the sequel? I want to spend more time with Pepper Keane.	2002-12-13

Even if your creation is a business or a marketing plan, not a book or a painting, this book will offer rare and helpful insights.<br />Maisel argues that creatives become depressed when they lack meaning in their lives. Drugs? A review of the past? Possibly helpful but, for most creatives, depression will be alleviated when people learn to find meaning in what they do. Given the rejections and setbacks of the creative life, Maisel's message is, \\"Find meaning in what you create, regardless of whether you find a buyer....<br />And the book is realistic: some people have to come to terms with creating art as a sideline, not a main source of income. We could have learned much more about this difficult topic.<br />As other reviewers have noted, this book is considerably stronger on insight than on guidance. We get page after page of notes from other \\"creativity coaches,\\" presumably trained by Maisel. I found myself skipping those accounts after awhile, which left a fairly thin book.  After all, we buy a book to gain the author's expertise -- not a series of anecdotes by those who have not traveled as far on the knowledge highway.<br />The author urges us to come up with a mission statement for ourselves along with a series of \\"core operating principles.\\" In practice, I have found this prescription difficult to follow for myself and my own clients. A life purpose tends to evolve out of one's own experience and I believe we gain purpose from serendipitous discovery, not from sitting down to set guidelines.<br />Despite these concerns, I recommend this book for the gems that can be found, especially in the first part of the book.  Understanding the source of creative depression is a good first step. Unfortunately, it is only the first step, and we could  use a lot more follow-up.<br />I also can't help noticing that Van Gogh Blues communicates nearly the same message as The Artist's Way by Julia Cameron, just packaged differently. The message of \\"show up\\" and \\"it takes less energy to do the work than to resist\\" appears in both sources.<br />A blocked creative -- the target of Cameron's work -- seems to resemble the depressed creative that Maisel writes about. Some readers will undoubtedly prefer one approach to the other.Way by Julia Cameron, just packaged differently.

This book serves up an African cozy -- a heart-felt book about a world the author clearly loves and admires. The heroine owns a detective agency in Botswwana and, as the book opens, has become engaged to a kind gentleman who owns an auto repair garage. Just how kind is he? Well, let's say this book shows us warm-hearted generosity without descending into maudlin sentiment.<br />The mystery itself -- what happened to a young American who disappeared ten years ago -- allows the author to maintain suspense. We genuinely care about the crime and we observe the heroine's search for a solution. At the same time, the detective agency gets involved in a more routine &quot;who's cheating on who&quot; marital case. While the ending is not a satisfying solution to a problem, the handling of both cases demonstrates the heroine's talent for combining compassion with justice.<br />Books in exotic settings often don't work, but this one does -- splendidly. I am reminded of both M.C. Beaton series -- Hamish McBeth and Agatha Raisin -- but this book actually has less of an &quot;edge&quot; and the humor is more subtle.  Tears of the Giraffe goes beyond cozy into a sub-genre of the &quot;gentle&quot; book -- not a tear-jerker and always respectful of the characters and setting.	2002-12-10

I suspect the major publishers were nervous (if indeed they saw this book at all) because, as another reviewer said, the book is difficult to categorize. A book of essays? Sounds dreary.<br />Yet Seasons is one of the liveliest, most insightful career books available. As a career coach, I frequently cite Gail's story of being asked to cover for a project-botching colleague. The man was paid a stipend but everyone knew he would do a bad job -- so the administration asked Gail to give up her summer research quarter (for which she was not paid) and do the job -- for no compensation of course!<br />As a former college professor myself, I can relate to Gail's stories of second-class treatment in academia. She triumphed and became a department head -- but the frustrations never go away completely. Male colleagues interrupt her office hours and her classes. I've had similar experiences.<br />Some of the best essays in the book deal with Gail's classroom experiences as she teaches literature to undergraduates. In fact, I think she would do better to put together a collection of those experiences and sell them as a book. Her discussion of The Color Purple and her analysis of a Rita Snow poem are worth the price of the book. She makes literature come alive and we see why she is such a gifted teacher.<br />If you can get a copy of this book, send it to anyone who's entering academia, especially women. And if you like literature and want to share Gail's exuberance, that's another reason to track down this book and buy it.	2002-11-30

While in high school, he saw his first Benedictines and decided that he belonged with them. He showed remarkable maturity as he chose a specific abbey to enter, right out of college, and chose to become a brother rather than a priest.<br />The author's goal seems to be a modest one. He describes his life in a monastery and how he got to be there. He offers hilarious stories of characters he meets along the way -- not always the easiest men to live with, but definitely a source of spiritual challenge.<br />Brother Benet can write. Each chapter is a self-contained essay, reminiscent of James Herriot. In fact, one of the most appealing chapters includes a description of \\"Katie the collie\\" and the efforts of the brothers to create a properly monastic canine.<br />Reading between the lines, Brother Benet seems to have the perfect quietly cheerful temperament to live in community. He finds humor in frustrating events and as well as changes in monastic life: don't miss the reference to \\"liturgical lingerie.\\"  In telling his story, he has the advantage of someone who dealt with visitors, and he remains aware of an outsider's perspective. He tells us, without fuss, of his own struggles and also his ownn joys.<br />Brother Benet also allows a glimpse of life in a contemporary monastery. In some ways, the \\"confreres\\" come across as a special fraternity. Watching a television show, they act like any group of males, using less than religious language. Yet there is caring, not only for themselves, for for those whose lives have touched the monastery. When a former postulant lies dying of AIDS, the monastery sends two brothers to be with him. And when two strangers, clad only in sheets, make the monastery a stop on their unique pilgrimage, the monks offer a washing machine as well as a room and meals.<br />As a career coach, I hear people talk about finding meaning in their lives. Here's someone who has found meaning in a particularly unusual and dedicated way.  Reading this book helps define the concept of \\"vocation\\" and \\"calling,\\" although the vast majority of us will not find ourselves called so openly to such an extreme. Brother Benet offes an insightful non-New-Age perspective on spirituality, purpose and yes, abundance.ularly unusual and dedicated way.

Along the way, I gained a unique perspective on contemporary religion.<br />Fried is a masterful, professional journalist -- fanatical about accuracy, novelistic in style. He does not serve up composite people: everyone is real and only a few names are disguised. His gift is to keep the pages turning as we wonder, \\"How will this dilemma get resolved?\\"<br />His writing offers entertainment, particularly through his use of fresh metaphors and analogies. Repeatedly he refers to the retail level of religion -- a particularly apt metaphor, because the world Fried describes is unabashedly a business. As other reviewers have noted, the process resembles choosing a new corporate leader or (I would add) a university dean. Image matters: the committee dismisses one rabbi because he lacks a sense of style in the way he wears his head covering! And the congregation, which includes a healthy share of Philadelphia lawyers, does not believe any governing body can deny them the rabbi they want. Anything is negotiable!<br />to differentiate<br />Anthropology teaches us to differentiate between dogma religions (such as Catholicism and most Protestant sects) and tribal religions. In the latter, religious customs are developed and maintained to unify the participants and mark them as different from others.<br />Without this understanding, much of what Fried describes would have been baffling. Fried presents a membership that resembles a community not of believers but of heritage. People know each other. They went to camp together. They're more than friends.<br />And we learn a lot by what Fried doesn't say. As an outsider, I found myself wondering, \\"Where are the women? the single people? the non-traditional lifestyles?\\"  Women can serve on committees but the real power remains with the men. Single people are mentioned only briefly in the context of \\"mixers.\\" No one in Fried's world seems to believe that someone might choose to live alone, or with a same-sex partner, or without children. And no one moves, loses a job, faces financial disaster, or even lives with the aftermath of divorce.  Membership is described by numbers of \\"families.\\"  No loners here!<br />Fried describes a group of people who have education and wealth and know how to maximize their resources. They contribute money to charities but their own troubles cause only embarrassment. Health problems are tragic but these people do not stand in line at HMO's.  The only names not revealed are those of \\"Landis\\" family, whose child uses a religious ceremony to insult her mother. The matter is treated like a gaffe at the Junior League, not a reason to delve deeper into the mission of the organization that produced the dysfunctional family.<br />Fried writes an insider as well as a journalist, and the book has qualities of a memoir.  While we gain some insights to his own psyche, we lose the context of the bigger picture: why is this important? Insiders don't ask -- but not all readers are insiders.<br />Fried devotes less than two pages to examples of friends who turned to religion as adults -- and these were anecdotal, random stories.  We get a sense of an institution run by middle-aged, wealth white males, mostly for the purpose of maintaining a tradition. Fried does a good job of explaining the dynamics of the synagogue and its search for a new rabbi, but I would have liked to see him place the question in the context of American -- and even global -- society today.mentioned only briefly in the context of \\"mixers.\\" No one in Fried's world seems to believe that someone might choose to live alone, or with a same-sex partner, or without children.

Ignoring the shelves of self-help books, the thousands of websites of potential helpers, they take the plunge and never recover.<br />Margaret, who teaches English in a Manhattan private school, begins to wonder, \\"Where has my life gone?\\" Like many midlife career changers who ask this question for the first time, she wants an instant answer.And she comes up with one: She will take a year off and write a best-selling novel.<br />Never mind the reality: she has never sold so much as a short story. She has no idea where to begin. She has no back-up plan and no idea what it's like to stay home chained to a word processor.<br />Let the folly commence! and it does.<br />Author Schwarz mericlessly shows Margaret's creative ways to avoid her self-chosen mission: cleaning the house, painting the walls, buying multicolored pencils, even buying a book of names to bestow appropriate descriptors on her soon-to-be-created characters.<br />And she unerringly portrays the advice given to wannabe writers from those who have never written a line: \\"I read that Hemingway always left his work in mid-sentence;\\" \\"Write the first third and the rest will be easier,\\" and more.<br />Schwarz accurately depicts what happens to those who blithely jump into a dream without a well-crafted safety net. Doors mysteriously close and bank accounts disappear faster than you expect.  I am, however, surprised that Margaret's budget-driven husband would support this venture. Ted keeps detailed \\"ledgers\\" and has a knack for asking penetrating questions.  How did he miss the big one?<br />Meanwhile, Letty, in Los Angeles, succumbs to her husband's new job and dazzling new salary. Always carefree with their spending, the couple happily builds their dream on a foundation of plastic.<br />Letty's new world appears, finely detailed, through her emails. Margaret helps herself to Letty's writing talent which, we soon realize, is probably greater than Margaret's own.<br />Letty's greed and concern with image seems realistic and inevitable: a naive housewife plunged into a world she can't comprehend, where she doesn't know how to say \\"no.\\"<br />Yet what I can't understand is why Letty keeps turning to Margaret, in a world where therapists abound on every corner. And a couple in their income bracket would be expected to have a financial planner. Then again, perhaps they moved too fast to learn the ropes along the way. Often midlife career changers brag about how much they earned but when asked, \\"How long can you live before you lose the house?\\" they sheepishly say, \\"I've saved up three months,\\" or even, \\"Maybe a week or two.\\"<br />Margaret tries to help Letty, with predictable results. Soon Letty seizes what seems to be an unexpected windfall, and both friends are condemned (in one case, literally) to live out the consequences of their decisions.<br />The end seems fast and unsatisfying, with no hope of redemption or growth for either character.

So I must admit I opened this book with misgivings: would Beaumont's presence dilute the tone and style of the Joanna Brady character?<br />To my surprise, Beaumont's addition actually allows the reader to observe new dimensions of Joanna Brady. He provides a foil that may be missing in the rest of the series. He's tough and hard-edged; she's a good cop who takes the day off when her daughter's dog dies. He is alone in the world; she is smothered in family.<br />Actually, Joanna's character has always seemed somewhat one-dimensional to me -- certainly not as deep as other female heroines, such as Anna Pigeon or Sharon McCone (especially in later novels) or Kate Shugack.  She's a sheriff and a mom, doing a good job with both. She has an interfering mother and great in-laws. But how did she get to be such a good sheriff -- by living with her father and husband? By drawing on her former skills as an office manager?<br />And what conflicts does she face, internally or externally? In this book, her new husband, Butch, gets frustrated by her schedule (didn't he think about this before they got married?) and wants to put electric trains in their future family room.  Um...so what?<br />Joanna's story is told in third person, as usual, creating further distance. Beaumont, narrating in first person, is the sad detective with a past, trying to find a new job in the unfortunately named Special Unit.<br />The story is a classic whodunit: Woman found dead, boyfriend first suspect, but victim's ties to out-of-state crime soon become evident -- and, I think, a little far-fetched.  There's not much mystery and we soon realize who committed the crime.<br />What Jance does best is create the setting in Bisbee, Arizona. Seen through Beaumont's citified eyes, we seem to be joining him as he walks through the main street and expresses the usual city-dweller's surprise at small-town life in the west.<br />What keeps the pages turning is Jance's seamless writing. There is just enough suspense to want to keep going. And, more important, we come to like the characters and want to spend more time with them.<br />I do not agree with reviewers who want to see further pairing of Brady and Beaumont. The success of their partnership -- from a reader's standpoint -- comes from the conflict between them.<br />Beaumont expects a small-town, innocent female who needs guidance and Brady expects an arrogant out-of-towner who wants to put her in her place. Once they start to build a friendship, the tension disappears and we have yet another nice person in Joanna Brady's life.  Just what we don't need!/>What keeps the pages turning is Jance's seamless writing. There is just enough suspense to want to keep going.

We're just beginning to see books about women's basketball, and this is one that should not be missed. Nice Girls Finish First is the story Notre Dame's championship year.<br />As the title hints, Notre Dame attracts athletes who are all-around people. Everybody goes to class and many athletes take a full, demanding schedule. One athlete chooses Notre Dame because &quot;it's even better on the inside&quot; than its shiny image on the outside.<br />The team consists of hardworking over-achiever. Like most basketball players, many girls came from difficult homes and overcame obstacles to get to college, let alone play on a championship team.<br />So here is the story of how a college team that has always been in the background can step  up to the championships. It's a story of each player and a coach with a thoroughly modern marriage who wants to gain a bigger place for her team -- and respect for women's basketball everywhere.<br />The book delivers basketball suspense -- but heart-warming scenes too. The team returns to South Bend after the championship game -- and the whole school is waiting to greet them in the middle of the night. And after winning a game, there's Ruth Riley, talking quietly with her mother in an empty gym. After watching a semi final on television, a male crowd from the sports bar decides to drive all night to see the finals.<br />I wish this book were more widely distributed.

Q is for Quarry is a new take on a familiar theme.<br />Two aging cops, friends of Kinsey Milhone, want to solve a fifteen year old puzzle: a girl's body was found in Lompoc, California.The body was never identified and the murder never solved.<br />Grafton keeps the suspense flowing more than she has in some books. The action doesn't stop. It's a straightforward mystery and an alert reader will pick up clues -- although not necessarily identify the killer.<br />We learn a little more about Kinsey's long-lost family. Her two partners -- retired cops -- are fighting life-threatening illnesses and one discovers the joy of junk food.  Grafton's strength comes in plot and setting. She describes everyone the heroine meets in excruciating detail.  Outward appearances hold clues to personality, as we realize from the great portrait painters.<br />Kinsey has her usual quirks: she dresses down and she lives small and cheap.  Here she's totally unattached and she likes it that way. She doesn't age and she's still using a typewriter sometime in the 80's. I must admit I kept looking for anachronism: were Sauconys the shoe of choice back then? I must admit I wish the author had aged Kinsey and brought her into the present, so we could get a sense of depth by growing with her.<br />This is a female tough detective story. We don't get into the deeper nuances of personality, as we do with heroines of Nevada Barr or Margaret Maron -- or even Marcia Muller. Spenser, Robert Parker's hero, is more sensitive.  You get an old-fashioned quick read with no great lessons about life -- just the thrill of the chase and a great relief, at the end, that your own world isn't populated by the people Kinsey encounters in her frequent brushes with murder witnesses.	2002-11-16

The writing is magnificent: lots of little gems, some of which might get censored in an online review. Don't miss her description of hanging out in the kitchen with her inlaws at Christmas.<br />This book can be read on several levels. I must admit I was exhausted at first, just reading about Kate's efforts to juggle her life. Being single and childless, I can only admire the fortitude of working mothers who really do try to \\"do everything.\\" And I was disappointed in the ending, where Kate does seem to walk away from a part of herself.<br />I couldn't help wishing this couple would go to marriage counseling! Kate and her husband seem to have different values and her abrasiveness can be annoying, even to the reader who is rooting for her. Marriages like this one -- very strong wife, kind supportive husband -- ususally do not last without outside help.<br />I also wanted to encourage Kate to hire a coach to help her set priorities and develop somem assertiveness. Her friend and colleague at work, Candy, even teases her about being too quick to say yes and to accept tough jobs with no compensation.  When Kate says, \\"Nobody got bonuses,\\" Candy says, \\"And you believe that?\\" Either Candy is a saboteur rather than a true friend, or Kate has contributed to her own powerlessness.<br />While some women (and men) will be appalled at the crudity of Kate's boss, I think the author is just being realistic. The securities industry was always known for its machismo, as described in Michael Lewis's Liar's Poker.  A senior woman like Kate will have less access to legalistic harassment remedies than a clerk-typist -- and Kate makes this point herself. She has to choose:  a job or a lawsuit. The fact that her boss is an Australian adds to the realism: the author understands the male-female dynamic of \\"down under.\\"<br />Even if you get frustrated, it will be hard to stop turning the pages. There is suspense created by the author (\\"How will Kate get out of this mess?\\") but, more important, the underlying theme: How much of Kate's stress is created by her dual roles -- and how much by her own assertiveness and coping skills?will be hard to stop turning the pages.

This book is a small gem -- a rare combination of heart-warming story and solid history.<br />  North Platte, Nebraska, is truly middle-of-nowhere.  In the 1940's, however, thousands of people came through North Platte on cross-country trains.  And during World War II, more than six million GI's came through North Platte on troop trains.<br /> And here's the miracle.During the war, this tiny town transformed its modest depot into a canteen for soldiers, sailors and airmen passing through on the trains. With no government aid (President Roosevelt sent five dollars), people from the town met every train with baskets of home-made food, farm produce, good coffee and milk. They were &quot;on duty&quot; 24/7, as we would say today.<br /><br /> Train movements were supposed to be secret, but after awhile the railroad staff would spread the word.  GI's, mostly teenagers dazed by their new world, remembered North Platte for the rest of their lives. Of course, most of the servers were women, and that was a gentler time.  One local group made popcorn balls, with tiny pieces of paper holding names of local girls who could write to the men. Many friendships and at least one marriage resulted.<br /><br /> North Platte was a small miracle. The town became a legend among servicemen overseas. And it was truly a miracle born of its own time.  It couldn't happen now, one of the aging residents said. Nowadays everyone would stay home and watch the war on television.<br />World War II buffs,  admirers of Tom Brokaw's The Greatest Generation, and nostalgia fans would welcome this book as a holiday gift.	2002-11-11

However, my book group in Tucson chose the selection so I dutifully read the whole thing as carefully as possible.<br />You cannot read this book for plot. There is no plot. You can't read for character. All characters are viewed through the eyes of the narrator, a thoroughly unlikeable man who has come to the country to write and to heal himself from other writing disasters.<br />The book can be intensely frustrating. The narrator lives in his own head. I've known others like him -- people who respond to every person and place intellectually.  Unlike an anthropologist, he is not trying to understand the culture of those he meets. Rather each individual is put under the narrator's verbal microscope, dissected on the basis of external appearance. We learn that a gardener always dresses up formally and changes clothes with seasons -- but we do not know why. We observe the comings and goings of the village people and the narrator's landlord -- but we do not understand their hearts, minds or motives.<br />The narrator's distance ultimately comes across as hostile superiority. He does not belong here in this house in the country and he knows he will never fit in. Yet he never allows himself to have a genuine reaction to what he experiences. His encounter with the English countryside is filtered through the writers and artists he knows: Wordsworth, Constable, and more.<br />Amazingly, we keep turning the pages. Naipul violates every rule of writing. He tells rather than shows. He does not build suspense. The characters do not evoke sympathy. Yet Naipul's command of language keep the reader turning the pages, even when he launches into long descriptions of country places.<br />It's about language, not plot.<br />The ending of the book yields the greatest insight. We realize the narrator has become a man without a country, at home nowhere. He sees his own rituals through the eyes of a stranger.  It is sad and, perhaps, inevitable. But in the end I, as a reader, was as detached from the narrator as he was from his own environment.d, perhaps, inevitable.

However, once I picked up this book, I got hooked!<br />When Cody's \\"mom\\" died, Cody inherited the magnificent suite at a luxury hotel where he had been living for many years. The author creates a legal scenario that, while not likely, is certainly plausible. Cody will remain in the suite, paying the going rate from his trust fund. Each night the hotel will try to find him a roommate (Cody hates to be alone) who will get free occupancy of the suite on condition of sharing with the dog. The General Manager is reluctant, but money -- and the threat of the money moving to another hotel -- convinces everyone to accept this unusual arrangement.<br />Cody can understand conversation around him, as well as speech of dogs and cats he encounters. His loveable personality encourages guests to talk to him. Cody learns a lot about the guests and they, in turn, find their lives changing after a night in the suite. Cody sometimes helps the situation along.  He listens but he can't talk and never steps outside the physical limitations of the canine species.  Only one guest seems able to hear Cody and carry on a real conversation, but the others feel Cody's love and are inspired.<br />It's a feel-good story, no doubt about it, on the order of Miracle at St Cecilia's. We learn what the dog thinks, as we do in the Midnight Louie series (Carol Nelson Douglas) or the Mrs. Murphy series (Rita Mae Brown). Cody reaches out to those who are homeless and orphaned. There's only one villain or threat to Cody and the evil stays hidden, like the backstairs region of the hotel itself.<br />This author, Linda Stubbs, can write. Either she had a good editor or she's a natural. I didn't find myself mentally crossing out excess lines. Her dialogue is flawless. She creates a \\"voice\\" for<br />the dog that is uniquely his and she captures the different personalities that move around him.  And she keeps the emotional suspense up throughout the book: we have romantic liaisons and we can't help wondering what will happen to those we meet.<br />If this edition had been packaged with more elegance, we would be reading it at the browsing tables of leading bookstores. It's not for everyone. But if you have someone on your gift list who's an absolute fanatic about dogs, someone who has to be reminded, \\"He's only a dog!\\" I recommend this book.

Wisely she encourages readers to seek help from qualified therapists if personal issues cloud their careers -- but she is not afraid to tackle the tough emotional questions.<br />And her analysis of emotions would do credit to any personality or social psychologist. Fear, for instance, may not be fear at all.<br />Perhaps the best parts of the book are the chapter on intuition (a gem) and the five chapters that address the four stages of career change. Beck's view of intuition is sensible -- not New Age woo-woo but a way to gain deeper insight into our own motives.  And describing the stages of transition, Beck gives us realistic indicators (those in phase 2 typically change their appearance!) as well as warnings about what to expect.<br />It's easy to miss the message between the lines, but Beck does hint that the path of change will not be an easy one. Unlike many authors, she dispenses with false cheer and hints of pain and sacrifice along the way.  Change isn't magical. It can happen -- but you have to be realistic about yourself and your objectives.<br />That's a message I try to share with all my clients -- and I've sold so many copies of this book by word of mouth, I've been tempted to claim a share of the royalties. Don't miss it.	2002-11-06

Katherine Valentine sets her first novel in a tiny New England town -- one that seems even smaller than Silver City and certainly more homogeneous. St. Cecilia's church fills a critical role in the lives of many townspeople, even those who aren't Catholic. They face problems ranging from life-threatening (beloved husband Bob  Peterson needs a bone marrow transplant to live) to semi-comic (teenager Matthew Metcalf has been suspended from high school after hacking the teacher evaluation files).<br />Father James Flaherty must announce the Archbishop's decision to close St. Cecilia's on Easter Sunday: the building needs expensive repairs and attendance is dwindling.  Flaherty will be transferred, the eighty-two-year-old former pastor will be placed in a far-away nursing, and parishioners will be swallowed up by the five thousand members of a nearby congregation.<br />The book's title, as well as the delightful primitive-art style cover, give away the ending. We know that the church will be saved or else the loss will be turned to triumph. We know everyone will have a happy ending.<br />Still Valentine masterfully provides suspense on every page with the one question remaining: How will we achieve a happy ending while maintaining a twentieth century credibility? While the ending does require a couple of coincidences -- plausible, but not likely -- the author's ability to pull together the diverse strands of the story is the real miracle. It's a feel-good story that made me wish Bing Crosby could play the leading role.<br />In an endnote, Valentine suggests the story was inspired by her own near-death experience and was written to create a miracle in her own life. Therefore, it's understandable that portions of the book (easily skipped by the uninterested reader) offer a hard sell on the Catholic religion that will remind older readers of The Silver Chalice or the final pages of Brideshead Revisited.  A few pages, such as Father Flaherty's deathbed discussion, could have been omitted.<br />Still, this well-written book offers escape entertainment as well as a message that will be welcomed by many who want to go back to the basics. At times I felt as if I had walked into a Norman Rockwell painting, but the lively style and sympathetic characters keep the pages turning.  This book will find a place on many Christmas gift lists -- but I'd choose the recipient with care.have been omitted.<br />Still, this well-written book offers escape entertainment as well as a message that will be welcomed by many who want to go back to the basics.

Reading Greeley is like drinking champagne: a frothy concoction that perfectly complements an evening of escape. Here Greeley's customary Irish charm competes with Gallic savoir-faire.  We are introduced to the Paris of the protected visitor with translators, tucked-away hotels and famous restaurants.<br />Greeley's series hero, Bishop Blackie Ryan, is on a mission for &quot;Cardinal Sean:&quot; find Jean-Claude, a young Dominican priest who vanished without a trace while conducting visitors around cathedral ruins. Jean-Claude had a popular television program and was much admired by the students and nuns who were his ministry, yet everyone saw him differently, and all agreed he had mysterious depths and a magical smile.<br />Bishop Blackie has a gift for unearthing hidden depths in people as well as clues for his investigation. Befriending a young woman who seems out of place as a Cathedral beggar, he enlists her help in tracing the young priest who often seemed equally out of place as a Dominican priest.<br /><br />The story line has the fascination of a moderately difficult crossword puzzle, the kind you know you can solve if you just put in the time.  It also has about as much action and cliff-hanging action -- and short-term satisfaction as the Sunday crossword.  Greeley gives us the world as we would like it to be, where problems are solved by a convenient phone call to Chicago and a couple of FedEx packages, and even the Cardinal benevolently distinguishes the Christian from the Church.<br />As Greeley is careful to note in an afterward, this is a tale of fiction. Unlike many readers, I was surprised by the ending, which fit the clues but seemed highly implausible.  I will say only that Greeley gets the chance to share his very politically correct, enlightened views of the Church and the world.  And he might encourage us all to beware of reading our own beliefs into situations that are not what they seem.<br />I'm not usually a fan of Bishop Blackie -- but I liked this one!I liked this one!	2002-11-06

His memoir tells the story of his childhood and early college years in Hungary. Grove survived World War II and emigrated to the United States following the Revolution.<br />Andrew's parents seem remarkably strong.  His family enjoyed a comfortable life as owners of a dairy business. His father survived, improbably, a stint in a prison camp during World War II and later saw the business dissolve into state ownership.  His mother's spirit kept him alive during the War.<br />Both parents worked hard but gave Andrew what we would call &quot;quality time.&quot; Even when money was tight, he had English and music lessons.<br />After reading so many stories of growing-up-in-wartime-Europe, I was surprised to find myself drawn into the story. I wanted to keep reading and actually wish the book had continued into Andrew's early years.<br />What works is Grove's straightforward, matter-of-fact style. He conveys a sense of, &quot;I did what had to be done,&quot; with no time wasted on emotional fallout. As a result, his story can seem cold.<br />For instance, when escaping from the Austrian countryside to Vienna, Grove and his boyhood friend decide to leave early to avoid &quot;procedures&quot; of the local gendarmes. They do not awaken the two girls who traveled with them from Hungary, and these girls are never mentioned again. Indeed, the only women Grove mentions are his mother, his occasional dates and -- in two sentences -- his wife and daughters.<br />Apart from the compelling narrative, Grove's book shows how qualities of a future CEO emerge in childhood.  Grove continually sought to learn and grow. At one point he even signed up for singing lessons. He had a clear sense of what he wanted and seemed to take for granted his success in school, particularly his talent for chemistry.  Ironically, surviving in a Communist society turned out to be excellent preparation for capitalist corporate life. Both, for example, punish those who speak too freely.<br />Grove's teachers predicted his success. The book's title comes from a teacher's prediction that Grove would &quot;swim across&quot; the river out of Hungary to success. Grove did swim across, and eventually he was able to fly.life.

Here she introduces us to Molly Murphy, a turn-of-the-century Irish lass who moves to New York under the most unusual circumstances. Fleeing the police after she accidentally kills an abusive suitor, she is asked to accompany two children to America when their mother cannot meet the health requirements for emigration.<br /> A man is murdered when the ship docks in Ellis Island. Molly was seen arguing with the man, and she has  even more motive for murder than the police realize.  To save herself and her new shipboard friend, Molly ventures into some unsavory neighborhoods and asks impertinent questions.<br /> Bowen is an experienced writer who knows how to keep her characters moving smoothly.  The solution of the crime, as well as Molly's new romatic interest, rely a little too much on coincidence. Yet the potentially grim setting is leavened by Bowen's understated humor and the pages turn quickly.  Readers who appreciate good writing, historical detail and an undemanding plot will not be disappointed.	2002-11-06

Albert's popular heroine, China Bayles, left her criminal law career to open an herb shop in a small Texas town. Here China leaves her home and her new husband to answer a plea from her mother, Leatha, at the family plantation in Mississippi.<br />China finds her great-aunt has finally become too ill to run the business. A man has produced a deed claiming ownership to the family property. When he is found dead, China must look in the past for answers, to protect her family and her long-ago friends.<br />What seemed to be a long-ago dream turns out to hold the key to the interlocking mysteries of family, property and murder.  Albert evokes the steamy summers and equally steamy secrets of life in a family that takes its dysfunctional qualities from the post-Civil War southern culture.<br />The narrative moves swiftly, except for the many details about China's family tree that are needed to understand clues, red herrings and an ultimately satisfying ending. China's detective work, made easier by friendships formed in childhood, solves the crime. However, the family's secrets are unraveled by documents that literally turn up when China needs them most.<br />The focus on history does take away the uniqueness of China's character, which blossoms in her home setting. At times I thought I was reading about Shankman's heroine, Samantha. And the uniquely southern blend of supernatural, dreams and real life reminded me of McCrumb's folksong series.<br />Then again, people often lose part of themselves when they return home for a visit. Although Bloodroot offers a pleasant variation in the series, I suspect readers, like China, would like to get back to her herb shop in Texas.	2002-11-06

Deborah Knott, youngest of twelve children and only daughter of ex-bootlegger Kezzie Knott, is a circuit judge in rural North Carolina.  On the bench, she's compassionate but firm; off the bench, she manages to avoid both marriage and speeding tickets -- barely.<br /> A carnival comes to Deborah's own Colleton, County, North Carolina. Deborah and assorted cousins are enjoying the rides when the carnival owner's elder son is found murdered.<br />Deborah's personal and professional lives are intertwined as she helps her old friend, Sheriff Dwight Bryant, investigate the crime.  The mystery is not a whodunit and many readers won't care when the villain is revealed. The strength of the book comes from strong writing, three-dimensional characters and the North Carolina rural setting.<br />As usual, Deborah's young cousins teeter on the edge of the law while her assorted brothers and sisters-in-law carry on family traditions of southern hospitality.  And as Deborah faces re-election, she regrets her checkered history of relationships and considers a surprising proposition from someone close to her.<br />Slow Dollar evokes an unsentimental but loving picture of the Old South. Like the author, Deborah grew up in North Carolina, lived &quot;up north&quot; and returned home. She respects the heritage of the south while defying its traditions in her own life.<br /><br />And the series is as warm and delicious as a southern baked biscuit with melted butter -- after you've consumed one, you're eager for the next.  The Knott family might try Deborah's patience but they manage to be warm and supportive without degenerating into sentimental syrup.  If you're new to the series, read a few of the earlier volumes first -- you'll enjoy this one even more.	2002-11-01

Women's basketball books occupy a special niche in sportswriting.<br />Writing about a male players, an author might ask, \\"How did they make it into the big time?\\"<br />Writing about women, authors are forced to ask, \\"How did they get here at all?\\" This question adds a new dimension to the stories of women athletes.  Players as young as today's collegians have had to overcome stereotypes. Many played on boys' teams -- or tried to.<br />Gallaudet women have to overcome a double stereotype -- being not only female, but also deaf. There was a time when opposing teams would openly ridicule deaf basketball players. One player was devastated as a high school student when a coach from a Christian academy openly laughed at her speech.  She made the team but never forgot the experience.<br />However, the players want to be taken seriously as athletes. They do not want or need pity or condescension. To Coffey's credit, the book focuses on basketball, not deafness. We learn how players and teams compensate for a silent world. They can hear someone dribbling behind them.  Referees are briefed: players can't hear the whistle so they may not stop playing immediately.  And players on \\"hearing\\" teams need ASL translators who understand basketball terms.<br />Yet ultimately the story is about the game: coming together as a team and working to win.  Like any sports book, there are stories of triumphs as well as tears. We come to care about the players as they, like all college athletes, balance basketball and books.<br />Perhaps the most difficult story takes place after the book was written. Ronda Jo Miller, an All-American center, cannot reach her goal of playing on a WNBA team. In stories posted on the internet, we can learn that she earned admiration of players and coaches during the tryout camp. She eventually played professionally in Denmark, with a \\"hearing\\" team, and has played in Kansas City with an expansion league, the WNBL.<br />What happens to the other athletes? Playing on a winning team can change lives and I found myself hoping they will continue to feel like winners, long after the season has ended.ng on a winning team can change lives and I found myself hoping they will continue to feel like winners, long after the season has ended.	2002-11-01

The heroine is especially well-done: a pushing sixty, energetic, too quick to say \\"yes\\" except to cover up a murder.<br />The book has all the ingredients: smooth writing, absence of trite phrases, deft plot.  Maid for Murder doesn't have the sharp wit of Sharyn McCrumb's McPherson series or the self-conscious humor of M.C. Beaton.  But it's a faster, smoother read than most others of the genre.

I will put it on my website as a resource for midlife women. However, most of my female clients will not find themselves in this book.<br />Marston writes to women who are secure financially but not emotionally -- the ideal target market for a therapist. Yet many midlife women find themselves facing career dilemmas. They may be laid off or simply find their work unrewarding. They may be financially stressed, with college-bound children and divorce-bound husbands. Some are widowed, tragically, or faced with aging parents who demand time and money. Relatives crawl out of the woodwork, hoping for handouts.<br />Marston does describe one woman feels helpless when losing her job -- but a few pages later she's happily set up in a new business and already has her first large order! Stories like these can create unrealistic expectations. I talk to women who get laid off after twenty-plus years, blow through their severance, and start a business from necessity, not self-fulfillment. The corporate world is not kind to midlife women. And while a few do find orders flooding in, most struggle with marketing dilemmas. After living comfortably with a husband or corporate security blanket, many women are completely unprepared to take the big step to business ownership.<br />So, while I appreciated the insights of this book, I found myself thinking, \\"Who has time to do all this self-reflection?\\"  And the section on beauty misses a key point. We can be as self-accepting as we please...<br />I also felt the book painted a rosy picture of friendships (not everyone has reached middle age with close \\"gal pals\\"). I find that many midlife women turn to family -- parents, siblings, grown children -- and have less time or interest in friendship. Others find they want to distance themselves from family but get calls for everything from money to signatures on cremation permission. I'd like to see more stories of conflict and resolution.<br />Don't get me wrong: I think the book has valuable insights for many women. It's well-written and the stories, despite their magical qualities, entertain. The chapters on sex and relationships seemed right on.

I watch the Sopranos on videotape -- gulping down three episodes at a time -- and I gone back to Season 1 with the help of this book. Gabbard picks up nuances that eluded me on first viewing.<br />Most interesting is Gabbard's portrayal of the therapist, Jennifer Melfi. Not surprisingly, he is pro-therapy. While acknowledging Jennifer's mistakes -- especially her problems with boundaries -- Gabbard insists that Melfi does, after all, recover from those mistakes. And I'm glad he, too, found some of Jennifer's scenes &quot;improbable,&quot; such as her visit to her own therapist with her ex-husband and son. He shed some light on the mystery of Carmela's therapist, the man referred by Dr. Melfi who told Carmela to take the kids and leave. Apparently this therapeutic style is based on input from a real therapist who informally consults with the show.<br />I'm a little puzzled by Gabbard's references to A.J., Anthony Junior, who appears to be in middle school. On the one hand, Gabbard seems a little too forgiving of the psychologist in A.J.'s school, a man who has trouble communicating with laypeople. Telling the parents that A.J. has &quot;five out of nine&quot; symptoms of ADD doesn't help anyone.  And I think Gabbard misinterprets a scene where big sister Meadow, from her infinite wisdom as a college student, helps A.J. interpret Frost's famous poem, Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.  Gabbard says the scene highlights the difference in their academic levels, but I've met few straight teenaged boys who were moved by poetry. If they understand symbolism, they're not willing to admit it.<br />  Gabbard also picks up the verbal cruelty Tony inflicts on his young son: &quot;If this is my male heir -- you want me to have a vasectomy?&quot; Yet he ignores the father-and-son moments between Tony and A.J., such as the night they were squirting whipped cream directly from jar into mouth.  And the family does get together for dinner just about every night -- more than a lot of households do.<br /> Just the fact that I, like many readers, will be stimulated to argue and question Gabbard's book shows its strength: Gabbard's analysis is tough and thought-provoking. There was perhaps too much rehash of the Sopranos episodes (with some errors noted by other reviewers) and too little reflection on why television characters have so much influence.<br />For instance, men have been showing up in therapists' offices in larger numbers since Tony Soprano first met with Dr. Melfi. Do they identify with Tony -- or do they hope to find a gorgeous, brilliant female therapist who wears short skirts as she crosses her legs?  And is there a message for female clients here?

This first mystery, by a talented young writer, creates a chilling atmosphere in the Santa Fe area.  Her pacing is flawless: each chapter kept me turning to the next.  And we care about the heroine, even though I, for one, couldn't understand her.<br />Resting between best-sellers in her Santa Fe home, Lydia Strong  reads about three people who have mysteriously disappeared. The only connection seems to be their absence of ties to others.  Lydia becomes fascinated by these disappearances, just as she has been fascinated by a nearby church that she passes as she runs every day. Lydia's mother was extremely religious and the church seems to be calling Lydia.  In particular, Lydia dreams about the blind man who plays a guitar there.<br />Lydia asks her friend Jeffrey Mark, an ex-FBI man turned private detective, to come to New Mexico and work on the case with her. Their relationship is complex and puzzling. For years they have wanted to be together. Lydia represses her desires, we are supposed to believe, by picking up one-night stands in a bar.<br />Together they put clues together and, not surprisingly, the killer turns out to have connections to the little church. The killer is detected by tracking down a vehicle identification number (that's not giving away the plot -- as soon as they realize they've got a VIN, they're home free), not by clever deduction of motive. If you're looking for a whodunit with clues and a satisfying ending, this isn't the book for you.<br /> I expect the lead character, Lydia Strong, to grow over time, as Sharon McCone has done. Lydia is complex and not always plausible.  Failing to recover from her mother's death, she goes through what Jeff calls a series of \\"psychiatric hit and run\\" encounters with therapists. She's supposed to be sensitive to her environment -- not quite psychic, just preternaturally aware -- but we don't see her use these gifts often.<br />  Lydia  takes herself very seriously (her mother, she says, was also \\"a serious woman,\\" but she doesn't see the irony). There is no humorous relief;<br />Lydia has a dark mind and this is a dark book.

This message is especially timely after the events of 9/11.<br />  Embracing Fear deserves attention not only for the main message, but also for the little gems that appear on almost every page. As a reader and writer in the self-help genre, I was impressed by Rutledge's originality. You won't find the usual \\"positive outlook\\" bromides here; in fact, we are warned to be leery of the New Age manifestation manifestos.<br /> As a therapist, says Rutledge, \\"I sometimes think of myself as an energy-efficiency consultant.\\" <br /> \\"Never trust someone who presents himself or herself as the ultimate expert on the human condition.\\"<br /> People who want to know their \\"life purpose\\" seem to imply there are \\"answers in the back of the book.\\"   <br /> Embracing Fear  will be a valuable resource for the thousands of people who face major career and life changes, which are often accompanied by fear. It will also be welcomed by those who are ready for self-help delivered heavy on the realism and easy on the hype.  	2002-09-09

Finally, a book I can recommend whole-heartedly to my clients!<br />If you're in the job market, or planning to be, consider this book as a small but necessary investment for success.<br />Many books are geared to lower-level, introductory jobs. Kaplan has examples from lawyers, doctors and more.<br />Kaplan manages to be upbeat and readable without raising unrealistic expectations. Functional resume? Great idea but most employers won't like it. Everyone should review the results-oriented examples in Chapter 1.<br />Kaplan offers tips for informational interviews, including sample letters to request meetings with strangers. If you're not familiar with the concept, start reading now!<br />And she's got tips I've never seen anywhere else:<br />How to answer an advertisement for employment<br />How to open a letter when you don't know the gender of the recipient (&quot;Kelly&quot; or &quot;Leslie&quot;) -- and what to do if you<br />don't have the name.<br />How to salvage a shaky interview...<br />and a whole lot more.<br />This book will be of most help to experienced professionals and managers who are changing jobs but<br />not making major career shifts. You'll have to be more<br />creative if you're changing careers altogether -- and in<br />those cases, you really need to rely on your network.<br />If you know a mid-career job searcher, this book would make an<br />excellent recommendation or gift. Newbies out of school would do well to follow the examples, but they may need some help to translate experience to fit the models.<br />Go for it!	2002-08-26

Generally I am partial to novels about women and women's friendship and I love books written as letters and correspondence. I especially like authors who write notes to readers and invite visits to their websites.<br />But this book disappointed me. Lesley, from a poor family, meets Jillian, from the other side of the tracks. They become fast friends. Jillian's family donates money to help Lesley and her younger sister stay in the Catholic private academy. They remain inseparable until Lesley gets pregnant in her senior year of high school. Although their paths diverge, they women stay in touch by letters and phone and, eventually, e-mail.<br />Lesley's story reminded me loosely of Riding in Cars with Boys, except the heroine of Riding in Cars was a lot smarter and caught on faster: she knew she had married a bum who would never be there for her, a drinker who was in and out of jail. Somehow Lesley manages to stay with Buck, her husband, and keep having children.  Not what we'd expect of a scholarship student!<br />Meanwhile Jillian's true love is killed in the war but Jillian herself goes to Barnard College, becomes a New Yorker, and decides to become a lawyer after her involvement in an antiwar protest.<br />In the end, it is Lesley who helps her old friend tbrough a difficult life-threatening problem.<br />The lead characters are stereotyped cardboard. I am not sure why the author gave both lead characters names associated with trendy, upscale WASPs: it was hard to keep them apart sometimes.<br />To the end, neither woman escaped her heritage.  Lesley remained faithful to her goal of nursing, ending up working faithfully for a physician. Jillian, after attending a prestigious, expensive women's college, became a lawyer and then a judge. Lesley remained close to home, in her small town in Washington state. Jillian became a real New Yorker.<br />If you want a light tear-jerker, this book does have some moving moments and we are taken through a fast retrospective of the twentieth century.

Hightower writes about yet another dysfunctional southern family. The heroine, Georgie, has escaped to her own antique shop; her sister is charmingly in her own world; her brother is gay. Georgie had a baby at the age of sixteen, a son who is now sixteen himself, and who has disappeared for the last two years.<br />The family comes together after their mother dies under mysterious circumstances and Georgie suspects their father was responsible. Their father, while not typically abusive, could be cruel; his life has been directed by a stint in the Marine Corps, where he met men who would influence the rest of his life.<br />Although the story is a suspenseful page-turner, we don't learn the story until the last few pages, when everything comes together. We get a sense of \\"Yes, now it all makes sense.\\"<br />Yet in the end three people are dead and two were innocent of anything except getting caught up too deeply in the family struggles. One was implicated, falsely, in a murder.<br />Among novels of dysfunctional families and psychological suspense, High Water ranks as one of the best. Unfortunately, I had just picked up Sacrament of Lies by Elizabeth Dewberry, which has a similar theme -- heroine wondering if father killed mother -- but is not as plausible, deep or well-written.  After reading the two in sequence, I began to wonder if this isn't some new sub-genre, just as child and wife abuse was a theme a few years ago.<br />If you have to choose, read this one.	2002-08-18

Okay, I usually do NOT like books about television and movie stars. I DO like the Sopranos. And, to my surprise, I really liked Wise Girl.<br />Sigler (or her editor) created an unpretentious book about a young woman who was surprised to find herself a star. I liked the straightforward, honest way she describes her experiences. She walked on the set to find another girl onstage. Oh no, she thinks; did I lose the part? It's up to her costar, Robert Iler, to say, \\"Don't you know anything?\\"<br /> The stars of the show -- \\"Tony\\" and \\"Carmela\\" -- assure her, \\"We're not yelling at you -- we're yelling at Meadow.\\" And they remind her, \\"You can take a break anytime.\\" Wisely, she appreciates their solicitude. And she doesn't take for granted the benefits of stardom -- first class travel, awards, meeting other stars as near-equals.<br /> My favorite story, though, takes place off stage. Overnighting at a Miami hotel, Sigler and her mom overhear cries that sound like a woman being attacked. Sigler rushes to save the woman and the bad guy eventually gets caught. The young woman -- a teenaged runaway -- comes by to say thank you. She had never heard of the author or the show, as she had no television set. That was a truly moving moment.<br /> In some ways, Sigler reminds me of Olympic gold medalist Sarah Hughes: both unspoiled young women from Long Island, reaching higher than they ever expected.<br /> There are also parallels between Jamie-Lynn Sigler and Michael J. Fox, and I recommend reading Lucky Man before or after you read Wise Girl.  Both cared more about acting than school; both took risks as young people; both came from down-to-earth, supportive families; both lucked into starring roles early in their career; both reluctantly shared stories about medical problems. Sigler doesn't steal the Sopranos the way Michael J. Fox stole Family Ties, and she doesn't have a movie on the scale of Back to the Future.  But she's likely to have a solid career if she plays her cards right and doesn't fall into typical traps of drinking, drugs or shoplifting.<br /> Sigler says she wants to send a message about eating disorders. She herself was motivated to get \\"cured\\" after she almost lost her Sopranos role following severe weight loss. I have no idea how young women with eating disorders will relate to this book or be inspired by Sigler's example.  I love my Haagen-Dasz ice cream far too much to ever have an eating disorder.  However, I would give this book to any young female Sopranos fan who might be struggling with these battles.<br /> In one story, Sigler says she got to meet Michael J.

We meet her as she begins to wonder if her father killed her mentally-disturbed mother -- or if her speculations are merely the product of her own disturbed mind.<br />It is a gripping idea. Imagine that you're related to a powerful governor: to whom do you relate your suspicions? The troopers are sworn to guard the governor, not question his behavior. And as another politician notes, this governor is good for the state. His rival would actually do harm.<br />Following a divorce, Grayson now lives with a man who works for her father. She herself does some unspecified work for the family. She's truly surrounded.<br />As other reviewers note, the ending is disappointing: it depends on coincidence and not on the heroine's own cleverness. Yet even earlier, I began to wonder: How realistic is this situation? And I began to get impatient with Grayson. Why doesn't this smart, well-educated, reasonably well-off woman get herself some good professional psychotherapy?  She doesn't have to go to her mother's psychiatrist: Tulane boasts a first-rate medical school. Her most pressing problem, of course, is \\"Did father kill mother?\\" But long ago she should have faced a longer-term issue: life without father. She needs to grow up and find her own place in life, make friends with people who don't know her father, and find something to do with herself.<br />The New Orleans background was well-done. It helps if you've read Julie Smith's Skip Landon series.  Skip broke away from the unique social pressures of the city. Grayson needs to do the same.	2002-08-17

Here she seems to be determined to write another book but she doesn't have a really new focus.<br />An early chapter offers a cookbook of typical transitions with suggestions for dealing with each, attributed to a therapist. Relocation is discussed in a single paragraph, including the sentence that &quot;Research shows that after two years people are somewhat settled...&quot; What research? What is &quot;somewhat settled?&quot; In my own book, Making the Big Move,  I say that research (and I cite the research) shows people need at least two years to make friends. I also note the need to start over with new relationships -- a very similar point to the one made here. Adrienne adds the banal (and overgeneralized) comment that &quot;people love to give advice&quot; so ask the neighbors.  Other transitions are dealt with in a similarly shallow fashion.<br />To be sure, there are some real gems to be found later in the book. For example, dieters are urged to &quot;fill the space with something meaningful. &quot; The section on ego vs. intuition is excellent and the argument that &quot;change means giving up something&quot; deserves wide attention.<br />Therefore, it is disconcerting to find Adrienne associating synchronicity with &quot;six degrees of separation,&quot; and an isolated chapter on numerology, with no guidance on using the results. I must admit that, of all occult forms, I find numerology least helpful because it seems deterministic rather than intuitive.<br />Still, this book does not live up to the promise of Adrienne's earlier work. We find lists and summaries where we need thought and inspiration. Overall, it's like the girl in the nursery rhyme: when it's good, it's very very good. And some sections are really really bad.  And the good parts can be found elsewhere.  I wish Adrienne had come up with an exciting premise that would have informed and enlivened all the chapters.<br />In this book, life purpose is defined as a form of goal-directed energy.

As I work with career changers, I have become convinced that most of us have not learned this skill, and most of us could benefit from a careful reading of this book. <br />Hastie and Dawes present results of scientific psychological research, using language that is easy for the ordinary person to understand. Their examples come from everyday life and news stories: Chernobyl, the &quot;hot hand&quot; theory of basketball, mammography.  <br />I would also recommend this book to any students of psychology, including those entering graduate school in social psychology, marketing or management. Hastie and Dawes demonstrate that academic studies needn't be dry, but in fact yield fascinating conclusions that are widely relevant. At the same time, they show the way researchers think and introduce the notion of probability in a way that makes readers want to learn more.	2002-08-12

I wish some publisher would reissue this title, as it's much better than I would expect from its out of print status. Ms. Peterson should have searched more widely for an agent and a publisher -- and an editor.<br />The book is extremely well-written (perhaps due to the editing of Ed Eakin, who undoubtedly is related to the publisher). What probably kept it off a lot of shelves is the introduction, where Ms. Peterson emphasizes that she was \\"harassed\\" and \\"betrayed.\\" It's all too easy for a reader to say, \\"Oh no, not another one of those. Maybe she was a loser.\\"<br />In fact, Ms. Peterson was a sterling cadet. By her own account, she had a challenging but not particularly stressful sojourn at West Point. She was a natural, coming from a background that included such diverse activities as judo and cheerleading. Her room-cleaning abilities were legendary.<br />Throughout her four years, she attracted great-looking dates, sympathetic leaders and a wonderful sponsor. She shows real humor, describing how she coped with a spazzy roommate during \\"Beast,\\" the summer of basic training.  Through her report of this episode, we learn about West Point's emphasis on \\"cooperate and graduate.\\"<br />More seriously, we get a cadet's eye view of the Honor system when Ms. Peterson describes her service on Honor Board.<br /><br />Throughout the four years, Ms. Peterson kept her humor and her standards. She accepted leadership roles easily and apparently managed to get good grades. In turn, she admits (without getting maudlin), West Point gave her some of the most wonderful memories of her life.<br />Her only setback -- the \\"betrayal\\" she mentions in the intro -- came when a female Tac officer failed to respond responsibly to jealous complaints by males who were competing with Donna for a coveted command slot senior year.  A female roommate  inadvertently contributed to the problem.<br />The only other flaw is the absence of a section describing what happened afterward. We get a very abbreviated description -- a sentence of two about a few characters. What happened to Mary Ann, the first-year roommate? What did the author do as a commander of helicopter companies?  How did West Point really affect her later life? Perhaps she needs to write another book.<br />If this book becomes available, I'd buy it. Some publisher out there is missing a bet.

Madam Millie is not about bordellos or lurid sex detail. It's about a tough, wise, loveable woman. There are a few funny incidents -- as when a cat attacks a delicate portion of a bishop's anatomy -- but today they seem rather tame.<br /> Millie's long life was never ordinary. Orphaned at a young age, she was saved from juvenile justice by Harry S. Truman, then a Kansas City judge. When her sister Florence was diagnosed with tuberculosis, Millie accompanied her to Deming, New Mexico, where she worked as a Harvey Girl at the train station.<br />Millie entered her new profession to pay her sister's medical bills. And the rest is, literally, history.<br /> Readers will appreciate Madam Millie on two levels: as the biography of a legend and as a social history of women, work and early life in the southwest. Millie entered the business to pay medical bills for her sister. In one night, she would earn more -- and have a pleasanter life -- than she would in the other occupations open to women at the time.<br /> Millie was first and foremost a businesswoman. She built her success not on her looks but on her charisma, executive skills and ability to read people. It was no accident that her houses attracted high-powered clients. She was their equal.<br /> Millie managed bordellos but she also bought and sold real estate.  If she had been born forty years later, she would be a player in business or politics -- a very different but equally challenging game.<br /> Readers can debate the morality -- and inevitabilty -- of Millie's \\"business.\\" Millie herself believed there would always be a need, whether legally met or not. As Millie acknowledged, in the end what she had to sell soon became available for free, thanks to birth control and a changing society.<br /> Millie ran clean houses, with no drugs and no disease, and her contributions to the community must have set a record. There were no rescue agencies back then. She *was* the Red Cross.  Her last houses on Hudson Street -- site of the current Silver City post offices -- closed in 1968.<br /> Madam Millie is fast-paced and easy to read. We get a sense of her wit and style, though not a great deal of her thought processes. Then again, Madam Millie does not come across as an introspective gal. She's all action. The pictures help us see history: the \\"girls\\" come across as more humorous than provocative.<br /> Give this book to your favorite Silver City newcomer.

When students complained about their MBA programs, I would urge them to read this book so they'd realize Harvard isn't perfect either.<br />Reid takes you through the day to day life of a first-year MBA student. In a microcosm like HBS, little things make the difference: \\"air time\\" in class, getting into the right study group, and more.<br /><br />Reid also offers some perspective that may be missed by those unfamiliar with b-schools. Clients often ask career coaches (like me) about whether getting an MBA is a wise decision. Reid shows clearly that some people and some career destinations benefit more than others. He himself can maximize the degree's value: aged 26 when he entered (he turned 27 his first year), experience with a top consulting firm, personable and friendly.<br />Read between the lines if you can. MBAs are social. They network. Sure they have to crack the books but success ultimately depends on interpersonal skills -- fitting into section parties, ski weekends and Caribbean getaways.  These folks are definitely bright and beautiful.<br />And don't miss his irritation with Harvard: outrageous residence costs, outdated materials in certain courses, uneven distribution of tenured \\"name\\" professors across sections, and more.<br />Yet in the end, Reid admits, the big \\"H\\" counts for a lot in the business world.<br />I wish we could learn what happened to him and his Harvard friends.

From a scruffy investigator for a legal co-op, renting a room and dating a string of interesting but unsuitable men, she has created a profitable business, discovered her birth family and built a relationship with a man as improbably strong as herself.<br />Here a prominent attorney asks her to investigate facts leading up to the suicide of his godson, the employee of a fashionable magazine. Sharon, recovering from her brother Joey's recent suicide, finds a situation that is tense, to put it mildly: an egotistical boss who spies on employees, the dead man's old girlfriend from high school, and a group of high-strung people who fear loss of their jobs.<br />Marcia Muller's writing and character development make this novel succeed, even when the plot is uncharacteristically contorted. The ending was strangely unsatisfying and there were a couple of loose ends. The villain's character and motivation are unclear and, apparently, uninteresting.  A parallel with Joey's suicide is introduced but not developed. We really don't know enough about Joey and his situation to get involved.<br />Still, I would not miss any of Muller's books: this one is still a cut above most of what's out there. And her last, Listen to the Silence, would be a tough act for anyone to follow.<br />Sharon McCone remains one of the best-developed, contradictory yet plausible heroines in mystery fiction. We're seeing more of Muller's deft humor, especially the references to cats owned by nearly all the continuing characters.<br />But there's one detail in Dead Midnight that bothers me. Sharon McCone just hired a new employee, one Julia Rafael, a woman with a hard luck story that Sharon can't resist. But, Sharon wonders, is that story just a little too pat? I thought we'd uncover Julia's real story here; I even wondered if she would be unmasked as an undercover operative for another agency. She's learning awfully fast!<br />In a previous book, Sharon got lots of grief from a job candidate she interviewed. She is, after all, one of the top PI's in the country and she shares resources with the formidable RKI Associates. Wouldn't she check every detail of a new employee's story?  And if she suspects Julia might be a bit of a con artist, wouldn't she dig deeper?  At the very least, hasn't she learned from experience?rief from a job candidate she interviewed.

Every professor -- especially every woman who considers an academic career -- should read this book and Gail Griffin's second, Season of the Witch.<br />Griffin (or Gail, as she'd probably prefer) writes an unsparing, honest account of her life as a college professor at a small &quot;teaching institution.&quot;  What's rare -- and what probably kept this book out of the mainstream -- is her ability to integrate literature with life. She must be an incredible teacher. Her brief descriptions of classroom discussion motivated me to search out some books I would have missed otherwise, notably The Color Purple.<br />As a career coach/consultant, I noted that Gail Griffin reveals her own career sensitivity. She instinctively chose a college where her unique talents would flourish. As she writes, she felt at home right away, although she fought the feeling. Like most new assistant professors, fresh from a prestigious graduate school, she had been taught to value scholarship -- articles in high-powered journals -- over teaching.  In the language of career counseling, she created a career that expressed her own value system and seems to serve her life purpose.<br />As an ex-professor, I can appreciate Griffin's challenge at tiny Kalamazoo College.

Suzanne Chazin, who is married to a New York City firefighter, allows us to get behind the scenes of a world few of us will ever see.<br />The strength of Flashover comes from a strong, plausible plot, where both crime and solution are grounded in the author's thorough grasp of pyrotechnics. Fire Marshal Georgia Skeehan investigates two mysterious fires that show signs of \\"flashover,\\" combustion of a room and its contents by simultaneous ignition.<br />Skeehan believes both deaths are connected to denial of disability coverage to fighters who fought a warehouse blaze nearly thirty years ago.  She meets resistance and veiled threats when she digs through past reports. Adding to her frustration, her best friend disappears and her boyfriend arrested on suspicion.<br />The last chapters are worth the price of admission. Chazin takes us through an adventure scene that keeps the pages turning, building a unique venue for the final conflict. The heroine seems completely cornered but uses her own skills to rescue herself.  The solution plays fair: we are surprised but not deceived when we learn the identity of the villain<br />For many readers, the strong plot and setting will outweigh the awkward writing and incomplete characters. Most annoying are the abundant clich&eacute;s  (\\"...a ghost of its former self...\\" \\"stopped ... in her tracks...\\") and far-fetched, distracting analogies.<br />How does it feel to have blood \\"crystallizing\\" in your veins? Or your heart as tight as a twisted dishrag? Or your stomach like a box with marbles rattling around?  Or see a sky the color of a faded t-shirt?  What does it mean for someone to have \\"a firefighter's sincerity?\\"<br />The author needs to step back and let her characters reveal themselves and their thoughts. Is it Georgia who sees Federalist columns and Beaux Arts touches on Grand Central or is the author intruding? Was Georgia an art history major in college?<br />Ironically, the brief chapters about \\"Hood\\" and \\"Bear\\" are written with greater sensitivity.  Some supporting characters -- the boyfriend and best friend -- have more recognizable, identifying features and dialogue than the main character.<br />Still, the plot and setting are strong enough to outweigh the book's flaws.  I'd pack Flashover for flight or beach reading.  With meatier character development and a tighter writing style, the series should evolve from \\"very good\\" to \\"truly great.\\"e author intruding?

As an adult, I collected early editions.<br />The series is politically incorrect and none of the issues would be relevant today.<br />But there's a real fascination about reading these books as an adult.

Some are New Age-y: A woman closing her business is surprised when someone says, &quot;I feel that I should speak to you...&quot;  Others are more straightforward and down-to-earth.<br />I couldn't relate to all -- even most -- of the stories here. If you haven't had the experience, the story is meaningless. Several involve getting tough about relationships.<br />Two essays were especially powerful: &quot;She saw a monster in her bedroom&quot; is about a woman who realizes she must leave to escape a &quot;monster&quot; husband -- at age seventy-one.  Beattie concludes, &quot;It's hard to be a newcomer at anything.&quot;<br />&quot;He had to backtrack&quot; is the story of a young delinquent who turns his life around after a gifted counselor roots out long-buried feelings.<br />I see each episode as a turning point rather than a choice: each time the protagonist hit bottom, his or her life changed. It's not always about choices: the delinquent doesn't face a crossroads.<br />I'd probably recommend this book to clients whose lives felt out of control, who wanted role models and examples of taking charge, or who wanted to understand the concept of change.<br />One negative: Each chapter ends with a small lesson  that could be omitted. It's overkill. The book's power comes from the stories and the way Beattie tells them. The lessons themselves are not particularly new or original. Leave them out.	2002-07-27

A PhD in English, she turns to the railroad for a career. A tough strong woman, she openly shares her battles with alcohol, an unsupportive mother and an up-and-down love life.  Her prose does credit to her scholarly degree. She evokes the life clearly, even brutally. You can almost smell the fresh tomatoes at the depot in California.<br />Niemann tells the story of a bygone era, when railroading was a craft and &quot;rails&quot; lived hard.  It's the story of anyone whose career gets in their blood and becomes a life. As a career coach, I recommend this book for symbolism and lyricism but also for the<br />notion of choices made and roads taken. You'll remember Linda for a long time.	2002-07-17

Walker's book goes a long way toward meeting the increasing need for books about mid-career, midlife transitions.<br />I would definitely recommend this book to my career coaching clients because it has insights available nowhere else.<br />Walker writes in straightforward &quot;advice&quot; style with no attempt to create the jazzy style common among self-help books. It's easy to read, although I winced at the clich&eacute;s (&quot;It's not over till it's over&quot;).  You're definitely out of the &quot;dream-it-and-do-it&quot; mode here.<br />The best part of the book comes at the beginning, when Walker describes what it's like to go through a midlife career crisis.  Midlife career change is defined as a change &quot;when age is a factor.&quot;  Walker claims that attitude determines whether age is an advantage or disadvantage, although she later acknowledges that discrimination is a reality that &quot;should not be tolerated.&quot; And I never figured out how attitude can create an &quot;age advantage.&quot;<br />Walker differentiates beginning, middle and endings people, i.e., the stage of a transition where people feel most comfortable.  Her distinction resembles Martha Beck's four stages (Finding Your Own North Star) and my own distinction between jumpers and clingers (see articles on movinglady.com).<br />Walker's discussion of resumes is superb,  especially the emphasis on &quot;accomplishment statements.&quot;  Although she suggests leaving off the &quot;objective,&quot; I encourage clients to run their resumes past someone who is active in their own field. Some firms and fields actually like objectives.<br />I also like Walker's reality checks. Finding a new job, especially if you are changing fields, can take a long time, and you may need to mourn your lost career.<br />For setting up your own business or consulting firm, Walker's guidance is accurate and perceptive.  Her advice about learning a firm's culture seems basic -- until you realize that someone who's been in a job for twenty-plus years is like a fish who stopped seeing the water.<br />That said, I believe Walker underestimates the effect of identity on midlife career transition. She resists the term &quot;overqualified&quot; employee yet urges the midlife applicant to be careful not to intimidate the employer during a hiring interview.<br />My view is different. Being overqualified does create stress among employees and their coworkers and, if you have to worry about intimidating others during the interview, you'll be tippy-toeing around for the remainder of your career.<br />I question the value of a detailed assessment program. I find that people in their forties and fifties tend to be self-aware and that abstract values and interests rarely help them align with real careers.<br />Most people have a secret (or not so secret) dream or idea of what they want to do. When they don't, they're usually blocking themselves and standard exercises won't help.  The self-knowledge exercises here are commonplace, even banal: I hope the author saves more dynamic tasks for her &quot;live&quot; clients.<br />Finally, I find that many people would do better to start a business instead of job-hunting, or as a parallel activity. If you're a high-profile person in your community or you've had a very senior position in a narrow area, you may not be able to find a new job -- certainly not a good one -- unless you're a superb networker who's flexible about relocation.<br />I've been told that a former mayor of my town found himself in need of a job after his wife left him, taking the assets (mostly from her side of the family) with her.  Nobody would hire an ex-mayor. He ended up selling cars.<br />The Age Advantage was written well before 9/11, when employees were in short supply, so some of her suggestions seem dated.  That's inevitable when you write practical guidebooks instead of inspirational self-help.<br />Perhaps the greatest omission is a discussion of resources available for additional help. Today, with so many coaches, counselors and consultants, I think it's important to know what you want and how to where to get it -- and whether you need a coach at all.<br />The major negative -- and the reason I held back the fifth star -- is the misleading title. I kept turning the pages in search of career advantages conferred by age -- and couldn't fine even one.<br />Walker says that attitude determines whether age is an advantage of a roadblock, yet the book seems to be about coping with the negative aspects of age during a job search. Discrimination occurs and that employers have preconceptions, says the author. And, while midlife transitioners have experience, younger jobseekers bring eagerness to move up and possibly more recent and relevant education.<br />You won't find inspiration, spirituality or uplift here. Your heart won't soar. For that, read Martha Beck's Finding Your Own North Star. But you will find solid information and guidance, available nowhere else, to move you to your next career.cussion of resources available for additional help.

Higgins, daughter of suspense master Mary Higgins Clark, serves up another frothy concoction, as delicious and memorable as a puff pastry. Regan Reilly, Clark's heroine, is a Los Angeles-based private investigator. While visiting her mother Nora, a famous novelist (of course), Regan is asked to investigate a murder in a once-grand private club, located along Gramercy Park.<br />The club definitely needs help: its premier tenants are a struggling school for butlers and a woman who serves up parties for singles to mingle.  When Ned dies, club manager Jack mourns not only the loss of a friend, but also the four diamonds Ned has bequeathed to the club -- enough to restore its former glory.  Ned has also bequeathed two enormous sheep, who keep getting in the way of everybody trying to solve the crime.<br />This mystery is not a whodunit, but rather a \\"when-will-the-detective-figure-it-out.\\" We readers know where the stones are hidden. We get a glimpse of each character's story along the way.  Regan doesn't so much detect as stir things up, and the ending is satisfactory as all the strands come together in a satisfying little ball.<br />Fleeced succeeds by not trying to be more than it is: a few hours of pure escape --  the perfect airplane book. Moving along, you don't ask questions like, \\"How can Regan work in New York if she has a California PI license?\\" or, \\"How come the New York cops open their files to Regan just for the asking -- even if her boyfriend is one of their own?\\"  After all, it doesn't really matter. You don't want to know how many calories lurk in that chocolate &eacute;clair either.  Just keep an eye on those sheep.	2002-06-28

Still, Albion bit the bullet. He left a tenured position. In academia, that's like jumping off a bridge: once you've done it, you're never viewed the same way again.<br />In my earlier incarnation as a marketing professor, I knew of Albion's work and reputation.  I admire Albion's ability to keep a toe in the academic water while embarking on a quasi-New Age search for meaning. When I gave up tenure, and eventually left academia, people stopped speaking to me!  I am grateful to Albion for making escapes like mine acceptable. And as a career coach, I sometimes work with clients who want to jump ship.<br />Albion's book is written for the midlife transitioner -- one of the few available.

Many of these tips can be found on the website of Coach University, which raises questions about originality of the ideas.<br />While Cheryl, as a coach, encourages everyone to hire a coach, she endorses CoachU and International Coach Federation.<br />Readers should know that there are other coaching organizations, and many people think others are higher-quality than those she recommends. And while many professional organizations enforce ethical codes and discipline erring members, when I last checked neither CoachU nor ICF did. In fact, both organizations refused to consider de-listing a coach following a complaint.<br />Readers should also realize that some people are skeptical about the notion of &quot;coach training&quot; altogether, as there is no scientific or scholarly rationale behind coaching and most schools admit anyone with a checkbook. As a coach myself, I think we're nothing more than independent consultants. You buy the person, not the training.	2002-06-28

This book would not be one of them.<br />As another reader commented, there's not much new here. Richardson does not offer exciting new ways of looking at the world.<br />A number of Richardson's suggestions, such as extreme self-care and clutter-clearing, are included in Coach University's training program, and possibly in others. It is not clear whether Richardson developed those programs for CoachU or whether she is adapting those ideas for her book.<br />What's missing is a theoretical worldview that would explain WHY these ideas work. Authors like Martha Beck, Carolyn Myss, Julia Cameron and Rick Jarow have well-developed, thoughtful, original insights that frame their books. What we have here is a group of tips -- useful, but not meaty.<br />Each chapter concludes with a list of recommended books; however, some recommendations are not related to the chapter and some seem to miss the point (e.g., the recommendations for &quot;focusing&quot;).<br />I'm disturbed by Richardson's recommendation to get a &quot;well-trained experienced coach,&quot; followed by her listing of Coach University. Like many people, I responded to media hype when I sought a coach for myself. I looked up CoachU's referral lists and managed to find two CoachU graduates who had no idea what they were doing.<br />One self-styled business coach encouraged me to start a business without a plan, recommending a resource who turned out to be his relative.<br />Another, after praising me for weeks, admitted she would never discourage someone from pursuing a goal, even if she realized the client was walking into a wall. She believed her sole response should be, &quot;That's wonderful!&quot;<br />Neither CoachU nor the International Coach Federation has a disciplinary process or a way to remove coaches following a complaint. I'm not aware of academic or other prerequisites for attending a coaching school, other than the ability to produce a credit card. By appearing to endorse these organizations, Richardson endows them with a credibility that readers can misinterpret.<br />There ARE other coaching schools; however, in evaluating schools for myself, I have not identified any coaching school that is based on scientific and/or scholarly principles.

Her heroine, Rachel Alexander, a dog-trainer-turned-PI, comes from a traditional Jewish family that disapproves of both her occupations.  Like Rachel's family, and like Rachel herself, we readers find ourselves asking, \\"How did she get into this?\\"<br /> The Long Good Boy is sixth in the series featuring Rachel and her sidekick Dashiell, a superbly trained pit bull, with guide dog certifications that let him stay close to Rachel wherever she goes. And Rachel needs help when she enters Manhattan's meat-packing district to help three transvestite hookers find out who murdered one of their friends -- and whether one of them might be the next victim.<br />Rachel learns that another murder took place nearby, just the night before \\"Rosalinda\\" was murdered. Coincidence? Not likely. Determined to unearth the connection, Rachel goes undercover in a part-time sales job at Saks, finds creative ways to, um, release the files she needs from the meat company, and takes to the streets for a brief but memorable stroll.<br /> Benjamin always plays fair. Dogs don't talk or solve crimes. Any top-dog trainer could turn Chi-Chi's tiny dachsund, Clint,  into a competent burglar when Dashiell turns out to be the wrong size. Dog lovers will recognize Clint's expression after the first training session:  \\"Thank goodness somebody finally realized I have a brain.\\"<br /> Benjamin's vividly depicts a world most readers would just as soon not know about: \\"tranny\\" hookers trying to earn money for dope, getting into strange cars, negotiating with \\"pimps\\" who are not much into employee relations.  Yet the characters are portrayed three-dimensionally, sympathetically but not sentimentally. And somehow Benjamin manages to maintain the style of a \\"cozy\\" mystery in this totally un-cozy setting -- the sign of an author who is very much on top of her craft.	2002-06-28

They solve cases by creating undercover capers that Scottoline insists are perfectly plausible.  Would three women lawyers dress up as hookers to gain access to a sleazy motel room? Well, it could happen.<br />Courting Trouble reveals the tender side of tough-lawyer-and-boss Bennie Rosato. Off-duty she wears cut-off shorts, builds muscles by rowing a boat, and keeps a traditional single-woman-minimalist refrigerator.  On or off duty, she dispenses wise advice about love and law.<br /> Scottoline also introduces a family theme. Mary's magical Italian family, a staple of the series, contrasts with Anne's distant mother.  Readers can decide if these sections are warm and fuzzy or just plain mushy, and whether a law firm can --or should -- be a family.<br />For some readers, the red herring that occupies most of the book will be transparent and the ending willl seem contrived.  However, I suspect that Scottoline fans read less for plot than for answers to, \\"What are those women doing now?\\" And for transplanted Philadelphians, each volume in the series offers a brief glimpse of home.	2002-06-27

If you're a mystery reader, there's nothing like the joy of discovering an author who can write intelligently and still maintain suspense. Backer's debut novel offers several reasons to rejoice: Sympathetic three-dimensional characters, genuine puzzles that we want to solve and, most of all, a wryly humorous view of contemporary Japan in the heat of an unsparing summer.<br /> Alex Thorn, an American psychologist, visits Shizuoka to learn why his twenty-year old son, Cody, an exchange student at the local Shizuyama Unversity, died suddenly in a motorcycle accident.  Although Cody's body showed evidence of sophisticated medical procedures, there was  no record of a hospital stay and -- more significantly -- no hospital bill. What Alex did have was a receipt for the large sum he had paid Gone With the Wind, a &quot;fantasy funeral&quot; home, to ship Cody's body back to Seattle.<br /> Working at GWTW is Gaby Stanton, a thirty-six-year-old American who has no idea why she lost her English professor position at Shizuyama University.  GWTW has no record of Cody's body and no copy of Alex's bill.<br /> Alex blunders around Japan, feeling hot, awkward and out of place. Gaby interprets not only the language but also the culture, which requires reading between lines and hearing what is not said.<br /> Becker offers a rare combination of mystery, human interest and humor, delivered in smooth, literate writing style. The ending comes as an anticlimax -- I was hoping for a more sinister explanation -- and you won't get scared even if you read this book alone in a dark, creaky house. Still, I never lost interest. I found myself wishing I could spend more time with the lead characters and hoping we do not have to wait long for Backer's next book.	2002-06-05

Her heroine, Rachel Alexander, a dog-trainer-turned-PI, comes from a traditional Jewish family that disapproves of both her occupations.  Like Rachel's family, and like Rachel herself, we readers find ourselves asking, \\"How did she get into this?\\"<BR> The Long Good Boy is sixth in the series featuring Rachel and her sidekick Dashiell, a superbly trained pit bull, with guide dog certifications that let him stay close to Rachel wherever she goes. And Rachel needs help when she enters Manhattan's meat-packing district to help three transvestite hookers find out who murdered one of their friends -- and whether one of them might be the next victim. <BR>Rachel learns that another murder took place nearby, just the night before \\"Rosalinda\\" was murdered. Coincidence? Not likely. Determined to unearth the connection, Rachel goes undercover in a part-time sales job at Saks, finds creative ways to, um, release the files she needs from the meat company, and takes to the streets for a brief but memorable stroll.<BR> Benjamin always plays fair. Dogs don't talk or solve crimes. Any top-dog trainer could turn Chi-Chi's tiny dachsund, Clint,  into a competent burglar when Dashiell turns out to be the wrong size. Dog lovers will recognize Clint's expression after the first training session:  \\"Thank goodness somebody finally realized I have a brain.\\" <BR> Benjamin's vividly depicts a world most readers would just as soon not know about: \\"tranny\\" hookers trying to earn money for dope, getting into strange cars, negotiating with \\"pimps\\" who are not much into employee relations.  Yet the characters are portrayed three-dimensionally, sympathetically but not sentimentally. And somehow Benjamin manages to maintain the style of a \\"cozy\\" mystery in this totally un-cozy setting -- the sign of an author who is very much on top of her craft.	2002-06-05

Is she case of &quot;those who can't do, teach?&quot; I wondered myself, until I listened to audiotapes of this book on a long cross-country drive.  Once I got past the author's accent, which deterred even this ex-New Yorker, I found sparkling gems of wisdom that shone more brightly on a second read-around. The hardcover edition was even better.<br /> Like all Goldberg's nonfiction, this book is a series of short essays and memoirs, which can be read randomly, but I recommend taking the chapters in order.  Goldberg begins by throwing cold water on a dream.  Writing won't bring you a living, a solution to life's problems, a bowl of raspberries. Writing is, after all, just writing.<br /> Natalie herself was not an overnight success.  The author's mother encouraged her to get a teaching credential because &quot;you can write in the summers.&quot; Young Natalie taught elementary school, worked in a restaurant, and briefly ran a catering business. At twenty-six she discovered zen practice, which transformed her life and literally gave shape to her writing.  After thirteen years of &quot;writing practice,&quot; she published her first book, a small-press release that became an unlikely best-seller.<br /> Thunder and Lightning offers wonderful glimpses of Goldberg's famous writing workshops as well as the way she wrote her one novel, Banana Rose.  Anyone who has tried to create can understand the need for a practice, getting past a &quot;block&quot; and taking criticism in stride. You have to find a way to go on and if you do, the work takes on a life of its own.<br />As Goldberg says, in perhaps the most important insight of this book, readers are fascinated by process.  Books about writing often out-sell the products of writing -- novels and poems. And that is why her own books are so successful.<br /><br /> Thunder and Lightning is the real deal. Zen practice gives the author a genuine spiritual foundation, not a cosmetic cover-up. In writing about writing she touches on careers, vocation, family, opening up the self to growth. In the end, Thunder and Lightning is not about writing. It's about life.r a genuine spiritual foundation, not a cosmetic cover-up. In writing about writing she touches on careers, vocation, family, opening up the self to growth. In the end, Thunder and Lightning is not about writing. It's about life.	2002-06-05

During my twenty-year academic career, I met dozens of colleagues who were forced out -- and others who were so unhappy they wished they could leave. It is easy to criticize Snyder as well as his book, but leaving academia is never easy. Reviewers who say he could have sought a job in secondary education, administration or publishing are extremely naive.<br />At its best, an academic career offers security and satisfaction, but you have to accept the golden handcuffs. Once you are tenured, you can't move unless you choose an administrative career -- which may be closed to those without prior admin experience.  Secondary education, training, and publishing are distinctly different careers. After five to ten years in academia, you have to be very creative (or very lucky) to change locations or find a new career. And if you are denied tenure in a tight market, you are forced to start over in a whole new world -- a world for which academia has not prepared you.<br />As a career consultant, I work with people in different stages of academic careers through my movinglady.com website. I had difficulty finding resources when I was an academic; coaches and career counselors were extremely naive. You have to be there!	2002-04-01

US	43879637	R1VF7CWWW5AQE3	0446527939	588067431	Generally Speaking: A Memoir by the First Woman Promoted to Three-Star General in the United States Army	Books	5	6	10	N	N	A great career story	Reviewers who dismiss the book as a &quot;woman's story&quot; are missing the point. Kennedy joined the Army as a WAC and, as a young officer, was denied access to combat branches. She made strategic moves throughout her career, choosing a branch where her gender wouldn't hold her back, knowing when to speak out and when to keep quiet.<br /> I loved the sections about her training: she didn't worry about getting demerits or being yelled at, and she did worry when she never did get her brass and shoes to shine as brightly as those of her classmates.<br /> The mentoring discussion is superb. She offers guidance to men AND women -- but she dismisses a woman who foolishly asks, &quot;How can I be a general like you?&quot;<br /> As General Kennedy's career demonstrates, you need inner wisdom to move through a system like the Army or a giant corporation. You have limited time and you'd better figure out the rules early. That's the lesson of this book, which I would recommend to all my career consulting clients.	2002-01-02
