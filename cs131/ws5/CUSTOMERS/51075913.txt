LaFantasie, in the PREFACE notes \\"In the end, the Union triumph on Little Round Top set the stage for the battle that was to be fought on the following day, July 3, because Federal possession of the hill meant that General Robert E. Lee's options for further attacks against the defensive line of the Army of the Potomac would be by necessity severely limited.\\" Unlike many works on the fight for Little Round Top, the text does not overemphasize the strategy differences between Lee and Longstreet, but rather gives a clear account of one of the bloodiest five hours of combat during the Civil War. <br /> <br />As to the question why Gettysburg; the text notes that as Lee saw things, he had two choices in the late spring of 1863: either retire on Richmond and stand a siege which ultimately he could not win or carry the war into Pennsylvania with a chance for victory. The book notes several critical flaws in the planned attack of July 2nd: fatally flawed Confederate reconnaissance of the Union left leading Lee to assume that no Federals occupied the ground to be attacked; and patchwork planning by Lee with the attendant bickering between Lee and Longstreet. A succinct account is given of the fighting leading up to the battle for Little Round Top.  Union errors were made as well as Confederate mistakes. Most amazing was Union General Daniel Sickles unauthorized move to the Peach Orchard thereby creating a gap in the Union line on Cemetery Ridge. The result could have been disastrous had not Confederate General Longstreet approached the Peach Orchard. The author writes \\"So by pure luck, and through the fortitude of the troops in blue would give their blood to hold back Longstreet's onslaught that afternoon, Sickles could later claim to be the hero of the day, the savior of the Union.\\"  For this Sickles was later awarded the Medal of Honor which many Union Generals condemned as Sickles' action was deemed insubordinate, irresponsible, and murderous in itseffect. The text provides a compact account of the fighting preceding Little Round Top in an area later referred to as \\"The Valley of Death.\\" <br /> <br />LaFantasie states \\"Technical improvements in weapons ....had far surpassed tactics, making this Civil War a modern war, and a particularly bloody and deadly one...\\" At twilight, over a five hour period, numerous assaults were made to dislodge the Federals from the summit of Little Round Top. Union Captain Judson later described the combat  \\"It was a death grapple in which assailant and assailed seemed resolved to win or fall in the struggle. The enemy [Confederates] had everything to gain if they carried the position; everything to lose if they failed.\\" The author gives an excellent account of this deadly combat that finally ended at deep dusk when Colonel Chamberlain and the 20th Maine's bayonet charge forced the Confederates off the hill. The casualties for both sides was staggering; the Confederates suffered 35 percent casualties in the fight while the price paid by the Army of the Potomac for defending Little Round Top was very high. The narrative of Little Round Top concludes with an account of the misery the troops of both armies suffered during the night following the battle. A very short account of the fighting on July 3rd is given, where Lee's assault on the center of Meade's line failed which was followed by Lee's retreat back to Virginia.  <br /> <br />The book gives some interesting companion material on Civil War combat. Letters of condolences usually stated the \\"...soldier had died a good death that is, a death with specific purpose, a death that at once revealed the religious faith, the innate goodness, the inspiring last words, and the brimming patriotism of the fallen.\\" Regarding death the author writes \\"Soldiers became resigned to the fact that God would either protect them or single them out for sacrifice....Soldiers found comfort in maintaining their antebellum ideas of death and their faith ina Christian God.\\" The book concludes with an EPILOGUE that gives brief accounts of a few of the survivors of Little Round Top. Most interesting is that Union General Gouverneur Warren was known as \\"The Savior of Little Round Top\\" until the rise in popularity (from TV, movies, a book) of Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain in the 1990s. <br /> <br />Some readers may take issue with statements in the EPILOGUE about Robert E. Lee. However, overall this is a well researched, well written account of what arguably was the most critical combat of the Civil War battle at Gettysburg. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />	2005-09-23

With the formation of the German Empire, Britain could no longer enjoy her \\"splendid isolation\\" but had to contend with an emerging strong German Army, a growing navy, increasing industrial might and a rapidly expanding population. The principal defense of Britain now rested with the Royal Navy who could not permit the building of a German Navy strong enough to defeat the British Navy. <br /> <br />The author gives a brief account of the political events that transpired in Europe late in the nineteenth century including short biographies of many of the principal politicians. Most interesting is German Chancellor Bismarck and his grand design. With a young, self-confident, ambitious German Empire the policy of Weltmacht, \\"world power\\" was born and overseas expansion became a major German foreign policy. Several years later, the Third Reich's foreign policy appears to have been influenced by Weltmacht. <br /> <br />With the growing power of the German Empire, Britain had to act. Under the strong leadership of First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher the battleship HMS DREADNAUGHT was designed, built and accepted into the royal Navy in December 1906. This battleship made all other battleships obsolete and initiated an armament race between Britain and Germany. The resulting increased annual naval budgets in Britain reduced the funds available for social programs that were a cornerstone of British Liberal Party politics. <br /> <br />The last half of the text is devoted to the growing tensions and politics between Britain and Germany. Britain made several attempts to reach a compromise with Germany on naval construction and a peaceful settlement of the growing tensions on the continent. Britain and France reached an informal agreement whereby France moved her fleet to the Mediterranean Sea protecting British interests in the area and allowing Britain to withdraw the Royal Navy from the Mediterranean to Portsmouth England, with an implied promise to protect French ports on the Channel. This is a most interesting and descriptive section of the text as Germany, Austria, Russia, France and Britain all moved toward war. Due to the power of the military over the German government, war was inevitable; Germany declared war on France and when Germany ignored Britain's ultimatum, Britain entered the war at midnight on August 4, 1914. <br /> <br />The reader may question why the book is titled \\"DREADNAUGHT\\" when the majority of the text is on international politics.  However, the dreadnaught battleship forced the issue of German vs British naval strength and was the impetuous for the resulting arms race. The lengthy text presents no new information, analysis or conclusions. However, it is a well written and worth reading, if only for the brief biographical sketches of the major players during that critical era. <br />	2005-09-15
US	51075913	R21FVCINE6J96J	031610924X	647165725	Great Tales from English History (Book 2): Joan of Arc, the Princes in the Tower, Bloody Mary, Oliver Cromwell, Sir Isaac Newton, and More	Books	5	14	14	N	N	TALES WELL TOLD	The author Robert Lacey, writes \\"Our first historians were storytellers-our best still are.... \\" In GREAT TALES From ENGLISH HISTORY-Book 2 Lacey demonstrates that he is among the best, both as a historian and a storyteller. Book 2 begins in 1387 with short comments on Geoffrey Chaucer and ends in 1687 with a brief account of Isaac Newton and his principles of the universe.  <br /> <br />Religious and political dissent, dominate this period of English history. The text succinctly covers a multitude of interesting English historical characters such as monarchs Richard II, Richard III, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI (the youngest ever King of England), Henry VII, Henry VIII, Bloody Mary, Elizabeth I, William of Orange, etc. plus other important personage such as Oliver Cromwell, Guy Fawkes, Joan of Arc, etc. Also, the Wars of the Roses, the Puritan Civil War and the 1666 London fire are given brief but interesting coverage. The narration of the reign of Elizabeth I is short but well covered. Her reign saw the creation of England's first stock exchange and her attempt at a tolerant middle way came to define a certain strand of Englishness (that still exists). Lacey concludes that \\"Elizabeth I, Queen of Shakespeare, Ralegh, Drake and the Armada, had presided over one of the most glorious flowering of English history and culture.\\" <br /> <br />Many of Lacey's comments are intriguing. He notes \\"Henry V's own patriotism was deeply infused with religion. Dreaming of England and France unified beneath God....\\" Regarding Oliver Cromwell, the author postulates \\"....has a claim to being England's most remarkable man.\\" The text notes that, with the exception of Goeffrey of Lynn's book Promptorium Parvulorum, \\"Medieval books were for grown-ups....\\" No Harry Potter type books for Medieval children. He states Henry V III \\"....was a great one-arguably England's greatest ever king. Take virtue out of the equation, and his accomplishments were formidable.\\" He notes that \\"Many Elizabethanamusements were brutal by our taste\\" observing that \\"There were several gallows in London. Twenty to thirty offenders were hanged every day the courts sat....\\" Adults and their children rushed to view the executions. <br /> <br />Book 2 also briefly narrates other important English events such as the defeat of the Spanish Armada, noting that contrary to myth Sir Francis Drake did not lead the Royal Navy in the defeat of the Armada. Succinctly narrated are Sir Walter Raleigh's trips to the New World. Most fascinating is the account of the English village of Eyam whose residents in 1665, after twenty-eight \\"black plague\\" deaths, choose not to flee the village and risk spreading the plague around the district. \\"This clearly, was to risk their own lives in an act of extraordinary self-sacrifice.\\" More than 260 inhabitants (three-quarters of the village's population) died from the plague. It is impossible to conceive of a similar act in today's society. <br /> <br />This is a very easy/enjoyable book to read. Both English history buffs, and those totally unfamiliar with the topic, will enjoy this work. It is sincerely hoped that Robert Lacey will write a third book on the subject. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-08-24

During the Civil War, due to family obligations, he legally avoided the military draft by obtaining a substitute to take his place for $150. The author gives an interesting account of Cleveland' political career from assistant district attorney in 1863, to sheriff in 1870, to mayor of Buffalo in January 1882,and finally governor of New York in November 1882. \\"Old-time politicians were appalled at \\" Cleveland's being \\"such a stickler for honesty\\" as corruption was rife in both major parties. The public as a whole was full of esteem and wonder as Cleveland followed his motto \\"Good and pure government lies at the foundation of wealth and progress of every community.\\" <br /> <br />Graff writes Cleveland's reputation for integrity made him a national figure. Cleveland became the Democratic candidate for president in 1884. This was the era before candidates addressed nominating conventions nor did they openly campaign. While good political issues needed to be addressed neither party faced these issues. When Cleveland was accused in a paternity situation, he advised the Democratic Party to \\"Tell the truth.\\" Three words that remain to this day the gold standard reply.  <br /> <br />The author gives a concise narration of Cleveland's first term. Cleveland addressed the issues of reform, labor problems, veterans' affairs and the critical issues of currency and the tariff.  While Congress refused to lower tariffs that hurt the working class, Cleveland focused national attention on the tariff problem. Perhaps the most important bill passed during Cleveland's first term was theInterstate Commerce Act of 1887. Cleveland, a bachelor president, in 1886 at the White House married Francis Folsom twenty-seven years his junior. <br /> <br />In 1888 Cleveland was defeated for reelection. The author states that this was the closest election in American history with Cleveland winning the popular vote but losing the electoral vote. Cleveland's loss was characterized by \\"a disjointed campaign and lifeless leadership, including his own.\\" In thirteen pages, the text covers Cleveland after the election. <br /> <br />In 1892, the Democratic Party again nominated Cleveland for president. He was reelected on November 8 with the Democrats winning control of both houses of Congress. The author gives a brief account of Cleveland's second term that opened with the depression of 1893. Consequently the administration was faced with labor unrest and monetary problems as Congress refused to lower the tariff. To his credit, he stabilized the currency and stemmed the outflow of gold. Cleveland was battling elements that were changing the national scene in ways he could not approve... and \\"plainly dictates that right not might should be the rules of.... conduct.\\" In addition, Cleveland was faced with foreign affairs problems between Britain and Venezuela plus the Cuban Civil War. In 1896 the Republican candidate, McKinley, was elected president. <br /> <br />Upon retiring from public office in 1887, Cleveland made himself a part of the Princeton University community. The author observed \\"He was no longer a partisan politician but a beloved national treasure.\\" Cleveland's last public service was to involve himself in reorganizing the Equitable Life Assurance Society. He died of a heart attack on June 24, 1907; his last words reportedly were \\"I have tried hard to do what is right.\\" <br /> <br />This short work is easy to read and well worth the efford.  Grover Cleveland indeed deserves to be known for more that serving two \\"nonconsecutive\\" terms. <br />	2005-08-11
US	51075913	R1HRQ8Z59GNE7Q	0743226712	53542661	1776	Books	5	8	9	N	N	From "Armed Rabble" to "Respected Rebels"	The author, David McCullough, narrates the critical 12 months of 1776 in America's fight for independence. In Chapter 1 McCullough notes that British King George III was not the idiot as often presented in school textbooks. The officers and men of the American army were young compared to the British army: Washington was 42 years-old while his men averaged 5 years younger than the British. American officers were both young and inexperienced. The text clearly shows that Washington was not \\"austere\\" as schoolbooks often describe him. Most important McCullough notes \\"Washington's affect on the troops and young officers was striking. Washington was wealthy, and the army felt ....if he, George Washington, who had so much, was willing to risk `his all,' however, daunting the odds, then who were they to equivocate.\\"    Part I narrates the siege of the British army in 1776; it was surrounded and pinned-down in Boston by George Washington's American army. Ammunition shortages, desertions and lack of reenlistments were decimating the American army, which the British regulars called \\"the rabble in arms.\\" Through the extraordinary efforts of Americans such as Colonel Henry Knox who moved artillery from Fort Ticonderoga to Dorchester Heights just south of Boston where it could bombard Boston, the American army survived. When a storm prevented a British counterattack on Dorchester Heights, British General Howe evacuated Boston by sea on March 17.     Anticipating the British, Washington moved his army to New York. Part II covers this disastrous 1776 period. The \\"ominous truth was that without sea power,\\" which the Americans lacked, \\"New York was indefensible.\\" A British armada anchored off Staten Island, and on August 22 a fully equipped army of 15,000 men landed on Staten Island. McCullough gives a brief but very readable account of the battles for New York where numerous American mistakes were made. In the battle for Brooklyn, annihilation of the American army was prevented onlyby a brilliantly executed overnight retreat. After Brooklyn, the American army suffered a series of defeats, ultimately abandoning New York and crossing into New Jersey. Inadequate leadership by ill-trained, inexperienced officers, and a woefully overworked commander-in-chief were a contributing factor to theses failures.    Part III narrates the retreat across New Jersey with Washington and his army crossing the Delaware into Pennsylvania in December. The author notes that at this point British General \\"Howe made one of the fateful decisions of the war. He was suspending further military action until spring.\\" McCullough further states \\"Congress had fled.... By all reasonable signs, the war was over and the Americans had lost.\\" Howe's bad decision and Washington's aggressiveness allowed the Americans to make a surprise attack on Trenton, New Jersey on December 26. In a forty-five minute battle the Hessian defenders were defeated and 900 prisoners taken, the American's suffering no battle casualties.  George Washington gave full credit for the victory to his troops. The victory at Trenton had a stunning/ positive effect on the morale of the country. Not content to sit idly-by, Washington crossed again into New Jersey and marched toward Princeton. In a ferocious battle outside Princeton on January 3, 1777, General Greene in fifteen minutes defeated the British. McCullough writes \\"Thus ended the Campaign of 1776 with a second astonishing victory.\\"     The text notes that another six and a half years would pass before the Treaty of Paris ended the war in 1783; and concludes stating \\"But in the last analysis it was Washington and the army that won the war for American independence.\\" \\"Above all, Washington never forgot what was at stake and he never gave up.\\"    This is a well-written work and a pleasure to read. The text gives an excellent overview of Washington's army in 1776 as the stage is set for the long struggle for American independence. My only criticism is thelack of maps.  The three historic maps are interesting but of no help in following the story.	2005-07-28

This work helps correct this deficiency.  <br /> <br />In the Preface, the author, William Davis, states \\"And most of all, the conflict was a political and social battle from beginning to end, at first to establish the Confederacy, but then for the next four years to define what sort of democracy that Confederacy was or ought to be.\\" The text gives an interesting account of secession and the struggle to form a Confederate Democracy. Beginning in 1862, some deserters became a problem as they joined local ruffians to loot and defy authority. Also, \\"Confederates went from protesting love and paternal affection for their slaves to finding themselves almost hysterically terrified of them.\\" In many areas law and order vanished as local government often were unable to enforce order as police and civil servants were taken into the army. The author notes \\"....the legal system of the Confederacy is one marked by an inability to protect its citizens from lawlessness.\\" Davis writes \\"As in so many areas, in theory the Confederacy seemed to be working, but in practice its collapse commenced almost from the day of its birth.\\"   <br /> <br />Military campaign demands produced severe food shortages while speculators hoarded food and goods for profit. The government's cotton policy was a miserable failure as a world surplus of  cotton did not force foreign governments to recognize the Confederacy. In limited circumstances the government allowed some cotton to be sold through the lines to Federal forces. In addition, the planters were under pressure to plant corn for food instead of cotton which depended on blockade runners for sale overseas. The question of individual state's sovereignty in the Confederacy is excellently covered in Chapter 11. For \\"....the Confederacy was destined from theoutset to fight an internal contest between the principles it presented to the world and the imperatives of self-preservation.\\" Davis's notes \\"....as a result of turmoil and upheaval, political reforms were accomplished of necessity if not for their own merit alone.\\" Some measurers ran from the oppressive to the socialistic. <br /> <br />The text gives an interesting narrative of the opposition to the Davis government. Some Confederate generals (Joseph Johnston for one) surreptitiously supported the opposition. As defeat became inevitable, several politicians and citizens worked to secure an honorable defeat.  Davis gives an excellent account of Secretary of War's, General John Breckinridge,efforts to secure a honorable peace. In President Davis's mind the Confederacy did not end with Lee's surrender. Breckinridge accompanied Davis and his party as they fled south from Richmond until President Davis was captured in Georgia. There is a good/ brief account of the Confederacy's final hours. For a more detailed account, William Davis's book AN HONORABLE DEFEAT should be consulted. <br /> <br />Those who have limited their Civil War reading to battles and campaigns will view deserters differently. \\"How can a poor man stand it?\\" moaned a North Carolina soldiers who had not had a furlough in three years, on hearing his family's deplorable conditions. However, Davis gives many examples of how some deserters contributed to deplorable conditions on the home front. The book is not an \\"easy read!\\" My main criticism of the book is an index that is limited and not especially helpful. Every serious Civil War student and/or Buff should have this book in their library. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-07-08

The purpose of a raid was not to gain or hold ground, but to confuse, disrupt, destroy, capture or free, and the force withdrew after the mission is accomplished.\\" The text is organized in two main sections: Chapters 1 thru 3, Confederate Raids; Chapters 4 thru 7 Union Raids. These chapters review major Civil War raids and their accomplishments. <br /> <br />The first raid narrated was Confederate Cavalry General Jeb Stuart's June 1862 ride around Union General McClellan. The author states \\"This was the first major raid of the war, and Jeb Stuart's reputation soared.\\" \\"....Stuart's ride around McClellan caused Union leadership to take men needed for the battle line to guard Washington D.C., and the Confederate success lowered morale in the North and raised it in the South.\\" Confederate General Wheeler's October 1963 raid on Union General Rosecrans's wagons was said to have had mixed results; however, Rosecrans lost 500 critically needed wagons which was the largest lost of its kind in the war. Wade Hampton's cattle raid in September 1864 netted 2,468 cattle; and Union General Grants jokingly said \\"I have the best commissary in the army, he not only feeds my army, but that of the enemy also.\\" The text covers ten (10) Confederate raids from June 1862 through November 1864. <br /> <br />Regarding Union cavalry Col. Black observes \\"In the first two years of the war, the Union cavalry was largely ineffective as a result of poor leadership and organization, and given assignments that did not hone cavalry skills.\\" In addition the U.S. Cavalry began with better armament, but here again misjudgments were made.\\" It wasn't until February 1863 when General Hooker recognized cavalry as an excellent tool, and organized Union cavalry into a corps of three cavalry division under Maj. Gen. Stoneman that an effective/capable organization was available.   <br /> <br />The book gives an excellent narrative of the April-May 1863 raid by Col. Grierson in support of General Grant's Vicksburg campaign. Grant wanted to divert Confederate attention from Vicksburg, and keep their forces scattered. Grierson and his raiders \\"created a furor in the Confederate rear that greatly assisted Grant in taking his army across the Mississippi.\\" By March-April 1865, when Stoneman raided Virginia and North Carolina and Wilson raided Selma both Union and Confederate soldiers knew the war was over. The text covers fourteen (14) Union cavalry raids from November 1862 through April 1865. <br /> <br />The text contains brief biographies of the principal characters. Most interesting was that Confederate cavalry generals Joe Wheeler and Thomas Rosser served in the American Army after the war serving in the Spanish-American War. Most interesting, Samuel Carter who graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy was made a Union brigadier general of volunteers in May 1862 and was promoted to major general in 1865. Amazingly, while he was an army general, the navy promoted him to commander. After the war he served in the navy from which he retired in 1881. <br /> <br />The book contains several proof reading errors. For example, on page 47 the book erroneously lists Washington College (later Washington and Lee College) in Staunton later correctly listing it in Lexington; on page 156 the text reads \\"Stuart mad certain\\" instead of \\"made certain\\", etc. In addition, some readers may disagree with Col. Black calling General Joseph Eggleston a \\"superb Confederate strategist.\\" <br /> <br />Finally, the book contains an excellent section titled Soldiers Talk:  Civil War Terms and Expressions. The reader will find this book interesting; it is an informative narration of major Civil War cavalry raids.  <br />	2005-06-01

However, Whilden's brief fifteen minutes of glory came at the Bloody Angle at Spotsylvania Court House where he vividly demonstrated the capacity of an insignificant player \\"to alter the course of history.\\" <br /> <br />Chapter 1 gives a short review of the 1864 strategic conditions in central Virginia which \\"By most estimates, 1864 loomed as the war's decisive year.\\" In March 1864 President Lincoln made Grant commander-in-chief whose aim was the destruction of the Confederate armies, not to capture territory. The author observed \\"Thus the stage set for the Civil War's decisive campaign....The campaign would be a duel to the death between Grant and Lee, the best generals either side could field. The prize was the fate of two nations.\\" Chapter 2 presents a concise account of pre-Civil War Charleston, S.C. stating the source of Charleston's wealth was rice and that the city's affluence \\"rested on the back of slaves.\\" The author gives an interesting review of the area's concern about a slave rebellion and continues \\"As the Carolina Low country's slave population grew so grew the white minority's unease about servile insurrection.\\" <br /> <br />After a unsuccessful brief career as a lawyer, Charles moved to Detroit where his lack of success continued to plague him.He left Detroit in 1855 and accompanied Colonel Grayson to Santa Fe, New Mexico as the colonel's personal secretary. In Santa Fe his mediocre success continued. When the Civil War commenced, Charles began the long trip home to Charleston. The ship he was on heading for the Carolina coast was badly damaged; and his health was compromised; for the rest of his life he suffered from epileptic seizures. In Charleston he tried to enlist a number of times; but due to his epilepsy he was unsuccessful in enlisting. By January 1864, Confederate manpower shortages were critical; and at age 39 Whilden was at last able to enlist as a private in Company I of the 1st Carolina at Orange Court House in February 1864.  <br /> <br />Author Rhea uses Whilden and the 1st Carolina as the narrative vehicle for an interesting account of the battles of The Wilderness and at Spotsylvania. Whilden's unit was \\"destined to the worst of the campaign's carnage.\\" Whilden received his baptism-under-fire on May 5 in the Battle of the Wilderness, had not run and was appointed as flag barrier when the flag barrier was wounded. Rhea observes \\"The post of flag bearer was important, not only for sentimental reasons but for practical ones as well.\\" Charles career as a color barrier was off to a bad start as Union General Hancock troops overran Charles's unit. Only the last minute arrival of Confederate General Longstreet on May 6th saved the day. On the night of May 7-8 Grant's and Lee's armies moved south to the vicinity of Spotsylvania Court House where Lee erected sophisticated earthworks. The text briefly narrates Grant's fruitless efforts over the next three days to break through Lee's battlements. <br /> <br />Lee had erected a salient, nicknamed The Mule Shoe, and Grant had selected it for a massive attack by Union General Hancock on May 12. Union troops soon overran the pickets and the outer earthworks including the high ground, referred to as \\"the angle\\", to the Confederate left. The author gives a chilling account of the gruesome, bloody chaotic fighting as the Confederates fought to regain the angle and survive. Lee ordered General McGowan's brigade into the Mule Shoe. Charles, \\"still wracked by seizures\\" clearly understood the situation and fixing his eyes on the angle, carried the flag never expecting to reach the angle alive. When the flag was shot from its pole, Whilden wrapped the flag around his body. Behind him followed a \\"motley band of rebels.\\" By ten o'clock in the morning Charles led his fellow Southerners to take over the Bloody Angle thus saving the battle for the Confederates. The butchery of May 12 was horrendous with the two armies suffering approximately seventeen thousand causalities. While Lee had won another battle, \\"the war in Virginia settled into a siege that would last ten months....but Grant had won the campaign, destroying the Army of Northern Virginia's offensive capacity.\\" <br /> <br />His epilepsy making him unfit for service Charles returned to Charleston in August 1864 and was discharged after only eight months of duty. On September 25, 1866, during an epileptic seizure he fell facedown in a mud puddle, and drowned. While there are no monuments to Charles Whilden, his heroic action on May 12, 1864 at the Bloody Angle lives on as a tribute to the potential of an insignificant player who altered the course of Civil War history. <br /> <br />Gordon Rhea has done considerable research on the campaigns of 1864, having previously written several books on these campaigns. This is an easy book to read. Civil War buffs who want a brief/limited account of the battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court and a private who won his fifteen minutes of fame in 1864 at the Bloody Angle, will find this book interesting. <br />	2005-04-14

He notes \\"Heroes and herorines are judged to have had their day. The un-teaching of history concentrates on `themes rather than personalities.  But personality-human nature-is surely the essence of history.\\" In forty-four brief essays, Lacey narrates the stories of the greatest English personalities from the 7150 BC Cheddar Man to Wat Tyler and the Peasants' Revolt in 1381 AD.  <br /> <br />Often early history is based on myths because records are lacking and accounts sometimes were written four or five hundred years after the event.  King Arthur is a prime example and while he probably lived there are questions regarding his reign.  In brief accounts, the author discusses several characters of English history. The text's account of Lady Godiva is most interesting.  Godiva was a \\"generous, kind-hearted and, by all accounts, highly respectable.\\" Regarding her famous ride Lacey writes \\"Godiva may have ridden out symbolically naked-that is, stripped of the fine jewelry and sumptuous costume that denoted her status as one of the great of the land.\\" Lacey notes \\"But real nudity is much more fun, and that is how the story has just not endured but developed.\\" Robin Hood (AD 1225) doesn't come out as well in the text. The only record of his existence is that he came before Royal Judges as an outlaw, and it wasn't until 1589 that we read he took from the rich and gave to the poor. Lacey laments \\"But it is surely ironic that the national heart has been so stirred down the centuries by a man who started out a thief.\\" <br /> <br />One of the most intriguing events noted is that in 1010 AD a monk named Elmer built and flew a glider in which he \\"managed a downward glide of some 200 metres before he landed-or, rather, crash-landed.\\" This was over 800 years before glider experiments began in Europe.  The text states \\"Modern aeronautical experts have recreated Elmer's flight....\\" <br /> <br />The book is not limited to debunking myths, but rather tells the story of medieval England, its monarchs, leaders and history. This is an account filled with drama, intrigue, betrayal, and passion. The text includes many familiar personages such as Edward the Confessor, William the Conqueror, Richard the Lionheart, John Lackland and the Magna Carta, etc. In many respects this is a tale of the early efforts at democracy in England from its first brief tragic appearances to Wat Tyler and the Peasants' Revolt in 1381 AD.  Interestingly, while the Magna Carta was the \\"first written document limiting the powers of the king\\", it's enforcement provisions were soon deleted and it benefited only the barons, not the common man. In 1381 AD the peasants revolted protesting a head count tax that climaxed in a confrontation on the meadows of Smithfield.  Confronting the rebel leader,Wat Tyler, King Richard II, agreed to the rebel's demands; but when Wat Tyler appeared ready to stab the king, Wat Tyler was killed by the Mayor of London.  The action of the boy King Richard II prevented further bloodshed.  The king later \\"rescinded every concession he had had granted under the pressure of rebellion - in his value system, promises made under duress did not count.\\" <br /> <br />The book concludes stating \\"The processes of democracy and consultation that we enjoy today saw their origins in the years whose story is told in this book\\" ending with \\"In the Peasants' Revolt we have heard cries for liberty and equality that resound to this day, and we have seen those demands brutally suppressed.\\" <br /> <br />This is a well-written narrative and is an \\"easy read.\\"  Even the reader who has little interest in medieval English history will find this book enjoyable. The author indicated in his preface, that he is working on another volume that \\"will follow the great tales of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales...\\" I lookforward to this next volume. <br />	2005-04-02
US	51075913	RJZR7HCG3EO8P	0312314868	561001789	God's Bestseller: William Tyndale, Thomas More, and the Writing of the English Bible---A Story of Martyrdom and Betrayal	Books	5	35	35	N	N	Faith - Works - Betrayal - Death	The author, Brian Moynahan, notes that William Tyndale's translation of the Bible \\"....fathered what is probably the best known and certainly the most quoted work in the English language.\\"  A 1998 analysis of the King James Bible, found Tyndale's words account for 84 percent of the New Testament and for 75.8 percent of the Old Testament. The text observes that Tyndale believed English \\"corresponded with scripture better than ....Latin ....\\" The text narrates how Tyndale through faith and sheer determination translated the Bible into the English language. <br /> <br />The author provides a most interesting narrative of the sixteenth century printing and publishing industry in Europe and England. The printing/publishing industry in England was small and closely controlled by the Church and government.  However, Lutheran books and tracts were coming into London from Germany and the Low Countries in large number and on a rising scale.  This was a concern to the government and the Catholic Church in England.  Thomas More began a vigorous campaign to squelch religious reform persecuting heretics and condemning them to death by burning at the stake. For his part, Tyndale began an enthusiastic and dangerous public duel in writing with More. <br /> <br />Though a scholar with a Bachelor and Master of Arts degrees from Oxford Tyndale related to average men who \\"shared ideas with him, ....made a natural constituency for reform, and ...were brave.\\"  He adopted the Reformation's efforts to provide common readers with the Scriptures in English and resented the Church's ban on translation of the Bible into English. He planned to translate the Bible, but was unable to find a patron. In addition, he adopted the new Lutheran doctrine of justification by faith alone and facing prosecution as a heretic, he fled England and sailed to Hamburg in April 1524. He stayed on the continent until his execution eleven years later.  During his self-imposed exile in Germany and Amsterdam, he translated and printed his English translations of the New Testament and a major portion of the Old Testament. In 1526 he published a revision to his New Testament translation and another revision in 1534 in which he made an effort to correct errors while \\"His main aim was to strengthen his writing, to clarify meaning and bring it closer to the Greek.\\" The author notes that Tyndale's work was complicated by the fact that \\"No standard spellings existed in English, and it was a common for a word to be spelt differently in a single passage:....\\" A steady flow of Testaments into England was maintained by smugglers so that by 1534 the Tyndale Testament was a great money-maker. <br /> <br />The book gives an excellent account of Tyndale's exile years.  He continued his dangerous public duel in writing with Thomas More.  More's malice that drove him against Tyndale \\"was a phenomenon, insatiable, galloping, morbific.\\"  In a manner that would do justice to a twentieth century spy novel, against Tyndale, More used \\"double agents, political intuition and the intricate manipulation of rulers and senior officials, the sowing of brides, flattery, and inflexible and murderous intent...\\" Unfortunately, as the author notes in day-to-day politics, Tyndale was inept. Throughout Tyndale's exile, Henry VIII's \\"pursuit of the annulment and remarriage to Ann Boleyn-weaves in and out of Tyndale's life....\\" To her credit, Ann Boleyn protected and promoted evangelicals, and favored Tyndale's scriptures and other writings.\\" She was known as a protector of Tyndale's readers. <br /> <br />The text notes that Tyndale's sympathizers could be burnt at the stake, but Tyndale remained safe in Europe.  In 1531, the king ordered that Tyndale be seized and brought to England using private or illegal means.  Amazingly in November 1539 , Tyndale was contacted by a representative of the King's Secretary and offered a safe conduct back to England which he rejected. By 1534 conditions were changing in England and Tyndale might have been safer in London than in Antwerp, but politically naive Tyndale did not detect the change and stayed in Europe.  On 21 May 1535, a paid bounty-hunter, Harry Phillips, coaxed him out of his safe residence and turned him over to local Low Countries authorities.  Amazingly, the authorities in England no longer had any desire to harm Tyndale and two senior officials of Church and State tried hard to secure Tyndale release in Antwerp. At a castle north of Brussels, not in England, he was tried and convicted as a heretic. Tyndale....refused to try to buy his life with his conscience and remained steadfast in his beliefs.\\" He was burnt at the stake on 6 October 1536. In death Tyndale was a success as injunctions were issued in 1536 and 1538 that every church should be provided with a Bible. His life's work triumphed as \\"His ploughboy soon had his English Bible.\\" <br /> <br />Thomas More refused to recognize Henry as the supreme head of the Church, was arrested and executed on 6 July 1535. The author devotes Chapter 22 to a discussion of who was the paymaster who paid Phillips for locating and betraying Tyndale. Several possible paymasters are noted but there is no strong documentation that any were in fact the payee to Philips.  The author notes that there is no solid evidence, but conjectures that Thomas More was the most likely paymaster.  <br /> <br />As Moynahan writes on page 56 \\"The richness of his vocabulary, his verbs in place of nouns and adjectives, his free sentence constructions, his ear for vivid saying-`as bare as Job and as bald as a coot'-and his sense of rhythm profoundly affected the language of the English-speaking peoples -the global language, now-.\\" While there are no memorials or statues to Tyndale, the author notes that the King James Bible \\"....is, as we have seen, overwhelmingly Tyndale's Bible. Almost any passage in the New and most of the Old Testament, can serve as his memorial. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-03-19
US	51075913	RHAPSFJ3W93GJ	0743223098	269804839	The Wild Blue: The Men and Boys Who Flew the B-24s Over Germany 1944-45	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Boys to Men in 35 Missions	Narrating George McGovern's WWII service in B-24s, Stephen Ambrose also tells the story of the B-24 strategic bomber and the men who served as B-24 crews. Included are  succinct accounts of some crew members who flew in other B-24s. These airmen were a cross section of the United States; i.e. good and bad and stupid and bright, each a slice of humanity. <br /> <br />After McGovern signed-up for the Army Air Force (AAF), he waited a year before called to active duty in February 1943. In 1942 the AAF lacked sufficient airfields, airplanes, instructors, and barracks to immediately start training the large number of airmen the war would require. In 1939 the Army Air Corps had only 1,700 aircraft and 1600 officers. By 1944 the AAF had 2.4 million personnel and was almost one third of the total Army strength. The book gives a short account of pilot training.  Like the rest of the Army, air-crews had to go through army basic training before proceeding to flight training. The author noted \\"It was almost universally agreed that the B-24 was the hardest plane to fly.  The AAF knew that and its training program reflected the fact.\\" The B-24 pilot required physically stamina with McGovern stating that his pre-flight Phys-Ed coach \\"made a bigger contribution to saving our lives than any single person.\\"  After B-24 transition training, aircrews were assigned to aircraft.  The book notes \\"It was critical for each crew to develop and maintain a close bond.\\" Most were twenty-two years old or younger.\\"  <br /> <br />In September 1944, McGovern and crew were judged ready.  They were assigned to the Fifteenth Air Force based at Cerignola, Italy.  They didn't fly a B-24 over but took a long ship trip to Italy. Chapter Four contains an informative discussion of bomber strategy. The British went to night bombing, making German cities and their civilian population the target.\\"  The AAF wanted no part of the British policy, adopting strategic daylight bombing in the summer of 1942, but as the author notes \\"they had been rushed into battle prematurely.\\" Rarely were the missions decisive because the Germans could repair damage almost as fast as they were bombed-out.  Strategic bombs results were flat and casualty rates were high so that by mid-1943 the situation was critical for strategic bombing as conducted by the Eighth Air force in England. By late 1943 loss rate started declining as experience was gained. Also in December 1943, the Fifteenth Air Force was formed so that Germany and Austria were being bombed from the South and in the East.  <br /> <br />After Chapter Five's brief discussion of Cerignola, Italy, Chapter Six narrates how McGovern and other new crews learned to fly in combat.  AAF's policy in late 1994 was for the pilot to fly their first five combat missions as co-pilots with a veteran and experienced crew. McGovern's first mission was November 1, 1944. AAF takeoff procedures would drive today's air traffic controllers nuts. McGovern later admitted \\"Every takeoff made in World War II was an adventure.\\" As a co-pilot McGovern learned much noting that flak was almost always dangerous. McGovern's B-24 was never attacked by German fighter aircraft as few remained in service late in the war. After completing his five co-pilot missions, McGovern took command of his own crew as aircraft commander. While missions were flown against a variety of targets, the strategic emphasis was on oil refineries and railroad marshalling yards. The text provides succinct accounts of the missions McGovern and his crew flew.  On one mission, McGovern's aircraft lost the right wheel on takeoff. They flew the mission and McGovern said regarding his return landing \\"....made the best landing I'd ever made in my life.\\" Enroute to Pilsen, Czechoslovakia on a mission, his aircraft lost an engine and lost a second engine to flak over the target. On the return McGovern made an emergency landing on an Adriatic island.   <br /> <br />Chapter Nine is devoted to The Tuskegee Airmen who in P-51s flew cover in 1945 for the Fifteenth Air Force bombers.  They were greatly admired, and appreciated by the bomber crews as the Tuskegee Airmen effectively prevented any German fighter plane attacks.  McGovern's last mission was to Linz, Austria on April 25, 1945.  Less than two weeks later the Germans surrendered and the war in Europe ended.  During the last fifteen months, McGovern's group had flown 252 combat missions, lost 118 B-24s and suffered nearly 1,000 casualties-killed, wounded, missing or taken prisoner.  <br /> <br />In the chapters on combat, the text relate the effects of combat on the aircrews who were almost always exhausted after a B-24 mission.  In addition, the flying officers were well thought of by theirs crews as these officers looked after the well-being of the entire crew. The book's reporting of the various post-war assessments of the effectiveness of strategic bombing was interesting.  Luftwaffe commander Goring said target selection had been excellent.  Albert Speer, the minister of production, emphatically stated that strategic bombing could have won the war without a land invasion. Other German leaders said that the Allies had underestimated German industrial capacity. <br /> <br />After the war, McGovern and his crew flew several missions carrying food to war ravaged areas including Germany. On June 18,1945 McGovern and his crew flew a B-24 back home. Some returning veterans, including McGovern, when to college. Regarding B-24s, the author relates that in less than a year after the war, virtually all B-24 had been salvaged with only three aircraft remaining in museums today, only two still flying. <br /> <br />This is a very readable account of an aircraft and its crews who have been somewhat overshadowed by the more famous B-17. <br />	2005-01-31
US	51075913	R13FG5XE3JYA74	1841766925	604589303	Zeppelins: German Airships 1900–40 (New Vanguard)	Books	3	15	15	N	N	ZEPPELINS In WWI, etc.	The Introduction briefly reviews the German rigid airship (often referred to as Zeppelins)  designations used by the manufacturers, and the different designations used by each the German navy and army. While this resulted in each airship possessing two different designations for the navy this was straightforward but was somewhat inconsistent for the army. After the Introduction, six pages are devoted to a history of the development by Count Zeppelin of the rigid airship, 1900-1914. After the fiery loss of the Count's fourth airship, zeppelin-fever swept the German population who admired the perseverance of the old count, but the military remained lukewarm.   <br /> <br />In order to demonstrate his concept, Count Zeppelin founded the German Airship Transportation Company, known by its acronym DELAG. The text erroneously calls DELAG \\"the first commercial airline.\\" It was not an airline in the true sense as there were no scheduled intercity operations, but rather a cruise operation. Zeppelins traveled to various German cities conducting short-haul air tours of the German countryside (1). These flights were quite popular. The success of DELAG forced the navy and army to send their crews on DELAG airships for training and to place orders for military zeppelins (2). <br /> <br />The book devotes fourteen pages of text to a narration of zeppelins in WWI.  The German navy envisaged the role of rigid airship as reconnaissance. When the German fleet limited its fleet's battle actions there was little call for reconnaissance; and with the receipt of improved airships by the fleet, the zeppelin's role was primarily moved to strategic bombing. The book provides a brief account of zeppelin air raids.  With the development of incendiary bullets for aircraft machine guns in 1916, the new \\"Height-Climber\\" rigid airships were developed to fly at high altitudes to try to avoid destruction. Each rigid airship improvement was countered by a corresponding improvement in defensive aircraft.  After the army ceased to use rigid airships, in spite of heavy losses for strategic bombing the German navy continued to use rigid airship for bombing with the last bombing mission resulting in the fiery downing of L-70 in August 1918.  <br /> <br />Curiously, zeppelin naval scouts prompted the British to begin the development of the aircraft carrier with a zeppelin scout, LZ 100, in 1918 being destroyed by a Sopwith Camel launched from a lighter towed behind a navy destroyer. An interesting account is given of the attempted rescue mission to German East Africa by LZ-104.  When a German military force had surrendered and couldn't receive the supplies being carried to Sudan, LZ-104 returned to its base in Bulgaria after a nonstop flight of 95 hours covering 6,800 km. <br /> <br />Interestingly, Dr. Eckener, Count Zeppelin's collaborator and successor, immediately after WWI reactivated DELAG and built LZ 120, named BODENSEE. Unlike pre-WWI DELAG, BODENSEE, until taken over by the allies, flew scheduled passenger flights from Friedrichshafen to Berlin. The text concludes with a brief narration of the rigid airship after WWI until its demise following the Hindenburg's tragic 1937 crash.   <br /> <br />The author concludes that basically the rigid airship technology was a blind alley both militarily and commercially. This conclusion ignores the fact that the Graf Zeppelin, LZ-127, during its long career safely carried 13,000 passengers and in 1928 initiated regular passenger service to Brazil. In addition, transatlantic airplane passenger flights didn't begin until 1939 with large flying boats making numerous enroute-refueling stops. Before it's 1937 demise, in 1936 the zeppelin Hindenburg had a successful season making several nonstop North Atlantic round trip passenger flights. Not until 1957, twenty-one years after the Hindenburg's 1936 nonstop North Atlantic passenger flights, did scheduled direct nonstop service begin with DC-7s from New York to London. Today with stealth fighters and bombers, Concorde supersonic airliners and jumbo-jets, few people realize that from 1928 to May 1937 German airships dominated transoceanic passenger air travel.  The Germans had mastered rigid airship technology and flight, but hydrogen was the German zeppelin's Achilles heel.  Before WWII, the United States wouldn't sell Germany non-flammable helium for use in their zeppelins. <br /> <br />The book's best features are its many photographs and colored illustrations. The cut-away illustration of LZ-104 (L-59), the African Airship, is most useful to those unfamiliar with a late-WWI rigid airship design.  The text on WWI airship history is at best limited.  For a comprehensive work on German zeppelins in WWI, the serious reader/student should read Dr. Douglas Robinson's book The Zeppelin in Combat. <br /> <br />1 Douglas Botting, Dr. Eckener's Dream Machine (Henry Holt and Company, LLC) p58 <br />2 Ibid, p 59 <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-20

The first third of the text covers how both Northern and Southern factions in Missouri and neighboring states recruited and built military units. While Northerners and Southerners had differing motivations for going to war, they were remarkably similar in their commitments as \\"community pride ran high\\" and the army volunteer's reputations would become the home folks reputations as well. The volunteers made an unwritten social contract with their communities.  These military units had strong community identification so that in their home-towns companies were known by their local designations, for example as Pelican Rifles, in preference to regimental designations such as 3rd Louisiana Company C. <br /> <br />A well researched text covers the efforts of the Northerners and Southerners in Missouri and adjacent states to recruit, equip and train volunteer armies after Fort Sumter was fired on. When Union Captain Nathaniel Lyon was transferred to St. Louis, he began a crusade to rid the state of secessionists thereby further polarizing the state.  When Lyon was promoted to brigadier general in sole control of Federal fortunes in Missouri, he began organizing a Federal, but unauthorized, volunteer army. Lyon's attitude and prior experiences directly shaped his conduct in St. Louis, setting in motion a train of events that led to Wilson's Creek. Encouraged by the Governor, the secessionists redoubled their efforts to raise resisting units. The book gives considerable information on the composition of these military units, both Northern and Southern, with brief biographical notes on several of their officers and men.  <br /> <br />When Southern General Ben McCulloch learned that Union General Lyon had essentially declared war on Missouri, he immediately began shifting as many troops as possible to southwest Missouri. General Lyon moved to secure northern and central Missouri for the Union and then moved to confront the secessionist armies moving into southwest Missouri.  \\"By mid-July the forces that would fight the second battle of the Civil War were largely in place.\\" The Southern army under McCulloch planned to attack Springfield on August 10, 1861 but rain delayed their departure from the Wilson Creek area. Early on August 10, before McCulloch attacked Springfield, Union General Lyon launched an attack, the final phase of Lyon's \\"punitive crusade,\\" against Confederate General McCulloch. Lyon thought of himself as anointed to punish the secessionists. Rather than attacking down the road leading to the Southern army, he accepted Union General Sigel proposal that the army be divided with Sigel attacking the Southerners from the rear while Lyon attacked their left flank. <br /> <br />General Lyon attacked shortly after 05:00 A.M. on August 10 in an area later known as Bloody Hill while at 05:30 A.M. Sigel launched what \\"for its modest size, one of the most effective long range bombardments of the Civil War.\\" The text provides a concise and interesting narrative of the fierce fighting on Bloody Hill and of Sigel's action south of the Southerners. After Sigel was routed, he returned to Springfield. General Lyon was killed during the fighting on Bloody Hill and became one of the war's first martyrs. Command of the Union Army then devolved upon the senior Regular army officer Captain Samuel D. Sturgis. With Union General Sigel routed, ammunition running low, heavy causalities, and the Southerners massing for yet another bloody assault the only logical recourse was to retreat.  Therefore,Sturgis and his troops after seven hours of combat, retreated and returned to Springfield arriving around 05:00 P.M. <br /> <br />The book gives an interesting narrative about the level of medical care available to the combatants with graphic descriptions of the conditions in Springfield when the defeated army returned. The authors note \\"Compared to later Civil War battles, the number of men engaged at Wilson's Creek and the casualties suffered there were modest.\\" However, \\"....both in total numbers and as a percentage of the force engaged, Lyon's losses were greater than those of any battle in the Mexican War.\\" <br /> <br />As to be expected, early reports of the battle's results were misleading indicating a Northern victory; however, as later information was received a Southern victory was shown. For the combatants on both sides, it was clear that the men had fulfilled their social contract with their communities. Hometown newspapers were quick to proclaim that their community's honor had been upheld and the men were given a heroes welcome upon their return. The authors wrote \\"All of the men who fought at Wilson's Creek received accolades from their home communities....\\" In addition, \\"almost two dozen veterans of Wilson's Creek achieved the rank of general in either the Southern or Northern army.\\"  <br /> <br />The book ends noting \\"The surviving participants of the war shared a heritage of honor regardless of whether they had served in the Federal or Confederate armies.\\" However, for those who had deserted \\"Having broken the social contract between the community and its soldiers, having disgraced their town, their sins could never be forgotten.\\" <br /> <br />In part, the text does not flow smoothly and in places it is jumbled and run together.  However, this book will be of interest to both the serious and occasional reader of Civil War history. <br />	2005-01-17

The text states \\"Chester Alan Arthur hadn't wanted to become the nation's chief executive. He certainly hadn't aspired to be vice president\\" and Karabell further notes \\"....Chester Alan Arthur may have the distinction of being the president who derived the least amount of pleasure from being president.\\" Prior to becoming vice president he had been custom collector for the Port of New York, a well-paid lawyer and head of the New York Republican Party but had never been elected to public office. <br /> <br />He ran as Garfield's vice president in 1880, a campaign notable for what it lacked; \\"It was a contest of organization and will, not a battle over the future direction of the country.\\" Ideology was ignored with politicians viewing \\"order as the most important good.\\"  With Garfield's assassination, Arthur became president on September 20, 1881. The text notes \\"No one knew what direction the Arthur administration would take, not even Arthur himself\\" and observes \\"As it turned out, the qualities he did possess allowed him to rise farther than many others who were more intelligent, dynamic, and driven.\\" <br /> <br />He was president in an era when \\"the White House had shed much of the power it had acquired during the Civil War\\" and each national election was a patronage contest.  The assassination of Garfield placed the issue of civil service reform on the front burner. The response was the Pendleton Civil Service Act, the most memorable legislation to emerge from Arthur's presidency. Zachary Karabell's account of Arthur's presidency is brief but informative.  Besides civil service reform, the text covers Arthur's handling of Indian affairs, the Anti-Chinese sentiment, and his veto of the Rivers and Harbors Bill.  However, in 1882 the Republicans lost control of the House and Arthur's chances for a second term were slim.  PerhapsAuthor's most important contribution to the country was his resuscitation of the military.  The army was somewhat sustained because of the Indian wars, but in less than twenty years since the Civil War, the navy had lost almost 90 percent of its ships.  Arthur emphatically supported a plan to build ships \\"designed for offense and attack\\" and the text notes without Arthur \\"....[Teddy] Roosevelt and McKinley might not have had a navy capable of annihilating the Spanish in 1898.\\" In addition, this helped to prepare the United States for the foreign affair challenges of the twentieth century. <br /> <br />Having lost his base support, Arthur was not nominated for a second term.  The 1884 election was won by Grover Cleveland, a Democrat. As he left office Arthur was the object of warm political eulogies and the author writes \\"Arthur had become president with perilously low expectations, which he then exceeded.  In essence, most people concluded that the Arthur administration hadn't been half bad.\\" He died at age 56 less than two years after leaving office. <br /> <br />In conclusion, Karabell states Arthur \\"....tried to serve the general good rather than the interest of his faction...\\" and he \\"....did for civil service reform what he had done for most things in his life: he added a note of grace and honor, and the result was a balanced piece of legislation at a time when that was rare.\\" The author concludes \\"In everything he did, Chester Alan Arthur was a gentleman and that is rare and precious\\" and closes stating \\"Arthur managed to be a decent man, a decent president in an era when decency was in short supply.\\" <br /> <br />Americans would do well to read this brief biography of a somewhat obscure, laidback; but decent, honest, gentleman president. <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-12-09
US	51075913	RBG2MM2FDT6LS	0679456716	677265694	Castles of Steel: Britain, Germany, and the Winning of the Great War at Sea	Books	5	4	9	N	N	Britannia Rules the Waves - Maybe	The text opens with a review of the July 1914 diplomatic crisis and concludes with the scuttling of the German High Seas fleet at Scapa Flow. The author, Robert Massie, gives a concise narrative of the Great War at sea between Germany and Britain focusing on weapons and tactics together with covering the colorful/controversial military and political leaders. The well-written battle narratives (Jutland being the most famous) are most interesting as are the lesser battles in the Pacific and the Falkland Islands. <br /> <br />The German High Seas fleet was second only to the British Royal Navy with German dreadnoughts superior in armor and water-tight integrity while British dreadnoughts were faster and had larger guns.  These differences were due to the Royal Navy tactic, advanced by First Sea Lord Fisher father of the dreadnought warship, which was to get there first, hit hard, and leave quickly; while Admiral von Tirpitz's, founder of the Imperial German navy, maxim was \\"....that a ship's primary mission (is) to remain afloat.\\" Consequently, German warships, which were only slightly slower that the British dreadnoughts, could sustain multiple hits, remain afloat and continue to fight. <br /> <br /> <br />The concise narrative of the Gallipoli campaign espoused by Admiralty First Lord Churchill and grudgingly supported by The First Sea Lord Fisher is both interesting and well written.  As originally conceived it was an all Royal Navy effort (infantry could not be spared from France) to force the Dardanelles, occupy Constantinople, enter the Black Sea, take Turkey out of the war, and reopen a supply route to Russia. The naval effort was halted after March 18, 1915 when ships were damaged by mines.  Later information from American diplomats established that had the Royal Navy pressed on the fleet could have forced the straits leading to a \\"victory decisive upon the whole course of the war.\\"  After the naval efforts, attempted infantry operations were a dismal failure resulting in Churchill losing his cabinet post and ultimately the First Sea Lord Jacky Fisher leaving as well. <br /> <br />The Royal Navy fostered protests from neutral countries when they blockaded Germany.  In response Germany initiated a policy of unrestricted submarine warfare resulting in the torpedoing of the passenger liner Lusitania in May 1915 with the loss of several lives including 128 Americans. Kaiser William wishing to keep America neutral suspended unrestricted submarine warfare.  Now, Germany's only recourse was to weaken the Royal Navy. The Battle of Jutland, May 31,1916, resulted when the German High Seas Fleet tried to lure the British Grand Fleet into a surface battle trap.  The author devotes five interesting chapters to Jutland.  While the German battle fleet sank a greater number of ships than the British, they failed to seriously injure the Royal Navy, and at the end of the battle, the British battle fleet was positioned between the Germans and their safe home ports. The German fleet escaped during the night of May 31/June1.  <br /> <br />Mistakes were made by commanders in each fleet.  The author notes \\"Hipper (a German Admiral) made no mistakes at Jutland and was the only one of the fours senior admirals present to come away with his reputation enhanced.\\"  The book gives a succinct account of the political maneuvering and fall-out after Jutland.  British Admiral Jellicoe ultimately lost his command of the British Grand Fleet becoming First Sea Lord in the Admiralty. The Germans faced a serious problem: unable to weaken the British Grand Fleet and reduce the blockade which was strangling Germany yet forbidden by the Kaiser to use their most effective weapon, unrestricted submarine warfare, political maneuvering and debate commenced.  The major political issue for Germany was that returning to unrestricted submarine warfare would bring America into the war. Ultimately the German army high command, convinced the Kaiser that before America could become a factor Germany would win the war. Germany then resumed unrestricted submarine warfare. The text gives an excellent account of how Germany addressed this problem. <br /> <br />With the return of unrestricted submarine by the Germans, America entered the war. The author notes that the German gamble to win the war with an unrestricted U-boats offensive failed.  By July 31,1918 more than a million American soldiers were in Europe with many thousands more arriving each month.  The hand-writing was on the wall, \\"Germany could not win\\" so they responded to American President Wilson's peace offers and signed an armistice on November 11,1918.  A critical requirement of the 11 November armistice was that German warships and submarines would be surrendered to the Allies and would be brought to designated British ports awaiting disposition. German Admiral Reuters, German commander of the surrendered fleet at Scapa Flow, and his officers \\"all felt themselves still bound by a standing order of the Imperial Navy that no German warship was to be allowed to fall into enemy hands.\\" On 21 June 1919 Reuters gave the order, and the German navy scuttled their warships in Scapa Flow. On June 28, 1919 the Treaty of Versailles was signed, the German fleet was at the bottom of the sea, and the Great War was over. <br /> <br />This book by Robert Massie reads like a novel: smooth, interesting and always moving forward.  He brings the political maneuverings and personalities of the major players in both Britain and Germany into focus while narrating the critical naval events of WWI.  It's a lengthy work, 786 pages of text alone, but both the amateur and advanced student will find reading this work was worth the effort.  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-11-08
US	51075913	R2DSDIBNKF3YCO	0805069461	176251654	James Buchanan: The American Presidents Series: The 15th President, 1857-1861	Books	5	47	48	N	N	The Peter Principal Applied	The author, Jean Baker, wrote on page 1 \\"After the election of James Madison....no president had ever come to office with more impressive credentials. Nor, to this day, has any matched Buchanan's public positions.\\" Buchanan served in the Pennsylvania state legislature, served in the U.S. House and Senate, was Andrew Jackson's minister to Russia, was secretary of state under James Polk, and was minister to the Court of St. James in the 1850s.   <br /> <br />With his background, the question must be asked \\"why was Buchanan, arguably, our worst president?\\"  The author states \\"This book seeks to suggest some of the reasons for Buchanan's failure and specifically to explain the gap between Buchanan's experience and training before his presidency and his lamentable performance in office.... only in the literal sense did the Civil War begin.... When the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter.  It began in Buchanan's administration.\\" <br /> <br />The book outlines Buchanan's political career. While still a Unionist, by the 1830s he was \\"more and more a states rights man\\" as he gravitated toward southerners after arriving in Washington and considered New Englanders radical extremists.  By the 1840s, he opposed any interference with slavery and by then desperately wanted the presidency. In the Senate he espoused the principle of manifest destiny. As a bachelor he cultivated southern friends many of whom, as president, he included in his cabinet. <br /> <br />Having observed chief executives for more than thirty-five years, when Buchanan took the presidential oath in 1857, he knew more about the American presidency than anyone in the United States. However, the composition of his \\"cabinet revealed the incoming chief executive as no peacemaker....\\" Who was \\".... surrounded by advisers who agree with him.\\" The author narrates Buchanan's presidency as he moved from one ill-advised solution after another when solving critical problems.  He continued his strong pro-southern attitude andacted accordingly. He unethically influenced the court's decision on the Dred Scott case, and seriously mishandled the situation in Kansas. The author notes \\"By taking the side of the South, Buchanan had split the Democrats, and in the process he had ensured his nightmare: the election of a Republican in 1860....\\" stating \\"The destructive effects of the president's policy were immediately apparent in the 1858 fall congressional elections when a disproportionate number of northern Democrats lost....\\" <br /> <br />The text gives a fascinating account of Buchanan's final year as president.  The text notes that in 1857 Buchanan had sent troops into Utah to handle a problem with Brigham Young and the Mormons; yet when the secession crisis developed, and the Fort Sumter confrontation developed, he failed to respond firmly in like manner thereby encouraging secession.  Amazingly his southern cabinet members and political associates treasonably passed critical government plans and information to the seceding state governments.  Interestingly, the author notes \\"Buchanan's failing during the crisis over the Union was not inactivity, but rather his partiality for the south, a favoritism that bordered on disloyalty in an officer pledged to defend all the United States....\\" and continues \\"He was that most dangerous of chief executives, a stubborn, mistaken ideologue whose principles held no room for compromise.\\" <br /> <br />The last chapter addresses the question why did such an experienced and intelligent politician failed so miserably as president of the United States?  The text states \\"The answer speaks to one of the palpable characteristics of failed presidencies-the arrogant, wrongheaded, uncompromising use of power....\\"; and continues \\"His presidency did not suffer from feebleness or insufficient power or administration by a senile sixty-eight old.  But the problem that he used the power with such partiality for the South.\\" The author concludes \\"Ultimately Buchanan failed to interpret the United States.\\" <br /> <br />The reader may ask why study a failed presidency.  Such study is important for guidance it provides to future national leaders.  In the words of George Santayana \\"Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\\" The country can ill-afford another Buchanan type presidency. <br /> <br />Reading Buchanan's biography brings to mind the Peter Principle theory originated by Dr. Laurence J. Peter in 1969 regarding an individual being advanced to his level of incompetence. Clearly, Buchanan had a good resume; but when he advanced to a position where compromise, teamwork and leadership were paramount, he had reached his level of incompetence. <br /> <br />This should be a \\"must read\\" for those interested in the political/governmental aspects of the Civil War. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />	2004-09-09

Using the Battle of Gettysburg as the narrative vehicle, the author, Phillip Cole, has written an informative account of Civil War artillery. The author notes \\"Each army's artillery branch entered the war with little or nothing in the way of adequate manpower levels, trained officers, equipment necessities, and a reliable organization.\\" In addition, \\".... The artillery branches of each army were dogged with organizational problems that posed serious threats to the well-being of their respective forces.\\"  For the Confederates \\"Non-uniformity of weapons would prove to be an important impediment in making the Confederate's artillery organization an effective force.\\"  The text observes \\"The inventory that made up the huge supply of ammunition in both armies consisted of an enormous variety of projectiles to match the different caliber and model of artillery pieces.\\" <br /> <br />The text addresses a wide spectrum covering organization; artillery technology; gun types (smoothbore/rifled) including barrel material, support equipment and animals; an excellent review of artillery ammunition, gunpowder; projectile technology; artillery operations; requirements of artillerymen and a discussion of the Chiefs of Artillery: Hunt (Union) vs. Pendleton (Confederate). Each of these topics is well covered.  <br /> <br />Most interesting is the book's Chapter VI on Artillery Operations.  Gettysburg's July 3 artillery operations are used as the background for discussing both offensive and defensive artillery tactics. Author Cole writes \\"Offensively, artillery was an important force in securing success when combined with infantry operations.\\", but further notes \\"Over all, offensively (artillery) fire helped little when compared to what it provided to the defenders.\\" Chapter VI discusses the critical elements of artillery operations such as gun placement, targets, firing and aiming the gun, timing, choosing projectiles, etc. <br /> <br />Chapter VII reviews the gun crews where \\"Loading and firing cannons in battle required close attention to following safety precautions, alertness to obeying instructions, and teamwork\\" while \\"For artillery officers to operate in battle, it required extraordinary mental discipline and concentration.\\" Very interesting is this chapter's comparison of \\"....the two chiefs of artillery at the battle of  Gettysburg, history books ordinarily recognize (Union) General Hunt as performing superbly well and (Confederate) General Pendleton receives a rather dismal appraisal.\\" While the author does not try to be an apologist for Pendleton's performance but states the Confederate artillery organization did not provide its chief of artillery with the authority and a staff that was adequate. In contrast Union General Hunt at Gettysburg, where he had proper authority and control, performed effectively and valiantly; at one point Hunt rode to the battle line and emptied his revolver at the enemy having his horse killed under him.  <br /> <br />The author concludes noting \\"For whatever conclusions the reader arrives at in judging artillery's roles and performance at Gettysburg, this engagement underscored the significance of the artillery branch's organizational strengths and weakness, the integrity of its weapons and ammunition, and the successes and failures of its tactics.\\" <br /> <br />This is an excellent work for those interested in Civil War history. Many accounts of Civil War battles give attention to commanders, personnel, tactics, strategy and terrain noting only the presence and use of artillery. After reading this book, the reader will have a much better understanding of the proper use and significance of artillery when reading accounts of the American Civil War. <br /> <br />	2004-08-25

It is commonly called the Protestant Reformation....\\" (1) This book presents a concise and well-written biography of Martin Luther who initiated the revolution on October 31, 1517 when he nailed on the door of the Castle Church Wittenberg, Germany a document containing ninety-five thesis. Luther's intent was to bring his ideas to the attention of the church officials by inviting his fellow professors to debate. \\"In the thesis he objected to using indulgence money to build a great church in Rome and to the pope's claim he had power over souls in purgatory.\\" He further argued that \\"religion was a personal matter between God and man and that the Gospel of forgiveness in Jesus was all important.\\" <br /> <br />Luther from an early age was concerned about his relationship with God and the means to reach heaven. He entered a monastery and became a priest and as a professor at University of Wittenberg he studied the Bible. The text follows Luther as he evolved his Bible based religious philosophy including his confrontational relationship with the church in Rome. The text gives a brief, but good account, of the political aspects encountered. Elector Frederick protected Luther when needed while several German knights believed supporting Luther \\"...could help them in their own fight against the Roman Church. These men were especially angered at the pope's interference in their political affairs and his methods for draining large sums of money from Germany....\\" <br />Luther's refusal to recant at the Worms diet, placed him in physical danger so that when returning to Wittenberg his friends kidnapped him and placed him in the castle at Wartburg where he was known only as Knight George. During his stay at Wartburg, he completed a monumental work: his translation of the New Testament into German. Upon returning to Wittenberg, he embarked on a project to translate the Bible's Old Testament into German. His translations of the Bible helped define \\"the religious beliefs and practices of people around the world, build up the Saxon churches, it also furthered the Reformation throughout Germany and even influenced the development of the German language itself...\\" <br /> <br />While at Wartburg some of his followers began taking matters into their own hands creating chaos.  Luther's successful stand against both pope and emperor had given courage to many other religious leaders.... These now came out into the open, leading thousands of people down all kinds of strange paths. The author gives a compact but good narration of the political and theological issues in Germany as the Reformation developed noting that to try and unite the conflicting religious factions, the Holy Roman Emperor (Charles V) issued a call in 1530 for a diet at Augsburg, from which Luther was banned. The emperor was not successful in this effort to reunite the Western Church, but from this meeting the famous Augsburg Confession was written. While the Augsburg diet failed to unite the Western Church, the author notes \\"If Germany and the church could not be one, at least the princes could unite, for unless they were united, a single armed attack by their enemies might wipe out any gains they had made.\\" So not only did Augsburg not unite the church, it helped to insure that the Reformation would move forward.      <br /> <br />Luther lived almost 16 years after Augsburg dying at age 62 on February 18, 1546. The text closes noting that \\"Luther's life and legacy of faith gives shape and definition to the religious beliefs and practices of people around the world, and most especially to the church that bears his name.\\" <br /> <br />There have been several biographies written on Martin Luther. However, for those readers who want a concise, compact, very readable biography of Luther, this is an excellent book. <br /> <br />(1) Jacques Barzun, From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life,1500 to the Present   <br />   (2001 Perennial Edition) p-5. <br />	2004-08-02

The author addresses this problem writing a biography that concentrates on Hampton's Civil War activities telling the story of a remarkable and fascinating general. Born into a wealthy family in antebellum South Carolina, he was active in the family's business affairs, was an accomplished horseman and inherited from his paternal grandfather a sense of duty.  While a slaveholder, Hampton he remained a moderate and supported preserving the Union. <br /> <br />When South Carolina seceded Hampton wrote the governor offering to recruit, organize and finance a combat unit. Hampton was made a colonel in command of his unit. The text gives an interesting account of Hampton and his unit's baptism under fire at the First Battle of Manassas. Hampton was a military amateur, however, the author notes his first combat \\"... was a performance that would have done credit to a twenty-year veteran of the regular service.\\" <br /> <br />Hampton was promoted to brigadier general but was wounded at Fair Oaks and invalided to Richmond. When his unit was reorganized, Hampton was offered a command in J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry. The author notes Hampton's critical opinion of cavalry units in general and Stuart's flamboyant style in particular. Throughout the book, these criticisms of cavalry, J.E.B Stuart, and R.E. Lee are a most interesting. However, the author writes \\"The criticism that Hampton leveled at Stuart from time to time was not always accurate or fair.\\" Nevertheless, Hampton was a quick-learn on operations and cavalry tactics and received praise from Stuart and Lee. <br /> <br />His first dose of cavalry combat was at Second Manassas followed by Lee's Maryland campaign. He called the Maryland invasion a strategic miscalculation apparently ignoring its strategic potential. The author provides interesting narratives of Hampton's cavalry experience with Stuart.  The cavalry operations as Lee moved north into Pennsylvania. are described culminating with the July 2, 1862 cavalry engagements north of Gettysburg where Hampton received two serious head-wounds.  <br /> <br />After recovering from his wounds, Stuart assigned Hampton a division where he participated in the Mine Run campaign. The spring of 1864 saw the Grant/Meade campaign from the Wilderness to Petersburg. The text describes the several cavalry actions in which Hampton was engaged. Following J.E.B. Stuart's death at Yellow Tavern although Hampton and his command often received praise from Lee, Hampton was not formally made commander of the Cavalry Crops for three months. Hampton cavalry operations a Petersburg are well described. As commander Hampton was often praised and showed a \\"preference for dismounted fighting, a stark departure from his successor's reliance on mounted warfare with saber and pistol.\\" In an action that even Stuart would have been proud, Hampton and his cavalry rustled 2,486 Union cattle that helped to relieve the chronic hunger pangs of the Petersburg defenders. <br /> <br />Convinced that he could stop Sherman who was headed for South Carolina after capturing Atlanta and northern Georgia, Hampton applied to R.E. Lee and received permission to go to South Carolina \\"to oversee his commands rehabilitation and then lead it against Sherman....\\" Before leaving, Hampton was promoted to the rank lieutenant general, making him the highest-ranking cavalry commander of the war. However, as Columbia's local commander he made several mistakes trying to save the city and was accused by Sherman as being responsible for the fire that ravaged Columbia. When Joe Johnston was reinstated as overall commander in the western theater Hampton reported to him. The text describes Hampton's involvement in the military actions leading up to Johnston's surrender to Sherman. While his men were bound by the surrender, Hampton was unsure of his own status and proposed to fight on with Jefferson Davis.  <br /> <br />However, because of the wretched state of his family's finances he returned home to Columbia where he took an oath to abide by the constitution and was pardoned by President Andrew Jackson on November 13, 1865. The story of Hampton's postwar experiences is fascinating.  His debts were enormous and his assets were destroyed so that he was forced to declare bankruptcy in December 1868. He took a position in the life insurance industry, and in 1876 was elected governor of South Carolina. The author notes \\"His repeated calls for patience and restraint won him much favorable publicity not only locally but on the national level.\\" He continued to support and argue for fair and just treatment of black citizens. Less than six weeks after election to a second term he was elected to the US Senate where he served for 12 years. During his Senate terms, political enemies in South Carolina gained control ultimately ending his political activities. Still beloved by the people, when his home burned down in 1899, his neighbors built him a new and larger house. On April 11, 1902, surrounded by loved ones, at age eighty-four he died uttering the words \\"God bless all my people, black and white.\\" <br /> <br />	2004-07-30

After MacArthur landed on Leyte in the Philippines, the Japanese countered by sending battleship/cruiser groups to attack the transports and supply ships at the beachhead: the Southern Force under Admiral Nishmura to attack from the south; the Center Force under Admiral Kurita to attack from the north; and the Northern Force with its aircraft carriers under Admiral Ozawa as a decoy to Halsey 3rd Fleet carriers.<br />The Southern Force was devastated on the night of October 24 in the Surigao Straits by American Admiral Oldendorf's old battleships. Halsey had failed to leave a battleship/cruiser force to guard the San Bernardino Strait and had fallen for the lure of Ozawa's decoy and moved north to attack the Japanese carriers. Therefore, the Center Force at 3:00 A.M. October 25 passed unchallenged through the San Bernardino Strait and entered the Philippine Sea north of Samar. At 6:47 A.M. an American pilot from Taffy 3 spotted the Japanese heading south. American Admiral Kinkaid's 7th Fleet protected the Leyte beachhead with three Task Units comprised of escort carriers (CVE), destroyers (DD) and destroyer escorts (DE). Kinkaid's only Task Unit in a position to intercept the Japanese force was Taffy 3.  <br />The author, James D. Hornfischer, has written an excellent narrative of outgunned and out numbered Taffy 3's battle to protect the 7th Fleet and the Leyte beachhead. The text presents a brief description of the characteristics of Taffy 3's ships: 6 escort carriers, 3 destroyers and 4 destroyer escorts. The USS Samuel B. Roberts, DE-413, is used as the narrative vehicle, and a brief history of this destroyer escort from its 1944 commissioning to the Samar battle is given. Although in-depth narration is given the actions of Taffy 3 ship captains and officers, the text devotes considerable narrative to enlisted men and their magnificent performance under fire.<br />On page 165, the author notes &quot;By any measure the mathematics of the engagement were preposterously against them&quot; as destroyers and destroyer escorts were not designed to fight battleships and cruisers. However, they were all that stood between the Japanese and the CVEs and the Leyte beachhead. Unfortunately Taffy 3's in-flight aircraft carried bombs and ammunition for attacking ground forces limiting them only to harassing the Japanese warships. On instinct, Commander Evans, Captain of the destroyer USS Johnston, ahead of orders engaged the Japanese and launched a torpedo attack that struck the cruiser Kumano ripping off its bow. With salvos from the Japanese warships landing close to Taffy 3s carriers, Admiral Clifton Sprague ordered his destroyers into the breach. Ultimately, the escort destroyers were also ordered into the battle. The text notes &quot;It was preposterous to send a destroyer escort against an enemy's main surface fleet....Bob Copeland's ship (Samuel B. Roberts) was fighting like a true hunter-killer bidding to take down a heavy cruiser on the open sea.&quot; As the Roberts headed for battle a carrier officer remarked  &quot;Look at that little DE committing suicide.&quot; <br />The author gives an excellent account of the gallant battle put up by the destroyers and destroyer escorts. Regarding the destroyer USS Heermann, the author writes &quot;Few warships in history had ever spent ten minutes more productively.&quot;  In spite of the tin can's (DD's and DE's) efforts, the CVE Gambier Bay was soon bracketed by shells, was hit and sank becoming the only U.S. carrier of the war sunk by surface fire. The tin cans of Taffy 3 held the line until airplanes armed to attack surface ships came to turn the tide so that Taffy 3's tin cans would no longer have to carry the hopeless fight any longer. As the text correctly states &quot;The men of the destroyers and destroyer escorts had helped win a victory of the most impossibleresounding kind. Their dashing skippers had put themselves on the line first and started an improbable rout. Now.... avenging angels from the escort carrier squadrons, would help finish it.&quot; The price, however, was high, as two destroyers and one destroyer escort (Samuel B. Roberts) were sunk in addition to the CVE Gambier Bay. During the battle, the war's first kamikaze sinking occurred when the CVE St.Lo was sunk by kamikaze aircraft. <br />Tragically, it was not until10:10 A.M. two days later that a seven-ship rescue task group rescued 1,150 battle survivors. Because of the rescue delay, some 116 men had died at sea while a few others made it over land to safety. The author's account of the survivor's ordeal awaiting rescue is gripping.<br />&quot;The Battle of Samar was a battle of firsts: the first time a U.S. aircraft carrier was destroyed by surface gunfire; the first time a ship was sunk by a suicide plane.... ; the last time small destroyers charged an opposing battle line.&quot; According to Admiral Nimitz &quot;The history of the United States Navy records no more glorious two hours of resolution, sacrifice, and success.&quot; The American invasion of the Philippines could have suffered a critical setback had the Japanese prevailed off Samar and attacked MacArthur's transports. The officers and men of Taffy 3 were indeed part of the &quot;Greatest Generation.&quot;.  James Hornfischer narrates their sacrifices and success in riveting detail.	2004-07-10

However, the Underground existed for centuries before WWII. Chapter 1 succinctly narrates the Underground during the Blitz, and concludes stating \\"....to understand the full complexity of what lies under London, we must begin with her subterranean rivers.\\"<br />Chapter 2 notes \\"There are over a hundred miles of rivers in London, fed by over a hundred springs and wells....Hidden from view, recalled only in street names....\\" As early as 1463 a Royal Act ordered \\"The covering-in of the Walbook's middle and lower reaches\\" vaulting and  paving it over. These rivers were covered over or diverted into tunnels. Many of the rivers underground became more sewers than rivers. The text also notes \\"There are several lost rivers under London referred to by London's chroniclers but impossible to trace.\\" <br />The text devotes several chapters to the development of underground sewers, water systems, gas pipes, trains, and later telegraph, telephone and electricity systems. The text gives captivating accounts of several engineering problems that were confronted, how they were resolved together with thumbnail sketches of the engineers and managers involved. . Tunneling under the Thames River was a major venture taking fifteen years to complete. Most intriguing is the account of The London Hydraulic Power Company founded in 1871where \\"Raw water (untreated) water was pumped at a pressure of 400 pounds per square inch through the miles of pipes running beneath London, and was used to raise and lower cranes, operated lifts.... theatre safety curtains, wagon hoists, even hat hat-blocking presses....\\" Amazingly the company survived until the mid-1970s. <br />As telegraph lines were developed underground, the Post Office gained control of the telegraph system and later gained control of the telephone system which they tried to suppress. As electricity developed around a national grid, distribution moved underground and by WWII was operating as a national industry. After the dropping of the first atomic bomb, the British government considered operating from the underground but by the 1960s gave up plans to fighting and surviving a nuclear war from under London. The text notes that new water and electricity tunnels characterized the 1980s and early 1990s with \\"The biggest capital project under London in the last ten years has been the completion of the London Ring Water Main\\" <br />This is a fascinating book and the reader will be amazed by the extensive underground systems under London that are still in use today.	2004-06-06

Conversely, with its seaports blockaded, unhampered ability to move men and supplies eastward on and across the Mississippi River was critical for Confederate survival. Thus, the Mississippi River was of strategic importance to both the Union and the Confederacy.<br />The text notes that New Orleans was the South's largest, wealthiest, and most industrialized city. However, New Orleans surrendered to Farragut in 1862, only one year after Fort Sumter. The Federals then began the complex/long campaign, not completed until July 1863, to clear the entire Mississippi River. By the spring of 1863, Vicksburg and Port Hudson were the only two Confederate forts blocking the Mississippi River. The authors, William L. Shea and Terrence J. Winschel, present an interesting narration of the campaign of Grant's progress down the river to Vicksburg and General Banks march north to an unfilled union with Grant. In many respects this was a trial and error campaign; Grant found that it was almost impossible to attack Vicksburg from the north or west, and he decided to cross the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg and attack the city from the southeast or east. <br />Most interesting during this campaign was the successful combined operations of army and navy resources. Admiral Porter made a dramatic run down the Mississippi past the Vicksburg batteries in order to ferry Union soldiers across the river below Vicksburg. In addition, while Vicksburg was under siege, Porter bombarded the city with his naval cannons.<br />After much bloody fighting east of Vicksburg, in May 1863 Grant's army reached the Vicksburg fortifications. After two unsuccessful direct assaults on the Rebels, a series ofthirteen trenches were dug to the very face of the Confederate fortifications bringing Vicksburg under siege and sealing its doom. When completed over sixty thousand feet of excavations, manned by Union troops, were completed. By July Vicksburg's Confederate General Pemberton and his soldiers were hungry, sick and despaired of rescue. On July 3 General Pemberton asked Grant for surrender terms; Grant's answer was \\"unconditional surrender.\\" Grant rejected Pemberton proposed surrender terms and promised to send amended terms of surrender that night to Pemberton that he accepted early on July 4.<br />The authors review the question of the lack of Confederate aid for Vicksburg noting that by early June, Richmond had sent Johnston thirty-two thousand troops and urged General Joe Johnston to relieve Vicksburg. Apparently Johnston never intended to save Vicksburg. Grant next moved east to turn on General Johnston. After eight weeks, Johnston abandoned Jackson, Mississippi and fled east eastward away from Grant.<br />The text concludes with an account of the battle for Port Hudson. Like Grant, Union General Banks, made a direct assault on the Rebel fortifications with disastrous results.Banks next initiated digging the way into Port Hudson; but impatient for results, tried another disastrous direct assault on June 14. Upon receiving word of Vicksburg surrender, Port Hudson surrendered on July 9, and General Banks informed Grant \\"The Mississippi is open.\\". On July 16 the steamboat Imperial, eight days out of St. Louis, docked in New Orleans. The struggle for the Mississippi River was over.<br />This is a readable account. Most interesting is to witness the development of General Grant into a first rate field general. The last chapter in the book is an EPILOGUE that provides a brief account after Vicksburg of several major commanders after Vicksburg.	2004-05-11

From 1916 through 1918, critical diplomatic skirmishes over war strategy between the United States and Britain took place. Prior to 1917, Wilson pursued a policy of  \\"peace without victory\\" while the British wanted direct American involvement.  When the United States entered the war in April 1917, the military situation of the western allies was critical: France's army was exhausted and ready to mutiny; Britain was incurring a substantial economic burden while its army faced critical manpower shortages; and Russia on the eastern front was collapsing with the Bolsheviks taking over and suing for peace with Germany. Britain wanted American infantry to serve directly in the British lines as combat replacements under British command. American General Pershing and a small staff rushed to France in May 1917 where \\"Pershing and his staff sought the creation of an independent American army...\\" as the build up and training of American Expeditionary Force began. Wilson concurred in Pershing's strategy.<br />Professor Woodward, the author, presents a comprehensive study of Anglo-American relations during the WW I as mutual distrust and political maneuvering resulted in a deterioration of the relationship between the two countries. Wilson sought to have a strong or dominant America when formulating postwar peace terms while Lloyd George was concerned about maintaining a strong postwar diplomatic and military position for the British Empire. The text concentrates on diplomatic and war strategy issues during WWI referring to the battlefield only as background for the situations being narrated. Most interesting is the account of Lloyd George's attempts to move infantry from the western front to the Middle East to insure protection of the Empire'sAsian interests. Woodward's description of Britain's unsuccessful efforts to get Japan to invade eastern Siberia to prevent Germany from overrunning Russia, after its military collapse, is fascinating.<br />The author notes \\"The war's unexpected conclusion in November\\" 1918] \\" could not have been more advantageous to the British Empire's geopolitical goals.\\" President Wilson \\"planned to force the Allies to discuss peace on his terms\\" i.e. Wilson's Fourteen Points which the Allies accepted with reservations. The text concludes with the statement \\"Despite America's and Britain's common struggle against Germany, Wilson's substitution of moral for traditional diplomacy and his self-appointed role as the Peoples' spokesman militated against the creation of a postwar Anglo-American partnership to maintain the future peace and stability of the world....He placed the maintenance of American freedom of action second only to the defeat of Germany.\\" Woodward further states \\"The failure to achieve a true Anglo-American partnership during and after the war thus represented a great setback to world stability....\\"<br />An appendix listing a cast of characters in alphabetical order with one or two sentences given for each would be most helpful. However, this is an excellent work and is a must read work to gain a full understanding of a critical phase of twentieth century history.	2004-04-05

However, the author, Kirkpatrick Sale, states \\"....the steamboat would be the single most important instrument in the transformation of America in the first half of the nineteenth century: it promoted the penetration and settlement of the American interior....\\" The text narrates Fulton's life placing him in proper historical context.<br />Chapter 1 is an account of the very successful August 1807 maiden voyage of the Fulton's steamboat, North River (erroneously called the Claremont in textbooks), from New York to Albany and return. Following this successful trip, Fulton initiated regular steamboat service on the Hudson from New York to Albany which ceased only when the Hudson River froze. While not the inventor of the steamboat, Fulton was successful because he built the North River \\"on sound engineering principles and scientific techniques.\\"<br />The text states that little is known about Fulton's early life, He was born on a farm in 1765 in Pennsylvania to Irish immigrant parents. He developed a strong drive to avoid his father's poverty, and in his mid-teens he moved alone to Philadelphia and was apprenticed to a jeweler. In 1787 he arrived in London (source of funds unknown) for further art study under Benjamin West. It was a difficult time for would-be artists and in 1793 he began devolving into engineering concentrating first on canals. He conceived many inventions such as a marble-cutting saw, a canal-digging engine, prefabricated iron bridges, etc. In 1797 he went to France. Sale gives an intriguing account of  Fulton's attempt to sell a submarine and mines (Fulton called them torpedoes) first to Napoleon in France; then later to England when he was rejected by France. Amazingly Fulton tried unsuccessfully to blackmail both countries by threatening to reveal his work to their enemies.<br />In Paris in 1802 Fulton met Robert Livingston who wanted to build and operate a steamboat on the Hudson River. A partnership was formed and Fulton was obligated to build a steamboat to ply the Hudson; however, the author notes \\"Fulton knew from the outset that it would be on the Mississippi and its major tributaries that the steamboat would have its most consequential impact....\\" In 1803 he conducted a successful trial run of a prototype steamboat on the Seine, and in December 1806 Fulton returned to America where in 1807 Fulton's commercially successful North River began operations. The book gives a good account of how Fulton and Livingston with state granted monopolies developed steamboat traffic on the Hudson and Mississippi Rivers plus steam ferries to New Jersey. Incredibly, in 1808-09, he lobbied for his torpedoes in Washington.<br />For the 1808 season, Fulton refurbished the North River \\"offering accommodations of some taste and luxuriousness\\" rather than the somewhat spartan 1807 conditions. Later steamboats would continue this luxurious accommodation pattern. By early 1813, he had six steamboats at work and six more ready to launch.<BR>The author notes \\"Steamboating was too obviously lucrative an enterprise-everyone of Fulton's boats was making money, some robustly so-not to attract any craftsman or entrepreneur who could find a source of modest capital and a machine shop with a few experience hands. By 1814 at least a dozen other men had launched vessels of their own....\\" Fulton and Livingston would spend the last years of their lives defending their monopolies with Fulton carrying on alone after Livingston's death in 1813. When Fulton died in 1815 his monopolies were essentially ended. Strangely, until the end of his life, his passion was his weapons of war, none of which were successful, rather than the steamboat.<br />The book's last chapter, titled Legacies, is most interesting as it outlines the history of the steamboat after Fulton's death noting that the steamboat was central to drawing people to middle America. Mark Twain wrote \\"The 19th Century began the most prolific age of invention, bringing into our daily life the convenience of machines which were recently unknown but in our dreams. At the beginning of that period of material progress stands the name of Robert Fulton.\\" The author notes sadly on page 176 \\"No lasting monuments, not even a gravestone, were erected [to Robert Fulton] until 1901 when the American Society of Mechanical Engineers put up a bronze plaque on a squat column along the south wall of Trinity churchyard.\\"<br />The book's closing sentence states \\"And none who ever rode its throbbing decks, or watched its majestic motility on the water, ever failed to realize that it was this the symbol, as it was for many years the agency, of the American dream.&quot;	2004-03-08

However, the South lacked the organization, operational doctrine and planning needed to meet their army's growing supply needs. To correct this problem, in March1861 Jefferson Davis appointed Major Abraham C. Myers, a West Point graduate and career staff officer, Quartermaster General. The author, Harold Wilson, narrates the supply problems that developed as \\"Myer's strict adherence to.... antiquated regulations earned few friends among field officers.\\" In addition, Myers \\"failed to grasp modern notions of efficiency and system\\" plus \\"he lacked ability to plan.\\" In contrast the Ordnance Bureau under Josiah Gorgas was well organized and properly administered.<br />The text recounts the numerous problems in the Quartermaster Department and with the textile manufacturers who had problems maintaining their workforce. Some manufacturers were accused of \\"illicit rewards\\" while at the same time they faced run-away inflation. Despite the concession of vast martial powers to Myers, the Confederacy had limited ability to clothe its troops. For example, the battle of Gettysburg was participated by Rebel troops attempts to secure badly needed shoes in the town of Gettysburg. <br />\\"When Myers could not provide the necessary refit for the army, he lost any remaining confidence in his leadership among the line officers.\\" In July 1863, Brigadier General Alexander R. Lawton was appointed quartermaster general. After failing to sustain Longstreet's army in Tennessee, Lawton initiated a survey of available Confederate resources and reformed the production operations of the bureau. His reforms met great success in Virginia and Georgia; however, strong opposition developed in North Carolina.\\" The account of Governor Vance and North Carolina's opposition to Lawton's policies is most interesting. <br />\\"By the end of 1864, Lawton's reputation as a supplier stood high.\\" However, pressing clothing shortages continued, as the naval blockade limited imports and Federal troops burned factories and raw materials. It was found \\"that large quantities of government clothing are possessed by persons in civil life, and by dealers\\" as these articles were sold by troops who hadn't been paid in months, or the articles had been abandoned in the field or the dealers had purchased direct from the manufacturers. Most interesting, the Confederacy in 1862 had initiated a \\"scoured earth policy\\" to prevent useful assets falling under Union control so that as Sherman and other Union generals marched through the South, both the Union and Confederate armies were destroying facilities.<br />The author's account of blockade running to supplement domestic supplies is interesting. The text notes \\"Until the end of the war, most garments and goods provided to the Confederate army came from domestic resources through Alexander Lawton's mobilization of manufacturing.\\" Most intriguing, was the fact that the Confederate government entered into an agreement with William Crenshaw to build and operate blockade-runners. Private vessels were eminently more profitable than Crenshaw's operation, nevertheless  Crenshaw continued to operate after heavy loss of ships. Since domestic sources supplied many goods and garments, in addition the runners brought in critically needed new machinery and spares. \\"As Confederate funds in Europe dwindled, the export of cotton became more critical.\\" So that blockade running became a two-way process with the blockade- runners leaving with cotton to pay for items received.<br />When Wilmington , North Carolina fell, blockade running ceased. \\"When Lee surrendered at Appomattox on April 9 and Johnston at Durham's Station on April 26, Confederate quartermaster and commissary stores were mostly depleted....General Lawton's system of supply was in shambles.\\" The text now relates the tortuous process of reconstruction which under President Johnsonadhered \\"to a `white man's country' philosophy and the adoption of a lenient policy toward the defeated South....\\" Johnson worked with the manufacturers, railroaders, former Confederate officers, etc to revive the South's economy based on manufacturing and technology. Also, to forestall greater chaos, President Johnson quickly moved to restore civil government in the south. By 1870 manufacturing approached it 1860 level.<br />The author devotes several pages to the problems of Radical Reconstruction that followed President Johnson's lenient policies. Radical Reconstruction produced years of violence and political uncertainty. The book notes \\"Only a token number of southern manufacturers braved the threats of violence and participated in the new Radical state governments.\\" Most violence was initiated by southerners who resisted giving equal political and social rights to the freemen. Wilson observes that after the end of reconstruction, in the emerging New South there were the problems of discriminatory freight rates, the growth of trusts that violated the practices of the free market economy, the lack of credit for farmers, and the failure of the states to properly control working conditions. Sadly, the author notes \\"As grievous as the problems were, they were far more amenable to solution than had been the slavery controversy.\\"<br />This is a well-researched and heavily documented work. However, it is not a very readable book. The author tends to become repetitious by presenting far too many examples for each point that he makes when he could have given just a few examples and included the balance in appendices. In addition, the author basically limits this work to the textile and clothing manufacturers in the South, essentially ignoring critical metal working, foundry and munitions manufacturing operations. The strategic Tredegar Iron Works is only listed in the Introduction.  However, serious students and Civil War \\"buffs\\" will find much useful information as the text provides the other side of the story about supply shortages suffered by the Confederate armies in the field.	2004-02-06
US	51075913	R1R2J2H7PWQVLV	0684807610	438783610	Benjamin Franklin: An American Life	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Advocate of an American Middle Class Society	In the last chapter of the book the author noted \\"...we must rescue Franklin from the schoolbook caricature of a genial codger flying kites in the rain and spouting homespun maxims about a penny saved being a penny earned. We must also rescue him from the critics who would confuse him with the character he carefully crafted in his Autobiography.\\" and the text continues \\"To assess Franklin properly, we must view him, instead, in all his complexity.\\"  Walter Isaacson, the author, does an excellent job rescuing Benjamin Franklin in this biography. <br />Franklin grew up in Boston where he was expected to attend Harvard and become a minister. Franklin lacked interest in religion, and at age ten his father placed Franklin in an apprenticeship later becoming an apprentice in his brother's print shop. With this redirection, Isaacson notes \\"...Franklin acquired something that was perhaps just as enlightening as a Harvard education: the training and experiences of a publisher, printer, and newspaperman.\\" In addition, Franklin was an avid reader and was self-educated in many areas. At age 17 Franklin ran away from home and began a printing apprenticeship in Philadelphia. The text gives an excellent narrative of Franklin's history as he progressed as a printer, author, publisher, philosopher, scientist and finally a diplomat. Throughout his long career, Franklin retained his affection for the middle class and its virtues of hard work and frugality while opposing the privileges of inheritance and wealth. <br />Chapter Six provides an account of Franklin's accomplishments as a scientist and inventor. \\"His work on electricity was recognized as ushering in a scientific revolution....\\" And \\"the terms positive and negative charges devised by Franklin are the ones we still use today.\\"<br />The author's gives a fascinating account of Franklin's assignment in Great Britain where Franklin concluded \\"Britain would therefore be best served....by treating the people of the colonies as fullcitizens of the empire, with the same liberties and economic aspirations.\\" The reader can only speculate what the United States and the world would be like today had Britain accepted Franklin's vision of the British Empire. When it became clear that Britain has little sympathy for colonial rights, Franklin became an American patriot. Now a political outcast in Britain, Franklin nevertheless tried informally to resolve the crisis; but failing in this endeavor, he returned to America in April 1775 where he became a signers of the Declaration of Independence.<br />With the onset of the Revolution, Franklin was sent to France where he was received as the world's most famous America. Isaacson narrates Franklin's effective diplomatic work in France noting that \\"into his hands, almost as much as those of Washington and others, had been placed the fate of the Revolution\\" and notes \\"he would display a dexterity that would make him the greatest American diplomat of all times.\\" Here \\"in his spare time Franklin perfected one of his most famous and useful invention: bifocal glasses.\\" When the Revolution ended and the peace treat with Britain was signed, Franklin returned to America. The text now gives an interesting account of Franklin's contributions at the 1787 Constitutional Convention where he proposed the critical workable compromise. He proposed that Representatives to the lower House would be popularly elected and apportioned by population, but in the Senate \\"the Legislatures of the several States shall choose and send an equal number of Delegates.\\" After the Convention, in the last year of his life, he embarked on a public mission to abolish slavery presenting a formal abolition petition to Congress in February 1790. The petition was rejected by Congress. At the age of 84, Franklin died on April 17, 1790.<br />The text gives a balanced account of Franklin, noting his poor family relations which included a physical abandonment of his wife. He also effectively separated control and affection of some of his grandchildren from their parents. Regarding Franklin's womanizing, Isaacson concludes \\"Among his many reputations was that of a legendary and lecherous old lover who had many mistresses among the ladies of Paris. The reality....was somewhat less titillating. His fames female friends were mistresses only of his mind and soul. Yet that hardly made their relationships less interesting.\\"<br />The last chapter titled CONCLUSIONS is extremely interesting as the assessment of Franklin over time is given. He was popular following his death, but in the early 1800s was rejected during the philosophic Romantic Era that followed the Age Of Enlightment. His star ascended again following the Civil War, but the pendulum again swung against him in the 1920s. Today Franklin receives mixed but generally positive reviews.<br />Everything the reader would want to know about Ben Franklin is answered in this book while Walter Isaacson rescues him from the image of \\"a genial codger flying kites in the rain.\\"	2004-01-13
US	51075913	R2W85C9F51BMRR	B00008AJCF	244559708	Tuxedo Park	Books	4	6	7	N	N	THE LAST GREAT AMATEUR	Today with university and industrial labs conducting research using multi-million dollar grants and government contracts, it is amazing that in before the 1930s a brilliant banker had established, financed and staffed a private research lab that was superior at the time to university laboratories. This book by Jennet Conant is the story of Albert Lee Loomis who not only established his lab in Tuxedo Park, NY, he also personally conducted research there. Outstanding scientists such as Albert Einstein, Enrico Fermi, Neils Bohr, etc. visited his lab with Einstein describing the lab as a \\"place of science.\\"<br />Loomis while interested in science at Yale nevertheless when to Harvard Law School and upon graduation entered the New York law firm of Winthrop &amp; Stimson; Stimpson was a cousin of Loomis. During WWI, Loomis jointed the army, received a commission and was sent to Aberdeen Proving Ground where he struck up a friendship with Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University, considered America's most brilliant experimental physicist, who later became Loomis' mentor. One year after WWI Loomis went to work in the investment business and later with his brother-in-law as partner purchased their employer. Recognizing the approaching financial crisis of 1929, the partners took appropriate action, with Loomis making $50 million during the first years of the Depression.<br />Loomis had established his lab at Tuxedo Park in the 1920s leaving the day-to-day running of the lab to a lab manager. Loomis worked in the lab evenings and on weekends, working alongside accomplished scientists. In 1934 he quit Wall Street for good devoting fulltime to his lab. The text notes \\"He played a major role in the development of the electroencephalograph, which went on to become an extremely valuable diagnostic tool and is used routinely in hospitals to detect epilepsy as well as many other diseases.\\" <br />Loomis and other scientists became concerned about reports of German advanced weaponry; andaided by MIT, Tuxedo Park, devoted its work to the development of secret war-related radar systems to detect airplanes. When the 1940 British technical mission came to America, they brought their magnetron oscillator; Loomis immediately recognized that a major breakthrough had occurred in radar development. Loomis lead the establishment of a secret radar lab at MIT, closed his lab and shipped his valuable equipment to MIT. \\"For the next four years, he would drive himself and his band of physicists almost without break to develop the all-important radar warning systems based on the magnetron.\\" Also, Loomis conceived the basis for and directed the development of the Loran navigation system, a system critical for accurate aircraft navigation during bombing missions.<br />In 1941 Loomis's involvement with the MIT Lab, called the Rad Lab, became increasingly sporadic as he was pressed into service on uranium research. One leading scientist noted \\"...it was a great stroke of luck for the country that Loomis was involved in the uranium project from the beginning, not as an originator of ideas as much as an individual who knew how to exploit them...\\" contributing to \\"the remarkable lack of roadblocks experienced by the Army's Manhattan District, the builders of the atomic bombs.\\" <br />By June 1943 nearly 6000  radar set based on the MIT Rad Lab designs had been delivered with production climbing past 2000 sets per month. In the opinion of many of his peers, Loomis' greatest contribution lay in the brilliant manner he and the Secretary of War, his cousin Henry Stimson, had overcome military resistance to the flow of innovative ideas and applications.... and the military's acceptance of new weapons and systems. The author does an excellent job narrating Loomis' wartime work outlining his contributions in many areas.<br />In 1945 Loomis divorced his wife and married his mistress, the wife of his former Tuxedo Park lab manager. This produced strong reverberations in his elitefinancial and social circles. In 1947 he completed his administrative duties associated with radar and almost from the moment that the MIT Rad Lab ceased, Loomis began to disappear. In 1948 he was awarded the highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Merit. The book closes with an EPILOGUE which gives brief accounts of the post WWII lives of the key scientists and others with whom Loomis was associated during his active career. Loomis died in 1975 at age eighty-seven.<br />My main criticism is the account of Oppenheimer's opposition to the H-bomb in the EPILOGUE which concludes with the statement \\"Oppenheimer was ousted from power and publicly disgraced\\" leaving the impression Oppenheimer spent the rest of his life in disgrace. The text fails to tell that later the Atomic Energy Commission cleared Oppenheimer of all charges and in 1963 awarded him their highest honor the Enrico Fermi award. Oppenheimer served as director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton from 1947 to his retirement in 1966. <br />This was a difficult book to write, not only because of Loomis' countless activities, but because he destroyed his papers before his death. Consequently, the book does not always read smoothly. Nevertheless, the book provides valuable material not available from other sources.	2003-12-04
US	51075913	R38BV06AEN7TI	0801867347	529528102	Zeppelin!: Germany and the Airship, 1900-1939	Books	5	5	5	N	N	"UP SHIP" - ZEPPELIN	In the INTRODUCTION the author notes \\"... Germany in the first half of the twentieth century offers an especially valuable case study of the intersection of technology and culture.\\" Readers often think of Zeppelin history solely in terms of the Hindenburg crash; but in Europe from 1908 to 1939, the Zeppelin was a powerful technological and cultural symbol that was manipulated during the Germany's Imperial, Weimar and Nazi eras for both political and business gain. The Zeppelin was a gigantic, magnificent machine and drew excited responses from all who witnessed it in flight.<br />The text gives a brief account of airship development focusing on Count Zeppelin's (a retired army officer) efforts to develop a rigid airship. Following the loss of Zeppelin's   fourth airship, LZ 4, spontaneous public money donations provided funds for Count Zeppelin to continue his work. The approach of World War I finally drew military interest in the Zeppelin. The Zeppelin's military achievements were limited; but the allies hated it as a terror weapon thereby providing justification for the postwar dismantling of the Zeppelin Company.  However, the tremendous technological development during the war indicated a bright future for the Zeppelin in luxury air travel and scientific exploration. <br />Count Zeppelin died in 1917 and Dr. Hugo Eckener became the postwar Zeppelin Company's leader. In the postwar period, the Zeppelin as a symbol of German technology and culture greatly increased. The author gives an excellent account of the Zeppelin Company working to survive and avoid dismantlement as required by the Versailles Treaty. The company first survived by furnishing a Zeppelin, ZR 3, to the United States as war reparations. Its delivery by a transatlantic flight in October 1924 was perceived as demonstrating that German technology, enterprise and workmanship lead to success. The author relates how the Weimar Republic capitalized on this perception. The author notes that in 1925 \\"...the issue of destroying the airship works dominated the Zeppelin company's concerns.\\" Believing that a new airship would demonstrate the commercial feasibility of the transoceanic air travel, a public fund raising campaign for a new Zeppelin was initialed in August 1925.  Less than half of the needed funds were raised. Government funds together with funds from Zeppelin subsidiaries supplied the balance of funds needed. The Versailles Treaty restrictions on airship building were lifted in 1926 and the new airship (LZ 127) was built. Christened Graf Zeppelin in July 1928 it became one of the most famous aircraft in history. The text narrates the career of the Graf Zeppelin during the declining years of the Weimar Republic including a 1929 round-the-world flight with only four stops and a 1931 scientific flight to the Arctic. Politics continued to be an ever-present companion in all activities.<br />Chapter 6 titled \\"Political Zeppelinism-Manipulating Airship Culture, 1933-1939\\" is most intriguing. The totalitarian Nazi regime had a problem dealing with the Zeppelin, a strong national symbol that predated them. Air Minister Hermann Goring hated them and Adolph Hitler didn't trust them. However, as the author notes \\"The political instrumentation of the Zeppelin had bound to occur for like all aspects of aviation, the Zeppelin fit in with the new regime's desire to demonstrate its interest in technological innovation.\\" Hugo Eckener, once considered running against Hitler in the 1932 election, was losing his battle with the Nazi While the Nazi cared little for Eckener it was only logical that they follow his philosophy and try to turn the airship into a profitable venture. However, the Zeppelin as a symbol of German honor, culture and technology came to an abrupt end in 1937 with the destruction of the Hindenburg.<br />The Hindenburg's replacement, Graf Zeppelin II, made some propaganda flights, but unable to obtain helium from the United States, the Zeppelin era ended on20 February 1940 when the Air Ministry ordered the destruction of the two airships, Graf Zeppelin and Graf Zeppelin II.<br />The author concludes the book noting, \\"Indeed, the Zeppelin offers an interesting case study of how society and technology play upon one another\\" adding \\"While Zeppelins served as nationalist icons from 1908 onward, under the Nazis their political use became blatant and conspicuous. The airship offered a seemingly perfect propaganda piece for the national Socialist leaders, appearing at Nazi rallies, whipping up nationalist enthusiasm before the arrival of Hitler.\\"<br />This book is not your typical Zeppelin book that mostly dwells on the Hindenburg crash; rather it is a well-researched study of the interaction of technology and culture in a society. Finally, the \\"Essay on Sources and Methods\\" at the end of the book is very useful for the serious reader and merits close attention.	2003-10-15

In addition, law schools began to encourage lawyers to be entrepreneurs. Under this philosophy \\"...more than half of the nation's GNP would be routed through lawyer's offices. A lot would stay there.\\"<br />The author states that trial lawyers are usurping the power vested by the Constitution in an elected Congress. He develops his thesis by reviewing the methods used by trial lawyers in litigation involving the tobacco settlement, gun control, silicone breast implants, asbestos, etc. In addition, the book discusses how some states, referred to as \\"The Jackpot Belt,\\" are overly supportive of class action lawsuits and trial lawyers. In fact one southern town has class action lawsuits as its major industry and their wealthy trial lawyers are its elite citizens.<br />The text notes that the class action/mass tort litigation business is basically unregulated with the Washington Post newspaper lamenting that \\"we now have government by and for lawyers,\\" who had \\"hijacked the public policy for private enrichment\\" in a \\"daring inventive and brazen\\" campaign. The author notes that all pretense of legitimacy was tossed aside when the trial bar referred to itself as a Fourth Branch of government, and notes that \\"...we allowed the Fourth Branch to seize the historic powers of government while escaping the long-evolved constraints on the abuse of that power.\\"<br />While lamenting the rule of lawyers, the author notes that rise of the class action lawyers has been facilitated by the failure of congress and legislators to address critical social issues. However, the book ends stating \\"The new rule of lawyers brings us many evils, but perhaps the greatest is theway it robs the American people of the right to find its own future and pursue its own destiny.\\"<br />The reader may not agree with the author's approach or all of his conclusions. Nevertheless, this book is worth taking time to read.	2003-09-16
US	51075913	R1N3M2FJ09CQ57	0961163402	498456299	Twelve Seconds to the Moon: A Story of the Wright Brothers	Books	5	3	5	N	N	WRIGHT-ON	This book will interest the serious aviation historian and the \\"airplane buff.\\" First published in 1978 by the Dayton newspaper The Journal Herald, in 1985 the United States Air Force Museum Foundation, Inc. published this revised edition. The text contains many direct quotations. For example, in 1899 when Wilbur wrote the Smithsonian Institution for documents/references on flight, this book presents Wilbur's letter as written.<br />Understanding the Wright brothers requires understanding their family. The text devotes the first fifteen pages to a discussion of the Wright family. The brothers became interested in flying after reading an 1894 magazine article describing the experiments of Otto Lilienthal. After extensive studying documents and gulls, the Wrights concluded that control was essential to flying and that \\"wing warping\\" was the key to the critical element, lateral control. They built a full-size man-carrying glider, which was first tested as a kite and then flown carrying a man. Because of favorable wind conditions, they chose Kitty Hawk North Carolina for their test site. The text provides an excellent account of their experiments from 1900 through 1902. When their 1901 glider failed to meet expectations, they discovered that Lilienthal's aeronautical tables, the glider's design basis, were incorrect. They built a wind tunnel and developed their own, correct, aeronautical tables. The text notes, \\"Their ingenious testing laid the foundation for all future aeronautical research.\\"<br />Following successful tests of their 1902 glider, the Wrights decided they were ready for powered flight. Unable to find a suitable gasoline engine for flight, they designed and built their own. Also, as Carl Taylor (their machinist/mechanic) wrote, \\"I think the hardest job Will and Orv had was the propellers. I don't believe they were given enough credit for that development.... They couldn't find any formula for what they needed. So they developed their own and this they didin the wind tunnel.\\" In 1903 they returned to Kitty Hawk. On December 17 at 10:35 a.m. Orville made the first successful man-carrying flight traveling 120 feet in twelve seconds. A total of four flights were made that day. The last flight by Wilbur was 852 feet in 59 seconds after which a wind gust wrecked the aeroplane. Newspapers gave scant coverage of these flights. The book notes that during their experimental tests, the Wrights produced five great inventions: (1) \\"wing warping\\", (2) the forward elevator-later moved to the rear, (3) the wind tunnel, (4) the moveable single vertical rudder, and (5) an effective aircraft propeller. Quite an accomplishment for a couple of bicycle mechanics. <br />In 1904 the brothers began a series of tests on a farm outside of Dayton. By the end of 1905, the Wrights were competent /experienced aviators. After 1905, the brothers did not fly again for almost three years. The text gives an interesting account of the Wrights' subsequent legal battles and their fight for recognition. In 1908, the government gave them a contract for an aeroplane; and Wilbur went to France where he amazed the Europeans with his flying demonstrations. Unfortunately, in September 1908, after successful Army pre- acceptance test flights, Orville crashed at Fort Myers killing his passenger Lieutenant Selfridge. Wide recognition finally came in 1909 when Wilbur made a flight from Governor's Island around the Statue of Liberty and later up the Hudson River to Grant's Tomb and back. The text narrates all of the above with many direct quotes from documents, letters, etc.<br />Wilbur died in 1912, and the narration turns to the legal battles and efforts to challenge the Wrights and discredit their accomplishments. Their challengers included telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, the Smithsonian, Glenn Curtiss and their old friend Octave Chanute. Dirty play was not beneath their opponents. On page 139 Orville Wright is quoted noting that following the Fort Myers crash \\"Later, when the guards were at dinner, one of the visitors (Alexander Graham Bell) took the parts of the machine out of its crate and measured each part. Later we found an aeroplane on the market duplicating the measurement of our own.\\" Even worse in 1914 the Smithsonian asked Glenn Curtiss to restore the Langley aerodrome and test fly it. The deceased Langley was a former Smithsonian Secretary and claimant of the first manned flight. The Curtiss flight was successful, and it was claimed that Langley not the Wrights were first in flight. Stating that the aerodrome was restored to its original configuration, the 1914 aerodrome was found to have had over thirty critical changes. The claim to having been first was discredited.<br />Due to Orville's inflexibility and the Smithsonian's refusal to give full credit to the Wrights, in 1925, to the shock of the Smithsonian, Orville stated he planned to give the original Wright aeroplane to the British Kensington Science Museum. In 1928, the 1903 Flyer was unveiled at Kensington. A new Smithsonian Secretary in 1942 reached an agreement with Orville. In 1943 Orville wrote Kensington asking that the aeroplane be returned at a time when transportation was safe. Orville died on January 30, 1948 before the 1903 original aeroplane returned. \\"On the forty-fifth anniversary of the 1903 flight the Wright brothers 1903 aeroplane was formerly presented to the Smithsonian Institution.\\"<br />The book ends noting \\"Twenty feet above the space module Columbia in the National Air and Space Museum\\" hangs \\"the very aeroplane in which Orville in 1903 made from the sands of Kitty Hawk the twelve-second flight that sixty-six years later enabled man to land on the Sea of Tranquility and to walk on the moon.\\"	2003-08-12

Then during the last quarter of the nineteenth century scientists and inventors began addressing the problems of designing and flying a heavier-than-air craft (i.e. an airplane). This book is the story of the Wright brothers and the invention of the airplane-in the Wrights time they were called aeroplanes.<br />To understand the Wright brothers it is necessary to understand the Wright family. Throughout the book, the text devotes several pages to the Wright family as related to the two famous brothers. Both Wilbur and Orville were highly intelligent self-made men. The author relates how, without advanced education or prior job experience, at age twenty-two, Wilbur successfully defended his father in a church dispute. The author states \\"He argued with a mastery of facts, logic, and wit that veteran lawyers would later envy.\\" Both brothers were proficient in math, physics and other sciences.<br />Their interest in flying began in 1894 when McClure's Magazine contained an article on the German flying pioneer Otto Lilienthal. The Wrights read everything they could on flying experiments and in May 1899 wrote the Smithsonian asking for any Smithsonian papers and a list of other works in print on flying. After countless hours observing pigeons birds in flight, they concluded that balance and control were the key to flying and conceived \\"wing warping\\" to provide lateral control. The author (James Tobin) narrates how in 1900 the Wrights began testing their theories by flying gliders as kites at Kitty Hawk North Carolina because the Kitty Hawk wind conditions met their experimental requirements. <br />Their gliders were biplanes. On October 20, 1900 \\"Will had never made a free flight in a glider. Yet on this day he chose to defy the world's only authorities on the basis of only his own calculations and preliminary experiments.\\" Will made several flights. Their 1901 glider was also successful and provided much design data and flight experience. The text notes that Wrights considered that control and careful accumulation of flying experience were the keys to success. They proceeded in a planned/organized manner. The author recounts their experiments with manned glider flights, relating how they found the data in Lilienthal's aeronautical tables did not correctly determine lift and drag. In order to obtain the required data, they built a wind tunnel and evaluated airfoil shapes developing the required data. <br />Following the success of their 1902 glider, in 1903 using their own data they built a larger glider adding propellers and a gasoline engine, both of their own design, making it an aeroplane. Without first testing the machine as a glider, at 10:35 am on December 17, 1903 Orville made a flight of 120 feet in 12 seconds, the first manned flight. Before the end of the day, Wilbur had flown 852 feet in 59 seconds. In 1904, the Wrights built a new and improved aeroplane and began flying in open field outside of Dayton. The author notes that once \\"Will chased a flock of birds in two circles of the field.\\" By the end of the 1905 flying season the Wrights had become competent aviators. Press coverage of the historic 1903 was scant and often inaccurate. While several invited people including reporters witnessed the 1904/1905 flights, press coverage was still limited. Broad patent protection was granted in 1906, and the Wrights temporarily stopped flying.<br />During this same period several competitors both domestic and foreign were working to be the first to conquer the air. The author does an excellent job summarizing the efforts of these competitors, which included Alexander Graham Bell and foremost, Smithsonian Secretary Samuel Langley. Langley made an unsuccessful attempt at manned flight on December 8th just nine days before the Wrights' successful December 17, 1903 flights. The Wrights and Langley had approached manned flight differently; the Wrights had been correct. Because of the Wrights' reticence, many refused to believe their success. The Army, who funded Langley by $ 50,000, showed little interest in the Wright aeroplane. In 1908 Wilbur Wright took a new aeroplane to France and starting in August began a series of spectacular flights establishing beyond doubt their right to being the first conquers of the air. Also in 1908 the Army became gave the Wright's a contract. The text narrates Orville's 1908 flights at Fort Myer, which after successful pre-acceptance flights resulted in a crash on September 17, 1908 that killed his passenger Lieutenant Thomas Selfridge.<br />The author gives an interesting account Wilbur's 1909 Hudson-Fulton Celebration flights around the Statue of Liberty and later up the Hudson River to Grant's Tomb and then back-down the river. After these flights, it was generally accepted that the Wright's had been the first to fly. Orville in the fall of 1911, when testing a new glider at Kitty Hawk, set a world's record for soaring-nine minutes and forty-five seconds-that stood for ten years. The text recounts the bitter competition that continued, especially from Glenn Curtiss. Certain Wright family members blamed Curtiss for Wilbur's premature death in 1912. <br />The book ends with an EPILOGUE concluding with the 1948 dedication of the original 1903 Wright Flyer at the Smithsonian.<br />This is an excellent well-written account of the invention of the airplane. The Wright brothers were much more than a couple of bicycle shop bumpkins; they were by any measure serious gifted scientists.	2003-08-01

The author, Richard Collier, has chosen the six weeks period from August 6 to September 15, 1940 for an account of the Battle of Britain \\"daylight air battles that were fought over the English Channel and across southern Britain; a short period that may have determined the western world fate.\\" This is the story of the pilots, aircrews, support personnel, and commanders of the RAF and Luftwaffe who fought for air supremacy while Germany was preparing to invade Britain. <br />First hand and eyewitness accounts supported by official documents provide the details for the text, which is fast-moving and very readable. The narrative moves chronologically from mid-August 1940 through the September 15. The Luftwaffe initially launched devastating attacks against British radar sites and RAF stations such as Biggin Hill and Manston with the intent to either destroy the RAF on the ground or in the air as RAF fighters defended the stations. This tactic created a serious problem for RAF Fighter Command as limited aircraft and pilots had to be dispersed to defend multiple locations. RAF pilots were under great stress as \\"The mounting losses now decreed that a pilot's expectation of life was no more than eighty-seven flying hours.\\" \\"One moment the pilots were sprawled on the dusty grass at dispersal, swapping stories, the next they were staring unbelieving at scores of German planes flying in perfect stepped-up formation.\\" By September pilot wastage was approaching 120 men a week and aircraft losses exceeded production.<br />Lacking is the usual Hollywood approach to air combat that opens with \\"There I was at 20,000 feet when I spotted the enemy.\\" Instead Colliers presents first hand and eyewitness accounts of the air battles, which are well presented and informative. For example, the author writes, \\"Then, in his last moment, feral instinct once more saved Red Tobin's life. In the second of closing in, something prompted him to make one last check, swinging the Spitfire violently to port, and as he swung back on the last weave of all he saw, almost dead astern, three yellow-nosed Messerschmitt 109s.\\" Humor is also included in the text: at Homefield, Kent the butler \\"did the rounds of the velvety lawn after each dog-fight, sweeping up spent machine-gun bullets as deftly as ever he brushed crumbs from a damask table cloth.\\" In another case when a RAF pilot made a wheels-up crash landing near an Elizabethan garden, \\"a country gentlemen of the old school stepped courteously forward to greet him\\" with a glass of brandy for his unexpected guest.<br />The text outlines critical command problems. The British commander Air Vice-Marshall Sir Hugh Dowding lacked trained pilots despite a two-week crash course for replacement pilots as losses outstripped the training unit's yield. From 1438 men available, by September 3 pilot strength had slumped to 840, \\"a casualty rate which assured the Germans victory in just three weeks.\\" When Germany shifted to massive bomber raids to force the RAF into a fight to extinction, Fighter Command could concentrate fighter defense in larger groups; however, Dowding still faced a shortage of pilots and aircraft.<br />In Germany Reichsmarschall Hermann Goring lacked Dowding's empathy for his aircrews. To the German pilots it seemed that the pressure was stepping up almost hourly and Major Adolf Galland (later Germany's leading fighter ace) stated, \\"Things can't go on much longer like this. You can count on your fingers when your turn will come.\\" Goring insisted on using the ME 110, which was ineffective as a bomber escort; but rejected arguments to increase production of the badly needed Messerschmitt 109 fighter. He further foolishly stated at the battle's midpoint that the RAF was down to just fifty Spitfires.<br />The book closes with an excellent outline of the critical air battle that took place on September 15, which the author calls the \\"greatest air battle of all time\\" On September 15, high above the German bombers,the leader of the Luftwaffe fighter escort sardonically broke radio silence with: \\"Here come those last fifty Spitfires.\\" The RAF entered the battle with no reserves. While Dowding was still 170 pilots under strength, the author notes that at \\"this eleventh hour a fierce elation had seized every man airborne. \\"Few pilots notched top scores; it was teamwork from first to last\\" and so numerous were the crippled bombers pilots couldn't miss. <br />A downed German fighter pilot paid tribute to the RAF stating to his escorting guard \\"Well done, Spitfire.\\" After the critical air battles of the past six weeks, by September 17, Hitler decided to postpone invading Britain indefinitely and give full priority to invading Russian. Ahead for the RAF lay long nights of bombing while the day battle was all but over. The brave efforts of \\"the Few\\" may well have determined the outcome of WWII in the west.<br />The book ends with a brief section of Facts About the Battle of Britain. <br />Overall it is well written account of a critical event in World War II.	2003-07-16

The author, Zachary Karabell, does an excellent job outlining the political challenges encountered in planning and constructing the canal noting \\"The states of Europe competed over it; the Ottoman Empire tried to prevent its construction; and later, the armies of the modern Middle East destroyed the cities along its banks.\\" The text observes, \\"The canal was not just a monumental act of engineering and organization. It was the culmination of ideals and ambitions, and a symbol of all that the culture of the 19th century held dear. It was a hundred-mile-long trench that signaled the triumph of science, the creativity of mankind, and the beginning of a wonderful future.\\"<br />Incredibly, in 1798 Napoleon Bonaparte when occupying Alexandria, Egypt investigated digging a canal connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The author narrates the many political differences over a proposed canal especially the opposition of Britain. In 1854, Ferdinand de Lesseps (out of a government job) adopted and promoted the dream of  building the Suez Canal but he was strongly opposed by a group of French socialist technocrats and the British government. The book notes \\"Most of Egypt was desert and had been ruled for centuries by Turkish lords.\\" In November 1854, the viceroy of Egypt, Said Pasha, who \\"...was intoxicated by the promise of an Egypt restored to prominence and no longer under the control of the Ottoman Empire...\\" in 1854 gave a written concession to Lesseps to build a canal updating the concession in 1856. Lesseps wanted to follow a direct route, but canal opponents used the route argument to delay or defeat the project. <br />The Suez Canal Company was to be a publicly held stock company. When the stock subscription was under subscribed in November 1858, Said Pasha had Egypt cover the shortfall. As of January 1859, a company existed and work began under an unrealistic schedule. Political problems and maneuvering continued until French Emperor Napoleon III ruled in favor of Lesseps on the latest challenges.<br />The Suez Canal was being built during a time of technological change when steam power was replacing muscle power. With a completion date of November 1869, at the end of 1867 less than half of the canal's excavation was finished. The solution was to mechanize with nearly three hundred special steam powered machines being build for canal work. When the last construction dike was broken on August 15, 1869, the seas flowed quietly and peacefully together putting to rest the age-old fears that something terrible would happen when the waters from the Mediterranean and Red Sea mingled. On November 16 about sixty ships left Port Said on the Mediterranean Sea, and the next day at Ismailia a festive carnival began as the first transit of the Suez Canal was completed. Ironically in 1875, Britain (the canal's greatest critic) purchased 44 percent of the Suez Canal Company's stock becoming the largest single stockholder; and by the beginning of the twentieth century, the Suez Canal had become the fulcrum of the British Empire.<br />The canals' dream that animated the rulers of Egypt and France, as well as the engineers and the shareholders, that the East and West would be joined, and the union of the two seas and the two worlds would allow the energies of mankind to flourish was never realized. In 1956 Egypt, under Colonel Gamal Nasser,nationalized the canal and during the ensuing 1956 war the canal was blocked with sunken ships. Today the canal still functions but pipelines have taken away a large portion of the canal's business. The Suez Canal remains \\"a testament to nineteenth-century will and ingenuity. But its legacy for Egypt is a different and sadder story.\\"<br />The book ends stating \\"Visionaries created the canal, but others actually built it.... The Suez Canal was the greatest feat of organization and engineering of its day, and it served,for a brief moment, as a symbol of all that was right in the world.... As a vision, it was beautiful and inspiring; as a reality, it has sometimes been a blessing, and usually not. In its prime, it offered, at best, power and wealth.<br />This is a very readable account and provides useful background on 21st century politics in the Middle East. A better map of the canal route would be helpful. My main criticism is that greater coverage of the engineering challenges/resolutions was not given as it was also an engineering marvel in its day.	2003-07-10

Lee and the Making of Southern Strategy, 1861-1862	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Lee and Davis Making Southern Strategy	Joseph Harsh, the author, analyzes Confederate war strategy from Fort Sumter through the Battle of Second Manassas stating that it was not true that the all the South wanted was \\"to be left alone.\\" Declaring independence did not guarantee independence, and the author states the South thus \\"pursued three closely related but distinct war aims: independence, territorial integrity and the union of all the slave states.\\"<br />The text notes that statistically the South could not win. To overcome the odds, the Confederacy needed to conserve its resources while inflicting unacceptable casualties on the North. The text explains the doctrines of the Swiss military theorist Jomini, the probable basis for Jefferson Davis's doctrine of the \\"offensive-defense.\\" Davis's doctrine provided a firm strategic framework within which Confederate generals in the field could work. By October 1861, pursuing the offensive-defense considerable progress toward achieving Confederate war aims was made; followed next by reversals of Southern fortunes resulting in part from the failure to continue the policies/strategies that yielded early successes.<br />On June 1, 1862 Robert E. Lee took command of the Army of Northern Virginia, when Joseph Johnson was wounded. The offensive-defensive policy was already in practice and was not initiated by Lee as some contend. By \\"late May 1862, the South had nearly lost the war. Lee knew that Jefferson Davis expected him to go on the offensive to save Richmond and to reclaim Virginia. Harsh also notes \\"Lee chose the offensive because he wanted to win the war, and he thought it offered the only chance. He believed the defensive was the sure path to defeat.\\" His first response was the Seven Days Battle, whose strategy/execution contained errors, but nevertheless relieved the pressure on Richmond.<br />The author gives an excellent account of the strategic/tactical problems during the Seven Days Campaign and the events leading to the Battle of Second Manassas. Richmond was a major railroad center, banking center, manufacturing center, milling center and its lost would have been serious. It was important that the city is not captured and that Virginia is reclaimed. After the Seven Days Campaign Lee lost the initiative and was in a strategic stalemate that didn't end until Union General McClellan's Army of the Potomac was ordered back to Washington thereby ending the threat to Richmond.<br />The text gives an excellent account of the development of Lee's field strategies before and throughout the Battle of Second Manassas. The author notes as the battle neared its climax  \\"Lee desperately wanted to finish the task at hand by destroying the army of.... Pope.\\" However a frontal assault was the only option; and Lee couldn't afford the losses a frontal assault would incur. Nonetheless the author notes following the Second Manassas \\"Through chance, risk and much bloodshed, he and the Army of Northern Virginia were cobbling together the series of rapid victories that might lead to Northern demoralization and Confederate independence.\\" The text ends with the Battle of Second Manassas and closes with six appendixes that discuss strategy questions.<br />While this an excellent work, my major criticism is an almost total lack of suitable maps. I read the chapters on the Battle of Second Manassas with a copy of Hennessy's book on Second Manassas at hand for its maps. While much can be gained from this book without prior study of the first eighteen months of the Civil War, prior reading of history about the period covered by this book will greatly aid the reader in comprehending Harsh's text.Richmond was a major railroad center, banking center, manufacturing center, milling center and its lost would have been serious.

The text notes, \\"Almost always, it was the Germans who at least indirectly invited the truce\\" shouting the words \\"You no shoot, we no shoot.\\" \\"The initiatives were at first rebuffed, but both sides wanted it, and a truce materialized\\" as up and down No Man's Land the two sides-even the French-were coming together with burial of corpses a \\"tacit precondition for fraternization.\\" In most areas the truce was from Christmas Eve lasting until midnight Christmas Day  with some areas extending the truce through December 26th. In other areas, bad weather discouraged resuming fighting on December 26th.<br />The text gives several examples of Christmas 1914 truces and fraternization. Officers up to the rank of colonel were involved but kept a low profile. Both Allied and German high commands were concerned about the implications of fraternization, and opposed the Christmas truce. However, the \\"fraternization, dangerously unwarlike from the headquarter perspective, seemed unstoppable.\\" The text recounts several stories about impromptu soccer games. One soldier wrote, \\"Everywhere you looked, the occupants of the trenches stood about talking to each other and even playing football.\\"<br />On page 122 the book states \\"although the truce seemed to end as it had begun-from the bottom up, with random acts of violence-the High commands on both sides were also demanding renewed war, and by orders and threats they made it happen\\", and the truce ended with a few stray bullets and shells as few in the trenches wished to return to the killing field.<br />While the truce is basically dismissed in official histories as a minor occurrence of no inconsequence, in the last Chapter, the author asks the question what would have happened if soldiers on both sides refused to resume fighting.  Several \\"What Ifs\\" are outlined and the author states, \\"Much of this speculation may be frivolous,\\" but notes it \\"hinges upon one of the twentieth century's most potentially significant events.\\"<br />The book states \\"...Christmas 1914 reopened imaginations to the unsettling truth that at each end of the rifle, men were indeed the same...\\" and ends noting \\"However much the momentary peace of 1914 evidenced the desire of the combatants to live in amity with one another it was doomed from the start by the realities beyond the trenches.\\"<br />This book is an interesting account of peace slipping through mankind's figures.	2003-05-10

It is a title deeply deserved on many accounts.\\" He had an intimate connection with all three administrations preceding his presidency being responsible for the framing and passage of the Bill of Rights.<br />The balance of the book, ten chapters, covers his presidency.  He became president under very difficult circumstances. Jefferson literally had given up governing the nation for four crucial months passing on a stalled executive to Madison who had no real executive experience before becoming president. Lacking leadership experience the author relates the many cabinet and personnel problems he experienced while his provincialism often allowed him to get suckered punched in foreign affairs. Contrary to common belief, the Congressional \\"War Hawks\\" of the West did not thrust the War of 1812 on him. Madison wanted the war.<br />The author gives a succinct account of Madison and the conduct of the war from the aborted attempt to conquer Canada to the bright performance of the American Navy. In 1814 when the war was shifting in America's favor, Washington was burned in what the author calls \\"a perfect study of what was wrong with Madison' conduct of the war...\\" Political basis for military appointments (a practice continued into the Civil War) and reliance on state militia rather than army professionals contributed significantly to the Washington debacle.<br />The text gives a brief account of the work of the American peace commission and the treaty ending the war, which the Senate approved on February 16, 1815. The author notes, \\"Not a single one of its announced war goals had been reached....\\", but notes that \\"During his last year in office, Madison rode the swell of popular nationalism....\\" During the war Madison was truer to the strictures of the Constitution than any subsequent war president \\"as if to prove that the Constitution did not have to be jettisoned in a crisis.\\"<br />Garry Wills answers the question of how could James Madison be so outstanding in certain aspects of his life and be overshadowed in others. He concludes this book writing \\"No man could do everything for the country-not even Washington. Madison did more than most, and did some things better than any. That is quite enough.\\"<br />The reader will find parallels in today's national politics with the political shenanigans of the Madison era.	2003-05-01

The text notes \\"Sadness verging on bitterness always colored Ernie Pyle's memories of his early years,\\" and relates that his adult personal life also was basically unhappy. In 1928 while working for the Washington Daily News, Pyle began writing an aviation column that ultimately was carried by all Scripps-Howard newspapers. Foreshadowing his WWII reporting style, Pyle' favorite subjects were the anonymous airmail pilots telling \\"tales of the pilot's feats of bravery and improvisation.\\"<br />From 1935 to 1942 he roamed the western hemisphere where he wrote a column on his wanderings for the News and developed into a consummate craftsman of short prose and as Tobin noted \\"...in the process created \\"Ernie Pyle.\\" Reflecting what would be his wartime style the author notes, \\"...he studied unknown people doing extraordinary things.\\" The text relates Pyle's activities as a war correspondence in Tunsia where he shared the dangers and discomforts of the infantrymen at the front, and developed a bond with the American infantryman where his \\"writing transcended propaganda; it was richer, more heartfelt.\\" At home Pyle's editors were delighted with the rapid growth of his popular column. After Tunisia, he followed the troops in the invasion of Sicily and later into Italy.<br />In Italy, he completed construction of his mythical hero, the long-suffering G.I. The text notes that the \\"inescapable force of Pyle's war writings is to establish an unwritten covenant between the soldier at the front and the civilian back home.\\" Tobin also notes \\"Soldiers could see an image of themselves that they liked in his heroic depiction of the war...The G.I. myth worked for them too.\\" However, as Pyle was becoming the \\"Number-One Correspondent\\" he became troubled because he had been \\"credited with having written the truth...He had told as much of what he saw as people could read without vomiting. It was the part that would make them vomit that bothered him...\\" <br />Pyle covered the Normandy landing in June 1944. In contrast to today's instant TV battlefront coverage, Pyle admitted to readers \\"Indeed it will be some time before we have a really clear picture of what has happened or what is happening at the moment.\\" Pyle followed the infantry into France. The book notes, \\"The hedgerow country of Normandy was a killing field such as Ernie had never seen, and as the weeks passed, the constant presence of `too much death' whittled down his will to persist.\\" Once again the G.I.'s affection for him had risen after they saw Pyle force himself to share their dangers, which sometime made him, scream in his sleep. Those with today's anti-French attitude would agree with Pyle when he wrote that in Paris he felt as \\"though I were living in a whorehouse-not physically but spiritually.\\"<br />Ernie Pyle returned to the United States in mid-September 1944. After a much needed rest, in January 1945 Pyle left for the Pacific Theatre. Here Pyle was in a different environment. He couldn't relate to the hot food and warm beds aboard Navy ships, the comfortable living conditions of airmen stationed on Pacific islands and the generally pleasant environment on Pacific islands. He wrote, \\"It was such a contrast to what I'd known for so long in Europe that I felt almost ashamed.... They're...safe and living like kings and don't know it.\\" Even when relaxing with an aunt's grandson, a B-29 pilot who tried to relate the real combat conditions in the Pacific, Ernie just didn't understand the Pacific Theatre.<br />With the Army's 77th Division, \\"He went ashore\\" on a small island north of Okinawa \\"on the 17th of April 1945, talked with infantrymen during the afternoon and spent the night near the beach in a Japanese ammunition-storage bunker.\\" The next morning he hitched a ride when at ten o'clock the jeep he was riding in came under Japanese machine gun fire. After jumping into a ditch with the jeep's other riders, Pyle raised his head and was killed instantly. Far from home, Ernie Pyle died among his beloved infantrymen.<br />In closing James Tobin writes \\"Ernie and his G.I.'s made America look good. The Common Man Triumphant, the warrior-with-a-heart-of-gold-this was the self-image America carried into the post-war era.\\"<br />While the technology of war reporting has changed greatly since WWII, the author is correct when he observes, \\"As a practitioner of the craft of journalism, Pyle was perhaps without peer. After him, no war correspondent could pretend to have gotten the real story without having moved extensively among the front-line soldiers who actually fought.\\"<br />The book ends with a nice touch, an Appendix that contains a potpourri of Pyle's articles.	2003-04-17
US	51075913	R1AEZPF5KXFLMZ	0684863049	450843795	Yanks : The Epic Story of the American Army in World War I	Books	4	6	8	N	N	General Pershing,The AEF and The Modern U.S. Army	The author notes that the United States entered WWI in 1917 with only 200,000 men in the Army. The U.S. Army had to be multiplied many times to be of any value in Europe, where the Allies had nearly four million men on the Western Front and the Germans about 2.5 million. Politics early became a factor in America's entry into WWI; French Marshall Joffre supported a separate American army in France while the British appealed for Americans to fill up combat depleted British units.<br />Major General Pershing was selected to command American forces in France, left for Europe with his staff in May 1917 and began the gargantuan task of organizing the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), covering a multitude of requirements, including arrival ports, rail transportation, communications, equipment, supplies and most important the training of American troops in modern warfare. The text notes that Pershing and his chief-of-staff Harbord in France \\"were inventing the General Staff in the modern sense....\\" <br />The text describes the development of the AEF noting the general staff organization Pershing created was derived from observations he made as an attaché to the Japanese army in Manchuria in 1905. American officers, assisted by British and French officers, trained AEF divisions in modern warfare. In their first combat, American troops performed well in October 1917 at Seicheprey. However, the French command made sure that the American troops participated strictly under French control.  Eisenhower outlines the political problems the AEF and Pershing faced throughout the war. The British continued to want the AEF to be replacements within their ranks while the French wanted American divisions to be under French command.<br />The book's emphasis is on the problems of command and organization. Unified command of British and French troops was not attained until March 1918 with Ferdinand Foch appointed Supreme Commander. Pershing believed the intent of the unified command was to maintain Allied units using American troops as replacements. However, Pershing with President Wilson's support, preserved the AEF as a separate command.   <br />The text outlines the AEF's battles, as American troops became a major factor in the war. The AEF performed well and the 3rd Division earned the nickname \\"The rock of the Marne.\\" In July 1918 Pershing organized the AEF 1st Army, with the 1st Army being assigned the task of reducing the St. Mihiel salient. After a second AEF Army was organized with Pershing in command of both armies, Pershing was on a level with his French and British counterparts. The Argonne became the critical battle for the AEF as the defeat of Germany became eminent while bloody combat continued. <br />President Wilson rejected Germany's first peace feeler refusing to deal with the Kaiser or speak for the Allies. With combat continuing, the book outlines the events that ultimately lead to an Armistice. Eisenhower writes that Pershing felt \\"There can be no conclusion to this war until Germany is brought to her knees.\\" The author observes \\"History would seem to have vindicated General Pershing in his protests against granting Germany an armistice....\\" However,  \\"The governments of France, Britain and Italy, aware of the feelings in their respective countries, would never condone continuing the fighting any longer than necessary.\\" Politics prevailed and the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918. With the war ended the AEF was demobilized.<br />The text observes, \\"The creation, training, supplying and employment of the AEF had been a remarkable feat. From a force of only 200,000 officers and men.... In 1917, American had raised an army of over four million, of whom half had crossed the Atlantic.\\" The book observes \\"Pershing's AEF was the first modern Army the United States ever fielded, and the Army of the Second World War was less different from the AEF than the AEF was from the Army that preceded it.\\"  The book further notes \\"Perhapseven more important in the development of a modern army was Pershing's creation of a vast and elaborate supply system that was called Services of Supply in 1917-1918 and Communications Zone (Com-Z) in 1944-1945.<br />The text relates that George Patton and the AEF developed modern tank warfare doctrine, and notes \\"The airplane was no longer a novelty; it made a real difference whether one side or the other enjoyed air supremacy in a given sector.\\" Also important, service in the AEF trained many future American WWII senior officers such as George C. Marshall, Douglas MacArthur and George Patton.<br />The author notes, \\"One question is still debated: how important was the AEF to winning of the First World War? It is generally agreed that the threat of the growing power of the AEF, projected into 1919, was critical in convincing the German high command that the war could not be won.\\" In conclusion, Eisenhower makes the interesting assertion \\"If the United States had not entered the war-or had elected not to send an expeditionary force abroad-there would never have been a Second World War, Germany would have won the first one.\\"<br />This book will appeal to those interested in 20th century history.	2003-03-14
US	51075913	RVKAE9OSL18KW	158648138X	14000679	Pipe Dreams: Greed, Ego, and the Death of Enron	Books	5	13	15	N	N	HOW TO FAIL IN BUSINESS WITHOUT REALLY TRYING	This is a very readable account. The text opens stating, \\"My premise throughout this book is that Enron's failure wasn't due to faulty accounting or poor regulation.... Rather it failed because key leaders at Enron lost their moral/ethical direction at the same time that the company was making multibillion-dollar bets on fatally flawed projects.\\" The author asks\\" Why did a seventy-six year old pipeline company with rock-solid cash flow and reliable earnings suddenly flame out in a maelstrom of accounting irregularities, fraud and skullduggery.\\"<br />After a brief three-chapter history of Enron, the author develops his thesis that \\"Enron failed because its leadership was morally, ethically and financially corrupt,\\" showing how deal-focused management took one of the most profitable companies in Houston into bankruptcy. The author, Robert Bryce, a Texas investigative journalist, interviewed over 200 individuals, and researched countless documents, including nineteen SEC filings for this book.<br />The text discusses the major players in the context of their work, their abilities, Houston society and their work-place relationships. Many former Enron people blamed Ken Lay stating \\".... he flat couldn't judge people and said he became blinded to other people's faults. One Executive said Lay 'never understood that the pipelines that are paid for and power and processing plants that are mostly paid for, were the way to make money.\\"<br />The harshest accounts concern Jeff Skilling and Andy Fastow. Skilling, who became president in 1997, was called by one executive\\" the smartest son of a bitch I've ever met.\\" However, \\"Skilling was not a manager, he was a deal maker. Exotic financing schemes and the deals that came with them excited Skilling.\\" The text notes, \\" When it came to strategy and starting businesses, Jeff Skilling was a genius. When it came to understanding the importance of cash, he was dumber than a box of hammers.\\"<br />Skilling conceived the idea of a Gas Bankwhere gas producers were \\"depositors\\" in an imaginary bank while gas consumers were the \\"borrowers.\\" The Gas Bank was a turning point for Enron and made money. However, Skilling felt that accrual accounting was inadequate and changed to mark-to-market accounting for gas trading. Revenue growth then became more important than cash, which eventually put Enron in a cash crisis, giving birth to off-balance-sheet accounts. Enron started down a slippery ethical slope and no one in authority seemed to care. <br />Bryce states CFO Andy Fastow was not suited for his job. He knew how to set up dozens of off-balance-sheet entities, but he didn't understand the company's overall finances. \\"Fastow's special-purpose entities became a fast-and-dirty way for Enron to manufacture additional revenues in a big hurry. Fastow's off-the-balance sheet entities gave Enron the ability to do deals quickly.\\"<br />The book notes that making deals was enormously profitable to the managers who conceived the deals because these managers were paid fabulous bonuses when the deals were signed, rather than when the project was successful. Frank Wing's Teeside power deal in Britain was \\"colossal blunder\\"; he was nevertheless handsomely rewarded. In like manner, Rebecca Mark initiated a power plant project in India where there was no need and where historically 30 percent or more of the plant's output would simply disappear. The project paid her big bonuses plus Enron pardoned loans to her, which they did for many top executives, in excess of $1.6 million. Using off-balance-sheet entities, Mark next formed Azurix putting Enron in the water utilities world market. Through poor planning and extravagant spending Azurix was soon in cash extremis. The author states \\".... there is no question that the enormous losses Enron took on Mark's projects accelerated the company's downfall.\\" <br />From 1990 through 1996, Enron had a competent/effective president, Rich Kinder. Kinder's obsessions were cash and cash flow and under Kinder's management Enron grew steadily. Unfortunately, Kinder repeated Ken Lay's mistakes by sleeping with Lay's secretary. Lay was worried what his secretary may reveal to Kinder, and informed Kinder he would not be made CEO. Kinder resigned. The author states \\"Giving Kinder his walking papers would prove to be the single worst decision Ken Lay made in his career.\\" Jeff Skilling replaced Kinder and Enron's fate was sealed.<br />While they experienced cash shortages, Enron ignored expense control. Besides uncontrolled operating expenses there were many costly non-operating expenses. Enron's air fleet was a much-abused extravagance. In 2000 alone, Ken Lay's personal usage of Enron airplanes was estimated at $334,179. Amazingly just eighteen months before bankruptcy, Andy Fastow was the driving force behind an art-buying binge for Enron; and when Enron was just weeks from bankruptcy, art buying was accelerating.<br />The text gives a good account of Enron's final dive into failure. Criticism was not tolerated from outside analysts or by internal sources. The Board of Directors did virtually nothing to solve the cash problem for their annual $87,000 a year in cash and stock options. By year 2000 Enron had granted over 93.5 million shares of stock. As disaster approached, Skilling, Fastow, Mark and other senior executives began bailing out by cashing their stock options. Most employees didn't have the information or opportunity to follow suit. Skilling resigned in August 2001 and Fastow left on leave of absence in October. <br />It was now up to Ken Lay to save the company. Unfortunately, Lay didn't know what to do about Enron's $18 billion in liabilities. One sources observed, \\"Lay didn't have a clue. He was like a deer in the headlights.\\" The only solution was a merger. The only merger candidate, Dynegy Inc., terminated talks because of \\"questions about Enron's cash position.\\" Next, Standard & Poors slashed Enron's credit rating to junk status. On December 2, 2001 Enron filed for bankruptcy. Still without a clue, \\"Ken Lay made sure to keep blaming someone else. Along with the bankruptcy papers, Enron filed a $10 billion lawsuit against Dynergy, claiming breach of contract.\\"<br />In conclusion, as one analyst stated, \\"Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered\\"; this best summarizes the results of Enron's greed and arrogance.	2003-02-22
US	51075913	RE2JLV6TG8YT7	0684849275	203897764	Grant	Books	4	3	4	N	N	The True Nature of Ulysses S. Grant	While this book reveals nothing new, Jean Edward Smith has authored an interesting, well written biography of U. S. Grant. Grant grew up in southern Ohio and at age seventeen his father said he was sending him to West Point. Reluctantly Grant went to West Point, and the text notes \\"Curiously, Grant hit it off best with Longstreet.\\" Longstreet was best man at Grant's wedding.<br />Grant went to war in Mexico; the war developed Grant's military professionalism greatly influencing his military thinking. When General Taylor appointed him quartermaster Grant was bitterly disappointed. However, this assignment was very beneficial as \\"it taught him the intricacies of military logistics logistics from the bottom up. For a man who would go on to command large armies, no training could have been more valuable.\\" When Grant returned after the war he got married and in 1852 was posted to California where problems developed. Lonely without his family he began to drink more than was good for him. Forced to resign, he returned home and where he failed as a real-estate speculator, freighter, and farmer.<br />With the outbreak of the Civil War, Grant was urged to return to the army. When \\"The state of Illinois desperately needed someone to sort out the chaos of mobilization and Grant filled the bill.\\" Then when General Fremont decided to go on the offensive and gain control of the Mississippi River, he appointed Grant to command the Union advance. Jean Smith states \\"Fremont's selection of Grant to command the Union advance is a benchmark in American history akin to FDR's selection of Eisenhower to lead the Normandy invasion.\\"  <br />The text's account of Grant's generalship in the West is succinct but adequate. \\"Vicksburg was Grant's great victory in the West\\" and Chattanooga confirmed his military ability. He then was called by President Lincoln to become general-in-chief of the Union army. The next notes that \\"The center piece of Grant's strategy was a combined offensive by Meade'sArmy of the Potomac against Lee, and Sherman's Division of the Mississippi against Johnston.\\" Grant established his headquarters with Meade's Army of the Potomac and the final campaign began in May 1864 with the Battle of the Wilderness where Grant was surprised by not anticipating the Confederate attack. Following the battle Grant correctly \\".... told his staff that while the battle might appear to have been a draw, we remain in possession of the field.\\" The text next gives a brief but good account of Army of the Potomac's campaign from the Wilderness, to crossing the Rapidan River and finally to Lee's surrender at Appomattox. <br />Chapter 13 \\"RECONSTRUCTION\\" and Chapter 14 \\"LET US HAVE PEACE\\" are interesting. The text observes \\"While Grant and Lee were taking the high road to reconciliation, the seeds of vengeance were sprouting in the North.\\" This phase of \\"Reconstruction labeled Presidential Reconstruction by historians, sought to bring the white South back into the Union at the expense of Negro rights.\\" Initially Grant was skeptical about enfranchising freedmen but later gave strong endorsement to black suffrage. The author states that Grant exhibited considerable diplomatic skill-a trait with which he is seldom credited-in pushing Reconstruction while bringing the southern states quickly back into the Union.<br />The sections on Grant's presidency are perhaps the best. He vigorously worked to make reconstruction succeed and fought hard to combat white supremacy atrocities in the south. When he took office in 1869 there were foreign policy issues, Cuba and the claims against Britain for the Confederate Navy's commerce raider CSS Alabama. Both issues were effectively addressed by Grant's administration. Jean Smith makes the interesting comparison that \\"Grant's role in American diplomacy was not unlike that of Eisenhower almost a century later. Both enjoyed enormous international statue and both provided firm yet understated guidance to United States foreign policy.\\"<br />Grant initiated efforts to address the grievances of American Indians. The text reveals \\"He sympathized with their plight, regretted their degradation, and was determined to shepherd them into full membership in American Society.\\" However, settlers moving west created problems as they overran Indian lands with Custer's last stand bringing Grant's Indian peace policy to the point of collapse.<br />The text notes, \\"The election of 1872 marked the high point of Grant's presidency.\\"<BR>His second term began with a much weaker cabinet and is erroneously often thought to represent his entire presidency. The author observes that Grant's loyalty to his appointees went beyond prudence and quotes Adam Badeau, Grant's military secretary, who said Grant \\"....was the most steadfast man imaginable when his friends were assailed....His political career was blighted by those he sustained,,,,\\"<br />After leaving the White House Grant and his wife toured the world where \\"People throughout the world opened their hearts and their doors to General Grant. He was received not as an ex-president but as the Hero of Appomattox. Upon returning home, some politicians wanted him to run for the presidency again, but he did not receive the nomination. His \\"daily exposure to the nation's titans of finance whetted Grant's acquisitive instincts\\", he was blindsided and squandered his limited assets. To earn money, Grant began writing his memoirs, which he completed shortly before his death in 1885.<br />While Grant is remembered as a great general, the author notes \\"As president of the United States, Grant had wound down government spending, reduced the federal deficit, broken the gold conspiracy on Black Friday, and weaned the country away from greenback inflation onto specie payment and a sound dollar.\\" This alone, was a notable achievement.<br />While nothing new is revealed, this is a well written, easy to read biography of Ulysses S. Grant.	2003-01-23
US	51075913	RMCNV090DI1B3	0515072958	608126516	Secret of Stalingrad	Books	4	11	11	N	N	A Dysfunctional Coalition	In the Preface, the opening paragraph summarizes the book stating  \\"This is about Stalingrad and how it was fought and why at the turning point in the struggle on the eastern front the United States and Great Britain invaded North Africa instead of the coast of France as almost everyone in those days expected.\\" The text notes that during WWII Moscow \\"was a secretive city in a secretive state waging a secretive war.\\" Even, the front line was unclear in the public's mind and few knew the names of Russian field commanders. Interestingly, an accurate/extensive civilian \\"grapevine\\" was developed which kept the public informed.<br />This book reviews the military and diplomatic events preceding the Battle of Stalingrad. The German High Command had misgivings about the eastern front in 1942, but Hitler assured them all was well as he planned to attack the Caucasus for their oil and food. Accurate intelligence was lacking for both combatants with the Germans tending to overrate their own forces while underestimating the enemy. Stalin, however, was better informed and did an excellent job of concealing his large number of reserves units. The text notes that even after the war that the Russians continued to conceal the role of these reserve units for reasons of military security or political necessity.<br />The diplomatic card game played by Stalin was intriguing. Stalin played his cards close to the chest, revealing nothing. Britain and the United States, however, failed to ask the right questions (in many cases asked no questions at all) that would have revealed the true military situation on the eastern front. Answers were needed before a second front could be opened. Stalin simply told his coalition partners nothing making effective coalition warfare impossible as mutual confidence was lacking. Stalin wanted a second front in Europe in 1943 and purposely led Roosevelt and Churchill to believe that Russia was in extremis. However, Churchill convinced Roosevelt to move to North Africa in 1942, and George Marshall thought this 1942 move would make it impossible to invade France in 1943. Thus a common integrated allied strategy was not developed.<br />The author narrates the tactics and moves of the German 6th Army as it thrust to the Volga River and the capture of Stalingrad. An angry Stalin annoyed that there would be no second front in Europe in 1942 and suspicious of his army's will to defend Stalingrad to death, issued on July 28 the terrifying directive to not yield any ground in Stalingrad. <br />The closer the Germans got to Stalingrad, the less room they had to maneuver and the farther they were from their base of supplies so that the Russian Army was able to initiate a counteroffensive to encircle and cutoff the German 6th Army. Stalin issued orders on September 12, 1942 to develop a powerful counteroffensive. The significance of 12 September passed unnoticed in Washington and London. Stalin's deception of his allies continued as the author notes on page 227 \\"On October 3, when Stalingrad was just about won, Stalin told Roosevelt and Churchill the military situation was getting `worse.\\" Hitler refused to allow General Paulus and the 6th Army to leave the Stalingrad pocket and on November 19th the Russian counterstroke in the Stalingrad direction began. By February 2, 1943 the German 6th Army ceased to exist and the Battle of Stalingrad ended. \\"The obliteration of the 6th Army, is a story of incomprehensive suffering that is made all the more appalling by the stunning fact it will never be known how many men died in the course of it.\\"<br />The author notes \\"After Stalingrad the uneasy relationship between East and West took a sharp turn for the worse from which it never fully recovered.\\" The continued mistrust prevented the development of a common strategy for the defeat of Nazi Germany. The author questions whether it was even clear to Roosevelt and Churchill that Stalingrad marked a turning point in the war on the eastern front. Had there been mutual trust and openness from the beginning, perhaps the war would have been shorten using an integrated allied military strategy. However, this may never become known as the text notes that much information still lies unobtainable in Moscow, London and Washington archives so that the full extend of the deception by all parties perhaps will never be revealed.<br />With the great wartime secrecy in Russia during the war, it is amazing how the author, as a New York newspaper correspondent, was able to move about in Russia. While this book is several years old now, it is well worth reading. Historians, politicians and diplomats may well learn from it valuable lessons regarding the critical need for mutual confidence and trust if military or political coalitions are to succeed. <br />My chief criticism is the lack of a good map or maps of the immediate battle area around Stalingrad. Also, the author's writing style is somewhat difficult.	2002-12-06
US	51075913	R3CP40HX10Y9KL	0805064583	32369664	Dr. Eckener's Dream Machine: The Great Zeppelin and the Dawn of Air Travel	Books	5	7	8	N	N	WHEN GIANTS ROAMED THE SKIES	Today with stealth fighters and bombers, Concorde supersonic airliners and jumbo-jets, few people realize that from 1928 to May 1937 German zeppelins dominated trans-Atlantic passenger air travel. In the book, Dr. Eckener's Dream Machine, Douglas Botting takes the reader back to the time of \\"zeppelin fever\\" and using the Graf Zeppelin as the narrative vehicle, tells the story of the German zeppelins and the life of Dr. Hugo Eckener. <br />The book opens with a account of the Graf Zeppelin's August 1929 flight from Friedrichshafen Germany to Berlin, the beginning of the Graf's 1929 round the world flight. Chapter 2 tells the story of Count Zeppelin and his invention of the rigid airship in 1900. Amazingly in 1910 zeppelins began carrying passengers on sightseeing flights over German cities. Chapter 3 narrates the zeppelin in WWI where great technical advances were made but the zeppelin had limited military utility. Virtually put out of business after WWI by the Inter-Allied Control Commission, the Zeppelin Company was revived in 1926 by supplying the LZ-126 (USS Los Angeles) to the United States as war reparations. Later funds were raised in Germany to build LZ-127, christened Graf Zeppelin on July 8, 1928.<br />The Graf Zeppelin was a passenger airship test-bed and Dr. Eckener wrote that the Graf \\". . .was to prove that passengers could now be carried across the Atlantic Ocean by air in speed and safety, and with all the comfort and pleasure which the modern traveler demands.\\" Botting narrates the dramatic first Atlantic crossing of the Graf in 1928.<br />The 1929 world flight was in reality two record flights, one originating at Lakehurst, New Jersey financed by Hearst Newspapers and the second starting at Friedrichshafen. Chapter five continues the world flight narrative noting it was not a world record that Eckener had in mind but considered it \\". . .a proving flight to demonstrated the zeppelin's potential for a worldwide passenger air service.\\" The book's account of the world flight is a fascinating well-written adventure story. The world flight of the Graf Zeppelin \\"provided incontroversible proof of the airship's capability as an intercontinental transport mode\\"; the author notes the world flight \\"had been brilliantly executed in both its planning and operations stages.\\" However, the passenger zeppelin used dangerous hydrogen and was vulnerable to weather masses. The author writes \\"The Graf got away with it on the world flight partly because it was a first-class aircraft, but above all because of the masterly expertise of the crew.\\"<br />The text notes \\"In the autumn of 1930, as the Graf Zeppelin was completing its first series of commercial flights to South America,\\" the Zeppelin Company began the design of LZ-129, later named the Hindenburg. In 1931 the Graf made an Artic exploration flight to the Soviet Union meeting a Russian icebreaker above the Artic Circle. The text notes that this was the last spectacular proving flight for the Graf.<br />In 1931 the Graf made three scheduled advertised flights carrying passengers and mail to South America, the first scheduled transatlantic air passenger flights in history. In 1932 scheduled passenger flights to South America in the Graf Zeppelin continued and plans were initiated to establish zeppelin travel throughout the world. <br />The author's account of this critical period in zeppelin history is excellent. In 1933 the Graf continued transatlantic passenger flights and the Nazi came to power. The 3rd Reich helped to fund construction of the Hindenburg, but at a price. The government took over zeppelin passenger operations and moved it to Frankfurt Germany with the Zeppelin Company left solely as a manufacturer. Having criticized the Nazi, Dr. Eckener was declared a non-person and could not command the Hindenburg when it was completed. The book tells how in 1936, Eckener's dream came true as the Hindenburg made ten scheduled round trips from Germany to America, plus sevenround trips to Brazil while the Graf made thirteen round trip flights to Rio. The financial results were impressive with Eckener noting that they were an \\"agreeable surprise.\\"<br />On May 3, 1937 the Hindenburg, LZ-129, left Frankfort for Lakehurst, N.J. under the command of Captain Max Pruss, Eckener still a Nazi non-person was not on board. Three days later at 7:25 P.M. EDT, while landing at Lakehurst, the Hindenburg exploded. The account of the Hindenburg catastrophe is excellent. Most interesting are several direct quotes from on-board passengers and crew. The total number of dead totaled thirty-six-thirteen passengers out of thirty-six on board and twenty-two of the sixty-one crewmembers plus one civilian ground crew. The book states that the Hindenburg disaster marked the first passenger fatalities in commercial zeppelin operations since their beginning in 1910, zeppelins having made twenty-three hundred flights carrying more than fifty thousand passengers with a blameless safety record. After May 1937, commercial zeppelin operations ceased. However, as one of the last commanders of passenger zeppelins noted, \\"It was not the catastrophe of Lakehurst which destroyed the Zeppelin, it was the war.\\" During WWII, the Zeppelin Company assembled V-2 rockets. <br />In less than ten years, the Graf Zeppelin had made 590 flights traveling 1,060,000 miles safely carrying 13,000 passengers; a record not exceeded by an airplane for many years. When the Hindenburg's successful passenger flights are added in, this was a remarkable accomplishment, as transatlantic airplane passenger flights didn't begin until 1939 with large flying boats making numerous enroute-refueling stops. Not until 1957, twenty years after the Hindenburg's nonstop passenger flights to North America, did scheduled direct nonstop service begin with DC-7s from New York to London.<br />This is a well-written history and those interested in aviation history will find it refreshing to read an account of German zeppelins where the book's primary focus is not the Hindenburg disaster.	2002-10-31
US	51075913	RMZ4DCIRUFQCD	0700608362	246811488	The Luftwaffe: Creating the Operational Air War, 1918-1940	Books	5	10	11	N	N	THE MAKING OF THE LUFTWAFFE	James S. Corum has written a scholarly study of German air power ideas and operational doctrine in a well-researched history of the German air power from 1918-1940. In addition, the text provides an understanding of the human dimension in the development of the Luftwaffe beyond the usual stories of Herman Goring and the Nazis.   <br />The author notes, \\"In the years immediately following World War I, it looked to the world as if Germany had been completely disarmed as an air power. On the surface, this was so. Yet, in the long-term view, the Allied powers failed miserably in their effort to disarm Germany.\\" While their air power was disarmed, the Germans could not be stopped from thinking and studying. The text narrates how \\"General Hans von Seeckt and his small group of airmen succeeded in keeping air power as a central aspect of warfare.\\" After WWI, a select group of German officers made a detailed analyzed of WWI army and air power experience. Foreign air power developments and doctrine were also studied with foreign articles and manuscripts on air power translated into German. <br />Corum notes \\"Although Germany was denied an air force, it was not denied civil aviation or aviation technology by the Versailles Treaty. This gave the Germans an inherent advantage in the air, for Germany in the interwar period was a world leader in aircraft design and technology.\\" <br />By 1925 German air power operational doctrine was well advanced so that aircrew training and aircraft developed was needed. Most interesting was the text's description of the formation of the \\"Shadow Luftwaffe.\\" In 1925, under a 1922 treaty with Russia, a German air base was built at Lipetsk, Russia. From 1929-1933, several hundred officers, NCOs, and civilian employees were there as students, instructors, ground staff and test pilots. Airmen at Lipetsk would test tactics and doctrine by dropping live bombs on simulated targets. Fifty modern fighter aircraft were smuggled in from the Fokker factory in Holland. The text notes that an advantage of the Shadow Luftwaffe was the close and effective cooperation between those who developed doctrine for the aerial war, those who developed and built weapons and prototypes and finally the actual producers of the weaponry. <br />When the Nazi party came to power on 30 January 1933 and rearmament openly began, the text notes, \\"a new group of air leaders came to the fore\\" and inheriting \\"a sound foundation and built on it.\\" The author states, \\"the years 1933-1936 were of foundation-building. Several major personalities dominated the Luftwaffe organization and played vital roles in creating new concepts of air power...\\"  <br />The text narrates the discussions of air power philosophy and doctrine.  By 1934 an effective operational doctrine for a small to medium-sized German air force was developed. Contrary to Post-WWII Allied historians, the Luftwaffe was not limited to being \\"merely a tactical air force geared to army support operations.\\" On page-139, the author states \\"Regaining control of the air by defeating the enemy air forces was the primary objective\\" and Lieutenant-General Wever, Luftwaffe chief of staff, stated \\"Only the nation with strong bomber forces at its disposal can expect decisive action by its air force.\\" <br />Lack of a German air force in the 1920s pushed \\"German military personnel and civilians to seriously consider how one might conduct a passive defense that would minimize the effect of a strategic bombing campaign...\\" As WWII Allied bomber crews would sadly learn, flak would \\"become the core of German homeland defense\\".  Effective flak artillery was developed with flak battalions placed under Luftwaffe command. Civil defense was also a part of air defense doctrine with civil defense drills being conducted as early as 1936. However, the core of the Luftwaffe's air defense doctrine remained an offensive air campaign in order that home defenses would not be put to the test.<br />The book's account of the Luftwaffe's 1936-1939 involvement in the Spanish Civil War is fascinating noting \\"For a relatively modest investment, the German high command reaped some substantial strategic gains from its involvement in Spain.\\" For example, they learned that even in circumstances of general air superiority bombers must be escorted by fighters; a lesson that the Eight Air Force learned at great cost in 1942-1943. Also in Spain, \\"Air power strategy, tactics and doctrine were tested and corrected so that when WWII began, the Luftwaffe was better prepared for war than any other major air force. Interestingly, while widely covered and reported in the press, France, Britain and America paid little attention to the lessons Germany was learning in Spain.<br />The book states in the early years, \\"Goring let the seasoned professionals do their job, while he provided an inexhaustible supply of fund.\\" However, in the late 1930s politics became prevalent resulting in some poor appointments such as Jeschonnek, 1939-1943 air chief of staff, who overemphasized the dive-bomber at the expense of developing the heavy bomber and strategic air warfare. Equally disastrous was the appointment of Ernest Udet chief of the Luftwaffe Technical Office and who was totally unqualified for his position.<br />Author Corum notes \\"Rather than being a weakness, the Luftwaffe's doctrine of war developed painstakingly during the interwar period was one of the strengths of the Wehrmacht.\\"  The text closes stating \\"Despite the failure to develop a naval air doctrine and the poor guidance of Hans Jeschonnek, the Germans were able to gain the aerial advantage over the Allied powers in the first years of the World War II not because they had overwhelming numbers of aircraft, but because their conception of a future air war and the training and equipment required for such a war was far more accurate than their opponents' air power vision.\\"<br />Students of military history will enjoy the text. However, today's militaryplanners should consider the basis lessons from how the Luftwaffe was developed 1918-1940.	2002-10-14
US	51075913	R3KX8ZOJRSFH8Y	0684844184	69350065	When Pride Still Mattered: A Life of Vince Lombardi	Books	5	6	6	N	N	THE EVOLUTION OF A CHAMPION	David Maraniss has written the story of a champion, Vince Lombardi, covering his life from birth in Brooklyn in 1913 to his untimely death in 1970. The book briefly describes his family background noting that his father with his father's brother owned their own business selling wholesale meat. Family, religion and sports shaped Lombardi's childhood. While sometimes inaccurately portrayed as a martinet, this is misleading, as he was a more complex person. The author traces Lombardi's development as he progressed from playing high school football, to college football at Fordham, to an assistant coach at Army, to finally becoming an outstanding NFL head coach. <br />  Many influenced Lombardi's career. On page 245 the author notes \\"The fundamental principles that he used in coaching-repetition, discipline, clarity, faith, subsuming individual ego to a larger good-were merely extensions of the religious ethic he had learned from the Jesuits.\\"  From Army coach Red Blake he learned how to organize a team and prepare it to play its best. <br />Interestingly, his first head-coaching job was as a high school basketball coach. He knew little about basketball but coached his team to a regional championship. He began his football-coaching career at St. Cecilia High School in North Jersey staying eight years and developing there many of the skills that later allowed him to stand apart form the coaching multitudes. The text narrates Lombardi's coaching career from St. Cecilia, to an assistant coach under Red Blake at Army, to his first pro-football coaching job in 1954 as offensive coach for the New York Giants. The author notes that with the Giants \\"Lombardi began to earn the respect of the pros.. .If he had to adjust, he would find the means; it was a talent that exhibited for the rest of his coaching career, though it often went unrecognized, overshadowed by his public image as the implacable leader who demanded that the world adapt to him.\\" The Giants offense scored 264 points in 1956, the most in the East, and the press began to recognize him. <br />In 1959 Lombardi went to Green Bay Packers as general manager and head coach. Here  \\"He would have no tolerance for the halfhearted, the defeatist, the loser. The goal was to be the New York Yankees of football. World champions, every day, year round. Admired everywhere.\\" The Packers ended their first season with Lombardi with a record of 7 and 5, the first Packer winning season in a dozen year; and Lombardi was named NFL coach of the year in an Associated Press poll of sportswriters and sportscasters. As the old saying goes \\"From this point on it was all history.\\"<br />The text continues the Lombardi story which is the birth and history of modern NFL football as the game emerged from it one conference to today's era of two conferences and the Super Bowl. Along with the story of Lombardi's coaching career and his outstanding record with the Packers which included two Super Bowl Championships, the author relates the fascinating stories of Packer greats such as Bart Starr, Paul Hornung, Ray Nitschke, Forrest Greg, Willie Wood, etc. Interwoven with the narration, the personality and philosophy of Vince Lombardi is given. It some paragraphs, the story is almost like a motivation lecture given by Lombardi and later by his son Vincent.<br />A very interesting chapter is a discussion of Lombardi's signature phrase \\"Winning isn't everything, it's the only thing.\\" Contrary to popular belief Lombardi did not originate the expression. \\"Red \\" Sanders (later UCLA football coach) coined the phrase in the mid-1930s.and the line was later used in a John Wayne movie. Perhaps Lombardi's preferred expression was \\"Run to win\\" which emphasized his expectation of maximum effort from all involved.<br />The book notes that in 1968 having chosen to be just general manager and no longer coach, Lombardi was miserable, was faced with a team going downhill and suffered from declining health. In 1969, he accepted a partowner and head coach position with the Washington Redskins. The text recounts Lombardi ending, in 1969, the Redskins twelve year losing streak with a 7-5-2 winning record while the Packers without Lombardi went into a decline that lasted for more than a quarter-century.<br />The story ends with a moving account of Lombardi's terminal illness and his death on September 3, 1970. The author closes the book noting \\"The remnants of Lombardi's world are fading, yet his legend only grows in memory: the rugged and noble face, commanding voice, flashing teeth, primordial passion, unmatched commitment.\\"<br />This is a book that both fan and non-fan alike will enjoy.	2002-10-03

Diana Preston, the author, has written a comprehensive account of the Lusitania tragedy, which was a harbinger of twentieth century barbarism that would produce millions of noncombatant casualties.<br />The book first briefly outlines the British, German and American political and military status and activity early in the 20th century followed by a short history of the development of the submarine which was \\"The Weapon of the Weaker (naval power) Nation.\\" In WWI America became a major arms supplier to Britain, and the book's review of British and German activities in America are intriguing. Germany considered sabotage as the best means to counter American arms shipments to Britain.<br />Effective 4 February 1915, Germany announced a campaign of unrestricted submarine warfare, which was condemned by both Britain and America. On 1 May 1915, the Lusitania's New York departure date, Germany published newspaper warnings to persons traveling on British or allied ships in the war zone; however, the text notes that \\"Together with an inherent confidence in the Lusitania's performance was a quiet belief that `they daren't sink her.\\" At sea, the author writes, \\"Despite some underlying unease, time ebbed pleasantly for most passengers on the Lusitania.\\" On 7 May off the Irish coast, at 2:10 P.M German submarine U-20 fired a single torpedo, which struck the Lusitania just aft of the bridge, and the Lusitania sank eighteen minutes later.<br />The author provides a graphic account of the horror of the torpedo strike, the abandoning of ship, the tragedies in the water and the grueling wait for rescue; over three hours passed before first rescue ship arrived with some ships arriving as much as seven hours after the sinking. Preston writes that passengers and crew respond was \\"In some cases they had most to fear from each other,\\" but adds, \\"many passengers and crew did do their best to help one another.\\" Ashore it was a \\"Sad and Horrible Task\\" as the survivors were treated and the gruesome task of identifying the dead took place as more bodies were found each day. <br />The book now begins a most interesting section on the activities that followed in Britain, Germany and America. The American Consul in Queenstown reported to his secretary of state his belief that \\"the Cunard people and the Admiralty each appear willing to shift responsibility to the other . . . .\\" The Germans while regretting the loss of life applauded the attack; anti-German rioting broke out in many British cities while in the \\"United States. . . the Lusitania would remain a live issue until her own entry into the war and beyond.\\" The British Government recognized the propaganda value of the sinking and was \\"anxious that no blame for it could be placed at their door.\\" The official inquires in both Britain and America ultimately ruled that it was a barbaric act by Germany. In the United States there were tales of espionage and conspiracy including a bomb in the US Capitol building and an attempted murder of J.P.Morgan Jr. who coordinated British munitions purchases. In Germany the civilian ministers came to regret the act while the military wanted resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare which didn't occur until 1917 then probably too late to change the final outcome.<br />Justifications for the ship being a legitimate target are reviewed including comments on the outdated Cruiser Rules, which insisted upon \\"stop and search\\" an impractical requirement for a submarine. The author notes \\"Despite all its foreknowledge, this time the Admiralty sent no specific warnings and instituted no special measures to protest the Lusitania;\\" however, there is no evidence that the Admiralty deliberately sent the ship in harms way. Statements of German prisoners, however, made clear that in German naval circles the view prevailed that the U-20 \\"had definitely been ordered to lie in wait with a view to torpedoing her.\\" <br />The text notes that there is much evidence of information tampering. Items are missing from both the Admiralty and Cunard files, while American records have their share of missing documents. There are strong suggestions that Germany altered the War Diary of submarine U-20 for propaganda purposes or to forestall any postwar war crimes trials. However, on page 393, the author correctly states \\"The truth was that no government, British, German or American, was entirely free of blame for the situation leading up to the attack. Nor in its wake, was any government hesitant to twist the facts, or use the disaster, to its own political ends.\\" <br />The wreck was located in 1935, but it wasn't until advanced diving technology in the 1960s that meaningful exploration of the wreck began. These dives supplied much information but did not answer why the ship sank in only eighteen minutes, nor did the dives provide definite answers to the source of second or further explosions after the torpedo strike. Appendix B provides a technical review of the sinking which the author commissioned a consulting engineer to perform. This review notes that \\"Regardless of whether a second explosion occurred, the catastrophic level of hull damage was clearly the principal cause of the rapid sinking of the Lusitania. Regarding a possible second explosion the review notes \\"However caused, steam-line are easily the most likely cause of the second explosion. Captain Turner (Lusitania captain) certainly believed one occurred.\\"<br />In conclusion, the text notes that unrestricted submarine warfare heralded a time when the best-available technology would be unleashed without warning to noncombatants. The new barbarism of total war had begun.	2002-08-29
US	51075913	R36H7LGRU5O3MP	0380977524	912398025	A Scythe of Fire: A Civil War Story of the Eighth Georgia Infantry Regiment	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Confederate Infantrymen's Story-The Eight of Georgia	This is the story of the officers and men of the Eighth Georgia Infantry Regiment. The book opens with an interesting account of how the volunteer infantry companies comprising the Eighth were formed and concludes with Lee's surrender at Appomattox. Optimism was unlimited, and many volunteers were concerned that the war would end before they got in the \\"fray.\\" They were convinced that they were invincible. When orders were received to report to Richmond, as they traveled north they were met by cheering crowds along the way. In Richmond the Georgia Eighth Infantry Regiment was organized from ten Georgia volunteer infantry companies and assigned to the command of General Joseph Johnston.<br />Much of the text is based on information from diaries, journals, letters home and hometown newspapers. This makes for a very personal and readable account. Their baptism under fire came at the First Battle of Manassas when they faced cannon fire followed by a rifle engagement in nearby piney woods. At the First Battle of Manassas the Eighth suffered 208 casualties, 11% of the total Confederate losses. However, morale remained high and for those who missed the engagement due to illness the text notes that \\" . . .their worst fear was that the war would end . . .and they would go home never having seen the face of battle.\\" The book narrates the Georgia Eighth's campaigns from First Manassas to surrender at Appomattox with the Eighth participating in most major engagements. The book observes that \\"As usual, the men in the ranks paid the price,\\" but inspite of heavy causalities morale remained high with the text noting \\"They would go, all right, when ordered, not from any eagerness for the fight, but rather from \\"deep and stern convictions of duty.\\" Furthermore, they found support in experiencing the \\"decided change in the religious tone of the army . . .\\" <br />Robert E. Lee replaced Joe Johnston on June 1, 1862, and the text states \\"After three months of following Lee, the men had already gained a sublime confidence that they could not fail where he led.\\" However, following Gettysburg \\". . the campaign had seared its mark in the hearts and minds of the soldiers. They had thought victory close, within their grasp. They had given their supreme effort, and it had not been enough.\\" Nevertheless, almost two years later the men of the Eighth still cheered Robert E. Lee when he rode past in his full dress uniform on his way to surrender to Grant.<br />Being the story of Confederate Infantrymen, there is limited analysis of strategies, tactics, commanders and command problems, concentrating instead on the men and their ordeals. However, the few comments made are interesting such as on page 60 which observes that \\"Like many of the plans Beauregard would make during the war, this one was overelaborate and unrealistic . . .Mistakes and misunderstandings were bound to occur and Beauregard's grandiose plan tended to maximize them.\\" On page 246,  the text correctly comments on Longstreet's July 2nd inaction with McLaw's right brigade in support of the Eighth at Gettysburg at Rose woods noting \\"Longstreet was with McLaw during this period and apparently delayed the latter's attack for reasons that seemed sufficient to him but that no one else has ever understood.\\"<br />The book contains few errors.  However, page 110 erroneously states that one day the Eighth \\"observed the ascension of one of the hot-air balloons that the Federals were using to observe Rebel positions.\\" The balloon that the Eighth Georgia saw was a balloon inflated with hydrogen gas flown by Professor Lowe and was not a \\"hot-air\\" balloon. Hot-air balloons were not used during the Civil War! In fact, hot-air balloons were rarely, if ever, used for military purposes. The flight observed probably was the June 18, 1861 demonstration flight by Professor Lowe in a balloon he owned as the Union army owned no balloons until late August. (1)<br />This is a Civil War book that narrates the story of Confederate infantrymen who bravely fought and died long after their cause was lost because they felt it was their \\"duty\\". After surrender \\"The men of the Eighth, just over hundred of them,\\" [full regimental complement was 1000 men] \\" made their way back to the their homes in two and threes, or alone, by whatever means of transportation they could manage.\\" They had fought bravely for their dream of the Old South.<br />(1) Lighter -Than - Air Flight (1965 Franklin Watts Inc.)edited by Lt.

US	51075913	R1F5EILIUPQ65W	0151005648	68905596	An Honorable Defeat: The Last Days of the Confederate Government	Books	5	6	7	N	N	A Noble Finale	William Davis has written a comprehensive account of the last days of the Confederate Government. Chapter 1 reviews President Jefferson Davis's cabinet and briefly outlines the career of John Breckinridge (appointed Secretary of War in January 1865 and a key player in the final days of the Confederacy).<br />Failing to break to break through Grant's encircling line at Petersburg, on April 2nd Robert E. Lee notified Davis and Breckinridge, that the government should immediately leave Richmond as he only could hold his position until that night. That evening two trains took Davis and his cabinet to Danville, Virginia with Breckinridge following later by horseback leading a train of wagons. While Breckinridge was traveling to Danville, Lee surrendered his army.<br />The author narrates the escape of the Confederate Government as it traveled to Danville, Greensboro, and then Charlotte. The text gives an interesting account of Breckinridge in Charlotte traveling to join General Joe Johnston in negotiations with Sherman for surrender terms. Breckinridge largely framed the Confederacy's proposal. Sherman's generous terms (which Davis didn't like) were soon rejected in Washington. Johnston now had no choice except to surrender. To escape capture, Davis's government traveled to Abbeville and then to Washington, Georgia. <br />From Danville on, as the government moved south citizens began breaking into and looting the remaining military stores. The author notes \\"Tragically after four years of heroic sacrifice, what remained of the Confederacy had to be protected from its own people,\\" At Washington, Georgia the government was essentially dissolved. Midshipmen R.H. Fleming's lamented \\"I fear all is lost but our honor.\\" <br />While the book is an account of the final weeks of the Confederacy, the underlying theme is Breckinridge's efforts to achieve an honorable defeat and not have the war end as a \\"farce.\\" The author notes that by 1865 it was no longer a question of would the Confederacy fall, but rather \\"how\\" it should fall. The author states perceptive men wished to avoid the retaliation, revenge, and oppression such as occurred in Mexico and South America following defeat in an internal struggle. Early in 1865, faced with certain defeat, Breckinridge, Lee and Assistant Secretary of War John Campbell wished to use the presence of Confederate armies in the field to bargain for better terms rather than be defeated and forced into \\"subjugation when they no longer had anything, even surrender, with which to bargain.\\" However, Jefferson Davis wanted no part of any plan to end the war short of independence. After the surrender of Lee's and Johnston's armies, the author notes \\"it was clear that Jefferson Davis was not about to abandon his dreams for independence, but merely to change their shape \\". He wished to continue the war as a partisan conflict and to cross the Mississippi River and continue the war from Texas.<br />Now Breckinridge wanted get Jefferson Davis safely out of the country to save the South from the humiliation of Davis's capture, conviction and possible execution. However, after leaving Washington, Jefferson Davis was captured the next morning outside of Irwinville. Breckinridge and a cavalry unit, which were trying to decoy Union cavalry away from Davis, escaped capture. The author next gives a graphic account of the escape to Cuba of Breckinridge and then Benjamin; either escape would make a fascinating adventure movie.<br />The final chapter, Aftermath, recounts the post Civil War history of Davis and the key members of his government. Benjamin practiced law in England and never returned. Other cabinet members stayed or returned to the United States, but afterwards they rarely saw each other. Regarding Breckinridge, the text continues \\"From February 1865 onward he saw that the one victory he could win was for the memory and example that the Confederate epic might provide for later generations . . . In preserving its archives for future historians, he helped to guarantee that they would be remembered.\\" The book closes noting that Breckinridge's story was a part of the \\"magnificent epic\\" and \\" he refused to taint it with farce . . .in the fight for moderation and reconciliation over bitterness and recrimination in the years that were to follow . . .\\" The author correctly states that \\" the real winner was not a man but America.\\"<br />My only criticism is that text lacks sufficient dates accompanying the narrative. On occasion, I had to consult other sources for the dates of critical events. However, those interested in the final days of the Confederate government will find this an excellent work.	2002-07-16
US	51075913	R105RGRSW9IDWW	1893554341	402951347	On Two Wings: Humble Faith and Common Sense at the American Founding	Books	4	52	56	N	N	Faith of Our Founding Fathers	Michael Novak has written a profusely documented and succinct analysis of the influence of religion on the form and the founding of the United States government. The author writes, \\"On two wings the American eagle rose into the sky. On plain reason and humble faith.\\" Discerning that American historical scholarship has greatly neglected the study of religion's influence on the form and character of our nation, Novak proceeds to answer the question \\"But how did the founders think of faith?\\" At the time of the Revolution, religion was important in American culture; the text states \\"During the years 1770-1776, the fires of revolution were lit by Protestant divines. . .\\" and continues \\"The very form of the Declaration was that of a traditional American prayer. . .\\" The author notes that the founders mentioned that faith provided at least seven contributions to the nation's founding which reason did not supply, and then he discusses each contribution.<br />George Washington was deeply religious. The text observes that \\"Washington does not call religion `optional'. The word he uses is `indispensable.\\" As Commander of the Continental Army he \\"gave orders that each day begin with formal prayer, to be led by the officers of each unit.\\" I'd hate to guess the outcome if the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff tried that one today. The text states that \\"The founders did not think the constitutional government they were erecting could survive without Hebrew-Christian faith.\\" and continues on page 129 \\"Virtually all the signers of the Declaration and Constitution were churchgoing men.\\"<br />Chapter Five is titled \\"TEN QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FOUNDING\\". The author answers and discusses ten critical questions. Question four asks, \\"When did things go wrong?\\" On page 112 Novak notes \\". the traditional alliance of religion and liberty in the United States came under assault after World War II from the rejection of Judaism and Christianity by many secular liberals in the academy, the lawand journalism . . . A determined effort was made to banish religion from American public life. Beginning about 1948, one Supreme Court case after another turned the judiciary (and the law schools) into aggressive enemies of religion in public life\\" <br />Novak continues \\"One reason the drive to secularize public life through the courts succeeded so quickly after 1945 may have been that for some decades the historians and political philosophers had already been dismissive of the powerful religious forces that had propelled the founding. They preferred a strictly agnostic view of the philosophy of natural rights.\\" However, on page 114, Novak asserts that \\"The purpose of the founders was far removed from wishing to ban religion from public life altogether; it was almost the opposite.\\"<br />There were founding fathers other than Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison. An excellent and very useful Appendix discusses several almost forgotten founders such as George Mason, Rufus King, Benjamin Rush, James Wilson. Alexander Hamilton, etc. and to a degree John Adams has been forgotten. On page 147, the text declares  that \\"Jefferson supplied the words of the Declaration, but Adams begat the deed.\\" The book, rightly, gives much credit to John Adams for his faith-based leadership and contributions in stressing justice and freedom for all.<br />Today with the media's influence plus countless court decisions and lawsuits concerning religion and the nation, it is difficult to realize that religion had any influence on the founding of the United States. However, some readers may be surprised to read that \\"In his days as president, the largest church service in the United States took place every Sunday in the Capitol Building and Thomas Jefferson thought it his duty to attend.\\" The text states that while Jefferson didn't \\"believe a word in it\\", \\" he strenuously affirmed that \\"the Christian religion is necessary for a republic.\\" Novak further recalls that \\". . . on a day of greatcrisis at the Constitutional Convention, when the two sides almost walked out on each other, it was Franklin - the supposed Deist - who moved that the Convention stop for a day of prayer to Divine Providence, for guidance through the impasse.\\" <br />The author notes \\". experience shows that republics need virtue, and that virtue needs religion. . .\\" and closes the book stating \\"That it has historically been the habit of republics to sink into moral decay - that, too - was a constant theme of the founders.\\" While the influence of religion on public life today may be limited or nonexistent, Michael Novak's book clearly documents and illustrates that religion had a great influence on the founding of the United States. <br />For those interested in the Declaration, the Constitution and the forming of the nation, this book is a must read.	2002-06-06
US	51075913	RJJPCQAHA0PU1	0679455175	344485885	Not War but Murder: Cold Harbor 1864	Books	5	13	14	N	N	COLD HARBOR - A FAILURE IN COMMAND	The text's opens stating \\"From June 3, 1864 to this day, those who know anything about the American Civil War, the name Cold Harbor has been a synonym for mindless slaughter.\\" The Prologue continues \\"Never did generals so blatantly place concern for their own reputation above mercy for their soldiers dying in the sun.\\" <br />The author, Ernest Furgurson, first reviews Grant's 1864 spring campaign from the Battle of the Wilderness to Cold Harbor. Throughout the campaign Grant continued to insist that he would beat Lee if only the Confederates would come out and fight an open battle where his numerical superiority would prevail. The Confederates refused to cooperate and developed entrenched positions leading Union General Meade to remark \\"In every instance we have attacked the enemy in an entrenched position we have failed.\\"<br />The text then provides an excellent account of the Cold Harbor campaign emphasizing  the climatic battle on June 3, 1864 when the Union forces attacked the well-entrenched Confederate lines. The climatic battle lasted less than an hour (extra time is disputed) with the Union suffering sever losses to comparatively light Confederate casualties. Confederate General Evander Law later wrote \\"It was not war; it was murder.\\"The lines stabilized, then sniper and mortar action continued for several days while the dead, dying and wounded lay unattended between the lines in no man's land. Finally, four-one-half days later, Lee and Grant arranged a truce when the dead and wounded were attended to.<br />Unlike the June 3rd attack, in a brilliantly planned and executed move, Grant's army left Cold Harbor during the night of June 12 with Grant's entourage arriving at the James River on June 14. Some say Lee was fooled by Grant's move across the James, but the author notes \\" . . . messages prove, Lee was not fooled by what Grant did. But beyond doubt, he was surprised by the secrecy, speed and efficiency with which Grant did it.\\" <br />There were few lightmoments at Cold Harbor; however, the texts tells of two opposing soldiers trapped between the lines \\"in the same hole who played cards until dark, when the Confederate claimed the Yankee loser as his prisoner.\\" Also, the book records that on Thursday, June 9  \\"The Rebs and our men got tired shooting and stopped without any arrangements between them . . . Men left their guns in the pits and met as friends  . . .  and were laying down on the works\\"-until the Union officer of the day ordered both sides back to their lines. \\"When they were back in their holes, they hollered to one another, `Watch out, Yanks I'm going to shoot,' and `Take care there, Johnnie, your head's in the way of my bullet.\\" <br />Regarding Grant's defeat at Cold Harbor, the text states \\"Grant badly misunderstood the enemy, from Robert E. Lee down to the leanest Alabama rifleman.\\" When Grant reported, \\"A battle with [the Rebels] outside of intrenchments cannot be had,' he considered that apparent fact to be proof of dwindling Southern morale. He had not learned the lessons of May as well as the privates in his own front ranks. \\" In addition the author writes \\"To attack such a formidable defense `all long the line,' without detailed reconnaissance, without specific objectives, and without a follow-up plan, was an act of colossal misjudgment. By the time Grant called off the attack, that was clear to every general and every private. They understood what had happened, and after belatedly inspecting the field, the generals understood now.\\"<BR> <br />The author discusses command problems. Regarding the strained Meade/Grant relationship he writes, \\"With two generals in command, no one properly managed the assault at Cold Harbor. There Grant suffered his worst defeat and Lee won his last great victory, and what happened there determined what happened across the James.\\" The Army of the Potomac lost about seven thousand men in the ill-fated June 3 attack with Lee losing less than fifteen hundred. Union armymorale slumped even lower after Cold Harbor and The Army of the Potomac developed a reluctance to charge enemy breastworks. After the Union army first crossed the James River, they held back when they could have easily overrun the puny Confederate Petersburg force.<br />Finally, the book gives some colorful insights to the role of the press during the spring campaign. One Union officer wrote \\"The reporters who make public opinion are the scum of creation and there is not one of them who any gentlemen would associate with.\\"<br />While Grant, perhaps recklessly, lost heavily at Cold Harbor, the author notes that Charles Dana (Union War Department Observer) correctly wrote \\"The outlook warranted the effort.\\" Breaking Lee's lines would have meant \\"his destruction and the collapse of the rebellion.\\" And if Grant had won, who would have thought of the losses?\\"<br />For the Confederates after Cold Harbor, Capt. Charles Blackford's previous observation was still tragically true when he had noted \\"We are being conquered by the splendor of our own victories, and Grants accepts defeat with that consolation . . .\\"<BR> <BR>Most histories of the Grant's 1864 spring campaign devote only a page or two to Cold Harbor. This excellent and well-written book provides details of interest to any serious student of the Civil War.	2002-05-09
US	51075913	R33CRHH8JHLJE7	0394555090	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	5	17	20	N	N	A MAN FOR OUR ERA	Edmund Morris has written an excellently account of Theodore Roosevelt's presidency. Arguably, Theodore Rex Roosevelt was one of the greatest United States Presidents. The author notes that Ex-President Grover Cleveland declared \\"Roosevelt is the most perfect politician thus far seen in the Presidency.\\"  Many contemporary historians rank Theodore Roosevelt in the \\"Top Five\\" of U.S. Presidents. <br />The book opens with an account of Roosevelt receiving word of McKinley's assassination and closes with Taft's inauguration on March 4, 1909. The author does an excellent job narrating the challenges Roosevelt faced during his first term including handling of the anthracite coal strike and ending the Russian-Japanese War. The text describes how the President adroitly handled all challenges including domestic political problems and crises on Wall Street. Later, Roosevelt received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work to facilitate the 1905 Treaty of Portsmouth ending the Russian-Japanese War.<br />The book covers his second term equally well. Roosevelt, a Republican,won a second term by a sizable majority. He had strong public support and the text quotes H.G. Wells stating \\"Never did a President so reflect the quality of his time\\" A frustrated Democratic Senator Tillman shouted \\" . . . the Democratic party can always be relied on to make a damn fool of itself at the critical time\\". <br />His second term was also demanding; and having publicly announced he would not run for a third term, his legislative clout was weakened. Among his second term challenges were a situation involving black soldiers in Brownsville, Texas; and anti-immigrant riots in San Francisco involving Japanese immigrants.  The cooperation of the Japanese government was required but not immediately forthcoming. The author notes \\"Roosevelt confessed another fear . . . that of war with Japan. He did not think it would come soon, but he was sure it would one day.\\" - how true! One reason that he sent the Great White Fleet around the world was not only to impress Europe but also to show to Japan the U.S. strength in the West Pacific. It worked and Japan became cooperative on the immigrant problem.<br />While handling his many second term challenges, he initiated a Governors' Conference (attended by 350 persons) covering ninety-five aspects of conservation, preservation and planned exploitation. The discussion of his relationship, during his second term, with heir apparent, William Howard Taft is revealing. In most aspects, Taft was the antithesis of Roosevelt.<br />It is interesting to note that many issues Theodore Roosevelt faced in both terms are issues today. For example: in his first message to Congress, regarding a ban on all political violent immigrants Roosevelt wrote \\"They and those like them should be kept out of this country and if found here they should be promptly deported to the country whence they came; and far-reaching provisions should be made for the punishment of those who stay.\\" Shades of  11September 2001.<br />In conclusion, the author writes \\"Statue books and official histories would celebrate his administrative achievements: the Monroe Doctrine reaffirmed, the Old World banished from the New World, the great Canal being cut; peace established in the Far East; the Open Door swinging freely in Manchuria and Morocco; Cuba liberated (and returned to self-government...); the Philippines pacified; the Navy hugely strengthened, known literally around the world; the Army shorn of its old deadwood generals...; capital and labor balanced off, the lynch rate declining, the gospel of cleaner politics now actually gospel, and enough progressive principles established, or made part of the national debate, to keep legislative reformers busy for at lest ten years.\\" To this should be added that he created five national parks and established sixteen national monuments plus initiated twenty federal irrigation projects in fourteen states.   <br />The books concluding paragraph states that \\"...he left behind a folk consensus that he had been the most powerfully positive American leader since Abraham Lincoln.\\" <br />Edmond Morris' style make this is a very readable book. For example, referring to Roosevelt's previous call for legislation in the area of employer's liability the author writes \\"That call had been mainly propaganda, since the lame-duck Fifty-eighth Congress had soon after quacked its last...\\"<br />Whether you like or dislike with Theodore Roosevelt, this book is a must for all American government history \\"buffs.\\"	2002-04-25

The introduction notes that \\"....there are those who reserve as Appalachia only those areas of the Southern Appalachians that are `real mountains.\\" The author's definition is broader including \\"all of the provinces of the Southern Appalachian\\" and extends to western Pennsylvania.<br />The book is organized in three parts. Part 1, titled THE CONTEST FOR APPALACHIA, covers the period from the Indians through the American Revolution.  The author writes \\"The principal class who migrated to America after 1715 were mostly folk who shared a....desire for land to support their basically simple lives.\\" These migrants passed through the coastal area and settled in the backwoods where small acreages were cleared and became basically a predominately yeoman (farm) economy.  <br />Part 2, THE NEW NATION AND THE APPALACHIAN BACKWOODS, covers the period through the Civil War. While Appalachia supported the Revolution, they  had no representation at the constitutional debates of 1787-1789. \\"By 1800 quite a different European-derived society had developed along the Appalachian frontier\\" and the author notes that a \\"snug little rivalry\\" developed between the east and west sections of the eastern states. Appalachia supported the War of 1812 when loyalty soared in the Appalachian backwoods but divisive issues would soon appear.<br />The text notes \\"most small farmers in East Tennessee, northern Georgia, West Virginia and eastern Kentucky usually identified more strongly with the....Union.\\" These areas were often identified with the Radical Republican during Reconstruction.; however, by 1876 the ex-Confederates had again assumed control. The text briefly discusses the feuds of the era noting many were active \\"before the Civil War.\\"<br />The author notes that after the Civil War in the remoteness of mountain regions far from adequate transportation \\", a remarkable similar way of life developed in Appalachia's most isolatedsections\\" which resulted in increased isolation reinforcing a stereotype about a `strange and peculiar people.\\"<br />MODERN APPALACHIA, Part 3, narrates the period from Post-Reconstruction to the year 2000 covering the Industrial Revolution, the Depression, the War on Poverty, and finally the dawning of the Information Age. As the text notes \\"Appalachia has always been a complex area.\\" From \\"1865 to 1920, Appalachia was discovered\\" and defined \\"by literate America who were northern writers. The picture that emerged was often grossly inaccurate, based on stereotype and self-serving characteristics.\\" For example, \\"....the word hillbilly did not appear until 1900 when a New York Journal reporter defined such people as `free and untrammelled white' citizens living in the hills' with `no means to speak of, `who dresses as he can,'drinks whiskey, and fires off his revolver as fancy takes him.\\"<br />During the machine age the mineral exploitation of the area took place and in many areas of the Great Valley significant industrial developments followed the railroads with an area like the Kanawha Valley in West Virginia becoming what was called \\"the American Ruhr. \\"By 1900 all the coalfields in West Virginia....were in full production.\\" Lumbering also became an important Appalachian industry.<br />Tourism was another commercial activity that invaded the cultural traditional of Appalachian society, aided by the development of the National Forests of Appalachia and the emergence of The Great Smoky Mountain National Park.. However, the exploitation of  region's fossil fuels was the major industrial invasion.<br />The author states that Appalachia went from a plutocracy to the Welfare State and back again to the present governing by the rich and powerful. With the collapse of the country's market system during the Depression new life came into the yeoman system of self-sufficient agriculture. \\"Because of the great economic maladjustments in Appalachia's major industries....largenumbers of people were able to qualify for welfare benefits\\"....with the nations welfare system growing out of New Deal reform measurers. The War on Poverty, 1964 to 1968, resulted in 1965 of the formation of the Appalachian Regional Commission which remains active today benefiting the region. Regarding welfare reform, the author makes the interesting observation that \\"Even yet in Appalachia, it may be that the only reform that can succeed must be seen through the lens of yeomanry.\\"<br />The text notes \\"...the region's society is far more diversified than the traditional picture painted as a stable enclave of Anglo-Saxon, Scotch-Irish, and Germans.\\" The 1930s and WWII brought important changes to the Appalachian culture. During WWII, there was a mass migration of Appalachians north for employment. Also, there was the wartime industrial growth in Appalachian fossil fuel extraction and the development of the chemical industry in West Virginia. Unfortunately, the text notes \\"The regional picture in Appalachia since the 1980s has been generally gloomy.\\"<br />Chapter 13 discusses the Appalachian Mind noting that \\"....the area began to find its own scholarly voice soon after World War II\\" and states this scholarship betrays a strong anger against American corporate capitalism and \\"....attests to the kind of tragic picture that Appalachian history presents.\\"<br />The final chapter discusses the future of Appalachia noting \\"As coal and agriculture,...., move into further decline, the essentially insatiable industries of education, health services, recreation, and tourism will provide the major job opportunities in the future.\\" Regarding the future, the text concludes \\" There is, and in fact has always been, a place for a viable, yeomanesque-style of life that is attractive to those unwilling or unable to join the mainstream's affluence.\\" Shades of today's politician's statements about \\"the family farm.\\"<br />The Source listing for this book is excellent. Instead of a long alphabetical and/or type listing of sources,  sources are listed separately for each chapter so that the reader can determine the author's sources plus read in further depth if desired.<br />The only technical error I noted is on page 200 where the author stated that the nuclear fuel for the atomic bombs was processed \\"At its vast Centrifugal Plant, Oak Ridge....\\" The fuel for these bombs was processed at the Oak Gaseous Diffusion Plant NOT at a Centrifugal Plant. An Oak Ridge Centrifugal test loop wasn't built until the 1970s	2002-04-03

The accomplishments of the Georgia defenders have been overlooked by historians who have, in turn, underestimated the significance of their actions on the outcome of the action that day.\\" For example, Russell Wiegley wrote \\"At the end of the day, the final Federal charge, across the Antietam near the right of the Confederate position over the Rohrbach Bridge--hereafter Burnside's Bridge--and up the adjacent hills, missed turning Lee's right and cutting his road to the Potomac only because Powell Hill and the Light Division arrived from Harpers Ferry at the last desperate moment.\\" (1) Other historians such as Emory Thomas have written similar comments.(2)<br />The author provides an excellent background review of the commanders and Georgia soldiers. Several officers had attended military colleges plus had experience in the Mexican and the Indian Wars. Several units, such as the 2nd Georgia, had a nycleus of soldiers from militia units such as the Columbus Guards of Muscogee County.<br />This well researched work is not a gneral account of the Antietam Battle, but concentrates on the fighting in the Rohrbridge sector; thus the reader is not distracted by the critical events taking place on General Lee's left or center. Union General George McClellan ordered General Burnside's IX Corps to cross Antietam Creek, turn Lee's right flank and attain Lee's rear area. General Toombs' 2nd and 20th Georgians defended Rohrbach's Bridge and by noon this \\"....relative handful of tough Georgian Rebels\\" had repelled five bloody attacks and accomplished their mission in holding the army's right flank.<br />AT 1:30 P.M., with ammunition running low, the battered Georgians had to retreat and by 3:00 P.M. the sixth Federal assault captured the bridge. Now only General Toombs' and Colonel Benning's forces could stop McClellan from sweeping to Sharpsburg and gain the rear of Lee's army. In late afternoon, the surviving Georgians, with the help of General Maxcy Gregg's newly arrived South Carolinians, counterattacked and stopped Burnside's IX Corps. Hill now arrived, joined the fighting and helped drive the IX Corps back to the Antietam Creek; however, the text notes that Colonel Benning wrote concerning the counterattack that \\"none of [Hill's troops] had any part in first breaking the line.\\"<br />On page 150, the author notes that \\"Despite two improbably successes on the same day, Toombs, Benning and their Georgians would not receive due recognition in the post war years.\\" Defending the Burnside's Bridge all morning and then the late afternoon counterattack by Toombs and Benning all played a very significant role in reversing the tide of battle and ended McClellan's chance to defeat Lee.<br />Finally on page 153, the author writes \\"Fewer than 300 Georgia defenders preserved Lee's vulnerable right flank and rear for most of the day, and bought time for Lee to reposition troops from his right to his left and for Hill to arrive.\\"<br />For those interested in Civil War history, this short work places the fighting on Lee's right flank at Antietam in proper perspective. Had Toombs, Benning and the Georgians not held Lee's right and then not successfully counterattacked, McClellan would have deteated the Army of Northern Virginia before Hill arrived.<br />(1)  Wiegley, Russell; A GREAT CIVIL WAR: A military and Political History 1861-1865; p-153<br />(2)   Thomas, Emory; ROBERT E.

Lee and the 35th Star	Books	3	3	3	N	N	Divided They Fell	Control over northwestern Virginia during the Civil War was critical to Confederate<BR>offense or defense; however, the history of campaigns in western Virginia have been<BR>overshadowed by the military events in eastern Virginia. The author notes that the two<BR>regions of Virginia were fundamentally separated before the Civil War \\"....by reasons<BR>of  climate, soil and situation, Eastern Virginia remained the region of large plantations,<BR>with heavy slave population, and profitable agriculture, especially in the production of<BR>tobacco. West Virginia....having been settled by hunter, pioneers, lumberman and miners,<BR>possessed little in common with her more wealthy and aristocratic neighbors beyond the<BR>mountains.\\" As the text notes, Virginia was already divided.<br />The author debunks the myth of Union solidarity in western Virginia stating that while<BR>60% of the population were pro-Union, 40% of the population were Southern<BR>sympathizers and they controlled 60% of the counties. The text states that on June 2nd the<BR>first land battle of the Civil War took place when Confederate Colonel Porterfield's<BR>command was surprised and being outnumbered fled in chaos in a defeat dubbed the<BR>\\"Phillippi Races.\\"<br />Many of the future problems that were to plague both armies were evident in the fighting<BR>in western Virginia. The text illustrates the problems of incompetent, politically appointed<BR>commanders;  one example was the ex-Virginia governors Generals Wise and Floyd<BR>refusing to cooperate and were jealous of each other. Both armies had officers lacking<BR>military experience commanding poorly trained and woefully equipped armies.<BR>Washington and Richmond together with their field commanders lacked working<BR>knowledge of the area's topography, road conditions and seasonal weather so that Robert<BR>E. Lee, a Virginian, had to personally scout the area to gain knowledge of the field. In<BR>addition, due largely to miserable field conditions, disease played a formidable and tragic<BR>role for the armies in the field which was an \\"insurmountable obstacle to any offensive<BR>campaign.\\"<br />The author states that \\"during the last half of July (1861), Federal forces worked diligently<BR>to place a firm military grip on the areas of West Virginia under their control. The text<BR>outlines the 1861 battles at Carnifax Ferry, Cheat Mountain, Sewell Mountain and<BR>Barstow. However, before Lee had any realistic opportunity to succeed in the west \\"and<BR>just four months into the war it seemed that the division of the Old Dominion was<BR>assured.\\" On October 29th Lee returned to Richmond for another assignment and by the<BR>end of November the West Virginia campaigns of 1861 were over. The Confederacy<BR>having lost control of the area in 1861, on June 20,1863, West Virginia became the 35th<BR>state in the Union. <br />The author states \\"that the South's attempts to retain West Virginia were feeble at best.\\"<BR>He concludes writing \\"The Northern forces were not entirely successful either. They<BR>were....more the beneficiaries of an initially inept enemy, than the heroes of a successful<BR>campaign....The almost wilderness nature of the country, with its weary miles of steep<BR>mountain roads that became impassable in wet weather, and the acute absence of forage<BR>for animals were elements which the Federal commanders greatly underestimated.\\"<br />Historian have not documented the 1861 battles in West Virginia as completely as<BR>the later battles in eastern Virginia; however, the strategic failure of the Confederacy to control<BR>western Virginia exposed the Army of Northern Virginia's left flank often requiring<BR>deployment of critically needed forces from eastern Virginia thereby limiting Confederate<BR>strategic options in the east. <br />The serious reader of Civil War history will find this account informative.	2002-01-04

Questions remained as to (1) why did Langsdorff disobey orders and engage a British force; (2) why did the damaged Grap Spee make for British-friendly Uruguay instead of German-friendly Argentina; and (3) why did Langsdorff scuttle his ship instead of making a nightime escape across shallow water to Argentina? The author, Eric Grove, addresses these questions in a well researched account much of which is from previously unpublished private sources. <br />Contrary to popular belief, under the limitations of the Versailles Treaty the German pocket battleships were not designed as commerce raiders but were built to counter a naval threat in the Baltic Sea. However, with the outbreak of W.W.II, these ships were employed as commerce raiders, and the text narrates the Graf Spee's 1939 commerce raiding in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans.<br />In direct disobedience of standing orders not to engage enemy naval forces even if they were inferior, when returning to Geermany for a shipyard overhual Captain Langsdorff decided to attack escorted convoys. On 13 December Langsdorff closed range to attack a convoy encountering not a convoy but the British cruisers HMS Ajax, HMS Achilles and HMS Exeter under the command of Commodore Henry Harwood. The author notes that Langsdorff could not run because the British cruisers would shadow the Graf Spee until reinforcements arrived so that &quot;Langsdorff knew he had to sink or disable all three enemy ships.&quot;<br />The text contains a good account of the battle. The Graf Spee was hit at least 23 times and sufferred 37 killed and 57 wounded including the captain who remained in command as Graf Spee was chased towards neutral water. Unaware of the pro-British feelings, Langsdorff put in to Montevideo where he hoped Grap Spee could repaired for a return to Germany. Commodore Harwood remained off shore in neutral waters with HMS Achilles and HMS Ajax; the damaged HMS Exeter was sent to the Falklands for repairs. Grap Spee was trapped in Montevideo. The text gives an excellent account of the gamesmanship played by British and Germans diplomats in Montevideo; the Germans wanting their ship repaired and the British working to delay its departure until naval reinforcements arrived. Uruguay decreed that Graf Spee carry out essential repairs and leave by 2000 hours on 17 December.<br />Germany did not want the Graf Spee interned in Uruguay but the ship was not seaworthy on 17 December so that Langsdorff had three options (1) fight the British; or (2) run for Argentina; or (3) scuttle the ship. Erroneously believing British naval reinforcements had arrived, the options of fighting or running weren't considered feasible so the Graf Spee left Montevideo on 17 December and was scuttled. The German crew was picked up by Argentine ships and were interned in Argentina. Criticized by the press for not going down with his ship and having no future in Germany, two days later Captain Langsdorff committed suicide and was buried in Argentina. A respresentative of Langsdorff's former commerce raid prisoners attended his funeral which the author calls &quot;....a remarkable tribute indeed.&quot;<br />The author's account of the disposal of the sunken Graf Spee is intriguing; basically the Geermans indirectly sold it to the British as scrap metal. The text's account of internment is interesting; some escaped internment and once in Germany the officers resumed active service. In a quirk of fate, Graf Spee's gunnery officer was assigned to the Bismark and was killed when the British sank the Bismark.<br />The final chapters outline the history of the remaining German pocket battleships and of the British cruisers HMS Ajax, HMS Achilles and HMS Exeter. Captain Langsdorff had picked a difficult adversary as Commodore Harwood was the leading British authority on combating surface commerce raiding.  Following the battle, Harwood was promoted to admiral while for disobeying orders Langsdorff paid with his life thus becoming the Graf Spee's 38th fatality.<br />This excellent book is well worth reading. Other W.W.II events have overshadowed Graf Spee's battle; however, the Royal Navy's victory over Graf Spee was important as it was the first British victory in W.W.II.	2001-12-04

There were strategic military reasons for  Sherman's  march<BR>through central South Carolina. Columbia \\"was an important war manufacturing<BR>center--one of the few still in Confederate hands--providing munitions, equipment, and<BR>uniforms....central South Carolina contained the last Confederate sources of food<BR>untouched by war.\\" Governor Magrath pointed out to Jefferson Davis that the borders of <BR>South Carolina were Richmond's second line of defense which was confirmed when<BR>Richmond fell less than two months after Columbia surrendered. <br />The author outlines the wartime conditions in Columbia noting that both the civilian and<BR>military authorities were tardy in realizing the obvious danger to the city and even slower<BR>to act. Finally the author writes \\"The missing ingredient with the Confederate camp....was<BR>a belief in the possibility of success. The defeatism of Beauregard's leadership was<BR>abundantly clear....\\"<br />Chapter 2 gives a succinct account of  the evacuation of Columbia noting that inspite of<BR>the desperate condition of the Confederate armies, the large arsenals and war supplies in<BR>Columbia were not evacuated.  The cotton in storage was moved into the streets with<BR>orders for it to be burned which contributed to the later fires. Columbia Mayor Goodwyn<BR>surrendered the city while scores of bewildered Columbians, in an ill-conceived attempt to<BR>placate a dreaded conqueror, began distributing alcoholic beverages to the soldiers. This<BR>precipitated an insurmountable problem.<br />A balanced account of the burning of Columbia is given. The most damaging fire began<BR>about eight p.m.on February 17th, was of inexplicable origin and was not extinguished for<BR>six or seven hours when the wind abated. With drunken men roaming the streets, rioting<BR>and acts of personal violence were bound to occur. Confusion reigned and most control<BR>over the city was lost . The extent of the damage following the fire is reviewed. About<BR>one-third of Columbia was destroyed with the business community virtually wiped out and<BR>265 residences burned.<br />Regarding who burned Columbia, the conclusions were (and still are) along partisan lines. <BR>South Carolinians charged Sherman as \\"morally responsible for the burning of Columbia\\".<BR>Union officers and troops felt that while the events in Columbia were regrettable they<BR>were the results of acts of war. Sherman entered South Carolina to disrupt the state's<BR>transportation system and bring an end to the war by destroying Southern morale.<BR>However, Professor Lucas notes \\"The failure of Sherman's psychological warfare, a new<BR>kind of war which Southern civilians did not understand, was that the hatred generated<BR>during the invasion did not terminate with the war's end.\\"<br />The post war criticisms of and charges against Sherman and the Union army are reviewed.<BR>The author notes that the Confederates as they evacuated the city began the looting and<BR>plundering then the entering Federal troops seized what was left. The unanswered<BR>question of incendiarism, the most disputed issue, is complicated by a lack of reliable<BR>eyewitness accounts.<BR>In summary, Sherman failed to take timely and sufficient action to control both the fires<BR>and the riots. However, the author notes that the failure of Confederate leadership in the<BR>defense of South Carolina and the evacuation of the city played a major role in creating a<BR>situation which resulted in the destruction of the city. In addition no preparations were<BR>made by Beauregard, Hampton or the city fathers for the official surrender of the city<BR>when a formal declaration of Columbia as an open city may have produced positive<BR>results.<br />In conclusion, Professor Lucas writes that the burning of Columbia was a great tragedy<BR>for South Carolina and the Unionstating \\"....when the Union Army left Columbia on<BR>February 20, 1865, it left behind bitter hatred. Many citizens had lost everything they<BR>possessed, while others had gone through the catastrophe relatively unscathed. All,<BR>however, suffered psychologically. They had promised to give their \\"all\\" in defense of<BR>South Carolina and the Confederacy; it was painfully apparent that few had done so. Long<BR>before Columbia was captured, Columbians had given up.\\"	2001-10-19

At age twelve he became<BR>enthralled by the photo of Tenzing Norgay on the summit of Everest which began a <BR>lifelong attraction to Mount Everest that didn't end until 1997. After the family left a<BR>harsh and abusive father (a career army officer), the family returned to Cheyenne,<BR>Wyoming where the author attended public school and started to develop rock climbing<BR>skills. The text narrates his development of rock climbing skill and describes several climbs<BR>as he progressively made more difficult climbs. The author notes \\"In the American<BR>climbing system, climbs are rated not only by the degree of difficulty....but also by length<BR>and commitment....\\"and reveals that there is a well defined \\"pecking order\\" among rock<BR>climbers with your climbing social position determined by the ratings of the climbs that<BR>you have completed. While this may appear narrow minded and prejudiced, mutual trust<BR>and respect between climbing partners is critical and the author notes \\"The most<BR>fundamental aspects of climbing are trust, respect and self-reliance. A tacit understanding<BR>with your companion is that you are experienced enough to know your limits and to not<BR>endanger others.\\" <br />After the family moved to Colorado, he wrecked his mother's car returning from a climb.<BR>Needing money to repair the car, he worked in the Wyoming oil fields. While not directed<BR>related to his climbing career, Breashears account of his oil field experience is intriguing.<BR>However, he was glad to return home when spring arrived.<br />Over half of the text is devoted to his learning the art of  film making and to his<BR>increasingly more difficult climbing experiences. He first was involved with Everest when<BR>he served as an assistant cameraman for ABC-TV's American Sportsman. Later, he got a<BR>taste of Hollywood working in the Italian Alps on the movie \\"Cliffhanger\\" where he once<BR>had to perform astunt for Sylvester Stallone; unfortunately due to camera failure his work<BR>was not recorded. His climbing and film experience drive the text; however, his<BR>descriptions of the society and culture of the people in Nepal and Tibet are both<BR>fascinating and educational. His account of  filming the award winning documentary \\"Red<BR>Flag Over Tibet\\" is informative. Breashears' earlier experience in Tibet was when it was<BR>first occupied by China; however, when filming Red Flag Over Tibet, Tibet was being<BR>colonized by the Chinese and the Tibetan culture was being destroyed.<br />Much text is devoted to his climbing and film experiences in the Himalayas, however, the<BR>high point of the book is his account of the May 10, 1996 tragedy on Mount Everest.<BR>Using an IMAX camera, Breashears was to shoot a full length film of climbing to  the<BR>Everest summit. His expedition arrived at the 17,600 feet Base Camp in late March 1996. <BR>Along with the IMAX team, ten other teams would be climbing the south side of Everest,<BR>a virtual Everest traffic jam. The author provides interesting comments regarding the two<BR>major commercial expeditions whose clients paid to be guided on Everest by professional<BR>climbers. <br />On May 10, having postponed his summit climb due to weather conditions, at five P.M. he<BR>received the first dire news of the nightmare unfolding below the summit. The next<BR>morning there were desperate calls for help, but their was little the IMAX team could do.<BR>The author narrates the unfolding tragedy. While not judgmental in his observations, the<BR>author provides many insights to the tragedy. His account of the miracle survival and<BR>evacuation of Beck Weathers, who survived almost by shear will power, is inspiring.  If<BR>the reader has read Jon Krakauer's book \\"Into Thin Air\\", they should read this book for a<BR>balanced account.<BR> <BR>The IMAX team was given the option to terminate the project, but they decided to go<BR>back up andcomplete the film. In spite of the many technical difficulties of film making on<BR>top of Everest together with the idiosyncrasies of the IMAX camera, the IMAX team<BR>reached the summit on May 23, 1996 and completed the camera work using their last<BR>500-foot roll of film, good for just ninety seconds of filming.<br />The author returned to Everest in 1997 to film a documentary for the PBS science series<BR>NOVA. He reached the summit one year to the day after he had scaled it in 1996. After<BR>narrating the 1997 Everest climb, he closes the book writing  \\"....in this moment of pure<BR>clarity I realized that ascending Everest had been for me, both a personal declaration of<BR>liberty and a defiant act of escape. Now, suddenly, I felt an inexpressible serenity, a<BR>full-blooded reaffirmation of life, on Everest's icy ridges. At last, I was ready to descend<BR>the mountain and go home.\\"	2001-09-25

Movies, books and articles have narrated the Battle of Britain. Most limited their narrative to the<BR>heroic efforts of the RAF pilots, crews and commanders. Richard Overy gives the rest of the<BR>story in this book providing insight into the total picture. He notes that for the British people<BR>The Battle meant one thing, the Battle of Britain which was the epic contest between the British<BR>and German air forces in the late summer and autumn of 1940. <br />Chapter 1 observes that during the 1930s, Britain envisioned Germany delivering an airborne knock-out blow for which there was no defense. In response, between 1937 through 1939,millions were spent on an airborne defensive shield and an expanded Bomber Command if required for retaliation. The German strategy was to use air power in combined operations with the army to impose a decisive defeat of enemy ground forces. Britain was unprepared to meet this type of warfare. Therefore when France was attacked, Britain could supply little effective air support to aid the French. At this point, the British were not united. The author narrates the policy debates over whether to<BR>appease or fight Germany. However, the fall of France and Dunkirk shocked the country and British morale was revived to fight on. Hitler, the author notes, regarded invasion as very<BR>hazardous and hoped for a political settlement. Hitler made a peace offer in a July 1940 speech which Britain promptly rejected in a radio address. Britain now faced the air power type of conflict it had been preparing for since the 1930s. <br />Chapter 2 evaluates the two forces noting that The military confrontation in the autumn of 1940 became a test of strength between two rival air forces. The text notes both armies trained for the coming battle; but ....none of this mattered as long as the German air Force had not won mastery of the air over southern Britain. Command structures are described noting that Herman Goering was both air minister and air force commander while the British had an Air Minister, Sir Archibald Sinclair, with separate commanders for fighters and for bombers. To Sir Hugh Dowding, of Fighter Command, fell the task of creating an effective defense shield. The author writes Sinclair epitomized that British elite of dignified public servants so much despised and ridiculed in German propaganda. Goering, on the hand, was everything Sinclair was not. The text notes that on 10 August 1940, The German single-engine fighters assigned to the battle over Britain was 1011, slightly fewer than Fighter Command thus destroying an enduring myth of the few against the many. The book compares fighter production, performance and armament noting that early in the battle there was rough parity in fighter number, but in the last weeks the British had the edge. Another myth is the shortage of trained RAF fighter pilots. The number of RAF pilots increased by one third between June and August 1940. The Germans could cope with pilot shortages because of a lower loss rate. The author writes If Fighter command were the few, German pilots were fewer. The British air defense system, set up to counter the enemy bombing offensive, is described and it was adjusted in the summer of 1940 to meet an invasion threat. <br />Coastal Command played a difficult, costly and critical role twice daily conducting reconnaissance of German controlled ports. Bomber Commands role was to wear down German resistance by<BR>bombardment of vital objectives. The author notes that The one field of battle where British preparations proved at least equal to the task in 1940 was fighter defense and it was for that<BR>reason alone that German air fleets concentrated on destroying Fighter Command using fighter sweeps in a war of attrition. German daylight bombing of London began on 7 September when<BR>350 bombers raided the east dock area and the text notes The air battles in the week between 7 September and 15 September were decisive in turning the tide of the battle. During that week the German Air force lost 298 aircraft. Fighter Command lost 120, against 99 enemy fighters. Another myth that Richard Overy debunks is that Hitler never seriously planned an invasion,writing that There need be no doubt that under the right circumstances Hitler was serious about<BR>invading Britain in 1940.... but that by the end of September Hitler concluded that air superiority had not been achieved and indefinitely postponed an invasion. Lacking daylight bombing success, the Germans shifted to night bombing thereby creating a problem as aircraft were very difficult to shoot down at night from the air or from the ground until new detection equipment was<BR>developed. Overy states that though the Germans never formally adopted terror bombing, the tactics they employed caused widespread civilian casualties resulting in the death of 40,000 people during the Battle of Britain and the Blitz.<br />The Battle of Britain did not seriously weaken Germany and her allies, but the contest was not a draw. German air fleets did not gain air supremacy over southern Britain. The author observes<BR>that In a great many respects, however, the two forces were remarkably matched. Both commanded a small group of committed, highly trained and courageous pilots, both forces responded with considerable tactical ingenuity to sudden changes of direction in the course of the battle; both exploited fighter aircraft at the cutting edge of aviation technology; both forces fought<BR>the battle with operations commanders of real distinction.<br />Finally, this was not a traditional battle in that it did not have a clear-cut beginning nor a defined ending. However, the author concludes that like Trafalgar, the Battle of Britain was critical to the British people in that an invasion scare subsided and the nation could now get on with the task of<BR>winning the war.	2001-09-14
US	51075913	R1L8GXA6M17SCI	0700610162	416168373	In Deadly Combat: A German Soldier's Memoir of the Eastern Front (Modern War Studies)	Books	5	108	113	N	N	An Infantryman's Story	Much has been written about the Wehrmacht, discussing strategies, campaigns, results and commanders; less has been written about the common German soldier in W.W.II. In this<BR>extraordinary book, Gottlob H. Bidermann narrates his experience in the 132 Infantry Division on<BR>the Eastern Front from June 1941 to May 1945 followed by surrender and internment in Russia<BR>until the summer of 1948. He was commissioned and received officer training in 1943 but<BR>continued to be assigned to the 132 Infantry Division. Bidermann's memoirs were written for and<BR>distributed to the survivors of his regiment and division, and originally were not for general<BR>audiences. Derek S. Zumbro, a US Naval officer and friend of the Bidermann family, was given a<BR>copy of his memoir in 1985 by Bidermann which Zumbro translated; the memoirs were published<BR>as the book IN DEADLY COMBAT.<br />The text is basically an accurate chronology of the events Bidermann personally experienced on<BR>the Eastern Front. Daily death, suffering and destruction was encountered and the author states<BR>\\"We tended our wounded, buried our dead and moved forward to the next encounter, knowing<BR>that eventually, we would meet the end of our journey\\". He later notes \\"Most of us owed our<BR>lives to the skill and self-sacrifice of other in our company, many of whom were no longer with<BR>us.\\" <br />It is interesting to read the author's personal reactions to brutal combat. He relates how his<BR>training and discipline gave him life saving split second reactions when face to face with the<BR>enemy. While generally not critical of German combat general officers, many of whom he<BR>admired, like the common soldier in all armies he \\"called it like was\\". For example, commenting<BR>on one general \\"And the highest commander, to whom credit for the catastrophe should be<BR>awarded, was not present to witness what his decisions had wrought. As always, the soldiers in<BR>the field bore the brunt of these mistakes and paid with their lives.\\" In another case he wrote<BR>\\"When captured\\" General Shoerner \\"was wearing a traditional Bavarian alpine costume, for<BR>which he had exchanged his uniform and golden party badge. Only weeks earlier he had subjected<BR>untold numbers of soldiers to summary execution for similar displays of cowardice.\\"<br />Equally interesting is his attitude serving on the Eastern Front, as his division went from a<BR>conquering army in 1941 to the desperate fight for survival in the Courland pocket. Bidermann<BR>writes \\"....those who continued to cling to the belief in a \\"final Victory\\", now realized the<BR>hopelessness of our situation. That said the will to resist the Soviets, the fighting spirit within the<BR>ranks of the Courland fighters, remained unbroken\\" resulting in the fact \\"....the troops in<BR>Courland were .... the only combat units in the German army that were never defeated in open<BR>battle.\\" The author makes the interesting statement \\"We saw the true sense of our operations in<BR>Courland as having one clearly defined objective: the defense of European culture...\\" then he<BR>laments that the West ignored what he termed \\"the tragedy unfolding in eastern and central<BR>Europe. Communism descended on an entire culture....\\"<br />The text is dictated by the framework of the German army in which Bidermann fought, by the<BR>nature of the Reich and largely by a set of cultural and intellectual conventions in the army which<BR>differed widely from those of the British and Americans. These factors contributed a cohesiveness<BR>that allowed Germany to maintain front-line effectiveness when units like the 132 Infantry<BR>Division fought the enemy for 3 1/2 years, almost without relief. Amazingly, Bidermann relates<BR>that within the framework of the army there were no plans, policies or training for retreat and a<BR>strategic withdrawal which could have reduced losses and preserved unit strength. When orders<BR>were received to surrender on May 8, 1945 the author writes \\"The philosophy of fighting to death<BR>had become so ingrained within us during the past years that to surrender, as we were now being<BR>ordered to do, was inconceivable.\\" Although they knew that the Russians liquidated thousands of<BR>Polish officers in Poland and expected possibly the same fate, the culture and strict discipline of<BR>the army did not allow for disobeying orders; Bidermann's division surrendered as ordered.<br />Throughout the text, references to events at home are noted such as \\"....our relatives lived in a<BR>daily terror of the bombs....\\" and \\"The attempted assassination revealed that the war was lost.<BR>Hitler was nothing more that a dictator in brown.\\" Then finally, \\"In general, news of the death of<BR>Hitler was received by the troops with indifference; however, it must also be said that some<BR>breathed a sigh of relief.\\"<br />The Epilogue describes of the brutal life in the Soviet prisoner of war camps. The text states \\"In<BR>the twentieth century prisoners were often afforded little or no protection in any form and<BR>remained free game for the victors. One could beat them, work them to death, shoot them or<BR>simply let them starve.\\" Bidermann observed all of this in Soviet prisoner of war camps. It should<BR>be noted that the same philosophy was followed in Japanese prisoner of war camps. In contrast,<BR>the author states \\"In the United States prisoners had confinement vastly different from our ordeal<BR>in the gulags. They were well-fed and in the best of health....\\"<br />While the writer did not report witnessing atrocities, neither does he ignore their existence. This<BR>work is refreshing as it narrates the hard, brutal life of a front-line an infantryman in combat with<BR>none of the usual apologies of \\"we were just following orders.\\" often found in other memoirs.<BR>This is a \\"must read\\" for those interested in W.W.II history.	2001-09-05
US	51075913	R2UGEZFCSJDH20	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	5	15	18	N	N	A  MAN FOR  ALL  SEASONS	Using many sources, but basically drawing on the extensive collection of the Adams Papers housed in the Massachusetts Historical Society in Boston, David McCullough has written a fascinating biography of John Adams.  Unlike conventional biographies, the text covers his immediate family devoting considerable detail to his wife, Abigail, which makes for a balanced narration. This is a biography of John Adams and not a history of the Revolution and the post revolution era so that incidents, actions, etc. not closely related to John Adams are given minimum coverage making for a contiguous account that is not distracted by events (though important) in which Adams was not involved. By quoting from their numerous letters, journals and diaries, this is a highly personal account revealing Adams and Abigail's thoughts and feelings.<br />The narration of Adams activities in France, Great Britain, Holland and Belgium is fascinating. This is a subject that is only briefly covered in most survey courses of American history so that the casual reader of history will find the text well worth reading. The intrigues and manipulative politicians in Europe made for a serious challenge to John Adams' abilities and for the future of the new nation.  In many respects, the European attitudes the text outlines in Adams era are still present today regarding America.<br />The text notes that Adams recognized the critical role of a navy for gaining and then maintaining independence. The author states \\"That he pressed doggedly for a greater part in the war by the French navy would stand as one of his own proudest efforts, and with reason given what happened at Yorktown.\\" During his presidency he initiated a program of navy ship construction and persuaded Congress to authorize funds to equip and man three frigates constructed during Washington's administration, but never equipped for service. These became the three famous frigates CONSTITUTION, UNITED STATES  and CONSTELLATION. He further recommended to President Jefferson the establishment of a Naval Academy to which Jefferson agreed. The founding of the US Navy was one of Adams greatest accomplishments.<br />McCullough provides an excellent account of Adams' relationship with Jefferson.  Jefferson is not pictured in the typical honorable schoolboy image, but rather the text gives a balance account of Jefferson who did not always follow the highest ethical principals especially regarding political<br />rivals. The author notes that Adams never knew when Jefferson, his Vice President, might be working secretly to undercut or thwart him, for Jefferson's abiding flaw, Adams had concluded, was \\"want of sincerity\\". Most interesting is the text's narration of the 1791 public controversy over Jefferson's endorsement of Thomas Paine's pamphlet THE RIGHTS OF MAN. Jefferson had endorsed the pamphlet and in private correspondence ascribed to Adams \\"the political heresies that have spring up among us\\" and then blamed the pamphlet printer for his endorsement. In 1809 at the urging of his friend Benjamin Rush, Adams wrote Jefferson, their friendship was renewed and remained strong through the rest of their lives.<br />The text tells of Adams less than high opinion of Benjamin Franklin who Adams considered lazy.  In Adams written documents, the image of Franklin as a wholly honorable statesman/scientist is brought into question. However, Adams still had high praise for Franklin stating that if he had done nothing else then invent the lightning rod he had done the world a great service.<br />The text also narrates many situations which were a harbinger of the American Civil War noting the strong differences between New England and the South principally with Jefferson's Virginia.   The author quotes Adams who wrote \\" I know it is high treason to express a doubt of the perpetual duration of our vast American empire, but a struggles between the states over slavery might rend this mighty fabric in twain.\\"<br />In his easy toread narration, the author describes the political world in early America.  This account is most intriguing since if only the names and the dates are changed, politics and government today is the same as in Adams age. For example. McCullough writes \\"Colonel Smith was in Washington. Having failed at nearly everything he ever tried, he had lately been elected to Congress\\" and Adams is quoted as stating \\"I would to God there were more ambition in the country....ambition of that laudable kind, to excel.\\" In another example, the text notes that \\"The more Adams thought about the future of his country, the more convinced he became that it rested on education and wrote \\"The education of a nation instead of being confined to a few schools and universities for the instruction of the few, must become the national care and expense for the formation of the many.\\" Today, politicians are debating the same topic.<br />To be sure John Adams had his faults and the author does not try to ignore his shortcomings in this biography. His support of the Alien and Sedition Acts was most reprehensible.Perhaps his greatest fault was that he was hard headed; however, this was tempered by Adams integrity. In today's \\"me first\\" and \\"what's in it for me\\" society, it is pleasant to read the biography of a person (even a whole family) which put public service above self interest. The reader may not agree with McCullough, but will never find the book dull reading.	2001-08-16
US	51075913	RMNO2E51321HZ	0743200799	940393502	Failure Is Not an Option: Mission Control from Mercury to Apollo 13 and Beyond	Books	4	8	8	N	N	Tour de Space	Using his extensive files (over 7 file cabinets) and numerous sources, Gene Kranz  reviews each launch and narrates his participation in the space program from Mercury through Apollo. An amazing amount of detail is given for the numerous difficulties that were encountered in each phase of the space program. The recognition of problems, troubleshooting them and quick resolution is the driving force in this text. Readers remember Apollo 13's fuel cell crisis and the excellent job done by both Mission Control and the crew to safely return the space craft home.  However, while not as dramatic as Apollo 13's potential for astronauts being lost in space, several other incidents that could have resulted in tragedy are detailed along with the actions taken to overcome each difficulty.<br />The text is an account of Gene Kranz's career from procedure writer to Flight Director and details the history of the development of  NASA's Mission Control  organization. There being no previous experience, the book outlines how the Mission Control organization was developed from scratch. The text illustrates that in space, team work and training was mandatory to be able to evaluate a problem and initiate action often within 60 seconds. This required a high degree of commitment and competence for all persons involved.<br />Kranz's accounts of training through simulation is fascinating.  Malfunctions were programmed into the training without prior knowledge of the persons in the training session. In one case the simulated collapse of the mission doctor was so real that after the training session others had to be told the doctor was fine. Such detailed and stressful training  and the actual mission performance required a detailed knowledge of systems by each person for their area of responsibility plus knowledge of adjoining areas. This training frequently revealed problems where such knowledge later paid off in successful missions.   <br />The author briefly outlines the background of each person as they appeared in the narration. They were basically a mix of young engineers and aviators some having test pilot experience. All parties had to live by a time line whether it was during planning, training, launch, flight or recovery. The text clearly states that participation in the space program demanded discipline, commitment and risk. Some readers may criticize Gene Kranz for his strict military attitude, discipline and unwavering commitment but the question must be asked what other alternatives would have worked in situations where decisions had to be made in seconds for malfunctions involving life and death?  I am reminded of the old saying  \\"A camel is a race horse designed by a committee.\\" As the author clearly illustrates, in space there was no margin for error or time for debate.<br />Also covered are several non-flight activities such as upper management, debriefings and press conferences. Each debriefing was critical to the success of the next mission especially if critical malfunctions had to be addressed. The text states that the space program was covered by a dedicated, well-informed, and highly professional press corps who \\"....knew the difference between objective reporting of news and hyping things up to entertain the audience....\\" Kranz notes that \\"The press conference was almost as much of an ordeal as the mission\\" and further states \\"They asked the tough questions, but they respected us and the work we did as long as we didn't try to mislead them.\\"<br />Flight directors worked rotating shifts. Gene Kranz was a flight director for Apollo 11 during the actual first lunar landing and later led the team that developed the program to recover Apollo 13 after it suffered the fuel cell explosion. The text gives much interesting information about both flights. The last moon landing was Apollo 17 where once again Kranz was a flight director.<br />The book concludes with the usual chapter Where They Are giving an update of the history for the major players. <br />The book provides a tremendous amount of information. Readability may be a minor weakness of this work, but a most helpful appendix Glossary of Terms defines the many acronyms used in the text and helps the reader to move ahead. While not difficult to read, at times it is slow reading unless the reader is just skimming.  <br />While some may take issue with Gene Kranz's stern, disciplined, military approach to the challenges faced, the results confirm the effectiveness of this approach to life and death situations where decisions must be made in seconds and there is no turning back once a decision was made. <br />A must read for those interested in a time when the United States successfully met a major challenge.	2001-07-30

Rowland, develops his thesis that General George McClellan has been unfairly characterized by both contemporaries and historians. The first half of the book discusses the common criticisms of McClellan. In Chapter 2 the so called psychological profile on McClellan is reviewed stating that \\"Of all the reasons why McClellan may have been a gravely flawed commander, the exploitation of  the psychological model is the most flawed itself....\\" He notes that both Grant and Sherman \\"....trailed a significant baggage of personality deficiencies into the Civil War\\" observing that \\"If anyone came close to experiencing a psychic episode during the Civil War it was Sherman in Kentucky.\\"<br />In the chapter discussing McClellan's lesser faults, the author notes that both Grant and Sherman had similar faults, but they weren't judged by these faults nor should McClellan's strategic abilities be evaluated by his peccadilloes. Acknowledging that McClellan played a major role in his poor working relations with Lincoln, the author notes that \\"....the president was not frank about how military goals were to be shaped by the political dimensions of the rebellion.\\" In addition, Stanton's dislike of McClellan did not help in the commander's poor relationship with the president. However, the author does not imply that McClellan was faultless noting \\"....his failure to delegate authority and his obstinate secrecy\\" Another fault was his unwillingness to take risks. The greatest question is whether he made the best use of the Army of the Potomac.  Rowland concludes that \\"In any comparison with other Civil War commanders, particularly those to whom he is unfavorably compared, McClellan's personal shortcomings were not that remarkable.\\"<br />Chapter 4's discussion of the early months of war provides valuable insight into the ultimate conduct of the war. The widely held Northern belief that most Southerners were not committed secessionists initially led to a limited war strategy. After the First Manassas McClellan recommended that to restore the Union in the shortest time, the North had to \\"crust the rebellion at one blow....\\" Rowland notes \\"McClellan's was....a well reasoned strategic proposal. His conservative views.... reflected....widespread appeal throughout the North at that time....\\" In support of this strategy, he launched the Peninsula Campaign which was undermined by Washington politics and lack of support. The book states<br />\\"....the half defeat on the Peninsula.... spelled the end of the conciliatory\\" strategy. For this campaign to succeed, joint operations were mandatory; and the author observes that in the early stages of the war, the inability of Federal armies to cooperate in joint operations contrasted sharply with the military situation Grant inherited in 1864.<br />The review of  civilian leaders alarm regarding Washington's safety is noteworthy. Extraordinary concerns for the capital's safety contrasted with months of endless nagging McClellan to assume the offensive. However the troops needed for an offensive had to come from those providing the capital's defense. Both McClellan and Grant faced the problem of Washington's safety with McClellan trying to comply and Grant often giving only limited support. The book concludes \\"McClellan's Peninsula campaign, the first major Federal offensive in East, experienced problems uniquely its own, not the least....was the administration's failure to sustain plans they had.... agreed to support.\\"  During the first two war years, many Northerners believed the Confederates would be quickly defeated perhaps in one major campaign. When McClellan assumed command in 1861, he inherited an untrained and disorganized army. The author notes that McClellan implemented schools of  instruction and all volunteers were given basic training directed by an experienced officer. In addition, he recognized the deficit in trained officers (several were political hacks) and arranged effective training. The book frequently notes, that the training and organizing of the army was a major contribution. Considering, the sheer folly of his predecessor's taking an unprepared army to defeat at the First Bull Run, McClellan's unwillingness to assume the offensive in 1861 with an untrained army was prudent and not excessive caution. Unfortunately, in 1862, politics and lack of support doomed his Peninsula campaign.<br />Rowland writes \\"....little attention is paid to the context in which McClellan dealt with the difficulties that faced the Federal army in the first fifteen months of the war. ....his early tenure deprived him of the advantage of leading mature and seasoned civilian soldiers, adapted to the demands of a new age of warfare....\\"  As one historian noted, McClellan \\"suffered the frictions and frustrations of being first.\\" The text notes that Sherman observed that Napoleon took three years to build an army and \\"....here it is expected in ninety days...\\" The author notes the irony that McClellan was relieved of command when  \\"He had effectively divided Lee's army into widely separated halves, intending to drive between them. The celerity of those moves alarmed Lee....\\" This could have been a critical blow.<br />The text continues that McClellan might have been forgiven a multiple of failures had he kept his eye on the military objective, the destruction of the Army of Northern Virginia. However, McClellan's strategy to capture Richmond was not without merit as Richmond was a critical manufacturing, transportation and financial center.  The Tredegar Iron Works alone justified the capture of Richmond. Richmond's fall during the first two war years would have been devastating to the Confederacy. Regarding Antietam, Rowland  correctly notes that regardless of McClellan's shortcomings, Antietam was a Union victory. McClellan had stopped Lee from delivering a demoralizing blow on northern soil.<br />The book concludes,  \\"McClellan's strategy, though reflective of the unrealistic war aims of the years 1861-62,was cogent, reasoned, and consistent with conventional military wisdom.... McClellan can scarcely be elevated to the ranks of the great captains of war, but he was hardly the worst that the conflict dragged into the center stage.\\"<br />The book is somewhat repetitious and devotes too much space to comparing McClellan's faults with similar faults of Grant and Sherman. However, the book is worth reading for its discussion of Union military and political strategy during the first two years of the Civil War.aining.

US	51075913	R1EAOTFF40FIJ7	080613187X	604477713	Return to Bull Run: The Campaign and Battle of Second Manassas	Books	5	16	16	N	N	THE CAMPAIGN AND BATTLE OF SECOND MANASSAS DEFINED	John Hennessy has written the definitive account of  the Campaign and Battle of Second Manassas. Regarding the Union commander, the text states  \\"John Pope has come to us as a bumbling fool....But in the summer of 1862 he possessed many of the qualities the administration felt it needed in Virginia.  His record was not so much impressive as solid.\\" Chapter 1 notes that the government was partly responsible for the Second Manassas defeat writing \\"...the real problem lay not just with Lincoln's military inability's, but with the government's insistence on using the military as a refuge for political patrons.\\" The book recalls an interesting fact noting that Pope's infamous orders No. 5, subsisting off the land; No. 7, guerrillas; and No. 11, disloyal citizens were approved in advance by Lincoln. Order No. 5, directing subsistence off the land, was especially onerous as the it was used as a license to loot.<br />This was Robert E. Lee's first full campaign as commander of the Army of Northern Virginia and the Federals gave Lee the strategic initiative in Virginia by abandoning the Peninsula. The book details Lee's campaign from the Rapidan to the battle at Manassas. Many interesting and critical events prior to the Manassas are described. While the two armies were stalemated on the Rappahannock, Stuart's raid striking Pope's rear is narrated followed by an account of Stonewall Jackson's August 25 flanking movement which resulted in the burning of  Bristoe Station and the capture of Manassas Junction August 27th. The author notes that throughout these actions Pope's cavalry failed to produce intelligence about Lee's movements and intentions but rather \\"stood ragged and impotent\\"<br />John Hennessy details the bloody battles on August 28, 29 and 30. The author writes \\"Pope's decision to attack Jackson near Groveton was both momentous and fateful, for Pope was committing to fight a battle on Jackson's front and Jackson's terms.  It was a battle that need not have been.\\" The book describes how the Union commanders under Pope launched attacks against Jackson which often breached his lines but lacking coordination and support from other units, after much gallantry failed with heavy losses. For example, the text states \\"Grover's regiments had indeed performed admirably, but the more important point was that they fought alone, and were doomed to ultimate failure.\\"   The author provides an excellent analysis of each engagement plus<br />gives both the background and an evaluation of the commanders involved stating that Pope never provided the leadership for the required coordinated action and support for these attacks to succeed. <br />The arrival on August 29 of Longstreet's Corps in support of Jackson and the failure of McClellan to support John Pope dramatically changed the tactical and strategic situation. The author notes that by 5 PM on the 29th \\"Longstreet suggested that the major effort be postponed until morning\\" and Lee laid the groundwork for \\"what he hoped would be a decisive attack the next morning....\\" Most interestingly, Pope concluded  \\"the enemy was retreating; indeed the battle might be won!. ... quickly decided to mount a pursuit.\\" The text continues \\"History could hardly have conjured more disparate--and ironic--reasoning ....Pope thought the Confederates in wild retreat; Lee sought to lay the groundwork for the battle's climatic attack.  No other incident of the campaign more succinctly demonstrates the diverging quality of command each side enjoyed, or, in the case of the Federals, suffered.\\" Hennessy writes that after waffling all morning on the 30th and rejecting what information he received, Pope ordered General Porter to attack what Pope believed to be retreating Confederates. After a gallant and tenacious effort, Porter's troops had to retreat.  An interesting story from this fight was the stone-throwing by some Confederates after their ammunition was gone. The text notes, amazingly  Pope failed to recognize thedanger to his left and continues \\"With Porter long since gone from his threatening position ....Longstreet recognized his opportunity to completely envelop the Union left.To accomplish this, Longstreet selected as the objective of his attack the old battleground of Henry Hill.\\"<br />At 4 P.M. on the 30th, Longstreet attacked the Union left. The author notes that  \\"Union defeat seemed a certainty.  Only the magnitude of the defeat remained in doubt.\\" and he continues \\"The position most important to the safety of the Union army was Henry Hill\\" The author provides an excellent account of the fighting for Chinn Ridge and Henry Hill; and states that the Confederates captured Chinn Ridge but due to Union General McLean's fierce defense, precious minutes were gained allowing the Federals time to organize the defense of Henry Hill. With only an hour of daylight remaining, the battle for Henry Hill ceased. The Confederates had not captured Henry Hill thereby allowing the Federals to retreat, but the Union left was turned and crushed; Pope had been outmaneuvered and out fought.<br />The book describes the Union retreat, the subsequent fighting with a final battle at Chintilly, and Pope's withdrew to Washington DC. The Epilogue gives an analysis of the campaign stating \\"The well-oiled performance of the Confederate army contrasted sharply with the disorganized toil of Pope's Army of Virginia. Few Yankee soldiers of any rank emerged from the disaster at Second Manassas with enhanced reputations....\\" except for General McLean on Chinn Ridge.<br />For the Confederates the text notes \\"Second Manassas represented James Longstreet's most important contribution to any of Lee's victories.\\" Hennessy notes \\"The Second Manassas Campaign also marked the emergence of Robert E. Lee. it represented the happiest marriage of strategy and tactics he would ever attain....\\" In summary he states \\"The Confederate victory at Second Manassas was primarily a triumph of maneuver and timing abetted greatly by Yankee mismanagement.\\" <br />The author concludes \\"That John Pope lost this campaign to R.E. Lee was the fault, primarily, of John Pope....He utterly failed in the basic responsibilities of commanding an army on the battlefield.\\"	2001-06-05

When writing this history, the author had access to numerous sources including letters, interviews and tape-recorded information from former airship officers.  For example, Appendix D is a copy of  the Confidential 1959 letter from Captain Marion H. Eppes (former Commander of Fleet Airship Wing One) to the Chief of Naval Operations giving his recommendations for airships in the Navy.The result is a well documented, well written account of a weapons system that due to politics and budget considerations never realized its true potential.<br />Chapter 1 describes the establishment of Lakehurst Air Station with emphasis on the design and construction of Hangar 1. Lakehurst was designed for the construction and operation of rigid airships with one airship ZR-1 (USS Shenandoah) to be built at Lakehurst and a second rigid airship, ZR-2 to be purchase from Britain.  ZR-2 crashed in Britain without being delivered.<br />  The chapter on the Shenandoah foretells future problems for navy rigid airships stating  \\".... hostage to the airship's own propaganda and obsessed with public acceptance ....the navy `brass' continued to expect too much from their large airships, and far too soon.\\" The Shenandoah's short life ended with its 1925 destruction in storm over Ohio. While the Shenandoah did little to develop the rigid airship as a weapon system, the author notes that \\"....the program had taken its first, faltering steps, Personnel had been trained, valuable experience accumulated ....\\"<br />The navy received ZR-3 (USS Los Angeles) from Germany in 1924 as war reparations. It was treaty limited to civilian usage and couldn't be used with the fleet to develop an airship scouting doctrine. Chapter 3 gives an excellent account of this airship's career in experimentation and training. It was instrumental in developing the low mooring mast, and in developing a system for recovering and launching airplanes from an airship. Budget problems resulted in the Los Angeles being deactivated in 1932. <br />Althoff's has written a succinct review of the navy's program to develop a fleet-type rigid airship. The navy contracted with Goodyear Zeppelin Corp. for two high-performance, fleet-type rigid airships ZR-4 (USS Akron) and ZR-5 (USS Macon). ZR-4 was christened in August 1931. The Akron's 1932 performances with the fleet were at best a qualified success and a doctrine for its effective use wasn't developed. Much time was devoted to public demands to see the Akron. Upon encountering a severe storm at sea in April 1933, the Akron was lost. The Macon, christened in March 1933, became proficient in launching and recovering her five scouting airplanes. The Macon developed the concept of the airship as an aircraft carrier and by mid 1934 became highly effective using her aircraft for long range, wide area scouting.  Unfortunately, failure to complete repair of a damage fin resulted in the Macon's loss in February 1935 thereby ending the navy's rigid airship program.  <br />The text notes that the navy responsibilities included supporting civilian rigid airship development in the United States.  The navy supported domestic rigid airship programs by making the Lakehurst facilities available to Germany's commercial rigid airships as German and the United States companies were to jointly develop a commercial transatlantic airship service. Few people realize that the Hindenburg in 1936 provided scheduled nonstop air travel to Europe twenty years before the DC-7 began nonstop flights to London.  With the Hindenburg crash in May 1937, rigid airship activity ceased at Lakehurst and the deactivated Los Angeles was dismantled in 1939. <br />The book's narration of the navy's W.W.II blimp program is excellent.   The text notes that navy blimp activities prior to W.W.II were at best marginal. However, with the deliveryof blimp K-2 in 1938, the navy had a long-range patrol and convoy escort which became the prototype for the successful  W.W.II K-type blimp. When the Japanese struck at Pearl Harbor, the navy had but ten blimps of all types to patrol the entire East Coast and only one air station --Lakehurst. By March 1944 the navy had 119 blimps with air stations on the West Coast and with East Coast air stations extending to Recifi, Brazil. The installation of airborne radar and the Magnetic Airborne Detector (MAD) increased the escort effectiveness of  blimps. Airship development continued with the delivery in 1944 of  the new M-type blimps having a useful load of 11,900 pounds and a still air range of 2100 nautical miles. During W.W.II, blimps safely escorted 50,000 ships in areas of known enemy submarine activity. Thirty-eight airships were lost and seventy-seven personnel killed.  Enemy action accounted for one fatality with personnel error responsible for most losses. <br />This book provides an excellent narration of the navy's postwar airship programs. Following severe downsizing after W.W.II, the airship program added advanced blimp types ZS2G, ZPG-2 and ZPG-3 plus further modernization's of the K-type. A basic Airborne Early Warning (AEW) blimp emerged in the 1950s from a modification of the ZPG-2 and ZPG-3 types. This is a fascinating period in navy airship history which is well told by this book. In March 1957 a ZPG-2 set an unrefueled endurance record of 264:20 hours--11 full days aloft. In July 1958 another ZPG-2 reached the air force's ice station T-3, less than 800 miles from the North pole covering 6200 miles with two refueling.<br />However, as the book notes \\"From the earliest years, the navy had failed to recognize the airship as a special type....requiring attention by officers qualified in and familiar with it and its peculiar problems.\\" Faced with budget limitations and having little political or naval brass support, on 24 September 1962 deflation of the last operational navy airship began and the navy's airship program ended after 57 years.<br />Though published over ten years ago this book is still well worth reading by both the serious aviation historian and the aviation buff.	2001-04-17
US	51075913	R34L8TMIW45AFC	006103004X	893798538	Blind Man's Bluff: The Untold Story of American Submarine Espionage	Books	5	98	99	N	N	MOVE OVER TOM CLANCY	Confronted with fading memories, secrecy oaths, security clearances and old loyalties, the authors have done an outstanding  job writing a fascinating account that rivals the best cold war fiction. This is a true story of American submarine espionage during the cold war and as the authors note \\"In silence and stealth, but most importantly in secrecy, attack subs carried out as many as two thousand spy missions as they kept track of Soviet submarines\\". <br />In chronological order, the book covers US submarine surveillance during the cold war beginning with the loss of the diesel submarine USS Cochino and ends with the post cold war secrecy problems still facing the families of lost submarine sailors on both sides.  Narratives are given for several incidents such as the submarine USS Gudgeon being caught in Soviet waters and  forced to the surface by the Soviets. A most intriguing chapter covers the 1968 loss of the US nuclear submarine Scorpion as it returned from a mission to the Mediterranean Sea. Using acoustic data, a submarine simulator and advanced mathematics, it took nearly five months for scientists to locate the Scorpion. Although the evidence points to an on board torpedo explosion, to this day the cause of the sub's lost is still in dispute.<br />Blind man's bluff involved tracking Soviet subs, surveillance of missile launches and  communications monitoring.  Soviet subs were trailed by US submarines to determine the submarine's characteristics, patrol areas plus Soviet Naval operational philosophy and tactics. The book contains a fascinating account of the USS Lapon tracking a Soviet missile sub for 47 days. However, tracking was dangerous. There were several underwater collisions, with the text describing the one where the USS Tautog collided with the Soviet submarine Black Lila.  The book states \\"Tautog flipped on her right side, rolling nearly 30 degrees as she was forced backward and down.  Men went grabbing for a handhold on rails and tables.  Coffee mugs, pencils, rulers, charts and erasers went flying through the control room.\\" While both submarines were heavily damaged, neither sub sank, although each submarine's commander thought the other had sunk. In a post cold war interview, the Black Lila's commander stated \\"I thought for a second, `I have sunk a brother submariner'....It was hard to have realized it.\\"<br />The book narrates the US attempt to raise a sunken Soviet submarine.  After locating the sub, Naval Intelligence proposed to remove missiles and code materials using robots. The CIA disagreed, intervened, and took over. Ignoring international law, the CIA contracted with Howard Hughes to build a special ship to recover the entire submarine under the pretex of searching for manganese.  The project failed with only a 38-foot piece recovered. The Naval Intelligence's approach was validated years later when Navy robots were successfully used to explore the Titanic. <br />The book's high point is the narrative of  wire taps on Soviet cables in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Soviet White Sea. Under great danger, taps were place on Soviet military cables by divers working outside a specially equipped surveillance submarine. At considerable risk, taps were periodically serviced to recover data tapes. Servicing a tap, the Seawolf  once got mired for nearly two days on the bottom of the Okhotsk Sea. To avoid detection, the secret surveillance submarine Parche traveled 15,000 miles one way on a indirect route to place a tap on a White Sea cable and gain intelligence on Soviet Arctic operations. The Soviet's use of the Arctic ice was a critical strategic move and the authors note that \\"the Soviets shift to the Arctic was a brilliant move....where it would be hugely difficult for US forces to root out Soviet missile subs and destroy them.\\"<br />Throughout, the text describes the personalities involved discussing  the differences arising between individuals, groups and agencies.  The handling and briefing of  the President, Congress and/or Congressional oversight committees is most interesting. A key player through much of the book is John Cavens of Naval Intelligence. Cavens and his scientists developed the techniques that successfully located the nuclear bomb dropped into the Mediterranean following an Air Force B-52 mid-air collision, located the sunken Soviet sub and pinpointed the location of the lost USS Scorpion. <br />In summary, the text notes \\"While satellites replaced many of the spy planes and made intelligence-gathering safer....submarines continued to confront the Soviets directly\\" and concludes \\"There is no question that some skippers went too far in their quest for the big score.  But then the Navy and the intelligence agencies weighed the gains against the possibility of a violent response, they relied on one simple fact:  the Soviets were sending out their spies as well.\\" <br />The text ends stating that \\"Now, with the end of the cold war and a new phase in submarine espionage beginning, it's time to look back, time to assess what has so long been hidden.\\" Whatever may be the readers views regarding  the cold war, the book tells how so many US Navy submarine sailors when \\"in harms way\\" so that Americans could sleep safely at night.<br />The book finishes with appendices and notes which alone are worth book's price.  Appendix A describes nineteen confirmed or probable submarine collisions during the cold<br />war while Appendix B gives the Soviet side of this story.  <br />Following the appendices, notes give the sources for each chapter. The principal player's remarks are often  revealing.  For example, Admiral Watkins, former Chief of Naval Operations, stated that he allowed the U.S.Naval Institute - a private, nonprofit organizations that works closely with the Navy - to publish Tom Clancy's novel The Hunt for Red October as part of the Navy's psychological warfare against the Soviets.  Admiral Watkins said  \\"about two-thirds of the technical information in Clancy's novel is on target and the rest is wrong, and that it typically overstates the US abilities....\\" The Admiral continues that the book \\"did us a service....The Soviets kind of believed it, and we won the battle....\\"	2001-02-15

The narration continues with  the saving of the Zeppelin Company by building the US W.W.I reparations airship Zeppelin LZ-126, later christened Los Angeles.  The balance of the chapter briefly narrates the building of the famous Graf Zeppelin and its round-the-world and early flights.<br />Following the Golden Age, the losses of the American rigid airships Shenandoah (ZR-1), Akron (ZR-4) and Macon (ZR-5) are described together with the loss of the British rigid airship R-101 and the tragic loss of the Italian airship Italia. The successful polar flight of the Italian airship Norge is briefly noted, but the successful transatlantic flight of the sister ship to the tragic R-101, the R-100, is ignored. The government designed and built the R-101 while the R-100 was designed and built under contract by the Vickers Corp. This was a classic case of competition between private and government enterprise. Tremendous political pressures attended the design, construction and testing of the R-101 contributing to its tragic ending.  After the R-101 wreck, the successful R-100 was scrapped.<br />Next, the author devotes three chapters to the Hindenburg Zeppelin, LZ-129.  While the Hindenburg is described , much of the material in these chapters describe the effects on the Zeppelin Corp. of the social, political and economic conditions in  Nazi Germany during the 1930s. The Hindenburg narration ends with a description of the May 6, 1937 spectacular loss of the Hindenburg at the Lakehurst Naval Air Station.  The political consequences in Germany of the Hindenburg wreck are described along with a brief review of the investigations as to the cause.<br />The last chapter covers airship history from the Hindenburg to date.  The descriptions of  recent airship projects is interesting; however, the current work in Germany by the old Zeppelin Corp. and a new company CargoLifteer AG isn't covered.<br />Readers unfamiliar with airship history will learn little from this book. Basically it is just another airship tragedy book. The critical and tragic influence of Nazis Germany on the  Zeppelin Corp. is emphasized to the exclusion of  other important airship history.  During its long career, the Graf Zeppelin made 590 flights traveling 1,060,000 miles safely carrying 13,000 passengers; a record not exceeded by an airplane for many years .  No reference is made to the successful scheduled  passenger flights to Brazil with the Graf Zeppelin making 59 round trip flights from 1931 to May 1937 plus seven round trips to Brazil by the Hindenburg in 1936. Also the Hindenburg made ten round trips passenger flights to Lakehurst in 1936 . In contrast, transatlantic airplane passenger flights didn't begin until 1939 with large flying boats making numerous enroute refueling stops. Not until 1957 did scheduled direct nonstop service from New York to London begin with DC-7Cs, twenty years after the Hindenburg's nonstop North Atlantic flights.<br />Although W.W.I was a period of enormous advances in airship design and technology , as large and efficient airships were supplied to meet the needs of the Germany Navy for naval scouting and air raids, the book only states \\"Between 1914 and 1918, Germany alone acquired 88 military airships\\" . The success of the German Navy Zeppelins was an incentive for Allied postwar rigid airship programs. Also not mentioned was the 1908-1931 British airship program, an ambitious program that built 18 rigid airships and designed 21 blimps. Badly under funded, only limited results were achieved andthe program ended with the loss of the R-101.<br />The description of the US rigid airship program is at best cursory being limited to twelve short paragraphs. The structural design of ZR-1, Shenandoah, was based on German Naval Zeppelin L-33 shot down over England in 1916. L-33 was a so called \\"high climber\\" with a light structure for operation in the thin air at high altitudes to avoid intercepting airplanes. This was a contributing factor to ZR-1s loss as it lacked structural strength to operate on helium a low altitudes in foul weather. No mentioned is made of the fact that the US Navy successfully operated the Los Angeles, LZ-126, using helium for ten years as a training airship.<br />The most glaring omission of this book concerns US Navy blimps in W.W.II. The text states \\"....the Allies found a limited use for airships during the Second World War, mostly as anti-submarine escorts\\". US Navy Blimps escorted 89,000 ships in W.W.II without a single loss to enemy submarines with 50,000 ships escorted in areas of known U-boat operations with only one blimp lost through enemy action. Blimps operated on both US coasts,operating on the east coast as far south as Santa Cruz, Brazil and after June 1944 in the Gibraltar area of the Mediterranean.  This could hardly be called \\"limited use.\\"<br />In 90 pages of text, far too many pages are devoted to the Hindenburg tragedy while ignoring the magnificent engineering accomplishment the Hindenburg represented.  Its lost was due to being inflated with hydrogen and not due to a design defect. It is unfortunate, that the author did not write a more comprehensive history of airships. Finally, the US Navy blimps in W.W.II qualify to be classified as  \\"Great Airships\\".and the program ended with the loss of the R-101.<br />The description of the US rigid airship program is at best cursory being limited to twelve short paragraphs.

US	51075913	RCNUKP14313M7	0803232128	766880512	Atlanta 1864: Last Chance for the Confederacy (Great Campaigns of the Civil War)	Books	5	33	35	N	N	MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA REVISITED	Richard McMurry writes an interesting account covering the1864 military and political events in North Georgia stating \\"Gettysburg had brought no alteration in the relative strength or position of the opposing armies or in the course of the war\\" noting that Union successes at Gettysburg, Vicksburg and Chattanooga boosted Northern morale and assured that southerners couldn't gain a military victory and secure Federal recognition of Confederate independence. The author outlines the responses of the Confederacy and Union to this strategic dilemma with a narration of Sherman's North Georgia campaign that ultimately resolved the problem. <br />Lincoln appointed  Grant commander of the Federal Armies and Jefferson Davis appointed Joseph E. Johnston, a general he did not trust; commander of the Army of Tennessee and the text states \\"All the Rebels would pay a very high price for Jefferson Davis long-standing evasion of the command personnel problems in the West.\\" The author makes the fascinating observation that \\" By 1864 two irrefutable facts about the conflict should have been clear....neither side was likely to win the war in Virginia. The Confederates were too skilled to loose, at least as long as Lee lived, but not strong enough to win.The Northerners...were too strong to lose the war in Virginia but not skilled enough to win it there.\\" <br />McMurry notes that Grant having nearly achieved military victory in the West, Grant made two decisions that made a Northern victory costly while enhancing Confederate independence chances. The strategy in Virginia to defeat Lee and prevent moving Rebel troops elsewhere; and two, appointing  Sherman in Georgia instead of  Thomas. Both decisions resulted in \\"Ten of thousands of Americans --North and South-- paid for this misjudgment with their lives....\\" and \\"The outcome of the war remained doubtful much longer...\\"  The author observes that Thomas finished the war as a general \\"who never suffered defeat on a battlefield where he wasin command\\" concluding \\"On the basis of his record, Sherman did not merit such a promotion....\\"<br />Both Sherman and Johnston had command personnel problems. Johnston inherited a command muddle which one historian described as a \\"pit of vipers\\". The narrative and analysis of Sherman's campaign from North Georgia to Atlanta is informative. Sherman dependence on the Western &amp; Atlantic Railroad limited his strategic options to only advancing toward Atlanta because that was where the railroad ran. <br />The writer makes the intriguing statement that Union General McPherson's seizure of Snake Creep Gap on May 7th probably \\"determined the outcome of the campaign.\\"  adding the fascinating opinion \\"....if Grant had allowed Thomas to succeed to the command of the Military Division of Mississippi by seniority, the 1864 campaign in Georgia would have ended two or three weeks after its opening with \\"....a crushing Federal victory that, for all practical purposes would have ended the war in the West....ripping open the entire center of the Confederacy\\" and \\"save many lives during the last eleven months of the war.\\"<br />As the campaign proceeded, Johnston would fortify a strong position and hope Sherman would attack. Sherman was not going to launch a massive assault against strong fortifications and moved against the Confederate left and flanked them out of every prepared position including Dalton, Resaca, Allatoona, Kennesaw Mountain, and Smyra. On July 8 Sherman crossed the Chattahoochee and the battle for Atlanta was imminent.  <br />Davis replaced Joe Johnson with Hood on July 18, 1864 and the text notes \\"Rarely has a general assumed command of an army under more inauspicious circumstances than those facing John Bell Hood.... His army was backed up to a city it had to hold\\" which limited his strategic options and maneuvering room. Hood reversed Johnston's conservative policy striking Sherman at Peachtree Creek, Atlanta and Ezra Church but failed to cripple or destroy the opposing force.  <br />Sherman ,after trying artillery for several days,  realized the only way to force Atlanta's evacuation was to cut off all rail traffic into and out of the city. Interestingly, the text also notes \\"Hood too, sought some means of ....forcing his opponent to give up his position at Atlanta.\\" Hood initiated an unsuccessful cavalry raid on railroads supporting the Federals. Sherman finding cavalry ineffective against railroads used infantry to cut the Macon &amp; Western Railroad isolating Atlanta and Hood forcing the Rebels to abandon Atlanta. The Rebels after opening government warehouses to anyone (military or civilian) to take food, clothing etc.the Rebels burned what they couldn't take with them including five locomotives and  28 freight cars containing ammunition which exploded leveling adjacent buildings in a scene well depicted in the movie Gone With The Wind. Hood's infantry cleared Atlanta by 01:00 AM, September 2. Shortly after daylight Mayor James Calhoun rode north of Atlanta and surrendered the city.<br />The author concludes with an excellent analysis of the generalships of Sherman, Johnston and Hood noting that Sherman as a field general was \\"probably not much above average\\".   However, by 1864 Sherman had developed a grasp of the geopolitical-psychological strategy, matched by few, realizing that a war can be won \\"by destroying the enemy's society and its logistical-economic-social infrastructure and he put that doctrine into practice on a grand scale....\\" McMurry states Davis contributed to the Rebel command failures in Georgia through his failure to involve himself in western matters.<br />McMurry concludes \\"Grant's much-vaunted plan did not work\\" and \\"It was a Confederate policy....that kept Lee from sending troops to reinforce the Rebels in Georgia, not the pressure of Grant's assaults on the Confederates in Virginia.\\" Failure of Grant's plan resulted in tens of thousands of casualties. <br />A strong point throughout this work are the brief parallel accounts given of military and political activities in other areas providing a balanced account of the situations facing both Northern and Southern governments and their commanders. The books ends with two appendices analyzing Grant's strategy and Johnston's railroad strategy plus two excellent appendices titled \\"Numbers and Losses\\" and \\"The Atlanta Campaign and the Election of 1864\\".	2001-01-02
US	51075913	R21OBX5DI2DD8T	0684846098	975528807	Nothing Like It in the World: The Men Who Built the Transcontinental Railroad, 1863-1869	Books	5	16	17	N	N	HEADLINE NEWS - Late 1860s	With the end of the Civil War in 1865, except in the ex-Confederate States where reconstruction news dominated, during the late 1860s the headline news in the U.S.A. was the building of the transcontinental railroad.  Stephen Ambrose does an excellent job narrating this event beginning with Lincoln's 1859 meeting with Grenville Dodge, later chief engineer for building the Union Pacific, to the driving of the golden spike on May 10, 1869.  In 1853 Congress called for a survey of possible routes. A discussion of route selection opens the book, with the last miles actually not being settled until shortly before the Central Pacific and Union Pacific met at Promontory Point. Most interesting is the author's narration of the early pioneer surveyors especially Theodore Judah who determined the most feasible route through the Sierra Nevada Mountains.<br />Alternate chapters cover the progress of each railroad, beginning with the Central Pacific in the west followed by the Union Pacific from the east.  This is fascinating reading as the Union Pacific moves west battling Indians and many adversities while the Central Pacific struggles with the Sierra Nevada's granite mountains where tunnel progress was measured in inches per day.  Both railroads were troubled by weather especially heavy snow. The Central Pacific ultimately had to build almost 50 miles of snowsheds to protect the railroad in the mountains.  For both the Central Pacific and the Union Pacific, each chapter describes the construction, financial, political and organizational problems for the project phase being covered. The chapters are well documented with the frequent references and quotations from letters and telegrams resulting in a comprehensive narrative.<br />The book notes that without the assistance of the Federal Government the construction of the railroad during the 1860's probably would not have been possible. The author describes how Congress passed legislation which fostered a race between the two railroads as they built toward each other. The Federal Government awarded land grants and cash to each railroad based on the mileage graded and tracks laid with premiums paid for the difficult/expensive mountain construction. The cash was to be repaid by bonds which were guaranteed by the Government. A race was a natural result as each railroad tried to build the most trackage. Consequently, as the time of completion neared, the two railroads actually graded for track that paralleled and passed each other.  The description of how the actual meeting point was established and the associated financial maneuvers by each party makes for fascinating reading.<br />Throughout out the book, Ambrose develops a balanced description of the major players; none are all bad or all good with the contributions of each being described. As expected personalities were a major factor which both aided and/or abetted their cause.  Their lives after completing the transcontinental railroad is given thereby completing their story.<br />The book also notes a  rarely considered fact that even before the completion of the transcontinental railroad \\"there was an event of grand importance to the scientific and industrial revolution....the first transcontinental telegraph line was opened.\\"  With the telegraph line in operation the East Coast could communicate with the West Coast in a matter of seconds and was a great, albeit expensive, assistance in building the railroads.  The building of the transcontinental railroad would have been very difficult, if not virtually impossible, had just land and sea communications been only available.  The reader should note the large number of telegrams that the authors quotes which is only a faction of the total number sent while the railroad was being planned and built.<br />The last chapter is an epilogue.  Here Ambrose writes \\"Mistakes were made all along the line, caused both by errors of judgment and certain cynicism, encouraged by Congress, and cheered onby the population at large.  There was an emphasis on speed rather than quality, on laying much track and making as much grade as possible rather than doing it right.\\" He continues \\"One glaring reminder of the waste was the two grades running east and west from Promontory Summit, parallel to each other.\\" Following the completion of the transcontinental railroad, newspapers launched what the author calls \\"the biggest<br />scandal of the nineteenth century\\", and Congress went after the railroads because the transcontinental railroads would not exist without the government having loaned them money with government bonds and given them land grants. Ambrose notes that \\"The land grants are much misunderstood, especially by professors teaching the American history survey course.\\" He concludes that while many of  the owners of the railroad's stocks and bonds were guilty of most of the charges made against them, the author states that the land grants never brought in enough money to pay the bills of construction. Furthermore, he  notes, that the bonds were not a gift but loans which had to be paid back in thirty years or less.  This obligation was met.<br />Other transcontinental routes were later completed including in 1881 a  railroad over the southern route consisting of the Texas and Pacific and Southern Pacific and by the end of the 19th century the United States had four transcontinental railroads. However, the Central Pacific with the Union Pacific was the first transcontinental railroad and this book is their story. <br />This book is a history of a critical period in the United States, the end of the 1860s, when both transcontinental transportation and communication was completed put in operation so that the East Coast was now united with the West Coast. The book concludes with the statement \\"Things happened as they happened.  It is possible to imagine all kinds of different routes across the continent, or a better way for the government to help private industry, ormaybe to have the government build and own it.  But those things didn't happen, and what did take place is grand.  So we admire those who did it -- even if they were far from perfect -- for what they were and what they accomplished and how much each of us owes them.\\"	2000-11-11

Lee on the Offensive	Books	4	16	19	N	N	Lee's Offensive Strategy	In the book's preface, Professor Palmer asks the thought provoking  question  \\"Did he and his lieutenants simply have a couple of bad days? Or were there other factors at work? ....could the strategic offensive, then be the shared thread, the common denominator that might help to explain Lee's failures?\\"  He then reviews Lee's Maryland, Gettysburg and Bristoe Station campaigns to answer his question.<br />In Chapter 1, Palmer states that lacking published plans and with an ambiguous objective, Lee moved into Maryland without Jeff Davis's prior approval .  The author asserts that the Maryland campaign was a Federal success and allowed \\"the Lincoln administration to solidify its political support....\\" Quite the contrary happened. Aghast at the Antietam casualties, northern voters in the 1862 fall elections for governors and congressmen, gave Lincoln's party several major reverses. The chapter makes the ridiculous comparison that \\"Lee was one of many southerners caught up in a wave of `victory disease', not unlike that which gripped the Japanese before the battle of Midway\\".  The Japanese defeat at Midway  was not due to \\"victory disease\\" but due to their naval code having been broken and Admiral Nagumo's bad tactical decision, <br />Nevertheless, regarding Maryland, Professor Palmer correctly writes \\"Why had Lee failed? The answer is simple:  virtually all of the assumptions upon which he based his plans were unfounded.\\"<br />The Gettysburg campaign chapter is well written and objective.  The review of events leading to the Gettysburg campaign is excellent.  Normally given limited coverage, the narration of the meetings in Richmond with Davis and his cabinet plus the correspondence regarding Lee's Gettysburg campaign is very interesting.  Palmer reviews Lee's organization problems writing \\"....two of the three men leading corps and three of the nine men leading divisions were untested at their new levels of commands....Such dramatic changes in the organization and leadership....suggested the need for delays, not haste.\\" Considerable space is devoted to whether Lee wanted to fight a major battle in Pennsylvania quoting Lee stating in 1868 that \\"he did not want to fight\\" and ending with Lee biographer Emory Thomas's statement \\"that battle was central to Lee's plan.\\"<br />Palmer noted \\"....two fundamental forces worked against the successful execution of Lee's campaign,  First....it was never was properly developed....Second, Lee relied on a very decentralized approach to command and control.\\"   Lee's decentralized command philosophy required component subordinates.  Regarding the competence at Gettysburg  of  Lee's key commanders, Stuart, Ewell, and Longstreet , the book provides a brief review of their failures concluding that \\"....while Ewell's incompetence and Longstreet's recalcitrance were important factors, Lee's unwillingness to issue direct orders or to take charge of the battle lay at the root of the problem\\".<br />Analysis of  Lee's strategic offensive continues with a review of the Bristoe Station campaign.  Again Lee initiated a campaign in secrecy, without a clearly stated objective, no detailed operation plan and limited or misleading communications to Richmond. The author speculates that one motive for the campaign was to prevent further detachment of Lee's troops to the west and states \\"Lee moved north to engage Meade because the latter had not come south....Had Meade been more aggressive in August or Lee been able to take the offensive, Davis would never have sent Longstreet west.\\" The book notes that the command problems evident at Gettysburg had not been corrected and lacking capable corps commanders another debacle occurred. Professor Palmer states that \\"while Heth and Hill were blamed, Lee also bore some responsibility for the failures of  his subordinates\\" and concludes at Bristoe Station \\"....for Lee to attack an army twice the size of his own in October was absurd.\\"<br />Evaluating Lee, in the fourth and final chapter the author asks the critical question \\"Could the South have won the Civil War?\\" Professor Palmer contends that while the North had countless advantages, the Confederacy had several advantages noting that the South did not need to invade or conquer the North to win stating \\"The Confederacy had only to survive until the Yankees lost their will to continue the struggle.\\" Referencing the writings of Clausewitz and Delbruck, Southern strategies are evaluated noting that the Confederate government failed to adopt either a strategy of exhaustion or of annihilation.  He further states that Lee's contributed to the South's failure to adopt a consistent strategic policy in that he usurped Davis's role as commander-in chief while Davis failed to respond and shape a well-defined national strategy.<br />Professor Palmer writes Lee launched all three offensives without anything approaching a formal plan basically commanding by the seat of his pants. He writes \\"LEE'S TWIN PENCHANTS for the offensive and for secrecy contorted the outline of Confederate national strategy between 1862 and 1863 and led to his own failures as a commander.\\" He notes that the traits that served Lee so well for strategic defense failed him when his army went over to the strategic offensive.  <br />The book's weakness is that it does not ask \\"why ?\\" With Lee's respect for authority, why didn't Davis control strategy directing Lee to comply and fully reveal his plans?  Why would  a commander noted for honesty and integrity try to deceive Richmond? Regarding a strictly defensive strategy, was Lee independently responding to Frederick the Great's chilling aphorism \\"He who defends everything, defends nothing.\\"? Why was Lee secretive, was it solely to deceive or was it basically because both North and South were getting critical intelligence from the newspapers? Etc.<br />Some may take offense at the concluding statement  \\"...what Lee failed to understand was that a commander of an army can no moreeffectively shape national strategy on the sly and on the cheap, than a tail can wag a dog.\\" But for the historian or serious student of the Civil War, this short book is worth reading as thought provoking, often controversial,  issues are raised.	2000-10-17
US	51075913	RIRQYPWHSKTCL	1574880276	364846015	Confederate Raider: Raphael Semmes of the Alabama	Books	5	17	18	N	N	Commerce Raider Extraordinar Civil War to WW II	In contrast  to many Civil War army generals, little has been written about Admiral Raphael Semmes.  John M. Taylor corrects this with his  excellent biography of Raphael Semmes. The book opens narrating Semmes  running the blockade from New Orleans with the C.S.S. Sumter, followed by  three chapters on his pre-Civil War life.  His first command, the C.S.S.  Sumter is covered next. Overshadowed by the Alabama, history often  overlooks  the Sumter.  However, the Sumter was  important! John Kell,  Semmes' First Lieutenant, is quoted after the war \\"I have always felt that  the little Sumter never had full justice done her. . . .No ship of her  size, her frailness, and her armament ever played such havoc on a powerful  foe\\".  It was on the Sumter that  Semmes developed the commerce raiding  strategies/ tactics he used so successfully on the Alabama.<br />Leaving  the Sumter at Gibraltar, Semmes and his officers traveled to Britain.  Taylor's account of  the Confederate agent in Britain, James Bulloch  contracting  for, equipping and arming the Alabama is  fascinating and  reads like a Cold War espionage novel including a mole in the Prime  Minister's office.  Semmes commissioned and took command of the Alabama  in  the Azores then set sail and captured the whaling ship, Ocmulgee, on 5  Sept. 1862.  By the end of October 1862 the Alabama had ravaged the New  England whaling fleet plus dealt a blow to the grain trade between New York  and Britain.<br />The author notes that at this time, Semmes conceived a bold  plan to take the Alabama into New York harbor and fire the ships there. It  is interesting to speculate on possible responses to a raid on New York  harbor as 9 months later the city experienced draft riots which had ethnic,  racial overtones in a northern city with some southern sympathies.  The  plan was canceled after the hurricane of October 16,1862.<br />The book  narrates in chronological order the capture of each  ship by the Alabama  and narrates her activities including a cruise to Asian waters. However,  after 22 months at sea, the Alabama badly needed  shipyard maintenance and  refitting.  Semmes put into the French port of Cherbourg .  While France  hesitated to allow the critical shipyard work,  the U.S.S. Kearsarge  arrived and took station in international water off Cherbourg. Semmes  formally challenged the Kearsarge to battle and in an engagement on Sunday  morning June 19, 1864 the Alabama was sunk. Semmes escaped to Britain  aboard an English yacht.  The book has an excellent discussion of the  possible reasons for Semmes' decision to fight noting that by 1864  Confederate commerce raiding was no longer profitable.  A chance for a  positive international reaction to defeating a Federal warship  was one  consideration for making it worth putting the Alabama at risk in fighting  the Kearsarge because the Alabama's  days were numbered without an  overhaul.<br />After losing his ship Semmes returned to Richmond, was  promoted to rear admiral and given command of the James River Squadron.  With the fall of Richmond and the James River Squadron scuttled, Semmes  became a brigadier general  commanding an army brigade. This interesting  period in Semmes life is well covered by the text. The final chapters  narrate his post war life including  imprisonment, release and  futile  attempts to gain the right to hold the public office of probate judge to  which he had been elected. Semmes was always the unreconstructed rebel and  Taylor describes Semmes' memoirs as \\"the last shot in a war already  lost\\".<br />The author notes \\"Part of Semmes' value to the Confederacy lay in  his versatility.  He was cruiser captain, diplomat, and propagandist in  one.\\" He writes that Semmes was thoroughly versed in maritime law which he  used to direct his activities and further his cause.  For example, the text  states \\"Semmes might have burned Brown's ship out of contrariness, but his  legal training would not permit it.\\" On another occasion, the text notes  \\"Once again, Semmes's seamanship and knowledge of international law stood  him in good stead\\". The author noted Semmes would always take pride in his  treatment of those whom he captured and quotes Semmes saying \\"We were  making war upon the enemy's commerce . . . . not upon his unarmed seamen.\\"  What a contrast to W.W.II where 30,000 unarmed merchant seamen lost their  lives in the Battle of the Atlantic.<br />Admiral Semmes importance goes  beyond the Civil War and his place in naval history is ensured. Taylor  wrote that Raphael Semmes was well remembered by naval strategists in  Europe and quoting from volume 38 of the Southern  Historical Society, he  narrates how Kaiser Wilhem II upon meeting a diplomat from the state of  Alabama said \\"I reverence the name of Semmes.  In my opinion, he was the  greatest admiral of the nineteenth century.  At every conference with my  admirals I counsel them to read and study Semmes's Memoirs of Service  Afloat.\\" In WW I the Germans emulated his disguising his ships and  supporting a cruiser with a tender. In the early days of WW II Admiral  Semmes's tactics/strategy were used by the German warship Graf Spee in the  South Atlantic.  In like manner, early in the WW II other German warships  such as the Hipper and the Sharnhorst conducted surface attacks on British  merchant shipping .  Also, during WW II, German U-boats used his tactics  and strategy and copied Semmes's tender usage using submarines as tenders  to supply and provision U-boats at sea.<br />Semmes accounted for 71 of some  two-hundred-odd Northern merchant ships destroyed plus bonded and released  12 other captured Northern ships. As commander of the Alabama he sailed  some 75,000 miles without touching a Confederate port. He was the only  commander on either side to fight two battles at sea and the only  Confederate captain to sink an enemy warship.  His record as a sea raider  would not be approached until the era of the submarine.  As John Taylor  wrote \\"Semmes was not the first commerce raider of the nineteenth century;  he was simply the best.\\"ccasion, the text notes  \\"Once again, Semmes's seamanship and knowledge of international law stood  him in good stead\\". The author noted Semmes would always take pride in his  treatment of those whom he captured and quotes Semmes saying \\"We were  making war upon the enemy's commerce . . . . not upon his unarmed seamen.\\"  What a contrast to W.W.II where 30,000 unarmed merchant seamen lost their  lives in the Battle of the Atlantic.<br />Admiral Semmes importance goes  beyond the Civil War and his place in naval history is ensured.

US	51075913	R1HOK75KA1ATUR	0684827336	85299297	The Presidential Difference: Leadership Style from Roosevelt to Clinton	Books	5	14	15	N	N	Modern Presidents under the Microscope	Fred Greenstein has written a readable, enjoyable account of the modern presidency covering FDR to Clinton. The author reveals the tone of his book  when he states in Chapter 1 \\"Each of the modern presidents is a source of  insight, as much for his weakness as his strengths.  The variation among  them provides intellectual leverage, permitting comparisons and expanding  our sense of the possible.\\"  Each president is covered in chronological  order by a chapter where they are analyzed on six qualities, Public  Communicator, Organizational Capacity, Political Skill, Vision, Cognitive  Style and Emotional Intelligence. The reader may be tempted to skip and  read only the chapters for the presidents that interest them; however, the  book should be read from beginning to end \\"in sequence\\" as the evolution of   the modern presidency is clearly illustrated as the chapters unfold.<br />The  author avoids the pitfall of attempting to rank the presidents leaving  the  reader to form his own opinion.  Presidents are shown to have defects, and  all presidents are shown to have certain strengths making for a balanced  analysis, i.e. none are total losers or absolute winners.  Readers may be  surprised by positive qualities for presidents, such as Johnson and Nixon,  as well surprise with the shortcomings of  the more popular chief  executives such as Kennedy and Reagan.  The author lists features of these  modern presidents that future incoming presidents and their staffs should  study and/or emulate.<br />An interesting observation Greenstein makes is the  critical importance of  Effectiveness as a Public Communicator .  To  illustrate his point, he relates concerning the 1960 missile gap, that U-2  flights had confirmed to Eisenhower that there was no missile gap and that   in \\"Eisenhower's concept of national security, the United States did not  need to equal the Soviet Union in all areas of military endeavor.  What it  needed was sufficient retaliatory power to deter the Soviets from  aggression.\\"  The author continues that \\"This thesis was eminently suited  for public enunciation . . \\" which Eisenhower failed to so enunciate.   Ultimately this communication failure led to a defense policy that started  a nuclear arms race with the Soviets.  However, Greenstein notes that the  majority of the other presidents also failed to effectively use the \\"bully  pulpit\\".  Today's complaints about public manipulation through presidential  press conferences, speeches, etc. should not be confused with the author's  regard for the importance of effective public communication as a means both  to educate and to inform the public regarding critical issues. <br />Many  persons look upon the presidency as a one man show.  However, the author  clearly demonstrates the critical factor of  how the White House is  organized and the importance of the roles played by the president's staff  and aides.  In some cases the staff and aides made the presidency  successful while in other instances weak, inadequate or poorly organized  staffs resulted in marginal presidential performance.  The book further  notes that even with competent staff , the president did not always use  them effectively often intimidating them into being \\"Yes Men\\". He tells the  story of Chester Cooper of the NCS staff  fantasizing about facing down  Johnson over Vietnam but in his fantasy when Johnson asks \\"Mr. Cooper, do  you agree?\\" Cooper finds himself answering \\"Yes, Mr. President, I  agree.\\"<br />The final chapter, titled Lessons from the Modern Presidency,  summarizes the modern presidency on the basis of the six previously noted  qualities.  Referring to Johnson, Nixon, Carter and Clinton all of whom had  impressive intelligence but defective temperaments, Greenstein ends the  book with the following warning \\"All four presidential experiences point to  the following moral:  Beware the presidential contender who lacks emotional  intelligence.  In its absence all else may turn to ashes.\\"<br />Normally a  book is not known for its appendix.  However, this book has an excellent  appendix titled Background on the Modern Presidency which gives for each  president an outline of  their Life; Elections; Political  Composition of  Congress (during their term);  their Appointments including Vice  Presidents, Cabinet Members and Supreme Court; and finally Key  Events.<br />The reader will be disappointed when the book ends and will wish  for at least another chapter or two if not a second volume.  This is  intelligent, informative, easy reading at its best.	2000-08-03
US	51075913	R2KVPIWIEUCNO2	0807122912	356597305	Lee's Endangered Left: The Civil War in Western Virginia Spring of 1864	Books	5	11	11	N	N	A  Most  Critical Phase of the Civil War	Basically well written and excellently researched , this book offers insights on the critical battles of the Civil War in western Virginia during the Spring of 1864, a subject usually not covered in detail.  The  details provided and the sequence presented on military operations give a  very useful overview of strategy and tactics in this area in 1864.  Richard  Duncan, the author, details the unsuccessful attempts by General Hunter's  army to live off the land which contrasts with Sherman's success in  Georgia.  While Sherman's effect on the civilian population is well known,  the harsh treatment of civilians in the Shenandoah Valley is not as widely  covered in print; and Richard Duncan's account  provides much useful  information and references on the subject of  the Union Army's relationship  with the area's civilians. The importance of the campaigns in the  Shenandoah Valley  during the Spring of 1894 should not be ignored.  Had  General Hunter been successful, the Civil War<br />may have ended six months  earlier. This book well describes Grant's strategy, Lee and Davis responses  and the numerous mistakes made by both armies. Making this account  enjoyable, is the inclusion of  brief  biographical sketches of the field  officers involved  before discussing each operation.  <br />The book suffers  from a lack of  good and sufficient maps.  The maps provided do little to  support the text.  Critically needed are maps on individual battles.  This  is especially true of Chapter 2, The Dublin Raid, where maps are provided  only on Crook's and Averell's routes to and from Dublin; however, maps on  some of the raid's engagements/battles would greatly enhance the text.  In  addition, maps are badly needed for the engagements fought near Lynchburg.  However, both the professional historian and the Civil War buff, would do  well to read this work.	2000-08-02

Rhea's account of the Civil War in Northern Virginia covering the period after the Wilderness Battle through the fighting south of the North Anna River in late May 1864  is well written.  During this period,  Lee and Grant took measure of each other.  Grant had only experienced  Confederate generals in the West and probably had limited respect for Lee's  generalship.  The general officers of the Army of the Potomac, having  fought Lee since June 1862, had few reservations regarding Lee's ability  prompting Grant to remark to his staff  on May 6 to \\"Think what we are  going to do ourselves, instead of  what Lee is going to do.\\" Lee lacked  direct experience with Grant but there is no indication that he questioned  Grant's ability.  Lee's problem was he didn't know how Grant thinks,  reacts, etc.  In many respects this book is an account of  how Grant and  Lee got to know each others abilities.<br />Chapter II details Sheridan' raid  threatening Richmond .  Grant and Sheridan took great pleasure in the  defeat of J.E.B. Stuart.  Sheridan had defeated his cavalry and killed  Stuart. However, the Confederate Cavalry Sheridan defeated in May 1864 was  not the same splendid cavalry that J.E.B. Stuart had led on his June 12-15,  1862 ride around McClellan..  By May 1864 Stuart's mounts were tired, worn  out and hungry with no replacements.  His cavalrymen were also tired,  hungry and replacements were at best limited. Perhaps stung by Lincoln's  remark \\"Who ever saw a dead cavalryman?\\" Sheridan seems to have had a  personal vendetta against Stuart.  As Rhea notes serious criticism can be  leveled against Sheridan's campaign as it deprived Grant of  badly needed  scouting  thus \\"severely handicapped Grant in his battles against Lee.\\"  Grant should have learned this lesson in the Wilderness when critical union  cavalry scouting was also absent.<br />The major battles/engagements from  Spotsylvania Court House to the North Anna River are narrated.  However,  this book is primarily a discussion of  commands with emphasis on Grant and  his subordinates.  Failure to react to promising situations are documented  for both Lee and Grant with both failing to capitalize on significant  opportunities.  Referring to Lee the author noted that \\"His performance was  a masterpiece of defensive fighting . .\\"; however Rhea notes several cases  where Lee missed a significant opportunity and/or incorrectly judged Grants  intended course of action.<br />The author notes an interesting situation  regarding the frequent remoteness of Grant and his commanders from the  field commanders at critical times.  Referring to Lee's army moving down  Telegraph Road virtually unmolested  the author wrote regarding Grant and  Meade \\"After nightfall they made no attempt to coordinate the movements of  their corps and seemed content to leave decisions in the hands of local  commanders.  The union army floundered like a force without a head for  several critical hours.\\"  <br />Finally, Rhea stated that this campaign  suggests the two generals had \\"suprisingly similar military temperaments.  Both were aggressive and willing to try unorthodox maneuvers.\\"  In essence  both generals  came out about equal. Grant's great strength laid in his  firm support of the strategy to destroy Lee's army which was Lincoln's  strategy.  While Lee's true strength was his ability to turn unfavorable  situations to his advantage.	2000-07-24

In less than 100 pages of text, Richard Melzer outlines the World War II history of  security at this critical atomic bomb lab. <br />Chapter 1 outlines the WW II  security at the lab. Some security requirements/efforts were almost  laughable. The chapter ends noting that the lab \\"was considered the most  guarded, most sensitive secretive military or civilian installation in the  United States during World War II\\".  The author notes that \\"in theory\\" the  secret of the atomic bomb was as safe as humanly possible so that not even  the vice president of the United States knew about the project.  The tight  security requirements caused severe problems with the scientists and  technicians who resented the restrictions on their academic freedom, right  of association and travel.<br />Chapter 2 tells how, in practice, security was  compromised when confronted with reality.  The chapter discusses three  major security breakdowns:  #1 Security Clearances, #2 Information Access  and #3 Relaxed Travel Restrictions.  Melzer ends the chapter with the  statement that \\"As any burglar knows, the keys to a successful theft, be it  of real property or of ideas, are entry, access and exit. It was only a  matter of time before eager spies exploited these flaws and carried out the  greatest theft of the twentieth century, the secret to the atomic bomb.\\"  <br />Chapter 3 gives proof of  security comprises outlining the cases of  three Soviet Spies; #1: Klaus Fuchs, #2: Theodore Hall and #3:  David  Greenglass.  Stating that there was enough blame to go around for the  security lapse , the author places the blame at the top on the project  managers, Oppenheimer and General Groves.  However,  Melzer further states  that Groves and Oppenheimer probably could not have kept \\"the lid on\\" and  still completed the construction and testing of the bomb by July 1945.   Completing the atomic bomb by July 1945 may have saved thousands of   American military casualties plus countless Japanese military and civilian  lives.<br />A  History Channel (? ) TV program on the Soviet atomic  development program stated that the Soviets had a viable atomic program.   The program made the intriguing statement that the spy information from the  Manhattan Project, while helpful, only advanced the Soviet program no more  than 2 years. In other words, the Soviets probably would have had the  atomic bomb in 1951 or 1952 anyway and the Cold War only would have started  2 years later than it did in 1949.<br />Richard Melzer concludes the book  stating that Oppenheimer and Groves \\"did the best they could under  increasingly difficult circumstances.\\" He ends with the Colonel Landale's  post-war conclusion that \\"Los Alamos and its great wartime secret was, in  reality, `not so secure after all.\\"  Recent news reports indicate that the  difficulties of managing classified research and the attendant security  conflicts at Los Alamos still exist.<br />This book gives interesting insight  into the problems of managing advanced classified research conducted by  brilliant scientists.	2000-07-24
US	51075913	RZTSJH0VEZ931	0700609210	56678822	Joseph E. Johnston and the Defense of Richmond (Modern War Studies)	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Joseph E. Johnson and the Defense of Richmond	Professor Newton has written a readable account of the generalship of Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston for the period from February 1862 until General Johnson's wounding at the battle of  Seven Pines on May  31,1862.  The book begins with a brief  discussion of  (1) the  deteriorating trust between Johnson and Jefferson Davis; (2) the Department  of Northern Virginia; and (3) the process, including both political and  military factors, used in making the decision to move Johnston's army from  Centerville, Virginia to be closer to Richmond.  The decision and the  details of withdrawal are well documented after which  the author covers  the Peninsula Campaign, the Battle of Seven Pines and ends with an  interesting assessment of Johnston's campaign.<br />Some scholars and Civil  War buffs have questioned the expenditure of resources to defend Richmond  and speculate that a capitol located in the interior of the Confederacy  would have been preferred as being easier to defend. Professor Newton  outlines the strategic importance of Richmond stating that it was a  critical manufacturing, transportation and financial center.  The Tredegar  Iron Works alone justified the defense of Richmond. In addition, the city  had four major banks, had five railroads lines and was a flour-milling  center .  Having established the strategic necessity of defending Richmond,  the writer proceeds to document General Johnston's defense of the  city.<br />The writer objectively narrates the involvement of Lee in the  decisions during this period noting areas of agreement and differences  between Johnston, Lee and Davis.  While Professor Newton openly states \\". .  the tenor of this work is pro-Johnston in terms of my assessment of the  general's handling of his army\\" he favorably reviews Joseph Johnston's  performance without engaging in \\"Lee bashing\\" the approach often used by  revisionist historians to support their thesis.  He gives credit and/or  blame where it is due in his<br />opinion.  This makes for interesting and  provocative reading.<br />Professor Newton gives a balanced evaluation of  General Longstreet's performance.  Longstreet is depicted as neither a hero  nor a villain. The writer may well have summed up Longstreet's Civil War  career in one sentence when he wrote \\". . that Longstreet, though  undeniably talented, was incredibly willful, and his cooperation in  operations of which he did not approve was notoriously poor.\\"<br />The  narration of the Peninsula Campaign and Seven Pines is well worth the price  of the book. Especially interesting is his description of Johnston's  reaction  to Federal transports reaching the mouth of the Pamunkey River  and the Union gunboats ascending the York River following the Confederate  evacuation of Yorktown; a situation Johnson both anticipated and feared.   The author observes that at Seven Pines Johnston \\". . totally abdicated his  responsibility for the overall conduct of the battle when he led Whiting's  division down the Nine Mile Road . .\\" and then makes the interestingly  observation that this was a similar failing of almost all Civil War  commanding generals, Confederate or Union, in their first offensive  battle.<br />The last chapter is an assessment of Johnston's campaign.  Here  the author states that Johnston's retreat from Williamsburg was a skillful  maneuver with strategic insight.  Professor Newton correctly states that  Joseph Johnston did in fact successfully defend Richmond.  In view of the  strategic importance of Richmond in 1862 this was a significant  accomplishment.  The last chapter is insightful and well worth  reading.<br />The lack of a sufficient number of maps is the book's major  shortcoming.	2000-05-12
