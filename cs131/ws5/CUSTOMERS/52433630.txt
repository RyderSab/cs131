I'd heard nothing but wonderful things about this book, and since I'd been disappointed with several other \\"traditional,\\" medically-focused pregnancy books out there, I thought I'd give this one a try. <br /> <br />One thing is for sure -- the book is hilarious. Laugh-out-loud funny! That's its biggest advantage. <br /> <br />It's not a medical book, and doesn't pretend to be. Vicki Iovine pulls no punches, which  is part of the book's humor, but also what I found very off-putting about the book. <br /> <br />Iovine is just as opinionated as every other mother who wants to dispense advice to wide-eyed mothers-to-be like me, and I found her tone increasingly flippant and abrasive. <br /> <br />Many of her philosophies didn't mesh with mine, either. She devotes several pages to flippant \\"reasons\\" (more like excuses) why a pregnant woman shouldn't exercise during pregnancy -- at least, nothing more than brisk walks around the block. She ridicules women who continue with aerobics and weight training through pregnancy, assuming that they all must be impossibly perfect Superwomen, and that if any one of them ever lost a pregnancy, they'd drive themselves crazy wondering if their exercising had anything to do with it. Nice attitude. <br /> <br />She also advocates the occasional alcoholic drink during pregnancy. Granted, I don't think one glass of wine is going to result in fetal alcohol syndrome, but I'd be more worried about that occasional drink doing some harm to my fetus, than I would about 15 reps of bicep curls with a 10-pound dumbbell. <br /> <br />Her musings about how pregnancy ruins your body forever were funny, but suddenly I found myself crying amid my laughter. This book scared the hell out of me. I detect some bitterness in Iovine, despite that great sense of humor. If you're particularly sensitive, or planning a super-healthy, remotely natural/organic pregnancy, this book is not for you.	2005-07-06
US	52433630	RO01VRTHN7C4Y	1400032717	459979615	The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time	Books	3	2	5	N	N	Is this a YA book? It should be. It's a good one.	I think this book is being marketed for adults, which is curious, because it reads like a number of young-adult (YA) novels out there these days. I think teenagers would enjoy this book just as much as adults seem to be enjoying it, and I hope it finds its way into some kids' hands. <br /> <br />The jacket copy bills the book as something of a mystery. I feel this is inaccurate. I found the plot twists pretty transparent (with the exception of one -- the fate of Christopher's mother), and usually I'm awfully thickheaded about these things. As it happened, I wasn't surprised by many of the twists and turns in this book. <br /> <br />The genius of this book is that it is the portrait of a decaying marriage, seen from outside that marriage -- through the eyes of the couple's autistic son, Christopher. The book is really about how Christopher deals with his parents' split -- a split he doesn't even know has occurred. And once he does know, the manner in which he handles this information is very different from dozens of other YA \\"problem novels,\\" because of his autism. <br /> <br />Read in this manner, \\"The Curious Incident...\\" is a pretty interesting, skillfully-written book. Reading it as an exercise in voice and character is missing the point completely.	2004-12-20

I'd been wanting to read this book for a long time before a friend finally gave me a copy for my birthday this year.  <br /> <br />The scope of the book is broader than I expected. I think I was expecting a bunch of funny, sometimes bittersweet stories about anatomy labs and funeral homes. Stiff is much more than that. Yes, it covers anatomy labs (one of my favorite chapters in the book) and funeral homes, but dead bodies go many more places than that -- crash-testing labs, for example. And sometimes into the pharmacopoeia of the dead person's own culture. <br /> <br />Mary Roach's prose is bitingly funny, yet remains sensitive to the topic. There's a lot of gross stuff in here. This is not a book to read while you are eating anything -- especially meat. I initially sat down with this book at a Boston Market with a one-quarter chicken, macaroni & cheese, and broccoli, which was not a good thing to do at all, especially since the opening chapter is about severed human heads being used as facelift refresher surgery. I finished eating first, and then picked up the book again, and was much happier that way. <br /> <br />Also pretty gross is the chapter about human body parts being used as folk medicines. I found that to be possibly the most gross thing in the book, and I generally have a pretty high tolerance for this stuff. <br /> <br />An unexpected part of the book was the research Mary Roach did into up-and-coming body disposal methods -- alternatives to burial and cremation. I found this fascinating, and I'm hoping the Promessa method of composting bodies has received all the necessary go-aheads in the U.S. by the time I die. Just freeze-dry me and grind me up so I can help trees to grow. <br /> <br />The only thing that kept me from giving the book five stars was all the information about transplants and other medical procedures being tested on animals. I know this information was essential in the context of the book, but I can take a lot less grossness if it involves an unwilling animal, as opposed to a human being who willed his or her body to science.	2004-12-19

There are so many of them, and Bittner forges relationships with so many of them, that even though the birds have distinct personalities, I lost track of who was who after a while.  <br /> <br />Also frustrating is Bittner's frustration with himself. He chooses to live on the fringes of society, in an attempt to follow a more spiritual path, but he periodically becomes disenchanted with meditation and communing with nature and loses sight of even his spiritual goals. I knew the book was supposed to include a human love interest, but she doesn't appear until nearly the end of the book. I wished she'd been introduced earlier, and that we were allowed to see more of Bittner's life with her, to provide a happy contrast to the frustration he experience through so much of the book. <br /> <br />The main attraction of the book is, of course, the birds, but they only remain charming for so long. After a while, Bittner's catalog of interactions begins to sound like the transcription of a bird-watcher's journal. I also began wondering just how wonderful his interactions with the birds were -- at times he just plain interfered with nature, and I'm not sure that's such a good thing. <br /> <br />I'm a sucker for an animal story, though, and Bittner's closeness to the flock is enviable. Though the book got overly-long and repetitive, I'd love to see the movie.	2004-11-11

The book seems to be part memoir, part how-to, and doesn't really satisfy as either one. It's too repetitive and not quite in-depth enough to be a good how-to, and it's not quite personal enough to be a memoir. By the time Grobel resorted to interviewing _himself_, I felt the book had wavered so much between memoir and how-to, that the self-interview seemed not only redundant (bringing up many of the same how-to points that had been reiterated throughout the rest of the book) but self-indulgent. <br /> <br />The book feels padded, especially by the interviews with prominent editors and interviewers -- I feel those could have been trimmed even more than they no doubt already were. I think the material in this book could have made a compelling magazine article. As it stands, however, it's a rather lightweight book. <br /> <br />The parts I most enjoyed were the parts that approached memoir. I loved hearing about Grobel's personal reactions to, and opinions of, big-name celebrities. I loved hearing stories about battling recalcitrant publicists. I appreciated the bits of personal information, such as Grobel's initial desire to be a novelist. Maybe there _is_ a memoir inside Grobel. If he ever writes it, I'll read it, because the scraps of information he throws in \\"The Art of the Interview\\" are fascinating.	2004-10-30

He's like a Douglas Coupland character, come to life. He spends extravagant amounts of money ($700 for a pair of sunglasses, a blithe layout of $900 in cash for the psycho cleaning lady) with hardly an eyeblink and, in another page or three, just as breezily mentions that he's broke. He's obsessed with packaging, advertising, and glitz, and he knows it.  <br /> <br />He was a functioning alcoholic with a high-powered job for years, and though he's dry now, he's got other stuff going on -- real _issues_ -- that aren't going to just go away. How does a person this messed up get through a day? Read MAGICAL THINKING to find out. You might not come away from it loving Augusten Burroughs, or even wanting to pat him on the head and tell him everything's OK, but that might just be fine with him. It's clear from some of the stories in this book that Burroughs has  messed himself up enough times with big expectations and delusions of grandeur (the Tang commercial, the fantasy about the Vanderbilts) to know exactly what he's doing when he gets going with the \\"magical thinking.\\" How many of us know ourselves this well?	2004-10-20

A Disappointment All Around.	While Feinberg makes good points about the seemingly high number of \\"problem books\\" in YA literature, and the need for giving the right child the right book at the right time, her argument continually circles back to what books she might have liked or needed when she was a child -- which is irrelevant. She's done her growing up already. <br /> <br />Yes, there are a lot of \\"problem\\" books these days. It's a trend, and one that will eventually give way to another trend. That new trend will have its censors as well. While I agree with Feinberg in her criticism of some highly-regarded (indeed, Newbery award-winning) books, her criticism rings hollow when one considers that her own book pulls the exact same sort of emotional-whammy trick as the YA books she's criticizing. I'm talking, of course, about how the focus of her book changes very abruptly, from YA literature and her children's storytelling class -- to her daughter's illness. <br /> <br />Feinberg's daughter's illness seems to have been the real impetus for writing a book. I think the book should have focused more on that, rather than having been packaged as a book about imagination and YA literature. <br /> <br />An unfocused, neurotic mishmash.	2004-10-11

Holling's Paddle-to-the-Sea, the story of a carved toy canoe that, over the course of several years, makes its way from the north shore of Lake Superior, through the Great Lakes, out the St. Lawrence river and, finally, to the Atlantic. Kind strangers aid the canoe's perilous journey and, in the happiest of eventualities, the man who was once the boy who carved the canoe learns of its progress. <br /> <br />Cork Boat, a recounting of John Pollack's lifelong endeavor to build and launch a boat made entirely of wine corks, tells a similar tale of individual determination, a supportive community, and sheer serendipity. <br /> <br />Pollack first turned boatwright at age six, building a craft from orange crates and firewood. It went straight to the bottom of the marsh at the end of the Pollacks' street. Undaunted, he decided then and there that his next boat would be made out of corks. His parents began saving corks, and thus the Cork Boat project began. <br /> <br />By 1999, Pollack was in his 30s, disillusioned with his career as a Capitol Hill speechwriter, and ready to chuck it all in order to devote himself to building his cork boat. At the time, his parents' cork collection topped 3,000. Some quick calculations revealed that Pollack would need at least 60,000. <br /> <br />He quit his job, kicked cork collection into high gear, and took on a partner - a young architect named Garth Goldstein, who soon upped the estimated number of corks needed to 100,000 (the completed boat would actually top out at 165,321 corks). Design work began in earnest, and design solutions (a hexagonal \\"disk\\" of corks held together by rubber bands) were stumbled upon entirely by accident. <br /> <br />One by one, difficulties mounted and were surmounted by Pollack and Goldstein's creative thinking, personal connections, determination, and charm. When Washington restaurants and bars failed to come through with the corks they promised to save from the millennium New Year bash, Pollack secured a corporate sponsor - a cork manufacturer who donated tens of thousands of corks. When the completed boat was found to be too large to fit on the boat trailer hired to take it to its launch site, Pollack and Goldstein bought 10 furniture dollies, strapped them to the bottom of the boat, and hired a tow truck to take the craft to the marina.  <br /> <br />Not even the horror of September 11, 2001 could sink the dream of the Cork Boat. Though Pollack was certain that none of his volunteers would want to think of something so frivolous in the days after the attack, the opposite was true - volunteers came flooding back because the boat was frivolous. After 9/11, many people were looking for hope wherever they could find it, and the Cork Boat was a hopeful project. <br /> <br />When Pollack's corporate cork sponsor proposed a voyage down Portugal's Douro River, the whole world took notice - everyone from major news networks to the most modest Portuguese villagers. Everyone was determined that the Cork Boat should succeed in winding its way through the Douro to the Atlantic, offering tips for outsmarting customs officers, and tows when the current was too forceful to row against. <br /> <br />Pollack acknowledges that the Cork Boat will probably never sail again. The magic of its trip down the Douro came from the fact that the boat was so unique -- it's sort of a \\"been there, done that\\" approach. The story of the Cork Boat, recounted in this book, is an exciting, amazing testament to Pollack's vision and the power of community. Definitely worth reading.	2004-10-10

Grealy's recounting of her childhood battle with a serious form of cancer and the years of reconstructive surgery that follows is at once introspective and detached.     I agree with some of the other reviewers who said they felt Grealy was revealing only what she wanted the reader to know -- that there's more to this story than what she included here. While I found this intriguing and slightly frustrating, I did not feel cheated. Had Grealy lived, there might have been other books that focused on other aspects of her illness and surgeries -- how it affected her family's daily life, her relationships with her siblings (especially her twin sister), and so on. Issues that were only touched upon in this book, but which could have formed the thematic basis for several subsequent memoirs.     Though I was a little disappointed not to have been given more information about those things in this book, I realize that the title of the book is \\"Autobiography of a Face,\\" and the focus of the book is exactly that -- this the story of Lucy Grealy's face, and \\"how it got that way.\\" While her careful honing and focusing of the book's contents did leave me slightly dissatisfied because of all the other things I wanted to know, I can't deny what looks like a marvelous job of Grealy remaining true to her intended subject.    I must confess, I'm looking forward to reading Ann Patchett's \\"Truth and Beauty,\\" which allegedly offers a look at Lucy Grealy that differs from what Grealy allows us in her own book.	2004-09-25

By now, many of us have read books, seen movies, and heard stories about extraordinary survival won through that extraordinary horror, the Holocaust. This book stands with the best of those stories because of its uniqueness -- seven of the 10 Ovitzes were dwarfs, and therefore the entire family became the special \\"pets\\" of the dreaded Dr. Mengele. <br /> <br />The writing is hardly slick or seamless, but it gets the job done in a more than satisfactory manner. The text seems to speak English with an accent, and while that can be a tad distracting at times, it confers that much more veracity upon the story of the Ovitzes. <br /> <br />The resourcefulness, dedication, and intelligence of the Ovitz dwarfs enables the reader to see them as much more than medical curiosities. Not only are they real people, they're very special people. Frankly, people of this caliber would be worth writing a book about even if they were of normal stature. Dwarfism aside, the story of the Ovitzes is that of a loving, close-knit, traditional family of a type that seems sadly alien to many of us today.  <br /> <br />The family's Jewish faith remains strong even in the face of growing persecution. When it is decreed that Jewish performers may perform only for Jewish audiences, the Ovitzes skillfully contrive to obtain identification papers that do not identify them as Jews, yet they remain observant by conveniently falling ill on every sabbath, so they do not have to perform. Later, when they are held in the concentration camp, they manage to say prayers and fashion makeshift candles in secret observance of holidays. <br /> <br />The suffering the Ovitzes endured at the hands of Mengele is not related in excruciating detail, but what information we are given is excruciating enough. This book is generally more vague, more poetic about the concentration-camp atrocities than other books, but it is no less horrifying. <br /> <br />Horrifying, too, are some of the details of the Ovitzes' lives after the war. They remain devoted to one another, and continue to stick together, but now they are also bonded by what haunts them. Their nephew -- who was only a baby in the camp and learned to call Mengele \\"Daddy\\" so that he might be spared from torture -- recalls being awakened frequently by his aunts and uncles screaming in their sleep. <br /> <br />One of the most interesting aspects of this book are the conflicting accounts of the dwarfs' activities in the concentration camp. Several witnesses claim to have seen the Ovitzes performing in the camp, whereas the Ovitzes always firmly maintained that they did not perform -- and indeed, would not have done such a thing. Other witnesses claim to have seen several of the dwarves kowtowing to Mengele and to have heard them praising him to the other prisoners. The Ovitzes deny this as well.  <br /> <br />The authors of the book do not attempt to clear up these discrepancies; they simply present both sides, and acknowledge that perhaps certain people's memories are clouded or inaccurate. I admired this tactic. <br /> <br />This remarkable family made their way in a world that gave them very little more than sharp minds, winning personalities, each other, and their strong faith. Though they did gain wealth and widespread renown before and after the war, during the very darkest years of their lives, the barest essentials -- wits and wit, family and faith -- turned out to be riches in themselves.	2004-09-23

The title alone was enough to make me pull the book off the shelf, but when I saw that the subtitle was --  \\"A Survival Guide for the Recently Unemployed\\" -- I thought, \\"Well, that sure is me! And I could use some advice on how to land on the right side of my you-know-what.\\" <br /> <br />I read half of this engaging how-to book right there in the library. I couldn't put it down. Author Michael Laskoff uses irreverent humor (almost like that of the Motley Fool investment books, except slightly edgier) to deliver his very practical, sound, time-tested advice on how to survive -- and bounce back from -- \\"employment separation.\\" <br /> <br />In this book, you'll find realistic, can-do methods of handling the news of your sacking, how to deal with the emotions it engenders, how to break the news to your loved ones, what to do in the first few days after being fired (hint: have fun!), how to organize a daily schedule for your unemployed self, and how to reenter the workforce  -- from writing a resume and cover letter, to conducting inital research and networking, right on up through negotiating a job offer. <br /> <br />The chapter on networking was especially helpful to me. When I reached that point and saw the kind of information Laskoff was offering, I said to myself, \\"I'm checking this book out of the library so I can make notes at home!\\" Nothing else I've ever read or heard has spelled out networking so completely and made it sound like SOMETHING I CAN TRULY DO.  Laskoff tells you exactly how to go about it.  No mystery whatsoever.  <br /> <br />The engaging voice and priceless information is marred only by the dreadful copyediting job somebody did (or, perhaps more correctly, didn't do) on this book. Misspellings, errors in usage and style inconsistencies plague the text. Surely Three Rivers Press, which is a division of Crown -- which is a division of Random House! -- can do better. <br /><br />Thanks, Mr. Laskoff. I needed this book, and not a moment too soon.	2004-09-15

She runs with a shallow crowd and is getting tired of them. <br /> <br />Enter Danny, this book's version of \\"Spaz.\\" He's a loner who wears thrift-store clothes, lives with his aunt who has MS, and works at a dog shelter. While he's darker and not as charming as the \\"Spaz\\" from \\"Stoner and Spaz,\\" he's sufficiently intriguing and helps Margaux find out who she is, apart from her ditzy friends. Danny's sick aunt also gives Margaux some of the tools she needs to confront her irresponsible parents, who are little more than a career gambler and a TV addict. <br /> <br />Margaux, in turn, doesn't desert Danny when he shows her a sinister side of himself.

Other Amazon reviewers have complained about the lack of characterization, but I didn't have this problem. Cley (the Physiognomist who goes from antihero to hero during the course of the book) is certainly a complete character, and I felt there was certainly enough of the Master, Arla, and the Traveler to go around. If the denizens of the Territory seem like caricatures to us, that's because that's how Cley views them -- they seem subhuman and worthless to him. <br /> <br />The story is relentless. Jeffrey Ford wastes no time in moving the plot along, yet I never felt he skimped on any necessary detail.  He is nothing short of a genius of a writer. Highly original, exquisitely conscious of every word, moving along at a breakneck pace yet giving the reader everything he or she needs to enjoy the ride. I didn't want this book to end! <br /> <br />This is basically a dystopian novel, in which Physiognomist Cley, an exalted servant under the tyrannical Master of the Well-Built City, is sent to a crummy village to examine the locals using the Physiognomy. <br /> <br />The Physiognomy involves taking measures of people's facial features and body parts to determine their character and their worth to society. Cley is acknowledged as a master of this dubious science. Cley, who is in trouble with the Master, has been sent to the village as a punishment. It's a crummy assignment, and Cley knows it.  <br /> <br />He is there, however, to try to catch a thief. Someone has stolen the valuable Fruit of Paradise, and Cley must use the Physiognomy to determine the culprit and regain the fruit. <br /> <br />This is only the beginning, however. Where another writer would have made this the point of an entire book, Jeffrey Ford explodes the idea and takes it farther than I ever imagined.  <br /> <br />The thief is discovered, but the whimsical Master has decided Cley needs to be takenout of the picture. He is arrested and sentenced to hard labor in the sulphur mines, where he is looked after by the mysterious Matters brothers (Cley wonders -- are there really two brothers? or just one man pretending to be both?) and a superintelligent monkey (one of my favorite characters in the book). <br /> <br />The Master apparently reconsiders his treatment of Cley, and calls him back to the Well-Built City. The Master needs Cley's help desperately -- he's losing control of the City and needs an ally. By this time, however, Cley is a changed man who wants only to gain the trust and love of a woman he severely wronged back in the village. \\"Wronged\\" is too mild a word -- he used his Physiognomist knowledge to surgically rearrange her face so that now, one look at her can kill a man. <br /> <br />I admit, there were a couple of weak moments toward the end (there's a save-the-day moment involving a coach-and-four that seems a little too \\"Hollywood\\" and the manner in which the \\"crystal egg\\" finally breaks is also a little over-the-top), but these are mere trifles.  <br /> <br />The Physiognomy is a gripping, finely-wrought book. I can't wait to read the sequels. And, for that matter, everything else Jeffrey Ford has written.	2004-08-28

This \\"history of magic\\" seemed to me little more than a jumble of results from the author's no-doubt extensive research and experience.  <br /> <br />The format is kind of a mess. I got worried when I saw the little oval pictures and bio information of the various magicians listed in the front -- \\"He's lumping a lot of basic info up front, in this 'cast of characters,'\\" I thought. \\"I bet the structure of this book is going to be all over the place. This does not bode well.\\" <br /> <br />Boy, was I right. The chapters progress in no apparent order, and the titles and epigraphs can seem arbitrary. A chapter that begins with the picture of Georges Melies, with a quotation from this pioneer of visual special effects, ends up not being about Melies. A chapter titled \\"Houdini\\" opens with several pages about Charles Morritt. The reason for this becomes clear later, but a reader would have been better served by just cutting to the chase.  <br /> <br />Speaking of Houdini, I'm a big Houdini fan, and I was intrigued and amused by what a trouncing he takes in this book. I knew he was regarded as a poor stage magician, but the extent to which he is reviled in this book was very interesting indeed. I enjoyed reading about one of my idols from this very different point of view. <br /> <br />But -- why on earth is the information about Houdini (and nearly every other magician in the book) spread across three chapters? Not even _consecutive_ chapters. The structure of this book really is inscrutable, and all the little oval pictures in the world won't help that. It's too bad, because the drawings of the magicians really are well-done -- arresting in black and white. <br /> <br />The writing was kind of a drag. I'm a fast reader, but it took me almost a month to get through this book, because I kept putting it down and having to force myself to pick it up again.  <br /> <br />As for the explanations of thetricks, I still don't understand anything. I'm not given to quick, intuitive understanding of mechanical things, and I believe a successful book that was going to expose the secrets of magical illusions would do so in a way that was accessible to _any_ reader. I have a feeling this book is for readers who are already somewhat \\"in the know\\" about stage magic. The secrets of Morritt, Kellar, Maskelyne, Devant, and others are still safe with me; I simply didn't understand any of them.	2004-08-16

A page-turner	As someone who has had a lifelong fascination with death, decomposition, murder, funerary and burial practices, and all manner of morbid stuff, I was eager to read &quot;Death's Acre.&quot; I had read a little about the Body Farm previously, so I couldn't wait to get the whole story from the man who started it all, Bill Bass. <br />  <br /> I expected the book to focus very narrowly on the Body Farm itself, but that isn't the case. The reader does get information about Bass's background and how he got into anthropology -- and then forensics -- in the first place. This moves into logical background about Bass's initial work with corpses and the eventual founding of the Body Farm. I thought it was interesting that the Farm got started not only as a much-needed research facility for learning about an uncharted area of science, but it also seemed to have been started because Bass was running out of place to store messy dead bodies (a broom closet at the university and even the trunk of his beloved Mustang proved to be not the best places after all!). <br />  <br /> The book then gets into some of the difficulties the Farm has had -- protests about its location, protests about the use of unclaimed cadavers (particularly those of U.S. veterans) and some of the projects it has hosted (including an adipocere formation experiment and an experiment suggested by crime author Patricia Cornwell). <br />  <br /> But most of what comprises this book are stories about Bass's career -- his failures and successes. The failures (most notably the Shy case) point up the need for a facility like the Body Farm, and the successes point to the value of the data gathered at the site. All the workers at the Body Farm -- living and dead -- are doing a great deal to aid forensic science. In the future, justice for murder victims will be served more swiftly and accurately because of the work done at the Body Farm. <br />  <br /> Avid readers of true crime will enjoy the specialized &quot;professional&quot; view of cases that may already be familiar to them. I was familiar with the Madison Rutherford and Perry/Rubinstein cases, but getting the technical details from Bass (shaped for maximum readability by his capable co-author Jon Jefferson) gave the stories a new dimension. Especially fascinating was the description of the study Bass's student made of the effects of differents types of saws upon bone, which helped lead to a conviction in the death of Leslie Mahaffey, one of the victims of the diabolical Paul Bernardo, the male half of the Canadian &quot;Barbie and Ken&quot; husband-and-wife murder team. There's also an inside look at the infamous Tri-State Crematory case from 2002. <br />  <br /> There's a lot of eye-popping detail in this book, some of it horrifying, some of it poignant, some of it -- dare I say -- hilarious. See if you can keep yourself from laughing when you find out why Bass had to buy his first wife two new kitchen stoves, or why he had to buy his third wife a new blender.  <br />  <br /> Even when the tone of the book becomes humorous, Bass is always professional and respectful. Bass sees himself as a scientist, first and foremost, and his ultimate goal is to use his science to bring criminals to justice. He's humble, big-hearted, and always willing to learn from anybody -- be it a colleague, one of his own students, or the voiceless dead who speak to him with their inert, shattered bones. <br />	2004-07-24

Where's the new stuff?&quot; <br />  <br /> Plath fans like myself, who've read every biography and scrutinized every poem, need to hang in there for a bit. It takes a while to tap the riches in this book, but once you hit pay dirt, you'll be buried in it. You can expect nothing less from Diane Middlebrook's exhaustive research and crisp, yet sensitive writing. <br />  <br /> The book is essentially a biography of Ted Hughes, but it is a biography of Hughes in relation to Plath -- possibly the only kind of biography that could ever be written about Ted Hughes.  <br />  <br /> Middlebrook takes what has been said over and over about Hughes and Plath -- that they were larger-than-life, highly charismatic, very intense people -- and digs deep with research and literary analysis. The result is two fully-fleshed mythical figures, with the history of -- and reasons for -- the shaping of their mythic status. <br />  <br /> Speaking of the literary analysis, it is incredibly detailed, dissected to a dizzying extent. Middlebrook is quite a scholar, and makes bold connections between various Plath and Hughes poems (some of which were written on opposite sides of the same piece of paper -- a practice Middlebrook calls Plath & Hughes's &quot;hand-to-hand combat&quot;). The poems take on squirming new life in the illumination Middlebrook provides.  <br />  <br /> Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes were complex, inscrutable people. They believed their relationship was fated, and that indeed seems to have been the case. They goaded each other to produce writing that was better and more unique than anything else being written at the time. The destruction of their marriage was the catalyst for Plath's final poems, the ones that would guarantee her immortality.  <br />  <br /> It's hard to know how to feel about Ted Hughes. I have a lot more interest in, and respsect for, him after reading this book. One thing is certain -- he is the only man who could have endured life in the shadow of Sylvia Plath. A hunter, a creator of myths, only his questing, questioning nature could have been strong enough to stand up to all Plath threw at him, in life and in death.	2004-07-23

The photos did not reproduce well (not even the recent photos!) and some of the design choices (like the circles that highlight details on the various gowns) have no value from an editorial or visual standpoint.  <br />There are many years that are represented by only three or four gowns -- even recent years! Surely there have been more standouts than that? I expected this book to be a feast for the eyes, an endless parade of gowns ranging from elegant to outrageous, but the pickings are indeed slim.<br />I thought there were some grievous omissions, but I couldn't put my finger on what, or whom. Geena Davis now comes to mind -- love her or hate her, there's no denying the fact that the statuesque form of this six-footer is hard to ignore. Why isn't she represented anywhere? Why not more about men's fashion? Why not more profiles of designers, a closer look at Oscar-night jewelry and how it's loaned out, even a spread or two of how one actress's Oscar fashions progressed throughout the years? The scope of this book isn't terribly imaginative or (as the title proclaims) complete.<br />The writing is awful. This isn't really the sort of book you pick up for the writing anyway but, seeing as how the pictures weren't even that good, I ended up reading the little blurbs of writing and found them full of clunky, poor word choices and bad jokes.<br />Speaking of bad jokes, yes, we all know Cher can be wacky. We've all seen her black zigzag outfit with the crazy rooster headdress a million times already. Is there any reason for no fewer than THREE photos of this godforsaken getup to appear in this book? Especially since the author repeatedly expresses a dislike of it? Making fun of Cher's sequinned rooster outfit is nothing new; it's been done to death, and by funnier, more articulate people than this author. We didn't need more of it in this book.<br />Just show us more pictures of beautiful gowns!	2004-07-19
US	52433630	R1FUH26C9PL2XQ	0060171847	679653277	In Nonna's Kitchen: Recipes and Traditions from Italy's Grandmothers	Books	5	17	20	N	N	Delicious and Delightful	This is the second of Carol Field's books that I've read (the first one I picked up was &quot;Celebrating Italy&quot;) and her hallmarks seem to be meticulous, yet loving, research and a writing style that manages to evoke the sights, sounds, smells, textures, and flavors of Italian cooking to a mouth-watering degree. <br />&quot;In Nonna's Kitchen&quot; is a cookbook that Field researched by going to Italy and culling time-honored, taste-tested recipes from several authentic Italian grandmothers. I have not yet tried any of the recipes, but reading them feels like good eatin'. I usually dislike cookbooks that don't feature a picture of every recipe. &quot;In Nonna's Kitchen&quot; contains no pictures of food, but the recipes and Field's writing on Italian cuisine and culture make pictures unnecessary.<br />Ah, yes, culture. It's easy to see Field not so much as a food writer, but as an eager and loving student of Italian culture. She does much honor to the Italian grandmothers who contributed to this book by providing a lengthy, colorful profile of each of them. In these profiles, the  &quot;nonne&quot; discuss how they learned to cook, what their lives have been like, how cooking has changed over the courses of their lifetimes, etc. In addition to these formal profiles, Field includes little anecdotes about several of the grandmothers within the recipes they provided.<br />These are not your stereotypical black-shawled, muttering Italian grandmothers, either. They range in age from 40s-90s, and a good many of them are classically beautiful, stylish women. All of them, however, are quintessentially Italian in that they place great importance on good, simple food made from the freshest local ingredients.<br />I plan to buy copies of &quot;In Nonna's Kitchen&quot; and &quot;Celebrating Italy&quot; for myself; they're too good not to own. Carol Field now has the distinction of being my favorite food writer!	2004-05-13

I read this book on a recommendation from a casual acquaintance and, despite the book's slow start, I'm glad I hung in there and gave it a chance.<br />The beginning of the book shows Annie Hawes and her sister being swept along by the customs of daily Ligurian life. They bumble around amiably, and before long, they find themselves buying a broken-down house. <br />The book starts to get interesting once the women are settled in the house and begin to cultivate relationships with the townspeople, Ligurian peasants who are charming and maddening by turns. Much is made of farming and food -- particularly the growing of olives and the process by which olive oil is made. <br />The sisters' house is up a treacherous pathway, and we're told stories of years' worth of struggle to find a decent car, build a staircase connecting the floors of the house, hook up running water. These stories are told not with  &quot;money pit&quot;-like out-and-out humor, but with a lightheartedness and a unique respect for preserving the rustic condition and context of the sisters' home.<br />Even after the women have been living in Liguria for years, they are still regarded somewhat as _stranieri_, strangers, foreigners with odd ways. Yet they are trusted enough to be welcomed into homes all over the village. They learn the ways of the &quot;hanky-headed&quot; olive-farming men and get used to being mourned over for not having any husbands to work in the fields for them. <br />The book takes place over a long period of time and, in that expanse, we see the Ligurian village go from a backwater to a flourishing center of olive oil production. We see Italian politics change, though not easily. We see the womens' friends grow old, move on, pass away. <br />The dry English humor (I loved the Capital Letters that another reviewer found annoying) and heartfelt storytelling made me feel as though I had been welcomed into the village.	2004-04-26
US	52433630	RADAA8VOEFWJ9	0312287658	394382110	Under the Southern Sun: Stories of the Real Italy and the Americans It Created	Books	4	26	26	N	N	Stereotypes Step Aside to Reveal Pure Italy	This eminently readable book -- part Italian history, part personal journal -- dissects the economic and social constructs of the Southern part of Italy in an attempt to understand what it truly means to be Southern Italian and why Southern Italians have gotten such a bad rap in Italy and the U.S.<br />The author is proudly of Southern Italian descent, and it seems he has a bone to pick. I can certainly understand that -- I am of Southern Italian descent myself, and no stranger to the stereotypes that exist about &quot;my people&quot; -- the mafioso, the ignorant peasant, the shiftless ne'er do well. <br />The colorful anecdotes in this book do a good job of shattering those stereotypes. Statistics about organized crime and the actual activities of the Mafia seem to show that Italians are not the leaders of the crime world. The apparent &quot;laziness&quot; is actually a social custom, akin to the Mexican siesta, that carried over to the United States, where nobody understood that it was actually a good idea to rest from one's labors during the hottest part of the day.<br />As for the ignorant peasant claim, yes, the people of the South are not as formally educated as those of the North. But what they lack in book-learning, they make up for in common sense, hard physical work, and heart. They are people of high ideals and close families, and it was ideals (a desire to better their families' lot in life) as well as an unsympathetic government that sparked the mass migration from Southern Italy to the U.S. in the late 1800s and early 1900s.<br />I have no reason to doubt this author's research; I certainly haven't done any of my own that disputes it. But I did get a distinct &quot;bone-picking&quot; feeling from this book that put me off a little bit. That feeling is the only reason why I didn't give the book five stars.<br />Overall, however, the book is pure Italy -- a love of life, and thankfulness for what it brings. As the author travels through Southern Italy, the people he meets and the stories he hears paint clear, enlightening pictures of this mysterious and misunderstood land.<br />I especially loved the (true) story &quot;U Figlio di Giovanni,&quot; about a young man who discovers that his father is nothing short of a hero in his home village. I also loved the fact that the author finds his last name popping up all over Southern Italy during his travels. People respond to his name instantly: &quot;That is a name from here. You have a face from here. You are our family.&quot; Doors and hearts open, purely on the basis of a familiar -- and therefore trusted and honored -- name. <br />This book is wonderful, engaging reading for anyone interested in Italian culture, Italian heritage, or searches for identity. It also evokes Italy very clearly, even for someone like me, who's only spent seven days there. I plan to read this book again!	2004-04-14

The breakdown of her marriage is sketched for the reader, rather than drawn out in excruciating detail, but that sketch is evocative and, indeed, excruciating anyway. It's very clear to the reader what Reichl is giving up, and how hard it is for her to make the decision to give it up. <br />Also palpable, though never stated outright, is her bemusement at being swept into the L.A. food world of celebrity chefs and movie stars. Perhaps that feeling comes from having read Tender At the Bone.<br />The part of Comfort Me With Apples that will stay with me the longest is the part about Reichl's adopted daughter, Gavi. I can't imagine withstanding a loss like that. Indeed, I had no idea there was any such thing in Reichl's life. She tells the story of her daughter with the awe-inspiring level of self-knowledge that seems to be a characteristic of her memoirs. <br />Ruth Reichl knows food, but Ruth Reichl also knows herself -- every strength and weakness, every grace and meanness -- and she's not afraid to show us each aspect of her personality.	2004-04-07

I found it self-absorbed and opaque, inscrutable. Grizzuti Harrison's Italy sounds like a place I would never want to go -- indeed, nothing like the place I've been to -- full of peevish storekeepers, American-hating townspeople, predatory men. I found nothing to love about the Italy depicted in this book and couldn't imagine why the author would subject herself to further months spent there. <br />The writing is very strange. The sentence structure loops archaically, and the asides that are often inserted into the sentences not only make the reading more difficult, but do nothing to enlighten the reader.<br />I also took issue with the book's tone and diction. Grizzuti Harrison spends pages and pages on high-flown quotations -- so many that it seems like she's padding her book because she has no thoughts of her own -- yet brings the reader crashing down from these utterances with a few strangely-placed &quot;f-words.&quot;<br />I didn't understand this book. I prefer my own memories of Italy to this author's.	2004-04-05

I've always liked Judith Viorst's wry voice that seems to capture children's unsure moments so perfectly, and \\"...Barney\\" has a lot of that. <br />The particular details of the story are even good -- I love that the boy's mother wraps Barney in a piece of cloth before they bury him. I love that the boy's best friend attends the funeral to hear him recite the nine best things about Barney. I love the little argument they have after the funeral, about whether Barney is really in heaven, or if he's just in the ground.<br />But the book takes a jarring twist when the boy decides what the 10th good thing about Barney is. The 10th good thing is basically that Barney is dead and rotting. OK, OK -- dead and rotting and therefore helping flowers to grow. Life will come from his death, and yes, that is the message. <br />But really. Basically the 10th good thing about Barney is that he's dead and rotting. I'm a fairly morbid person, very interested in the process of death and decomposition, but I think the ending of this story is too morbid to present to young children at the end of this otherwise sweet, sentimental story. It doesn't seem to fit.	2004-02-10

This short text by playwright Eugene O'Neill is written from the point of view of his dog, Blemie. With quiet eloquence and dignity, Blemie considers the approaching eventuality of his own death and its effect on his beloved Master and Mistress. <br />He remarks that dogs do not fear death, as humans do, and offers other words of canine comfort related to grieving (&quot;It is painful for me to think that even in death I should cause them pain.&quot;) and the possibility of getting a new dog -- a prospect Blemie endorses (&quot;It would be a poor tribute to my memory never to have a dog again.&quot;).<br />This tiny book, written in the voice of a beloved pet, says everything that needs to be said to a Master or Mistress who is mourning the loss of their dearest friend. <br />The only thing that kept me from giving the book five stars was the tangentially-related illustrations -- dull, unappealing quilts with photographic transfers of dogs stitched into their centers. Certainly, this lovely text could be heightened by beautiful, relevant illustrations. Unfortunately, this edition offers no such thing. <br />The text rises above the odd choice of illustration, however. This book is perfect for anyone who loves their companion animal(s).	2004-02-05

This picture book presents the life and death of a family pet truthfully, responsibly, and in a manner that its intended audience can understand.<br />Jack is adopted from a shelter when he's eight years old. The young narrator points out, \\"That's fifty-six in dog years.\\"   Later on, when the narrator turns 8 himself, he realizes Jack is now 91 in dog years. The concept of \\"dog years\\" will be a tough one to explain to very young children, but just hearing that the narrator has a 91-year-old dog will probably be enough to make them understand that this is a dog who's lived a very long life.<br />And it's a good, happy life as well. Jack is played with, taken trick-or-treating, taken on family vacations complete with romps on the beach -- and he's always shown wearing a collar with ID and rabies vaccination tags, a responsible touch that I appreciated.<br />The text has a light touch without sugarcoating anything. The pictures of old, tired Jack might be a little upsetting to a sensitive child -- I know sad, tired doggie eyes get me every time.<br />In general, however, this book's straightforward yet warm approach makes it a good choice for families looking for books that can help them deal with the pain of losing a pet.	2004-02-04

I first read WUTHERING HEIGHTS as an assignment in 10th grade English class and was struck by how emotionally twisted the characters were. I also wondered if I was reading the book the right way, because I found a lot of the story very funny.<br />So I decided to pick it up again recently and realized what a timeless, brilliant book WUTHERING HEIGHTS really is. It's as emotional and labyrinthine as any soap opera -- but so much more worthwhile. These are some of the most strongly-drawn characters in literature, and they will pull you right into the story with their caprices, turnabouts, fripperies, and cruelty.<br />First-time readers may find the beginning a bit slow, but please don't be discouraged by that.  A really wild, romantic -- and, yes, after all these years, still pretty hilarious -- story awaits you. This is a book that can move you to tears and make you laugh out loud.<br />First-time readers may also have trouble keeping track of the two Catherines and who's married to/in love with whom. Even while rereading it, I had to remind myself who was who, who's the child of whom, who's the mortal enemy of whom -- but it is absolutely worth it. So many people go on about how romantic this book is, and it certainly is, but let's not overlook the sheer drama and insanity of this book.<br />This book is more about obsession than pure romantic love. There, I've said it. This book will make you glad that your life is not like this. But any time you need a shot of histrionic behavior and violent obsession, Heathcliff and Cathy are waiting for you at WUTHERING HEIGHTS.	2004-01-31

It's a sensitive, keenly-felt novel -- that's the part you can believe in. But then it falls apart into a cliche or two, a disappointment here or there, and you realize it's not the Perfect Novel the hype would have you believe it is.<br />Which is not to say this isn't an excellent book. The first half of it alone is enough to make me apply the word &quot;masterpiece.&quot;  The voice of the dead teenaged narrator is achingly lovely and the bittersweet, wistful-and- accepting by turns tone walks such a fine line, and so skillfully, I practically held my breath as I read. I especially loved the narrator's descriptions of what her personal heaven is like. I kept thinking to myself that Alice Sebold was doing the impossible. I couldn't imagine that she'd be able to sustain this mesmerizing, delicate voice and tone for the entire book.<br />And she doesn't. About halfway through, there's a shift, and some characters make decisions that seemed cliched (the mother and the detective, for example). I also found the ending unsatisfying, with regard to what happens to the narrator's murderer, but that's just me. The ending is certainly realistic, and I can see that it would satisfy many other readers.<br />But these are trifles when you consider the tremendous achievement of the first half of the book. THE LOVELY BONES is worth a whole lot of the vast amount of hype it has gotten.	2004-01-31

I'd heard good things about this book, so I was willing to give it a try even though I was less than impressed with the same author's vampire novel, Thirsty. <br />Feed, however, deserved all its buzz, plus more. This book is a piece of brilliance. In this dystopian novel, you'll hear echoes of Holden Caulfield, as well as bits of Minority Report and language worthy of writers like Douglas Coupland and Francesca Lia Block, but M.T. Anderson still creates a world that is at once unique and frighteningly familiar.<br />The invented slang and the culture from which it has sprung are pitch-perfect, and the tone of the writing rides a fine line between absurdly funny and darkly horrifying. The futuristic world described in the book is exhausting, sickening, ridiculous, seductive and brokenly beautiful. The fact that it is, more or less, the world we live in today, makes this the most terrifying book I've read since Margaret Atwood's &quot;The Handmaid's Tale.&quot;<br />This book is for people who like to think and who are willing to examine their lives. Such people -- no matter how young they are -- will be able to handle the occasional curse word that pops up in the book. <br />I couldn't put this book down. It's a fast read, and worth rereading.

It isn't so much about \\"the power of words\\" and choosing one's words carefully, as it is about not jumping to conclusions and the destructive power of rumors. It's a message _related_ to \\"the power of words,\\" sure,  but if Madonna is so bent on teaching lessons, shouldn't somebody be taking care to make sure the flap copy is more accurate about what lesson is being taught?<br />Lessons in children's books = argh.<br />Apart from that, the parenthetical asides have got to go. The repetition isn't cute and isn't working. The tone shifts (\\"Mr. Funkadeli\\"?) have really got to go. Also, the two separate characters of Tommy and Billy aren't needed. A real writer would have had all the conflict come through Billy.<br />OK. Nitpicking over. <br />If one can overlook its flaws, this is a simple story with characters that are more satisfying than the ones in Madonna's last book. Gentle, reasonable Mr. Peabody is especially appealing. The way in which the Message is delivered -- with a pillowcase full of feathers -- is memorable and not embarrassingly heavy-handed. <br />The real star of this book, however, is Loren Long, the illustrator who didn't get so much as a cover credit.  Mr. Long's vivid paintings, with their deep shadows and nostalgic light, perfectly capture the story's small-town setting.  <br />If Madonna keeps on her current course, by the time her children's-book-writing contract is up, she may yet turn out a book I can get behind. And that would be something. Until then, I'll enjoy looking at the pictures.	2003-11-13

Her sometimes Parkeresque wit (that's a compliment) keeps this collection of essays jogging briskly along; I was never bored, even as she talked about Gettysburg and voting booths and the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library. <br />She's more than just funny. She's smart. Sharp. She's the best kind of nerd -- one who can see a broader view of her interests, and not just the minutiae that make nerds nerds. She knows her stuff, and knows it so well that she can wrap an unexpected metaphor around it and you still &quot;get&quot; it. (Elvis, anyone?) <br />The forms of the essays are varied -- in addition to many traditional essays, there are at least two in letter-format, and one Larry King-like list -- which helps to pull the reader through the book. Her studied tangents and &quot;soft&quot; endings that never preach make this a very palatable book for &quot;sunshine patriots&quot; like myself. <br />You'll laugh, you'll think, you'll go back for more. Give this book a try, even if essays aren't your thing. Even if government isn't your thing. You'll learn a thing or two and you'll enjoy it.	2003-11-05

I love love love them. I've been listening to their music for more than 15 years, and it's been very exciting to hear their music evolve over that time. <br />Their foray into the world of children's entertainment has been exciting for me, since I'm a children's-book junkie. But while I think the \\"No!\\" family CD hits the mark, the Johns' \\"children's book,\\" \\"Bed Bed Bed\\" is a bit off. <br />The design and illustrations are beautiful, of course. TMBG is known for their cutting-edge taste in designers almost as much as for their music, and so the design and illustrations of the book are bound to catch a child's attention and hold it for a bit.<br />The text of the book, however, is just song lyrics, and I'm of the opinion that song lyrics generally don't make good reading -- without the music, at least half (if not more) of the experience is missing. And TMBG lyrics are so typically strange, you really do need the music to complete the context.<br />Of course, the book was meant to be read along with the enclosed four-song CD, and I do think the book is rather pointless without the CD. I take issue, however, with the recasting of the book's title song as a \\"lullaby.\\" This plodding, tuneless version of the song would put anybody to sleep, in the hope of getting away from Kimya Dawson's monotonous voice. They may have done better to kick off the book and CD with the march-like, sound-effects studded version of \\"Bed Bed Bed\\" as it's featured on the \\"No!\\" album, and saved the floating, lovely \\"Idlewild\\" for the closing lullaby.<br />Last week I attended one of TMBG's \\"family concerts,\\" and it was pretty clear that the \\"No!\\" album is building a very young sector in the TMBG listening audience. There's a lot to love about the \\"No!\\" disc, with its upbeat songs and fun animations. The \\"Bed Bed Bed\\" book and CD, while a beautiful package, is less accessible. I do hope the Johns will give children's publishing another shot!	2003-10-31

As someone who has studied Plath's life and work for a long time, I was intrigued by the notion of someone having taken on Plath, Hughes, and their friends and families as characters for a novel.<br />The chapters of &quot;Wintering&quot; are each titled after one of Plath's &quot;Ariel&quot; poems, in the original sequence Plath had planned for the book -- the manuscript was to begin with the word &quot;love&quot; and end with the word &quot;spring.&quot;  &quot;Wintering&quot; author Kate Moses has clearly done a lot of excellent research -- this is apparent even before you get to her notes at the back of the book.  Readers who are familiar with Plath's life and work  will find the characters' thoughts and the book's settings dressed with details from Plath's poems, journals, and letters -- the six jars of honey, the &quot;lurid skins&quot; of balloons that appear in an &quot;Ariel&quot; poem.<br />It is on this level that &quot;Wintering&quot; succeeds as &quot;A Novel of Sylvia Plath.&quot; Kate Moses has immersed herself in the wealth of material that's out there, by and about Plath, and has produced a crystalline snowglobe world out of what had been chunks and fragments.<br />It's also interesting that the novel appears not to take sides. Plath and Hughes are human, each with strengths and flaws. Even Dido Merwin and Assia Wevill are fleshed out, rather than left as flat villains of the piece.  <br />But herein lies what dissatisfied me about &quot;Wintering&quot; -- there doesn't seem to be any villain or, if a villain, per se, isn't necessary, there's no fire, no thrill, none of the crash and bang and intensity one gets from reading Plath's actual writing, whether it's her poems or journals. Apart from one scene in which a delirious Plath hears strange voices on the telephone and seems to see carrion birds in her house, there is no hint of her irrationality and demanding nature (aspects of her personality that have been under debate for decades, as to whether they really existed) or her intensity (which was an undeniable Plath trait).<br />Even though I was largely dissatisfied with the book (far too many of us Plath fans feel like we own her), there's no denying Kate Moses' achievement. Her creation is believable and incredibly detailed, especially the descriptions of life at Court Green (as idyllic and bucolic as I ever imagined it myself), the interactions of the Plath and Hughes characters (both as newlywed writers goading each other to produce, and as an estranged couple), and Plath's isolation during the winter in London, as she cares for her two young children.<br />I'm giving the book only three stars because, though I feel Plath fans will enjoy it, I can't imagine a casual reader picking it up and pushing all the way through to the end. As far as I'm concerned, a good biography of Plath is still much more interesting, especially with the mystery of &quot;What was going through her head that day?&quot; Though Moses has imagined that in a believable way, the mystery of not knowing is still more interesting.<br />The glory of &quot;Wintering&quot; is in the details -- details that have been picked up from primary source material: the poems, letters, and journals of Sylvia Plath.	2003-10-10

Which is rather high praise, all things considered. I expected the book to be downright ugly.<br />Instead, it's mostly harmless. The four \\"main characters,\\" the group of girlfriends known as \\"the English Roses,\\" are featureless and interchangeable. They have lots of fun dancing, talking about boys, and having sleepovers. <br />They are also united in their hatred of the prettiest girl in school (the drawings of this girl look suspiciously like Madonna), having drawn the conclusion that all pretty girls are stuck up.<br />Enter a fairy godmother who offers the Roses a chance to trade places with the pretty girl, to see what her life is really like. Once the Roses find out the truth about the pretty girl, they feel more kindly toward her, and invite her to be their friend.<br />The message -- don't judge people by their looks -- is heavy-handed. No, wait...it's HEAVY-HANDED.  I mean REALLY HEAVY.  And this is to blame for most of the book's badness.<br />If you are a nitpicky reader, like me, other things contribute to the badness, like the fact that there are no characters -- nobody has any distinct characteristics. There's also no real story; this could hardly even be called a fable. All of it is rote and not terribly deeply-felt.<br />It's also not a picture book. Even a \\"story\\" as trite as this one would have been better served in a middle-reader or chapter book format. No wonder the four Roses have no personalities -- there's hardly enough time to develop those personalities or the dynamic of the group in a mere 32 pages.<br />Given the age of the Roses, also -- I figure they must be preteens, since they talk about boys, yet they still have sleepovers -- this should have been a middle-reader. <br />I know it's Madonna, and people of all ages are going to buy the book for people of all ages. But droves of people would have bought it anyway if it was anillustrated chapter book. Chapter books, however, are not cute, and picture books are.<br />Speaking of cute, I loved the illustrations in this book. They're girly and sweet and cheeky all at once. The illustrator captured a unique spirit that belongs solely to the English Roses. If they have any personality at all, it's because of him.	2003-09-15
US	52433630	R3TR36DIEW9ZWX	0684853523	44310359	On Writing:  A Memoir of the Craft	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Great memoir, fair how-to	I'm a long-time King fan. Recently, I read his solid, somewhat literary collection of short stories, &quot;Everything's Eventual,&quot; and was blown away by his foreword to the book, in which he talks a lot about how he has tried to stretch the boundaries of the short story, the novel and the serial novel. <br />If that wasn't fascinating enough, he went on to talk about how he has also tried to experiment with the marketing of his work (he goes into detail about the unsuccessful Internet-only marketing of &quot;The Plant&quot;).  Imagine -- Stephen King, bestselling writer, talking turkey about marketing. Very interesting indeed!<br />I expected &quot;On Writing&quot; to include more of the same information about how King writes and how the books get sold. In &quot;On Writing,&quot; King certainly talks about his process, as well as some nuts-and-bolts aspects of writing, but the book is quite personal and never goes into the business aspects of writing and publishing. That's not the point of &quot;On Writing.&quot; <br />So what is the point? Well, look at the title. The book is primarily a memoir. The first section of the book is full of anecdotes from King's childhood -- the events that made him a writer. They're fun and not terribly profound, and he tells the readers to expect as much. <br />The  section of the book that's the how-to-write section is, I feel, full of things you can read in other books about writing. King is aware of this, and keeps it short and sweet.  My grammar is far from perfect, but I really could have done without the section about grammar. Does anybody read a Stephen King book for the grammar?<br />The value of the how-to-write section lies in the metaphors King constructs to illuminate for the reader why certain conventions of writing work the way they do; why they are important. These metaphors are down-to-earth and just might mean something to a new writer who's struggling with the basics.  <br />The last part of the book is a wrenching account of the accident that nearly killed King in 1999. This part of the book held my interest most completely, because it was the only part that didn't already seem familiar to me.  King long recovery included a writing crisis, which is why the story of the accident is included in &quot;On Writing.&quot;<br />In general, I think there are better books about writing/becoming a writer/living the writing life, but this book is certainly a must-read for any King fan. I particularly appreciated hearing how King's wife, Tabitha, has been so supportive over the years (without taking any B.S., either!), and the list of King's favorite books.	2003-09-11

I reread those first several chapters, going over them more slowly than I was able to in the bookstore, and laughing more loudly than I was able to in the bookstore. <br />The beginning is definitely the best part, when the protagonist is a sarcastic drunk. The scenes at the rehab clinic are especially wonderful, and are recognizable by anyone, even those of us who haven't been through these kinds of therapy. <br />The sarcasm effectively turns recovery cliches on their heads in the beginning part of the book, and then the protagonist begins to recover and get healthy, and that's when the book loses a lot of its bite and recovery cliches become recovery cliches. <br />Burroughs' writing is good enough to propel the reader to the end of the book -- as I said earlier, I finished the book in one sitting -- but recovery is recovery is recovery.	2003-09-11

This fairy-tale adventure about a mouse, a rat, a princess, and a servant girl is told in a measured, mannered voice that's a departure for DiCamillo's usual casual style. There are frequent appeals to the \\"dear reader,\\" which work for me as they do in so few other books.<br />Despereaux is the youngest mouse in his family. He is runty, with huge ears, and prefers reading books to eating them. We're given glimpses of his family -- his faithless father, his very proper sister, his loutish brother whose favorite word is \\"Cripes!,\\" and his French mother, whose English is slightly stiff and very amusing. Before long, Despereaux's non-mousely behavior gets him banished to the dungeon, where the castle rats will presumably eat him. <br />He escapes, of course, only to cross paths with a vengeful rat who has taken a slow-witted palace maid into service, to help him carry out his plan to punish Princess Pea, the object of his hatred and Despereaux's devotion.<br />Forgiveness, second chances, embracing the light, being who you are, the importance of stories, and the restorative properties of a hot bowl of soup all come into play to create a delicate, magical book that I suspect may have more longevity than the celebrated but ultimately somewhat ordinary Because of Winn-Dixie.	2003-09-08

The wicked, wicked ladies seem like they could be much more wicked, though I did enjoy the way they were introduced (via a series of portraits that hang in their ruined old house). I wish there had been other little gimmicks like that in the book, to make it stand out.<br />If you want a book about running around in an old house, I recommend Ellen Raskin's \\"The Westing Game\\" or \\"The House With a Clock in Its Walls\\" by John Bellairs. Those books will stay with you for a long time, and they warrant rereading. The wicked, wicked ladies simply don't have much to recommend them.	2003-08-25

He's a musical genius who masters every instrument he picks up, only to toss it away out of boredom soon after. By the end of this story, told in fun, lilting verse, Farkle has found a way to be involved in music; a way that also holds his interest.<br />John Lithgow's books are a cut above many other children's books written by celebrities. The rhymed verse that he uses to tell Farkle's story bounces and rambles along, and it's almost impossible not to hear Lithgow's voice in your head, \\"reading\\" the book to you.<br />The illustrations by C.F. Payne are at once sensitive and wonderfully silly; they're a perfect match for Lithgow's text. I have been known to bring this book out for friends and just open it to certain pages (such as the one showing Farkle with the cymbals) to exclaim, \\"Look at this painting! Look at the kid's face.

This simple little picture book contains so much warmth, it's a wonder you don't start to sweat a little when you pick it up. \\"Octopus Hug\\" is a charming look at the games a father plays with his children when he's left in charge for the evening. The games are wonderfully active -- and interactive. The dad gets down on the floor with Becky and Jesse (the children in the book are actually named after two of Laurence Pringle's own children), pretends to be different animals and objects, and encourages the children to join in. The fun is still going on when the mom returns home, so she gets to experience the games, too. <br />The illustrations by Kate Salley Palmer put this adorable story over the top. I especially like the way the father is portrayed; he reminds me of a stainless, free-of-murderous-impulses OJ Simpson. His love for his children and his excitement at being able to entertain them are written all over his face.<br />I've had the pleasure of meeting author Laurence Pringle a couple of times, and this book is a pretty good representation of the man himself; gentle and fun-loving, with a slightly kooky sense of humor. Word has it that a sequel, possibly titled \\"Bear Hug,\\" is in the works!	2003-08-24

Stories from Granny's girlhood in Italy help Rosie to see that jealousy is normal, and that the best friendships prevail no matter how angry friends get with each other from time to time.<br />The characters' voices are all wonderfully authentic. Granny Torrelli is Old-World Italian without being a stereotype. Rosie's pre-adolescent emotional ups and downs are recognizable and bittersweet to older readers; younger readers will see themselves in her as well.<br />The pronunciations of the Italian words are fun, and skillfully incorporated. I wish Sharon Creech had transliterated \\"chia chia chia\\" for the readers, though. It's not pronounced \\"CHEE-a,\\" but \\"keeAH\\" -- it's the sound a chatty person makes, with all their talking!<br />You don't have to be Italian to like this book.

Add to that, the fact that Jack Gantos is a plain-old wonderful writer, and you've got a winner.	2003-08-20

It didn't disappoint.  The sensitivity that peeks out from behind the whimsy in Henkes' picture books is given a chance to shine in Olive's Ocean.<br />Just before leaving on her family's annual summer trip to Cape Cod, 12-year-old Martha receives a strange gift -- a page from the journal of a dead classmate she hardly knew. Upon reading the dead girl's words, Martha becomes haunted by the knowledge that she and this girl were so much alike, they could have been friends. She's determined to do right by Olive, who was friendless in life, and she's determined to find herself in the process as well.<br />Martha achieves both goals, not without a few stumbles and setbacks along the way. Martha has a lot to think about -- boys, her aging grandmother, her father's obvious unhappiness with his chosen occupation (writing) and her excitement and uncertainty over her own chosen occupation (writing!).<br />There is a certain epiphany about three-quarters of the way through the book that I feel comes too fast and too easily, but it's forgiveable because the rest of the book rings so true.<br />This book reminded me of a sort of \\"beginner\\" version of one of my favorite books in the world -- \\"A Ring of Endless Light\\" by Madeleine L'Engel.  \\"Olive's Ocean\\" is great for 10-year-olds and maybe even some eight-year-olds, whereas I'd give \\"A Ring of Endless Light\\" to kids ages 12 and up, and maybe a few astute 10-year-olds. <br />It's wonderful to see another side of Kevin Henkes. There was already no doubt that he and his colorful books are here to stay, but this piece in a more muted palette is beautiful as well.	2003-08-18

It is an interesting book, but it's not for every child. <br />The story, like that of Coraline, seems warmed-over. A slight spin on tried-and-true conceits we've all seen before. I felt that it worked in Coraline. I don't feel it elevates to anything special here.<br />I also don't feel like this is a picture book; it may have worked better as a graphic-novel-style chapter book or middle reader. There's too much story here for a picture book (the pages with four sort of \\"panels\\" on them seem especially unreadable to me), but not quite enough story to make the book worthwhile. For example, I would have liked to have seen a lot more of what the family's life was like within the walls.<br />Gaiman fans will no doubt want this for their collection, but I'm not sure The Wolves in the Walls will convert many readers who are unfamiliar with his work. Coraline was a book that could achieve such a thing.<br />The standouts here, however, are Dave McKean's illustrations; a haunted, haunting mixture of flat shadows and sparkling lights, part illustration, part photography. I'd open the book again just to \\"read\\" the pictures.	2003-08-13

The language of this picture-book mystery was so engaging, I can still hear my mother reading it to me: &quot;My knees were apple butter. My heart skipped rope in my chest.&quot;<br />Two little girls are searching for the villain who has been going around town smashing jack-o-lanterns. The story is set in the past -- horses and buggies abound. One townsperson who owns a car is viewed as very strange indeed: &quot;Get a horse,&quot; he is told. <br />I had the pleasure of meeting author Judith St. George a couple of years ago; I was familiar with some of her other books, but I had no idea she'd written this one. Sadly, it's out of print, but scratch up a copy if you can. The humor is sweet and wry by turns, and the identity of the Halloween Pumpkin Smasher is a big surprise.	2003-07-24

Toddlers will love the bold-lined, simple drawings, and primary-graders will giggle in recognition at the sly, bribing, wheedling pigeon who  just wants what he wants, even though he knows he's not supposed to have it.<br />I laughed out loud many times, especially when the pigeon offered to give me five bucks.<br />The ending is cute and winky-wink too. Children and adults will recognize themselves in this stubborn yet fickle pigeon. A real charmer!	2003-07-23
US	52433630	R1LQAWVSM7VCDD	0670036129	987631718	The Queen's Progress	Books	5	3	4	N	N	A Regal Book	Celest Davidson Mannis and Bagram Ibatoulline combine the genres of alphabet books and historical picture books and take both to new heights.  <br />Each page presents a different letter, with the ornate, scrolly letter taking up most of the page. Clever quatrains about the featured letter are accompanied by a small chunk of text that further explains the significance of what's been described in the quatrain -- for example, X is for xanthus, and though the brief rhymed poem explains what a xanthus is, the prose at the bottom of the page offers historical information that justifies its inclusion in the book.<br />The illustrations are exquisite. I've been a fan of Ibatoulline's work for some time now, and the pictures in this book are period-perfect, with colors that bring to mind an illuminated manuscript.<br />It's also fun to go through each picture and try to find the page, the maid, and the dwarf who play important parts in the adventure story that is skillfully woven into the poems and prose. <br />This book works on so many different levels, older children and adults will find much to learn and enjoy here.	2003-07-23

I can't imagine any real people -- in any locale, during any time period -- actually speaking this way.<br />The characters are the strongest thing about the book. 12 -year-old Nissa is a believable preteen, full of strong feelings and  confusion about those feelings. Is she a child or a woman? Is she capable of making her own decisions? What will her decisions mean in the larger picture of her life? <br />Her father is also finely-drawn -- a strong, silent type who is driven, on several occasions, to betray that nature and give in to emotional outbursts. He is the most complex, least cliched character in the book, and the scene in which he does his best to explain menstruation to Nissa is quite touching.<br />Nearly everyone else -- from the snitty, small-minded townspeople, to Nissa's free-spirited mother -- can be found in any number of  other children's books. If you want to read really good writing about a strong-minded, free-spirited woman matching wits and wills with mean-spirited townspeople, check out Richard Peck's \\"A Long Way From Chicago,\\"  \\"A Year Down Yonder\\" and \\"Fair Weather\\" -- books which offer much the same feel as \\"Nissa's Place,\\" but with stronger plots and more of a point in general.	2003-07-14

When the cats' pampered way of life is threatened, Varjak ventures out into the big bad world to fetch help. Along the way he meets loyal friends, fearsome enemies, and learns a sort of martial art for cats that is not as stupid as I just made it sound. <br />This is one of the most well-constructed books I've read in a while. The writing is smooth and elegant, yet the adventure never lets up.  Adult and young-adult readers will find much to enjoy -- and learn from -- in this exciting and wise tale.	2003-06-19

Let's hope Jeanne DuPrau complies.	2003-06-19

It definitely warrants rereading.	2003-06-19

Diane Middlebrook has assembled a complete picture of Billy Tipton's world -- the music, the gender roles, his family -- that succeeds in holding a reader's interest despite the paucity of personal writings and memorabilia left behind by Tipton himself. <br />If you're looking for sex, you won't find much here. Billy Tipton had several \\"wives\\" (in quotation marks because he wasn't legally married to most -- if any -- of them) but managed to avoid sexual intercourse much of the time. The women he did have sex with swear they slept with a man, but if they revealed details to Middlebrook, they're not included in the book.<br />Tipton lived in an age where one's personal affairs were not the topic of casual conversation. Those who suspected or knew his secret kept quiet; many of the interview subjects throughout the book are heard to say, \\"You just didn't talk about those things. You didn't go prying into people's personal business.\\" The book's focus on gender roles -- especially within the context of the times and Billy's chosen profession -- is appropriate, engaging, and allows Billy Tipton to maintain the dignity he deserves.	2002-06-26
US	52433630	R2BGZUJCTWPAUO	068981514X	547790345	Dad, In Spirit	Books	2	2	4	N	N	Too self-conscious.	When I first began reading this book, I thought it was going to be yet another book about how the 'boring' kid in a 'stellar' family finds out what makes him special.  <br />This book is indeed that sort of book, but it throws the reader a few curves, the first one being that of Ebon's apparent \\"gift,\\" and another one being the fact that the rest of his family seems to have it too. Uh-oh -- suddenly the \\"special\\" kid is right back where he was: ordinary. <br />The stilted dialogue and \\"kid-like\\" diction don't help matters -- kids just don't talk the way the kids talk in this book. People don't talk the way people talk in this book. The family in the book uses their own slang terms and nicknames for parts of the house, family members, etc -- fine, many families too -- but none of it feels natural. <br />It has been said that a bad writer is conscious where she should be unconscious, and unconscious where she should be conscious. The writing in this book shows evidence of exactly these problems.<br />The story itself is quirky and fanciful. It tries hard to offer fun and entertainment, and, if you can get past the imprecise, overdone writing, it succeeds.	2002-05-23

I love the way the quick-thinking boy and girl fashion a collar and leash for the dog out of their own clothing, claiming him as their own before the nasty dogcatcher can nab him. My heart is doing happy little flips just thinking about it!	2002-02-04

Instead of gathering grains and seeds with the other mice, Frederick gathers colors, scents and other beautiful things that provide the mice with much sustenance during the cold, bleak winter. <br />This simple little book carries quite a big message about how important art and artists are.	2002-02-04

This book gives an intimate look at one of &quot;America's Castles&quot; from inside and out. The history of the building site is covered, as is the design and construction of the buildings. The life and times of W.R. Hearst and his friends and loved ones are presented in such a way as to flesh out the character of the house.<br />I just finished reading this book, and I'm tempted to pick it up and start all over again. This is one that I'll reread often.<br />The layout of the book is interesting and eye-catching, but the tints used on the pages sometimes make the text difficult to read. Make sure you sit down with this book in a very well-lit room -- not only will light make it that much easier to read, you'll be able to enjoy the wonderful pictures more easily.	2001-10-09

The story is played out with a few twists &amp; turns, but nothing too terribly original.<br />My biggest problem with the book was, the narrator has a deep dark secret that we don't find out about until well into the book. Likewise, her parents have a family secret that we don't find out until very late in the game. These secrets are sprung on us in an ineffective way; they should have been &quot;issues&quot; from page one of the book.	2001-10-02

I'm glad to say that Karen Hesse's WITNESS is an exception.<br />The voices are distinct and interesting -- I especially like those of Esther Hirsch and the Pettibones. The &quot;plot&quot; is compelling and not at all predictable. The photographs at the front are a nice touch -- they really create the community and flesh out the voices.	2001-08-23

I've read so many books about plucky misfit girls with weird names, it's practically a genre, and one that has been handled more adeptly elsewhere. <br />The book moves along quickly and simply, and is probably good for kids who might not normally read for pleasure. It's good for sharing with the whole family. But I don't think it's the richly-nuanced piece of literature that so many others seem to think it is.	2001-08-23

It wasn't long before I realized that the book had a lot of &quot;air&quot; in it -- the author kept saying the same thing over &amp; over, trying to create excitement, trying to stretch the manuscript. I became annoyed, but I finished the book because I wanted to know what they found in Beethoven's hair.  The results were mildly interesting, but certainly not worth hours of my time.  My boyfriend summed it up perfectly: &quot;It should have been a magazine article, not a book.&quot;	2001-01-08
