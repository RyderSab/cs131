US	33360060	R2NXLMMLDC4JKN	1552977692	898222827	Best Trees for Your Garden	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Very readable	The writer has extensive horticultural experience at prestigious institutions in England, Canada and the US. He brings this life experience and background to this book, and he is able to relate to gardeners in the climates and conditions of all three countries. Not only does he have a vast store of knowledge and practical experience on the topic, he presents it in a friendly and readable way.<br />This book is all about selecting the right tree for your garden. In his introduction the writer acknowledges the significance of selecting a tree that may outlive us. His first chapter, &quot;Understanding Trees&quot; is quite the best introduction to the topic I have ever encountered (and I've read a lot of tree books).<br />A later chapter, &quot;Trees and Man&quot;, while only touching a few highlights, gives a useful overview of the ways in which man has made use of trees through the ages. Rather more than half the book is devoted to directories of broad-leaved trees and conifers. These choices, while somewhat subjective, would make useful and attractive trees in the right garden environment.<br />The book is nicely illustrated with Steven Wooster's color photographs.	2004-06-26
US	33360060	R1WOY4POWHKXX1	0553803484	307659188	The Murder Stone	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Fast paced	This is a rattling good story, well told. The writer, departing from his previous Ian Rutledge series, this time explores the world of Francesca Hatton, a young heiress who finds her previously ordered world crashing down around her. She has to discover the truth about her grandfather - truth that seems both hidden and horrific.<br />Set in the time of World War 1, a period that resonates for the writer, the novel traces the maturing of Francesca in a world where her five male cousins and close childhood playmates have been killed in the war and where damaged men return from the battlefields struggling to pick up the pieces of their lives. The horror of the war and its carnage are never far away.<br />Plot and characters are all well developed and the pacing is good throughout. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. My only quibble would be that the male writer loses touch with Francesca towards the end, and doesn't fully  enter the emotional world of a young woman contemplating marriage.<br />Other than this, it is an exciting tale, told with wit and insight.	2004-06-19

It was frustrating - a few of the characters were well-drawn - Aunt Julia and her mother, for example - but most were so bland it was hard to remember who was who.<br />The setting, a hospital in Maine, was similarly frustrating. The hospital itself was well drawn. Maine could have been anywhere from Kansas to Utah if you threw in a coastline.<br />I can usually identify with a female protagonist, but not this one, she was bland and featureless, her husband even more so. The plot, well, the writer doesn't bother with actual plot twists, she just throws in a few wierd events that don't relate meaningfully to anything and has everybody driving off in all directions. Finally the motivation. The one I hate most - he/she did it because he/she was crazy.<br />Some humor or some attitude might have lifted this book out of the doldrums; it definitely isn't this writer's best work.	2004-06-16

A leading art critic has been murdered. Now I hesitate to read books about the art world because either the writer talks down to the reader, or a non-art historian hasn't a clue what it's all about. This writer manages to explain the art world quickly, simply and effectively. I understood and I didn't feel patronized.<br />This is a good story; it moves right along with plenty of action. The characters are so well drawn that you don't even notice the writer doing it. The background is authentic and the various motivations very true to the time, the setting and the plot. The dialogue was crisp and the transitions barely noticeable.<br />This is John Buchan meeting Anne Perry, with the addition of a sense of humor. I really enjoyed it.	2004-06-16

The writer shares a comprehensive understanding of the uneasy political and religious dynamics of the time, as well as life at court and the (very different) life in every-day Elizabethan England.<br />The plot is well designed and carried through and the characters are well-drawn and memorable. I enjoy the fact that the protagonist is a woman and the viewpoint is feminine rather than masculine. It's all too easy, when writing historical fiction, to gravitate to the masculine, with the hero mounting his steed and dashing off in all directions, with exciting chases and plenty of swashbuckling fights and battles. You'll find a little of that here, but mostly you'll find a woman just trying to do her best for her susceptible young relative and for her queen. It's just that she has an exciting time doing it.<br />Blending historical fact with dramatic and readable fiction is no easy task but the writer accomplishes it beautifully in this book. You feel the sad magnetism of Mary, Queen of Scots and the dedication and frustration of Sir Francis Knollys, her host and/or jailer.<br />I found this to be a really good read from a writer who really understands this period in history.	2004-06-11

I recommend it to any dog-lover. It is a literate, touching, funny book that rings true. The reader can enjoy it on many levels - it informs about dog (and people) behaviour, and if it taught me anything about dogs, it taught me more about myself.<br />This is a colleection of essays and stories by writers urban and rural, old and young, male and female. There's something for everyone who loves dogs (or a dog) and every reader will find his/her own treasures in it. I found that it was a book to savor slowly. I usually read a book every day or two - this one took me most of a week because it was not a book to be rushed.<br />I'm going to buy a copy of the magazine &quot;Bark&quot; to see if I like it as much as the book.	2004-06-09

Maybe the plot got a little confabulated at the end, but that's a minor point. This is a really good read for an animal lover. The writer has such warmth for her dogs, as well as for her human friends, that reading this is like basking in the warm sun. Even the villains were quite nice, you couldn't really hate and revile them.<br />The writer has assembled an interesting cast of characters who appear in this series, and she has the knack of getting her readers involved in their lives so that we really care about Rita's love-life and Althea's health as well as Holly and Steve and their dogs. For once I can actually remember who the characters are when I pick up the book again - I find them well drawn and very true to life. I enjoyed her digs at the intellectual elitism of the town, and her irreverent attitude to most things, including her own wedding. <br />This was a very pleasant, light read. The love of dogs shone through it and made me realize how much my own dog means to me.	2004-05-31

The story and its characters are set in the Regency world left behind by Jane. This is a refined, drawing room tale, with overtones of detection and Gothic mystery. <br />The writer has tried to write in the same vein as Jane Austen, but there are a few jarring lapses. It's hard to maintain the accuracy and tone when you're a couple of hundred years after and a couple of thousand miles away.<br />The writer manages to convey the social scene and offers acute observation of social interactions. Some of her characters are less than finely drawn, though, and this can be a distraction. But the plot holds up well and this makes an intriguing story, interestingly told.	2004-05-31

On the plus side you have Dorcas, the librarian, through whose eyes we are involved in the action. As viewpoint character she is easy to identify with, sympathetic and astute. But the other major characters, including her obese twin sister Abigail, are gross caricatures, overwritten puppets manipulated by the writer.<br />The somewhat bizarre plot works reasonably well, even though we know from the beginning who killed whom and why. However the combination of bizarre plot and bizarre overwritten characters would be outlandiish if it were not that writer has such an acute observation of the human condition and the complex deceptions we work on ourselves in order to protect ourselves from unpleasant truths. This is one sharp writer. And she is VERY funny too.<br />For the insights and humor alone this book is worth reading.	2004-05-24

In addition she tells a fast paced and complex tale, full of action and characters that ring true across eight hundred years. She hasn't been bogged down by the conventional wisdom about the time and its people (Richard - good, John - bad) instead we see them as the complex and often confounded people that they were. She shows us the struggle across the Welsh marches, the beauty of Wales and the strength of its people.<br />She has given us a protagonist with a wonderful mixture of strengths and failings. Justin de Quincey is maturing nicely in this series. I'm looking forward to reading more about his exploits.	2004-05-24

This is lucky because he frequently interrupts the action to take the reader on a tour of the kitchens or some other part of the naval architecture.<br />Otherwise I found this book boring. There's lots of action, mind you, and at stake is nothing less that the future of the western world prior to World War Two. There are characters from the highest ranks of Britain (the detective is a Lord) and Hollywood. There's lots of action, with a violent storm at sea (get the symbolism? huh?) and dead bodies all over.<br />I won't reveal the plot because I've forgotten it already, but as you may have guessed the western world was saved by the strength and sagacity of Milord. We are truly fortunate that the British aristocracy has produced so many fine detectives.	2004-05-24

The focus is on the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The protagonist, Scotland Yard Inspector Sam Blackstone, is led through the streets of the poorer area of London and becomes involved with the emigres and outcasts of Russian society who have formed their own community there.<br />This is well plotted, but the social history and the period are much like those of Anne Perry, and comparisons between the two writers are inevitable. Anne Perry has nothing to worry about - this is a poor imitation of her work. This is actually quite a good book but it falls a long way short of Anne Perry's prose. A completely different setting might have shown this writer to better advantage.<br />This shows the obligatory comparisons between the life of rich and poor in Victorian England; it has a sympathetic and well realized protagonist and even a beautiful Russian spy. It's a decent, workmanlike book - but it ain't Anne Perry.	2004-05-24

The information isn't just facts - feelings and emotions are represented too.<br />From the 10,000 year old tomb of a woman who was buried with her arm around her dog to the young people in the detention centre in California who train assistance dogs this bond between humans and dogs has held firm. The writer mentions some working dogs - sheep herders, sled dogs, guide dogs and drug sniffers but he makes it clear that most dogs are companion dogs who spend most of their time eating and sleeping.<br />The writer did a good job of exploring the bonding and the emotional contact between people and their dogs without too much mawkish sentiment. There was even a brief mention of the darker side of the relationship - older dogs who are abandoned by their humans.<br />But mostly this is a feel-good, happy book with wonderful photographs of people and their dogs.

It answers questions such as \\"Who first cultivated it in America?\\",  \\"How was it used?\\",  \\"Who propagated or sold it?\\" and \\"Why was it popular?\\".<br />The writer consulted over 300 seed and nursery catalogues from all over the US and ended up with a data base of over 25,000 different taxa. <br />The first chapter of the book looks at the historical detail of the garden landscape and it is illustrated with well-selected photographs, many taken from postcards. The second chapter links the gardens to the architectural styles from different time periods and the third chapter looks at the way garden styles evolved in different regions of the country.  The largest part of the book is a catalogue of over 1000 heirloom plants - trees, shrubs, vines, perennials and roses that were offered for sale between 1719 - 1939. For each plant there is given common names, family, date of introduction, earliest American citation, zones and description, taken from the garden writers of history.<br />This book presents a vast amount of material and it's a treasure trove for the garden historian. Even the most casual reader will enjoy the historical and botanical illustrations. It really is a treat to find such a well-organized work of scholarship that is so readable and attractively presented.	2004-04-15

Growing plants indoors is a much more limited topic and unfortunately this is a much more limited book. <br />The book starts with descriptions of some 20 easy-to-grow indoor plants such as dracaena and croton and some plants that are better avoided. It describes how to grow amaryllis, herbs and African violets, how to treat holiday plants and how to force bulbs. It goes on to discuss the importance of the correct level of light, tips for watering, growing plants from seed and dealing with plant pests and diseases. There is really nothing here that is new or original and there were many common plants - Boston fern and hoya come to mind - that barely rated a mention.<br />On the plus side, Sonia Day's writing is always fresh and light. It's a pleasure to read her prose even about the most mundane of topics. She is knowledgeable, not only growing plants successfully, but also about finding sources for research.<br />But there was so much lacking in this book - what about bromeliads, bonsai, cacti and succulents? What about using plants in specific rooms - the kitchen, dining room, bathroom? What about terrariums and mixed plantings? It was a disappointment to find such a limited and pedestrian approach from a respected and able writer.	2004-03-18

It's a coffee table book with a photo of a really hunky young man on the cover.<br />I enjoyed the writer's relaxed style, especially in his introduction - he sounds like a thoroughly likeable, decent bloke who has lucked into a really great gig. I enjoyed his assessment of many modernist garden designers. He writes, \\"...many designers have usurped the movement's title and poorly mimicked its smooth, sleek lines to produce gardens that are starkly architectural, ordered, precise, and to my mind soulless.\\" Amen to that. I also liked his obvious joy in gardening and his attempts, wherever possible, to save and protect as much as possible of existing gardens.<br />But I'll admit to being a philistine. I garden because I love the earth and growing plants. Sticking a bunch of architectural objects, bumps, lumps, spheres, eggs et al - all over a garden leaves me cold. For the rest of you, who appreciate the opportunity to look over the designers shoulder and watch him take an idea from imagination through inspiration through planning and detailing the final garden, this should be a treat.	2004-03-16

Unhappily, the book does not live up to the promise.<br />To be fair, not a great deal seems to be known about James Hutton and any writer would be stretched to develop a book-length manuscript with so little directly relevant material. This explains the tediously detailed tangents that the writer chooses to indulge in. They provide background and context but are pedestrian and uninspired.<br />The writer is introduced on the back cover as an editor \\"with a long career of publishing works of science\\". It seems that this is the first book he has written and one should therefore be tolerant. It doesn't explain why it is so poorly edited. The copy editing alone is abysmal - was there no-one to check typos and spellings? He over-uses the word \\"rigorous\\" which only goes to point out that his own work is less than rigorous. The book is noticeably US-centric and in parts the US-based vocabulary is both inappropriate and distracting. A greater sensitivity to words would have added a lot.<br />We have to be grateful to the writer for introducing this little-known scientist to a wider readership. However, he does not do his subject justice.	2004-03-15

So many garden writers seem to assume that their writers have a new garden that is like a blank sheet of paper - something you can plan for afresh, bringing in your own choice of new plants and starting from scratch. For many of us, this not the reality. We move into a house with an existing garden that may be anywhere on a spectrum from bland to a complete disaster.. This book is for us. It explains where (and when and how) to start, how to assess soil, existing plants and structure, it reminds the reader about possible local restrictions and guides our understanding of personal and gardening needs.<br />From there the writer takes the reader step-by-step through all the necessary tasks, from clearing away old hard landscaping to pruning trees, reviving lawns and replanting. It even offers suggestions to help limited finances be used in the most effective ways. There is an extensive directory of plants and resource lists for finding further information.<br />The writer, a professional gardener for 20 years, became National Gardens Manager for English Heritage.

The writers, one with a strong belief in the role of native plants in ecological restoration, the other a botanist who spent 12 years as Assistant Curator in the Herbarium at the University of Victoria, have together produced the most useful book about the topic.<br />Written with the gardener in mind (and a gardener who might not initially be knowledgeable about, or committed to, gardening with native plants) this book is both readable and packed with precisely focussed information.<br />The book is in three parts. The first part, \\"Working with Native Plants\\" covers topics such as designing the garden, what to do about lawns, propagation and gardening for wildlife. I particularly liked the ideas for hedges - eliminating rows of pyramidal cedars and planting native deciduous shrubs. Even, dare I say it, a hedgerow of mixed native shrubs, which would make a more useful wildlife corridor. <br />The second section, \\"Plants and their Habitats\\" picks up the theme of plant communities and their cultural requirements, describing in detail forest, shoreline, mountain habitats, etc., and native plants that would grow well there and be valuable to wildlife. The third section is a regional source guide, suggesting sources for plants, further information and education in both Canada and the US. Throughout the book each chapter has plants lists and a generous reading list.<br />The writers, while offering a vast amount of information, are aware that many gardeners will want to move towards this kind of gardening gradually, and the book is full of suggestions for doing this. There are so many reasons for using native plants - for starters they maintain and restore our heritage of local plants and help sustain wildlife. But for those who wish their gardens to be avant garde the writers point out that native plant gardening is the leading edge of gardening today and that the focus is moving away from colour (bright beds of annuals) and towards more emphasis on form and texture. This book will help all Pacific Northwest gardeners have more trouble-free, ecologically responsible and leading edge gardens.	2004-03-07

I've reviewed a lot of them and it takes a really good writer to make me care about the characters as people and to feel involved in their lives and their tribulations. Usually I read them in a detached way, assessing the characterization, setting, dialogue and so on. This story grabbed me from the beginning and I cared about Jack, Winnie, Fiona and the others and what happened to them. I found the setting completely engrossing - Glastonbury has depth and dimensions of history that the writer has portrayed accurately. This tale requires a great amount of suspension of disbelief, but it worked and worked well for me.<br />I am always impressed that an American woman can express English life, especially one eccentric corner of it, so precisely. It's not jut acute observation, it's an understanding of the feelings under the surface.<br />This is a really good English mystery novel, with an unexpected bonus of present evils woven into ancient wrongs. The writer's understanding of the thinness of the veil between the Old religion and the New, as well as the possibility, in certain circumstances, of the collapsing of time to reach others across the centuries is well balanced. This could have been mawkish and New Age precious but it isn't. The writer nails perfectly these spiritual and temporal ambiguities.<br />This is a fine book in a good series.	2004-02-17

In just a couple of pages the writer addresses them briefly but vividly, then goes on to suggest how you might start your garden planning from an assessment of your garden's assets and liabilities.<br />One of Ann Lovejoy's strengths is her knowledge of and commitment to all aspects of sustainable natural gardening. She presents this thoroughly without being wordy (quite a trick in itself) and points out that natural gardening - working with nature - is far easier and more satisfying than trying to control nature.<br />In the chapters on plant selection the reader is guided in the choice of trees, shrubs, perennials etc that are not just pretty, or fashionable this year, but that will really work well in a specific place in your garden. Careful plant choices mean a minimum of stress for the plant and a minimum of effort for the gardener.<br />This writer's particular talent is her ability to combine practicality with vision. Her books, while primarily written for the gardener in the Pacific Northwest, contain much that is of value to gardeners elsewhere.	2004-02-06

One of its strengths is that the writers understand, through experience, the differences in soil and climate that influence rock gardening in different parts of the continent. Because of this personal experience the dissimilarities are addressed fully and not just mentioned briefly.<br />With contributions from over 40 leading rock gardeners from all parts of North America this is a truly comprehensive book. The section I found most interesting and relevant was the generous chapter on \\"Soils\\" by Louise Parsons. A geologist and rock gardener, she looks at all types of soils, soil components and she offers guidelines for handling soils.<br />The four sections of the book deal with design principles and materials, types of rock gardens, structures and containers, and regional styles and techniques. The book concludes with an overview of ten public rock gardens, from Alaska to Kansas City, where you'll find fine examples of rock gardening. There is an appendix describing ingredients for rock garden soils and an excellent annotated bibliography. <br />I learned a great deal from this book - for one thing I had no idea there were so many types of rock gardens (who knew you could make a rock garden on a downtown balcony?). The writing is of uniformly high quality and each of the writers shares with the reader not just knowledge and experience but their passion for rock gardening.	2004-02-05

The writer has focussed on the people who influenced garden design in the twentieth century, from Gertrude Jekyll and Vita Sackville-West to designers who are only now hitting their stride. He concentrates on designers from Western Europe and North America and he has grouped the 56 designers by different aspects of garden design - for example, planting, form and texture.<br />I have to admit I'm not a fan of the self-consciously self-important school of garden design. Of course a beautiful garden requires careful planning, but if the finished result smacks you in the face with geometric shapes and larger-than-life hard structures then I might call it a piece of art, but I wouldn't call it a garden. O.K, I'm prejudiced, but I'd run screaming from some of the gardens in illustrated in this book.<br />That said, the writer is knowledgeable; he has selected his subjects carefully and arranged them in logical sequence.

The writer, a biologist at the University of Illinois has done a masterful job of explaining just what the earth beneath our feet contains. This book is a close look at what soil is, how it evolved, how it supports life and why it wears out. It also looks at the plants and animals that form the ecosystem of healthy soil and how we can help nurture them.<br />The first part of the book, \\"Working Partnerships\\", explains that soil consists of minerals broken down from rocks, together with plants and their bacterial, fungal and animal partners. It also explains how soil gets its fertility. This may sound like dull stuff, but the way this writer presents it, it's as fascinating as the unravelling of a mystery.<br />Part Tow presents members of the soil community - microbes, invertebrates and vertebrates. You'll meet some of the most extraordinary creatures here - mother centipedes guarding and licking their eggs, termites sabotaging tropical agriculture and beetles, lots of beetles. More species of beetle inhabit the earth than any other order of animals.<br />The final section is titles \\"The gift of Good Earth\\" and the writer very briefly presents the concept of erosion and how humans have contributed to the degradation of the soil. Finally he offers the idea that composting is the act of creating a wildlife refuge for many of the creatures living in the soil in our won backyard. I'd never thought of it in those terms before. The book ends with a decent reading list and list of web sites.<br />This is a readable and intriguing resource book for the library of any gardener or naturalist.	2004-02-01

The writer, a Master Gardener based in Seattle, sets out to help her readers to \\"find space where you think there is none and help you decide what to do with it\\".<br />The book has seven chapters. The first is a general introduction to the topic, looking at issues such as soil, watering, air quality and gardening on a slope (this was really useful for me). The other six each look at one area of the garden, such as the side garden, the front garden, and balconies. At the back of the book there are lists of trees, shrubs, perennials etc that should do well in most small Northwest gardens. The book is nicely illustrated with photographs by Jacqueline Koch.<br />I had the feeling that the writer has truly experienced the pleasures and problems of a small garden in the Pacific Northwest. She is knowledgeable, articulate and enthusiastic about the topic, giving fairly comprehensive information in a limited space. She doesn't shy away from awkward topics such as what to do about gaps in hedges.<br />This is a good, honest, value-for-money book for the Northwest gardener.	2004-01-25

Yes, we do have frost here, but it isn't the problem here that it is in northern New York State where Philip Harnden lives.<br />So, for all the gardeners in the colder regions of the US and Canada, here is a really useful book that explains how to outwit the weather and extend the spring and fall seasons. The writer is concerned primarily with the kitchen garden, mostly vegetables. You won't find much about flowers in here, although much of the advice would apply to most plants. What you WILL find is ways that determined gardeners even in New Hampshire manage to harvest at least a few vegetables all winter long. Even in Maine one couple enjoys a \\"four season harvest\\". An added pleasure in this book is the well-selected photography of plants and gardens in frosty weather.<br />If frost is a problem in your garden you'll enjoy reading this practical and down-to-earth book. This writer has been there, done that when it comes to cold climate gardening. The book is well-researched, well-written and contains a goodly number of resources for further exploration.	2004-01-23

This is a moving story, superbly researched and deftly told.\\"<br />In the small town of Nome, in the furthest northwest corner of the coast of Alaska, a diptheria epidemic occurs in the winter of 1925. The town doctor knows he needs serum to save lives but he has only a very small supply. There are no roads or railways to Nome. The port is unreachable because of ice and the airplanes of the time could not take off because of the extreme cold. The only solution is to run the serum in by dogsled, across Alaska in temperatures of around minus 60 degrees. <br />This is a saga of the heroism of both men and dogs. Some of the dogs died as a result of giving more than they had to the race across the ice. Men had their hands frozen to the sled. But they made it and saved many lives. Both men and dogs displayed valour and tenacity in conditions beyond anything we can imagine.<br />In telling this deeply moving story the writers take the opportunity to show us the basic elements of life in the outposts of Alaska - the effects of the cold, the wind, the winter darkness, the isolation. The readers don't learn this, they FEEL it. The pace of the story builds from the discovery of gold at Nome in 1898 to the dramatic, heroic dash with the serum in 1925.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes reading about the outdoors and the courage of men and dogs in overcoming impossible odds.	2004-01-21

The writer starts with the present time, providing a grounding and frame of reference by describing her own experiences while visiting the Klondike. She also concludes the book in the present wrapping the book up neatly with a chapter about a few of the well-known women living in the Klondike today. She takes care to include First Nations women throughout.<br />But the min body of the book deals with eight of the best known female characters of the Klondike gold rush, the role each of them played and the hardships they endured.  It makes compelling reading; the writer has an eye for detail and she has given a voice to these and to all the other women who faced the hardships of the north with as much strength and courage as the men.<br />As long as she is dealing with fact, the writer presents her material clearly and vividly. The problems arise when she drifts off into some fictional world that borders occasionally on the poetic and is inappropriate in this context. Another distraction for the reader is her 21st century interpretations of mostly 19th century theme. The worst distraction is that she seems to have been seduced into copying the flowery Victorian style of writing she encountered in her research. Why else would she write of a couple sharing \\"frolicksome laughter\\"? This reader practically gagged on that one.<br />But if you skip the overwrought fiction this is a well researched and very interesting read. Many of us are inspired by reading the lives of strong women and this is an important contribution to that literature.	2004-01-03

She takes care to include First Nations women throughout.<br />But the min body of the book deals with eight of the best known female characters of the Klondike gold rush, the role each of them played and the hardships they endured.  It makes compelling reading; the writer has an eye for detail and she has given a voice to these and to all the other women who faced the hardships of the north with as much strength and courage as the men.<br />As long as she is dealing with fact, the writer presents her material clearly and vividly. The problems arise when she drifts off into some fictional world that borders occasionally on the poetic and is inappropriate in this context. Another distraction for the reader is her 21st century interpretations of mostly 19th century theme. The worst distraction is that she seems to have been seduced into copying the flowery Victorian style of writing she encountered in her research. Why else would she write of a couple sharing \\"frolicksome laughter\\"? This reader practically gagged on that one.<br />But if you skip the overwrought fiction this is a well researched and very interesting read. Many of us are inspired by reading the lives of strong women and this is an important contribution to that literature.	2004-01-03

The writer starts by briefly reviewing the history of our love/hate affair with the front lawn and pointing out how costly they are in labour, water and poisonous chemicals.<br />The writer then explains how she changed her ordinary, lawn-filled front yard into a garden, working around the objections of her husband. From there she explains the groundwork that must be undertaken when a plain front yard is changed into a garden.

The final chapter \\"Overcoming Obstacles\\" shows how gardeners have coped with dry soil, steep gardens, a garden that must incorporate a fire hydrant or a power pole and so on.

The garden is the Milner Garden and Woodland, near Qualicum Beach on Vancouver Island off Canada's south west coast. It has an international reputation as a beautiful \\"natural\\" woodland garden. Sadly, the book does not do the garden justice.<br />The Veronica of the title is Veronica Milner, born to an aristocratic English family and related to both Winston Churchill and Princess Diana. She first married Desmond FitzGerald, Knight of Glin and lived a life of privilege in an Irish castle. Her second husband, Ray Milner, was a prominent and wealthy Canadian businessman who seems to have been an exceptionally nice man. Ray had previously been married to Catherine and the two of them had bought the land and developed what became the Milner Garden. Both loved the garden and the trees that gave it its lovely natural setting beside the ocean. After Catherine's death Ray met and married Veronica and somehow managed to live amicably with this selfish, snobbish, difficult woman and to finance her extravagances, which included improvements to the garden.<br />The writer seems to be fascinated with Veronica's wealthy and titled background, and with visits from the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Princess Diana to the garden. The reader has to struggle through page after page of name dropping. I had been hoping for a book about the garden, not \\"Lives of the Rich and Famous\\". There is very little information about the design of the garden, and how it evolved, and it seems that Veronica took much of the credit due to Ray and Catherine Milner. The illustrations are adequate (except for the maps, which are quite crude) but not professional quality and don't really reflect the beauty of the garden.<br />This is a regional book with little to recommend it to readers outside British Columbia. Actually, there's not much to recommend it to local readers either.	2003-12-23

The writer takes Aunt Vespasia, one the favourite characters from her Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series, and tells the story of one Christmas in her younger days. It isn't exactly a mystery story - a young woman commits suicide and her reasons for doing that seem obvious. But Anne Perry is master of digging beneath the obvious to find the truth beneath the truth.<br />The result is a tale that flows from an elegant house party in a country mansion north to the frozen snowy wastes of Scotland (and Anne Perry lives in northern Scotland so we can assume she knows whereof she speaks). It's a pilgrimage of sorts, with Vespasia and her friend Isobel toiling through storms and snowdrifts to find the mother of the dead woman and, incidentally the truth behind the suicide.<br />The only thing spoiling this good story is the overly moralistic tone that Anne Perry is increasingly becoming bogged down in. Of course you want characters with deep motivation - some pure, some mistaken, some evil - and the battle between good and evil always makes for good plot structure. But Anne Perry does tend to overdo it, leaving the reader wondering if she can stand being swamped beneath so many layers of virtue and morality.	2003-12-13

In essence it is the biography of Nicholaus Steno, a 17th century Danish scientist, later a bishop, who is considered by many to be the father of geology.<br />Steno observed that in the rock high on many mountains in Europe fossilized seashells could be found. Others had seen them before, but Steno was the man who came up with the correct hypothesis about how they got there. It seems simple enough now. The sea creatures lived in ancient oceans, died and were embedded in the sediment which later, over millions of years, was shoved up to create mountain ranges.<br />Steno was, in fact, a doctor whose anatomical discoveries made him famous initially He had such a delicate touch with the scalpel that he discovered glands never before known about and it was said that he could count the bones of a flea, if fleas had bones. His anatomical discoveries alone were enough to keep his name alive. <br />But he felt the need to try to advance the evolving philosophy of science. Science was still fighting the beliefs of the church, beliefs in the supernatural and early stabs at science that had often been very wide of the mark. Perhaps the seashells were carried up the mountains during Noah's flood. Steno was one of the first to believe that fact had to be distinguished from speculation and blind belief. One might advance a hypothesis but the scientist had to observe and test before announcing it as fact. Rene Descartes had proposed something similar, but was able ignore the principle when it became inconvenient.<br />Not everyone is interested in how the \\"new-fangled\\" scientists struggled to come up with ideas while fighting off the might of the church, pleasing their royal patrons and battling each other for supremacy. If you enjoy reading about the history of how we came to understand our world you'll love this book. The writer has done a vast amount of research and presented it in very readable form.	2003-12-09

Treat yourself, or a friend, to a copy and curl up beside a winter fire, or under the shade of a tree in summer to relax, learn and enjoy.	2003-12-04

The writer, a Master Gardener and well-known Canadian garden writer, takes a very practical and down-to-earth (sorry about the pun) approach to the topic.<br />This is a book written for the gardener who has to tote all her growing mix up either stairs or an elevator. The writer assumes that the reader might not know very much about gardening or might not know the best ways to adapt large-garden gardening to a very tiny and possibly wind-swept area. She does not waste words on anything that doesn't have practical application to growing plants on a balcony, rooftop or deck. There are lots of \\"do's and don'ts\\" lists that pack a lot of useful information into a very small space. This includes do's and don'ts for watering balcony plants and this is followed by ideas for ways to cut down on watering. If you've ever had to tote pails of water from the kitchen, through the dining room and living room to get to the balcony you'll appreciate these.<br />The strength of this book is that it addresses just about every question that a balcony gardener might think to ask; it is truly comprehensive in its approach. The writing is clear and concise and there are lots of little \\"hot tip\\" side bars contributed by experienced balcony gardeners. It even has suggestions for challenges such as damp courtyards, rooftops exposed to sun and wind and balconies so truly tiny that they look like concrete bunkers. Gardeners with these problems need flowers and foliage more than anyone, and this is one of very few books to offer useful suggestions for them.	2003-11-27

Forget the Pitts and Monk, Anne Perry has moved on in time to the start of the First World War and her main characters are brothers Joseph and Matthew Reavley. Joseph is a professor of biblical languages at Cambridge University and Matthew works for the British Intelligence. When their parents are killed in a car crash and Joseph's star student is shot the brothers find themselves having to begin unravelling a complex web of international intrigue.<br />An obscure Archduke is shot in Serbia. What could that possibly have to do with the death of the Reavleys and Joseph's cloistered world at Cambridge? Everything, it turns out, as international forces trying to prevent war vie against those riding heedlessly ahead. War is unthinkable, and yet it seems that there is something worse.<br />One of Anne Perry's strengths as a  writer is her understanding of the nuances in the relationships between  people and this is shown to advantage in this book. On the other hand, the pace is often slowed by moral discourses and discussions of right and wrong and greater rights versus greater wrongs. In addition to these endless moral dilemmas I didn't feel that the writer is at her best using male viewpoint characters. In her earlier books I loved the sheer fun of Charlotte Pitt and the social whirl and delicious ball gowns, as well as the juxtaposition of rich and poor in Victorian life. I felt for the anger and fire of Hester Latterly as she fought the Victorian medical establishment. I didn't feel for the Reavleys.<br />So this was not one of Anne Perry's more memorable books. I hope there will be more action and more three dimensional characters in the remaining books of the series.	2003-11-26

The book is divided into three parts - Traditional Gardens, Naturalistic Gardens and Specialty gardens.  Each part is composed of short, beautifully-illustrated articles written in a very personal style by a gardener, landscape designer or horticulturist. <br />It is the personal nature of each article that contributes most to the appeal of this book. Take the opening of Nani Waddoups article titled &quot;Tropical Garden, Temperate Zone&quot;. She writes \\"The newer parts of our garden look a little out of place...\\" How can you resist an opening like that? Her article describing her garden - listed in the Smithsonian Registry of Gardens - shows how her Hawaiian background prompted her and helped her to develop a lush pseudo-tropical garden in the Pacific Northwest. <br />My favourite section is that on Naturalistic Gardens. Five writers form points as far apart as Connecticut and Texas share with the reader ways in which they used the local climate, geology, soil and plants to create a garden that has given each of them great pleasure and satisfaction.<br />Top marks to the Taunton Press for introducing these garden writers first to Fine Gardening magazine and now in book form for those of us who like to sit down and read the whole collection. The editors have put together a book that offers gardeners a diversity of fresh ideas in a most attractive format.	2003-11-25

This is a detailed book about growing herbs and vegetables in containers - there is a chapter each on fruits and edible flowers too. Both writers are experienced growers and standard growing information is not only tailored to container growing, but is supplemented by the experience of two down to earth women who have been there and done that.<br />Sensibly organized, the book starts with planning a container garden and moves on to basic information such as the tools you'll need and the pros and cons of different types of containers. But most of the book tells you how to get the best crop from a great long list of vegetables and herbs There are chapters on growing fruit and edible flowers in containers and a decent list of mail order sources for seeds and plants.<br />I liked the direct, no-nonsense approach of the two writers. They have produced a thorough and thoughtful book, sensibly organized and both readable and knowledgeable.	2003-11-21

The plotting and characters were well done and the story moved along quickly and evenly. The plot opens with a totally submissive mother and young daughter, one or both of whom appear to have murdered the domineering husband/father. They don't ask for Dorothy Martin's help but they get it anyway. She and her ex-Chief Constable husband work on the case, tracking it through a self-righteous religious sect and almost to the British parliament.<br />The writer does two tricky things well. She manages to write reasonably accurately about life in an small English cathedral town from the point of view of an American, and she has two people working as a detective team without turning one of them into a buffoon (as in the Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot novels). She has also presented a fairly long series without becoming formulaic.<br />If you enjoy this genre, you'll probably like this book, so curl up beside the fire and enjoy, and share it with a friend.	2003-11-20

Jack Nisbet has the intuitive ability to cut to the heart of the subject, not just how this area was discovered but how the discovery influenced the native people and the natural history of the area. His own brief but discerning anecdotes about his interactions with the land and its people provide counterpoint and context for the main narrative.<br />The writer follows the life of David Thompson from his birth in London in 1770 and his education at a charity school to his apprenticeship with the Hudson's Bay Company and arrival in northern Canada. His major life work was to explore and map what became known as the interior of British Columbia, eastern Washington, western Montana and northern Oregon, focussed on the Columbia River and its tributaries. He crossed and re-crossed the Rocky Mountains through passes known only to native people and he established trading posts and trading relations with native people so he could supply the Hudson's Bay Company, and later the Northwest Company, with the furs they sought. Later in life he \\"retired\\" to montreal and later to Ontario where he became astronomer for the International Boundary Commission, guiding the U.S.-Canadian survey of the 49th parallel from Quebec, via the Great Lakes to Manitoba.<br />This is a story well told. It doesn't bog down in tedious detail yet still manages to convey the day- to-day routines as well as the excitement of discovery and the hardships faced by explorers in harsh terrain in an often bitter climate. The book has an immediacy and depth that are seldom realized together in an historical narrative.	2003-11-19

The writer runs the Aspen Valley Wildlife Sanctuary in Ontario, Canada. It's a sanctuary that accepts all kinds of wildlife and nurses and nurtures them until most of them can be released back into the wild. But the writer has a special affinity for beavers and in addition to the regular work of nursing and nurturing she and individual beavers do a whole lot of education, especially in schools.<br />The writer is both literate and passionate about her subject. For many years she has been called upon to deal with the aftermath of human interaction with beavers. Farmers dynamite dams and she gets a phone call from a concerned observer \\"All the beavers seem to be dead except this one kit who is hurt/burned/starving. Can you help?\\"  And so arrives Quibble, or Casey or Cassidy. One beaver at a time to be healed physically and emotionally as best a human can.<br />Transposed upon this \\"one at a time\\" are the facts and statistics: Canada was explored and developed in order to obtain beaver pelts. The beaver appears on the Canadian nickel not because it embodies the virtue of hard work but because it was once the back bone of the Canadian economy. And the writer points out that even now trappers in Canada \\"harvest\\" between 150,000 and 184,000 beaver pelts every year. (I'm Canadian, by the way, but it isn't just Canada that traps animals.) And these numbers don't count the number of beaver dams dynamited because they are inconvenient for farmers, home-owners and city planners.<br />The strength of this book lies in the juxtaposition of the mindless dreadful cruelty of mankind and the quiet humanity of rescuers and nurturers like the writer. (How can you fathom the mind of a reporter who turns up to do a story at the Wildlife Sanctuary wearing a beaver coat?) I loved this book. I laughed, I cried and I ended up angry and sleepless.

The writer doesn't spend a lot of time on technical stuff although he briefly outlines equipment needed ,lenses, camera formats, types of film and accessories. Then he moves quickly to the real meat of the topic - flowers, close-ups, gardens, trees, large vistas, indoor photography etc.<br />He is the ideal person to write a book on flower and garden photography as his work has appeared in some of the finest magazines, in calendars, greeting cards and art posters. He has lectured at some of the most prestigious art museums in the U.S. He has over 150,000 stock images, but best of all the man can write. He understands what a newcomer to the hobby might want to know and he lays it all out for the reader logically, readably and illustrated with his own superb photographs. There's plenty of sound advice along with the tips of the trade for getting more interesting and higher quality shots.<br />For photographers wanting to sell their garden photographs the writer explains what editors are looking for and how to present and market your photographs. He even gives you sample model releases and authorization for publication.<br />I can highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to improve their garden and flower photography.	2003-11-13

The writer, in twelve gentle essays, explores aspects of the natural and human history of the region. Combining the vast sweep of time with the wide range of ecology of such a large region is a huge undertaking. I'm in awe of a mind that can conceptualize such a topic, never mind bring it to fruition in book form. Of course 248 pages can't do the topic justice, but ten times or one hundred times the number of pages wouldn't do it justice either. The writer can only choose minute representative aspects of the whole and offer more information and a fresh lens through which to view it.<br />To take the dimension of history first. The writer starts out with a personal tale of hunting for trilobites in a creek swollen with snow melt. Trilobites are the tiny fossilized creatures whose massed bodies helped to create the land in this western corner of the U.S. But this is not a Geology 101 text. It places the 250 million year old fossil in the human scale of things - part of human history, part of the writer's experience. And that is the magic of this book - it takes a vast store of history, geology, nature and human nature and blends it into an understanding of how the Columbia River country used to be and how it came to be the way it is now.<br />The writer presents the natural history also. He shares with us the \\"water dog\\" (actually a salamander), the sheep moth and buzzards. We see muskrats through the eyes of native hunters and we discover Indian tobacco. We watch as the river changes with the coming of fur traders, dam builders and the presence of nuclear material.<br />The writer uses a rather circuitous approach to present a wide view of individual species and actions that are representative of eras and world views. This is a book rich with ideas, embracing a gentle all encompassing philosophy. I enjoyed this book because of the writer's understanding and appreciation of the land. On the practical side, however, the presentation of the book left something to be desired. For the reader trying to follow along, the map was inadequate. I would have appreciated a more detailed map showing historical names and places. More illustrations would have enriched the book, too.	2003-11-13
US	33360060	R1UZ8WYKBXWUQ8	1883403650	29198772	Flower & Garden Photography	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Useful and practical	This a very valuable introduction to the topic. The writer doesn't spend a lot of time on technical stuff  although he briefly outlines equipment needed ,lenses, camera formats, types of film and accessories. Then he moves quickly to the real meat of the topic, such as photographing flowers, trees, wide landscapes, close-ups, indoor plants etc.<br />He is the ideal person to write a book on flower and garden photography as his work has appeared in some of our finest magazines, in calendars, greeting cards and art posters. He has lectured at some of our most prestigious art museums. He has over 150,000 stock images, but best of all the man can write. He understands what a newcomer to the hobby might want to know and he lays it all out for the reader logically, readably and illustrated with his own superb photographs. There's plenty of sound advice along with the tips of the trade for getting more interesting and higher quality shots.<br />For photographers wanting to sell their garden photographs the writer explains what editors are looking for and how to present and market your photographs. He even gives you sample model releases and authorization for publication.<br />I can highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to improve their garden and flower photography.	2003-11-13

The writer, in twelve gentle essays, explores aspects of the natural and human history of the region. Combining the vast sweep of time with the wide range of ecology of such a large region is a huge undertaking. I'm in awe of a mind that can conceptualize such a topic, never mind bring it to fruition in book form. Of course 248 pages can't do the topic justice, but ten times or one hundred times the number of pages wouldn't do it justice either. The writer can only choose minute representative aspects of the whole and offer more information and a fresh lens through which to view it.<br />To take the dimension of history first. The writer starts out with a personal tale of hunting for trilobites in a creek swollen with snow melt. Trilobites are the tiny fossilized creatures whose massed bodies helped to create the land in this western corner of the U.S. But this is not a Geology 101 text.

This has to be done during the monsoon, when rain and sleet makes streams impassable and mist shrouds the mountains because that's the only time the flowers bloom. And what flowers they are. Their adaptation to the rocky cold world is often quite amazing. I expected to find pictures of primulas, rhododendrons, meconopsis - and these are all here. The cover shows a meconopsis that just about knocked my socks off. But there are other flowers too, some of which create a nice warm tent to encourage pollinators to visit. These and other adaptations are part of the fascination of this book.<br />You'll find in the book 108 beautiful flower photographs, often taken while lying on the wet stony ground after a wait of hours or days for the rains to let up and the sun to shine. Each picture is accompanied by brief field notes about the plant and they are arranged in taxonomic order. Why are there 108 photographs? Because that is the number of beads on a Tibetan rosary. The photographers sense of this being a spiritual quest as well as a scientific quest is demonstrated in the precision and beauty of the photographs.<br />Some of the flowers are familiar to us. There's a bergenia and a geranium not unlike those in my garden. But then there's a relative of the rhubarb that looks like a stack of cream puffs and can grow up to six feet tall. Inside the cream puffs the temperature is five degrees warmer than the inside - certainly attractive to pollinators in the Himalayan cold.<br />Toshio Yoshida has given us a rare treat in this book, giving readers vivid images of plants we may never see against a backdrop of the glaciers and peaks of the Himalayan mountains. His deep understanding of the place and the environment and his synthesis of the complexities of spiritual, artisticand scientific approaches has resulted in a book that can be appreciated on many levels.	2003-11-09

I read this book not because I was interested in orchids but because I'm fascinated by the lore and legends of plants. It was so beautifully written and so informative that I became interested in orchids.<br />I had always felt that orchids were somehow a bit \\"over the top\\". I had no idea just how \\"over the top\\" they were. By the tie I read the chapter on myths and legends I was hooked, and when I finished \\"Patrons and Hunters\\" I couldn't put the book down. Just as well because I would have missed the story about vanilla being part of the Aztecs chocolate drink, and, of course, thought to be an aphrodisiac. Montezuma was said to drink it fifty times a day, especially before visiting one of his many wives.<br />The book also covers the literature and art of the orchid and the magic, medicine and religion related to it. There are also chapters on the plant, the genera and on growing orchids and a list of information and illustration sources. There are some colour photographs and, throughout the text, delicate engravings from a wide range of historical sources.<br />This is a very literate book. Not a long book - the writer does not belabour any of his points, but an interesting and thought-provoking read. If you are interested in orchids or fascinated by the history and legends of plants, this is a must read.	2003-11-08

These are not your gentle Sunday afternoon antique shop browsers but sharks in Lamborghinis, some motivated by financial greed, others by the need to possess the finest Etruscan artifacts.

In this book he shares with the reader the essential role that architecture plays in organizing the garden landscape. With carefully chosen examples he shows how man-made features of the garden - paths, walls, gates etc. - create the framework for a garden that is both beautiful and easy to live with.<br />This book is readable and anecdotal in style, yet it covers the fundamental principles of design and shows how they can be put into practice to enhance many different types of garden. It is extensively illustrated, mostly with the author's own photographs, and these support the text in clearly delineating the applications of design principles to town gardens, seaside gardens, country gardens and so on.<br />Despite the author's relaxed approach this is a very thorough book and it will be invaluable to anyone planning a garden. My only quibble is that many of the gardens might be called estates, measured in acres, and to some extent this limits the book's practical value to the gardener with a standard city lot, or less.<br />But good &quot;bone structure&quot; is important in all gardens and this book will help any gardener pull together the significant man-made pieces of the garden into a graceful and beautiful whole.	2003-11-01

The dialogue is sharp, the insights make you identify with Juliet, and the latent wit is always ready to surprise you.<br />Juliet is a writer of Regency romances and her difficulties with her current novel are overcome only when her own love-life sparks up. This love life is nicely handled with much left to the imagination and (Praise be!) the careful avoidance of a happy ending. How refreshing to not be landed with an existing amore in the next novel where the reader is stuck watching the relationship toil its way to the next level or, perhaps, fizzle out.<br />The writer really worked with this novel - she finds parallels to her plot in both the real Regency period and the imaginary Regency world of her novel. It's clever, but it's just a bit contrived. She divides her story between two contemporary settings - the semi-sophisticated of New York City and the truly unsophisticated of a tiny village in upstate New York. If I lived in upstate New York I'd be feeling a bit patronized.<br />But it's a good story, with the advent of the bright and beautifully-flawed Ada making mincemeat of the New Yorkers careful lives. As long as the writer maintains her sharp prose and dialogue, keeps the characters clearly focussed and doesn't try to get too clever with her Muses this will be a series worth reading.	2003-10-28

This time it is a woman and the setting is New York of a century ago.  But the Celtic element remains strong - Molly Murphy is an individualist with a strong sense of self and the ability to cut through waffle, semi-truths and untruths so she can pick out the germane and the useful. Molly has the Celtic gift of insight and the ability to make leaps of the imagination, leaving logic far behind.<br />She is a fine character, this Molly, saddled also with imperfections, including that imagination which is at times TOO vivid. Strong characterization is this writer's greatest asset. The setting, especially the class system of New York a century ago, the dialogue, the pacing are all good but it is the true-to-themselves characters that lift this book out of the ordinary.<br />The plot is unusual and well-conceived and the truth remains hidden almost to the end. The historical period and geographic setting combine to strengthen  the dramatic tension.<br />But read the book for the pleasure of Molly Murphy's uppity-ness in a time and place that did not sanction the uppity. Read it for a look at life in Greenwich Village a century ago, and enjoy Molly's proud new &quot;parents&quot;, Sid and Gus.	2003-10-28

As in the previous six, the historical background of this book has been meticulously researched. Previously the speech, social customs,  dress and day-to-day lives of the period had been carefully researched. Increasingly however the national history, notably the war against the French, has been brought to the forefront and in this book the espionage and naval history of the period are featured. <br />In addition to the meticulous research the setting, especially the ruins of Netley Abbey and the tunnels beneath it are well drawn and effective. The characterization is good and the developing relationship between Jane and Lord Harold Trowbridge intrigued even a curmudgeon like me.<br />So why did I find the book tedious? It plodded from one none-too-exciting drama to the next with murders, arson and vicious personal attacks following unsatisfactorily along. Perhaps Jane was just a little too far out of her element. Perhaps her social awareness and the nuances that are her strength were just lost in what might have been an action-packed spy story.<br />Should there be other books in the series I hope Jane will return to the drawing rooms and ballrooms where her talents can flourish in greater congruence with the plot and the action of the story.	2003-10-11

It takes a really exceptional American writer to wean me away from my favourite English historical mysteries, but Nancy Pickard is such a smooth and accomplished writer that I can't resist her books. I just don't know what took me so long to find them.<br />It doesn't matter what aspect of mystery writing you consider, this writer can handle it flawlessly. She hooks in the reader effortlessly, her sense of place is awesome, and my pea brain doesn't get the characters muddled up, one with the other. The plot, the pacing, the motivation - it's all extremely well done.<br />In this story Jenny Cain moves to New York to fill in for her murdered friend Carol and there she finds a confused and confusing place, with characters to match. Her own personal battle - to stay there or return home to a quiet backwoods town - is the underlying counterpoint to the more immediate dangers she faces as she tries to discover how Carol met her death.<br />It's a book you won't want to put down.	2003-10-07

His television show \\"Gardening in America\\" is watched by millions who appreciate his down-to-earth, practical gardening advice. Reading this book is much like watching his T.V. show - he shares information in a very relaxed, direct fashion. The advantage of the book is that the reader can keep checking back whenever the information is required.<br />The writer has organized his material well, moving from a general topic - landscaping - to chapters on different categories of plants, trees, shrubs, bulbs etc., with a final couple of chapters on composting and protecting plants from creatures. Each chapter has been further divided into sections and sub-sections so the search for information is simple. Better still, the information is supplied in digestible nuggets so the reader doesn't have to plough through excess verbiage.<br />Much of the book is taken up with \\"encyclopedias\\", for example \\"shrub encyclopedia\\", which takes up almost half of the 48 pages given to shrubs. These are not encyclopedias, of course, they're just plant lists with some helpful notes beside each species. I'm not a great fan of plant lists, even when they're called encyclopedias, they appear to me to be just an easy way to fatten out a book.<br />That, said, this is a very useful and readable book for the gardener in the Pacific North West. Buy it for your garden library - you'll find yourself using it often.	2003-10-06

He then moved to Exeter where he was employed to design and later maintain the landscape of a grand park belonging to Sir Thomas Dyke of Acland. On the recommendation of Sir Thomas he designed other parks around the country and, still in charge of the Acland estate, grew trees in his own nursery and sold them to his clients. His son, James inherited this entrepreneurial spirit and flair for plant propagation and he opened a new, larger nursery in the centre of Exeter. James' son, James Junior, later built a large and fashionable nursery in London to expand the family's plant empire. From these nurseries the Veitches sent out plant hunters to North and South America, Japan, China, India and the South Seas. Their most famous collectors were the brothers William and Thomas Lobb who overcame immense difficulties to discover unknown plants and send them home to England. Once in Veitch's hands they were coaxed back to health after the rigors of the voyage, propagated and likely also hybridized - the Veitches produced the first orchid hybrid.<br />The story of the Veitch family, and the Lobbs, sheds light on a fascinating era in garden history when the variety of plants available to the gardener was expanding rapidly and gardening itself expanded to the growing middle classes in the cities. The book is well researched and thorough, although one gets the sense that the writer was slightly swamped by her topic and included rather too much detail.

The characters and dialogue are so sharply observed and clearly limned that they no longer seem like characters and dialogue, but part of your world. The setting is Florida. I've never been there, but now I know the feeling of the place.<BR>The story starts with the death of a minister's wife. He is a charismatic, widely respected man of high moral principles, but he may have been cheating with a beautiful woman, a member of his congregation. The plot has depth and many unexpected twists and the sleuth is a woman that most women will be able to identify with. The writer uses viewpoint in an original way (or variety of ways) and this makes the tale more immediate and dramatic.<br />I loved this book as a good story well told, but I was even more impressed with the way the writer adressed the moral dilemmas surrounding the issue of capital punishment. No preaching. No moralizing. Enjoy the story and draw your own conclusions.	2003-09-30

Who likely lives in this little eco-system you have created, who dines on your favourite plants and who eats the diners. themselves. <br />Take aphids, for example (please!). One aphid can give rise to 1300 more aphids within 14 days. Luckily these aphids are eaten at a great rate by hover flies, lady bugs and chickadees. One hover fly alone can eat 50 - 60 aphids a day and a ladybug can eat several thousand in its lifetime. Or take slugs. In England there may be as many as 200 slugs per 11 square feet of land. Their only enemies, apart from gardeners, seem to be a few species of birds and large beetles. But there exist microscopic creatures called nematodes that almost invisibly attack and kill slugs.<br />If you are interested in nature study, or in knowing what really is going on in your own, carefully created, eco-system this book will intrigue you. It contains a wealth of information about the complex web of life that is your garden. The writers are sharing a a vast store of knowledge and understanding, yet the book is very readable.<br />The generous section on \\"Gardens for Children\\", his specially built school pond and his pleasure in finding diverse life forms beneath the lid of a garbage can (dustbin, if you're English)  specially placed in some rough grass speak to the senior writer's sense of wonder. His volume of research and clearly presented information speak to his science-based knowledge.	2003-09-30

A classic unconventional, independent, rebellious historical figure augured well for a new detective. Unfortunately neither the character of the protagonist nor those of the million or so other characters are drawn well enough for the reader to care the least bit about what happened to them. Well-known Londoners of the time, Samual Pepys for instance, are dragged in to a quick sketch, then left.<br />The plot is contrived, but by the time I came to the denoument I no longer cared. And this is all too bad because the writer has a nice wit and a good turn of phrase. I'd like to see this writer try something a little less ambitious.	2003-09-22

Perennials - flowers that bloom year after year - are the backbone of many gardens. However many people with small city lots hesitate to grow larger perennials, fearing they might appear out-of-scale with the size of the property. I was one of those people until I got tempted by lupins, red hot pokers and foxgloves. (Too bad, I thought, if passers-by couldn't see the house for the flowers. In fact the larger flowers make a dramatic statement and draw attention rather than hiding the house.)<br />So I was encouraged when the writer mentioned that she also grew large perennials on a very small lot. The perennials described in the book usually reach a height of five feet or more, and are often placed at the back of the border so they don't hide smaller plants.  The writer is knowledgeable on the topic of larger perennials and the first 40 pages discuss where and how to plant, plant care, propagation, and pests and diseases.<br />The remaining 100 pages are a plant directory of tall perennials, nicely illustrated with color photographs. The description of each plant has all the information the gardener needs about height, spread, light requirements, and soil and drainage preferences. The writer also gives suggestions for combination plantings and offers advice on topics such as staking requirements and how to keep pets at bay.<br />Buy this book for someone who is fairly new to gardening. It may encourage them to take a step towards bolder and more structural plantings.	2003-09-18

In this case it's a country house owned by the family of an English poet and a house that will soon be expanded into a museum. Except that a body is unearthed on the potential site of the new building. Not to worry - the body's been there almost a century, but of course its discovery is followed by other, highly contemporary murders.<br />Into this blend of family secrets, academic jealousies and the out-and-out bitchiness of the board of trustees there is woven a central plot that reflects the history of the house and a number of sub-plots that are purely contemporary and carry the story forward at a cracking pace.<br />But it is the strongly drawn characters that make this mystery a winner. All the characters are three dimensional and true to life, especially the women who are prominent in the story. (I couldn't believe the writer was male until I saw his photo on the back jacket.) The female characters, especially Carole the sleuth-in-chief, appear real right down to the working of their minds and the emotional spin they give to seemingly unimportant events. Linked to that the dialogue is sharp and edgy and the personal interactions are articulate and witty.<br />From the first dreadful meeting of the museum trustees to the climax where the final victim has a crumb of ginger cake at the corner of his mouth the characters in this story will carry you delightfully along.	2003-09-18

Allen Smith's Garden Home: Creating a Garden for Everyday Living	Books	4	15	16	N	N	From design principles to practical reality	This is an excellent book for anyone interested in gardening or landscape design. The sub-title is \\"Creating a garden for everyday living\\" and the writer takes the concept of \\"garden rooms\\" a step further than most designers. Dividing a garden into so-called \\"rooms\\" is not a new concept and it's easy enough to see that a vast garden such as, say, Sissinghurst is much more manageable when divided into smaller units.<br />It's not as easy, though, to visualize an ordinary city garden in terms of rooms. The writer helps us make this transition by using his own city garden as an example. This spans two city lots, so it's wider than most, but he shows how he has taken each axis and divided it, yet allowed each room to flow into the next. In the first part of the book the writer explains how he went about planning them and how each of the rooms developed.<br />The second section of the book defines twelve principles of design and gives examples and illustrations of each. These clearly and simply presented principles - from color to shape and form and not forgetting whimsy and mystery - offer down-to-earth and practical ideas.<br />The third section, which for some reason is printed on different paper and has no illustrations other than sketches, offers more of the writer's thoughts on the application of the twelve design principles.<br />The content of this book is well thought out and well presented, and the color photographs in the first two sections are generous and relevant. My quibbles are - first, the strange presentation of the third section as if the book designer decided to make it as dull as possible so no-one would read it. Second, the fact that in the list of U. S. gardens to visit there isn't a single one listed from the Pacific Northwest.<br />Two other things bothered me. The first is the writer's glee at associating himself with Lord and Lady Ashbrook of Arley Hall in England (Local boy makes good!! Entertained by nobility!!) The second is having the writer's photograph prominent on the front cover. Yes, he's cute, and yes, I like eye candy as much as anyone else, but that was a bit much. Whatever sells books, I guess, but I felt it cheapened a very valuable addition to the gardener's library.	2003-09-16

She wastes no time introducing her sleuth, Bailey Weggins, and her plot, murder at an elegant spa in rural Massachusetts. The sleuth is a sharp-tongued and witty magazine writer - one of the more interesting and provocative female sleuths to come down the pike in a long time.<br />The plot and sub-plots are complex, unusual and well thought out.  The characters, from the slightly shady husband to the murdered staff member who offered just a little extra to some of her massage clients, were totally believable. If I was to offer a suggestion it would be that more of the characters be developed more fully.<br />The dialogue is sharp and edgy and the conflict, both internal and external, is well maintained throughout. The pacing is crisp, working to a surprising and satisfying climax.<br />The writer really has a handle on all the aspects of writing detective fiction. It's a treat to read a who-dun-it and not have to cringe at an overdone setting or a poorly thought out plot. She has put together a great read. She's a professional, and it shows.	2003-09-13

The topic is a huge one, especially as the writer refuses to be constrained by the contributions of any one country. Most of the leading writers on roses have been American, English or French. The writer adds in the considerable contributions of rose growers in Australia, Germany and Italy as well as other countries.<br />Despite difficulties in taxonomy and in tracing the history of each rose, the writer has included some 1600 currently grown climbing and rambling roses. I was happy to see an explanation of the differences between the two. Climbers have a small number of stiff stems. Ramblers have a larger number of more pliable stems, and these often trail along the ground. To confuse the issue, some ramblers are known as semi-climbers, and some small climbers are known as \\"pillar roses\\". Let's confuse it even further - climate can make a considerable difference in growth. A rose that is a climber in one country may be a shrub in another.<br />The writer is Director of England's National Rose Society and he has an encyclopaedic knowledge of the topic as well as the resources to research it throughout the world. The book covers the origin and history of each of the roses and the reader learns about the people and circumstances behind each of the different varieties.<br />The colour photographs of the roses, taken by the author in gardens around the world, are exceptionally fine Each rose is identified, of course, but we also find out in which garden and which country the photograph was taken.<br />This is a book for the gardener who loves roses. It contains a vast amount of information, well organized and presented.	2003-09-13

The result is the kind of thing you see on sale at Home Depot or one of the other big box retailers.<br />Each \\"recipe\\" for a container design has a colour photo of the mature planting, a planting diagram and notes on the plants, containers and care. These notes are repetitive because of the limited range of containers and plants.<br />The writer is described as president of a marketing communications firm for the horticulture field. The marketing is more in evidence here than the horticulture.	2003-09-10

It is, after all, one of the largest aspects of most suburban homes, it's what the visitor and the passer-by sees first - and those first impressions are so-o-o important. And most home owners are not too happy with their lawn. It has bare spots, moss, weeds and the track left by the paper delivery person. These home owners need \\"The Lawn Bible\\".<br />Written by Fenway Park's master groundskeeper, who has faced more grass issues than the rest of us put together, it has everything the grass-grower needs to make him or her the lawn meister of the neighbourhood. The writer starts by taking a look at a single grass plant and moves on to discuss the most basic element of a good lawn - the soil. He discusses seeding, instant lawns, watering, mowing (including your own design of stripes) replacing old lawns, weeds, insect pests and diseases. There is no question I could think to ask about lawns and grass that isn't addressed in this book, and all the information is arranged logically so I wouldn't have to spend too much time searching. For anyone who needs further information there is a list of Internet resources at the end. <br />I'm usually a bit wary of books calling themselves \\"The Bible of....\\" but this book really provides all the leadership and advice you need about lawns. Written by a master whose lawns and grass are wide open to the criticism of thousands each week, you can be confident the book is authoritative. It also has quotes from groundskeepers of other well-known sports fields. <br />If your lawn doesn't look good to you, invest in this book. It's readable, the material well arranged and presented, and it tells you all you'll ever need to know about lawns.	2003-09-06

Most of the gardeners I know love to get their hands in the dirt and work at whatever it takes to make their garden beautiful. But there comes a time to sit back, either alone or with friends and family, and just enjoy what you have created. This book gives you plans for twenty shady retreats where you can sit back, relax and just enjoy.<br />Each of the 20 retreats is shown in a painting by Gary Palmer (the idea of a painting rather than a photograph is a novel approach and it worked well with this topic) and a detailed design layout is provided too. I would have found it helpful if more construction details were included, but this is an idea book rather than a how-to book.<br />The strength of this book lies in the recurring themes such \\"Colour in the Shade\\" and \\"Ideas for Great Design\\" that enrich each of the major designs. There are also ideas of plants to selct for each and a goodly list of favourite shade plants at the end of the book.<br />The illustrations throughout the book are right on target with the theme and illustrate ways to incorporate your own requirements - peace? an active area? a working space? entertaining? - into a design for a shady retreat.<br />Definitely a reward book. Every gardener deserves a shady retreat like these.	2003-09-06

Set in the West Country of medieval England, the story uses the remote moorland setting to good advantage as Sir Baldwin and his friend Simon investigate the death of a young lad who was said to have fallen under a cart. This was a common enough occurence, hardly something for the Keeper of the King's Peace to investigate. But this lad, who recently inherited a large estate on the death of his father, had many enemies - starting, apparently with his mother.<br />This book has an unusually intriguing cast of characters, from the evil yet all-too-human priest to the charming foreign knight who is not what he appears to be. Even the children in this book are characters to be reckoned with. If you enjoy the medieval mystery buy not just this book but the whole series.	2003-09-03

Marylyn Abbott's \\"Gardening with Light and Colour\\" is such a book. Ms Abbott has not one but two world class gardens - at opposite sides of the world. One is a lovly old English garden that she restored and the other is in the highlands of New South Wales, near Sydney, Australia.<br />The writer stated out gardening in Australia where seasons change abruptly, there are long spells of 30 degree heat and the sunlight is strong and harsh. Given the opportunity to restore an English garden blessed or cursed with the English damp and misty climate she says \\"I did not even have the sense to be terrified.\\"<br />Where she found the energy to create and maintain, even with paid staff, TWO such gardens, and write a book I cannot imagine - but I'm glad she did. (Maybe she had nothing to do on the plane flying back and forth.) This is one of those rare boos that delivers exactly what the title promises; in this case how light and colour in two very different locations affect the choices made in landscape design and plant selection.<br />The writer has organized her material into eight chapters. The first five each feature a colour, or related group of colours and offer ideas on how best to incorporate them. Chapter Six, \\"A Rainbow Garden\\" is about potager gardening and working with the colours of vegetables and herbs. The last two chapters, \\"Light, Shade and Colour\\" and \\"Sparkling Light\\" talk about ways to work with the colours that already exist around the garden - the house walls, the colour of the soil, the foliage of large trees, shady places, winter light and the light reflected from water.<br />The tone of the book is light and conversational. The writer is knowledgeable without being infallible. She explains some of her mistakes and what she has learned from them so the reader is less likely to spend time energy and money making similar mistakes.<br />Theillustrations are sensational, possibly the best I've seen in a gardening book. Not only are they great photography but they actually relate to he text.<br />This is a book both to enjoy and to learn from. Buy it for yourself or as a gift for a gardening friend..	2003-08-31

He himself has two gardens - a balcony with a couple of pots in London and a \\"real\\" garden, one acre in size on the border between England and Wales. <br />The cover blurb says that \\"This book is written for the enthusiastic gardener keen to master the art of planting\\". Well, that would describe me (and most of the gardeners I know). I picked up the book with great anticipation, expecting to enjoy it and learn a good deal from it. Unfortunately I found it a disappointment. Certainly I learned from it - one can always pick up some ideas and pointers - but not nearly as much as I'd hoped. Either I know practically everything about gardening (fat chance!) or this writer really let his readers down.<br />On the positive side, this writer is familiar with gardening trends in Europe and across North America as well as in England. He is able to explain the variations found in the different areas and how well they work out. This, to me, is the most interesting aspect of the book. As for the rest, I'm sorry but I found it just plain boring. Even the illustrations are pedestrian and not well connected to the topic of the page. There is a short reading list at the end.<br />This is what I call a \\"name dropper book\\". Much of it reads like this .....some of the best roses/firs/grasses I've seen are at the spacious manor home of my friend Monica Smythe-Pomphrey near the elegant spa town of Bath, although Major Francis Rex Fitzroy also has fine ones on his family estate south of St Albans..... <br />Maybe I'm just jealous. On the other hand, I'd like to know what &quot;real gardening&quot; actually is. The writer places great emphasis on selecting the right plant for your climate, soil, site and the latest trend. That is important, but it does not define real gardening. Perhaps a more tightly focussed title would have helped in the production of a more useful book.	2003-08-25

In this, the fourth book of the series, she feels obligated to rush to the rescue of the drunken son of her cleaning lady who is wrongly accused of stealing some dollhouse furniture.<br />Now, as an expatriate English person living in North America, I'm kind of sensitive to an American writing an English who-dun-it. I like that this writer, writing in the first person, remains American and doesn't try to be British, even though she tries to out-Brit the Brits by wearing a succession of outlandish hats. I don't mind that she looks down her nose at some aspects of British life and is thoroughly confused by others (I do the same myself here). I really like the way she accepts her age and all that goes with it, including the stiff knees and the way young people patronize her (boy, do I empathize with that). All in all, this is an experienced writer who makes the reader identify with her protagonist.<br />This is a thoroughly competent book, and a good read. It  takes a lot of confidence to have your sleuth fall asleep in the middle of the climax and the big chase scene. I shall look for some more of Jeanne M. Dams books.	2003-08-25

The writer seemed to spend so much time elaborating on the settings - a craft fair at a Revolutionary War battle re-enactment - that she had no energy left to develop her characters. I would happily have traded several pages of information about craft sales and battle enactment strategies for some decently developed characters. As it is, there are a couple of bad people, a whole lot of bland but nice people and a pair of oddballs for light relief. Whatever happened to complex characters who don't obviously wear black hats or white hats?<br />Having said that, I'll say that the writer has a pleasant light touch and her sense of humour and practicality shine through. The basic plot is good, but the subplots could have been developed a little further. I liked the juxtaposition of the high-tech computer world with the craft fair and historic background. I also liked the concept of the weaselly cop. We meet a variety of unpleasant cops in the cozy who-dun-it genre but I can't recall a truly weaselly one before.<br />Now if only Meg's handsome heart throb would develop a mind of his own and some backbone to go with it.....	2003-08-25

If you enjoyed that, you will enjoy Rhys Bowen's \\"Evans\\" series. Like Hamish, Evans is a policeman in an out-of-the way village (this one in Wales) who has a sharp eye, an even sharper mind and an intuitive understanding of human strengths and frailties. He is not without his own frailties, either - confusion about the opposite sex being one of them, and his misadventures in this area add colour to the story.<br />The writer handles the setting deftly, managing to blend the ancient Druid culture, the recent history and current feelings in Wales with the immediacy of the New Age centre where much of the action takes place. <br />This is an easy read. Visiting with Evans and Bronwen and Betsy is like a weekend in the country - you kick back and relax. The main plot and sub-plots fit together neatly and the rivalry between the two chapels (which has nothing to do with anything except getting the feeling of place spot on) brings back fond memories of a stay in Wales.<br />There isn't a huge amount of dramatic tension here - you wouldn't expect it in a cozy - and I enjoyed the one dramatic climax when our hero, at great personal risk, manages to rescue, not the free world, not life as we know it, not even the maiden in distress, but a rabbit.  Lovely!	2003-08-20

The series had a rather slow start, with a really interesting concept - the first Queen Elizabeth and a small band of loyal friends solving mysteries - but initially rather forgettable characters. Now the writer has hit her stride and the characters are much more believable and the dialogue both truer and livelier.<br />With each new book the characters have developed depth and have moved in a natural life progression. The setting is as accurate as it can be 500 years later (and I'm from England, I can spot an American writers' innaccuracies right away). Most of all, it's a tale well told.<br />I can see the writer's difficulty. She strives to include historical characters, locations, time frames and still come up with a strong and workable plot. To be honest, there are times when the plot is a bit contrived, in the effort to include all the other elements. Personally, I can accept this. I'd rather have the accuracy and the depth of research. And this writer is a great story teller, she is working with a fascinating period in history and she has peopled it with, by now, strong and likeable characters.<br />This is a good read. I can recommend this book to anyone who likes history and mystery.	2003-08-18

That's about like saying that Mother Teresa is a nun from Eastern Europe...true enough as far as it goes, but it misses the point. The writer is a gentle philosopher who loves his farm and his crops and celebrates both with all of his senses throughout the year. To read this book is to share that intense feeling about the land and growing things, along with the hope and despair that accompanies each crop.<br />In very few books do you encounter such a deep love of the land and growth of plants and sensitivity to it. Seldom do you find an understanding of the unity and wholeness of farming in its true sense. The writer incorporates his own Japanese background and the labour of his parents and grandparents and the toil of his Mexican farm laborers into his understanding of the soil, the climate, the market and most of all the fruit he grows.<br />All five senses are used to give the reader a multi-dimensional feeling of immediacy. The writer shares with us the sweat, the dust, the heat, the memories and the hopes - all the complexities of growing a truly luscious peach. This is no sentimental view of farming, but it does explore the soul of the relationship between a man and the land.<br />This book is for anyone who loves the land and understand the magic of growing things.	2003-08-17

They show the novice gardener how to make 16 water features. There are assorted fountains, including a romantic fountain, bell fountain, perpetual water tap, a cascade and a glass waterfall. There is a still pond, a wall waterspout a cascade and a natural pond. It's fairly standard stuff but there are, after all, only so many ways to present simple how-to-do-it water feature information.<br />There are useful sections on tools, materials and pumps, and you'll find plenty of illustrations, including cross-sections of the construction project.<br />There is no bibliography, just a reading list that is really tacky because it only lists other books published by the same publisher. Unless you're new to gardening I'd stay away from books published by Storey. There is nothing basically wrong with them, but they lack the depth, originality and insight  that the more experienced gardener generally seeks.	2003-08-05

Roy Vickery of the Natural History Museum in London has done a vast amount of research to produce this very readable volume.<br />While most of the book consists of an alphabetical list of plants by their common or folk names, it has two additional, and excellent, features. The first is an introductory section titled \\"Plant Lore Studies in the British Isles\\"  which establishes a very useful context both for the book itself and for further study of the topic. The writings of most of the earlier English herbalists depended largely on sources from Continental Europe, but from the time Gerard's \\"Herball\\" was published in 1597 more and more local uses of plants were incorporated. By the end of the nineteenth century many of the books on local plant uses were merely repeating previously collected information, mistakes and all. More recent work has seen the careful collection and referencing of folklore related to plants.<br />The second excellent feature is the comprehensive bibliography. It's easily the most comprehensive and wide ranging bibliography I've seen in a readable book for lay people.    If you want to do further research there's no better place to start than here.<br />The alphabetical listing of plants give their common names from diferent areas of the British Isles, along with their uses and common beliefs about the plant. It's interesting to note that some of these are remarkably constant throughout the country, while others vary widely.<br />The Oxford dictionary of Plant Lore is like a breath of the British countryside and a reminder of simpler times and a closer connection to our natural surroundings. It is without illustrations but it is a thorough and sensitive compilation of beliefs about plants.	2003-07-23

These landscape are made up of the usual tiny trees, moss and gravel, but they also contain intricate rocky \\"outcrops\\" which form the basis of the entire landscape. Her creations combine the delicacy of the tiny landscape with the ruggedness of rock and tree to unique effect.<br />The writer gives detailed instructions for making each of the landscapes, including - I kid you not - how to make all the rocky outcrops yourself. Given patience, skill and delicacy of touch almost anyone could follow these instructions and make a very attractive table top landscape.<br />The writer was born in Singapore and studied art in England. She is a judge in the bonsai category at the Chelsea Flower Show in London. She approaches her miniature landscapes from the point of view of a painter, and she incorporates the Chinese principles of Tao and the balance of yin and yang to create harmony in these beautiful miniature worlds.	2003-07-13

She has managed to illustrate the text effectively, providing photographs that are relevant and practical as well as attractive.<br />Most of the ideas for containers-found around-the-house here are pretty standard stuff, although the writer has presented tin cans and metal containers in an interesting way. Personally, I'd be afraid that plants grown in tin cans, especially the small ones like beer cans, would have their roots cooked in warm weather. Maybe in a shady spot they might be worth a try.<br />The writer gives some information about planting and watering that may be useful to the novice gardener, but mostly it's the usual drill; filling teapots, baskets boxes drawers and wooden toys with easy to grow plants.<br />There is a fairly brief plant directory and a U.S. source list for pots and plants (even though the writer is English).

(I'm not sure whether that makes me flexible, whimsical or inconsistent. Whatever.) Anne Scott-James writes such lovely smooth prose. It's not at all pretentious; it's easy to read and her words envelop her topic like a comfortable blanket.<br />She is knowledgeable. She has a lifetime of cottage gardening to draw on and understands the topic right through to her bones. She has also done a generous amount of research into the history of the cottage garden and these together give the book a depth that is seldom found.<br />So this book, that so easily could be cloyingly sentimental, is actually a historical record of the development of the cottage garden in England. Starting with medieval times the writer shows how a \\"garden\\" of a few herbs used for medicinal purposes, together with a few fruit trees grew to become, by Victorian times, a corner of the most idyllic land in all the world. The Victorian cottage garden was unabashedly sentimentalized by poets and artists who would have you believe that the flowers were always blooming and the family was always content. This disguises the truth that a labourers plot of land had to supply vegetables and fruit enough to feed his family, with perhaps a few left over for sale, as well as producing flowers. But the flowers could help the family budget too. As one old man put it \\"We sold so many bunches of snowdrops in spring that they paid the rates\\". (\\"Rates\\" are local taxes.)<br />I found this a delightful read and it added a lot to my knowledge of cottage gardening. This book will be appreciated by anyone who is interested in the English cottage style of gardening or in the history of gardens in England.	2003-07-10

The colour photographs of the Himalaya are impressive and help the reader to understand the natural environment of the plants described later. <br />The book has seven chapters. The first helps the reader understand the ecological divisions of the Himalaya and the different plant habitats. The second chapter takes a brief look at some of the plant hunters who ventured into the area and brought back new species to challenge our gardening skills. The next three chapters detail how to develop gardens to grow plants from the three main climate zones - temperate, subalpine and alpine. The final chapters cover propagation and pests and diseases. There is a list of sources for seeds and plants in both Europe and North America, a glossary, bibliography and index of plant names.<br />This book really added to my knowledge of plants. I'd never given much thought to the huge variety of plants from the Himalaya. If asked, I'd say primulas, rhododendrons and the blue poppy, Meconopsis. I had never realized how many species of Meconopsis there are. For a start you can find deep blue ones (M. x sheldonii), yellow ones (M. integrifolia).... <BR>The primula species are even more numerous and some of the orchids take your breath away. The flower photography in this book is exceptional.<br />This is not a book for everyone, but it will be a joy to the serious plantsman. The author writes clearly and knowledgeably and his depth of experience and love for his topic come across to the reader.	2003-07-08

Virago is the division of international publisher Little, Brown &amp;Co that pays serious attention to women's writing. They chose an editor who is herself a student of English Literature as well as a gardener and gave her the daunting task of selecting the most evocative writing from the pens of devoted women gardeners of the last few centuries.<br />Deciding what to leave out must have been far more difficult than choosing what to include. The editor says \\"The book aims to be useful, to inspire or amuse. But another editor, even given these three aims, might well have made an entirely different selection.\\" One choice that had to be made was that, with two exceptions, the book contains no fiction. The first exception, and the first extract, is from Frances Hodgson Burnett's \\"The sEcret Garden\\".<br />The editor has divided this anthology into ten sections, starting with \\"Weeders and Diggers\\" and ending with \\"Visionaries\\". You'll find many famous garden names in there and also some that are new to you. You'll find writers from over a hundred years ago and modern writers, writers with vast acres and paid gardeners with small back gardens and soil under their finger nails. There is a beautifully illustrated section on flower arranging (which is an advanced art in England) and bracing words written by Gertrude Jekyll in 1899 \\"\\"I have no patience with slovenly planting...\\"<br />This anthology is handsomely illustrated, showcasing the work of women photographers.

In it the author, who has restored and maintained some of England's most important gardens, shares his own garden and plant wisdom with the reader. The cover reads \\" The Garden Through the Year is an Invitation to stroll around the garden, season by season, month by month....The reader receives the benefit of Thomas's tremendous experience, delivered in the form of a conversation with an intimate friend.\\" That, together with beautiful and relevant illustrations, are what you get in this book.<br />The author sets out to tell us which plants he treasures in his garden each month of the year and how they contribute, whether by flower, foliage or bark, to the beauty of the garden at that time of year. He throws in some suggestions to help us grow the plant more successfully.<br />Mr Thomas was about 90 years old when he wrote this book so we can honestly say he is sharing a lifetime of experience with us. His knowledge of plants and how they grow is profound and he has received almost all the chief honours of the horticultural world. The pleasure of this book is that his knowledge and experience are shared in such a conversational way, as if the reader was strolling around his garden with him and he was chatting about his plants. It's not often I feel enriched by a book, but this one both enriched me and made me feel more confident about my garden.	2003-06-30

And they are characters in all senses of the word, for one of this writer's greatest strengths is characterization. Rosie and Alex and the rest of the unlikely bunch you meet in this book are not just three dimensional, they are folk you want to meet again, and soon. Perhaps after the Castlemere series, where the characters were decent, but fairly ordinary policemen, Bannister felt the need to break out and produce some truly outrageous personalities.<br />The plot involves (what else, being English) birdwatching, a retired teacher called Prufrock (shades of Dickens) and his psychic gardener. It is a well-plotted and well-paced book, and if you appreciate England and Scotland and the folk you find there you'll enjoy it.<br />But the writer's secret weapon is her sense of humour, which extends to her sharply-honed dialogue. Oh, what a wicked sense of humour. Wicked, wicked sense of humour. If her characters are off the wall, her sense of humour is what drove them up it.<br />This is a piece of light-hearted melodrama offered, tongue-in- cheek by an accomplished writer. I enjoyed it thoroughly.	2003-06-30

And any garden writer worth her (or his) salt can come up with \\"how to do it\\" and \\"plants to choose\\" text to make the ideas a practicality. So why the paucity of ideas? Why are we treated,  on pages 52 and 53, to a two-page close-up of gravel? <br />Don't waste any time on this very ordinary book about ordinary plants in ordinary containers.	2003-06-29

The writer, a respected garden historian and fellow of the Linnean Society, has chosen to divide her material into centuries. She sets the scene with a look at Roman and Anglo-Saxon approaches to gardening and plants, then gets into more detail about plant immigrants, starting with the first century of the second millennium. <br />To put the reader more clearly in the picture the writer starts each chapter (century) with a list of significant dates so we can see how historical events influenced the arrival of plants. In the twelfth century, for example, plant introductions were influenced by the Crusades as plants were brought to Britain from the eastern Mediterranean region.<br />But this is not just a book about plants; it's also about the people associated with them. Sir Thomas More, for example, who in his book Utopia envisaged a town where everyone had a garden around their home.<br />New plants are still arriving in England from around the world. A \\"living fossil\\" tree was discovered in Australia in 1994. Its Latin name is Wollemia nobilis (it was found by David Noble) and it is known as the Dinosaur pine. Plants have been arriving from every continent for centuries and shared back and forth especially to Europe and the US. Just as many new plants went from the New World to brighten English gardens, so seeds and plants were taken to North America by English settlers to create gardens in their new homeland.<br />If you enjoy reading about the background and history of plants, who found them and how they came to us, you will enjoy this book. It has a very decent bibliography and deserves a place in every plantsman's (and woman's) library.	2003-06-26

Written by well-known garden host (HGTV and PBS) Jeff Cox, it is a beautiful yet practical book that delivers exactly what the title promises.<br />The first couple of hundred pages give you ideas for using roses in a whole range of different garden settings. The remainder explains how to buy, plant and care for roses. The advice is excellent for the novice or intermediate gardener.  I give the writer full marks for not just providing a \\"directory of roses\\" - a cop-out all too often used to fill pages in garden books. Instead he shows how different types of roses can be used in the landscape.<br />The book has plenty of colour photographs showing roses used in different settings. I have to say that I was turned off by the hype on the cover. This is not a \\"ground-breaking book\\", the effects are not \\"dazzling\\" and as a guide it was useful rather than \\"inspirational\\". However, the writer has produced a practical, workman-like guide to effective landscape design using roses.<br />The book is well-designed and easy to read. I would recommend it to anyone who was thinkinf of incorporating roses into their garden.	2003-06-26

The writer carefully presents the basics of container gardening and offers suggestions for designing container gardens. There is a useful section about pests and diseases and even a short section on harvesting.<br />Almost half the book is a plant directory, color-coded, divided into herbs, vegetables and fruit, with a few recipes for each.<br />This is pretty basic stuff, but the book is well focussed and nicely illustrated. It contains the information a novice gardener needs.	2003-06-20

It's just another \\"How to Garden\\" book. There are lots of these on the market, some better than others. This isn't a good one. More than half the book is Plant Directory - the usual listing of garden plants and the rest is the usual information about planning, composting, weed control etc. There are lots of colour photos.<br />The section on planning a garden has pictures of stylized gardens surrounding little doll houses with no allowance for a driveway and no sign of neighbours. They seemed unrealistic and not helpful. I've read this writer's other book and quite liked it - not sure what went wrong here.	2003-06-17

I never thought Id enjoy a book on fungi this much. Parts of it are not a particularly easy read, but the information it contains is mind blowing. Forget terrorists; if fungi and mold decided to take out the human race it would be no contest.<br />We tend not to think of fungi as being a very important part of our world. We might occasionally have mushrooms on pizza or steak, we might notice fungi growing on an old tree or on something that has been kept too long in the refrigerator, but thats about it. In fact fungi has a vast influence in our world, from breaking down fallen trees in the forest to making our bread and beer. Have you ever wondered how dandruff was formed? Guess what plays a major role.<br />The writer, who presents often bizarre information with wit and style, reminds us that one fungi, covering 2000 acres in Oregon, is thought to be the worlds largest living organism. Even the more prosaic information comes to life in this book - I enjoyed his description of the speed a spore is catapulted from a gill.<br />Some of the most interesting sections are the mini-biographies of scientists who have researched fungi and added to our knowledge of them. There was Buller, for instance, a professor whose students called him Uncle Reggie, and Ingold who found a totally unknown kind of fungus in water. There are now over 300 species of Ingoldian fungi known and in fall you can find about 20,000 of them in every litre of brook water.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in the natural world. Youll need to expend a little effort reading the more scholarly parts of it, but youll learn some amazing stuff about fungi, mold and the scientists who discovered them.	2003-06-17

Rather less than half provides information about basic perennial gardening - planning, maintenance and pruning for example. Rather more than half is a listing of plants giving basic information about each and information about maintenance and pruning specific to the species, and related plants.<br />I found the most useful sections to be those on disbudding, pinching back, cutting back, thinning and dead-heading. I know these are all ways to encourage better blooms and healthier plants, but I've never known how much, when and with which plants. This book explains these techniques thoroughly. I've no excuses now - it's off with their heads and I'll have masses of bloom and compact healthy plants.<br />The writer has packed a ton of valuable information into this book, but it isn't the most readable book on this topic and the illustrations aren't up to the usual standard for Timber Press. The dedicated gardener, however, will find lots of ideas for refining their gardening techniques.	2003-06-10

I've seen T-shirts with the saying \\"Friends don't let friends buy annuals\\". Planting annuals sometimes seems like owning a mongrel dog on a street where all the other dogs have pedigrees. Well, I have a mongrel dog and I plant annuals, so I was happy to see Larry Hodgson's detailed and careful book \\"Annuals for Every Purpose\\".<br />Annuals are those wonderful little plants that bloom their little hearts out every growing season, being humbly content to be poked into what otherwise would be a bald spot in your garden. Still, I think many writers would think it below their dignity to produce a book about them. Larry hodgson, however, a well-known garden writer and lecturer, has produced a knowledgeable and down-to-earht book on the topic. It's one of quite a long list of books he has written, and sister to \\"Perennials for Every Purpose\\". Like that book this is very readable for the novice, but quite detailed enough for the more experienced gardener.<br />Hodgson is an old hand at presenting gardening information and this shows in the competent way he organizes his material. The first part is titled \\"Annual Gardening Made Easy\\" and it covers all you need to know from preparing the site to designing with annuals and keeping them alive.<br />The second part helps you choose the best annuals for your purpose or needs. You look at the Table of Contents to select the purpose - drought-reistant perhaps, or giants for the back of the garden - then look through that section to select the annual you think will do best. To help with your decision the writer lists basic information such as height, spread and hardiness for each species, and gives you growing tips, lists pests and diseases andgives you some recommended varieties and ideas for neighbouring plants.<br />Annuals for Every Purpose has a source list and a list of recommended reading. Kudos to Rodale for publishing a beautifully illustrated and informative book on this topic.	2003-06-10

They are not perhaps as deep but they are usually much more fun. I find it easier to identify with the main characters and the ambience of their lives is more satisfying.<br />Seven Dials, the most recent Charlotte and Pitt mystery, is for me one of her better recent books. The writer's facility for setting a scene, whether it is a society event, the slums of the east end of London or the streets of Alexandria is unparalleled. She makes her way unerringly through the mind-boggling convolutions of Victorian morality without miring the reader in its tedious virtue.<br />This is another of Anne Perry's good yarns, complete with Gracie, Aunt Vespasia and sister Emily. It is full of strong emotions, well-honed dialogue and spiced this time with Pitt's visit to Egypt.	2003-06-05

Its hard to imagine who was most fortunate - the purchasers who lucked into this masterpiece but who paid for it many times over in the toil and expense of careful restoration, or the nation who almost lost a yet another treasure to developers.<br />The Wallingers, looking for a house that was fairly close to London, but within their price range, took a chance on a most unprepossessing house. This book tells the story of the restoration of the garden to the exact specifications of Gertrude Jekyll. It must have been a daunting task. The plans themselves, once they were unearthed, were difficult to read. To be honest, they look like a bunch of scribbles and scrawls and to have deciphered them at all is a remarkable achievement.<br />This book covers the first fifteen years of the gardens re-birth. It is a detailed account, taken from Rosamund Wallingers diary, but it is written with wit and style and her frustrations and triumphs are felt rather than read. And all along you can follow the illustrations of how the garden progressed from months of ripping up and burning to the glorious borders, wild garden and rose garden of the present.<br />But this is a value-for-money book with the story of one familys life work , not just a collection of pretty garden pictures. Not many people restore gardens, we usually start off from scratch. So this is a whole new viewpoint, and there is much that we gardeners can learn from it.	2003-06-04

He has written three previous books on rhododendrons and lectured extensively. This book gives the reader an extensive background in both rhodos and azaleas, with an emphasis on proper site preparation, soils and planting and maintenance. There is a beautifully illustrated plant directory some 40 pages in length.<br />There are some 800 species of rhododendron, and thousands of hybrids. They come in all shapes and sizes from dwarf species that look almost like heather growing on a hillside to some that have leaves some three feet in length. The writer, having introduced us briefly to the geography of the rhododendron, gets down to the business of his main theme - caring for them. The book is readable and contains useful information for anyone interested in growing rhododendrons.<br />There is a glossary, a bibliography and a useful list of recommended varieties for different climates or purposes - early flowering, late flowering, scented, best pinks, reds etc. This is a thoroughly useful and attractive book.	2003-06-02

If you are interested in cartography, if you can feel the magic of maps you will be fascinated by what Alan Morantz has to say. True the examples he shares relate to Canada's history and geography, but his knowledge of how maps have been, and are, used has a breadth and depth that will take your breath away. A glance down the Table of Contents gives just a clue - Survival, Misdirection, Exploitation and Seduction are just a few of the chapter titles. And the writer delivers the goods in each chapter.<br />If you are interested in the world of maps, whether they offer fact of fiction, you will both enjoy and learn from this book.	2003-05-30

To be sure, there is the thatched cottage, the vicar, the doctor and the district nurse plus a cast of other worthy individuals. But this village has a cleaning lady with attitude and a certain lack of respect for worthiness.<br />The writer is no stranger to writing books about life in an English village, and this experience with the setting and the characters stands her in good stead here. Unlike other writers who only dream their English village, this one actually knows what they, and their inhabitants, are like.<br />The plot is sound, the pacing is good and the dialogue is first rate - one of the best features of the book. It was a fun read - I look forward to reading more mysteries by this writer - and finding out what happened between the cleaning lady and that dishy policeman.	2003-05-30

You either get a racy, fast-moving story that's light on the research or an extensively researched story that plods along bogging down in details. James Ruddick, however, did all the research but has not bored the reader with unnecessary detail.<br />He also gives us just enough background to the story, especially the Victorian attitudes to women and their appointed &quot;place&quot; in society. It's enough to make you gnash your teeth, and certainly enough to make you sympathize with the women in the story. <br />I started this book with no great expectations, but I found myself reading it when I should have been occupied elsewhere.

This is a book of short, readable essays about gardening with native plants. Its a how-to manual telling you how NOT to spend your weekends cutting grass. The writer, who lives in Texas, uses native plants of that state to illustrate her points, but its easy enough for people living elsewhere to substitute local species. Because not only does she tell us that lawns are an ecological wasteland, she goes on to show the reader that many of our garden plants are brought in from other countries and other regions. Not only are they unsuited to our local area and prone to die because they are not used to our soil and climate, but they lead us to ignore equally lovely plants that are at home in our region and perfectly suited not only to our climate and soil but also to our local ecology. They have adapted over hundreds of years to feed and shelter our local wildlife.<br />The writer, a landscape designer, writer and teacher has a crisp style and keeps her essays short and salted with humour. She has an understanding not just of the ecological blind spots of our times, but of how they came to be. She makes her case for greater ecological responsibility convincingly, with the added incentive of ecologically sound gardening being much less work. So why are there so many green deserts in our suburbs?	2003-05-28

The gardeners, in residence only for the summer months, battle against vast outcroppings of rock, frequent dessicating winds and nightly visits from hungry wildlife. It made me believe that I garden in the lap of luxury with only a few winter gales and the occasional mole. But then I don't have the resources to bring in barge loads of topsoil, as these gardeners seem to do, so I guess it all evens out. <br />This is a pleasant read for a cold wet evening.

This is the first book I've seen that focuses on SMALL water gardens. Usually I find that books on water gardens show a couple of small ones then go on to plan something they call a pond and I call a lake. I don't have space for a lake, but I do like having a water feature. Better still, I like two of them. <br />So I learned a lot from Yvonne Rees' book which gives careful plans, including construction suggestions for 20 small water gardens. Whether you build them inside or outside is up to you. Well illustrated, this book has information on plants and fish that will work well with each water garden, as well as tips for maintaining it. At the end of the book is a list of suppliers in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand. <br />The first chapter, &quot;Before You Start&quot;, helps you face up to some of the aspects of installing a water garden that you might not have considered. You need, for instance to consider the placement carefully. Where can the water garden best be seen? Where will it best fit into the rest of your garden? Where can guests enjoy it as you entertain, or where can it be a secret hideaway, just for you? If you would like a fountain or waterfall, where is the nearest electrical outlet? <br />The strength of this book lies in its practical advice for constructing raised or sunken water gardens. Most water gardens, except for those in pots, must be either raised or sunken and much of the success of either is based on careful planning and meticulous construction. Once the basics are safely in place you can relax and enjoy adding the finishing touches - you can make your water garden lush, or natural, contemporary or classical or combine the features of each that please you. You can add fountains, pebbles, plants or statuary. Making it into your dream pond is up to you. This book shows you how to tackle the project and how to adapt basic water features to your ownstyle.<BR> <BR>Some of the water gardens are fairly complex and you might find yourself calling in a contractor if you are not accustomed to construction projects. But all of the 20 designs can be adapted to simpler ponds, and all have a &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; page showing how the work is done. <br />So if you have been dreaming of a water feature, but you didn't think you had enough space, or you didn't know what kind, or how to go about making it - enough with the excuses.

It's not just the practical uses - wood to build our houses, wheat, cabbages and apples to eat, oak for our ships - plants have had strong spiritual value too. Our religions have given us the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil in the Garden of Eden, the Ceiba tree of the Mayans, the Bodhi tree (fig) or Tree of Enlightenment of the Buddhist religion and \\"Yggdrasil' (ash) the Norse world tree whose roots reached the Underworld and whose branches reached the heavens. Then there were the sacred oaks of the Druids - don't get me started.<BR>Michael Jordan (no, not the athlete) has put together a masterly piece of research into the uses, practical and spiritual, of trees, plants and herbs of all kinds, in civilizations around the world. The book is well illustrated, using many of Jordan's own photographs. <BR>In his overview of great writings about herbs Jordan quotes Charlemagne's definition of a herb \\"The friend of physicians and the praise of cooks.\\" The oldest existing record of the use of herbs in medicine comes from Babylonian times, some 1700 years before Christ. The Chinese, however, were probably the first people to write \\"herbals\\" or documents about the uses of herbs. <BR>A Greek philosopher, Theophrastus, was the first European to take a stab at classifying plants in 372 BC. His work strongly influenced other botanists for almost 2000 years. As recently as the 18th century the use of herbs in medicine was very hit or miss. Some pain killers, such as salicin, from the willow, were well-known and effective. Other nostrums relied on superstition - haemorrhoids were treated with a plant called Lesser Celandine because its roots were the shape of haemorrhoids. <BR>It wasn't till the early 19th century that pure drugs such as morphine and quinine were extracted from plants. Meanwhile from time immemorial housewives had been growingherbs in their gardens and treating their family's illnesses with lore learned from their mothers and grandmothers. The church and paid physicians were not happy about this so they resorted to burning a few \\"wise women\\" as witches. <BR>But Jordan does not restrict himself to actual real plants, he has a whole chapter on \\"Plants of the Imagination\\" which looks at plants featured in legend and mythology. In the Middle Ages it was said that a Barnacle Tree existed whose fruits matured into birds. In England it was said to grow at the edge of the sea and its fruits were barnacle shellfish. When these matured and fell off they split open, grew feathers and became Barnacle geese. <BR>In his conclusion Jordan looks at gardening throughout the ages and ponders the possible effects of global warming and climate change on our \\"Green Mantle\\". He is hopeful that a new respect for our land and our environment is emerging and that the plunder of the Green Mantle is becoming less acceptable. Yet we are still losing plant species throughout the world. The Sahara desert is encroaching on vast areas that once were green; the forests of South America are being slashed and burned at an insane pace. <BR>Jordan is hopeful, as I am, that our headlong race to destroy our Green Mantle may have been checked slightly. We have more knowledge now and even a little more understanding. We have made some small steps towards preserving our plant heritage. Will it be enough to counter the forces of ignorance and greed?	2003-05-16

But then, I never knew the mint family (Lamiaceae or Labiatae) was such a huge one. It includes 67 genera, of which the commonest are lavender, oregano, nettle, thyme, bugle and rosemary.<br />Barbara Perry Lawton is a well-known garden writer in the US whose concise, factual style helps her pack a ton of information into each page. Much of her extensive research was done at the Missouri Botanical Garden, which reminded me what a huge asset a good botanical garden is in any community. I also learned that the Missouri Botanical Garden has a world-class collection of early (pre-Linnaean) botanical books. Some of the illustrations in this book are reproduced from drawings made over 400 years ago and they are what helps to make this book unique.<br />The writer has organized her material well, starting with the history of the mint family and moving on to discuss herbal mints, ornamental mints, weedy mints. After short sections on pests and the botany of mints the writer moves to ?Catalogue of Mints? which takes up about half of the book. This contains useful descriptions of most of the genera and many of the species within them, nicely illustrated with line drawings.<br />There is a brief glossary, three pages of suggestions for durther reading and an index of plant names.<br />This is a professionally written and well-researched book, and deserves a place on the book shelf of anyone interested in herbs or botany.	2003-05-14

This is the first book I've seen that focuses on SMALL water gardens. Usually I find that books on water gardens show a couple of small ones then go on to plan something they call a pond and I call a small lake. I don't have space for a small lake, but I do like having a water feature. Better still, I like two of them. <br />So I learned a lot from Yvonne Rees' book which gives careful plans, including construction suggestions for 20 small water gardens. Whether you build them inside or outside is up to you. Well illustrated, this book has information on plants and fish that will work well with each water garden, as well as tips for maintaining it. At the end of the book is a list of suppliers in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand. <br />The first chapter, \\"Before You Start\\", helps you face up to some of the aspects of installing a water garden that you might not have considered. You need, for instance to consider the placement carefully. Where can the water garden best be seen? Where will it best fit into the rest of your garden? Where can guests enjoy it as you entertain, or where can it be a secret hideaway, just for you? If you would like a fountain or waterfall, where is the nearest electrical outlet? <br />The strength of this book lies in its practical advice for constructing raised or sunken water gardens. Most water gardens, except for those in pots, must be either raised or sunken and much of the success of either is based on careful planning and meticulous construction. Once the basics are safely in place you can relax and enjoy adding the finishing touches - you can make your water garden lush, or natural, contemporary or classical or combine the features of each that please you. You can add fountains, pebbles, plants or statuary. Making it into your dream pond is up to you. This book shows you how to tackle the project and how to adapt basic water features to your own style.<BR> <BR>I have to admit I got carried way mentally designing different ponds based on the author's ideas and, as I said, I already have two water features in a tiny garden. I was especially drawn to the herb tray. It was a long wooden box partitioned into three or five sections. The middle section contained a terra cotta pot, set in gravel, with a tiny fountain bubbling in its centre. <br />The other sections had similar pots sunk in gravel, each containing herb plants. In the book the author suggests a windowsill for this but outside you could put it in any sunny location with access to electricity for the fountain pump. The author shows you, with simple diagrams, how to make the box and the water feature and she suggests some herbs that would work well in this setting. Et Voila! A herb garden and a water feature in a very tiny space. <br />Some of the water gardens are much more complex than this and you might find yourself calling in a contractor if you are not accustomed to construction projects. But all of the 20 designs can be adapted to simpler ponds, and all have a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" page showing how the work is done. <br />So if you have been dreaming of a water feature, but you didn't think you had enough space, or you didn't know what kind, or how to go about making it - enough with the excuses. Get this book, and get started on your water feature.	2003-05-14

The author has covered all the planning bases in a down-to-earth, practical style. <br />Written by a garden designer whose tiny gardens have won awards at the famed Chelsea Flower Show in England, this book has a wealth of ideas for gardens, courtyards, rooftops and alleyways - all presented with the eye of the artist. <br />She spends time helping the reader deal with the elements of a small garden that a reader might be stuck with. She offers ideas for gardens that might be too shady, too hot, too exposed, cursed with clay soil, overlooked by a hideous brick wall, or containing ugly sheds, manhole covers and electricity meters. Not only are the ideas suggested, but at the back there is a how-to-do-it section to help you make the vision a reality. I found this very valuable. It's all very well saying &quot;Hide an ugly brick wall with a trellis covered with vines&quot;, but how do you get a trellis to stand up against a brick wall? This book explains it. <br />Then having dealt with the problems, she moves along to the possibilities. These is so much you have to choose when you plan any garden, and a tiny space takes more planning than most. Would you like formal or informal? Crammed with plants or restrained? Would you like to &quot;borrow&quot; the surrounding scenery or exclude it at all costs? Jill Billlington will take you through the planning for the garden of your dreams. <BR>Lest you thought that gardening was a pastime for gentle souls, in the chapter titled &quot;Illusion&quot; the author has included sections on concealing, exploiting and trickery. It sounds more like Las Vegas than Chelsea Flower Show. But this is where she gets down and dirty with concrete ideas for hiding anything you don't want to see and drawing to everyone's attention the best aspectsof your garden. <br />The book has a directory of what the author calls &quot;tried, tested and dependable&quot; plants for small spaces. This includes some small trees, both deciduous and evergreen (if you should have enough space), as well as shrubs, perennials, climbers, bulbs and annuals. It ends with plans for different shapes and styles of garden and hints about how to shape plants growing beside walls and how to go about making structures such as arches and trellises to support them. <br />This is a book for anyone planning a small garden. The author's artistic approach is a revelation to gardeners like me who are not very artistic, and will be welcomed by those who are artistic and will enjoy the practical approach of a kindred spirit.	2003-05-14

Louise Riotte<br />Louise Riotte, whose popular books on companion planting Carrots Love Tomatoes and  Roses Love Garlic have sold many thousands of copies, shares some of her vast knowledge of North American gardening in this 220 page book. She starts by paying tribute to the native people who taught settlers enough about growing crops to enable them to survive and she also mentions some of the well-known early farmers and gardeners, such as George Washington, Benjamin Franklin,  John Quincey Adams and Thomas Jefferson.<br />The author has arranged her material chronologically throughout the year, but instead of naming the first chapter \\"January\\" she has chosen to use the native American name \\"Wolf Moon\\". Each month, or moon, is named for the natural events that could be relied upon - Strawberry Moon in June, Hunter's Moon in October and Cold Moon in December. In each chapter you will find gardening tales, gardening lore and gardening advice appropriate to the time of year. In January she tells the reader (among other things) about early seedsmen, about almanacs, about forcing blooms and about planting by the moon. She wraps up the month with a recipe for Oklahoma Pecan pie, made with the last of the pecans that the January wind shakes from the trees in that state.<br />This a book of garden wisdom dispensed in small doses - a little of this and a little of that. Scientific it is not, but it will deepen your understanding of plants, how they grow and how they can be used.	2003-05-08

Vivian A. Rich <br />At last! Something useful to do with the anger and frustration of rush hour! Go into your garden and curse the basil - it will help it to grow better. The author has done a great deal of research into the history of plants and their uses. Concerned, as many of us are, that the technology of the modern age will crowd out the long rich history of plants, she sets out to preserve the memories of the symbolism and significance of plants to people of earlier times.<br />This book is a gift to anyone interested in ethno-botany. It takes a thorough look at how our ancestors have used plants since the earliest days. The author has divided the book into four parts, featuring spells and rituals, traditional foods, hygiene and medicine, mythology religion and superstition, and trade and politics. There are end notes and an extensive bibliography.<br />The section about trade and politics surprised me at first but there is much to learn about the commerce of plants, from the ancient trade with Asia for spices through to tulipmania and its present day offspring the huge flower auction at Aalsmeer in Holland which covers over 333 acres. Nor did I know that an official Herb Woman attended British Coronations until 1821. By the time the following coronation rolled around the position had been eliminated due to budget restrictions.<br />A few more illustrations might have been nice, but all in all, you can't beat Cursing the Basil for its wealth of information and straightforward approach to a vast topic.	2003-05-08

Robert Osborne 1991 Key Porter 138 pages ISBN 1-55013-284-9<br />How can a book about roses come out of New Brunswick, which is known for its wicked North Atlantic winters? The author, a member of the Canadian Rose Society and of the International Plant Propagator's Society, is uniquely aware of the problems associated with growing roses in a very difficult climate .He has personal experience of the frustrations of nurturing roses through winters that can only be called challenging.<br />His aim in writing this book is to share his experiences and help northern gardeners choose the best variety of roses and nurture them to successful blooming. One of the first chapters is titled \\"Wintering\\" and he explains how some roses have adapted to cooler climates and lists groups of roses that do better than others in cold winters. He moves on to a very thorough chapter on nurturing these roses, then discusses insect pests before an excellent chapter about propagating roses.<br />The extensive chapter about different rose varieties recommended for northern winters is well illustrated with Beth Pownings' color photographs and followed by a chart detailing the characteristics of the roses recommended. Almost all the roses are hardy to Zone 4, and a few even to Zone 2. There is a useful resource list of sources in both the US and Canada.<br />Growing roses in the colder regions of Canada and the northern US is a daunting task. This book will help remove some of the mystique and reduce the frustration of rose growing in areas where winters are long and summer blooms are doubly treasured.	2003-05-07

Wister observed &quot;Even with the casual attention we have given it, the lilac is the oldest and best loved American shrub.&quot; <br />Now you might argue that the lilac is not the oldest shrub in North America, but for many people it seems like the oldest inhabitant of the gardens they knew as children. The gardens we grew up in - our parents, grand parents and great grandparents gardens all had lilacs. My grandmother had a white lilac growing in a square foot of compacted dirt - I refuse to call it soil - in an inner city neighbourhood that was as polluted as it could be. Even as a child I admired its survival skills. Yet in these days when we have a reasonable plot of ground and amended soil, how often do we choose to plant lilacs? <br />Jennifer Bennet, author of several gardening books, has done a thorough job of researching the lilac, the species officially known as Syringa. Most lilacs have come to us from the mountainous regions of Asia, although two species came from Eastern Europe to France. The French, enamoured by its perfume, transformed Syringa vulgaris into a wide variety of hybrids with larger clusters of flowers, a range of colours - from white through violet and magenta to purple. <br />Lilacs came to North America with settlers during the 17th century. Some immigrants over 250 years old still grow on Mackinac Island, Michigan where there is a lilac festival every year. Another lilac festival is held annually in Rochester New York. And if you are looking for a major collection of lilacs, check out the Arnold Arboretum in Massachusetts, which has over 500 lilacs.<br />The author, besides giving her readers a useful and detailed description of different varieties of lilac, also explains plant requirements, mulching, grafting fertilizing, stresses affecting lilacs and the best way to work with lilacs that have suffered from neglect. Her last chapter is a particularly useful &quot;Lilac Aid: Whywon't it bloom?&quot; <br />This is a well illustrated book, with most of the colour photographs taken by the author herself. There is a valuable resource list at the end, with mail order sources for the US and Canada, nurseries, public lilac collections and web sites with lilac information.	2003-05-06

Bobby Ward. Timber Press. 1999.<br />In his introduction Bobby Ward, botanist and environmental scientist asserts that writers have contemplated upon flowers since the beginning of written history, and his well-researched book proves his point.<br />This book neatly manages to balance science and art, keeping in mind both botanical accuracy and the poetic licence taken by some of the more fanciful Victorian poets. Mr Ward has researched some 82 varieties of flowers and arranged them alphabetically by their common name. You can read it in sequence if you like an orderly approach. I found myself picking out my favourite plants and discovering their ancient history as well as the way in which poets and playwrights had portrayed them. You'll always find treasures:<br />- the name `lilac' comes from Persian and Arabic words describing its color. Its Latin name `syringa' comes from a Greek word meaning `pipe' and refers to its hollow stem. Our word `syringe' comes from the same root.<br />- an ancient legend says that peonies were only to be picked at night. The woodpecker guarding them would attack the eyes of anyone picking them during the day.<br />This is that rare treat, a \\"dipping book\\". You pick out the parts that grab your interest immediately, then keep it beside your armchair to dip into as time goes on.  If you enjoy discovering more about the lore and literature of the plants in your garden you'll find \\"A Contemplation upon Flowers\\"  a treasure to be added to your bookshelf.	2003-05-06

It was so beautifully written and so informative that I became interested in orchids.<br />I had always felt that orchids were somehow a bit \\"over the top\\". I had no idea just how \\"over the top\\" they were. By the tie I read the chapter on myths and legends I was hooked, and when I finished \\"Patrons and Hunters\\" I couldn't put the book down. Just as well because I would have missed the story about vanilla being part of the Aztecs chocolate drink, and, of course, thought to be an aphrodisiac. Montezuma was said to drink it fifty times a day, especially before visiting one of his many wives.<br />The book also covers the literature and art of the orchid and the magic, medicine and religion related to it. There are also chapters on the plant, the genera and on growing orchids and a list of information and illustration sources. There are some colour photographs and, throughout the text, delicate engravings from a wide range of historical sources.<br />This is a very literate book. Not a long book - the writer does not belabour any of his points, but an interesting and thought-provoking read. If you are interested in orchids or fascinated by the history and legends of plants, this is a must read.	2003-05-06

Rick Darke<br />This is one of the most powerful books about our natural world that I have read in a long time. When I picked it up I expected nothing more that a pleasant read and some attractive photographs. This book contains far more. The author manages to combine science-based knowledge of forest ecology with the eye of the artist and the insight of a philosopher. I haven't enjoyed a tree or garden book in years and I don't even live on that side of the continent.<br />More than half the population of the U.S. lives on land that used to be one vast deciduous forest. Only a patchwork of remnants remains. Rick Darke, author of &quot;The American Woodland Garden&quot; has attempted the difficult task of writing and photographing a portrait of this forest and offering a guide for those who consider creating a woodland garden both for beauty and for their conservation value.<br />The photographs alone make this book a worthwhile purchase, especially those of the photographic study of one stretch of Red Clay Creek in Pennsylvania. The author portrays, in photographs and notes, the natural patterns and processes of this tiny section of creek that he passed daily on his way to work. He writes &quot;What began as a simple exercise in observation has proved to be one of the most essential elements in my education as a gardener.&quot; The resulting series of photographs is both simple and profound. Most of us know little stream beds like this; often we pass them routinely in our day-to-day commuting. We seldom pause to record the details - a flower is in bloom, a branch has fallen, the way one tree's foliage complements another.  But for the author there were complex lessons to be learned, not least of which was the inevitability of change in the forest. Not only seasonal changes, but the effects of high winds, heavy rain and, of course, the hand of man.<br />Make sure to read the preface to understand the author's frame of reference (I often skip it, thinking `same old, same old') but this one conveys you comfortably into the realm of the forest and into the author's world view. His first chapter &quot;A Forest Aesthetic - The Eye of the Artist&quot; shows you the colour cycles and architecture of the forest, while the second chapter is the aforementioned study of the woodland stream. The third and fourth chapters relate the spirit of the forest to the spirit of a woodland garden. The final, and longest, chapter details the plants of the woodland. <br />For the gardener or designer the lesson, beyond a deeper understanding of the woodland itself, is not to copy the forest but to reflect it, to make the most of colours, patterns and processes and to celebrate the spirit of the forest and bring it closer.<br />It would demean this book to call it a coffee table book, although the large format and superb illustrations would earn it a place on any coffee table. But by all means put it on your coffee table, because you will want it handy to pick up again and again as you keep returning to take this spiritual journey again and again with the author.	2003-02-06

Noel Kingsbury sets out to answer that question in this well-illustrated and comprehensive book.<br />Reading &quot;The Ultimate Planting Guide&quot; is rather like consulting with your own garden designer.

In his extensive section titled &quot;A Plant for Every Place&quot; he presents a series of five colour illustrations showing different approaches to a very plain, square front garden. These take you from ordinary through nice and very nice to stunning.<br />His major section on &quot;Planting Principles&quot; helps the reader understand how to combine plants and use them to best effect in different types of gardens and in various environments.
