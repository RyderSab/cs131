Overall the author did a good job. I Liked the party scenes as well as the scenes with Sabrina and her boyfriend.It was nice to see a main character not having the traditional shape but still being wanted by the opposite sex.

I am so glad I have finally stopped taking reviews so seriously because other reviewers didn't really represent for this novel. This novel although fictional spoke about very serious issues domestic violence, loyalty within friendships,family, parenting, prostitution. I mean it was just Drama but it was real life drama. The two main characters Marie and Sammie remind me of me and my best friend Michelle. I can't wait to read the sequel Law'd Mo Drama when it hits the stores in December.	2005-09-07

Well done.The character's make you either  love them or hate them.<br /><br /> Nikki the main character was a survivor she did what she had to do to make sure her and her selfish, ungrateful sister ate. Noki, is Nikki's witch of a sister. Ivanka is Noki's friend who is just crazy and I do mean crazy. Kayla is Nikki's best friend who is very good to Nikki, but Nikki doesn't realize it until it's too late. Joshua is a very talented lawyer who at the start of this book is in deep trouble because of his girlfriend Lacey who is his ex-girlfriend's twin sister.<br /><br />These are just a few of the character's that I have grown to enjoy. In some shape or form these characters lives are going to cross. AS THE AUTHOR HAS SAID DO YOU BELIEVE IN FATE.<br /><br />This book has me doing some major THINKING. I recommend this for bookclubs all over the world if you want a lively discussion read this your club will be talking about it for meetings to come.	2005-09-07

I know there are many people that are not feeling TCP for whatever reason but if an author is good they are just that no matter who their publisher is, Crackhead is an excellent debut novel. Why???? Because it is street related and could really happen and is happening everyday all over the world. I even enjoyed the quot in the begininning og the book where it states that when a person is addicted to crack they give up everything for it food,children parents and even sometimes their lives. This book was intense. If you are really addicted to books this novel will not ba waste of your money believe me when I say that it was very enjoyable.	2005-08-25

It is true that we as Afican American people try to hide mental illness within our community. So I commend Stephanie for putting this story out about a young black woman with a mental disease. Some have called this novel predictable but I beg to differ. I did not know what crazy rockin robin was going to do next. I really enjoyed this novel.

Then when he did that bull*h** at the party I put the book down. But when I picked it back up can you say WHOA SLOW DOWN COWBOY. But that's my fault cause' I know how my girl Nikki Turner gets down.

His aunt turns about to be a selfish money hungry wench who makes Sammie's life a living hell.

All these negative reviews about getting tired of reading about Mr.Black. Well I am here to tell you I hope this author writes one more story about Curtis Black. This was a very fast paced read about Mr.Black and his new wife who was just like he was back in the days. But the real message wasn't about Curtis or his wife Charlotte it was about Infidelity and it's affects on the children as well as the mistress or other party. It is about how infidelity rips apart many people's lives not just the person doing the cheating who thinks they are having a grand ole' time.

The man is just talented. Anyway........This story was fast paced and wonderfully done although different from his other novels it still has plot twists that Weber is known for, What had me really laughing was once again he threw in the character Shawna who has duped another man. You the reader would have had to read his other books to know that Shawna is a transvestite. That junk just had me on the dayuum floor.

It was written with all the drama that I have been known to enjoy as well as as plenty of plot twists and turns. I am now reading Black and this author is just doing it for me. Every avid reader of AA fiction should support this author. Nina (my namesake as well as a character in the book) seemed to be the most intelligent of the four women and the least ghetto was my heroine. The other three women had major issues but not issues that one could not relate too all in all this was worth your $$$$$$$$.	2005-02-07

The author weaves a story of a Pastor who seems to have it all together a wife that he is very faithful to even when other so called church members try to throw themselves on him. A church that he puts all his blood,sweat and tears in. But what he doesn't have is his children, for whatever reason he shuns them for his church. This book is funny,sad and just plain old good. The author also makes you the reader realize how important family is regardless of the many issues that one goes through in everyday life. This is a novel that you won't be able to put down. It is one of those reads that you have to put down in order to save some for later.	2005-01-21

She writes reality fiction. Her characters have stayed with me from each one of her novels that I have read.  We also must know that everyone can not write a sequel. She does not disappoint as she gives ys the update on old characters and introduces new characters. One new character Jerome who is courting Annette makes you want to smack him until the whitemeat shows. But he gets his in the end. Annette after all she has been through ends up blessed at the end.

But she has outdone herself in Driven. This book is filled with colorful characters Mom Flossy who holds her family down regardless. Loretta who the main characters mother. Sheena who is the main characters sister. Nakea his sneaky conniving baby's momma and Fallen his educated, classy new woman. Nasir is the main character who wants to do right but it seems every time he tries there is something or someone to hold him back. His own Momma acts as if she is his enemy at times. The only people in his corner is Mom Flossy, Sheena and Fallen. Everyone else got jokes and tricks for him. This book was very intense. I tried to read this pageturner slow but with all the true life drama I just could not put it down. This is a must read and actually deserves more stars. Kashamba is showing us what a real author does. Also if you have not read Blinded I urge you to pick that book up as well.	2005-01-11

Who needs a bunch of drama filled friends when I can just read it in a book without the hassle. This book and it's characters took me through many emotions. Veronica Black was a mess, she had a wonderful man and didn't realize it.(Which was sad).  And Mr.Player, Godpimp Terrel's head was spinning. Kayla was the only one wth minimal drama. A new character was introduced to add more spice to this book and her name is Isis Adams AKA ICE. She gives new meaning to the word classy. I can't end this review without talking about trifling butt Darla, whom without this book would have no drama. All I can say is go out and buy this book it is well worth your dough. So would I buy a blouse or this book and I would say to you any day this BOOK.	2005-01-04

Because she is so talented. All her books that I have read have been phenomenal, they have been pageturners to the point where I can't put them down. She gives you memorable characters that stay within your soul.  Ida B. for instance is real it is what is actually going on in the \\"hood\\". I know I grew up in a project much like Ida B. where everyone looked out for each other. Sure there were problems and life wasn\\"t full of apple pies but it was family. And as for the person who didn't believe the woman jumped off the roof with her children. Get this it happens in real life it happened when I was growing up.

She is having problems in her marriage due to lack of communication between her and her husband. This I feel stems from her childhood. So many secrets hidden from her make her unable to communicate effectively in her marriage. Although infidelity on her husband's part makes it even harder for Tandi.This story is set in Jamaica,Queens where I was raised. I could relate to the streets where everything was taking place. Although Mallette has a way of writing about places that I have never been but she still takes me there in her writings. Tandi also goes through betrayal by her so called best friend.<br /><br />  The only thing that was a little pet peeve of mine was the ending but it still doesn't take away from the story.	2004-12-29

I was raised In the \\"ghetto\\". So I can really relate to these reads. But just like any type of book there are some good quality and bad quality. That goes for street fiction as well. I read all types of books but now we are talking about street fiction. Nikki Turner is by far one of the best at her game. She does not disaapoint in her story. She takes you on a ride with a girl named Unique. Unique is so trifling that at times you feel sorry for her because you as the reader realize that she has low self esteem. I won't give away the story but Unique did some shyyt that had my jaw drop.<br /><br />  Then Roy Glenn takes you on another adventure with Nina. Nina is being stalked by an ex-lover. Who really tries to take things way too far.<br /><br />  Last but definitley not least we have Chunichi who does the dayyuum thing in the last story with Anyeh. This story shows true love and loyalty to family with a twist of christian fiction which I loved. Chunichi sent a messae that know matter what you been through or are going through GOD is the man in charge.  Well done to the three of you.

For such a real issue that could happen this book was not a good representation of what it could have been. I gave the author one star for having the courage to write this storyline and one star for writing certain scenes that made me believe I was in that state. But I mean come on Tracey was a monster for doing what she was doing to her child and thinking it was okay. Then to have  such a well adjsuted child as Lauren it made you wonder who was the adult. To make matters worse the author leads you to believe Tracey was pregnant by Aaron but that  storyline never goes anywhere. All I can say is it was a good try for this author but I would not recommend anybody to buy this book. Buy a Hoagie instead.	2004-11-16

Grace is a woman although fictional who seems to have reached self actualization(Maslow)at a very early age. I pray that when probems arise in my life I can also handle them like Grace. The only thing I didn't care for in this book is how Starlight is depicted because I truly believe she was trying to motivate people even though she was getting paid for it.

Like for one they are not fighting three alarm fires all the time but are mostly taking car accident calls as well as health calls. Even though I work in health care I never really thought about it.

Especially since I am not a short story kind of girl, but Mr.White has what it takes to write a short story and wrap it up very well. You don't feel like your hanging you feel full.<br /><br />  My favorite story was LOCKDOWN it was very intense and at times I felt I was the character Kye. Miles Away was another good story that had me feeling sorry for Mikhail.  Change Of Heart was the bomb and I didn't even read Fed Up With The Fanny but I now have it on order thanks to this story.

Her sisters on the other hand bashed her &quot;job&quot;but were always calling on her to hold them down when they were in trouble. Obviously this should show the reader that Tabitha AKA Tabby would hold them down no matter what the cost. See but Tabitha had her own issues as well that she never dealt with that I am assuming came from her living in foster care . But like I always say everybody has a story to tell. But can the writer tell the story. I enjoyed this book and I almost didn't read it because of all the bad press that Omar Tyree has received. I am glad I did read it, it was very good.	2004-05-26

This book was all over the place.Blinded was excellent. I don't know what this was, maybe the author was trying to get another phenomenal message across but the story was to scattered. I am sure some people will still enjoy this story but a sequel this was not,so you don't have to read Blinded first or read this after you read Blinded because it won't make any difference. I don't want this to take away from my feelings on Blinded because that still was a great book. But don't waste your money on this book. Borrow it!!!!!!	2004-05-26

She has a way of weaving a tale that makes you think you are watching a movie. Tiara was a trip with her &quot;yeah I got it like that&quot;. The only thing that was wrong with Tiara was that she was spoiled. I read another review where the reviewer states that if Tiara was all that why was she in the projects still. Hello duhh her father was working very hard I might add to get them out of their situation and also living in the projects does not mean that you have to have low self esteem. Because before I grew up and bought my own house I realized it wasn't where I lived but how I choose to carry myself. I still have friends that are single moms living in the pj's that are doing the Dayuum thing. Anyway........I am anticipating Ida B.

This book really made me feel like I was in Papermoon Montana. I enjoyed myself sitting in Jess's diner eating good homecooking from Juanita. And laughing and joking with all the townsfolk. I really felt like I was there and when Juanita left I felt the hurt because I felt like I was leaving to right with her and even though the  adventure was about to start all over again .The book was over and so was my adventure with Juanita. I think there are many women who have felt like Juanita who just wanted to pick up and go and LIVE. But this in most cases does not happen and is very unrealistic. I guess that's why it was fiction. But it still doesn't stop a sister from dreaming.	2004-04-26

I have seen this book online for years with excellent reviews but it has never really caught my eye. I happened to read an excerpt off the computer and I was open after one page. There are so many mediocre Afican American fiction books at this time that sometimes you pay good money for an enjoyable read and it ends up being a waste but not with this book. In this book Brenda weaves a wonderful tale of infidelity,suicide and seduction. This book answers the question why??? do people CHEAT. This is the first book that I have ever read where it really makes you feel sorry for the mistress and the adulterer. My only gripe with this book was that it was to short and didn't really have an ending. I am anticipating the sequel Fourplay.

Although after growing up I have learned most families are dysfunctional.There is not any such thing as a perfect family. Every family has different dynamics that you or I might not understand but to them it is normal. In this story you have twin sisters one who is fairly accomplished in life where the other one is a screw up. The &quot;bad&quot; does some terrible things to her sister her twin no less that I wouldn't do to an enemy. The mother of the twins well she is a whole different story altogether. I found her weird and eccentric at times. And at one point in this book I didn't like her at all for not protecting her children which led them to do unsafe things. This was a very simple easy fastpaced read.	2004-04-22

This was a beautiful message about a young girl who thought fast money was the way to go in the end she realized that she was wrong. This story wrings true all over the world in every city where there is poverty. Although most young girls never get the message. Most end up with STD'S or to many children by different fathers. If every teenage girl or young adult could read this book I believe it would make a difference in someone's life.<br />  This is why reading is so important not only for entertainment but to reach out and maybe touch or change someone's life. This book did not glorify the game but God turned this young girl's mind around as well as her mother. I am not saying Kashamba showed this message by throwing christianity at you. But she makes sure she gets her point across by using street lingo as well. If you are a TCP reader or if you are not pick this one up. The best TCP book I have ever read. Holla!!!!!!	2004-04-20

And when Curtis starting showing his natural behind Mariah should of just left him. Mariah had a great support system so there should have been no excuses. Although at times in this read I wanted to strangle Curtis myself it was still very comical how he got away with so many idiotic things.

This book covered many different real topics. Women and men in prison,poverty mixed with drug addiction,teenage pregnancy,child molestation and the list goes on. The fact that I grew up in the projects in NYC and then myself migrated to the city of Troy made this book even more riveting. I could definitely relate to many aspects of this book. But because I have always met someone who would give me a chance my life turned out nothing like that of Jessica's or Coco's or Serena's. I would like to also take time out to thank women like \\"Milagros\\" who has never given birth but who has taken in six children who were not her own and worked to raise these children. My hat is off to you. This family with all their extended offspring reflects many that are in every city. But unlike Coco who I am not knocking every time life throws me lemons I make lemonade. Why?????? Because I have long ago realized that life is to complex to ask Why????? And still I rise and after I have risen more lemons are rolled and sometimes thrown my way and guess what I still rise. I realize it is not easy for everyone to do this so what I am imploring is that all social service and governmental agencies read this book to understand every Random family and how one day when they are sitting in front of you how you can help them and not downgrade them. You could even be the lady in the bakery store ( Bella Napoli) smile at the little kid who only has twenty five cents for a cookie that costs one dollar and then find a sample cookie that they can afford. Because I am quite sure when that snooty lady comes in and wants a sample cookie she receives it. I also felt Rick Mason could have helped Coco to become a better  mother instead of making her feel alienated in a place that was supposed to be her own home. They have a community center at corliss park utilize this for parenting and budgeting classes. Their are  plenty of at home moms that are willing to volunteer their services to teach these young mothers how to become better women. You see KNOWLEDGE is the key to all of these problems without that no matter how hard any random family tries they will not succeed. Mercedes sat in that probation office begging for help their is no reason why she should slip between the cracks especially not in the city of troy where there are plenty of services that are unknown to destitute people. TO YOU Ms.LeBlanc A job well done. This family was very well researched and your portrayal of certain areas in this book were wonderfully written. You managed to keep your opinion out and just report. TEN STARS!!!!!!!! The best nonfiction that I have ever read. Thank you.

What more can I say,what a beautifully written book. If you are looking for a fast paced read that does not leave you when you are done reading it this is the book for you.Gloria once again has captivated me with her words this sister really can write Dayuuum,Dayuuum,Dayuuum like Florida Evans on Good Times would say. This sister held my attention page after page. I am really looking for the sequel. What a wonderful inspiration to families everywhere of how tragedy strikes and there were plenty of arguments but they still stuck together. I also loved the way Gloria incorporated the mother in law daughter in law concept into this story. Because many mother in law's don't realize that there daughter in law is a human with real feelings. Wow!!!!!! I will not tell you anything about the book because it will take away from your experience.This book is like an Eric Jerome Dickey book it keeps you wanting more and more.	2003-11-04

In this book there was nothing positive shown about our people.I think you are confused. All this book showed was that all black people can do is smoke marijuana,crack or drink and if they are not doing these things they or rather we as a people can not function. You see the difference between this author and Mr.Goines is that even in Mr. Goines books our people wanted better but saw no way out which was somewhat true in that era. But for this era to have a main charater who had a Miss Katie who was willing to help her as well as a guidance counselor this book could have taken a different turn. The main character had a problem with her mother's crack addiction but she then turned around and lit up a blunt like that was okay. The only reason I decided to check this book out was because of the the beautiful visual on the cover. But a Sister Souljah you are not.And you are definitely not touching Shannon Holmes. These are some of the authors you need to check out oh and let's not forget my girl Nikki Turner.	2003-10-21

Many of the reviews written for this book are not favorable. I thought the erotica in this book was well written why because it showed LOVE in these scenes. I did not get turned off and I am heterosexual. It's all about knowing and I mean knowing who you are anyway before I go off on a tangent my hat is off to you Mr.Dickey.

It was kind of sorta happy. But there were many unanswered questions. Like what's going through Scooter's mind. This book did explore issues that other authors are afraid to touch because they are afraid it might not sell. These issues were explored i.e. interracial children where do they fit in and also being a Gay Black man. In African American communities we are sometimes afraid of these issues and act as if they don't exist. This author also touched on bulimia which some African Americans would say never exists in their community but it does and why because some of us don't think that we are beautiful. But my sisters I'm here to tell you we are the most beautiful creatures that God has placed on this earth.	2003-09-23

I usually read two to three books a week.The story starts off slow then picks up and then takes another dive. The dives take a lot away from the story. At one point in this love story she has Darnell say to Shemone do you want my arm to fall off in reference to Billy Dee Williams. But then the writer states Billy Dee said this in Mahogany.WRONG,WRONG,WRONG. Billy Dee said that line in Lady Sings The Blues. Then she has a character who gets shot and is practically brain dead and she allows him to live which was not at all realistic with the story line. Although this is fiction reading is about making it realistic. And last but not least Shemone and Darnell get married and even though it was only close friends and family Darnell's best friend who was one of the main character's throughout the book was not even at the wedding.

Zane is by far one of the best authors I have read. She knows how to take a story and run with it. This book has serious drama in the name of illness,marriage problems and revenge. But through it all these sisters stick by each other as well as their friends. It reminded me of my friends that are close to me now and only a phone call away.	2003-05-07

All are page turners. This book is about dating and about some of the games that seem to go along with it. Vince meets and starts  dating  a nice woman but although he really is a good man he lies to her about having a child. When the mother comes back to town baby momma drama begins. This book is serious at times but has some comedy.	2003-05-07

It makes you forget where you are and what you are supposed to be doing. It was so good I had to hide in the bathroom at work to see what was going to happen next. Venice the main character is in love with two men. Two good men at that and she could not choose between them. The end is not predictable but leaves you wanting more. I think what makes this book so good is that this plot could really happen. If you want pick a book that will have you up all night or getting up early this is a great AA read for you. Darrien Lee is a new upcoming author. Support this sister as she refines her skills and gives us more.	2003-05-07
