However, the reality of law-making has been, and is likely to continue to be, that law-makers compromise. The compromises are often reflected in ambiguity or obscurantism that is intentional. Note the key word, \\"often.\\" So when it can be used, textualism is a good thing.    And one can argue (as I often do) that what we need is a return to a strict interpretation of the constitution. But, of course, that is neither a panacea nor a clear command. The founding fathers were themselves of diverse views as to how things ought to proceed. Consequently, there was compromise (do you suppose politics had been invented, way back then?). The predictable result is that all the research in the world will not lead to a single, unambiguous outcome for all matters.    Imagine the uproar if the SCt decides to go back to a strict interpretation of the Interstate Commerce Clause. The Drug Enforcement Administration will instantly be out of business because there is no plausible link between illicit drugs and interstate commerce. Or intrastate commerce, for that matter. But would Scalia vote to put the DEA out of business? He didn't last term, even though Thomas did.    And that leads to the major hidden flaw in this book. The reader is invited to assume Scalia has and will vote as he writes. He doesn't unless it fits with his own personal philosophy. The man has the intellectual honesty of a jackal, which is to say none whatsoever. My remark is, of course, based on having read most, but not all his opinions, and having a rather decent background in legal & constitutional scholarship.     Don't construe my low opinion for Scalia as a high opinion for the Warren court. Douglas was as intellectually dishonest as Scalia, and maybe a bit trickier. No, my preference is for judicial conservativism. John Paul Stevens is the purist of the last 50 years, perhaps longer. I have never read an opinion of his in which I could honestly say that logicand precedent could not reasonably lead to his conclusion. I may construe some of the precedents differently, but JPS has never in my reading made any outlandish interpretations of precedent. And, without exception, if you accept his interpretation, the logic of the law leads to his conclusion. That, Diogenes, is an honest man.	2005-10-01

Your expectations are key	I agree with the view that we have much more character development. At last. And I concur in the view that this is no longer the sweet, innocent tale of the first two or three books. No longer is it merely Dudders getting a bit of come-upance to Harry's delight. Things have got down and dirty.  <br /> <br />One of the reviewers finds the romance aspects to have no history. Yet that is not the way that I have read the series. Actually, I've been rather annoyed at what I saw as JKR's mal-portrayal of early-teen sexual/emotional fumblings. Harry was 11 or 12 until now, when he is 16 working on 17. The romance aspect seemed to me to fall into place as I had expected. <br /> <br />It is true, we see little of the entertaining, day-to-day life at Hogwarts. Still, how many more or better hexes or potions are there to hold the reader's interest? I suppose that is quite arguable on both sides. For a wizard, 17 equals adulthood (witches, too, I presume). Thus Harry needs to become an adult, even though JKR, along with all of us over-40s, realize that 17 year olds (or 18 or 25) still have a lot to learn, both intellectually and emotionally. Harry is not 17 going on 40. He's just a plain 17. Actually, he's not quite 17, given this book, like its predecessors, ends at the beginning of summer, before Harry's birthday. <br /> <br />Wrapping up Harry's war with Voldemort in the next book, which I presume is the plan, is going to have a note of unreality to it (within the universe in which Harry lives). Or it is going to cover more than one year. Harry still has lots to learn to be able to do all that he has set out to do. He doesn't seem to know all the counter-curses and counter-jinxes that the not-so-loyal opposition knows, and he certainly lacks the emotional discipline needed to see it through successfully. <br /> <br />Were it up for voting, I'd vote to send Harry off to Wizards college, maybe even grad school. Let him gain maturity and a wee bit of wisdom.  <br /> <br />Of all, I may have enjoyed this the most, or nearly so. That is a most remarkable feat for JKR. She has produced a series of books which, in contrast to most (the Dune series, for example), has not gone stale by the time we get to the third book. But, for me four and five were a bit off the cutting edge of one, two and six. <br /> <br />I suppose it will be another 18 or 24 months before we get to find out how Harry triumphs over Voldemort -- though surely it will not be in a permanent manner. After all, banishing evil from the world is a task unending. <br /> <br />I shall be sad to come to the end of the H.Potter series. I have enjoyed it immensely. But it will be interesting to see where JKR's imagination takes us next.  :-)	2005-07-25

No matter how wonderful you are -- and no matter how much BS the trainers give you about how they can sell any and every person -- you can't. The trick is to expect to generate 3 to 6 sales per 100 people you talk real estate to PROVIDED you keep in touch and don't expect anything for six months. Keep on keeping on, talk to 50 new people (while staying in touch with the old) for 18 months, and you will suddenly discover you are making a pile of money. On average, you will get 3 transactions a month every month, provided you keep talking to 50 new contacts per month. <br /> <br />What the motivational boys and the trainers don't tell you is they have nothing to teach. The only use for a trainer is to create a parent figure to whom you are responsible for making your phone calls, meeting the people and doing the follow up, and doing the follow up, and doing the follow up. <br /> <br />Darryl Davis is pretty far down the list when it comes to helping you get where you want to go.	2005-07-06

I had just finished bios of Washington and JQA when I undertook this, thank heavens. The \\"meandering\\" criticism is, I think, misplaced. The author is simply trying to ball up the strings of attitudes, attitudes which shifted as quickly as regional economic interests. <br /> <br />The reviewer who asserts the book is a lightening rod for one's own opinions has a point. The past few generations have grown up with the notion that the federal government is \\"She who must be obeyed\\" (with apologies to Rumpole). But it ain't necessarily so, were it not for the fact that the feds have the guns and tanks and, as Nixon and Bush 43 have demonstrated, the willingness to use them on our own people. (Don't get edgy about Bush43 -- absolutely not in the same league with Kent State. B43 has merely run roughshod over the civil rights of all Americans in the name of protecting me from terrorism). <br /> <br />It had been unimaginable to me that the states would ever consider they need not obey federal law. Nor did my American History classes cause me to realize that various state factions have seriously courted secession many times. Once again, \\"A little learning is a dangerous thing,\\" A. Pope. Are we about to swing back towards greater states' rights? I don't know. Certainly the current administration prefers an Imperial Presidency, but the SCt may, indeed, move towards a more balanced situation. <br /> <br />As the reviewers have implied, McDonald leaves one with the notion that the founding fathers had no consensus about how much power belonged where. I do not subscribe to the view that constitutional tensions were left present because our forebearers were prescient. Rather, their generation, like ours, had a wide diversity of viewpoints. As has happened many times with many laws, ambiguity has allowed for agreement, after which legislators could move on to something else. <br /> <br />There are no simple solutions, nor have there ever been. Politicians, from revolutionary to the current batch, pushing simplistic solutions have, when successful, succeeded in driving a wedge between regions. After reading this book, I am astonished that the US has not torn itself asunder. Little wonder the 18th century Brits did not expect the US to survive as a nation.	2005-02-13

My goodness, but the advice is inappropriate for Realtors, at least those on either coast.<br /><br />The \\"techniques\\" advocated were, and perhaps still are, used in selling paring knives, potato peelers and perhaps larger items like vacuum cleaners. Those techniques, if used more than very sparingly, tend to put off potential clients.<br /><br />The \\"How to List\\" routine is to knock on doors. This may have been a great approach in the 1950s when 95% (or more) of the houses were inhabited by stay-at-home moms, but now that a huge fraction of the homes (80% maybe??) are inhabited by two earner families, the cost/benefit ratio of walking your neighborhood is poor, to say the least.

It was, as Palmer underscores, the insane (by contemporary standards) infliction of huge reparations payments on Germany by England and France that brought about the next war, that sponsered by Adolf Hitler.<br />Similarly, &quot;Victory in 1918&quot; could be seen as a misnomer, for this book is little about the victory in 1918 and much about the antecedant years.<br />But it is only through the events recounted and the concomitant socio-political attitudes so well painted by Mr. Palmer that the outcome can be understood. I had had a good bit of difficulty understanding the attitude of appeasement which characterized the Chamberlin regime in England in the 1930's. The French attitude was even more opaque. The nature of the horror with which both countries, with which the electorates of both countries viewed the recent past was brought home vividly in this work. Similarly, Palmer's recounting of the secondary theaters of war, the so-called &quot;side-show,&quot; provides the link between the errors of the Treaty of Versailles and the 18th and 19th century European attitudes towards war and about the spoils of war going to the victors. Enlightening also were Palmer's depiction of the constantly shifting alliances of this war, and the acceptance of such motion, also left-overs from prior centuries.<br />In sharp contrast to WW II, Rommel's Panzer Corp and Patton's daring raids was the strategic and tactical vision, or lack thereof, of the French and British generals. Understanding the &quot;poilou's&quot; loss of faith in their leaders became easy. British lack of execution in Turkey, complained about by Churchill, resulted in failure, blamed on Churchill. Palmer fleshed this out in greater detail along with the amazing lack of decision-making capacity within the government. British military activities in Egypt and the mid-east were presented in thorough detail. The effects of 19th century colonialattitudes which carried into this war with deletrious effects for the Allies were fully portrayed.<br />Nor was the Western front given short shrift. Palmer presented a thorough, although not exhaustive, treatment. The futility of placing blame and the need for evolutionary thinking were made clear. The interaction between the Eastern and Western fronts, the changes that accompanied the Bolsheviks defeat by the Communists, and the general power elite fear of rebellion by the working class all are part of the calculus of the time. All are treated fairly by the author.<br />Mr. Palmer's prose is quite readable. At times it is a bit difficult to keep track of what's going on, but that was due, I think, to the complexities of shifting alliances and my perosnal unfamiliarity with the need for a continually updating scorecard. The level of detail was good. While not inflicting constant resource counts on us, Palmer provides enough depth both to hold one's interest and to allow one to understand what was happening.<br />An excellent book which shows, perhaps by accident, that the first three years of the war were a transition from the handsomely uniformed infantry, sabre-wielding calvary and horse-drawn ordinance and supply into the chemical warfare of the 20th century trench system. The final year was the transition from trench warfare to the mechanized, high speed war of Guderian. As Palmer shows us, more technological change occurred in these four years than had taken place in the previous 4,000. Against this well-portrayed tradition of the generals being a war behind, but the politicians being a century behind, Harry Truman's Marshall plan was a greater stroke of genius than even his most ardent supporters have realized.<br />Great book.	2000-11-13

I should also note that I'm not a greenie, although this work pushed me a step or two in that direction. I found Ms. Muir's book very entertaining. I read it while on vacation, in two sittings. One would correctly infer I also found it a bit disturbing. <br />Ms. Muir has interwoven fact with conjecture to create a probable eco-history of New England since the arrival of man. The conjecture is logically sound and has some evidentiary history. Early Americans, however, wrote no more history than early Africans or early Europeans; hence a degree of conjecture is necessary to flesh out game-theoretically sound propositions.<br />The begining thesis is that the forests of pre-human New England were ecologically sound. This is certainly a reasonable proposition which carries with it implications Ms. Muir details. From that point, Muir creates an eco-history showing how mankind, including the American Indian (or aboriginal American, if you prefer)has destroyed one of the largest air-sheds in the world. Muir discusses the way in which efforts to reforest the area have failed to duplicate natural ecology, and the implications of that failure. The implications have even more profound impact in the contempory Northwest, where I live and where deforestation is not complete, than in the Northeast.<br />Fortunately for the reader, Muir has written much more readably than I have here. She eschews jargon and labyrinthian technical explanations (in contrast with this sentence) to present a clear and convincing case. <br />I recommend this book wholeheartedly.	2000-11-12

I suppose this is a good book for would-be day-traders if and only if we knew that the market were about to enter another period like that of 1995-1999. I have the disadvantage of having been at this business since 1983. <br />The information presented about time-of-day is not universal across all market phases, other than it is true the first and last hour see the most volume and often the most volatility. <br />The concept that the highest volatility is the best time to trade is based in ignorance. The greatest volatility we have seen in the history of the US equity markets was 1987. Unless you were short (or flat) by the end of the day on Oct 16th, you were broke, dead broke, and you should have been short a couple of days before that. That just wasn't going to happen using these techniques.<br />The author's view of technical analysis is very narrow. What is pathetic is that he seems to believe he has great technical depth. It is also very dangerous for the reader.<br />Yes, I see all the other rave reviews. It will be interesting to see how well all like the techniques after a secular bear market, which will happen again. I'll be surprised if any of the raves are still trading, and, if the author continues to trade as described (which I suspect he is not even at this writing), I expect he will be broke. These methods are not new, and have not withstood the test of time.	2000-11-12

They have presented results using systems built around traditional technical indicators and their own &quot;standard exit&quot; method. These they use to show how to evaluate systems. This brief summary understates considerably the material presented on entries.<br />Differing entry techniques (limit, stop &amp; market)are examined in the context of each &quot;system.&quot; The reader is thus exposed to both the methodology of statistical evaluation and to &quot;how it feels&quot; to use this technique or that. <br />The authors actually start the book with an introduction to data types, availability and time frame; the bare-bones of needed statistical material; simulators (programs to simulate trading); and, optimizers and optimizing. I scanned the material, due to my own familiarity with it. It seems like good background. One point I've not seen elsewhere is the suggestion to optimize for high Student-t scores, an excellent idea.<br />Exits and exit techniques are dealt with, although less voluminously than entry techniques. One reason for that is the difference in amount written on the two. Everyone who wants to sell you a system, be it a book or a seminar, will emphasize entry technique. Very little has been written on exits, which are a more difficult sell. Katz &amp; McCormick have presented the basic categories of exits. While &quot;basic categories&quot; doesn't sound like much, it is more than I can recall appearing elsewhere in print. These categories are the building blocks for the second most important part of a system: exits. (More important is money management.) Here, as throughout the book, C+ code is included, allowing one to implement one's own approaches.<br />Another section, also with code, is use of genetic algorithms in system design. This is one of the best sections on GA's in trading that I've seen. It is not exhaustive (thank heavens) but will get you started without forcing a reading of Goldberg's text on GA's. Another departure from the norm is a short presentation of using GA's to optimize for the elements of the system, not for the actual output, a superior idea.<br />As the authors point out, exits are far more important than entry. A test system I wrote recently entered almost randomly after it had determined volatility was sufficiently high. Although not sophisticated, the exits were other than random. Although less than 20% accurate, it produced very substantial profits. Actual implementation is a bit trickier; real markets don't always provide the smooth entry and exit of systems testing. Be that as it may, the essential point remains: exit and money management are where the profits are. Entries are for seminar junkies and would be traders.<br />If trading is what you want to do, and computer-driven systems are what you will use, this is a book that you should read. It is the best I've seen (and I've seen a few). The other pieces to the trading puzzle are psychology (Ruth Roosevelt) and money management (Ralph Vince - not perfect, but a necessary read).	2000-11-12

This idea was first introduced by John Murphy. However, he did not, at that time,  present trading paradigms.<br />In my opinion, Ruggerio does not intend this  book to be a complete exposition on intermarket trading systems, much less  on &quot;cybernetic trading strategies.&quot; He does present enough  examples to show the way to develop your own, presumably more sophisticated  intermarket systems. Ruggerio really doesn't attempt to program and use  technical analysis, nor does he claim to. His discussion of neural nets and  genetic algorithms are very introductory. These are, however, topics that  require at least a book each, absent a very good background by the reader.  <br />In short, this is a pretty decent idea book, or rather approach book  dealing with computer driven trading systems which use intermarket  analysis. Personally, I think it's a useful book, even though I don't use  the approach: I'm more technically oriented.<br />If you are looking for a  definitive approach to using modern math to make a zillion dollars while  you watch basketball, this isn't the book. Of course, you won't find that  book, but that is a different discussion. Don't go here for neural nets or  genetic algorithms, either. See Goldman(?) for the latter. I'm no help for  the former.<br />I should note that this book is aimed at commodity traders.  Stock traders can make use of the techniques by translating &quot;commodity  name&quot; to &quot;sector name,&quot; assuming one uses sector analysis.	2000-05-25

The author has chosen a rather simplistic writing  style, and has elected to gloss over nearly all detail. <br />Not only is  detail about the presumptive main characters lacking, but also is detail on  the effects the actions of rulers, the main characters, have on the people  as a whole.<br />This book might have served as an outline for two or three  really good books. Unless buying for you seventh or eigth-grader, I suggest  looking elsewhere.	2000-04-18

This is not a book on trading systems or money management. It is a book to enable the trader to improve his/her trading. All of us suffer from emotional  blockages, many unconcious. It is the result of growing up in less than  perfect homes. RBR offers a step-by-step approach to finding and dealing  with the blockages the interefer with YOUR trading. Caps on  \\"your\\" because RBR uses a paradigmatic rather than case-specific  approach. Next best book so far is Tharp's \\"Trade Your Way to  Financial Freedom,\\" which, while good, is a distant second.     Of  course, if your computer finds the trades, places the orders and exits the  trades, and all you do is have the broker send you a check every month,  this book is of no value to you. I haven't become that clever yet.	2000-02-20

Mssrs. Sweeney have presented an idea book which focuses on what to look for, what to look out for, and, in passing, saves the cost of a piece of software.  What this book is not is a set of formulae showing how to make a million trading.  Thank Heavens! <br />The thrust of the book is to look at the phases a market can go through and to develop an approach for trading the phase now in evidence. Sweeneys also present concepts for turning a loss generated by a phase change into a profitable reversal.  This concept builds on the authors' other work, Maximum Adverse Excursion.  The concepts are fully explained and a methodology is used to illustrate each.  The authors are careful to note that the method used may not be what they use and may not be optimum, but rather is presented for illustrative purposes.<br />At the outset I thought this work appropriate for only intermediate and experienced traders.  Now I'm not so sure. Beginning traders, if they go back to this work from time to time, may be able to save themselves some time and grief.<br />I certainly recommend the book; I am uncertain whether I should post five stars or only four.<br />ron davis,CMT	1998-06-15

It's tough to say anything nice about an author who wrote a book 20 years ago with a false premise who has updated the book without revising the fundamental thrust.  The stock market, and other financial markets, are not random: they are chaotic.  The difference is significant and profitable. I know, both theoretically (schooled as a mathematician) and practically (trading successfully, as I do, is impossible in a negative sum game, which the market is, unless the market is chaotic rather than random).	1998-05-19

The first part is an exposition on an emotional problem that Dr. Elder had to deal with in order to become an effective trader.  This section is the strength of the book.  Successful traders who have been at the business for some time agree on one thing: sooner or later, a trader will face his or her own trading-related emotional crisis. The importance of the emotional aspects of trading cannot be overstated.  I have heard discussions in which the question was whether emotional aspects were merely the most important aspect or were the only important aspect to trading.  Dr. Elder's detailed description of how he found his way through provides guidance for readers whose psyches are similar to Dr. Elder's.  Unfortunately, Dr. Elder neglects the fact that his problem is not universal.  Other people have different backgrounds, grew up differently and have a different set of problems.  Thus understanding Dr. Elder's issues may not solve your problems or even point a useful direction. Given the Dr. Elder is a psychiatrist, I was expecting rather a full discussion of a range of issues and underlying causes which a trader might face. As you can tell, I was disappointed.  In the second section the author focuses on an assortment of trading tools.  The exposition is short, and he presents each tool as a stand-alone system without disclaimer or enlightenment.  Unfortunately, all the tools he presents as systems have been shown to fail as systems.  Dr. Elder does a great disservice to the reader by his failure here.  The final section is a very lightweight treatment of money management. Most traders will agree that money management, while less critical than managing one's self, is the next most important aspect of trading.  Dr. Elder's rules of thumb provide little guidance and no verification.  Game theory and statistical analysis make it possible to be precise about money management.  For a thorough treatment one should read one or more of Ralph Vince's works, also available through Amazon.	1998-03-22

Two years ago he went on record as predicting DJIA 800 in the next five years, and DJIA 1500 within two years.   The books to read by Prechter are his expositions on EWT, which are THE presentations of EWT.  Rather like Granville for so many years, Prechter seems bent on crying &quot;bear&quot; until one shows up. Unless you are fond of hearing yet another theory on &quot;Why the economy will collapse and trash the world's wealth,&quot; skip this presentation by Mr. Prechter.	1998-01-12
