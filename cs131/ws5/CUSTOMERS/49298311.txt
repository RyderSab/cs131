The 2nd novel in the Home Team series was another great, fast-paced adventure read. Like the first novel, Undeclared War, authors Dennis Chalker and Kevin Dockery give us another hardcore action read that drives ever forward like a fully-armed locomotive. <br /> <br />With realistic details and an all-too-real terrorist plot, Hostile Borders entertains you till the climatic, action-filled end. Ted Reaper is a hero of today's headlines. <br /> <br />I'm glad to have found such a fun and exciting new series. I can't wait for the next new novel coming out in February. <br /> <br />Hollywood, look no further for your new action major motion picture!!	2005-09-21

Although I have never heard of these two writers, I could almost tell right away by the sound of the synopsis on the back cover that this was going to be good. <br /> <br />And I wasn't disappointed. <br /> <br />And if you like fast-paced action/adventure reading, along with rich details, then you will enjoy this also. <br /> <br />This would make for a great Hollywood film. But knowing them, they would most likely botch it up. Unless a great director was attached to it, like Tony Scott, Randall Wallace, or Steven Speilberg, just to name a few. <br /> <br />As to the book? The writers seem to know what they are talking about. One being an ex-Navy SEAL. Gritty and cool, The Home Team Undeclared War novel is chock full of revenge driven men, getting together to help out a friend, who's family has been taken hostage by a band of terrorists. <br /> <br />Even though I do like detail, sometimes this came across a bit too much, slowing down the pace. But if you are looking for an above average military type revenge story, then this one is for you. <br /> <br />I look forward to reading the next in the series - Hostile Borders. As well as the other books written by these solid seeming authors.	2005-09-13

After the awesome last Deathlands novel - Vengeance Trail - written by the illustrious author, Victor MIlan, this follow-up novel was pretty terrible.    Written by the worst of the 5 authors for this series, Andy Boot, this novel starts off actually pretty decent here. (That's the only reason I gave it 2 stars!) But then very quickly turns into a quagmire of stupidity in storytelling.    If Andy Boot would learn from the likes of the original writer, Laurence James, along with Nick Polatta and Alan Philipson and Victor Milan, he could probably team up with the 2nd worse writer of the team - Edo Van Belkom - and perhaps come up with a fun, exciting, and solid read.    But as is, Andy Boot continues to only show small signs of promise in this series. The things he did pretty well were showing a new case of Doc Tanner's madness. Not the 'turning into someone else persona' crap - but the inner workings of his maddened state. Also the questions that Ryan Cawdor asks himself in the beginning. This needed to be asked for awhile now.    But then, in typical Andy Boot fashion, he drops it and does nothing with it.     And in another typical Andy Boot fashion, he writes the companions off as being some type of idiotic first-time survivalists, going out into the unknown tundra for no apparent reason. (Except that the author can't come up with another viable explanation to do so!)    Why in every Andy Boot storyline must the companions leave a comfy and safe redoubt for inhospitable deserts and frozen tundras?! He doesn't even bother to write in an explanation as to what gear they took from the redoubt! What, just new coats? No name brands or gloves or head gear? And as the story progresses, they just produce flashlights out of their butts!    Why not clearly establish the items taken from the redoubt before they venture out into the frozen unknown - at the very least?!     And then the novel quickly gathers negative momentum from there. From freezing and starvation, to killing a few big bears. Then leaving them without making food and clothing out of them. This author clearly demonstrates that he has no clue to survival or combat acumen.     And just because the companions land in a redoubt full of bad memories, this isn't nearly quite enough for them to make stupid mistakes that would kill them all. And they continue doing it!! Insepid and stupid trash. Clearly the author does not favor the leader, Ryan Cawdor. Nor does he take into account that his readers are above elementary reading and understanding status.    [...] I wouldn't have even purchased this one. They say that Nick Polatta wrote this one, along with the 2nd part coming out in 3 months. I wish it was he!!    C'mon, Andy Boot, when are you going to learn? Just because Gold Eagle finds it somehow in their editing hearts to publish you, does that mean you have to continue giving us crap? How can anyone, after reading fun and exciting and well written stories such as Vengeance Trail, find this appealing?    Again, Andy Boot needs to get the boot.	2005-09-06

Where the 1st Menagerie novel - The Nimble Man - started, this 2nd one carried on to give me a fine and most enjoyable and exciting read. <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong, it had a few bumps along the way, about midway. Where this novel started out pretty good and interesting, it all the sudden took a nose dive about a 1/3 of the way in, and I almost put it down without finishing it. A few times. <br /> <br />But then, all of the sudden, the monotony that the 1st reviewer mentioned wore off, and it was like one of the writers - most likely Christopher Golden - took over and gave it that extra and much needed UMPH! (Sorry, Mr. Sniegoski if I am wrong.) <br /> <br />The last half of the book is filled with Olypian-sized action/adventure, with very creative settings and action-filled scenes that never let up. I liked the twist and turns of this novel, too. There were some cool surprises mixed in with all the bloody mayhem. The creatures of Olympus here were written very well, giving it a much needed overhaul that fit this dark fantasy a living, breathing world, (or Underworld, I should say!), that breathed new life into magnificent old myths and legends.  <br /> <br />I enjoyed it immensely. And you should, too. Just read through the ho-hum parts, and the real meat and potatoes of the story unfold like a runaway locomotive. Truly exciting.	2005-09-02

Unlike most sequels, this one was almost just as good as its predecessor. <br /> <br />City of the Dead is a non-stop roller-coaster action thrll ride that will take readers into a zombie-filled world the likes of no movie ever came close to. This storyline was much like this summer's lackluster film of George Romero's Land of the Dead. <br /> <br />If Romero would've made his film half this good, it would have been a major blockbuster, smash hit. Instead, it was a little above average zombie movie. The remake of Dawn of the Dead is by far the most superior zombie movie ever made. And it was much more like this awesome writer's books. <br /> <br />Brian Keene's zombies are intelligent, not the slow-moving dummies that the same 'ol filmakers portray them to be. Oh, no. That's what makes these two novels stand alone, all unto themselves. As well as rich characters of differing varieties.  <br /> <br />City of the Dead was never dull, and packed enough horror, action and adventure to keep you up to all hours of the night. Just hope that it doesn't follow you to your dreams. <br /> <br />It is just that good.	2005-08-27

Though I don't normally read lots of horror, especially zombie-type books - this one was clearly over-the-edge in this genre. <br /> <br />I recently watched the new remake of Dawn of the Dead, and thought it way better than any zombie movie ever made. Character-driven and well directed, with a new kind of scarier zombie.  <br /> <br />And this summer's kinda lackluster comeback of the supposedly great director George Romero with his Land of the Dead movie - which was alright, though not awesomely great - made me just realize how epic this one, single novel of Mr. Keene's is. <br /> <br />The Rising reminded me strongly of Robert R. MCcammon's apocalyptic epic novel - Swan Song. Much more than a zombie book, The Risng has excellent characters and a much broader idea behind it all. There is never a dull moment in this novel, from beginning to end, there is non-stop explosive action. <br /> <br />The ending would have driven me crazy if the sequel wasn't already out. It literally left me on the edge of my seat. I would've been pissed if I had to wait until a sequel were made, just to see what happened. <br /> <br />But luckily, I got introduced to this awesome writer's work late, but not too late to have the sequel to The rising in my grubby little hands right now. The City of the Dead starts right off where The Rising ended. Thank God! <br /> <br />If Hollywood would open their eyes, they would see that Brian Keene's novel The Rising, MUST BE the next zombie movie to be made. Not only would it raise the bar in this genre so much higher, but it would be a roller-coaster classic in every sense of the word.  <br /> <br />I hope the much better director, Mr. Snyder, who directed the remake of Dawn of the Dead, than Mr. Romero, would be picked to direct this novel-turned-into-a-movie.  <br /> <br />A must read for anyone who loves a well-written novel.	2005-08-23

Don't get me wrong, it is not bad. It had its merits. But all the over usage of hide and seek tactics got old for me after awhile.  <br /> <br />The main character is pretty engaging, however. The reviewers would have one think that this novel was going to read like a Quentin Tarantino film. But it didn't...at all.  <br /> <br />But it was good enough to where I'll probably check out the 2nd novel, just to see if the writer was just getting warmed up.	2005-08-16

I hope all this build-up towards Jagang's mano-a-mano is much more exciting than this. <br /> <br />Not nearly as good as his Pillars of Creation, Naked Empire's tediousness was still readable because of Zedd's storyline and solid and exciting plight. That actually saved the day here, for me. <br /> <br />I certainly hope the next novel is much more exciting to read.	2005-08-10
US	49298311	R1VKCY2QOMHA4C	0373638477	386314891	Successors (Outlanders)	Books	5	0	1	N	N	Milan's Successors is a great success!!	Simply put - Bloody awesome!  <br /> <br />Victor Milan's latest Outlanders novel - like his latest Deathlands: Vengeance Trail novel - plainly cements the fact that he is more than able to write for both series.  <br />He firmly establishes himself - moreso than ever - that he belongs in this Axlerverse.  <br /> <br />Being ex-military myself, and being a fan of Milan's for years since his Guardian series days, penning as writer Richard Austin, it was pretty easy to come to like the Team Phoenix guys.  <br /> <br />I think what he brought to the board was an up-to-date four-man Guardian team, resplendent with boy toys up the wazoo! They bring to the world of the Outlanders a breath of fresh air, since they are castaways in time. I like that aspect of them. They quote today's movie lines, and miss what the old world had to offer, including family. That gives them a richer character. And Milan does it with bloody aplomb!  <br /> <br />In his latest and greatest adventure since Awakenings, Victor Milan's Successors gives proper homage to Ellis's world and main characters. I loved reading about how Team Phoenix and the Cerberus Group are now working together in saving the world. Both were written in very well with Milan's deft skills.  <br /> <br />The reason I didn't give it a 10 rating is because - like Mark Ellis's latest work - Kane and Brigid still haven't made any new steps towards each other. And Shizuka seems to be gone all too much all of the sudden. Both writers seem to have cast her out of the world-changing-and-saving business. I don't get that.  <br /> <br />But with that aside, Successors reads like what I hope the soon-to-be-released movie of DOOM, starring The Rock, will hopefully be like. Fun and likeable characters, armed to the gills, battling muties and creatures of various kinds. Never a dull moment here.  <br /> <br />I liked how Kane exiled himself for awhile. Mark Ellis has written that he has done this on occassion, visiting the local Amerindians of Skydog. So, why not take a break from the close confines of Cerberus and the world - Milan style!  <br /> <br />He didn't make a big deal out of it, and neither will I. All it did was create a wonderul, creative, and exciting scene of showing the reader just how progressive Milan can be as a writer for this series. I was taken totally by surprise that a new hunter-killer team was out there - and hunting Kane! So, Team Phoenix is not the only freezie military team out there, eh? Very ingenious and utterly interesting...  <br /> <br />The plague of mutie demons in this novel are evil, vicious, and cool as hell to read about. I won't ruin it for the potential readers out there, but there is one scene where Kane, Grant and Brigid confront a small girl in the catacombs of a weird redoubt. It is hard to gross me out or give me the shivers, but this whole scene was creepy. Excellent, Mr. Milan.  <br /> <br />Readers can expect tons of action and adventure in this one. With Team Phoenix lending a helping hand in a two-pronged battle plan to save the world from Gilgamesh Bate's smart, but evil mind. Actually, the muties are an invention by a woman named Ishtar. An insane whitecoat that read like she was really a whacked-out Domi on crack. Devilishly fun to read about.  <br /> <br />Milan leaves a wide opening in this novel, showing it plainly, like in Deathlands, that he is far from over playing in these two writing arenas called the Axlerverse. Team Phoenix deserves their own series. I very much look forward to Victor Milan's next set of novels. An awesome and exciting sci-fi-action/adventure writer of the highest caliber.  <br /> <br />Thanks for the thrill ride summer read, Milan!  <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />	2005-08-05

John Harriman's newest novel, Prelude to War, tells the story of a Delta Force mission just before the US war starts in Iraq. <br /> <br />Now being led by Captain Poole - a character from the 1st book - the small DF team infiltrates and captures Saddam Hussein's sons, Uday and Qusay. And then a race ensues, for the DF team to get out of Iraq with the sons of Hussein, before Hussein's army and specialized soldiers called the Desert Wolves finds them. <br /> <br />Then comes Robert Night Runner. <br /> <br />The Amerindian Marine from Force Recon. The only stand-out of the team from the first novel - Operation Michael's sword.  <br /> <br />Spangler is brought out of retirement in the beginning of the novel, (Which is one that is both gross, memorable, and laugh out loud funny at times!), and teams up with an unusual couple to work together for a secret mission inside Iraq. <br /> <br />As the Delta Force team gets trapped inside Iraq, Spangler goes out and recruits the unusual assortment of heroes: Baker, the man in the last novel who was the only one able to infiltrate the Al Queda organization, and getting close to Osama Bin Laden. Who now has only one hand to fight with, having lost the other in the 1st novel. <br /> <br />And our illustrious and best character of them all - SGT Robert Night Runner. The change in him from the last novel will surprise many readers. I won't ruin it. But suffice it to say - it will entertain you on several levels. <br /> <br />The last 1/3 of the novel is the best part. As Baker and Night Runner enter Iraq, the awesome action and adventure never let up. Nor do the many surprises in store for the reader. <br /> <br />The ending left me both breathless - and wanting to read the next installment right away - just to find a certain answer. <br /> <br />Rober Night Runner's vision, along with his reawakening in the desert of Iraq, is one that will surely entertain you, and stay with you. for some time to come. <br /> <br />A must read.	2005-07-24

Coleman's Legends of Kern trilogy was good, but not as great as it should have been. <br /> <br />Even though this is in the age of Conan, it more feels like reading about warring tribes of Stone Age men. Just with a sprinkle of fantasy thrown in it. <br /> <br />And that's not a bad thing. This book, more so than the first, remined me strongly of William Sarabande's First American series. One of my favorites.  <br /> <br />The weakness of this book is the same old warring factions. After a while, I really wanted new locales and new things to happen. And it did...somewhat. It got more interesting when Kern and Daol ran into the Galla spider people. And also when Kern starts recieving his Yirmish Call.  <br /> <br />There are some good fighting sequences, but more dull ones in this one. The writing itself seems a bit more odd and hard to fathom and/or follow at times. <br /> <br />I'm not one to ruin the plot, so suffice it to say - read it just to find out where this goes, if you enjoyed the 1st one like me. But don't expect too much in this one. Pretty much same ol', same 'ol. <br /> <br />I just purchased the last and third installment. I hope for bigger and better things in Songs of Victory.	2005-07-18

I really always think that John Ringo's ideas and concepts are good ones, and always after reading one, wonder how in the world so many people like this author. <br /> <br />I honestly don't get it. I started with his supposed biggest hit series - A Hymn Before Battle - and thought it adequate, at best. It certainly didn't leave me wanting more. <br /> <br />Then I tried the 1st volume of his and David Weber's collaboration - with awesome covers by the way - even though I don't even recall the book's title.  <br /> <br />Again, like his others, I ilke the concepts, but the story was overburdened with too much political garbage. Not enough action and adventure for my tastes. The characters didn't even seem more than one-dimensional. <br /> <br />And now, with his latest - another great concept idea for a series - especially with the big-budget movie - War of the Worlds out there now - left me high and dry in a lot of ways. <br />The characters' reactions as loads of scary alien beings pouring through a gate was to...yawn? And how was this supposed to excite the reader? <br /> <br />Needless to say, I live exactly where this story takes place. And that drew me in more closely than others. The ideas, though not wholly original, are still one's that I like to read about. <br /> <br />If they are written well! <br /> <br />So, please tell me, how is a reader supposed to love novels that only have great ideas, but whose characters are bored themselve, and are one-dimensional?  <br /> <br />Man, if this is what makes an author get on the Bestseller list, then I can't wait to finish and get my manuscript in somewhere. If this is any indication of an awesome author, then my Trilogy should come off as epic as I hope it to be. <br /> <br />Sorry Mr. Ringo. I respect you. And I really wished I liked your novels. But your execution of them leaves me saying - 'Ehhh?\\"	2005-07-10

After being introduced to the reading world of the vampires - starting with the awesome Brian Lumley's The Necroscope series, I was needing another vampire reading fix. Then I found and read all of Christopher Golden's vampire series - The Shadow Saga. Both are hugely entertaining, and both approach the vampire myths differently.  <br /> <br />Then a couple of years ago, I spot Minion. I liked the cover and the title, but it alluded to a romance-type storyline. So I pass it up. <br /> <br />Now, after reading a few of the reviews, along with reading the back covers of the newer four novels, my interest piqued again. So, I gave it a try. <br /> <br />Overall, Leslie Banks gives a strong street-wise and smarts approach to the vampire legend. I see a lot of reviewers didn't like this. Then they totally missed the point of the character's backgrounds. Especially the main character, Damali Richards and her estranged lover-turned-master vampire, Carlos Riviera. <br /> <br />The stengths of this 1st novel is the fresh approach, along with some strong, interesting, and differing characters. I didn't like the lack of the vampire hunter's character decriptions, nor of their clothing and/or weaponry. The first fighting sequence wasn't very well done, neither. I couldn't 'see' our characters, nor their type of clothing and weaponry clearly. Leslie Banks leaves a little too much for the imagination there. <br /> <br />But the novel never bored me, and that's saying something for a over 40-year-old reader of just about every genre. It left me wanting more, and hooked into the next novel...and probably into reading the entire series. <br /> <br />Thus, she did her job.  <br /> <br />I loved Carlos's plight, and what the ending foreshadows for the future of the series. Though not as epic as The Necroscope series, and not as action and larger-than-life as the Shadow Saga, This 1st installment of the Vampire Huntress Legend novels leaves one entertained enough for a second go-around.I don't like Buffy, but loved the Blade movies. And, thank God, this novel trends more towards the latter - Blade. Far superior to the adult audience. <br /> <br />Thanks for a solid debut read, L. A. Banks!  <br /> <br />You have another fan.	2005-07-07

I took some time off of reading Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series. I wasn't too crazy about the last two I read before this one. <br /> <br />It is not that they were bad, just I'm not too crazy about a series steering clear of its main core characters and plotline. Terry Goodkind is without a doubt an extremely talented writer. The first three Sword of Truth books were the best - so far. <br /> <br />So, after taking a few years away from Goodkind's novels, I finally picked up Pillars of Creation - and liked it immensely! <br /> <br />Now that I'm looking forward to reading the lastest two, most reviewer's didn't like them, it seems. But I already picked up Naked Empire, and will eventually read it, and come up with my own decision on whether it is good or not. <br /> <br />Pillars of Creation, however, clicked with me. Whether it was because I took a break from it, or just was captivated with the Rahl twins, it was never dull or boring to me. Chock full of interesting characters - as always - Goodkind delivers the goods on giving the reader a fun and exciting tale of sword and sorcery.  <br /> <br />I fully recommend it.	2005-06-12

Not in a long time have i read the Deathlands being this well drawn in a long, long, time.  <br /> <br />And what is even more wonderful, is the fact that the bad guys are plentiful enough for several books all rolled into one. And even they are far from cookie cut-outs. Well fleshed-out with very interesting and intriguing characterizations all of their own.  <br /> <br />The muties are bloody awesome as well. Plentiful and wonderfully written. With fresh new ones introduced that will leave an impression on the readers.  <br /> <br />This is a writer who obviously listens to his reading audience. Well, insofar as DL goes.  <br />Not only does he stay true to Laurence Jame's versions of the past Deathlands companions, but he furthers it to show their loyalty and love for one another. Something that has been ignored for far too long.  <br /> <br />I loved the way in which Milan shows how the surviving companions show their differing kinds of grief over Ryan's supposed death. It was wonderful and refreshing, to say the least.  <br /> <br />Especially when it came to Jak and Krysty.  <br /> <br />Some new hints of new storylines and characters are shown in this novel, and I hope they are further explored in future editions of this series.  <br />What is so wonderful about this latest DL novel is the fact that Milan pays attention to detail. He utilizes and brings out the sheer beauty and danger that the Deathlands has to offer.  <br /> <br />Something most writers seem to ignore. From acid rain to mutie plants and animals, to how to survive in the hottest hot spots.  <br />Another thing that is usually ignored by other writers.  <br /> <br />I also loved the new group introduced here called the Tech-Nomads. They were cool and very interesting.  <br /> <br />I'm not the kind of reviewer that will give key points away in any novel, but suffice it to say, this one will most definately please the masses.  <br />And not even the 'Outlanders Only Club' can deny that this one was extremely well written in a number of ways.  <br /> <br />Way to go, Victor!  <br /> <br />Thanks for cementing the fact that you are tailored made for this thing we call - the Axlerverse.  <br /> <br />I for one cannot wait for your next Outlander novel. But the way he writes Deathlands is by far superior. Please, keep 'em comin' Mr. Milan!  <br /> <br />	2005-06-11

Mark Ellis, aka, James Axler in this series, writes another tour de force novel here. Not only does this latest installment mark major shifts and changes to the series, but lends some long-held mysteries to be finally revealed. <br /> <br />The new order and rulers - along with the world-changing and climatic events - seems like the new turning point to this series outta be very interesting to read about. <br /> <br />The only downside to this otherwise awesome and exciting read was the lack of detail to a couple of battle scenes. Well, not really detail in the action sequence itself, but the lack of participation on the newly-reborn Serpent Kings themselves. There were nine 7-foot-plus tall creatures with supposedly superior strength and powers, along with their small army of armored warriors called Nephilim, with their plasma-shooting gauntlets and impervious armor. <br /> <br />All this against an ill-equipped threesome of our reluctant heroes, who had a terrible battle plan to begin with! It was exciting to read, but total BS in the believability factor. Something that Mark Ellis is usually aware of.  <br /> <br />So, because of battle scenes where a much larger, more powerful group seem to idly sit by while their puny humans do damage and kill their inhuman army, along with editing problems permeating throughout the book, as well as wondering why our supposedly smart heroes find a weakness in armored warriors and don't take advantage of it - Children of the Serpent still manages to stay head and shoulders above most mainstream sci-fi/action books out there today.  <br /> <br />If there is better out there, please e-mail me and let me know.  <br /> <br />Looking forward to what the next installment of Outlanders will bring.	2005-05-11

This new book series - # 1: Delta Force: Operation Michael's Sword - is awesome to say the least. <br /> <br />I was pleasantly surprised to find that one of my all-time favorite characters, Sgt. Robert Night Runner, from the excellent 6-book series of Force Recon, was in this novel.  <br /> <br />This automatically told me that author James V. Smith, jr, of the fabulous Force Recon series is now writing this new series, under the alias of John Harriman.  <br /> <br />And as much as I liked Force Recon, I have to say that this author brilliantly changed course slightly here - and for the better! - writing the finest and largest case scenario novel to date about the tragic 911 date.  <br /> <br />This novel will instantly grab you, and shock you physically and mentally, leaving you gasping for more. Here, love and war are looked at, and not always in a pretty light. <br /> <br />That was the greatness of it. <br /> <br />If only Hollywood would make movies like this! <br /> <br />Simply put, this new book is much more than it appears. I am just so glad that this highly intelligent author chose to listen to his reading audience fans of force recon, and found a way to keep his older characters from his other series in this new one. <br /> <br />Even though Night Runner is not the main focal point, nor lead character, he still manages to steal each scene he is in. I am very much looking forward to Book # 2 in this magnificent new series. <br /> <br />For you people who liked this - you really need to get your mittens on the Force Recon novels, written under this author's other seudonym, James V. Smith, jr.  <br /> <br />A must read.	2005-03-15
US	49298311	R1WKBQIFAPO0I	0373625790	583833563	Black Harvest (Deathlands)	Books	3	8	9	N	N	This one didn't reap the full harvest	In this latest edition of Deathlands, Edo Van Belkom returns for his 2nd foray into the series.  <br /> <br />In short, it was a little better than his first try, Skydark Spawn, but Edo needs to ante up and step up to the proverbial plate - big time!  <br /> <br />Though not as lame as Andy Boot's tales, Black Harvest actually had some good ideas, along with a well overdone formula storyline, that was at least readable enough to finish.  <br /> <br />Essentially, this is a standard fare Deathlands of old, though a very slight trend upwards from Boot's last one, but not as good as the last issue, SHAKING EARTH.  <br /> <br />The good points to this latest DL? They are few, unfortunately.  <br /> <br />1: Jak gets wounded, and gets hooked on a strong drug.  <br /> <br />2: Doc falls in love.  <br /> <br />3: Characters are not too bastardsized.  <br /> <br />4: The black market of DL drugs, (which hasn't ever been done to this level), made for a decent background story here.  <br /> <br />The bad points? Wow, where to start.  <br /> <br />1: Lame as hell muties. Edo, you really need to brush up on what constitutes a mutie here! A group of people with simple sores doth not make a mutie. Good God in heaven, that was it!?  <br /> <br />Weak man, just bloody weak. You mean to tell me that in this day and age of so many talented writers, that this one couldn't simply come up with a colorful new mutie? Hell, even using a tried and true one that Laurence James created would've been better than this lame excuse of one!  <br /> <br />That, in itself, could have made this story a bit better. But alas, it wasn't to be...  <br /> <br />2: No colorful post-holocaust scene setting and/or weather patterns here?! Why has this been seemingly utterly forgotten by the new writers? Nick Polatta did a good job of at least utilizing this back in BLOODFIRE. And it set a solid good old standard much needed here.  <br /> <br />Where's the freezing cold or the nuke-blasted heat? Or ever-changing weird weather patterns to set an interesting stage? Not once did Edo write in whether this mid-west area was either. It was simply there. DING, DING! Wake up writers! Laurence James was awesome at scene setting in this DL world. Lordy, I miss that guy. He could paint you a bleak as hell picture, actually taking the reader right there. And also paint a beautiful picture when the group ran across them.  <br /> <br />3: Way too many 'easy ways out' here. From firefights to reloading ammo, there were way too many timing problems here that were easily taken care of. One is more than enough in any given story. But here there were too many permeating this single story.  <br /> <br />C'mon, GE! Grow a set, and let these writers - or someone! - get somewhat back to some tried and true formulas that worked in the past, which made this series great and quite unique.  <br /> <br />And that's letting some of the older characters to either die and/or move on. Gain some new blood, for crying out loud! Laurence kept it fresh for a while doing that.  <br />And also gain some new weaponry! Why must they keep the same old crap? What, for continuity sake? Oh, please!! That has already gone out the window.  <br /> <br />I truly hope that in the near future, these group of writers, (namely I'm talking to Andy Boot and Edo here!), seriously consider the bold new avenue that Mr. Alan Philipson has tried taking this series. With both SHADOW WORLD and BREAKTHROUGH, he has taken the DL to some new heights. I love this kinda new breath of fresh air adventure writing.  <br /> <br />C'mon, don't be such fools. Take more risks. Take us readers to new heights in action/adventure reading by utilizing everything that Jack Adrian and Laurence James started, and at times, only touched upon!  <br /> <br />Such as time trawling or chron jumping. Why not build a kick-ass story on those cool ideas? That's almost totally unused new and dark territory writers! Take it and run with it.  <br /> <br />In short, Black Harvest is nothing really new. If you like a quick and breezy action/adventure read, I suppose it is passable. But some of the action was laughable. But it is Ok.  <br /> <br />At least I didn't throw it in the trash or send it back to GE, like I've done in the past starting with SALVATION ROAD.  <br /> <br />In all truth, it is really a rad-blasted shame that these two writers are taking this great series that started this sci-fi/fantasy type phenomenal universe - and are trying to turn it completely to weak, utter trash.  <br /> <br />C'mon, you guys! You writers are geting paid here. And we hard-liners are slamming you two. Step it up a few notches, will you? I know you can...if you just try a tad bit harder.	2005-03-11
US	49298311	R2PQEVTRFKVKFO	0373638450	288219814	Evil Abyss (Outlanders)	Books	4	1	1	N	N	The Anghor Wat Adventure!	Mark Ellis's latest Outlander's installment was an excellent adventure read.  <br />Chock-full of his usual scientific and fantasy-like aspects of strange Earth energies, EVIL ABYSS was a fun and exciting read.  <br />However, it was also chock-full of missing words. Editors are falling asleep at the wheel in editing these works. Last issue, Victor Milan's sentences were overlong and awkward. This issue, Ellis's work was just plum missing simple words. Weird and distracting.  <br />The artwork of these novels - though excellent - miss the marked chracteristics of the characters.  <br />Why is Grant bald, and without his gunfighter's mustache? Why is Kane looking different in every book cover art? Where is his wolf-like build and facial scar? He looks like a clean-shaved and nicely har-cutted college student.  <br />Such excellent artwork, but missing such vital details. Is no one awake out there in Gold eagle Publishing Land?? What a shame.  <br />The story of Evil Abyss - the main plot leastways - takes almost half the book to get to. There was a tad bit of backwash backstory starting to resurfece again, but not as badly as it has been in the not too distant past.  <br />Not as good as Mask of the Sphinx, Ellis still manages to balance writing a solid action/adventure story, along with rich characterization.  <br />I like the fact that he is delving into Kane's and Brigid's feelings towards one another, but it still seems way too long and drawn out in this type of world scenario.  <br />I also liked the fact that Kane goes off on the Cambodian adventure alone, giving the reader more time with him, instead of having to balance Grant, Domi, and Lakesh into the mix. Nice change. I wish Deathlands writers would do more of the same with Ryan Cawdor.  <br />The story for me really took off as kane crash-lands in Cambodia, fighting off giant mutie monitor lizards and meeting up with his fate and/or destiny once again, unbeknownst to him, of course.  <br />As usual, Ellis's scientific principles sound interesting and well researched, but I could never explain them, nor pretend to totally understand them myself. But they lend a realism to the fantasy, sci-fi aspects of the story. He's always been good at that.  <br />This was kind of a strange journey for me, as well as kane and company, but still a solid read, nonetheless. Well worth the time to read.  <br />I'm really looking forward to the next installment that is suposedly marking a major change in the series.  <br />Again, excellent artwork and coloring on the cover, but characteristics all wrong. Drives me crazy. <br /> <br />  <br />  <br />	2005-02-11

Greg Cox writes another excellent underwold installment.  Cox ties all the strings of storyline together nicely here, thus explaining even more just what the first novel pertained to, and movie didn't quite clearly explain, in terms of background info. <br />Sure, this is more the lycan Lucian's story, with a tie-in to Selena in the beginning and end, but still this was so entertaining I didn't care after awhile.   <br />Lucian's and Sonja's love story is well told here.  Greg Cox shows us the very beginnings of this Lycan/vampire break-up in the midieval times setting, which was also wonderfully written.  I loved the back and forth romp through time, from present day to distant past, showing the lycans and vampires in their sword and sorcery type setting.   <br />I hope the next movie follows this same type of storyline.	2004-12-29

Sandstorm not only had awesome characters, plot, and exotic locales, but even an interesting three way love story that's not sappy. <br /> <br />Where Ice Hunt was better than it's predesessor, Sandstorm pretty much does the same here.  But just barely.  I instantly got into the new character, Painter Crowe.  But there were quite a few great characters in this novel, both good and evil. <br /> <br />Whoever reviews these novels and comments that Rollins has weak and/or one-dimensional characterizations in his novels, surely must have their head stuck in the sand!  Yes, pun intended. <br /> <br />Whether writing as James Rollins or James Clemens, jim's written characters breath out life within each and every page of his novels.  His characters are anything BUT one-dimensional.  I saw changes within certain characters as the novel progresses, keeping me that much more interested and turning pages into the wee hours of the night. <br /> <br />If you haven't yet tried this extremely talented writer, then you MUST run, not walk, to the nearest bookstore or library nearest you.   <br /> <br />If you liked such movies as The Mummy and The Mummy Returns, then SANDSTORM, (which is so much better than both of these movies), will sweep you up in a high stakes adventure and blow you away with it's Michael Crighton-type high-tech and mythologically exciting read.	2004-08-05

As is the 1st Rigante novel.  That, to me, was his best thus far that I have read. <br /> <br />Druss is not a complicated enough character, though I did like him.  And the problem I had with his true love, Rowena, was that she made absolutely no attempts at getting away from her captors.  All the while, poor Druss is doing everything he can to get her back. <br /> <br />With her not only not trying, what does she do?  She falls in love with another man!  Thanks alot lady!

The 1st novel of The Rigante thus far, is by far the best novel written that I've tried from this author.<br />Years ago I tried the Drenai saga, The stones of power series, The adventures of Waylander, The Jerusalem Man series, and could not get into them.  But I liked Legend.  Who didn't, it seems?<br />So I will definately be getting more in this series, as well as Druss novels.  This was a fun and fast-paced heroic fantasy novel, chock-full of interesting characters and action.  A must read.	2004-07-01

I started with Legend when it first came out and truly liked it alot.<BR>So, of course I would grab the next few books that I could find.  But surprisingly to me, I could not get into any of them, so I gave up thinking Legend was a fluke.<br />But I still followed and looked at each book that came out successively, but without trying them.  Now, years later, I decided to try out one of his singular, non-series type books.<br />And was pleasantly surprised.  I pretty much instantly got into Echoes without growing bored.  Quite the contrary!  Though some of the battles were somewhat boring and stiff, the characters and overall originality of the storyline kept me hooked.<br />Now, I'm over halfway thru with the 1st Rigante novel, and already I think it even far superior than Echoes of a Great Song.  I suppose I'm a fan once agiain...for now.	2004-06-29

And they are pretty cool too.<br />Fast-paced action and adventure, along with god-like battles with monsters in the guise of humans, thrown with some passionate sex, and you have one whale of a tale here.<br />If you like your sci-fi mixed with some fantasy, then this one's for you.	2004-05-07

After reading Mythago Wood, I really got into this 2nd novel, but after a bout halfway through it, found it mired in non-movement.<br />The story did not progress as fast as Mythago Wood, and I can see why people didn't like it as much.  I found myself inthralled at the writing, which is excellent by the way, but at mid-way, found myself growing bored with no progression in the storyline.<br />I liked the overall dreamy feel and quality of this finely written novel, but I wanted more action and adventure like in the 1st one.  Tallis, along with some of the other mythago characters, are quite interesting to read about, but after a while, I felt like I was being force fed muddied dreams.  This is one of the few rare books or movie that gave me weird dreams, due to the strange imagery and wording, I suppose.<br />I think the next novel, The Hollowing, is much better than this one.  It has a much faster pace and I only have 60 pages left to read of it before I'm through.  I already like the pacing and more adventurous feel to this one.  It is much more like Mythago Wood.  Still in all, this author is well worth the try.	2004-03-07

Sure Mark Ellis is back - and he also is the master manipulator of the overall OUTLANDERS concept, design, and characterization, but this book was not his best.<br />But nor was it his worst.<br />The info-dumping and rehashing that seems to pollute each and every book now, is not so bad in this one.  That in and of itself, is a blessing.  But the problems I spotted were the unlikelyhood of the characters surviving a battle with Deathbirds right on top of them.  Come on, no way!  How could the pilots be so dim and slow witted?  And the cliche ending has been overdone!<br />Mark Ellis IS  a superlative writer, don't get me wrong.  But this particular storyline could have been much better if Maccan would have taken them through the mirror.  But alas, it was not to be, and this was still a most enjoyable novel in the series.<br />I totally disagree with the female reviewer:  I am an avid fan of both Deathlands and Outlanders, and I like them both, thank you very much!  Sure they are within the same universe, but are going in somewhat different directions.  Sure the Deathland's characters should be ever-changing and developing - but it is still great, fun, and exciting action/adventure reading!!<br />Hell, it used to be labelled - Action/Adventure back in the day.  And ultimately, that's what they are.  Mark Ellis is definately creating his characters to develop as the series goes on - and that's a good thing - something the author's and editors of Gold Eagle books needs to seriously consider to do more of in the Deathlands series.  <br />But I am the ultimate fan of these series.  I have been reading them religiously since their inceptions - some I've read 2 or 3 times!  Despite what others say, I believe for the most part - both Mel Odom and Victor Milan have written some fresh, infused blood into both series - and I hope they continue to.  Mark needs a vacation from time to time, does he not?<br />And coming from a writers POV, (of which I have recieved good reviewsfrom my work all over the world), despite the direction that Mr. Ellis decided to take this particular storyline, it was still a fun and exciting read.  Just not one of his best.<br />Whether you are a fan or not of this series, this novel is worth checking out.	2004-02-12

If you think this is a bad read - then you are a plain idiot, hands down!  Ben Counter pulls no punches, takes no prisoners in this massive world building, legendary novel.  It reads so beautifully, but after seeing the movie - RETURN OF THE KING - the battles there almost seemed tame in comparison to this one.<BR>Now, I would love to see the battle for the citidal in this book!

They talk and argue about today's movies and actors.  Mentioning big names such as Tarantino and John Woo was funny to read.  They are extremely colorful and bad ass to the core.<BR>One of my all time favorite characters, Sky Dog makes a reappearance here, and that is just an added bonus for this reader.<BR>Not everything is as it seems in this book, chock-full of tension and tenuous alliances that is sure to keep you riveted.<BR>The only reason I didn't give it a 10 was because it was full of awkward and wrong sentence structures.  Lots of editing mistakes here, but they are thrown to the side as the bullets and the fists fly.<BR>I for one can't wait for Milan's next novel in this universe.

Damn!<BR>The good part of this novel was the surprising set of the Vietnam of today, along with Zavello getting out into the field.  The promise of Swayne's father perhaps being one of the POW's.  These were all the strengths of this story.<BR>But all this was dashed away as the story was quagmired into too much gadgetry and not enough substance.<BR>God, I hope this series comes back, stronger than ever.<BR>It's only the fact that Sgt.

Dayton Ward's novel to me started very well but deteriorated into mediocre storytelling.  The aliens were just too much like humans to me.

This was the best part of the book for me.<BR>It was a much needed change of pace, but the alien world again was too much like earth.

This novel was the least of my favorites thus far in the series.  But the character of Night Runner is so engaging and cool, it keeps it interesting enough for this one to come back for more.<BR>I like all the characters of the 4-man team, they all have their differences in personality, but Night Runner truly shines.<BR>This is still a fun and fast read, but the action sequences were not as exciting this time around.

This newest installment of the once-legendary series is a step up from the previous couple of past novels, but still manages to fall short of its previous greatness that it once had.<BR>Again, we have a new writer who gives us a depraved and darkly sexual setting that DEATHLANDS has been known to have.<BR>The idea of the overall storyline was simple and been done before.  The characters were done pretty well this time, but I hated the fact that Ryan seems to ask the person he's getting ready to kill if they want to die first.  Stupid.  Ryan Cawdor is a chilling machine first and foremost!  <BR>The interesting part of this story was when Krysty and Ryan's relationship is put into jeapardy when she is captured as a sexual slave for the local barons delight.  The writer totally forgot that Krysty has the power of the Earth Mother to call upon, another writer who just throws a great time utilize this extremely interesting power - and chooses not too.<BR>Again, this particular writer forgets all about utilizing the nuke crazy weather to build great setting.  This, along with Krysty's power, has been tossed aside to make for yet another forgettable tale.<BR>There were a lot of editing mistakes that were overlooked here.  Ryan just comes up with weapons and a spyglass that he couldn't possibly possess at that particular time in the story.<BR>Oh, God, please make this tremendously once-awesome series come back in its full capacity with talented writers.<BR>I know quite a few writers out there that have made this series shine at one time or another.

It just never seems to stop amazing me what this particular author comes up with in terms of sheer sci-fi/fantasy entertainment.  Outlanders: Talon and Fang has taken this series to yet another level that is both thought provoking and pleasing to the reader.<BR>I love the concepts of time travel and such, and Mark Ellis puts our heroes - Kane and Grant - in a situation in which the past is all the chance they have left.  I won't ruin the awesome storyline for you, but suffice it to say, that with this great installment, Mr. Ellis has proven once again that he is undoubtedly one of the very best sci-fi writers out there today.  If you are lucky enough to be introduced to this man's series, then you have tons of great and fun reading ahead of you.<BR>I eagerly await, as always, the next part in this exciting and visually spectacular story arc and book series.  Hollywood needs to look away - for just a moment - from the comic books and seriously consider making this series their next blockbuster movie.  Even if people don't know anything about this remarkable writer and series, they would soon know as soon as they saw a trailer.<BR>This is not only action/adventure at its best, but also character driven stories that you will soon not forget.<BR>Thanks Mr. Ellis for being such a visionary, this reader/writer takes his hat off to you...	2003-05-08

Once again Mr. James Smith gives us another stripped down action adventure story of the 4-man team called Team Midnight.<br />This series doesn't waste any time in delivering the goods in terms of starting right off on the latest mission - or Event Scenarios - as they are called.<br />The best character surprisingly enough is the Gunny Sgt. called Night Runner.  I can't seem to get enough of this awesome character.  The leader Capt. Jack Swayne, though smart and tough and an interesting character himself, still takes a back seat to the Blackfoot warrior.<br />The newest member of the team is Greiner and so far, he fits in with the team.  But with Mr. James Smith at the writing helm, who knows how long he will last.  Thats one of the great things about this series - good guys die!  This makes it all the more interesting and believable.<BR>In this particular storyline, Night Runner makes a huge mistake on one of his teammates while out on a deadly mission.<BR>The sniper of the group is taken hostage by a very smart terrorist and makes the simple mop-up mission into a deadly race.<BR>This is by far one of the very best action/adventure series out there.  I usually don't read this kind of stuff, but this was one great find and Mr. Smith has a huge fan in me.<BR>This is a must read for anyone who reads sci-fi/fantasy heroic-type novels.

I have not read a David Alexander novel in a very long time, and reading this 1st novel of this series reminded me why.<BR>Now, don't get me wrong, Mr. Alexander is a very good writer and knows his stuff on weaponry and gadgets, but his downfall is characterization!<BR>I didn't get to know anyone except the leader of the special forces unit named Saxon and a couple of the spetsnaz bad guys.  And I didn't care much for any of them!!<BR>The Russian soldier named Batalin was the most promoted here.  I got to know what made him tick much more than the lead character here.  Saxon was written as a dead-beat dad which seemed rather unsavory to me.  No other member of this special team stood out or was introduced as anything other than a soldier.<BR>This lack of depth made the book lackluster to me because when people died - I didn't care!  There was no feeling here for any characters, none were really given much in the way of 'real-like people'.<BR>C'mon Mr. Alexander - you have more knowledge of missiles and all the gadgets than you do your characters.  This flaw made for a stiff read.  The action and adventure was there and written quite well, but lacked the force of other writers in this field such as James V. Smith.<BR>In my estimation, Mr. Smith's FORCE RECON series is far superior in both of these areas that Mr. Alexander missed upon.<BR>But I believe in 2nd chances.  I still think that the other novels in this series could perhaps be better.<BR>Who know?  But I'll let you know!	2002-12-29

The rawness and savagery are written extremely well with characters that are not perfect - but extremely interesting to delve into time and again.<BR>Sgt. Night Runner is by far the most interesting of the team with his American Indian background coming more and more to the fore with each novel, turning him into a warrior of old with new technology helping.<BR>What I like about this series is Mr. Smith always starts right off in the thick of things without bogging you down with boring political jargon.  His action scenes are very colorful and well thought out.  You can tell that he is a writer with firsthand experience with this.<BR>I normally don't read this type of genre, but thank god for Amazon.com for getting me interested.

They are quite interesting and different in looks and in their actions.  The beginning of the book was by far the best part because things go horribly wrong for the merc group and a few die very quickly.  The story is different and original, but I found myself after halfway thru - skimming through parts of way too many side characters that were not interesting to me personally, and I found myself rushing to the conclusion.  The idea of putting multi-universes mixed with dragons was great, but after a few chapters - that came to a stop and the story got bogged down. One of the upswings in the book was the unexpected killing off of \\"key\\" characters and bringing on new ones to join the Raven.  That I liked and wished that the action and adventure was kept up at a better pace.  It did not leave me wanting more personally - and thats a shame!	2002-06-07

Where the last title BREAKTHROUGH was fresh and original, this new one can't be anymore different. The storyline is so lame and boring with so many flaws, its the most painfully to read that I wished the company would rescind this novel completely - as if it never was written!  This is not a good way to introduce your new \\"look\\" much less give us hardcore fans this half-baked story.  There are too many deathlands fans and ex-fans clamoring to make this series end it seems, but I know there are too many talented writers out there that can keep this series alive and vibrant, and take it to its rightful next level.  It even seems that the cover artist Michael Herring also hated the story because this cover was boring and not as well drawn as his others.

The mutual love that Jos Metadi and Perada developed seemed to happen much too quickly from two people who saw the universe in such diverse ways.  It seemed that they were going at each other and the next chapter - were having kids!  That would have been better told if their relationship would have unfolded slowly.  Errec Ramsome as usual, stole the show again as the mysterious adept.  His story and character dominate this book byt far.  Another thing that I did not understand was why was not the 1st born the heir apparent?  It seemed that Perada had to have another child, but for what reason?<BR>Overall a good read, but not as good as the first trilogy.	2002-05-14

This new novel has a new face-lift cover as well as a new story arc that takes readers to the moon.  <BR>The DRAGON KINGS:Book #1 starts off with Kane, Grant, and Baptiste jumping into a small mess and side adventure that just leads us readers to the real &quot;meat&quot; of the story which involves finding a lost colony of both humans and aliens on the moon.<BR>Mark Ellis is back in full stride here, taking the Outlanders group back into outer space and into a new and larger scope in almost epic proportions in his latest installment.<BR>Sometimes the story took me way back and reminded me of old Edgar Rice Burroughs stories of John Carter Warlord of Mars type action and adventure.  <BR>Some of the moonscape scenes were so radical that even my fertile imagination could not conjure up the right and complete picture.  I know a good movie production or animation department could do it better, but it was definately larger-than-life seeming to me.  <BR>My only drawback here is the novel contained AGAIN the re-telling of an entire history lesson of mankind and alien interaction that takes alot of filler space.  Now, I don't know if this is done to fill space or to draw in new readers, but it is there again like in PURGATORY ROAD.<BR>Now, I am not the type of reviewer that tells you what happens in the novel play-by-play, but I will say that the ending was really interesting and a great cliffhanger.  It makes you want more - and is that not what its all about!<BR>So, for you oldtimer Outlanders fans, despite the filler stuff and the weak capture-part in the beginning, the strong finish line will leave you satisfied.  <BR>Thanks Mark, looking forward to your next book!	2002-05-09

This 1st novel is quite unique and well written for this first-time writer.  This new twist in sci-fi horror is a fast-paced thrill ride. The plot unfolds slowly and there are quite a few characters that shine and are delved deeply in.<BR>Ukiah Oregon is found as a wild boy with a pack of wolves.  He soon finds out that The Pack he really belongs to is a wild biker gang that is much more than it seems.  Ukiah is then thrown into finding his lost heritage and along the way he finds much more.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars is only because I thought that everybody around him just seemed to believe about his alien past a little too quickly and easily.  I really wanted to give this novel a higher rating but there were some small weak points that I thought needed more addressing in this story, but since then, I found that there is a sequel, so there is much more to go.

James Rollins' newest adventure tale takes us on a thrill ride filled with wonders of Mother Nature and freakish creatures.  This was an all around good read, but SUBTERRANEAN to me, was far better in action, adventure, and pace.<BR>Now dont get me wrong, this novel is chock full of that too, but to me personally, it just did not reach that &quot;fever pitch&quot; that his 1st novel gave off.  This one read very much like a very good movie at the theater than a novel.  <BR>But, thats just my opinion.  James Rollins always gives us a good romp in either genre in which he chooses to write, some are just better than others.  This newest is by far better than last year's DEEP FATHOM though, and I know he has not yet reached his peak.  Read this one for the sheer pleasure of an adventure story, but I warn you - the best is yet to come from this author! E-mail me Mr. Rollins/Clemens, you know I'm right.	2002-04-27

This new book(and author)launch us into a new universe filled with humans, aliens, and something in-between.  When joung Jos is taken prisoner and his past destroyed, the reader is then plunged into the machinations of a space pirate's legacy of torturous mind and body games.  The head pirate Flacone makes young Jos a pawn of his, forcing his mind and body to become his.  Then the alien's and strivs attack, taking young Jos with them.  He is then taken to the alien world and trained as an assassin and spy.  The young Jos is then tossed back as a spy for the aliens, to the human side.  There he becomes a Jet, a soldier on one of the best space cruisers.  This is when his loyalties collide and old friendships thought dead, come back to haunt this poor troubled young man.<BR>Karin Lowachee is a great writer and brings a lot of key characters to life, the writing of \\"feelings\\" is well done and the strife that this young man is going through is very well written.  The shades and overtones of sexuality throughout the novel will keep you guessing, it is quite unnerving to wonder what is going on behind all that pain and anguish.<BR>My only drawback to a five star was this area.  I found the touchy-feely thing went on a little too much. I really wanted more action and adventure, and Lowachee does give us that, but at a cost of pages of weeping and confused mind matters.  <BR>But overall the novel is large in scope and different in its range.  A fine 1st novel and good enough for this reader to want to try this author again.	2002-04-22

If you like novels in the grand tradition of William Sarabande's FIRST AMERICANS series, or like post-holocaust adventure stories - then this one's for you!<BR>Mitchell Smith's SNOWFALL is a well told tale of an Earth that has gone through another ice age and has taken civilization away, leaving cities such as Chicago, with snowdrifts as high as the tallest skyscrapers. It is never told what exactly happened to the earth, but it is told and hinted to a long, long, time ago as the story is taking place.<BR>The story opens with a band known as the Trappers, a small collection of families that united and hunt the frozen tundra of what once was Colorado,I think.  Their only link to the past is old journals and books that have been re-copied over and over thru time and they call copybooks. <BR>The first chapter starts right off with the hunters of the band getting food for their camp when they are attacked by Cree.  The Cree are the modern-day equivalent of indians, but most of their bloodline are white, they have just taken to the old indian ways of survival.  As the story goes on, the trappers are being forced out of their hunting grounds and being pushed south, along with all the other tribes from the north, like a dominoe effect.  Fighting to keep their land, the trapper's, along with an outcast that comes back named Jack, a losing fight ensues and most of the trappers are decimated and Jack finds himself a leader of a band on the run. The band's head doctor of the tribe is a clorful woman named Catania. Catania is much more than a doctor as the reader finds out as the story unfolds. I thought that this book would not have much action and adventure that I'm partial too, but it had it plenty enough along with lots of interesting characters to keep you glued to each page.  <BR>The adventures and tragedies that befall the running band of trappersas they flee ever southward is an enjoyable read as the reader see's the changes in the land and it's peoples as the trappers go deeper south.  The ending is not what I expected, but it was good nonetheless.  It read like an epic movie.  I recommend this book to anyone.	2002-04-02

This 2nd novel of the Tyrants and Kings trilogy was a good read but did not in my opinion surpass the 1st novel JACKAL OF NAR...the lack of magic using and the Triin peoples not being a strong part of this novel made it less enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, John Marco is a good writer and storyteller, but when I read fantasy, I really prefer all out fantasy with magic and strange peoples. The Triin are alien-like and an interesting and very integral part of this series. The parts I just did not care for is how the main character Richius Vantran gets pushed around and fooled easily without abandon! How does this hero survive being so easily trusting and shoved aside?  When Richius went thru all the training of the children just to let Prakna takeover without a fight?  Why did the Lissens need him for anyway if Prakna could lead them just as easily?  These were the weak points of the novel, but to end this review with a positive point - the overall writing and character building is done very well and the storyline went along smoothly. Using the story of the two brothers and the power of the birds was a real treat, I only wanted more of that in the book. Magic and mayhem - thats the key to true heroic fantasy!	2002-04-01

This newest novel brings us readers back to the world of a past novel titled \\"SHADOW WORLD\\", in which people from a parrallel universe come thru to our earth with armor and weapons of which the deathlands had never seen before.  Ryan Cawdor was kidnapped and taken to the other parrallel earth where a different kind of war was waged and Ryan earned a new name - SHADOW MAN.<BR>In this newest novel, a newer and bigger threat comes thru in the guise of gentetically engineered female warriors with the coolest weapons and huge wags that have not been introduced in this universe before. The leader female named Dredda otis Trask is a breath of fresh air in this series, she is a warrior bred for this kind of work and she is a colorful and interesting character indeed!  <BR>This novel is written so differently than your normal writers of Deathlands in that the writer takes you on a adventure rarely seen in this series such as parallel universe's that I hope Ryan and his band will visit more often.  The bad guys are so bad and well equipped in this novel that you really wonder how in the heck is Ryan and his band of warriors going to succeed in this one. The villains armor repels conventional bullets and the female warriors have superhuman strength with weapons that will turn you into a pile of goo.  <BR>My only complaint is the seemingly rushed ending and the final battle was a little disappointing to this hardliner action reader, but it left you wanting for more. Gold Eagle books needs to keep this writer around and I for one will be looking forward to their next book. This is a 16-year-veteran of DEATHLANDS who still thinks this series is still going strong. You folks who have given up on this series need to come back and try this one!	2002-03-03

Please do yourself a favor and read this novel that captures so many legends and myths that will leave you questioning and thinking of your own beliefs that we were all led to believe for eons.

I have been noticing this growing authors books for some time and thanks to the great reviews here at Amazon.com, I finally tried this first novel and am glad I did.  The writing and flow of the storyline was never a chore or boring. It was an epic in scope and for a first novel very compelling with lots of different characters.  A bold new fantasy writer that has surpassed a lot of other fantasy writers and came to the forefront in just a few novels. I will definately read the rest of this trilogy and the newest series titled \\"THE EYES OF GOD\\".<BR>I only had a few reservations about Richius Vantran the jackal of nar in the fact that he was not always a believable nor likeable hero at times. He did not seem to be as tough as one would think at times of need.  I really liked the alien-like Triin peoples.  Lucyler and Voris were more of my favorites as far as main heroes that seemed tough enough to deal with the narens. But the bad guys were colorful and it was a fun and interesting read, highly recommended.	2002-02-12

This newest OUTLANDERS novel is again written by Mel Odom who has brought us such good stories as &quot;WREATH OF FIRE&quot;, but unlike that one, this good try at the OUTLANDERS universe is good but a near miss once again with somewhat good storylines and interesting characters but that somehow falls short and flat compared to Mark Ellis's original storyline and character building that will continue in the next book.<BR>This book starts right off with Kane and company stalking thru the woods and encounter slavers and of course a battle ensues.  Now, the battle scene itself was done well except for when the companions split up and start yelling to each other and giving their position away that really thru me for a loop!!  Combat smarts did not come to play here, and Domi especially would not have run her loud mouth counting her dead as she &quot;silently&quot; stalked and killed her baddies.  Now, do you know what I mean?  The interesting part of the story was the main bad guy and his woman who were pretty colorful and had a strange relationship that bordered on psychopathic love. He and Kane somehow have met and battled in past lives in other guises, places, and with different names.  Why has this not been noticed before in this series?  I dont know, I say, I just read and review em! This stuff seems to be just filler inbetween the original stories and just seems to give the original author more time to come out with quality instead of just quantity.  If these two gifted authors collaborated more often maybe we would get more out of this series.	2002-02-08

Hmmmm, lets see, personally I thought it started out with a fresh and interesting story on an alien invasion with LOTS of characters both good and bad.  Then the storyline tended to wallow in too much military jargon and political intrigue for me. The ending was very action-packed but by then I had found myself skim-reading just to get to the end. There was just way too much goings-on from the middle to the end for me to keep my interest going. Too many unimportant military people to follow bogged down this great idea of a story.	2002-01-17

In this newest novel of the Wit'ch series, James Clemens takes the readers to the far corners of his fantasy world of Alasea.  From the deserts wastelands to the highest mountains of the dreaded Gul'gotha where the Dark Lord reigns. From floating cityscapes of El'vin ilk to just about everything inbetween, the writer takes us on a voyage of high action and adventure filled with magick and wonders.  As usual, some new characters come in to play and some old characters die off, leaving the reader wanting more.  Clemen's writing style is ever growing and expanding upon each novel.  Its kind of strange that near the end of the new novel, there is a strange character that reminded me alot of this certain character in the novels and books that is a key and vital piece to the novels. Now, of course I'm not going to tell you and ruin the book and movie at one fell swoop, now would you?  Read the novel and see the movie!	2001-12-19

This was the place that Ryan and J.B. had found their long-lost leader of the war wags - the Trader.  He is only mentioned but does not come out of the woodwork so to speak.  Its a shame really, because having the Trader come back would be a great addition to the storyline.  <BR>Anyway, The group find that this section of Seattle is being fought over by two groups: normal humans that live underground and a large group of muties led by the one called - Sunchild.  Now this is one of the most bizarre mutated people that this series has made up for awhile and its a shame that that part of the story isn't delved into deeper.  Ryan and the survivors are captured by the norms and taken underground to their hidden base.  Here they find that the baron is a nice man for once, but his wife is not, she is plotting against her husband along with the sec chief. The wife has more than a hidden agenda up her sleeve, and this also makes this a more interesting story, but again falls short.  The norms employ Ryan and the group to help them wipe the scrouge of the muties once and for all, but to their dismay, they find that the muties have an old nuclear bomb in their camp. Now this complicates matters some, plus there is infighting among Ryan's group and the mean norms, the head sec chief gives Ryan enough grief that I was waiting for Ryan to lop-off his head at any moment, but unlike Ryan of old, he does nothing to my consternation.  The weak part of the story is the action as the norms storm the muties camp a couple of times.  The action sequences are flat and not as well done as they usually are. The storyline had threads of great ideas but was narrowed and never seemed to expand. Come on writers, take this series to the next level - its high time to do this - dont hold back on us readers!	2001-12-17

I have been reading the Casca novels since it first came out in the early 80's and still own the first 14 novels, after that they fell towards bad writing oblivion for me. Barry Sadler's death was very sad and so was the Casca series for me.  I am very glad to see a new writer come in and try to take the reins for the new series, but for some reason I find myself skimming thru lots of paragraphs to the end.  I don't want to bash a good writer, but Paul D. seems to bring to life a Casca of old very well.  His feelings and his mannerisms are all there like Barry Sadler used to write, but the action scenes to me are not written very well and are bogged down with flat battle sequences.  For example, when Casca finally confronted the bad guy who killed his beloved, the build-up of the fight was finished much too quickly and easily.  Barry Sadler's fight scenes and his revenge scenes were shocking and well written in an action-type way that left the reader satisfied. Paul is a gifted writer when it comes to the feel of the past and with customs of the peoples in history, but it is too bogged down with nothing really happening.  Barry Sadler's books for the most part were less than 200 pages and the fat was trimmed off. I dont see how these other people can give this new Casca book 4 to 5 stars after they have read Barry's books, but to each his own I say.  Keep trying Paul, I know these are big shoes to fill but I know you can do it better next time, Casca is too great of a character not to give another try for old time sakes!	2001-11-28

I dont even play computer games but the novel intrigued me in its presentation and book cover.  Now, I have heard of this game and its new system coming out and I have tried a few game/novels out and have not been impressed - UNTIL NOW!  Eric Nylund's writing is great and I already have two other books from him since I read this novel.  Mr. Nylund's story telling and bigger than life characters in this book make it clearly above and beyond just a game book.  The story starts out with a woman named Dr. Halsey who is creating a super soldier for the future war that is coming in the guise of an alien race that seems unstoppable and unknown to earthlings in any way shape or form.  Dr. Halsey and her accomplice Jacob Keyes take a dozen children from orphanages and make them into super beings thru endless surgeries, drugs, and a battle school that is far superior and secret than normal military.  The leader, and main character comes from a boy/man they call number 117, or John.  John is not the strongest or the fastest, but he has the mind of a leader.  The reader then goes on a journey thru these poor kid's boot camp and watch them fail as well as conquer their own fears and others prejudice.  This insight and character development, mixed with great action sequences is what saves this novel from being just another fast written game book for the boys.  The author's writing style is made for this type of novel and it shows in every space battle as well as groundside wars as well.  This novel goes thru about 25 years or so, so you get to follow the kid's growth, as well as some of the other normal humans rise and falls thru the years.  The aliens are introduced slowly and revealed for who and what they are in a way that keeps the reader wanting to read more to find out - very smart!  If you love military space opera with lots of great action with lots of great characters written in - then you will find that this is not just another game novel - I can't wait for the new book!	2001-11-13

This latest novel of the Outlanders saga is by far one of the best to date.  Mark Ellis is back with a vengeance!  The book starts off where PURGATORY ROAD left off, our charismatic characters Kane, Grant, Baptiste, and Domi are back in what was once Chicago looking for further evidence on just what happened on that fateful day when Domi was supposedly imploded and dissappeared.  Their searching of course is interrupted by a severe chem storm and a strange supply of characters with arcane powers.  The small group are split up and vulnerable to the strange denizens of the doomed metropolis and a mad mother nature.  If die-hard fans of Deathlands will remember, this was the only place that held a chron-jumping facility and the story deals with this and a diabolical character comes back stronger than ever - and die-hard fans of this series will remember him!  The ideas behind this storyline are many and great, I always loved the concept of time travel.  The background 'feel' of this particular novel really enhanced the story along with the new breed of bad guys that are introduced here. I find it hard to review a book and not give anything away for the readers to enjoy, so I won't ever do that, but for all you newcomers and avid fans alike - this one's for you! As always, it leaves you wanting more and more.  I hope that time travel is delved ever deeper in this series that can take it to a whole new level. Will our small band of heroes get trapped in time?  Read this latest novel and find out.	2001-11-12

I literally just finished reading this exciting novel just a couple of hours ago and just had to review this exciting and fun read to you readers out there.  TIMELINE begins with an enigmatic and corporate chewer named Doniger whom has finally thru many hard years of work, has finally found out how to travel thru time. It is kept a secret for awhile, but like all large and important secrets - this one is unraveling fast, getting ready to be exposed.  Professor Johnston is a renowned historian who is trying to put history back together again by gathering around himself a small group of student historians who love him like a father.  The historians are in France, studying old ruins of mills and castles of the 14th century.  The historians work is owned ans run by none other but the ILT Corp, which is owned by the scrupulous Mr. Doniger himself!<BR>When professor Johnston finds out that the company he is working for is holding secrets of his hard work, he confronts his boss Mr. Doniger, who tricks his employeee to literally go back in time to see his ruins firsthand.  Mr. Doniger traps him in time so his secret is not leaked to the press which professor Johnston would surely do since their disagreement.  The professor is stuck in time, a time where knights run amok and kill everything in sight - especially strange looking people!<BR>The professor's students find a message in the ruins of the castle they are studying from the professor from the distant past! This sets them on a course with history that they cannot fathom.  The company sends them back in time to save their teacher from a brutal and savage time period. Disaster strikes just minutes when they arrive, and the students are thrown into action and adventure that Michael Crighton writes so well. The plot and pace of this novel are very enjoyable and never bogged down with too much detail.  My favorite character was Marek, a student of the time period whom has studied the 14th century to so much detail, that heknew all about jousting and swordplay that come to the groups much needed help in the distant past.  The ending was good and a little sad which makes it rememberable.  If you like a good tale with plenty of action and want to see what it was like in the 14th century - read this one!	2001-11-06

This wonderfully written novel by James Byron Huggins is a great and fun read of a history that I personally was not aware of. The novel of Rora reminded me of great epic movies such as Braveheart.  I love the fast paced writing and awesome dialogue that Mr.Huggins always has in his books. The heroes are larger than life and the evil-doers are just as colorful. It is always a good thing when you can read a book and learn something from it as well as enjoy a great read at the same time as I did in this book. There is something here for everyone to enjoy - history, action, adventure, religion, and even a little romance threw in. When the village of Rora refuses to surrender their faith and the war of the hated Inquisitors begins, so does a novel of greatness unfold before you as a small band of determined people withstand the forces of a large army that soon learns that this is a very different type of war that they bargained for.  Political intrigue abounds as well as assassins in the night, all for the grace of God - or is it really for something else?  You really must find out on your own in this well written novel.	2001-10-30

This 1st volume in the 6-book series was almost made into hollywood gold back in the mid-eighties by none other than Arnold himself. Though it obviously did not happen, this would have been a major miss-cast because the man in the book did not resemble Arnold at all and was his own unique character.  <BR>The WARLORD is a great novel of a man with a sordid past whom is forced thru circumstance to revert back to his training both as a special forces soldier and his background in growing up with the indians and learning to survive.  This unique individual named Eric Ravensmith and his family are plunged into a world gone mad when earthquake tremors turn California into an island unto itself, and to make things worse, its protected by a bubble of toxic waste that no one can leave or enter, thus leaving anarchy to rule.  Ravensmith reverts back to his training in both areas of his expertise to save both his family and the fate of the state of California against his ruthless past in the form of his former commander in the military back in his vietnam days.

This second novel to HEROES DIE was not your standard approach to your everyday sequel, which made it even more interesting. This novel was more epic in scope and vision than the 1st novel. Overall the book was a terrific read and was full of interesting characters and ideas, it was like reading a fantasy/horror/sci-fi novel. The blend of genres meshed well together. My only complaint was the final fight sequence between Caine and Ma'elkoth - it was so built up and ended much too quickly and easily, and I could not wait for Caine to get back on his feet again - it took entirely too long for that! But if you like your fantasy on the darker edge and like the unusual with hard-edged action - this ones for you!

His 1st novel is still the best written in my opinion.  Where &quot;SUBTERRANEAN&quot; went, this newest novel just didn't reach.  The storyline was great in its idea and scope, but the flow of the story just didn't grab me like his previous two novels did.  The ending was good and very inventive though, but the action and sheer adventure seemed somewhat lax in this one. I really was looking forward to this one but as I started reading it, I found myself just not gripped nor caring for the female characters in this one.  It read like it was rushed into publication. But this is just my opinion, obviously other people loved this one according to the other reviews, and rightly so, since this author has yet to write his magnus opus. But I will eagerly await his next work in both fields that he writes in, which is fantasy as well as in fiction adventure.  Look for his other series which is written under the pen name James Clemens, the WITCH WAR series.	2001-08-10

This latest (and last?) of a great series ends in the form of the AVENGERS. The 3rd in this trilogy of terror is as always a great read with lots of twists and turns. The main characters of the story evolve along with the monster vampires, and Lumley even throws in some love triangles in the mix that don't slow down the pace one bit. The 3 vampire lords as always are written with style and gore, making them truly monsters and a scourge of the human race. Jake Cutter as the new necroscope grows into his own and fills the shoes of the original necroscope - Harry Keogh - quite well and is a great character in my estimation. His bold and cocky attitude makes him an outsider to the others of the group until harry manifests himself to the group and brings them together as a whole - working and fighting together to rid the earth (once and for all?) of the vampire lords and their thralls. The human race has been infected with the fungus spores and thralls are abounding, a group of serious-minded soviet soldiers of the worst kind are holding the Perchorsk Gate, getting ready to invade and conquer the vampire world of Sunside/Starside along with Harry's son Nathan who is fighting the last battle with the vampire lords in that alternate world, not knowing of the impending invasion, the 3 vampire lords on earth are rampaging through our world, leaving death and destruction as well as undeath in their wake! All of this mess and more is left to E-branch and the new necroscope to contend with - isn't that enough? Brian Lumley moves the storyline along with his usual panache - the plot is thick and the action is furious with an ending that I did not expect. I like the unexpected and so will you. I only can hope that Brian Lumley will return to this world he has created some day with a new series of the future, because if you know Lumley like I know Lumley - then you know that the future is as always, a most devious thing...	2001-07-18

This new and inventive book set in the TERMINATOR movie series world is a bold and exciting romp. S.M. Stirling does a great job in entering this arena and keeping the characters alive and vibrant with new twists that does not detract from the feel of the movies. The storyline is a great read just by itself with the new characters written with flair. The new woman terminator is a whole new species of robot called the INFILTRATOR, thus the title. She goes back in time to once again try what the other terminators could not do - stop the Connor's from destroying skynet.  The writer does an awesome job in not only taking us back to the terminator universe, but adding years and characterization to Sarah and John Connor that does the series justice. And then throwing a look-a-like terminator that is human into the mix and the developing love story between the two was interesting to follow. Stirling doesn't pull punches either when it comes down to the action scenes, they are well written and very much have the feel of the movie versions of taking you back to certain locations and people. The ending was interesting and left you wanting for more - what more can you ask for? Great job Mr. Stirling, please may I have another!	2001-07-03

This 2nd in the skydark chronicles was definately a lot different than the 1st installment. It was mainly a filler for the conclusion it seems, since it was one battle leading into yet another battle. There did not seem to be a storyline in this one as in the last one. Now don't get me wrong - the action is fast and furious,(and extremely brutal), and I love all that savagery that has made deathlands a huge hit, but you have to have interesting story development and character interaction to make it whole and complete hit. This is what has been lacking in the storylines since the premature demise of the one and only original writer who launched this incredible journey. The writers now are extremely talented in trying to imitate and clone if you will, Ryan Cawdor and company - and some even hit the mark and take it to the next level as it was needed at the time. Now Judas Strike is a fun read and full of excitement and was never dull for me but it just lacked that great storytelling that SAVAGE ARMADA had, not just filler for the 3rd. I also do not understand the title either - SKYDARK CHRONICLES sounds like something that is going to be told right after skydark, or something discovered, but this storyline to me has not revealed anything of that nature!?  Perhaps in the 3rd installment SHADOW FORTRESS, everything will be revealed and the great story mixed with action and character development will continue. One can only hope.	2001-06-09

I read the novel and was totally blown away from the very beginning and it just got better and better!  Hari Michaelson is an actor of the future who is transported along with a few other actors, including his wife, to another world and or dimension called OVERWORLD. Here in this fantasy-filled world the actors go on ADVENTURES that are followed back on earth by the populace by virtual reality-based technology. The whole book reminded me of the Matrix but in a fantasy set world. This would make a blockbuster movie idea by the way since this is a mix of sci-fi and fantasy with a writer who has written an excellent and thought-provoking idea that readers will love due to its great characters both good and bad, (and inbetween). The god emperor MA'EL-KOTH, the giant who rules in this fantasy land is a very interesting character and you just can't wait to see what he will do next. Hari Michaelson aka Caine in Overworld is such a rich and engaging character in both worlds is just a plus in this extravaganza of a novel. This si definately a one of a kind, ground-breaking read in both the sci-fi and or fantasy realm. Please do yourself a favor and get this book to read - you won't be sorry!	2001-05-21

This latest installment of the ending trilogy as usual - leaves you wanting more,and puts more questions in your mind about just what direction is this writer going to take this story? The beginning of the story opens with a bang! Starting just where we left our intrepid heroes in the last book, a war against the two rival clans of samurai vying for power. The relentless pace of the book is just a hallmark trade of Mr. James Axler, aka Mark Ellis, the man just does not write a bad book. This series is steeped in plots within counter subplots and conspiracies that even though I understand whats going on - I dont think I could explain it to someone else, ya know what I mean?  I'm not sure which plot to believe in this x-files on acid trip sci-fi action adventure series!  But it sure is fun to see the series and characters grow and change. I love the changes of some of the characters, and to tell you what they are in the new book would ruin it, so mums the word. All I can say is, read it and enjoy it - even if you cant tell which is the real reality and which isn't. My only complaint about this book is the re-iteration throughout this particular novel was too much for me, but I know that the writer must do this for new readers to understand, and or to refresh memories of us older folks. And also the dinosaurs that were hinted at in book 2 were only touched on a little in this new novel as well, and I really wanted more of that, but I am sure thats for a future novel right?  Outlanders of the Jurrassic coming soon to a bookstore near you!	2001-05-04

The best part of the novel is the beginning in my opinion. The infamous Allander Atlasia is in a futuristic-type prison called ALCATRAZ II by its inmates, which are the worst of the worst in the U.S.  The daring escape of Allander was very well written and then the game (or chase) is on! Then enters - The Tracker, ex-FBI agent Jade Marlowe. He is a most obnoxious person and no one likes him, including me, the reader. Now, I know the writer was trying to paint us a picture of a different kind of cop-chaser and thats all fine, but this guy is way too callous to care much for. He was not believable because of his work ethic, no police force of any kind would have put up with this guys shinanigans. This is the weakness of the novel. This guy broke so many rules and regulations, as well as civilian casualties, that he would have been arrested himself no matter who he was. Allander is the real strong point and character in the book, I almost wanted him to get away just so I can read about him again in a sequel, like Hannibal Lector. I would have liked to see the Marlowe character get his clocked cleaned - just once!  His partner Travers was of course a beautiful agent, forced to help Marlowe, and like me, she hated him.  I knew somehow that they would have a love affair, and thank god the writer kind of only skimmed the surface with that. The good thing about the novel was that overall it was a fast-paced thrill ride, and that bumps it up a good notch for me personally. The action scenes I thought could have been written better, I would think that the final showdown between the two would have been a little bit more explosive. Actually it read like a hollywood movie, and would probably make a good movie if you are not into cop thriller/action movies than more realistic-type cop dramas. Its worth the read though, so check it out folks!	2001-04-11

Do yourself a favor and call up all the used book stores in your area and find this trilogy of books. The cover and back explanation does not do it justice whatsoever.                    The story starts out with a bang with the lead character named Tonomori, an honorable samurai who is the bodyguard of the Daimyo of his clan and they are in the midst of a fued with another clan on the battlefield. Tonomori shows early off here that he is the ultimate samurai warrior. But, when his king or &quot;Daimyo&quot; is struck down due to his own son's screw-up, the evil and ambitious son blames it on Tonomori.  Tonomori is then banished and forced to become what he depises most - A RONIN! Thats a samurai without honor or a mercenary.  He eventually meets up with a dutch party that is leaving japan and thus starts the main quest for our fallen hero. He vows to come back with knowledge of the new world and strike down all of his enemies and become once again an honorable samurai. Onboard ship he meets a beautiful dutchess that is secretly being taught to become a ninja by night by none other than a japanese servant woman named Norika. Now the chemistry between these three is fun to read and mixed with alot of action and adventure makes for one of the best books I have ever read. This is epic stuff!! I can't wait to read the other two titled &quot;DAIMYO'S REVENGE&quot; and &quot;DAIMYO'S CONQUEST&quot;.	2001-03-19

This 5th installment may not be the best of the series, but all of Terry Goodkind's novels are still well written with very well written and fleshed out characters of all kinds.  Now, to me personally, this is the least of my favorite in the series, but it is by no means a bad read - OH NO!  The pace sometimes is so fast and exciting, it more than makes up for the pages that have no action, adventure, and tons of magic that is usually associated with this series.  Also, Gratch and the dragon are sorely missed, but Richard, Kahlan, and Cara are such colorful and always interesting characters that I literally flipped thru pages that seemed endless without them, just to see how much further I had to read to get back to them!!  But overall, it was still a good story and I would recommend it, even though its not THE BEST, it is still a chapter in a big series and must be read.	2001-03-13

In fact, I have only read all of the Rambo novels plus one other titled BLOOD OATH, and I personally did not like it. Now this book grabbed me by the throat and did not let go until 3 days later when I was done with the book. I love books about raw survival mixed with lots of action and adventure - and this book gave me some of that.  The story of this man's life turning to hell in a handbasket is a fast-paced read with some sad surprises near the end that I personally did not expect. There were times where some of the stuff became a little redundant, and I wish that the main bad guy - Kess - was introduced along with his faceless cronies chasing this poor man and his family. The revenge part of this book was written a lot differently than I thought it was going to, and folks thats about all I can tell you about it without ruining it. This was a very strange and bizarre look at the extremes a person can go when his family is in deadly danger.	2001-03-13

This is a book that was beautifully written and full of high action and adventure. A mixture of pirates and the likes of Davey Crockett - a mix that I never would have even thought about in a novel, but it is done with grace and a fast pace that it was hard to put down. I never usually read this kind of genre but let me tell you that if you don't either - you should!! The characters were so full and rich with the wonderfully-written scenery that you really felt like you were there. Now, I have to admit I only read this on a dare, and the more I got into it, the more I liked it because it had a different approach to the famous and legendary War of the Alamo. Plus I was raised right in San Antonio all my life until my early 20's, so I also kind of felt a kinship if you would to this novel. But believe me when I say that the heroe William Wallace is brought to such vivid life both as a great knife fighter, but also as a man filled with inner turmoil over his brothers death and a love that is forbidden.  The love story is also very well told and not boring for us HE-MAN types. The pirate Mad Jack who saves our hero and teaches him the way of the knife is both engaging and very funny at times to read.  The bad guys are very villanously written and a pure delight to read and hate. The action scenes were well written and plentiful as well as all the locations written about made you feel the heat, smoke, and flies buzzing around. I will definately add this fresh and exciting writer to my book-reading pleasure - as well as you should if you like well-rounded stories of high adventure, romance, and heros that are larger than life!	2001-02-16

This new and fast-paced thriller of Alex Cross, Doctor and detective, is a cut above the last few books in my opinion. A string of bizzarre and brutal bank robberies sets Alex Cross and the FBI on a wild chase on a criminal mastermind who calls himself - well, the MASTERMIND of course! The robberies and murders are so strange and masterfully planned out that all the cops are baffled.  A new and engaging character is introduced in this novel, and FBI agent named Betsey Cavilierre. Alex Cross and her work closely together - and I mean CLOSELY!  They strike up a serious relationship since poor old Alex's other love interest goes south because of her previous kidnapping, causing her to get away from Alex, and also leaving him with their new son.  The twist and turns you expect from this author is certainly there and I never found myself bored reading this fast moving book - and thats a plus!  A very surprise ending is in here as is usually the case in the Alex Cross novels, and I dont think you will be dissappointed in this one. ENjoy the read peeps - peace out!	2001-01-17

I usually dont get into war novels but this one intrigued me due to the fact that it was mainly about two men hunting each other amongnst a huge and dirty war raging all around them. Also there was an interesting angle in this story that the two antagonists were so much alike, and yet so different in background and country. The characters were very rich and interesting, and I liked the American woman turned sniper angle also, that was done very well.  The only reason I did not give it a 5-star rating was the ending was quite too abrupt for me as a reader. I was not sure what happened to the survivors and the final confrontation between the two men was not as exciting as I have read in other action-like novels. But still a good read and I am looking forward to the movie coming out on this book in February titled &quot;ENEMY AT THE GATES&quot;.	2001-01-03

This new and exciting new novel takes Ryan Cawdor and his warrior survivialists to a jump into a ghost town, haunted by some very interesting creatures that resemble some kind of enormous bats. These mutie creatures only come out at night and are extremely fast and deadly.  This new writer to me does a wonderful job in keeping with the characters IN CHARACTER. The pace is swift and action scenes are very well done. Even the writers flying creatures are somewhat a story unto themselves instead of just your run-of-the-mill mindless creatures. The writer gives them depth and makes you wonder just where they came from - mutated or man-made? These mysterious monsters attack Ryan and his band in the haunted ruins of Zero City, leaving Ryan's son, Dean, wounded and near death. This forces the group to split up and go into a nearby ville ruled by a mad baron that may be some kind of cousin to Krysty Wroth. Now this is what sparks interest in the baron when he see's the similarities between himself and Krysty.  For me, this was the best part of the book when Ryan and Krysty go alone into this strange ville and Krysty is taken captive. The writer is at his best in this part of the novel and the action scenes are some of the best I have read in this awesome series. The unspoken communication between Ryan and Krysty is very well done, and I am always a sucker when these two gell and have a little adventure together without the group constantly being there.  The baron makes fertilizer out of the people that screw up in the ville and Charleston Heston aint around to save the day. But Ryan Cawdor is! This latest from the great story-telling writers of Gold Eagle is a very fun and exciting read for the hardcore DEATHLANDS fans.  I am such a fan and I want to extend my thanks to Gold Eagle books and the creative minds at work in this series for keeping up the great work and thank you for not giving up in this awesome series.  MERRY CHRISTMAS!	2000-12-07

This is my 7th novel that I have read by this author and I am never dissappointed. Every book that I read by this very diversified author is never the same as the last one. From horror to sci-fi and beyond, this author delivers! STINGER reads like a fast-paced horror/sci-fi that would make an awesome movie. The small town of Inferno,Texas is the crash sight of a most unusual alien life-form that takes over a little girl. This good alien is soon followed by the bad alien bounty hunter that is so colorful and scary that I dont want to ruin the surprise.  As usual, the author introduces many interesting characters that band together to fight the bad alien and its collective minions. Two rival gangs of teenagers were my favorite characters because the author shows the reader that the prejudice's between mexicans,Indians, and whites are all a waste of ill-feelings, that in the end, we must all band together and endure.  A must read!!	2000-11-17

Doom Dynasty is the 1st of an all new trilogy that starts with a bang and leaves you with a cliffhanger and wanting more! This series just like X-files, leaves you with questions and mysteries about us and the universe surrounding us. It's an action/adventure novel with true brain teasers and insight. The ideas and concepts in this novel are mindboggling but so fun to read. The story starts out with a bang as per Mark Ellis's style, with Mags attacking and destroying a small ville and taking few prisoners as slaves.  Kane and his trio of friends are right behind them in pursuit, all the while fighting off mutie insects and snakes.  They happen to encounter some bright new characters in the desert - samurai warriors!  These colorful and interesting new characters enrich the series to a new level and a new love interest is in the works as well.   As the series goes on, the characters evolve and grow and that is what makes a successful series.  You see some new sides of Grant and Domi in this one and it makes for an interesting read. For true fans as well as new readers alike: you must read this book!  You can catch on here and get hooked if you have not read the past novels, or for you fans - Balam is back (finally), and is not a very happy camper!

In GONE SOUTH, a tortured man's past and his present predictament clash, and Dan Lambert is caught in a web of murder and running from the law, bounty hunters, and from himself deep into the louisiana bayous.  The two bounty hunters are very different and interesting to read about. The very strangeness and bizarre are very apparent in this sojourn into the heart and soul of finding redemption.

Following the 1st book - THE SCORPION, some of the same characters came back to continue their roles in this continuing saga of the far east. This author did a fine job of keeping the storyline in sync with the first with the empress Kachiko plotting and planning the destruction of her enemies. The Lion returns as a disgraced ronin with his flashing katana and honor-bound character ever striving. The new characters were very interesting, of course best of all was the main character Tetsuko the battle maiden. This woman had some past horrors tormenting her and strove the whole way to become a legend in her own right. The lead male characters were well written and I was hoping for the poor battle maiden to finally find some love in her life, but I guess it was not to be.  This novel had a little more fantasy-based figures in it than the first one, which is what it needed. Lots of action and adventure which I love.  Looking forward to the next installment - The Crane!	2000-09-25

I really should have given this riveting read a 5 star but I just want to  hold out because this new author is just getting better. CRASH DIVE was a  really great, fun read - but TIGER REEF in some ways was better. For one  reason is that Sasha was in this one more, and she is a cool character,  beautiful but one tough cookie! I like that in a woman. Ben Gannon and her  have a real good relationship and really help balance out the storylines.  The story begins with them on a long voyage taking off right where it left  off in CRASH DIVE. But its not long when they run into trouble with pirates  and poachers, and the story just explodes off the page with this wonderful  new writers charisma for storytelling that just is never slow or boring.  Each chapter just builds up characters good and bad, and the action and  adventure never stops. This is not a man's book either, women would love  the love, action, adventure, and exotic locales which all blend together  beautifully in this great series. My wife usually does not care to read  this type of book but even she loved it. This is the kind of stuff that  hollywood movies should be made of. Does anybody out there in movieland  here me - this guys got sequels!

I am not a diver and did not quite understand all of  the diving and sailing stuff but it was a relentless action/adventure story  with some good surprises - and I like that!

I like Ben  Gannon and his woman Sass, and the cajun friend Rolly was fun to follow.  The bad guys were bad and colorful and Sligo was exhausting to read with  his constant cocaine snorting and relentless smuggler's smack.

I hope that the next  novel, (the last-darn-it), carries us back to the vampire world of  sunside/starside, which is where this author does his best work in my  opinion. I like the new necroscope Jake Cutter and his love interest Liz  Merrick, but they are hardly together in this novel, but they are  surrounded by other E-branch people who all have their own unique powers  which is always fun to read. I reccommend this book highly and am waiting  eagerly foe the final showdown and book in this long-lasting series.	2000-08-22

The latest in this magnificent series is yet another great and fun read as Kane and his small group run afoul of a new but ancient enemy from the  past. I always love this Celtic/past lives stuff that this remarkable  storyteller mixes in so well with this post-holocaust series. This book was  by far some of the grittiest-as-yet, down-and-dirty action scenes that I  can remember.  Man, that Kane can take some serious punishment - and give  it back two-fold! I love the character Fand and how she was portrayed in  this book was really exciting to read. She is sexy as well as a good  fighter to boot. Such colorful characters and places mixed with tons of  high action adventure scenes make this book one of the very best I have  read. Mark Ellis is surely at the top of his game and full in his writers  prime. Keep up the great work, you are definately giving DEATHLANDS a run  for its money. You will love this new chapter for new or old reader fans -  a must read!	2000-08-10

This 3rd adventure was  action-packed and fast-paced as all of his novels, whether he is writing  fantasy or thrillers - James Clemens,aka James Rollins always gives you a  run and fun read. The one thing I don't understand is how on earth can  anyone give this writer a 1 or 2 star review!? The pace is always on the go  and the action plentiful. All the characters are colorful and more than a  one-dimensional character.  He may not be inventing the wheel - but the  wheel is always rolling! I love some of the twists and turns he always  plays with in every one of his novels. Are all the good guys good? Are all  the bad guys bad? Sometimes you just don't know. Kral really changed in  this book - literally!  I really dont write reviews by telling the people  what happened to who and when, because that gives it away for others and  thats not fair. You hardcore fantasy fans as well as all you others,- its  simply this - if you like strong characters of all kinds mixed with lots of  action and adventure, a story that moves along like a freight train - well  this one should not be passed! Read all of this guys awesome books by both  his alia's and take it from someone who has been reading just about  everything for over 35 years - he's a winner and a must read author!	2000-08-08

Now I have read a ton of the best of fantasy books and series by top authors, and to me TROLLSLAYER was well written and action-packed, but due to its short story type book, it was not an epic.  But for a book to be  linked with a huge sci-fi WARHAMMER link, it was very well in the other  direction in the fantasy genre and a fun read.  This author William King is  a gifted writer and I already purchased the other two novels of Gotrek and  Felix, as well as the new SPACE WOLF, which really sounds like a good one!   Anyway, if you like your fantasy short and violent, kind of reminded me  somewhat of Robert E. Howards shor Conan stories - dark and violent with  colorful heroes and monsters and sorceror's.  My only real complaint about  the book was the last storyline at the end seemed very rushed and did not  clinch like it should.  Perhaps because there are two more books, I dont  know. And also the real main character of the story to my surprise was the  human Felix. I thought Gotrek was and very little was told about his  character and background. But again, perhaps its in the other two books eh?   Its a good read though, so enjoy.	2000-07-25

I literally just finished James Rollin's new novel EXCAVATION and was very entertained. It again has his flair of great characters and evil villains and weird beasts, but his style of always leaving you wanting more as well  as letting you know that this is far from over!  Ah, possible sequels,  right James! Just like hollywood - smart move.  But as much as I liked this  new novel, I couldn't help but compare it to SUBTERRANEAN, and to me  personally, I thought EXCAVATION came in a close 2nd. But this is a  fast-paced, fun read and again, like his other novels, both thrillers or  fantasy novels, they would make and read like good movies. The locations  and people's were colorful, the action aplenty, and a novel that makes you  wonder - where is this leading to? This all makes you want to keep reading.  The good things about his novels are that, to me, they never truly slow  down enough to where you get bored, and thats very important. This is a  must read for people who like their Indiana Jones-like adventure.  Also  read his other great works under the name James Clemens, you won't be  dissapointed!	2000-07-17

This is one of over half a dozen new novels that is based on a role-playing game that I do not play but looks interesting because of the artwork that captured my interest. Then I saw the books and decided to try  one and I was not let down, but pleasantly surprised to read Dan Abnett's  very detailed and colorful characters and world building novel.  I felt  like I was reading a futuristic dirty dozen!  The characters are many and  very well done, better than most action-based sci-fi novels, and the  storyline was actually very good and there were a couple of pleasant  surprises to boot! I love this new universe opened up to me and will read  and review all of them.  I am looking forward to part 2  &quot;GHOSTMAKER&quot; coming out in september.  This is a must read if you  like action sci-fi that is well written. Thanks Dan	2000-06-29
