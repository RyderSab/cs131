I read this book a couple of years ago, and just recently reread it.  What a fascinating story.  For those who are interested in humanitarian crises, and what it takes to make things happen; within the myriad non-governmental organizations and governments as well; this is the book for you. <br />Cuny's CV reads like a laundry list of the disasters (mostly manmade) of our time.  Bosnia and Chechenya are the two most prescient issues in this book.  Anyone who engages in these types of activities in the future would do well to read this book to see what kind of energy and fortitude it takes to get things accomplished. <br />Cuny's demise is a tragic story with an even sadder ending, but I will let the reader get there on his/her own... <br />A joy to read about such a remarkable person.	2005-08-11

However this work taxed my ability to keep the common thread that is woven through the book.  I didn't mind the passage back in time to detail earlier events that had a bearing on Roberto's present circumstances, but the additional element of his \\"twin\\" kept me a bit off balance. <br />I will have to say that the details provided by Eco leave no doubt in your imagination as to what the scene on board the ship must have looked like...remarkable details and descriptions.  And as always, Eco's masterful command of symbology and historical trivia are evident throughout... <br />Well done, but not in on the same level as Pendulum, and the Name of the Rose. <br />	2005-08-03

He has done this for most, but are notably absent on others. <br />However, from what I have seen, this has been the best coverage of the topic bar none.  Well done, and hopefully he will be taking entries for a new revised edition somewhere down the line.	2005-07-11

However, the license taken on the periods of history covered is shaky indeed.    Moreover, the editor probably wanted to get this to print quickly, which accounts for some of the poor writing and errors encountered throughout the book.    I will give the book credit for its enthusiasm in playing up the eccentricities of the various figures covered, but then again, I can pick up a copy of the National Enquirer and get a good dose at a fraction of the cost.  Not for serious historians; moreover, not for anyone interested in good history.  This book is good for a quick, light read, with maximum entertainment value.  My wife is still shaking her head that I actually read the book to its end!	2005-06-30

This is not a deep, intellectual and weighty book. But the idea of pursuing your Personal Legend is interesting, and this theme is well played out in the novel.  If you are interested in a positive, well-intentioned book for some light summertime reading, give it a shot.  If you are looking for the meaning of life in this book, you might want to look elsewhere.	2005-06-25

While there are other better first-hand accounts of the movement of prisoners from Kut to Anatolia, they are all unique based on the author's experiences.   <br />The majority of this book plods from day to day, but an interesting twist develops later in the book which does make for an interesting read (but I will let you determine that yourself.)	2005-06-12

However, once I get past that aspect of the book, wow...what a page turner.  One of the reviewers here wrote \\"Gotterdamerung\\"...absolutely appropriate.  The decline of one of the longest lasting empires is tragic in that the major Byzantine players had, at times,opportunities to reverse the decline, but Byzantine intrigue ruled the day. <br />Particularly today with the movies highlighting the crusades, this volume sheds another light on the Byzantine view of the crusaders, a view which many westerners may be unaware of. <br />The almost anti-climatic fall of Constantinople is a sad footnote in history, but the manner in which Norwich describes it is such a pleasurable read, I would not hesitate to pick this volume up again and reread it some time in the future.  A wonderful story. <br />	2005-05-27

Norwich's masterful use of language adds an extra dimension to what has been previously characterized as poor history.  As I mentioned in my review of Vol I, this is not history for the specialist, but for someone who has a general interest in the history of Byzantium, or for that matter, that of Europe.  This particular volume begins with the rise of Western European christendom -- Charlemagne and the strengthening of the papacy of Rome.  It ends with an interesting story of the Battle of Manzikert--called by many as one of the most important battles in European history--although the details of the actual events are hazy at best. <br />In between these two events we read about the rise and dramatic fall of the Byzantines, and the incredible intrigue and double-dealing of the Byzantine court.   <br />One of my previous criticisms of Vol I remains true here--lack of maps!  With the detail of the battles provided, it surely would be handy to have reference maps to follow the events. <br />The storyline is an excellent page-turner...highly recommended!	2005-04-06

Coll has taken an obviously complex and murky (not to mention the hinderances that security places on his writing)subject and has clearly laid out the evolution of Bin Laden's rise, and how CIA and the US security establishment dealt with the enigma that we now commonly refer to as UBL. <br />Coll's access to senior CIA and Reagan/Bush I/Clinton/Bush II officials provides a stunning level of access to the reader.  I would note (and Coll has published an update after the 9/11 commission published its report and noted in the appendix that much of what he wrote was vindicated by the commission's report) much of what he wrote has been proven to be right on the mark. <br />I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the Pentagon's Special Ops role.  I believe that based on the CIA-centric focus of the book, a bit of inter-governmental sniping is evident, and the Pentagon, which is made out to be a slow-moving, lumbering, obstructionist entity, may in fact have been a more willing player than is laid out in this book.  I would have also like to have seen a comment about the Khobar Towers bombing, and potential links to the UBL issue. <br />His handling of Massoud was right on target, and what he writes of the persona of Massoud can be seen today in the posters that are plastered around Afghanistan of his picture.  A truly larger than life individual who played a central role in the saga of Afhganistan. <br />I read this book in a couple of days...it was that well written, and that much of a page turner.  I can only hope that Coll writes a post-9/11 book that continues where he left off.	2005-02-28

Anyone interested in the Byzantine era would enjoy some of the details woven through the narrative. <br />However, as I encountered in Foucault's Pendululm, there were sections that were a bit over the top for me. <br />Nevertheless, it was a good page turner, and the character of Baudolino was well thought out in my opinion.  Just his tale of how he got to be involved in the whole saga was well thought out...the elusive search for Prester John (and the associated twists and turns) was also very well done. <br />	2005-02-01

In painstaking (sometimes too much) detail, Arkin has compiled a list of code names that run the gamut of the mundane to the extremely sensitive. <br />I concur with Arkin (based on his radio interview on NPR) that classifying something from Americans that is in the open for the rest of the world to see, is irresponsible.  However, I would also have to say that pushing the envelope with some of the issues covered in this book is also not terribly responsible. <br />Does the government need to classify plans/programs/activities --absolutely yes.  Does the government tend to err on the side of overclassification--of course.  <br />Make the determination yourself by reading this book. <br />I am not sure who to attribute this quote to, but in the game of politics in Washington, this may not always necessarily be the case...\\"those who know do not talk, those who talk do not know\\"	2005-02-01

Billy Waugh provides an invaluable history of special operations and CIA clandestine operations from the early 60s to the present.  To think that someone in his mid-70s is still in the thick of things with regard to the global war on terrorism is amazing.   <br />Waugh's book provides some interesting insights into the genesis of America's interest with Usama Bin Laden, and how close we actually were to him in the early years of his rise. <br />However the best background this book provides (aside from his unbelievable 10 years in Vietnam with SOG) is his pursuit and role in the capture of Carlos the Jackal.  A good review of how case work is done.   <br />If you are looking for serious prose, this book is not for you. However, if you are looking for an incredible page-turner written by someone who was intimately involved in many classified operations, buy this book.  Highly recommended!	2004-09-18

Having read this years ago in college, I guess I didnt grasp Lermontov's mastery of imagery.  Pechorin, the main character of this series of novellas, is on the one hand quite a complex character, but yet on the other hand, a prototype of the superfluous man.  I have been told that Pechorin's character is on par with that of Pushkin's Evgeny Onegin, but I haven't read that yet, so I will withhold comment.  However, the humor and drama in this short book will certainly reward the reader.  5 Stars!	2004-09-14

However, a consistent theme, which I never tire of rediscovering is the humor Eco embeds in the narrative.   <br />For those who think they are experts on any given tangent of conspiratorial history, get ready to be immersed in arcana more arcane than you could possibly imagine.  I do have to admit that certain threads of the narrative could make one despair and leave the book...but do not despair, the book is a wonderful read, and reveals more than first meets the eye.

Figures such as Von Hentig, Niedermeyer, Wassmuss, Teague-Jones, Noel, and MacDonnel to name a few, are brought to life and given their rightful spot in the plot-counterplot dramas that unfolded behind the scenes in Mesopotomia, Persia, Afghanistan and Russian/Soviet Central Asia. <br /> I would have liked to see a bit more development on Wassmuss vis-a-vis Mesopotamia, and I think any reader of this would love to see in the future the true life story of Reginald Teague-Jones. <br /> However, the scope of this book is so large, that any further elaboration on any of these subjects would have made the book a multi-volume set. <br /> A great read for anyone who is interested in any of the other theaters of WWI. Excellent bibliography (as usual for Hopkirk)...highly recommended.	2004-07-26

Here Grinyov, and his faithful servant, have an interesting adventure with fellow officers, ruffians and locals. I wont give away the ending, however, the twists and turns keep you turning the pages.  All the while, Grinyov's character remains true to form, upholding the ideals of his upbringing. <br />Fabulous read...and a quick one at that. <br />	2004-07-26

That being said, Lord Carver has written an average history of each campaign. But what is noteworthy for the historian is the incorporation of personal narratives found by Lord Carver, and woven throughout the book. <br />My interest in this book was solely in the Mesopotamian portion of this book. However, I did read the entire book, because I found that the stories were extraordinary glimpses into these actions.  It is one thing to read history, it is another to read eyewitness accounts of the actions.  The book is a bit on the pricey side, but for anyone interested in the Turkish front, this should be a must for your collection	2004-05-12

I wish I had asked their opinion of it prior to reading it.  Not considering myself a subject matter expert, I was hoping for something a bit more substantive.  What I got instead was a book filled with a wandering dialogue, broken up in places by the author's personal conjecture/supposition on unrelated matters.  If I had wanted Cantor's opinion on today's British royal family, or the current state of the Catholic church, I certainly wasnt expecting to get it in here. But you will and more...<BR>While it was readable, the lack of documentation was somewhat annoying to say the least.  I am sure there are other more weighty and well-written tomes on this subject matter.  Dont look here if you want the one-stop shop for the issue.<BR>I cant say that I put the book down not learning something new, because I did--but I felt Cantor's own admonition in the text of other authors' predicament with publish or perish certainly reflected on his own writing here.	2004-04-26

However, if you can look past some of the more untenable issues in the book (I will let you determine what those are), the book has a very quick, action-packed story line. As a matter of fact, it all takes place within the span of a day!  Many of the characters lacked the proper background to make them more realistic/believable. Yet despite these problems, I enjoyed reading the book.  Hopefully Brown can come up with a new formula for his next book, because I think the religious conspiracy issue has been done for now...	2004-04-14

However, this narrative is told from the perspective of the senior Air Force mission commander.  Col Kyle was involved with the planning from just about the beginning and was able to observe, and comment on, the creation of the plan.  Kyle was actually on board the rescue aircraft and was the on-scene commander when the fateful decision(s) was made to abort and the catastrophe that followed.<BR>For those who are interested in the foibles of complex command and control regimes, Kyle has penned quite the case study.  Moreover, many of the problems that surfaced during this mission were studied, solved, and incorporated into standard operating procedures in the future.<BR>While there is a slight bias in the book (you can determine for yourself), you cant get much closer to ground truth than one of the senior planners.  A good story, with an unfortunate ending. Recommended to anyone concerned with leadership and military planning.	2004-03-31

Today the precious commodity is oil, and in light of the demise of the former Soviet Union, a whole new cast of characters are activily engaged in competing for influence and the associated riches that will come with control of the oil resources.<BR>One new facet of this game, that Kleveman highlights is the role multinational oil corporations play in the game. Whether you adhere to many of Kleveman's suggestions that much of what is done in this region is done at Big Oil's behest is subject to debate.  <BR>The book is well written..although I did note some factual errors, particularly with some of the military terminology that he uses.

Description of court life of the Raj under the thumb of the English was excellent.  However, I was very suprised with the actual storyline:  from boyhood privilege to life as a virtual outcast; and how the boy takes hold of his situation and capitalizes on an opportunity to completely remake himself in the image of an Englishman.<BR>Once the boy is able to assume life as a proper Englishman, he finds that what he longs for he can no longer obtain, based on who he has now become!

If you are interested in this type of fiction, I would recommend Umberto Eco's Foucault's Pendulum, which I still reread from time to time.<br />I thought Brown laid a good foundation utilizing Opus Dei as one of the main antagonists in the book, but so much more could have been done developing this facet of the book, and moreover the last few chapters really had me asking for more.<br />Nevertheless, Brown has made a good effort, and if you want a book that you can read over the course of a rainy weekend, then this is one for you.

Yeats-Brown is an upper-class officer in a colonial regiment in India, and his writing style is reminiscent of Sassoon, Manning and Fussell, although not quite on their level.  However, his story of life in a colonial regiment is very familiar to those officers serving in England...the lifestyle (pre WWI) of polo, hunting and life at the mess is very consistent.<br />Where I found this book intriguing is Yeats-Brown's mobilization for WWI.  The book takes interesting turns as he is sent to Europe, then back to Mesopotamia, but not as a Lancer but as an observer for the newly formed Royal Flying Corps.<br />I believe Yeats-Brown has written other books about his captivity with the Turks, but this book has a good narrative of his time as a prisoner in wartime Turkey.<br />THe book concludes with Yeats-Brown discovering the religions of India, and his eagerness to learn their secrets.  Very interesting account of colonial India by someone who was a bit more observant of local customs than the average British officer.<br />Easy to read...highly recommended	2003-09-22

When one steps back and looks at how one man was able to fund the Afghan resistance at a level previously thought untenable, the boldness of the operations clearly comes to light.<BR>While Crile's view of who was on the right side and wrong side of this operation (in CIA and Congress) may have been slightly tainted by some of the larger-than-life characters who are the main players in this narrative, the story is still remarkable.<BR>I would have liked to have seen more to the conclusion than what was presented.  For instance, what hand did the CIA play after the war was over with the still well-funded budget to counter Najibullah's regime.  This budget was a carry over from Wilson's days.  Additionally, what happened to WIlson to force him from politics?  <BR>For those who like gripping storys of the covert world of the CIA and other intelligence organizations, this book is for you.  DOesnt necessarily get into the operational details of how/why, but gives a more broadbrush approach of how Wilson and his CIA counterparts conducted this operation.<BR>Five stars for Crile's book...an enjoyable read.	2003-09-13

From fairly innocuous duty in the Sinai, to a more complex situation in Cyprus and Central America, to the ultimate test for the UN--the Balkans.<BR>Gen Mackenzie's insights also highlight how the UN has adapted (or failed to adapt) to the growing complexities of multinational peacekeeping, in an age where superpower rivalries are no longer able to keep warring factions in check.<br />Worthy of note is the battle Mackenzie faced dealing not only with the warring factions in Bosnia, but also the warring faction's ability to utilize the omnipresent media to shape public opinion.<BR>Mackenzie's story of the beginning of UNPROFOR should be mandatory reading for those attempting to pursue multinational peacekeeping efforts in a complex, multiethnic environment.<br />Good anecdotes, and a very enjoyable read	2003-07-28
US	51295355	R26QY5UIKC5HGE	0385489099	424706370	The Rasputin File	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Interesting, but could use a better editor	Radzinksky certainly had access to some new material which has not been explored, and because of that this book is important. But as some of the previous reviewers have noted, the reader has to wade through the repetetive nature of Radzinsky's story, coupled with some possible translation problems, it does not make for a casual read.<BR>However, if you can overcome these minor nuisances, the book tells an incredible story.  If you do not know much about Rasputin's influence on the Romanov court, this will be an eye-opener.  I was floored by the the level of influence Rasputine had over the Tsarina and in turn the Tsar.  <BR>His death reminds one of a Greek tragedy, but I will let you make the link yourself.  Overall a good story, but poorly edited.	2003-06-17

The book details the rough and tumble political battles that are waged behind the scenes, out of sight from the average American.<BR>From the national political level, who wanted to draw a line in the sand, and was more than  willing to provide input to General Schwartzkopf, to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the JCS, who utilized the strengthened office of the JCS, brought about by Goldwaters-Nichols in 1986 to put Washington's stamp on the Centcom plan...the book does a great job in interviewing all the players at this level who had a hand in formulating policy.<BR>Even  more interesting is the narrative surrounding the actual war planning. From the Air Force's bold plan to affect change through the use of airpower, to the Marine Corps, who wanted a greater role in the invasion of Kuwait, to the US ARmy, who competed against themselves to ensure their respective units had a part in the attack.<BR>A great book, which could perhaps provide insight into what recently happened in Operation IRAQI FREEDOM.  THis will give the non-military reader insight into what General Franks probably encountered when formulating his plan, and all the inputs he had to weigh when making decisions.<BR>This book provides a great counterbalance to the respective service histories of the first Gulf War and a must read for anyone interested in that conflict.	2003-05-18

This small volume documents the trials and tribulations of FIalka and other members of the press corps dealing with the military, which in most respects was wary of the press, based on experiences lingering from Vietnam. <BR>However, Fialka has more criticisms...his own peers in the press share an equal blame in his eyes, based on the way they handled themselves within the press pool, frequently trying to one up the other.  He also criticizes the press organizations who sent reporters with no experience dealing with military matters to cover, what up to this point, was the largest military story since the Vietnam War.<BR>Fialka does have some positive things to say:  his praise for the Marine Corp's ability to handle the press stands in stark contrast to that of the US Army.  He also praises the tenacity of the reporters that bucked the pool system to get the real story, even risking their own lives to do so.<BR>THis book is an interesting read, based on the complete reverse situation recently demonstrated in the 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom.  It would be interesting to see what Fialka would say about his brethren who were embedded, and how that may or may not have contributed to getting the best face on a story.<BR>A quick read, and if you can cut through some of the \\"its not fair\\" dialogue, a good review of press operations during the first Gulf War.	2003-04-30

I have noted previous reviewers stating that it is a listing of one bloody battle after another:  True.  However, Stokesbury gives great explanations as to the &quot;why&quot; behind the staggering loss of life based on the use of pre-WWI tactics, in the face of new weaponry.<BR>If you are looking for detailed accounts of other than the Western and Eastern fronts, then this might not be the book for you, for they are only covered anecdotally.  Yet the coverage for the conflict in the European theaters is great.  <BR>Stokesbury does not give a dry, mundane explanation of the events, but attempts to make the reader see the whole picture and does it in a very easy to understand format.

First volume describes life in the English country, where a young George Sherston becomes completely immersed in fox hunting.  To say he becomes consumed by this is an understatement.  Sassoon's intimate depictions of the countryside, to include the life of a country gentleman are so detailed you can clearly &quot;see&quot; and feel how young George felt.<br />Volume 2, Memoirs of an infantry officer take George into the trenches of France, where again with graphic details, the horror and calamity of the fighting in WWI are brought to our attention.  Of note is the latter part of the volume where Sherston's morals are challenged, and how he deals with this mental dilemma.<br />Volume 3 takes Sherston from the trenches of France, to a stint in Ireland and Palestine, but ultimately back to France where the novel is brilliantly wrapped up. <BR> <BR>Sassoon's experiences in the war have given us perhaps one of the greatest novels from the era.  The writing is absolutely outstanding and will give you pause to put the book down.	2003-02-17

Manning, an Australian who moved to Britain to pursue his writing, served in WWI as an enlisted man, upon which the book is based.  Bourne, the main character, is based upon Manning's experiences in France on the Western Front during WWI.  <BR>The novel provides an interesting insight into the lives of the common man in the trench, based on the perspective of a man who is from the upper class.  Despite the class difference, Bourne is able to befriend his comrades, while at the same time, engage with the NCOs and officers who are senior to him.<BR>An important element to derive from the book is the horror of the trenches, and the commanality of the experiences of the men who served, despite their social status.  Once a man went \\"over the top\\" the base instinct of kill or be killed prevailed.  Manning grasps this concept and adeptly describes the mechanical routine of sending men to their death, in what today is an inconceivable amount of casualties.<BR>If you are looking for a good read on what life is like in the trenches, this is a great book.  <BR>Manning, while not a household name, won the acclaim of writers of his era to include Hemmingway and T.E. Lawrence.  It is an enjoyable read and not easy to put down.	2003-01-17

That being said, from a military leadership perspective, if one has a method, even if it doesnt work, it will continued to be used time and time again.  Curzon's character is a representation of the level of British generalship in WWI. Unyielding, unimaginative, and willing to toe the line at all costs, with the blood and treasure of England.  <BR>The story has a humor woven throughout the narrative.  It looks at Curzon's social climbing, his promotions (through no fault of his own, and his old school belief system.  If it werent for the tradgedy of the hundred of thousands of lives which were expended based on the unimaginative battle techniques, it would be a very humorous story.  Unfortunately, the death toll of WWI is a sobering reminder, thanks to Forester, of the repercussions of Generalship as displayed by Curzon.<BR>HIghly recommended.  An excellent insight into the class structure of the British Army of WWI.	2003-01-13

I have a great deal of interest in the Expeditionary Forces that left from India during WWI, so I thought this would be a welcome addition towards my understanding of operations in British East Africa.  Well to sum it up, it wasnt really.  This book is a very superficial biography of Meinertzhagen, using suprisingly very few sources.  As noted by earlier reviewers, the book is consistently broken up by narratives of the author's own experiences, which may or may not have anything to do with the story at hand.  If you are looking for a serious biography of Meinertzhagen, this is not for you.  If you are looking for a light read with no particular substance, this is it.	2002-12-23

For anyone who has spent time in the Balkans, you can picture the areas he reported the war from, although his picture is likely a bit different than ours.  His stories from the front line, taking into account his meetings with Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Muslims are incredible.<BR>I probably could have lived without his tales of drug-induced stupor during his brief interludes back in London, but despite these brief momements, the book was alive with the fog, horror and brutality of this war.<BR>Also noteworthy was Loyd's brief trip to Grozny, to report on the Russian's first efforts to take the city.  It is interesting how Loyd compares and contrasts the two conflicts.<BR>For anyone interested in the Bosnian conflict, this book will provide an edge to the somewhat dulled historical accounts found in many history books.	2002-10-14

Tennant, RFC (the predecessor to the modern Royal Air Force - RAF) was a commander for Squadron No.30 in the Mesopotamian campaign of WWI.  His story documents the arrival of his unit shortly after the tragic loss of Al Kut by the British to Ottoman forces.  However, the book details that shortly after his arrival, in conjunction with new British leadership, the Brits scored a series of successive victories, capturing Bahgdad, and culminating in the routing of the Ottoman forces in northern Mesopotamia (now Northern Iraq).<br />What is interesting about the book is the conduct of aerial warfare during this time period.  From the fragile nature of the aircraft, the inhospitable weather/climate in Mesopotamia, and the lack of modern technology which we now take for granted, is truly an inspiring story of early air forces in action.  Of note, the comradery displayed by the British pilots to their German/Ottoman pilot foes is truly remarkable.  This type of chivalrous conduct is long gone.  The treatment of pilots in prisoner of war camps is also documented, and I think future readers will look at the treatment of pilots in POW camps and wonder how we got to where we are today.<br />Despite this book being a reprint from a 1920s story, it is an excellent read, and tells an incredible story of a campaign that was considered a sideshow at the time, in the shadow of the horrible war that raged in Europe during this timeframe. An excellent 5 star rating for an excellent story that defies its age.	2002-10-01

But the title, is a bit misleading.  Woodward focuses too much on the Iran-Contra issue (and superficially at that) to the detriment of other CIA and DoD paramilitary/covert activities during the era of the 80s.<br />Furthermore, the way Woodward wove himself into the storyline would lead one to believe that he was a key character in the whole Casey-era saga.  Fortunately, this is hardly the case.<br />Nevertheless, the book is a good review of the key players at the macro-level who were creating policy.  Of note, the interaction between Goldwater and Casey is enlightening.<br />If you really want to get to the meat of CIA/DoD secret activities during this era, Steve Emerson's &quot;Secret Warriors&quot; will provide far more insight into the covert activities of the 80s.	2002-09-18

Ignatieff had some great insights into the diplomacy building up to the Kosovo air campaign (i.e. gaining valuable insight into Holbrooke's shuttle diplomacy), but some of the observations, particularly those in the last chapter beg questioning.<br />The repercussions of a zero casualty conflict will reverberate throughout the US defense establishment for years to come and will certainly set benchmarks, warranted or not for future conflicts.  But sacrifice in battle will be supported by the American public if the situation warrants.  The war in  Afghanistan bears this point out to an extent.<br />The dialogue between Skidelsky and Ignatieff was interesting, as was the return of Ignatieff to Belgrade to meet his longtime friend Aleksa Djilas.  This dialogue portrayed the extent to which people such as Skidelsky and Djilas would like to look past the atrocities committed by the like of Milosevic, at the expense of Western intervention.<br />I rated the book three stars only because I didnt see the common thread throughout the book...merely a series of collected essays that may or may not have had anything to do with the subject \\"virtual war\\".  THe book does add some interesting insight into Holbrooke's dealings with Milosevic, but could have delved more into discussions with Gen Clark and perhaps Lt Gen Mike Short, the Joint Forces AIr Component Commander, on the extent the \\"virtual war\\" was or was not fought both on the battlefield, in the media and in the political realm.	2002-08-16

The individual stories, many of which had never seen the light of of day, are told in a very readable manner.  The individual heroics of the SOG RT personnel and their &quot;Yard&quot; cohorts are stories Hollywood certainly missed the boat on.<BR>Moreover the number of Medal of Honor winners from this unit is remarkable.  But many could argue after reading their stories, that a number of these brave men could have been submitted (and some were) for multiple citations of the nation's highest honor.<BR>While the stories are highly anecdotal, and without footnotes, the storyline overcomes these issues.<BR>Anyone who is interested in military special operations should include this book in their library.	2002-08-09

Today, Emerson has capitalized on this early research and is now in the forefront of documenting terrorism.  It would be interesting to see if he is utilizing many of the sources he obtained while writing this book.<BR>I thought he had excellent sources, and many of these chapters could have been easily expanded into more in-depth stories.  The Iran-Contra mess certainly weighed heavily while writing this book, and unfortunately, Emerson tried to cover the scandal without getting too bogged in that mess...that being said, I don't think he succeeded very well in drawing the ties between IRan-Contra and the organizations he covered so well throughout the book.

Having traveled throughout many of the areas covered by the Kladstrups in this remarkable book, I was captured by the not-often told history of the vineyards during World War II.  While certainly not expecting a weighty academic tome about the French-German parley over the wine business, I certainly enhanced my appetite to learn more about the actual mechanics of the murky business dealings between the German occupiers (many of whom were pre-war acquaintances of the vintners themselves) and the French vintners.<BR>The book is an easy read; and while history has obfuscated the difference between those in the French Resistance, and those who 50 years ex post facto claim to have been part of the Resistance, I believe the Kladstrups made an honest effort to provide a semblance of balance.<BR>But for those of us who love French wine, the stories of how precious stores of vintage wines were hidden from the Nazis are truly remarkable.  I would have loved to have seen a couple of more chapters towards the end of the book, demonstrating how the vineyards got back on their feet, and more importantly, how the pre-war German-French relationships were reestablished.<BR>If you are looking for a good summertime read, this book is for you.

The rare insight into the modern day political infighting of technocrats in Washington is extremely insightful...particularly documenting the risk-averse mentality that seems to have prevailed during the 90's.<BR>Baer's descriptions of his time in Lebanon, and of following terrorism in that region is intriguing.  His tour in Tajikistan mirrors sentiments I have heard from others who have served, or who have lived in Central Asia during the immediate post-Soviet era.<BR>His dialogue on the Kurdish issue does raise questions about the US Iraq policy in a macro sense.  While Baer points to missed opportunities with the Kurds, there are many who believe that within the Iraqi opposition, the Kurds are but one facet of an overarching mosaic.  To strictly focus on the one element in hopes of implementing an Iraq-wide policy is excluding other important elements within Iraq, at the peril of not creating a cohesive opposition for the country as a whole.<BR>Overall, an interesting read.  I would have liked to have seen more on his involvement with the politics of the Clinton administration, which seems to have been his ultimate roadblock.  But in the published literature of ex-CIA personnel, Baer has penned a very readable overview of the growing intransigence of the system in Washington. This will be an important document for historians to reference when looking at the genesis of the US war on terrorism.  A good read, and highly recommended.	2002-05-28

Covering the rise of Constantine the Great through the rise of Charlemagne in the West, Norwich does a very good job of creating a readable story of the confusing nature of alliances and political double dealing that was the essence of the Byzantine Empire. <br />Speaking from a military perspective, I would have like to have seen greater depth in the battles, which shaped the empire (along with some better maps), but I still enjoyed Norwich's humor and ability to create a gripping narrative.<br />If you are looking for something more serious and scholarly, look elsewhere. But if you are looking for an enjoyable history of a complex political dynamic and era, this is the book for you.	2002-03-12

An excellent overview of the geography, religions, linguistic differences, and political development is discussed, which adds considerable understanding to the present situation, and likewise provides insight on how any post-Taleban regime will cope based on these differences.  The historical timeline provided throughout the book, to include a concise timeline in the appendix is invaluable standing by itself.  I did think the book disjointed in places and somewhat difficult to follow, despite my knowledge of the area.  <BR>Magnus had a long career actually working in Afghanistan, and likewise followed this country's political environment after the Soviet invasion: His contacts (as noted in the numerous interviews utilized as sources throughout the book) provide an unusually close to home point of view on a number of issues.<BR>While written prior to the horrific events of 11 Sep 01, Prof Magnus sagely predicted the role Zahir Shah would play in reconstituting any new government in a post-Taleban Afghanistan.

However, after the first chapter, I was hooked.  Bina Kiyonaga has effectively portrayed the difficulties of trying to strike the delicate balance between maintaining a semblance of normalcy for her family, while supporting her husband's career as an officer of the CIA.  Having lived overseas, I can certainly appreciate Bina's problems of having to raise a family without the normality and convenience of life in the United States (not to mention having to raise 5 children in this environment!).<br />While the details surrounding much of what her husband accomplished during his tenure at the CIA will never be disclosed, Bina has done an excellent job of providing background to lend a certain aura to what her husband was all about.  I was awestruck by the devotion she lavished on her husband during good times and in bad.  Her faith and her family certainly allowed her to become the women she is today.  And is portrayed in the book in a very effective manner.<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Despite the minor redundancies throughout the narrative, I think this is a remarkable story...truly something in this book for everyone!	2002-02-25

From the Treaty of Sevres, which offered a glimmer of hope to the Kurds for statehood, to the Treaty of Lausanne, which ultimately marked the end of any Great Power support for statehood aspirations, the book creates a remarkable story.<BR>Following WWI, and with the subsequent jockeying for power in the region following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, McDowall presents a clear pattern of failure by the Kurds to coalesce and create a common front to articulate their views.  Also presented is the similarly clear pattern by the states, which currently have Kurdish populations, to disenfranchise the Kurds and marginalize their political aspirations.<BR>This history covers the fallout from the Coalition war against Iraq (Operation DESERT STORM).  I would love to see a more current version of the book which discusses how the current status quo has refueled Kurdish aspirations for autonomy...likewise I would like to see how recent events in Turkey have affected the Kurdish population of SE Turkey.<BR>A great book for both the casual reader of the history of this volatile region of the world, and for the scholar alike...Highly recommended.

Regardless of what you believe or don't believe, the story is interesting in and of itself.  While a lot of the data could have been gleaned from the countless books and reports written during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, the book certainly has its moments.  I rated the book 3 stars, not because of the claims made against Carew, but because the book as advertised when I bought it (early 2001 in the UK), purported to discuss Carew's operational experience in the Balkans.  If you read the book hoping to see this aspect of his special operations career, you would have been sadly dissapointed.  If Carew has lied about his special operations experience, the story makes for an interesting account nonetheless.	2002-02-01
US	51295355	R3CBTAMMETSNW4	0743205022	444632912	Holy War Inc. Inside the Secret World of Osama Bin Laden	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Timely, insightful, intriguing...	Without a doubt, Peter Bergen ahs written a compelling first-hand accounting of the rise of bin Laden, through his personal interviews with the man.  The timing of the book, while rushed into printing shortly after 11 Sept, is certainly remarkable and serves to provide some much needed insight for the general reader on bin Laden.<BR>Bergen's story, in places, echoes of the tales told by British adventurers to the Afghan region during the \\"Great Game\\" of the 19th Century.  These anecodotal chapters of just actually trying to get to see bin Laden are illuminating in and of themselves.<BR>Unfortunately, because of the timing of the release of the book, the last chapter, which details possible courses of action by the US against bin Laden, was a mere foreshadow of the ability of the ability of the United States (when compelled to action to prosecute such a galvanizing campaign) to hit bin Laden with sufficient force,on the other side of the planet.  I dont think enough credit was given to the US military, especially with virtually the entire court of public opinion behind it.<BR>One of the most striking analogies in the book can also be found in the last chapter--The Assassins from the 11th and 12th centuries.  Once could argue al-Queda is destined for the same fate.  This might have been better placed in a preface or intro chapter with more work done to provide a more in depth comparison.<BR>Overall, an easy to follow book.  Very timely, and Bergen has talked with the right people and has had extraordinary access to key figures in this drama.  The book will be viewed as a one of a kind when history looks back at these events.  The insight and exposure Bergen brought to the table was truly unique.  A great read--highly recommended.	2002-01-27

Gen Clark has given an excellent first-hand account of the internecine politics between the regional warfighting CinC (in this case CINCEUR/SACEUR) and the National Command Authority.  In a day and age of rapidly expanding communications, which allows Washington DC to have insight as it never has before, the regional commanders are increasingly finding the management of public opinion and of the political leadership as difficult as managing the campaign itself.<BR>The insight provided on differences between the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and himself reinforce this dilemma.  <BR>Gen Clark has been a key player in the Balkan military/diplomatic scene since the Bosnian conflict, and its somewhat tenuous resolution at Dayton; culminating with the war in Kosovo.  His personal relationships with many of the leading political figures in the region only add weight to his narrative.<BR>From a strictly military perspective, it would have been interesting to have seen more on his relationships with his senior commanders, but overall, a well written book, which will add yet another dimension to the history of this complex area of Europe	2002-01-17

If you are looking for the fast paced action of Black Hawk Down, I don't think Killing Pablo is at the same level.  Despite this, it is an extremely interesting read.  I thought more could have been developed regarding some of the non-Delta players, particularly the other intel operators and how they fit into the operation (Centra Spike, CIA, etc...)  But for documenting a very elusive and fascinating subject, Bowden has hit the mark once again.	2002-01-13

As an avid reader about the problems, which have plagued the Balkans throughtout the 90s I found the book to be both informative from a personal narrative perspective, but tiresome from the repeated diatribes directed towards those who were not pro-Bosniac.  While little argument can be made against the documented atrocities committed against the city of Sarajevo, no effort was made to look at the Bosnian-Muslim leadership and their role/complicity in the conflict.  For anyone interested in the personal tragedies faced by those who lived in the city while under siege, it is a great story.  Overall though, I thought the book was diminished by the often-repeated diatribes against just about anyone connected with the then-ongoing peace talks (Vance-Owen), or the UNPROFOR mission.	2002-01-13

As a non-Africa specialist, I found the insights interesting from both an historical and anecdotal perspective.  Each chapter in and of itself could have been expanded into a more detailed story, and this is why I did not give it a 5 star rating.  Some of the chapters certainly begged for more.  Nevertheless, if you are looking for a good relaxing and enjoyable story, particularly on Africa, this is the book for you.	2002-01-13
