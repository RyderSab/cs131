Full games are used to illustrate specific points. If enjoy Euwe and Meidens's Chess Master vs. Chess Amateur, let these be your next books on strategy. (I suggest sticking with an author you like.) These are probably most helpful for someone rated between 1600 and 1800 USCF. (Never waste time on chess books that are over your head.) <br /> <br />If you have trouble with the binding, search the web for the books in ChessBase format. They are encrypted, and the key is found in the books themselves. So once you have bought the books, you can read them in ChessBase at no extra charge. <br /> <br />4 stars for the books, plus one for the files.	2005-04-25

West:    \\"Thomas Jefferson regarded John Locke and Algernon Sidney as the two leading sources for the American understanding of the principles of political liberty and the rights of humanity. Locke's Second Treatise is readily available, but since 1805 only one major reprint of Sidney's Discourses has appeared until now. This neglect is as undeserved today as it was when John Adams wrote to Jefferson in 1823:    'I have lately undertaken to read Algernon Sidney on government.... As often as I have read it, ... it now excites fresh wonder that this work has excited so little interest in the literary world.' [Adams recommends this book,] 'as well for the intrinsic merit of the work, as for the proof it brings of the bitter sufferings of the advocates of liberty from that time to this, and to show the slow progress of moral, philosophical, and political illumination in the world...'\\"    That ought to be recommendation enough, but if you wonder why you should read Sidney in addition to (or instead of) Locke, West's foreword is especially enlightening:    \\"Sidney proves to be closer to the Greek and Roman classics than Locke is. It is characteristic that Sidney quotes frequently from the ancients while Locke hardly ever does. But the ancients were not 'classical republicans' in a Machiavelian sense. Their political thought always began or ended with the individual human being, not in the sense of an isolated unit, but as a being oriented by human nature to a life in accord  with reason. [West then identifies] \\"particular illustrations of this broad difference between Sidney and Locke\\".    It is unlikely that you have heard of either Robert Filmer or his book, \\"Patriarcha\\" [published in 1680, though written in 1630], a defense of the rights of kings, as it is unlikely that you live under the rule of a king. However, as often happens in the history of ideas, the ideas themselves have not died, but are rather re-outfitted in different costumes. Sidney's point-by-point rebuttal to Filmer is therefore as relevant today as it ever was.	2004-11-15

In his own words, \\"I hope to convince computational scientists having experience with Perl that Python is a preferable alternative, especially for large long-term projects.\\" <br /> <br />He has certainly done a creditable job. As an expert in computational differential equations, he neglects neither efficiency nor correctness, while stressing both simplicity and reliability. In this sense, he has done a great service to the Python community. <br /> <br />The question is: What justifies the purchase of his book? <br />The answer is: Chapters 4, 9, and 10. <br /> <br />Contents: <br /> <br />1. Introduction--26pp <br />Very convincing arguments. <br /> <br />2. Getting Started With Python Scripting--38pp <br />Interesting examples. <br /> <br />3. Basic Python--56pp <br />A too-quick tutorial. Go to python dot org instead. <br /> <br />4. Numerical Computing in Python--48pp <br />Stellar explanations of vectorized array operations. <br /> <br />5. Combining Python with Fortran, C, and C++--36pp <br />Details use of Fortran2Py and SWIG. Mentions many alternatives. <br /> <br />6. Introduction to GUI Programming--70pp <br />Useful examples of Tkinter/pmw widgets. <br /> <br />7. Web Interfaces and CGI Programming--24pp <br />Good source of ideas. <br /> <br />8. Advanced Python--132pp <br />Deep and extensive. Includes: option parsing, regular expressions, data persistence and compression, object-oriented programming, exceptions, generic programming, efficiency. <br /> <br />9. Fortran Programming with NumPy Arrays--32pp <br />All about efficiency and re-use. <br /> <br />10. C and C++ Programming with NumPy Arrays--40pp <br />More about efficiency. NumPy C API, C++ objects, and SCXX. <br /> <br />11. More Advanced GUI Programming--73pp <br />Tedious discussion of both Web and standalone GUIs. BLT, canvas, cgi. <br /> <br />12. Tools and Examples--70pp <br />Excellent examples of PDE solvers, with a powerful GUI, but quite long and tedious. <br /> <br />A. Setting up the Required Software Environment--16pp <br />Wonderfully specific installation instructions! <br /> <br />B. Elements of Software Engineering--50pp <br />Python's strength! Very practical advice on modularity, documentation, coding style, regression-testing, version-control. <br /> <br /> <br />Strengths: <br />+ Downloadable py4cs package, esp. numpytools module <br />+ Great advice everywhere, e.g. CGI checklist, Pythonic programming, and trouble-shooting. <br />+ Concrete evidence for most assertions. <br />+ Very attractive presentation. Sturdy, high-quality cover, binding and pages. Brief, elegant code fragments (except in Chapter 12). Readable prose. No wasted space. <br />+ Available as 5MB pdf file, after purchase of hardcopy. Very nice. <br />+ Slides, installation instructions, and errata also at web site. Very professional. <br /> <br /> <br />My peeves: <br />- Not enough tables to be a useful manual. <br />- On p.428(#7) he points out that handling a raised exception is very slow. However, when I time his example with a positive argument, the try-except version is 20% faster (b/c the if clause is skipped), so he is actually giving bad advice for the general case. Luckily, he contradicts himself later, on page 685: \\"Exceptions should be used instead of if-else tests.\\" The best advice: Avoid common exceptions in inner loops. <br />- The 10-page index is not as great as it at first seems. (See Martelli's Python in a Nutshell for a better one.) <br />- Pure interface functions should 'raise NotImplementedError', rather than 'return'. <br />- Exceptions should never be trapped mindlessly with 'except:'. That would hide your own SyntaxErrors! <br />- Too many exercises. (It's published asa textbook.) Since there are no answers, the exercises are useless for non-students. (See Lutz's Learning Python for effective exercises with answers.) <br /> <br /> <br />Overall rating: <br />This contains the best information on numerical programming in Python that I've seen. Though expensive, it could easily be your only Python book, given the excellent online documenation already available.	2004-10-14

I have a mind of my own, and I like authors who treat the reader with respect. If I wanted religion, I would go to church. I want to be convinced.    In particular, I am very skeptical of the whole big bang idea. I've been exposed to some of the evidence, but it has always seemed relatively scant to me.    No longer. Seife has convinced me. The big bang, basically, probably, did in fact occur.    His deep respect for skeptical scientists, my heroes, runs through the whole book. Seife acknoledges that much of the old evidence was really not overwhelming. When he refers to very recent experiments which disprove moribund but reasonable ideas (some of which have occurred even to laymen like me) he does not criticize the scientists who had held out hope. Actually, he seems to admire the tenacity of the iconoclast.    The icing on the cake is the list of ongoing and future experiments. This section may soon be outdated, but for now it has the effect of including the reader in the scientific pursuit. I am now very excited to learn the results of some of these experiments, though they may be years away.    If you just want to admire the insights, go with Hawking. If you want to dream, try Brian Greene. If you want to be dragged kicking and screaming into the new cosmological era, read this book.    Why only 4 stars? The book becomes less convincing in the final chapters. But it is the best I've found.	2004-07-25

The most informative debate is Lomborg's point-by-point rebuttal of criticism which appeared in Scientific American. (You can find all of this on the web.) In a nutshell, the scientists do not sound very scientific.<br />I think there is a reason for the disgust of many scientists. Lomborg attacks the evidence of several kinds of environmental catastrophe. The scientists, on the other hand, begin from a conservative point of view in their concern for the mere possibility of irreparable damage to the earth. They are obviously correct to realize that we cannot afford to lose the earth, and we should therefore be wary of any significant perturbation made by mankind.<br />I believe that the scientists get angry because Lomborg refutes their favorite arguments in favor of strict environmental policies, those which purport that a catastrophe has already begun. Lomborg, on the other hand, does not understand that the strongest argument is that we can always be wrong.<br />We cannot afford a mistake which destroys our only viable planet, which is why we must limit the global impact of our activities. But this is not the point addresed by either Lomborg or his critics.<br />Lomborg has done a significant service in pointing out some flaws and biases in scientific research, but you would learn more by following the debates than by reading this large, tendentious book.	2004-07-14

The question is whether it is worth the price, given the free online HTML reference documentation.    Pros:  + Very good index; somewhat better than the online index.  + Helpful explanations.  + Some examples.  + Much more advice than the online docs.  + Very nice typesetting.    Cons (1st edition):  - Does not cover some of the most useful (new) modules: timeit, logging, zipimport, itertools, sets, sum, heapq.  - In particular, I would love to have ADVICE on how to use logging effectively.  - DOES cover the dead (insecure) modules rexec and Bastion.    So take your own decision. Personally, I would say it's not essential, but still worth the price. I go back and forth between the online index and this book.    Addendum:    The 2nd edition covers most of Python2.5.  (The 1st covered 2.2 and much of 2.3).  It includes most useful modules and excludes the deprecated ones, so it actually adds much more info than its slight increase in page-count would indicate.  The only thing I was not able to find was 'meta_path', which is at least mentioned as highly technical.    In general, the 2nd edition is for a more expert user than the 1st.  The explanations sometimes include some dense code:    * There is a long example of using meta-classes.  * The explanation of the new try/except/finally assumes that you understand the old (broken) behavior.  * The 'with' statement is explained by way of an equivalent fragment of code.    These changes make the 2nd edition ideal for the practicing Python programmer.  However, a novice might be intimidated.    I would now increase the rating to 5 stars if I could.  Excellent reference work!	2004-03-08

I could easily give this book 5 stars, but I try to use the entire rating scale.]<br />This book is the best available complement to the free HTML documentation (which is available online, or on CD in many books, including this one). I like the latest version of the Welch book, with its vastly improved index, but I find the explanations to be a bit sparse. <br />For example, I am an experienced programmer in several languages, but I still had a lot of questions about local scoping vis-a-vis namespaces after reading Welch and the docs. Flynt made this topic transparent, with diagrams and examples. I also liked his example of building a tree data structure, which demonstrated to me better than anything that Tcl is simply the wrong language for building trees.<br />That brings me to what I dislike about this book. The code examples are sometimes too long. In my opinion, long code should be only on the CD, to save paper space. And as the book is shorter than Welch's latest, I think the space should not have been wasted.<br />About 1/3 of the book is devoted to Tk, similar to Welch. I have no interest in Tk anymore, so that is all a waste for me. (If you ARE interested in Tk, Effective Tcl/Tk programming is a great source.)<br />There is a fair amount of info on the C library, but I think that Ousterhout's old book is still the best place for that. However, Flynt provides great advice on practical ways of interfacing with C/C++ (SWIG, Starkits, Starpacks).<br />He also details the pro and cons of  various Tcl tools, some free. This sort of information goes out of date quickly. For example, the author already mentioned privately to a friend that &quot;nagelfar&quot; is now his own favorite syntax checker. But at the moment, most of his info is current.<br />In short, this is the best book for Tcl developers. But please consider Lua as an alternative interfacing language.	2004-02-20

It is an alternative to Silman's Reassess Your Chess Workbook. Many people love the Silman books. Personally, I think they make you feel as if you can play much better than you really can.<br />This book, through its ratings (and according to the authors you must complete all exercises before you get an accurate rating) can give you a realistic idea of your strategic skills. But the authors note that a good plan may be subverted by tactics.<br />In the preface the authors reveal their aim of writing a book which is both enjoyable AND instructive. They do this by keeping the reader involved, as if interacting with a chess coach. I think they do a fair job at both tasks, and that is high praise for a chess book.<br />I think that in the first few chapters they do a better job than Silman -- or nearly anyone else -- of explaining the elements of strategy. The main problem is that they bounce around amongst seven different games to show their points. You need a computer (or 7 chess boards) to follow along closely.<br />Anyway, the tests are the meat of the book. As I have not gotten far, I'll withhold my opinion and promise to finish this review later. For now, I suggest reading Silman's other book, The Amateur's Mind, then turning to this book to see what you've learned. Then I would skip How To Reassess Your Chess Workbook, though the HTRYC textbook might still be interesting eventually.	2004-02-17

Some are versus the GM, and some against slightly better or slightly worse players. That makes these games useful for coaching sessions.<br />You'll get coached on every phase of the game. It's all very useful information, and not over the heads of advanced beginners.<br />The worst thing about this book is its length. It is short, about 100 over-sized but sparsely used pages. I highly recommend it at the used-book price.	2004-02-07

I don't see how it's worth twenty dollars.<br />It's full of large-print, pithy advice. Sometimes, the advice is quoted from a well-known master, and those few quotations are easily the best parts of the book.<br />Normally, there are 2 of these per page, but sometimes (at chapter boundaries) none. <br />The last several pages do not even have this much. Instead, they show diagrams of many different openings, with a brief comment. Typically, the diagrams show only a single move; sometimes 2 or 3. I have no idea how this could be valuable to anyone.<br />I would say one star, but I save that for truly horrible books. This book exudes quality in its pages, its binding, its printing, etc. All the advice that I read (and you can read the whole thing standing at the bookstore) was sound, but none of it was supported by example. (Well, maybe a few rare examples.) It does not actually require any thinking by the reader. It is similar to some pretty pop philosophy gift-books I've seen in the bargain bins.<br />I think the book would be most valuable for a chess coach to clip the pages and pin them to a bulletin board. It has absolutely no other value. The author and publisher are certifiably insane if they imagine someone could learn from this.<br />Addendum:<BR>I have learned that several quotations are wrongly attributed. This poor research turns a 2-star book into a 1-star book. Avoid.	2004-01-14

Its advice on using databases for self-improvement is sound and reasonable. It might be useful to somebody who has no idea whatsoever how to use a Chess database.<br />I think there are better, easier, cheaper ways to learn. On the other hand, a database can be expensive. This is a small additional price to help you make the most of your investment.<br />Why only 2 stars? There is too much fluff and filler. A book on chess software should not have so many single-position diagrams for study. Those diagrams might have been more useful if we knew the games they came from. Then we could pull them up in our handy-dandy database. <br />The authors completely overlook what is by far the most valuable training software, from Convekta. In fact, tactics training is given short shrift, even though it is arguably the best reason for using a computer to study chess.<br />Most of what is in this book is fairly obvious. The advice is available in paragraphs -- and sometimes full chapters -- in many other chess books. I would expect a full-length book to be detailed and comprehensive. There are definitely things I could learn about using chess databases, but not here.	2004-01-14

It will NOT make you a strong player (you need to do tons of tactics problems for that) but it will give you a thorough understanding of what chess is about.<br />What's great about the book is that it is replete with WORDS! Imagine that: A chess book with words in it. What a novel concept.<br />There are words to describe everything. But it is not a dry, pictureless read. There are also diagrams with arrows, diagrams with X's, partial-board diagrams, sets of successive-move diagrams, and standard single-position diagrams from named historical games. <br />Don't worry. It's not a kid's book with nothing but diagrams and arrows. The moves are given in standard algebraic notation, and some have normal annotations.<br />Basically, if you consider yourself an intelligent adult, but you would like to understand this game better, buy this book. To find something more accessible to a non-chess player, you'd have to look to Edward Lasker and his old descriptive-notation books.<br />But please note: This is NOT for serious players. It teaches you the intellectual side of chess. It gives you the full vocabulary to sound as if you know what you are talking about -- not just the rules (which are explained extremely well with the arrows etc.) but also the tactical motifs, the openings, and the strategic concepts. However, it does not develop your talent. It is like a book on tennis: To get better, you need more than an intellectual understanding; you have to play the game, or at least practice exercises.	2004-01-02

It explains not only the rules, but also the goals of the game, with small examples and plenty of diagrams.<br />The book starts on the basic rules, with special rules like &quot;castling&quot; and &quot;en passant&quot; given their own pages. There are also basic tactics, basic checkmate patterns, and basic endgames.<br />Capablanca believed that the endgame must be taught first, and Emms here does a good job of explaining how to seal the victory. I've found that to be the most important part of chess for a beginner to learn. (I'm talking about King + 2 Rooks v. a lone King, for example, or King + Queen v. King.) It gives him confidence that he can actually win a game. It reinforces the legal movement of the pieces. And it is simple enough to be fully understood.<br />I highly recommend the first half of the book to a complete novice.<br />The second half is very practical and could interest even an intermediate player. It goes into standard openings and tricky combinations. This material would be very challenging for a beginner, but something special about the book makes it more accessible, something which also appears in my favorite chess book, Chernev &amp; Reinfeld's 'Winning Chess' (and, in a way, 'Bobby Fischer Teaches Chess'): There are often two diagrams per example.<br />I'll explain what I mean. Typical children's books have colorful arrows in an attempt to show movement. I guess that's not bad, but it can be distracting and condescending to an adult. The Chernev method was to show a diagram of the example, and another diagram midway through the combination. That enables an intermediate player like me to visualize a difficult combination completely.<br />Emms uses this technique extensively in the final section on combinations and occasionally in the sections on openings. This makes the second half of the book much less intimidating to a beginner. The lines and simple variations are still shown under the diagrams in Algebraic Notation, so nothing is lost. Throughout the rest of the book, there is often a diagram showing the very next move, which is the same idea at a beginner level.<br />So I recommend the second half to a beginner who is curious about the magic that chess has to offer. This should last a novice several months.<br />'Concise' is not the best description of this book. It is not the lessons which are truncated (as in some purported tutorial books like 'Master Chess in 21 Days') but rather the book itself. It is a small square book. At 288 pages, it should be considered a 144 page pocketbook. However, the space is generally well-occupied, so it is somewhat like a 288 page Pandolfini book (which may have lots of whitespace and filler text). It may be over-priced for its content compared with the classics, but its readability makes up for this.<br />This is a big review for a little book, so I'll stop here.e still shown under the diagrams in Algebraic Notation, so nothing is lost.

This book does not replace an endgame manual, not even at the beginner level. You could, for example, read Pandolfini's Endgame Course in its entirety and still get some value from this book. It is not complete.<br />It is simply fun. Seirawan explains the ideas in words. He throws in anecdotes, tension, and humor. He goes over some of the basics in excruciating detail (for example, King+Bishop+Knight v. King, which is extremely rare in practice). He includes complete master-level endings so that you can see how it's done. His discussion of rook endings (extremely common in practice) is helpful. He finishes with a very interesting chapter on the difference between grandmaster play and the theoretically perfect moves in computer generated tablebases.<br />Another enthralling re-print in the Winning Chess series.

I normally do not like openings manuals, but if you must have one, this is a better choice than MCO. In fact, it is a cross between MCO and a typical Schiller openings encyclopedia. It has very convenient, full-page tables of suggested moves for each opening discussed, and the discussions include ideas, variations, and sample games.<br />The advice is aimed at club players, which is something I like very much, as opposed to NCO (or even MCO) which contains best lines for masters.<br />The openings here are not all off-the-wall gambits, although many of those are included. Fairly standard and common open games are here too -- the Spanish Exchange, for example. This is really a book for combatting offbeat LINES of various openings. If your opponent has memorized some sharp lines which could give you trouble, you will have to memorize your responses.<br />The aim of this book is to keep the memorization to a minimum. Ordinarily, normal moves are sufficient. This book is your defense against a \\"weaker\\" opponent who is attempting to win points simply by memorizing.<br />The best thing about the book is the use of ! and ? in the tables. They actually include some common blunders and refutations, unlike most such tables which list only \\"best\\" play. The idea is to suggest lines which you can play with reasonable confidence as a club player, and to point out the likely pitfalls for both sides, in a very easy-to-use format.<br />This is not a repertoire book, and it is not a way to learn to play open games. It is strictly a quick-reference for playing against those annoying club-level opponents who are determined to concentrate on surprises in the opening rather than on improving their own games.<br />If this were on CD (in Chessbase or PGN) instead of in a book, I would give it 4 stars.	2003-12-08

It's great for beginners wondering why they can't get through the opening without getting crushed. Purdy's Guide provides dozens of rules of thumb. Follow these, and you'll usually get at least beyond the opening.<br />He also has some middlegame and endgame tips, in addition to lots of small examples. Purdy's prose is fluid and disarming, neither condescending nor placating, <br />The downside to these rules of thumb? Purdy does not explain in much depth why violating these rules can hurt your game. But for a beginner, does the reason matter? You'll enjoy the game more if you follow the principles.<br />I suggest reading this book before going on to Seirawan's wonderful and personally genuine Winning Chess series. Seirawan concentrates on piece mobility and tactics more than on general principles.<br />There are more reviews under an older edition, sub-titled &quot;First Steps to Fine Points&quot;.	2003-12-05

It does not teach the rules. It is for a beginner looing to improve.<br />This was once a fair book amongst those available (certainly better than most of Reinfeld's rushed pot-boilers). But not anymore. It's very wordy, maybe too wordy. On the plus side, refutations of bad moves are often mentioned. But that doesn't make up for the plain-jane presentation.<br />For a similar book, try any of the following:<br />Purdy: Guide to Good Chess<br />Seirawan: Play Winning Chess<br />Capablanca: Chess Fundamentals<br />Idiot's Guide to Chess<br />Chess for Dummies<br />If you like Horowitz (and note that most of his old books are in Descriptive Notation) then look for this used.

They are not the ones normally found in best-game collections. Only one of the 20 verbosely annotated games appears in the Mammoth Book of the World's Best Games (and only 3 of the lightly annotated supplemental games) and none are in Chernev's Twelve Best.<br />The reason for this is that these games contain subtle, high-level errors. The point is to watch the 2 great defensive players, Lasker and Petrosian, recover from their mistakes.<br />It is clearly a quality, well-written book, but I think you need to be at least 1700 to get much out of these games, though the annotations are full of verbal description. Defensive moves are just harder to understand than vicious attacks, and much less fun. Still, Crouch has produced another worthy addition to nearly any chess library.	2003-11-13

For example, all 10 of Alekhine's section are in 'Alekhine's Best Games', and only 4 of Capablanca's were not in 'Capablanca's Best Games' (and 3 of those are in 'The Unknown Capablanca'). And of course, there is some overlap with 'The Mammoth Book of The Greatest Games of Chess' and other such books.<br />So if you already have several collections, you probably do not need this book.<br />If you don't (yet) own several collections, then you would be happier with something else by Chernev. Beginners can learn much from 'Logical Chess Move By Move', and intermediate players would find more value in 'Most Instructive Chess Games of All Time'. The games in 'Twelve' can be quite subtle in their exactness, which is not very instructive.<br />Still, this is easily a 5-star book. So who would enjoy it? If you're interested in the question, &quot;Who's the best player ever?&quot;, then you'll enjoy going through this collection of 12 of the top candidates.<br />Read in that frame of mind, this book is a joy, a sort of Tournament of the Century. If only it were a Top 20, instead of a Top 12! Missing are Reshevsky, Keres, Fine, Euwe, Reti, Steinitz, Anderssen, Morphy, and of course anybody after the publication date of the book.<br />[By the way, the break-down of games by each player provided by another reviewer only accounts for wins.]	2003-11-12

He is exactly right.<br />Without getting too political, I will just say that the practice, particularly at the graduate level, of studying alternative theories rather than analyzing a given theory critically is characteristic of &quot;the dismal science&quot;. Evidence and reason seldom persuade an economist, at least a macro-economist.<br />Here, Hazlitt dissects Keynes' General Theory paragraph by paragraph. He does not merely dispute a few conclusions of Keynes; he dismantles a highly regarded work of scholarship. It is unfathomable that anyone could read this book and still view Keynes in a positive light. If the General Theory is a classic of economic literature, then this is an anti-classic.<br />Hazlitt, as a former editor of the Wall Street Journal, writes in highly readable prose, making this book accessible, though not essential, to anyone with an interest in economics, despite the complexity of some of the ideas. It should be required reading for an advanced degree.	2003-10-27

However, it is not so good for beginners.<br />The best thing about the book are the descriptions of plans for various openings, and typical traps. So this is a very good book for trying new openings.<br />The 2nd edition has more current info on computers, but that section is really unnecessary anyway.<br />The rest of the book has decent material, enough to last you quite awhile, but nothing that will give you any epiphanies. <br />By the way, the companion (still out-of-print as of October 2003) games collection, Mammoth Book of the World's Greatest Chess Games, is a truly excellent book for intermediate players.	2003-10-03

Normally, I would not recommend a modern master's game collection to beginners. The moves are just too counter-intuitive to be instructive. However, Seirawan does an incredibly brilliant job of explaining, in words, the ideas behind the openings, the strategies in the middlegames, and the traps and tactics throughout.    The biggest oversight of this book is the absence of a listing of the games. (The table of contents is useless, although the extensive index may have some value.) So here are the games. You could print this out and paste it over the table of contents:    Game 1 (Making History) *  Fischer v. Spassky  1972 World Championship (6) - Reykjavik  Queen's Gambit Declined  1-0    Game 2 (Slaying the Dragon) *  Karpov v. Korchnoi  1974 FIDE Candidates Final (2)  Sicilian Dragon  1-0    Game 3 (Sparkling Originality) *  Ljubojevic v. Andersson  1976 Hoovgoven Tournament - Wijk ann Zee  Sicilian Defense, Scheveningen Variation  1-0    Game 4 (Time-Trouble Misery)  Korchnoi v. Karpov  1976 FIDE Championship (17) - Baguio City  Nimzo-Indian Defense  0-1    Game 5 (A Sunny Moment)  Seirawan v. Karpov  1982 Phillips and Drew (game 11)  Queen Gambit Declined, Tartakower-Makogonov-Bondarevsky Var.  1-0    Game 6 (Olympian Effort)  Korchnoi v. Kasparov  1982 Lucerne Chess Olympiad  Modern Benoni A64  0-1    Game 7 (Experienced Hands)  Smyslov v. Ribli  1983 London (match 5)  QGD Tarrasch Defense D42  1-0    Game 8 (Supreme Effort) *  Beliavsky v. Nunn  1985 Hoovgoven - Wijk aan Zee  King's Indian Defense, Saemisch Var. E81  0-1    Game 9 (Moscow Miracle) *  Karpov v. Kasparov  1985 (game 16) - Moscow  Sicilian Defense B44  0-1    Game 10 ('A la Morphy)  Seirawan v. Timman  1990 KRO, Hilversum (game 5)  1-0    Game 11 (Lightning and Thunder)  Kasparov v. Karpov  1990 FIDE Championship (20) - Lyon  Ruy Lopez Zaitsev C92  1-0    Game 12 (A Rapid Coup)*  Ivanchuk v. Yusupov  1991 FIDESime-Finals Match (9) - Brussels  King's Indian Defense, Fianchetto Var. E67  0-1    (* Indicates a game which also appears in The Mammoth Book of the World's (100) Greatest Chess Games, just to show what other GMs think of these \\"brilliancies\\". That book is for more advanced players, over 1600 USCF I think. Of course, Game 11 is deeply annotated in Seirawan's Five Crowns match book.)    In the postscript, Seirawan mentions that he'd actually annotated 6 more games but had no room for them. That's very disappointing, as this style of explanation mixed with annotation is rare and valuable. The move-by-move analysis is at a level about mid-way (maybe 1350 USCF) between Chernev's Logical Chess and Nunn's Understanding Chess. But if you have already passed the 1400 USCF level (and do not own the Mammoth games collection) add this to your library. The sometimes deep variations, including analysis from named grandmasters, would satisfy a much stronger player. And a weaker player, down to about 1200, would enjoy reading the text of this book if he ignored all the variations.    All in all, easily one of the top 10 chess books in print. Thank goodness it's back in print!	2003-10-02

And unlike an ordinary chessbook, this is one you actually READ, as opposed to study. The ratio of words to game annotations is unusually high.<br />What's really great about the book is the number of relatively obscure players who receive attention. Fischer, Lasker, and Steinitz receive the most, but 45 other players get their own separate sections, in addition to the Italian School theorists and the 7 Pleiades of Germany.<br />Paulsen gets a much-deserved section as a player far ahead of his time and typically overlooked in chess history. Writes Fauber, \\"The tragegy of Paulsen is that only the players who went beyond his successors ever understood him. His play has such a contemporary feel that it is hard to appreciate what a true pioneer he was.\\"<br />The two noteworthy omissions, Bronstein and Tal, are perhaps forgivable, if not laudable, for those players have popular, excellent, and readily available autobiographies. (Sorceror's Apprentice & Life and Games of Mikhail Tal.) However, there are no GAMES of Bronstein's, and only a non-tactical loss for Tal.<br />There are many players mentioned in passing, and though there are no post-Fischer games, there is at least a chapter discussing the three K's, plus Polgar, up-and-comers, and the damned computer itself.<br />With this coverage, Fauber dovetails nicely with Saidy's March of Chess Ideas, which concentrates on mid to late 20th century players and has full chapters on both Tal and Bronstein. Also, Saidy goes into more depth on the smaller number of players covered. I recommend buying BOTH books, if you can find them.<br />Euwe's Development of Chess Style, which concentrates on playing style rather than on biography, provides an interesting comparison. You would not regret purchasing all 3 books.<br />Back to Fauber.... There is a complete index of players and their opponents. There is also an index of openings, which serves mainly to demonstrate the wide coverage of the book as the annotations are not thorough enough to make this a useful treatise on openings. (Get Dumont's 500 Master Games if that's what you want.)<br />There are over 200 games, many well-known. I did not find the annotations particularly enlightening, aside from the simple threats mentioned in many of the games of the first half of the book, and I doubt that a stronger player would see much value in them either. But the primary aim, according to Fauber in his introduction, is not instruction, but rather, \\"to spotlight the major players and their contributions to chess. Games have been included that attempt to portray the style, [and] the personal touch which goes with the greatness, of the players. Sometimes, though, a game has found entrance because it is pretty, and the readers will enjoy it.

Amateur-Amateur games are laughable. Amateur-Master games are the most instructive, and the hardest to find.<br />I have read, and I firmly believe, that you learn most from playing against someone just a bit above your own level, along with post-game analysis and advice from a master-level coach. But that can be expensive. So I think your best bet is to study games between a master and player who is just a bit better than you are. <br />That's where this book is perfect! Silman plays against several different students , all beginning from the same position (often derived from a grandmaster game). He lists their respective ratings, so you can find the one closest to you.<br />There are only a handful of other books which show Amateur-Master games (Chess Master v. Chess Amateur, a great book in old-style Descriptive Notation; Grandmaster Meets Chess Amateur; Improving Annotator by Heisman; any Paul Morphy collection; and simul. games as in Unknown Capablanca or Alekhine in Europe or the Americas) and they typically do not tell the rating of the Amateur or his thought process.<br />Silman records the player's comments for each move, then adds his own. You learn exactly what you've been doing wrong, and you learn it in the best possible way: from somebody ELSE's mistakes!<br />I could go on and on about this book, but I'll just say this: If you're over 1300 USCF, buy this book and study the games by the player just above you. Return to it everytime your rating rises 200 points. Believe me; it will (if you keep practicing tactics).	2003-09-16

Hallman traveled the world with his chess-addicted compatriot, meeting chess players wherever he could find them and chronicling their experiences.<br />I love chess, but I play Shuffle Chess (aka Fischerandom) so that I will never become a chess zombie. Some of the stories here are really sad, but still funny!<br />The biggest drawback of the book is Hallman's &quot;obsession&quot; with the skin color of his buddy, a highly skilled chess player who happens to be black. He is constantly worried about the reactions of people they encounter. Why would a Nobel prize-winning mathematician give a hoot about someone's race? (I know. There is no Nobel prize in Mathematics, since Nobel's wife left him for a mathematician. Hallman runs into the ghost of John Nash, who won in economics.) When Hallman concentrates on the personalities, or lack thereof, instead of on his own paranoia, his observations are very witty.<br />All of this is interwoven with some interesting history of the game: the origins, the evolution of the movements of the pieces, the etymology of their names, etc. I highly recommend this book, especially to anyone who spends his Saturdays memorizing opening variations of the Sicilian Najdorf. (If you think that's pronounced the way it's spelled, you're not yet fully addicted. There's hope for you.)	2003-09-16

Actually, this is a brand new book.<br />Pandolfini uses the socratic method to show an improving player (but not a complete novice) how to become a decent player.<br />The book is very similar to Best Lessons of a Chess Coach (for which Pandolfini wrote the foreword) but at a lower level. I'd say this one is suited to E and D class players, around 1150-1350 USCF (whereas Best Lessons is for more like 1350+ or so). <br />I think that you would improve quicker with Pandolfini's other, more visual books (and I STILL use those for drilling) but this book is painless and fairly entertaining -- and very inexpensive for its size.	2003-09-16

The principal variations given in the solutions are not obvious. They just aren't. I'm about 1500, and this book is way over my head.<br />It SEEMS extremely useful. The typesetting and layout are very easy on the eyes. Repeating the puzzle with the answer is helpful, not a waste of space. The English is cogent. The Summaries of Imbalances given with most answers are comprehensible and instructive. But the lines which prove the answers are simply too subtle for a Class C player to understand.<br />The last part, \\"self-annotations\\", asks you to annotate games on your own, and then to compare your annotations to Silman's. In effect, this part amounts to a set of wordily-annotated games with plans and observations instead of deep variations. It is like an advanced version of Chernev's classic, Logical Chess Move by Move. I think this is a great way to get better at chess, for an advanced student.<br />I am not sure whether it is essential to read Reassess Your Chess first. Silman himself has said that he always preferred Nimzowitch's Chess Praxis (book of exemplary games) to the didactic My System. I think that wordier books sometimes make a player feel as if he is learning more than he really is. But Reassess Your Chess is certainly an enjoyable read.<br />At any rate, before the workbook I recommend a book by Bellin and Ponzetto, Test Your Positional Chess, which provides several choices for each position and (unlike Chris Ward's It's Your Move [blue]) explains the reasons for and against each move. It also gives you a rating at the end of the tests.<br />You might return to HTRYC and the Workbook after you've accumulated a few hundred more rating points.	2003-09-16

Read Am's Mind 1st!	Silman is an excellent instructor, and this book is very, very good. However, just as Silman himself has said that he always preferred the practical examples in Nimzowitch's Chess Praxis to the didactic My System, I prefer Silman's Workbook to his explanations in HTRYC.<br />But then comes the problem: The Workbook is too advanced for a Class C player like me.<br />I would modify Silman's own recommended order of reading his books to this:<br />+ Below 1500 USCF, read the 1st section of HTRYC, or any other elementary endgames book. (Silman's out-of-print endings book is great, if you can find it.) And STUDY TACTICS!<BR>+ At 1350, read Chris Ward's It's Your Move Improvers [red book].<BR>+ At 1500, you might pick up Silman's book on strategy from A to Z, or something similar. (Winning Chess Strategies by Seirawan and Silman, Better Chess for Average Players, Chernev's Most Instructive Games, etc.)<BR>+ At 1600, read the Amateur's Mind.<BR>+ At 1650, try Test Your Positional Chess, by Bellin and Ponzetto, to see your strengths and weaknesses<BR>+ At 1700, read a middlegame book. Pachman, Euwe, or Reshevsky. Maybe even Soltis, Nimzovitch, or Fine.<BR>+ At 1750, take a look at Dan Heisman's Improving Annotator.<BR>+ At 1800, try the single-position problems in his Workbook, including variations.<BR>+ At 1850, read HTRYC. You'll probably have Eureka moments at this point.<BR>+ At 1900, do the self-annotations in the Workbook. It's tough to improve past 1900, and self-annotations are a practical way.<BR>+ At 2000, ... You're not likely to get much past 2000 without clinically obsessive behavior.<br />If you see this book in the store and it appeals to you, buy it, of course! But in case you haven't seen it, I'm warning you that this book is a much tougher read than the reviews make it sound.   Unless you are at least an advanced-intermediate player, you will not be nearly as pleased to open this book as you will with The Amateur's Mind.<br />Just my opinion. Some beginners LOVE this book.<br />By the way, Silman suggests a quick scan for insufficiently protected pieces before strategic considerations. That's not only important for avoiding blunders, but also for saving time. If everything is well-protected, then there simply are no tactics.<br />And a rule of thumb: Think tactics on your OWN time; think strategy on your OPPONENT'S time.	2003-09-16

I agree with the reviews here, but they say nothing about the contents. If you're thinking of ordering it used, you'll want to know what's in it.<br />The lessons are arranged in some logical order, by the frequency with which a given pattern is seen is practical play, as well as in order of necessity, according to the authors. Later combinations use tactics described earlier in the book.<br />For each lesson, the authors explain the basic idea, then they show you a dozen or so examples. What's great about this book is that each combination includes TWO diagrams. The subtitle of the book is &quot;How to See Three Moves Ahead&quot;, and the 2 diagrams are what make this possible. Without the extra diagram, it would be difficult for a player rated around 1200-1400 USCF, the target audience, to visualize the entire combination. These are not, afterall, just simple tactics. They are &quot;combinations&quot; of tactics, and they can be pretty difficult to spot. But because of the extra diagram, you have a real chance of solving the tactic from the 2nd one, and then you can compare that position to the initial one to see what was necessary for the combo. This is just incredibly helpful. Your pattern recognition grows by leaps and bounds.<br />At the end of each lesson is a quiz with for problems. These are always much easier than the earlier examples, so they really just make you feel good. The way to convince yourself that you know what you're doing is to re-read the whole book, which is a joy anyway.<br />After the lessons you'll find a bunch of elementary checkmate patterns, which you can run through quickly several times to pound them into your brain. Then there are some relatively simple checkmates. I'm not sure why they're there, but they don't hurt. Then there are some examples of how to AVOID tactics, called &quot;The Manly Art of Self-Defense&quot;.<br />Then there are 6 fully annotate tactical games with sundry openings. The winners are Chernev, Nimzovich, Berlin, Marshall, Sargeant, and Reinfeld. Only 6, but they're fun games.<br />Finally, no index. Just the answers to the simple quizzes.<br />It's all in Descriptive Notation, which is explained at the beginning, along with a few bits of advice.<br />The chapters are:<br />The Pin<BR>The Knight Fork<BR>Double Attack<BR>Discovered Attack<BR>Double Check<BR>The Overworked Piece<BR>Removing the Guard<BR>No Retreat<BR>The Skewer<BR>Queening<BR>The Vulnerable First Rank (Isn't this the most common?)<BR>Breaking Communication<BR>The Surprise Move<br />Combined Operations (the most difficult chapter)<br />Then Design for Checkmate, The Manly Art of Self-Defense, and Illustrative Games.<br />So there you have it: The contents of my favorite chess book of all time, and I own nearly a hundred.

The purpose of this book is similar to that of 'Mastering Chess' (in 21 days, by Kopec et al.) with a similar audience and similar deficiencies. I think it's best for players from 1300 to 1500 USCF, and it might be a fair review up to 1700.<br />First, I like the notation in this book. Basically, it's Algebraic Notation (eg Nf3), as opposed to the older Descriptive Notation (KN-B3), but Curry adds the original position when he refers to prior moves. &quot;White just played Q/d1-b3.&quot; He uses the slash (/) when he refers to the position of a piece, and I find that helpful.<br />Curry's section on openings is weak. He lists the first 6-10 standard book moves for several dozen openings, but he does not describe their themes and goals (with a few exceptions). I don't see any value in this. However, he makes up for this by supplying a simple opening system for White, the &quot;Curry Opening&quot;. It's similar to the Torre Attack and has much in common with both the Colle and London Systems. He does a much better job of describing the goals of this system than Seirawan does for the Barcza Opening in 'Winning Chess Openings'. And he includes 10 (unannotated) games to show typical play. It's a practical approach.<br />While his middlegame advice is hardly more than review and summary, his sections on the endgame are very useful. He explains some common endings. He demonstrates endgame tactics to watch for. And he provides four examples of typical endgames from actual games. Short but sweet. You will learn something here, but you will wish for more.<br />The best part of the book, and the only reason I'm recommending it at all, is the series of &quot;Cover-Up&quot; games. In these you cover up the moves and try to play one side of the board. In particular, I like the ones in the section on Attacking the King. In fact, I like that whole section, and I highly recommend studying the game fragments there closely.<br />Unfortunately, most of these &quot;Cover-Up&quot; gamesonly assign points for good moves, rather than explaining bad ones or commenting on plans. There are only about half a dozen games with actual comments, so it is not a great value for the money.<br />The main problem with this book, as with 'Mastering Chess', is that the advice will not stick with anyone who does not already understand it. And there is a lot of it. The book is dense with wise verbiage and short on evidence. I don't think that's the way to teach.<br />The sections on tactics and combinations are even weaker than in Mastering Chess as the number of exercises is much smaller. And this leads to the main reason why I hesitate to recommend this book at any price: Curry puts way too much emphasis on the openings and fails to stress the importance of learning tactics. He mentions tactical study several times, but he never explains that you simply will not improve without speeding up your tactical pattern recognition. Most chapters have a few exercises at the end--too few. Curry gives the impression that you can learn chess by reading words on a page, and that's simply not so.<br />If you enjoy what Curry calls &quot;Solitaire chess&quot; (ie guessing the moves for one side of the board and being graded) but would like some explanation for the moves, I suggest you take a look at the 'How Good Is Your Chess' books (one by King, one by Barden). Those are bargain values, and I think your chess would improve measurably.	2003-07-27

It's simply fascinating. Did Morphy really anticipate Steinitz? Did masters understand the \\"principle of early development\\" even before Morphy? Shibut has many interesting things to say about the evolution of chess, with reference to games and history for support. It's a fairly scholarly work, but not a dry one. I think a club-level chess player could learn a bit about chess from this book, while enjoying the lessons of history.<br />The meat of the book lies in the chapters comparing Morphy to a)Anderssen and the romantics, b)Steinitz, c)Barnes, who scored more points off him than anyone, and d)modern players (via Reti's assessments). Here you will find dozens of Morphy games with an unusual sort of annotation. Shibut does not give us many lines of variations, though he does sometimes point out tactical shots. More often, he assesses the postions qualitatively, showing us the sorts of plans that Morphy used. He also includes a great many references to the specific ideas and refutations of other authors, often pointing out THEIR mistakes. All of this gives you a sense that Morphy was both far ahead of his time in opening theory, and competitive with anyone alive today tactically.<br />The games in these chapters are (mainly) real struggles, rather than the dashing brilliancies we are used to seeing from Morphy. Shibut explains, \\"The effect of such presentations in countless beginner's texts has been to reduce Morphy's games to a collection of fables. Their moral is understood to be something about developing pieces, or the evils of chasing pawns in the opening. Whatever the pedagogical value of such portrayals, the games, so presented, can't help but appear shallow compared to modern grandmaster warfare.\\" Shibut wants to show us what Morphy was really capable of when tested.<br />Then there is a fun chapter on Morphy's blunders, showing him to be fallible afterall. And there are examinations of his opening and endgame knowledge.After that comes a complete compilation, hundreds of complete (but completely un-annotated) Morphy games. This might be the most useless part of the book, since you could get at least sparse annotation from Sargeant.<br />One thing this book is great for is the section on games at odds. It amounts to a treatise on how to play such games, analyzing various opening strategies. If you want to play an odds game (eg remove the f-pawn before the game) against a much weaker opponent, I suggest that you take a look.<br />There are essays on Morphy by Steinitz, Znosko-Borovsky, and Alekhine. And finally, Shibut provides several indices: Morphy's openings, his opponents, and games not involving Morphy. However, there is no subject index, nor endnotes on sources.<br />After reading this book, I began to wonder how Morphy would fare against Fischer in a King's Gambit, each at their peak. Clearly, his chess was far deeper than I'd imagined.<br />One drawback: Although the notation is algebraic, it lacks capture (x) and check (+) symbols. This makes it very difficult to follow without a board.	2003-07-27

The purpose of this book is similar to that of 'Mastering Chess' (in 21 days, by Kopec et al.) with a similar audience and similar deficiencies. I think it's best for players from 1300 to 1500 USCF, and it might be a fair review up to 1700.<br />First, I like the notation in this book. Basically, it's Algebraic Notation (eg Nf3), as opposed to the older Descriptive Notation (KN-B3), but Curry adds the original position when he refers to prior moves. &quot;White just played Q/d1-b3.&quot; He uses the slash (/) when he refers to the position of a piece, and I find that helpful.<br />Curry's section on openings is weak. He lists the first 6-10 standard book moves for several dozen openings, but he does not describe their themes and goals (with a few exceptions). I don't see any value in this. However, he makes up for this by supplying a simple opening system for White, the &quot;Curry Opening&quot;. It's similar to the Torre Attack and has much in common with both the Colle and London Systems. He does a much better job of describing the goals of this system than Seirawan does for the Barcza Opening in 'Winning Chess Openings'. And he includes 10 (unannotated) games to show typical play. It's a practical approach.<br />While his middlegame advice is hardly more than review and summary, his sections on the endgame are very useful. He explains some common endings. He demonstrates endgame tactics to watch for. And he provides four examples of typical endgames from actual games. Short but sweet. You will learn something here, but you will wish for more.<br />The best part of the book, and the only reason I'm recommending it at all, is the series of &quot;Cover-Up&quot; games.

What greater recommendation do you need?<br />But beware. This book is not for sub-master players. You might still enjoy it, but following along will be challenging.<br />Strangely, there are tons of diagrams, nearly 500 for only 24 games. Normally, I would expect lots of diagrams for a beginner's book, but this is for advanced players. Well, it turns out that the diagrams ALWAYS go with the move immediately preceding, not necessarily the bold-faced game move. Seirawan has diagrammed the variations! Once you get used to this, it's actually a great boon. It means that a player advanced enough to understand the variations can read this book without a board.<br />However, I am only about 1500, and I simply cannot follow Mr. Seirawan without a chess board. I'm not sure I can follow him at all. The variations are much more extensive than in his Winning Chess Brilliancies, which I highly recommend to intermediate players.<br />Do not buy this book to learn chess strategy. You won't. Buy it for the dramatic history of the match. Buy it to have some fun seeing the relative strengths and weaknesses of these 2 great players. Buy it for serious study. And buy my copy from me, because it's way over my head.	2003-07-24

Note: This is a re-translation of a book also known as &quot;Chess Struggle in Practice&quot;. This Dover book is in Algebraic Notation; the older McKay translation is in Descriptive. (The original book is Russian.) The older book has a different translator and includes a nice intro by Max Euwe. Otherwise, this newer Dover book is just as good.<br />It's appropriate to early-intermediate players if they are willing to skip the comments on openings. The middlegame strategies are amazingly well explained. Advanced players will appreciate the discussions of the King's- and Nimzo-Indian Defenses.<br />Possibly one of the 10 best chess books ever. For the price and number of pages, it's an absolute bargain.<br />Drawback: Even though it's Algebraic Notation, it's not quite standard. There are no &quot;x&quot;s for captures. And it's in a type-writer font. If you're not comfortable with this, you might prefer the latest version of Reshevsky's Art of Positional Play, with an attractive layout and similar required skill level.<br />And I suggest that you read Chernev's Logical Chess and Michael Stean's Simple Chess before you tackle this book.	2003-07-23

It's really a pretty good book. It consists of 100 pieces of advice, each with at least 1 chess position for amplification.<br />At least, that was Pandolfini's intent. However, I think that the pages with just words (which accounts for half the total) are TOO wordy and unnecessary. And the headline (the &quot;ailment&quot;) for each one makes the solution to the diagrammed position a bit less challenging than it otherwise would be.<br />But these are minor quibbles. It's easy enough to skip the text. The puzzles are quite interesting if they are at your level. What level? Well, I estimate about 1250-1350, and you absolutely must have read a simple endgame book first. (Pandolfini's Endgame Course is perfect preparation, but anything that covers King + Pawn v. King will do.) And be comfortable with simple tactics as well.<br />With just that much preparation, you can get a lot out of this book. It will build on your knowledge. For example, if you understand a few fundamental endgame positions, then you'll see why it makes sense to aim for, or avoid, such an ending via trades. <br />I suggest that you read this book out of order. Start with Section 2, continue through 3 and 4, and finally return to Section 1 on Openings, easily the most advanced part of the book with the longest analyses and most subtle explanations.<br />On the whole, the book is worth reading. Unfortunately, the price is rather high for only 100 simple puzzles. So look for it used. It's not a bad gift though.	2003-07-14

Before criticizing a book by Pandolfini, it's important to understand the intended audience. The majority of his books are meant for people who have played no more than a handful of chess games. That explains the many negative reviews he receives.<br />In contrast this book, one of Pandolfini's most advanced, is aimed at players around 1350-1450. Consisting of 50 articles culled from his old chess magazine column, it has some very useful explanation and illustration of the sort of strategic ideas that players of this strength seek, with a depth of analysis that is shallow enough for these players to follow without a board. (I'm about 1500, and this book is just a bit too simple for me. By the way, I was about 1200 at the start of the year, so I do know what I'm talking about when I suggest how beginners can improve.)<br />Personally, I'd skip the early sections. The \\"Fundamentals\\" are not fundamental; they're simple pieces of advice you've already heard. The part on \\"Openings\\" is somewhat esoteric compared with the rest of the book, although I loved what Pandolfini had to say about the Four Knights Game, that ubiquitous and boring closed game which beginners wander into blindly. And there are far better sources of information on \\"Tactics\\" than what you'll find here.<br />The true value of the book begins with the section on positional ideas. This is worth studying. Then continue to the end, through the sections on middlegame strategic concepts, endgame themes, and planning.<br />As for prerequisites, you'll need to be fairly adept at tactics and possess strategic knowledge at the level of Chernev's Logical Chess Move by Move.<br />It is evidently difficult to bridge the gap between simple aphorisms for beginners and the complex positional understanding of veteran club players, so I give this book 4 stars for a noteworthy effort.	2003-07-14

You can learn a lot of chess with this book, and if you honestly grade and time yourself, you'll get a realistic picture of where you stand.<br />These puzzles are not easy. They take about 5 minutes each, and you'll have to put in that much time if you want your rating to be indicated accurately. This is NOT for tactics training, even though you will learn from it. You need to be VERY GOOD at tactics before you attempt these; otherwise, you'll get NOTHING correct. You'd be wise to go through Lev Alburt's Chess Training Pocket Book at least once before tackling these.<br />If you're 1500, you could start this book, but don't rush through it. Do one 8-problem test per week and monitor your progress through the year. (There are 56 tests.)<br />Each test is prefaced with the sort of tactics you will be looking for, and some of the puzzles are very similar within a test. This is intentional. The authors want you to LEARN, but without making things too obvious.<br />I have noticed minor typos in the answers, but no actual errors, which is quite rare for a puzzle book. The font, diagram size, printing, and layout are all excellent. The original games are named in the answers, rather than in the problems, to avoid distraction. Remember: These tests are timed!<br />Highly recommended. But if you're below 1500 USCF, caveat emptor! You don't want to ruin the future value of this book by cheating and looking at all the answers now!	2003-07-14

(Dover Chess)	Books	5	18	18	N	N	A very effective book	When I look over a grandmaster game, I don't ask, &quot;Why'd he do that?&quot; Anybody can wave his hands and answer something incontrovertible like, &quot;This move supports the piece on x and prepares for an attack.&quot; How helpful is that?<br />Instead, I ask, &quot;Why didn't he do this other move?&quot; This book makes an effort to answer that question for moves in about 20 master games of the 1990s.<br />The format is simple and consistent. After each move by the losing side, you are asked to choose your own move. Then you are graded. You get an amount of credit proportional to the strength of your move. If it's a blunder, that is often pointed out as well.<br />This helps you to learn from your own mistakes. It's far more instructive than most books of annotated games. It's simpler than Nunn's move-by-move book, deeper than Chernev's, and more like actually playing a game since you are only thinking about the moves made by one side.<br />In a way, the book is similar to Chris Ward's 'It's Your Move', but vastly superior, as this book discusses more alternative moves and far more positions. (Ward's 'Improvers' version, however, is quite good.)<br />Highly recommend for anyone with a rating between 1500-1700. I have no idea how accurate the rating predictions of the book are, but who cares?	2003-07-07

The book is not bad. It is certainly appropriate for the audience named in the intro (1450-1750 USCF). The problem is that it's all either too easy or too hard to learn from.<br />What I mean is that the lessons are either rudimentary reviews or terse introductions. Though the book is not formatted this way, it's really a series of very brief problems. If you have seen the problem before, it's a review. If you haven't, there is not enough information for you to get it from the book, so you'll have to work at it on your own. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is not what I'd call instructive.<br />There is a lot of information squeezed into 133 pages. The book is certainly not a waste of money. I think it's most appropriate to someone who was quite proficient several years ago, maybe even a tournament player, and recently returned to the game. If that describes you, this book might remind you of a lot of what you used to know. <br />For me, however, the book is a disappointment. The fonts, the lay-outs, the diagrams, the binding, the organization--it all feels as if it should be very enjoyable. But for each section I've attempted, I've glided past the problems with which I am already familiar and quickly become mired in details that are over my head.<br />Similarly, while the book is filled with a great deal of wisdom, very little of it is convincingly demonstrated for the skeptical.<br />The main benefits to me were in the 36 combinations exercises (few of which I was able to solve without turning to the solutions) and the 26 endgame problems (which were admittedly somewhat instructive).<br />I recommend Better Chess for Average Players instead of this book. Or if you're not yet ready for club-level play, try something much simpler, like Ron Curry's Win at Chess. And consider the Mammoth Book of Chess.	2003-06-18

NCO has text only in the introductions to each group of openings, and not much there. Modern Chess Openings (MCO-13), on the other hand, often explains in words why a line is good or bad. (e.g. \\"White's advanced pawn is compensation for the material.\\")<br />Beyond that, I prefer MCO-13 to NCO (as well as to MCO-14, ECO, BCO, etc.) because I am simply not good enough to take advantage of recent theoretical weaknesses found in older lines. Most players go nuts trying to keep up with the latest theory. Why? If la Bourdonnais, Morphy, and Steinitz could not find a refutation for a move, what makes you think that you can do it under time pressure?<br />I would actually prefer an even older reference for precisely this reason. However, MCO-13 was the first in Algebraic Notation (AN). That's strictly a matter of taste.<br />I am not a fan of openings books, but if you must have something, a used copy of MCO-13 is all you need for reference--maybe even more than you need. Add Burgess's extraordinarily well-organized Quickest Chess Victories of All Time as a reference on traps, and still you are saving money.<br />The main value of an up-to-date reference book like this is in following recent high-level games. It's fun to notice when Kasparov steps out of theory, especially against a computer. For that purpose, and that purpose only, this is a 5-star book. But if that's your purpose, buy some good software. You are wasting your money on this book.	2003-06-18

Golombek's annotations are easy to understand.<br />A true chess connoisseur will prefer this to Reinfeld's 'Immortal Games of Capablanca'. A less obsessive person on a budget will prefer the less expensive alternative.<br />If you don't have Capa in your library, you do not play chess.<br />Addendum:<br />John Nunn writes in his introduction, \\"... one has the impression of strategic plans effortlessly consummated. This strong stylistic feature makes Capablanca a particularly good subject for Golombek's style of annotation, which eschews detailed analysis. Intricate variations would only obscure the overriding principles...\\"<br />What's funny is that Golombek writes in his preface, \\"This simplicity of pefection was the product of supreme art. Playing through a Capablanca game and fully understanding it after close study constitutes a liberal education in the art of chess. For this reason I have found it necessary to annotate the games as exhaustively as was within my powers.\\"<br />Well, Nunn is a Grandmaster, so his standards may be very high!<br />At any rate, Golombek's annotations are certainly much more thorough than Reinfeld's, but they are still textual, not deep in variations, and easily understood by anyone who has read a chess book before.<br />If you can afford it, make this Capablanca collection your choice.	2003-06-06

Just flip it open, look at the diagram, and figure out the best move. Typically, the opponent has just played a horrible move which allows you to decimate his forces immediately.<br />Why is this useful? Can you use these ideas to ensnare your own opponents? Probably not, and that's not smart chess anyway. This book is useful primarily for improving your pattern recognition of the various attacking motifs in the opening -- SO THAT YOU CAN AVOID THEM!<br />Sure, if you play another novice, it can be fun to look for ways to induce him into one of these blunders, but eventually, as your opposition improves, you will become frustrated at falling into these same traps yourself.<br />After you spend some time on this book, you will begin to notice when your opponent can fork your pieces, or win material with a sudden check by his Queen, etc.<br />Pandolfini's commentary is sometimes helpful as advice on avoiding the traps, and it is always enthusiastic.<br />Though the others are good too, this book is the best of Pandolfini's trap books for beginners. These are all dual-king pawn openings (1.e4 e5) which typically produce the highly tactical games that beginners can learn the most from. The traps are comprehensible but not obvious for beginners. And the format here is somehow the most pleasing.<br />Only 4 stars b/c of errata, but the errors do not really get in the way.	2003-06-02

The title is not quite accurate. This is really a book of opening traps. The explanations are not nearly so helpful as the traps themselves.<br />Unfortunately, this book is not nearly so useful as Pandolfini's other trap books. As another reviewer stated, the traps here are categorized by the winning move, e.g. Bxf7 or Qh5. That makes the book useless for drilling tactics, as the winning move is already named in boldface at the top of the page. Also, the diagrams do not always follow the blunder immediately.<br />However, this book has the broadest coverage of the three, with maybe 25% non-king pawn openings. Perhaps you could cut out the pages and clip off the headings, then go through these in random order.<br />Definitely read the Traps and Zaps books first. I find this one valuable in improving my pattern recognition still further, as I can go through several examples of a single motif in one sitting, but you might consider skipping this one altogether nd going straight to the deeper traps in Chernev's wonderful Winning Chess Traps, then on to Burgess's Quickest Chess Victories of All Time.<br />This book seems to have fewer errors than the others, so I give it 4 stars.	2003-06-02

It's fun, interesting, and sometimes enthralling. The book can be hard to put down.<br />This does not enable you to beat offbeat openings. That requires years of experience. There is no magic pill. A better player will usually beat you from an inferior position. A master will beat you even if he gives you odds (a free move or a missing piece). This book helps you to compete with players at your own level who are tyring to get an easy victory by surprising you.<br />Most openings have only about half-a-column of information. Some have several pages, with one or two complete games for illustration. This is not the place to learn a repertoire. It's a place to gain some confidence that you can equalize early.<br />It's also a place to get some ideas. Why not throw an offbeat opening at your friends now and then? &quot;All openings are playable by non-masters,&quot; sayeth a wise man. Have some fun. Create some very strange-looking positions.<br />As long as you aren't hoping to win in the opening, but only to get through it, this is a very good book.<br />And it is the ONLY book by Schiller about which the opposite could not be said. Most of his books are riddled with errors, outlined with deceptively useless disorganization, ladden with overwhelming quantities of data, and marred with occasionally suspicious analysis. This book is the opposite in every way. Some people give the credit to Watson's contribution to the annotations, but I think Schiller simply spent more time on this one. His other books show hints of utility but fail in the details.<br />The point is this: Don't let Schiller's other books deter you from buying this one. It really is a decent book. 3 1/2 stars.	2003-05-18

A couple end in remarkable draws. Most finish with the inevitable threat of checkmate.<br />FEATURES<br />+ Digestible format. Each game looks like its own chapter, though it's only 2-3 pages. The brevity of the comments, the lightness of the annotations, and the shortness of the games all conspire to induce even a rank beginner into taking a bite. It's very easy to play out a single game when you find yourself with a few minutes to spare.<br />+ Breadth of coverage. Although this book is no-one's first choice for studying the openings, it certainly provides a convenient introduction. The games are grouped by opening, roughly in the order of their chronological popularity. The first half is dominated by open games, especially the King's Gambit and Ruy Lopez. In the middle, there are several of the French, the Sicilian, the Caro-Kann, and the Queen's Gambit. Finally, there are samples of modern openings, like the KID and English. There is no index; there wouldn't be a point.<br />+ Reinfeld's descriptions. They're brief, but they make the games interesting. He tells you what to watch for in plain English.<br />+ Useful, brief, understandable annotations. Typical chess annotations are of the form \\"instead of this move, which leads to this series of moves\\" and end with a position that is not obviously winning for either side. These are inscrutable to beginners. Reinfeld, however, only provides that sort of annotation when the result is decisive. Often, he instead lists the threats. In other words, he tells us what would happen if the next player skipped his turn. This is exactly what the beginner wants to know. He can think for a minute, \\"OK. So how would I counter that threat?\\" Then he can see the next move and understand why it was made.<br />DRAWBACKS?<br />OK. There are many ways to criticize this book. For example:<br />\\"Many of these games are against duffers!\\"<br />A: Yes, and often the master is hampered by considerable disadvantages (a blindfold, a simultaneous exhibition, a piece removed before the game even starts, or a free move for the opponent) which tend to level the playing field. Because the games are not nail-bitingly close, a beginner can understand the moves.<br />\\"There are too many mistakes in these games.\\"<br />A: It is very useful to the beginner to see how to take advantage of mistakes. Most here are subtle, rather than outright blunders like leaving a piece en prise (attacked and undefended), but Reinfeld's verbal explanations are clear and cogent. Sometimes there is an obvious mistake, but only when the position is already lost.<br />\\"These games are all available elsewhere, in books and computer databases.\\"<br />A: Yes, because they are classics. If they were lengthy struggles, I might recommend a computer or deep annotations, but not for such decisive games. Just watch and learn.<br />\\"The moves are in Descriptive Notation.\\"<br />A: This is really not a problem when the analysis is so shallow. DN is fine for re-playing games (as well as for tactics puzzles, where NxN is actually easier to grasp than Nxf3). Don't be dissuaded by this.<br />\\"There is only 1 diagram per game. A beginner book should not require a board.\\"<br />A: For one of these quick games, one diagram is almost too much. It mainly serves to remind you that you are reading a chess book! Well, it also reassures the beginner that he is following the moves correctly. Yes, this book requires a board. I enjoy moving the pieces and imagining that I am one of the great masters. I peek at the end to see which side wins, and I play his pieces, trying to guess the moves.<br />\\"It's very difficult to guess the master's move following a diagram.\\"<br />A: True. Since the strong moves which follow the diagrams are far from obvious, this book is not useful for tactical drills. The purpose is toinspire. However, it is possible to look for the crushing blow near the end.<br />TRUST ME!<br />With these objections swept aside, there is much to love in this treasure trove. I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Once you know the rules and have lost a few games, you are ready for this book, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.ever, it is possible to look for the crushing blow near the end.<br />TRUST ME!<br />With these objections swept aside, there is much to love in this treasure trove.

Just a cross-reference, so that more people will be exposed to this great book.<BR>-----------------------------------------------------<BR>Original review:<br />OK. If I had to pick one chess reference book, it would be an opening encyclopedia (probably Nunn's) but this is the best in a different way. It's a book to refer to while you're trying to learn openings.<br />Many authors have suggested that the way to study an opening is first to walk through the main lines, then to play out some sample games to understand the themes and goals, then to learn the traps, and finally (if ever) to study the variations.<br />This book is the best reference for traps. In fact, it is the only satisfactory one, and for its uniqueness it deserves the MVB award.<br />There are a few other useful books of traps (Chernev's especially) but this one has advantages that set it apart:<br />* Volume -- Over 2000 short games are included, not one over 13 moves. These are tournament games, mostly from this century, so the mistakes made are not the sorts of blunders you will find in Internet blitz chess, but rather subtle errors that you could easily make yourself. (Burgess mentions an interesting exception, noting that the old penalty for an illegal move was a king move, which forced horrible positions and often resignation.)<br />* Breadth -- All reasonable openings are covered, including a few games for some dubious flank openings.<br />* Ease of use -- The table of contents lists openings by name. The index is by move order. (There is no index of games or players, but who cares?) If you're studying a given opening, you go to that chapter. If you're studying a particular variation, you find the page in the index. For each variation, there is at least one complete game plus branches for other games within it.<br />* Reliability -- Burgess went to great lengths, according to his introduction, to ensure that moves which receive question marks are truly mistakes and suggested alternatives arereasonable.<br />* Insight -- The notes are excellent. Each chapter has a brief summary of the odds of an opening's difficulty. Transposing move-orders are usually mentioned. Some games have little anecdotes or historical connections. Whenever a game is resigned for less-than-obvious reasons (as most of these are) Burgess explains the mate threat or material loss to us patzers succinctly and precisely.<br />This is really a book of how NOT to play openings. It will complement any repertoire books and opening encyclopediae. I highly recommend it for your shelf, even to intermediate players (like me). You might find it entertaining. You will find it useful.	2003-05-16
US	49179982	R1X0116D7Y09SU	0679140379	261558622	Winning Chess Traps	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Essential book for studying any opening.	This is a great book, with 300 traps, mostly 10-15 move games, though likely continuations are sometimes given beyond 20 moves. <br />You can use this book in several different ways.<br />A) Play through the games. They are much easier to understand than modern grandmaster games. In this way, it's similar to Reinfeld's Great Short Games of the Chess Masters, another great book. You'll see tactics in motion, and you can learn as if by osmosis.<br />B) Use the diagrams as tactics drills. Each diagram represents the state of the game immediately following a blunder (marked in the game by \\"?\\"). Look for the refutation. Great practice! In this way, it is similar to the Pandolfini trap books, but Chernev's traps are typically a bit more subtle.<br />C) When learning a new opening variation, look it up in this book first to see the simplest traps. Then to see deeper traps, look it up in Burgess's Quickest Chess Victories of All Time, another great book. The two books have very little overlap, surprisingly. I sometimes copy a line from one to the other.<br />Strengths:<BR>* Well-indexed (similar to Burgess above). Table of contents lists major openings. Alphabetical index lists openings and a fair number of variations. Move index allows you to look up games based on the first 2-3 moves.<BR>* Correspondence between diagram and moves is obvious. (Some books make you scratch your head to figure out which move was just played.)<BR>* Wide audience. Advanced-beginner level, but even a master must be prepared for the traps in his own openings.<BR>* Text explanation next to diagrams.<BR>* One trap per page.<BR>* Excellent use of fonts for different types of info.<BR>* Footnoted light annotation, rather than in-line clutter.<BR>* Broad coverage, not just king-pawn openings. Pandolfini covers only a handful of queen-pawn openings in The Winning Way. Here, Chernev has 89, plus a few other tries.<BR>* Blunders for both sides of the board. Some authors concentrate on White's point-of-view. Here, Black wins about a third of the games.<br />Weaknesses:<BR>* Diagrams are old-style, but at least they are dark enough. (Some old re-prints are way too light.)<BR>* Usually, the diagram is at a logical location, either following the blunder, or one move later when the blunder was really tough to notice. But sometimes the diagram precedes the blunder, which can be annoying when you're just doing tactical drills.<BR>* Descriptive notation, a minor weakness for this sort of book.<br />Overall, it's hard to improve. A really great book.	2003-05-16
US	49179982	R2Y9T62KKDEG98	1857441362	616228114	Modern Chess Self-Tutor	Books	3	16	24	N	N	Fun writing; not much tutoring	Bronstein's words are pure joy to read. If that's what you're looking for, then this book may be for you, especially as most of the older books in this style are out of print. <br />However, I am not sure that anyone can learn much about chess from this book. He takes a paragraph, or even a page, to say what could be said in five words.<br />The games do not really illustrate his points. More often, they are simply sources of amusement, as when Petrosian blundered away his queen in a winning position while Bronstein had only 30 seconds left for 10 moves! Petrosian had plenty of time, but until he left his queen hanging he could find nothing better than to shuffle his rooks aimlessly while Bronstein let his knight bounce back and forth safely. Fortunately for us, translator Ken Neat added the actual moves; otherwise, we would have only Bronstein's description to go by.<br />Of course, not all the games contain such amusing mistakes. More often, Bronstein shows us positions which are interesting for a startling, somewhat tactical move overlooked by the opponent. So the games themselves are quite interesting.<br />And the prose is undeniably compelling:<br />&quot;... every player believes that with the help of imagination and knowledge, tenacity and steadfastness, boldness and caution, sooner or later he will enter the headquarters of the opposing king and will be fortunate enough to utter the sacred words 'check and mate'.&quot;<br />But the words are not actually instructive. Sure, Bronstein has a way of bringing attention to an easily overlooked strategic element of a position. He also provides much advice, as in his section on the opening. (He advocates the Evans Gambit for amateurs.) But more often he simply gives a voice to the chess pieces, as if they could think. <br />Bronstein reminds me of Feynman writing on physics. You love to listen to him. You think you've been bequeathed a rich trove of wisdom. But when you sit down at your desk, you realize that you cannot actually apply any of what you thought you'd understood.<br />You may very well enjoy reading this book. Just do not expect to learn from it. <br />For real chess instruction, try his Zurich annotations.	2003-05-10
US	49179982	R39EJVA52OLNJ	0080297382	234794831	The Application of Chess Theory (Russian Chess)	Books	3	18	21	N	N	Not for beginners. Class A is about right	100 games, well annotated. Each is preceded by some historical background. Often, there are anecdotes embedded within the text. There are plenty of comments amongst the ample and occasionally comprehensive annotation. In principle, this is a fine book, for a fairly advanced player.<br />Geller devotes the most attention to opening variations. Half the book is arranged by opening, in fact, and the other half by player, which makes me think that Geller was never sure whether he sought to illuminate the openings or to show off his own victories.<br />And yes, he has only victories here, but they are not all brilliantly won games. For example, in Game 99 against Fischer, he reveals after Fischer's<BR>20. a3?<BR>\\"This loses in paradoxical fashion. As Fischer writes, a couple of hours after the game he found the problem-like win.... [extensive analysis follows]... This is the truth, established after many years of painstaking analysis. The number of moves with two exclamation points demanded of White shows how difficult it was to find all this during the restricted time of one game. A calculation of all the variations was impossible, and intuition in sharp situations was not Fischer's strongest weapon.\\" A very intersting comment.<br />If you're a strong player looking for instruction on a wide variety of openings, then this book may be recommended. It is far too advanced for me.<br />This may be a petty complaint, but there is something visually unattractive about the contents. It may be the old-style diagrams, where to me the black and white queens are nearly indistinguishable. It may be the in-line algebraic annotations, which are in the exact same font as the text. It may be the lightness of the printing. Whatever the reason, I do not enjoy opening this book. However, the format is certainly superior to Bronstein's popular Zurich collection, so I may hold the minority opinion. Also, the Cadogan cover and binding are typically sturdy.<br />I think the book is aimed at about 1900-2000 rated players.	2003-05-10
US	49179982	RGFAC2E587YSM	0713487127	13540895	Ideas Behind the Modern Chess Openings (Batsford Chess Book)	Books	3	17	22	N	N	Somewhere between guidelines and memorized moves.	This is not exactly similar to Fine's Ideas Behind the Chess Openings, as the title might suggest. It's not a modern version, and it's a bit more complicated than just basic ideas.<br />This is more like a repertoire book in that it has sometimes deep lines of annotation for variations of an opening, and I normally advocate against studying repertoire books. However, if you absolutely must have an opening repertoire as White, you could do worse than the London System, which is a large part of what this book teaches. (Usually, 1.d4 ... 2.Nf3 ... 3.Bf4)<br />Strictly speaking, this is a \\"system\\", not a repertoire, since the idea is to develop your pieces into a typical structure largely independent of what Black does. You can play nearly the same move order, with nearly the same basic plans for almost any response by Black, and you will have attacking chances on the kingside.<br />Other systems are the Colle System, the Barcza Opening (explained in Seirawan's Winning Chess Openings), and Purdy's System in his 24 Hour Opening Repertoire book.<br />1.d4? Hmmm. I think it makes more sense to stick to open games (1.e4) while you're learning tactics below master level. If you want cheap, occasional victories, try gambits. But a system can be useful if you want a chance to reach the middlegame against stronger players. (You'll still lose, but the game will SEEM even for longer.)<br />If you think you want to learn the London System, I suggest that you start with Saddler's Tips for Young Players (not really for young players at all!) where he demonstrates the London System with a thorough explanation of all his moves in a single game, in a way which early intermediate players can comprehend. Then tackle this book if you're still interested.<br />Still, this book does a good job of explaining the goals and strategies behind many modern openings which are common in club play. If you follow one of the basic systems described here (including the Barry Attack and others) you won't have to memorize moves in order to have a decent game against such modern defenses as the Grunfeld, King's Indian Defence, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Dutch, Benoni, etc.<br />Or, you could play 1.e4 and study tactics instead of openings...n't have to memorize moves in order to have a decent game against such modern defenses as the Grunfeld, King's Indian Defence, Nimzo-Indian Defence, Dutch, Benoni, etc.<br />Or, you could play 1.e4 and study tactics instead of openings...	2003-05-02

You don't have to flip to the back, but you do have to avert your eyes. At least the answers are not in bold-faced.<br />Then he gives you different numbers of points for correct answers to different questions. In theory, you could add up all your points. I find it simpler just to notice how often I correctly answer questions of varying degrees of difficulty.<br />The tests, each consisting of several separate diagrammed puzzles, concentrate on the movements of a particular piece, rather than a particular tactic. This makes the tests particularly easy, since you already know which piece is going to move. That's not a good way to get a realistic assessment of your abilities, but it's fine for drilling tactics, particularly knight moves, which are particularly difficult for beginners to see.<br />The test games are full of tactical opportunities, and Walker pauses with a diagram at each one. When the tactics get a bit deep (more than 2 moves, since this is a beginner book) he breaks up his annotations into &quot;if A, B, C,&quot; etc. That is helpful.<br />In short: A good book for drilling tactics. A fair book for learning the tactics. A poor book for self-assessment, so the title is a misnomer.<br />Excellent format. Easy to read. You can do a couple of problems in your spare time quickly. You can go through a full game without a board. Good beginner book, for about 1250 USCF rating. But only 4 stars because of the price.	2003-04-14

It comes somewhere between checkmate pattern books, like How to Beat Your Dad At Chess and The Art of Checkmate, and an annotated collection of quick victories, like a book on Morphy (the old master of attack!).<br />This is perfect for amateurs. It has about 100 games, mostly complete, with a light level of very helpful annotation. Very readable and realistic. The games are full of blunders, each of which the author explains. This contrasts with so many collections of master games in which a series of quiet, strategic moves culminates in a brilliant combination. The game fragments demonstrate themes, while the full games illustrate poor opening moves or mistaken ideas. <br />Most blunders are followed by a diagram, so instead of playing through the games, you could use the book as a series of tactical exercises. These blunders are typical of the errors in amateur play, and the best responses, though not trivial, are within reach.<br />After reading this book, you'll have a sense of when to pounce on your opponent. You'll also have a keenrer understanding of opening principles, as the author explains mistakes in clear English.<br />Minor drawback: There are only a few examples of queenside castling.<br />For USCF 1300-1500 rated players.

This is a bit more unusual, but still common in amateur play. For this reason, I'd say that this book is suited for slightly lower rated players than the Castled one, maybe 1150-1350 USCF.<br />In fact, much of this book consists of opening blunders, and as such is an excellent way to improve your opening play.<br />On the other hand, I think that the format of the Pandolfini trap books is preferable, including the large diagrams and the fact that they are arranged by opening. This book is mainly for flipping through idly on the bus. Because it's so cheap (six bucks on the internet) I give it 4 stars.	2003-04-11

I like the presentation of this book better than the older classics. A bit simpler, and broader in scope, than Seirawan's \\"Winning Chess Strategies\\".<br />I don't know if this is really the best book for \\"young players\\". Not bad, especially for high school age, but the lay-out and language are not suited to young beginners.<br />This book is ideal for improving players who have played a few dozen games and want to know a bit of strategy. Use this along with a book of fairly simple tactical puzzles, like \\"Simple Checkmates\\" and \\"Chess Tactics for Juniors\\". (Drilling tactics is more important than studying strategy or memorizing openings.)<br />For USCF 1200-1400 rating range, I think.<br />If you're at the high end of that range, the early part of the book will be a useful summary of what you already know.<br />The meat of the book is the incredibly lengthy annotation of (mostly) just a single game played by the author. <br />In one chapter he uses the game to show opening principles and goals, particularly in the author's chosen opening scheme, the \\"London System\\". This is more useful than the \\"opening ideas\\" books, which just tell a sentence or two about each opening, and much more useful than the repertoire books, which go far too deep into variations.<br />Later, he walks into the middle-game, showing the sort of attack on the castled king that he looks for in this system, some sound positional strategies in reasonable depth, and a particular position that harbors a clever tactic which would ordinarily be much too deep for a beginner, but which (on page 116) he breaks into digestible pieces so that by the end of the page you feel as if you understand something brilliant.<br />Then, he demonstrates important rook-and-pawn end-game themes by following this very game to its conclusion.<br />This single game justifies the price of the book. I have no idea where else you might look to find so much beginner-level exposition concentrated on just one game. An excellent precursor to Silman!<br />Combined with all the tips throughout, it's a very nice package.	2003-04-01

It is actually a book of annotated games. The annotations are appropriate to early intermediate players -- not full of deep variations, but also not just some dumb comment on every move (which is especially annoying in the opening). It's more like every 3rd or 4th move. This is perfect for describing strategies concisely.<br />The strategies are practical, not deep. The games were carefully selected to illuminate basic principles. These are not \\"brilliancies\\" with sudden, crushing defeats based on deeply analyzed tactics. These show one player making stronger moves than his opponent -- stronger, but still understandable. I think the author has done a good job with his selection.<br />Each section does have about 2 pages of text describing the principles, but it's mainly a book to be used with a chess board. Play the moves and read the author's comments. Sometimes he points out the tactical threats (which are obvious to an advanced player) and that's where a board is useful.<br />Unlike Chernev's \\"Logical Chess Move by Move\\", this is not for a beginner hoping to get a feel for the drama in the struggles on the chessboard. It is as instructive as Bronstein's highly praised annotations of the Zurich International, but at a much lower level.<br />USCF 1400-1700 rating.<br />4 stars as an inexpensive and comprehensibly annotated collection of elucidating games. But if you're on a budget, skip this book and buy one of Reinfeld's puzzle books.	2003-04-01

Seems like a rip-off for the money, right?<br />No! I just wish it were longer!<br />You see the puzzle, and then you get some ideas from 5 different patzers. (This is similar to Silman's \\"Amateur's Mind\\" and Euwe's \\"Chess Master v. Chess Amateur\\", which use patzer games for analysis of positions and instruction of principles.) The subjects range from spotting weaknesses in a complex position to finding the winning ideas in a simple endgame. These are not Mate-in-x or tactical combination puzzles (although there are tactics in some that you have to spot) but they all have clear solutions once you understand them.<br />What makes this book fun is debunking the bad ideas. I often cannot figure out the problem, but I always feel superior to at least one or two of Ward's colorful characters! And since that's the level of competition I play against, this book is perfect for me! I feel as if this book actually makes me a better player. (That's hard to prove, but I definitely view my own games more circumspectly now.) I am reading it cover to cover!<br />USCF 1200-1500 rating. If you're only 1200, you might not get ANY of these puzzles, but you will still understand the solutions and learn a tremendous amount.<br />Avoid the older blue-cover \\"It's Your Move\\" by the same author. It's not bad, but it's too hard (and at that level, Silman is better). The \\"Improvers\\" version is much easier.<br />=========<br />I've noticed that Amazon thinks these are different editions of the same book. No. The blue book \\"It's Your Move\\" and the red book \\"It's Your Move: Improvers\\" are completely different books. (And now there is an even more advanced book, yellow I think, which I have not looked at.)<br />The blue book is a two-star effort. It is basically 50 annotated games, with only one move of annotation for each game. As a positional chess quiz book, there are much better choices: e.g. by Kosten, Bellini,or Evans.<br />The problem with the blue book is stated in its introduction: The author does not want to waste his time explaining why the bad moves are bad. I ask, \\"Why not?\\" That would have made this book useful, especially if these games were club (rather than master) level.<br />How did one author compose two books of nearly identical look and feel but polar opposites in quality? It's a mystery.	2003-04-01

You don't have to search for the answer in the back, but you also won't accidentally notice the answer as you might if it were directly under the diagram. Very simple!<br />These are not only realistic, but actually from old master games. The players and games are named, which gives a whiff of historical significance. Reinfeld often adds a sentence to the answer to tell us something about the players, or the game, or the circumstances. That adds some drama to an otherwise dry book of puzzles.<br />Unfortunately, the diagrams in this book must be third or fourth generation copies. They are too light. Look inside the book and see for yourself! This is exacerbated by the old-style drawings of the pieces, which makes the queens difficult to distinguish from each other.<br />Maybe Dover will do a new edition in Algebraic Notation with new diagrams? (This one is in Descriptive Notation, but the answers are so short that it's really not a problem. In fact, I prefer Descriptive for puzzles, since QxB is easier to visualize than Qxe4.)<br />I do not know how many of these puzzles appear in other Reinfeld books, but for the price you can't complain.	2003-04-01

Since there is a grading scale for the number of correct answers out of 20, I assumed that the questions must get harder throughout a given test. Unfortunately, the tests themselves get harder, so the grading scale is worthless.<br />But maybe this is a good thing. For learning, it is better to have puzzles grouped by difficulty. (For accurate grading, try Test Your Chess IQ.)<br />The difficulty seems to be around 1400-1800. There is a book by Lein (Sharpen Your Tactics) which has about the same range.<br />These are combinations mainly, not checkmate puzzles. Reinfeld's How to Checkmate would be a good companion. And if you can find it (OOP) Chernev and Reinfeld's \\"Winning Chess\\" is, in my opinion, the very best way to learn the types of combinations to look for. (Seirawan's Winning Chess Tactics and Znosko's Art of Chess Combination are also good for that, though the latter is quite a bit more advanced.)<br />This book is nothing but diagrams for drilling. No explanations. And no hints! That's closer to real conditions than some puzzle books are. And as the puzzles are from real games, they are of course realistic, not contrived compositions. However, many of them point out real blunders and real oversights!<br />The diagrams are very clear, not old-style--maybe a bit small, but only because the book's dimensions are small. At the bottom of the page is a little comment about the game, usually revealing nothing about the solution. This really does make each puzzle more interesting. The answers, at the end of each 20-puzzle section, are described in words as well as in algebraic notation, and that helps to make the book less dry as well.<br />New algebraic edition, thankfully. A 5-star book for the money.	2003-03-31

This one is fine, but if you plan to buy the larger one eventually, you are better off finding a different book of simple tactics. For that, maybe Seirawan's Winning Chess Tactics, Chernev/Reinfeld's Winning Chess, a Pandolfini book, or even Simple Checkmates for the rudiments.<br />But if you're on a budget and you want only 1 book, this is a very good one.	2003-02-06

(This is similar to more advanced checkmate books, but at a very simple level.)<BR>* Then, a couple of diagrams with arrows, showing the motion of the key pieces, with the moves written below. Very good for improving visualization, so you might spot the pattern later.<BR>* Then another similar pattern, with 2 diagrams.<BR>* Then a couple of positions for you to work out yourself, with solutions directly underneath.<BR>* And finally, near the back of the book, a set of a few dozen positions. They include theme numbers for you to use as hints if necessary. Solutions are separate. This reinforces the learning.<br />These are all attacks on the castled king, not How To Take Advantage of Opening Blunders, or How To Solve Unlikely Chess Positions. These positions can actually occur in your games, even Fischerandom. The attacks are simple, but not obvious. Some are even by the Black pieces!<br />Nice hardcover for a thin book. Large diagrams. Feels great in your hands. Very well-designed.<br />Excellent book for someone rated between 1200 and 1500. I keep it in the bathroom. (I use different chess books in different ways. I take tactics puzzles to the gym. I always keep a chessboard handy for endgame books. I use a miniature set for studying openings. And I follow along with game anthologies by using a computer database and watching the computer analysis. And I am improving rapidly.)<br />Do one theme (two pages) per day. In two months you'll have actually finished an entire chessbook, and you'll miss it! You will find yourself improving your own defenses because you'll know what to look out for. One of the few chess books you'll actually read cover to cover, and it's cheap for a hardcover.	2003-02-06

This seems counter-intuitive, but it is the best way to make your brain understand how the pieces move. A combination of tactics and endgame training is the quickest route to success for the average player. Don't waste time on the openings until you are a Master, rated 2000+.<br />This book is perfect for learning, as opposed to simply memorizing. The reason is that each page builds on the previous page, and each section on the previous section. You don't need to wade through pages of variations because, by the time you get to a given lesson, you have already learned the positions which result from the alternate moves. That moment of Eureka makes the book great fun!<br />For example, he shows you how to mate with various pieces, so that you know a won endgame when you see one. In these lessons, he'll show you what a King-Bishop-Bishop v. King mate looks like in the corner. Then he'll show you how to roll the King into the corner across the edge of the board. Then he'll show you how to get that bishop-roll started. Each lesson typically ends with a position from a previous lesson, so you can play it out to reinforce what you had learned earlier. <br />Later, he shows you how to turn a pawn into a Queen in various pawn endings. Again, some lessons end in previously learned positions. Others are simply new positions to learn, but of gradually increasing difficulty. At appropriate times, he shows you the stalemate opportunities to watch out for. And it's all at a beginner level (around 1000-1400 USCF) avoiding deep variations to keep track of in your head. <br />The way to use the book is to play a lesson out on a board, to test all possible refuations yourself. When you get lost, refer back to the book. I've been going over this book that way with a friend, which is a great way to learn ALL tries and refutations!<br />I have several other endgame books. I wish I could obtain the Out-Of-Print Seirawan book, but this is by far the best beginner bookin print. Silman's Essential Chess Endings Explained Move by Move is a good second book, with some overlap, if you can find it.<br />Some people complain about the many typos in Pandolfini books. To me, finding the typo is just part of solving the problem. Since he always explains in words where the pieces are generally headed, then follows with lines of chess notation, it's very easy to spot his mistake. Still, only 4 1/2 stars, because of the typos.	2003-02-04
US	49179982	R1E935RP09YJGP	067179499X	37630913	More Chess Openings: Traps and Zaps 2 (Fireside Chess Library)	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Before you learn to play an opening, learn how NOT to!	This is for beginners, rated below 1300 USCF. Most of the traps are fairly obvious (though some have snagged Grandmasters) but the point is to be aware of them before they occur, so that they do not occur! <br />In that sense, a book on traps is important before you prepare an opening repertoire. I would look at this book first, then the one by Chernev, and finally the one by Graham Burgess, the last of which is from high-level play. Only then does it make sense to spend any time thinking about the theoretically BEST moves. Chess is about tactics far more than it is about memorization. Just play SAFE moves, and study tactics.<br />Personally, I use this book for drilling simple tactics into my head. I do not go over the opening lines. I just look for the best refutation of what is shown in each diagram. Already, I have improved dramatically in Internet blitz games, because I make fewer blunders and take advantage of my adversaries'.<br />The coverage of this book is White-king-pawn two-step (1.e4) followed by something other than Black-king-pawn two-step (e5). Pandolfini's first Traps and Zaps book covers the dual king-pawn openings, and the zaps are a bit less obvious in that book. Unfortunately, neither covers queen-pawn openings. I recommend Chernev's Winning Chess Traps for broader coverage (and for deeper, less blunderous traps in general). (Addendum: There are d4, c4, and other openings in the undiagrammed \\"Related Zaps\\" at the bottom of each page, useful if you're willing to take the time to walk through the moves.)<br />The more Pandolfini books I try, the more I like them!<br />Oh. Only 4 stars because of errata. Annoying, but always easy to find and fix.	2003-02-04

I use this book at the gym while I'm exercising. That forces me to see the patterns without thinking too much. I am trying to see the solutions as quickly as possible. Chess is pattern-matching (i.e. tactics) first, strategy second, and MAYBE memorization of opening lines a distant third.<br />This is the method suggested in Rapid Chess Improvement. After you've completely mastered these positions, so that you solve them instantly, you can proceed to a harder set, maybe something by Reinfeld.<br />The format is designed for children, but that doesn't bother me at all. If it makes you feel better, donate it to a child after you've read it 5 times.	2003-02-04

This book is a bit advanced.	Not a beginner book. Great format. Great selection of positions to learn. But you need to be over 1500 USCF before this book will have value for you. Study simpler tactics first.<br />Addendum:<BR>My opinion of this book has risen steadily. I enjoy this book, and I am starting to watch for elements of the positions I have seen in it. Multiple readings are valuable, especially if you take the time to see why the key moves work. If a couple of pieces were moved, would the combination still work?<br />A truly excellent chess book.	2003-02-04

Yes, there are stock market frauds, price manipulations, and other dastardly tactics. One man is as prone to error as the next, including the author.<br />Nothing is certain. Life is about risk. Greater rewards entail greater risks. If you're a small investor with no inside information, you are especially likely to get duped. Fine. That's a good lesson.<br />The author goes too far. If everyone followed his advice, there would be no IPOs, no new companies, no banks, no investment of any sort. And just as some investors complain about negative predictions, some short-sellers protest too much about the high hopes of risk-takers. Not all the unfortunate stocks in this book are scams.
