It was enjoyable, yet I found myself skimming a bit early on. A lot of the early portions were disjointed, and even somewhat boring. Definitely not enough time was spent on the actual \\"mystery.\\" Too much information on the characters began to get on my nerves. Perhaps there were too many characters in the book? It seemed that the authors wanted to make us know everyone, even the more minor characters. Despite my criticism, it was definitely a fun book, and I'm glad I took the time to read it!	2005-05-23

That was my mistake, because it sounded quite good when I read the back. I was looking for something light and fun. But the entire book is so disjointed. Many times I found myself going back to re-read a sentence that was so awkwardly structured, you couldn't figure it out the first time. It really reads like a first draft that hasn't been edited. A pity, because it could be a charming (even if somewhat fluffy) tale to read.<br /><br />Another word of warning...there are LOTS of references to British Lit, so if you're not familiar with writers from Keats to Enid Blyton, you may not pick up on some of the attempted jokes.	2005-02-13

Actually, I could barely trudge through this book, it was THAT boring. The author has no distinct voice. In fact, it's as if she just looked around the Internet and library and put together a bunch of facts about dreaming. It read like a college student's report... with much too many references to other research. If you're interested in the regurgitated history of dreams, then you might like this book, but I honestly was hoping for something more, not just a textbook.	2005-02-07

I've had a few healing dreams myself (though not to the extent of Marc Ian Barasch). This book really has helped me with understanding signs, and giving more faith to the information my dreams are trying to get through to me. Very powerful book, I highly recommend it to anyone who is curious about the world of dreaming, or even simply someone who wants to better understand symbolism in their own dreams.	2005-02-07

Sophie Kinsella first captivated me with her Shopaholic series, and \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" has done it again! I read it in two evenings flat, just couldn't put it down last night.<br /><br />Emma is your average 20-something, trying to make it in marketing. She has an evil cousin who always makes fun of her for not being as successful as she has been. Then something changes. Emma has a \\"near death experience\\" when flying on a business trip. She spills all her deepest, darkest secrets to the mystery man next to her--intimate things including the fact that her boyfriend doesn't satisfy her (even though all her friends seem to think they are the perfect couple). All is fine until Emma walks into work, hearing whispers that Jack, the President of the company will be visiting...you guessed it--Jack is the mystery man from the plane!!!<br /><br />I absolutely loved the charisma between the Jack and Emma. From all that she told him, he knows EXACTLY how to get to her, to rile her up. The book gave me quite a few laughs! A wonderful read, definitely don't pass this one up!	2004-09-28

I've read all of Helen Fielding's books (though I really must admit--I couldn't make it through Cause Celeb, *yawn*). After reading the first chapter of Olivia, I was worried it would be another failed attempt from Fielding. But then things started looking up.<br /><br />Olivia won me over. I like to think of her as a Bridget Jones meets Sydney Bristow. I'm a big fan of the tv series Alias, and it was sort of like having Bridget thrown into a spy role, which led to many funny moments.<br /><br />I ended up thoroughly enjoying the book, and didn't put it down all day! Very pleased with the ending as well. Three cheers, Fielding has done it again!	2004-09-20

I very much enjoyed reading The Tipping Point, which I read for a local book club. It has lots of interesting theories, stories, and examples. The one that that got a bit on my nerve was the--what I felt was--excessive repetition. I believe that Gladwell used this style to make the book more \\"sticky,\\" but it was annoying. (This is the only reason the book didn't get 5 stars from me.)<br /><br />He makes up for it with the interesting tales, and sometimes even comedic writing. I really enjoyed his theory that \\"yawning\\" is a good example of an epidemic. I also enjoyed the different stories about advertising and how word of mouth can be extremely effective. I felt really inspired after reading it, and I really hope that San Francisco's mayor (Gavin Newsome), who said that he recently read this book, will do something about the state of some of San Francisco's more dangerous areas, like the Tenderloin.<br /><br />I think this is a great book for anyone in the business world (especially advertising and marketing) to read.	2004-09-20

There is insightful information on finding a job. It made me feel better when I had a hard time finding a job. But some of it got a little blah. I found myself skipping pages out of boredom, which is never a good sign. Sadly, Bourland spends a majority of the book on dating. This is what I ended up skipping a lot of. That said, there are definitely parts that I am sure I will go back and re-read whenever I'm down.<br />Recommended for those who are recent graduates without a job and/or boyfriend!	2004-05-18

Paulsen assumes that his reader has read the first book and doesn't readdress Brian's struggle with his parent's divorce.<br />Despite this however, it's a fun book for any kids interested in the wild. Gary Paulsen is a master of telling great adventures; kids will be captivated at how Brian manages to save himself in the harshest of months, with nothing but a few camp supplies. Kids will definitely marvel at his survival skills.	2001-07-03

Many people have compared it to Harry Potter, (which it definitely isn't), simply because it's a fantasy novel for children. It can't measure up to Harry, mostly due to Artemis' lack of charm. He shouldn't be named &quot;Fowl,&quot; but Foul. He's intelligent, which kids will love (he outsmarts fairies and adults alike), but he's bad...bad to the bone. And he could kick Draco Malfoy's butt!<br />12-year old Artemis' father was killed, so he decides that it is his job to regain the fortune his father lost (mind you, the Fowls were only rich due to centuries of stealing and thievery). He can't depend on his mother, because she's an incompetent, senile drunk, still not over the loss of her husband.<br />I think parents best read this book first, before letting their children. Mature issues are discussed frankly, and they may be a little too mature for younger children. There is violence, violence, death, alcohol abuse, etc. Even so, I found it quite entertaining, and would recommend it. Just don't buy it to read to your toddlers.	2001-06-07

It had me in stitches! As usual, Bridget is constantly struggling with work, her (keeping her) boyfriend, (losing) weight, (quitting) smoking and (quitting) drinking. One thing that was much more evident in The Edge of Reason than BJD was the way Fielding shines in writing about normal things. She really makes them seem spectacular.<br />I have to admit that my favorite part was Bridget's interview with her favorite actor--and wearer of wet, white shirts--Colin Firth. I was literally laughing aloud. The book is worth it just for that part alone! Also memorable is Bridget's stint in jail. Women all over will relate to Bridget. Great fun!	2001-05-04

Probably my favorite so far of the Harry Potter series (1-4 anyway!), PoA allows the audience to gain insight (along with Harry!) on what happened when You Know Who killed Harry's parents. The dreaded dementors flock to Hogwarts to search for the escaped Sirius Black, and cause Harry lots of problems; dementors thrive on human emotions, and cause Harry to re-live the events leading up to his parents murder whenever they get near him. Despite this, they give Harry (and the audience) a chance to learn more about himself.<br />Hermione is at her best in this book, overloading on classes, and stressing herself to bits. And if not for her, justice could not have been served!<br />We see a more emotional Ron, when something comes between him and his beloved Scabbers.<br />Quidditch! There's plenty of it in the PoA. I loved every minute of it!<br />And lastly, Sirius Black. I really enjoyed getting to know his character. It was a relief to find out that Harry has a guardian and confidant he can contact if he ever has any problems. Lord knows the Dursleys won't help him!<br />All in all, I found this book excellent--the characters all go through important developments, which will undoubtedly impact the following books. A superb effort by J.K. Rowling!	2001-03-07

Main character Daniel Martin isn't the brightest kid in school--he gets made fun of a lot. But when he and his classmates get stranded in the wilderness, he saves the day.<br />Will help to teach children not to necessarily judge others by their appearance.

His writing is brilliant. In Shopgirl, Martin creates an tale so real, it's uncanny. It could have happened to any one of us! Mirabelle is a shy, naive 28-year old who works in the glove department at Neiman's. Over the course of the novel, she discovers herself, losing her innocense in a way that seems inevitable to each and every one of us.<br />The book truly hit close to home with me. Martin's characters are all so REAL. Jeremy, is the bumbling, clueless &quot;boy&quot;, who finally grows up. Ray, the rich, older man, doesn't know who or what he wants. Both teach Mirabelle how to free herself--how to become independent.<br />With Martin's background in comedy, some might expect this to be a funny story. Instead, it's a serious portrayal of life. Even so, it never lost my interest; in fact, it met all my high expectations. All three main characters are so likeable, even Ray, with his perpetual cheating. Bravo to Martin for such a great first novel. I can't wait for the next one!	2001-02-21

This section starts off with you as an FBI agent, being tested on how much you know about the crash, and the suspects living in Roswell. Better study hard, or you'll end up with a desk job!<br />The Real Investigation: More questions about the different characters. Are you as informed as Nasedo, or are you as in the dark as Kyle?<br />Friends, Lovers, and Enemies: Do you know what the terms Candygirl, Dreamgirl, and Stargazer refer to? If not, you'll be in trouble in this section!<br />Do You Remember When?: How good are you with dates? This section covers dates ranging from the UFO crash in 1947 to Liz's first diary entry.<br />Episode Highlights: If you missed any episodes from season 1, this chapter could be tough. It asks questions about each season 1 episode--fill in the blank!<br />Grand Total: This is the section where all your totals are calculated! Are you a True Believer, or just a Tourist? I didn't do very well the first time I took the quiz, but I've done better each time I've taken it. I'm definitely a True Believer! This book is a must-have for any Roswell obsessive!

This book was the first book (to my knowledge) to be written about the Roswell cast. It gives great bios of Jason, Shiri, Brendan, Colin, Maj, Kat, and Nick!<br />I was pleasantly surprised (usually unofficial books aren't this good) with the thoroughness of the material. It even includes a section of &quot;what's on the menu at the Crashdown Cafe!&quot;<br />The colored pictures section is awesome as well--it even has pictures of the cast members BEFORE Roswell, like Maj with Tony Danza, and Brendan on Our Guys. There's also a cute picture of Majandra with Miko Hughes (arg, baby Nikolas!!!!!!!) when they were in &quot;Zeus and Roxanne.&quot;<br />I found out a lot of things I didn't know, including where Brendan started (modeling in Canada).

This calendar is awesome! The only complaints I have are that it's of season one. Not a single season two photo is incuded. The other thing I'm willing to bet will turn away buyers is the fact that the back doesn't show what photos are included. It only shows January and three other photos (without the month). Here's what is included:<br />January - This is the only one that shows up on the back; Shiri and Jason's promo shot with the fence behind them.<br />February - The dance scene, where Colin and Kat are dancing the night away. Perfect for Valentine's day!<br />March - Shiri's promo show with the fence behind her.<br />April - Jason, Kat, and Brendan promo shot. Jason's wearing a red shirt, Kat a blue one with white stripes, and Brendan a brown shirt.<br />May - What I'm beginning to think is the most popular Jason pic. It's the one of him against a wall wearing a black shirt.<br />June - Maj wearing black with the fence behind her.<br />July - Shiri and Jason--the same photo as the poster of them. Jason's wearing blue, Shiri's wearing red.<br />August - Kat wearing a reddish-brown leather (?) jacket.<br />September - promo pic of Nick Wechsler wearing a blue shirt.<br />October - Jason wearing blue and Shiri wearing pink.<br />November - Brendan sitting down wearing a black sweater and blue jeans.<br />December - The cast pic of the &quot;main four&quot; Kat, Jason, Shiri, Brendan.<br />As you can tell, the calendar really focuses on Jason and Shiri. I was a bit disappointed they gave Stargazers (fans of Alex and Isabel) a month, but not Candygirls (fans of Michael and Maria); however, Dreamgirls (fans of Max and Liz) will love this calendar. It includes quotes with each month that will help Roswell fans remember some of the best moments of season one. Great gift for any Roswell fan!	2000-11-23

I love Shakespeare, and I thought this book would be<br />informative, but I was sadly mistaken. Marx uses mainly his own<br />opinion as &quot;proof&quot; of connections between Shakespeare and<br />the Bible. Of course there are &quot;connections&quot;--Shakespeare<br />lived in Elizabethan England. But I wouldn't go so far as to compare<br />King Lear to Job or The Tempest to Revelations. Marx's comparisions<br />are feable and superficial at best.<br />He remains unconvincing<br />throughout the book, which he pitifully tried to force into a format<br />like Shakespeare's plays.

I like to think I'm an objective person. Sadly, this book fell way short of what I was expecting.<br />Hitler's name shows up on the same page as Holocaust...at least that's what Drosnin says. But for those of us not able to read Hebrew (or Aramaic) this book is pretty much worthless. All of his examples of \\"proof\\" are in an alphabet and language that I don't understand. This type of proof is worthless! To convince me there's really something there, I'd have to see it in my own language...or learn Hebrew! Not to mention one can find a code in pretty much everything if one really wants to. I just can't buy this idea that the future is explicitly written. If it was, the concept of free will doesn't really exist. God would have already known exactly how each one of us would turn out.<br />Overall, the book was not only unconvincing, but poorly written. I wouldn't recommend it.	2000-11-06

Only two books have ever managed to bring tears to my eyes, and this was one of them.<br />Even though I'm not Armenian, I've read countless books about both Armenia and the Genocide. This definitely is one of the best. It's easy to understand (though the fact that it happened is still so difficult for me to comprehend).<br />If you're an Armenian parent (or grandparent!) struggling to tell your teen about it, this book will help greatly.

He handed me this book (after he'd read it himself) and told me to read it. Worried it was just another dull, on-going investment book, I procrastinated... but when I finally started to read it, I was pleasantly surprised! It's very easy to read, fun, short, and to the point. My dad also made my mom read it, and he's planning on buying more copies to loan out to friends! It's really helped our whole family. If anyone out there is having a hard time getting a friend interested in mutual funds or any type of investing, this point will get the point across! Great deal for the money- and a great stocking stuffer!	2000-10-07

When reading Shakespeare, one of my teachers explained to us that certain plants and flowers has special significance to the Elizabethans. I searched on the web but was unable to find this. When I saw World of Shakespeare's Plants at the local bookstore, I immediately bought it. It's been a valuable tool in all my Shakespeare studies. Must have for any Shakespeare scholar!	2000-10-02

Where other scholars books would drone on and on in a monotonous way, Rutherford gets history across to his readers through fiction. London was particularly interesting to me- I picked up my copy when I was studying in London and read it religiously on my tube commute. I already knew quite a bit about London's history, which made me appreciate all of the little jokes in it. This book is great for &quot;newbies&quot; to London's history as well as those who already know it. Very refreshing and highly recommended!	2000-10-02

Sports and Other Pasttimes clears up a lot of confusion on what living in the World of Shakespeare might have been like. For students in the modern day, it's hard to picture what things were like 400 years ago. Dent helps us overcome that with this handy book. When I read the Merry Wives of Windsor, I was unsure of what &quot;Bear Baiting&quot; was reference to. Turns out the Elizabethans had the oddly dangerous hobby of dancing with bears. I learned many things just browsing through this book. It's a great find--very useful!	2000-10-02

I've seen many books that excerpt Will's love sonnets and dialogues, and this one is no different--except for one thing. It includes wonderful pictures from the movie--mostly of Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow. If you're a fan of the movie Shakespeare in Love (I am!!!!), you'll definitely love this book; however, if you're looking for a more complete verion of the Bard's work, you'd be better investing in an anthology.	2000-10-02

I actually had the pleasure of taking a course with Inchausti before I read his book. So many of the ideas and stories in Spitwad Sutras were those that he used in our class, so I was able to compare how effective they'd been. The only problem some people might have with it are the religious overtones; however, I feel they only add to the charm of the book. I wasn't able to put it down once--read it straight through! Inchausti offers much wisdom to those new to teaching. Give this book a read; it'll help you when you start teaching, or it might be able to revive the spark you had when you first started. Well worth the money!	2000-10-01

It really did help me feel more in touch with myself; however, the editor did a terrible job. It comes off at times as unintelligent with simple grammar mistakes, etc. As a linguist, I find this extremely perturbing. All of a sudden you have to go back and reread a sentence 3 or 4 times before you realize what it means. It's a shame because it makes Bonheim, an extremely wise and intelligent woman, look uneducated. If you can get by the editing, this book does have some great stories from women of all different backgrounds. I would really love to see a new edition of it because it's something long overdue. Women everywhere will relate to it and enjoy it.	2000-09-30

I'm a huge Shakespeare fan and I'd love to get the chance to meet Macrone. Brush Up Your Shakespeare is intelligently divided into sub sections including Famous Quotes, Words Coined by the Bard, Words often misattributed to Shakespeare, and Titles Borrowed From Shakespeare. Not only is this book easy to read, it also is concise. It's great for a student who's just curious to learn a little more about Will, who doesn't have the time to pore over hundreds of research papers on him. It was also extremely interesting to me (a Linguistics minor) because of all the lexicography. A great book to own--at a reasonable price!	2000-09-30

I'm so glad they came out with a new edition of this book so I had the chance to purchase it (even if I was a bit dismayed to see Mel Gibson on the cover instead of Kenneth Branagh)! My friend had the older edition, which I borrowed frequently while taking a Shakespeare course. Each scene is covered in depth, almost like a summary. It might actually be better titled &quot;What Happens TO Hamlet&quot; because once you finish the book, you feel like you know the man! Great for any student of Shakespeare, or for that matter, anyone interested in Shakespeare or the Prince of Denmark at all!	2000-09-30

I'd definitely recommend it for any college student studying Shakespeare; it'll give you a break from all that dull, monotonous criticism. Even though it's a &quot;humor&quot; book, it does have some intriguing info on what double meanings are found in Shakespeare's plays. You might even find some useful information for research papers (the book even includes a chapter entitled &quot;Racism in Shakespeare&quot;). Great for linguists, Shakespeare fans, and students alike!	2000-09-30

Granville-Barker is widely-known as one of the best critics to look to for information on Shakespeare. This book proves that. It's a great resource for any student of Shakespeare. If you can find a copy, buy it immediately! There's a reason it's out of print!	2000-09-30

It's one of the only books I could find that didn't assume that one already knows notation. In fact, notation isn't even used. It's touched upon, and Eade encourages the reader to learn it, but he concentrates more on terms and openings and basic strategy, rather than scaring away someone new to chess by forcing them to learn notation immediately. I even got my friend to read it. She'd never played chess before and found it quite easy to read. It's a great book for beginners 18 and up. I'd definitely recommend it for chess players trying to get a spouse or friend involved in this exciting sport.	2000-09-30

Fugard creates a memorable character in Hally, a white South African boy. Hally discovers that the color of one's skin is not as important as he previously thought. Even though this is a theme prominent in Fugard's other plays, Fugard still triumphs. It falls short of My Children! My Africa!, yet remains a masterpiece in its own rite. It's difficult to explain why, but something about Hally and how he deals with others helped me to feel more &quot;human.&quot; Definitely give it a read!	2000-09-29

I frequently referred to it in the past year while I was taking two Shakespeare classes, but I also found myself reading it in my spare time! If you're a Shakespeare scholar you'll appreciate how rare it is to find Shakespeare criticism that reads as easily as a novel. It's perfect for students taking Shakespeare 101, but also for more advanced students (It helped a lot in the graduate level Shakespeare course I took). All Shakespeare fanatics should pick up a copy of this book. I don't care how pretentious or opinionated anyone thinks Bloom is. He did an excellent job with this book! Bravo!!!	2000-09-29

My Africa! was the first book I've read ever to make me cry--so much towards the end that I had to put it down. It is the touching tale of a white South African girl who befriends a black South African boy and his teacher, amidst a time of strong racial tension. Their teacher helps them to learn that even though others may be at war, they still have the chance to pave the road to a new, better Africa. Fugard's best play ever!	2000-09-29

In the age we're living in today, this is the perfect satire of police departments. We always here in the news about some cop in some city getting caught framing someone innocent (or sometimes worse). Fo does a wonderful job of humorizing that situation. Some might call the play over-the-top, but they're just missing the humor of it all. I've read a lot of plays, and this is definitely one of the best modern plays out there. Everything about it screams &quot;wit.&quot; The characters are great, and memorable too. If you have the chance to buy it, don't miss it!	2000-09-29

I've read over half of Shakespeare's plays, and Much Ado About Nothing is by far my favorite. Shakespeare not only weaves a clever tale of love and wit, he produces a villain, Don John, who rivals only Iago in evil. Benedick and Beatrice of course steal the show, but the true romantic can't help feeling the love between Claudio and Hero. A true masterpiece!<br />If you don't have time to read the play, I highly recommend the recent movie version starring Kenneth Branagh as Benedick and Denzel Washington as Don Pedro. It cuts a few too many lines, but it's the only version of Much Ado that seems to come close to the happy-go-lucky tone that Shakespeare probably intended. Kenneth Branagh at is at his best.	2000-09-29

Some of the chapters seem to contradict one another, like &quot;I'm funny, you're sarcastic.&quot; The retorts that Phelps and Austin have come up with ARE sarcastic.<br />Other than that, it is still decently laid out. I like the way there were sections to write in to evaluate yourself. There were also example scenarios of how a woman could handle herself in particular situations. It wasn't quite what I expected it to be, but I'd recommend to a woman with low self-esteem.	2000-09-29

I know it's really shaped how modern plays. But wow... this play is frustrating. It has it's moments, but for a majority the play you just want to bang Didi and Gogo's heads against one another. When I was reading this I couldn't help but wonder what people saw in it. I really had to struggle to get through it. If I hadn't been required to read it for my drama class, I would have tossed it out my 3rd-floor apartment window. Do read it if like me, you're interested in writing plays. But if you're just reading it because a friend was raving how good it was, give it a miss. They're probably just &quot;being&quot; pretentious drama majors who couldn't tell art from a scribble done by a two-year old.	2000-09-29

Never having really discovered what exactly it meant to be Armenian, Arlen actually travels there, in search of his roots. My favorite part of this book was how masterful Arlen is at weaving in history with personal experience. Nobody wants to sit and read a textbook; Passage to Ararat is a pleasant read, particularly how it reads so much like a novel. Anyone wanting to try to understand more about the Genocide should get this book, or for those searching for their &quot;inner Armenian.&quot; Arlen takes you on his version of the journey. Get a copy before it goes out-of-print!	2000-09-27

Just recently, I came across it at a garage sale and decided to give it another go. Paulsen is incredible! Everything he does is great; he really heightens his reader's awareness, an important thing to do when you're writing for children. There are a couple scenes I found a bit disturbing (ie. seeing pilot having a heart attack, kid seeing pilots face after it had been eaten away at by fish), so I'd have to say this book is more appropriate for older children. In any case, it's a wonderful read and will have your child wondering if he or she could make it in a similar situation.	2000-09-27

Hartunian is a superb writer and takes the reader in (like all the greats can do) so that they feel like they're there. His vocabulary drills a permanent picture into the reader's mind. I still have images of how terrifying it must have been to be in Hartunian's shoes, present in Turkey between 1915-1923, chased by the ruthless Turks. This is a definite must have for anyone researching the Genocide or for someone who just wants to learn more about it. A great piece for your collection.	2000-09-27

I used this book, coupled with some dry, boring, pretentious linguistics book, in my Anthropology class &quot;Language and Culture.&quot; Goshgarian did a wonderful job putting it together. It would be a great tool for any student of sociolinguistics. Some of the books for sociolinguistics have forgotten who they're writing to; they try so hard to sound intelligent and end up making themselves look foolish when nobody understands. This book however, completely avoids that. Goshgarian should be applauded for this work. I can't wait for the next edition to come out!	2000-09-27

I just can't say enough good things about this book. The pictures are fabulous--I'd pay the price of the book for them alone! And for those  curious about stage production and screenplays, this book is a MUST HAVE!  Much Ado is definitely my favorite play by Shakespeare.
