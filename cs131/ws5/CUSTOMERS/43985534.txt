The start of this book begins with a legend, the telling of a tale of a creature that assimilated into society and became what is known to them as \\"others\\" (which are human) the back story is important so do not skip. They live known as Chasen it is a shire (of sorts) and none of them are allowed to leave it, they are after all not human and tend to keep to themselves only going out into the \\"others world\\" when necessary and to keep the suspicion down. They also from time to time have situations where someone does escape the shire, these people are referred to as {{runners}}} it is the job of the council (and namely Kit) to track down these \\"Drakons\\" and return them to the shire where they are dealt with by the council. \\"Drakon\\" can also sense each other, their power and energy, because they are creatures they can not have living livestock around as the animals sense their presence (don't forget they are also hunters) and react accordingly, hence they have no animals roaming free in the shire. Their \\"other\\" appearance is almost fairy-like meaning they are beautiful as humans.<br /><br />Kit (Christopher) is the Hero and the heir to his \\"kind\\" he is strong and VERY VERY Alpha male over the lapse of time there hasn't been a female \\"Drakon\\" born to them for centuries which has the council concerned and almost desperate. Clarissa (Rue) is a half-ling she is half human and half \\"Drakon\\" she is considered and treated as a outcast because of this growing up in the shire has not been easy on her, you can imagine that like all other women in the shire she has loved the \\"soon-to-be-someday\\" leader of their tribe from a far for as long as she can remember. On Clarissa 17th birthday she \\"turns\\" and discovers that's she is indeed the one and only ALPHA FEMALE. Time passes and the story skips ahead to a thief in London that disappears into thin air and the tabloids are having a field day with it because this thief has stolen several times and never has anyone REALLY seen this culprit of course the \\"Drakon\\" who keeps watchful eyes out sees the story knows that it is one of their own a decision is made to bait the thief out.<br /><br />The \\"Drakon\\" has a treasure (which is described in detail in the prologue) that is the \\"heart\\" of their existence it is a Purple diamond this diamond is kept deep, deep in the Earth back in Chasen, but is known as the \\"Langford Jewel\\" all around the world. A decision is made to bring this diamond to London to be put on display at a museum ... a bait to lure the thief out. Clarissa is a master of disguises she does attend the museum exhibit Kit senses her (but doesn't realize that the person whom they are seeking is a female).<br /><br />I won't say much more than this don't want to give away spoilers :) but I will say this..... The story is full of EVERYTHING that appeals to a romance reader Kit is sexy, has a sense of humor, smart and protective of Rue. Rue is beautiful, witty, strong (she can fence) and a compliment to Kit's ALPHA MALE. Science Fiction/Fantasy readers will like it simply because of the different element of the supernatural fans of {{{Christine Feehan, Linda K. Hamilton, Kelley Armstrong, Sherrilyn Kenyon and Donna Boyd}}} shouldn't be disappointed either. Rue is like what Elena is to the werewolf community in the Kelley Armstrong \\"Women of the Otherworld Series\\" , Kit is very much so like the Carpathian men in the Christine Feehan \\"Dark Series\\" or the men in the \\"Dark-Hunter Series\\" of Kenyon. The experience and thrill of being a \\"Drakon\\" is very reminiscent  of the \\"passion\\" in the Donna Boyd \\"Werewolf\\" books. Ms. Abe wrote such a good book that I long to go back to the pages and re-read as if it was my first time again about Rue and Kit, if you are new to Ms. Abe's writing I would also recommend checking out her \\"The Last Mermaid\\" very well written and a definitely and different twist on the whole mermaid folklore.<br /><br />Respectfully Reviewedulprit of course the \\"Drakon\\" who keeps watchful eyes out sees the story knows that it is one of their own a decision is made to bait the thief out.  <br /> <br />The \\"Drakon\\" has a treasure (which is described in detail in the prologue) that is the \\"heart\\" of their existence it is a Purple diamond this diamond is kept deep, deep in the Earth back in Chasen, but is known as the \\"Langford Jewel\\" all around the world.

But when he galloped off afterwards without any promises to rescue her, the deceived senorita vowed she'll get back at the double-crosser -- even if it meant never savoring his lying lips again!<br /><br />TOO LUSCIOUS TO BE LAWFUL<br /><br />Rangy, rugged Bandit knew how to hold his cards, his liquor and his women, but when he first met the alluring Mexican maiden, he knew this was one gal he shouldn't touch! She was too young, too innocent, and too rich for a no-good mixed-blood cowboy like himself. Still, he couldn't stop his mouth from crushing hers any more than he could keep a stallion from a mare. And after he'd tasted and teased her, and pleasured and pleased her, it was too late to tell Amethyst he was on the run -- and he could never again shelter her in his BANDIT'S EMBRACE...	2005-05-20

He has many outstanding commissions all over Rome that he is running behind in and Michelangelo and his prot&eacute;g&eacute; Sebastiano are constantly on his heels with envy and jealousy. He is in need of a muse he finds that in Margherita. At first she declines the offer to be his model because it is well known that Raphael is a philanderer and more times than not seduces his models she has a higher image of herself (her mother's influence) and does not want THAT for herself. Of course as in all romance novels the chase for Raphael is more intense because she will not agree to become his model. After he repeatedly offers money, comes to her father's bakery sends her a (respectful) piece of art -- so that she is able to understand he just wants her to model for him ONLY she agrees. Raphael is engaged to a Cardinals niece so there is a lot of political pressure on him constantly not only to complete his commissions but to honor his betrothal. Time goes by he becomes obsessed with her, they fall in love he desperately tries to get out of the betrothal, his enemies are against them at every turn. This book didn't have a lot of detail about their surroundings as you normally find in a romance novel much of the book took place at 4 locations his studio, his home, the bakery and a number of places that he was working on the art. Leonardo Da Vinci makes a few appearance and for the most part Michelangelo is in Florence not in Rome where this book takes place. Raphael becomes so consumed with Margherita that he seems never to pick up the pace when it comes to his commissions I found that frustrating because it was obvious these men didn't want him with her and kept reminding him that she was a distraction to him, I would have thought that he would have made sure to complete his jobs in a timely manner since at every turn they were constantly reminding him of his DUTIES to THEM. Granted you understand that for Raphael SHE became his duty and all else was irrelevant to him....<br /><br />Diane H. is unquestionably one of the most gifted writers of Historical Romance Fiction out there. Her books are so involving that after you read the pages you still fill like there is more to learn of the individuals in the story. I should know because after reading this book I did some research of my own on the web regarding Raphael as well as Margherita to see what she really looked like in all of the paintings. The one thing that I realize in reading nearly most of Diane books is that very rarely is there a Happy Ending... but since largely what she writes is actual Historical events the reader has to understand that's the way it is, no matter how much \\"filler\\" she puts in it she always brings it back to the factual ending. I also recommend if you like this type of tale \\"The Girl with the pearl Earring\\" (a fictitious story inspired by a real work of art) or even perhaps the movie \\"The Kings Whore\\" starring Timothy Dalton and Valarie Golino (the story of a woman that unwillingly gains the attraction of a King and becomes the love of his life - everyone including family and her husband telling her she MUST become his mistress).<br /><br />Respectfully Reviewedranted you understand that for Raphael SHE became his duty and all else was irrelevant to him....  <br /> <br />Diane H. is unquestionably one of the most gifted writers of Historical Romance Fiction out there.

On to my review...<br /><br />Again I am plaqued by the fact that EVERY supernatural man in this book is attracted to and WANTS Sookie she in turn has been kissing on everyone of these men that seems to show some interest with the exception of 2. 2 out of 6 is not a good ratio in my book LOL I am confused as to where her heart lies. At the beginning you think they are going to do something with the whole Jason thing but they don't they address it once or twice in the book and that's it. This one was kind of sort of all over the place from Alcid's Dad fighting for Alpha Male Werewolf and how is this got ANYTHING to do with Sookie is beyond me, Lily Bard (from Charlaine Harris other series) shows up to investigate with her friend/mentor/lover regarding Debbie's death (which BTW is never really laid to rest) There is something going on with a debt Eric owes and somehow this is tied into what has been going on in Bon Temps there is a killer of \\"were\\" people on the loose and that is tied to the bar.<br /><br />URGHHHH!!! I just was dissapointed because the story didn't have me engaged I didn't care about it I wanted to hear about Bill and Sookie or Eric and Sookie and how that whole thing was going to work out. So if I'm not going to get satisfied with Eric/Bill/Sookie love triangle then give me a story line that is plausible and not 5 different storylines that weren't strong it just felt like the plots were empty fillers, that really didn't jibe.<br /><br />What I did get was Alcid and Sookie thrown in there and then Sam and Sookie to add to the flavor, to befuddle me Charles and Sookie and top it off Quinn and Sookie. In this it reminded me of the direction of {{{Laurell K. Hamilton Anita Blake Series}}}although without all the raunchy sex.

This is my first Vampire book, I don't generally read gore but suprisingly enough it doesn't contain a lot of it. Descriptive fight scenes, gun battles, creatures of all kinds and &quot;sort of&quot; love story is what this quick read had to offer. I am not a Science Fiction professional reader so my review is actually coming from someone that is new to this genre it seems to me that Laurell K. Hamilton tried to mesh the world of Romance with Science Fiction and she did it (in my honest opinion) rather smoothly, don't get me wrong there is a slight reference of a &quot;possible&quot; attraction between 2 characters (sorry no spoilers here) but there isn't a lot of romance going on. The suspense is within the murders that are going on and the potrayal of the Nickolaus character (who reminded me a lot of the Kristin Durst role in &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot;)will haunt me for a day or two I am sure. The one thing that I was a little perplexed about was how did Anita develop some of her skills... but I do have faith a figure that these may be revealed in later books so I look forward to delving into the rest of the series.<br />I highly recommend this series if you are a Romantic Supsense Reader that needs a break from the &quot;norm&quot;.

This is book #3 in the {{BRIDES OF VIRTUE}} series but I do not think this is a series you have to read in order. In fact this is the first one I read. This book is for the Epicureans Romance Readers out there and more. BK certainly did her share of research for the culinary delights in this story. Being as my occupation is Director of Catering I always like to read books with Food in the storyline this one does not dissapoint.<br />Julia is a young women who has been in the convent since the age of 10. She has always been headstrong and independent, not really the attributes one would equate to a Nun in Medieval times, the Head Abbess assigns Julia into the Kitchen at a early age to keep her out of making trouble in the convent. Julia takes to the Kitchen like a &quot;duck-to-water&quot; becomes irreplaceable. One evening (during very bad weather) 2 knights traveling through the area stop at the convent to get something to eat (after being told in the nearby village that they will find exceptional faire there) well of course they have a dinner TO DIE FOR and unbeknownst to the Abbess these 2 knights Count has a peculiar ailment............ He has a uncanny disability to pick up every scent there is GOOD AND BAD and he becomes so overwhelmed that it makes him deranged hence he is named &quot;THE BEAST&quot;. Because of this ailment he can not enjoy food especially food made from awful cooks that don't know what flavors compliment each other. So when they come upon this convent with Food OUT OF THIS WORLD they try to find out who the cook is, the Abbess knows she has a treasure in her cook so she doesn't allow them to meet Julia. The 2 Knights go away not knowing who the cook is but they are fairly tripping over themselves to return to the Count to tell him of their find. I don't want to get to lengthy about the book description since the 2 previous reviews (as well as Amazon synopsis) does a fine job in telling what the story is about.<br />When you get down to it I ENJOYED this book there is humor, betrayal, mystery, a feud, the physical attraction is sensual...... all the things that makes reading Historical Romances so lively. Griffin and Julia are a good couple to watch come to their feelings. BK does a excellent job in describing each meal in such detail that you can just taste the buttery crust in Julia's tarts and pasties. Griffin's ailment is rather interesting and I could say the same for the way Julia learns to get around it.

Eric does have amnesia and Jason is missing throw in some witches and other supernatural creatures and YES it does begin to feel like {{Anita Blake}} this book is mainly about Sookie helping Eric while Bill is out of town in Peru, for those of you out there that like Bill I can't say more than that(without giving away spoilers).

You see Mandy has a history of sabotaging Marian's love interest, then she follows it up with crapping on the fellow in the end and leaving them. So Marian puts on this disguise to hide her beauty so that no one will be interested in her, and no one will get their feelings hurt.

The book starts out as Stephan is a young child being fostered by (more like political hostage) the King of England while he is there he meets 3 other individuals 1st being Duncan, a young boy (who's father is the King of Scotland) is also being held. 2nd being Prince Rufus (who will later become King) and Rufus has a like of men, 3rd being Prince Henry who is brother to Rufus and of course, resents his older brother.<br />Stephen while traveling home is wounded and his men rest in a forest, our heroine Mary (Princess of Scotland) is in disguise and on her way to meet her betrothed for a tryst. She is captured and brought to Stephen he asks her repeatedly who she is because even though she is in disguise he know she must be a noblewoman. His Lust for her overcomes his rational behavior and he beds her... of course this back fires on him. He is already betrothed to someone else (a marriage approved and selected by the King himself)the King HATES Mary's father (the King of Scotland) and her father HATES (with a passion) King Rufus. This sends the story into some very interesting political turmoil at court which includes Stephen's father \\"Rolfe\\" in the story.<br />The story was long but I could not put it down. Mary is stubborn and very young (which was a norm for the writing style for when this book was written) she does some stupid things in the course of her relationship with Stephen. She is torn between her naive perception of her Father, her loyalty to Scotland, her growing LUST/LOVE for Stephen and last but not least her own head strong ways.<br />Stephen is no better, he has issues with the King that he never shares with anyone (accept the readers.. if you get what I mean), doesn't trust Mary-exiles her, hits her (although only once), has sexual relations outside of their marriage and goes to war on her family (Kings orders). Geoffrey is Stephen's brother he has a pivotal part in this book too, and I actually found his part more exciting and interesting. He is sexy, virile and sounds gorgeous like his father Rolfe.. but Geoffrey is to be a priest, in fact he is already in the order so you can imagine his story would be a bit more fascinating to watch. His struggle with Religion and his bodies natural \\"urges\\" LOL<br />You also get to see Ceidre, from \\"The Conqueror\\", Stephens mother again as well as her and Rolfe's other children.<br />Brenda Joyce always does a Outstanding job at keeping her history 90% accurate and when she strays she has a disclosure at the end of the book. Book does show \\"Rufus the Red\\" in a strange and sort of pathetic light. I couldn't figure out if I liked Henry or not there were times when he seemed okay and others were you weren't for certain whose interest he was taking care of.<br />This book has political espionage, incest, murder attempts, homosexuality, the church  vs. the crown, betrayal (or was it?) a satisfying read for anyone who likes books and storylines from this time span and written in the 80's. I must also recommend over this one {KINGDOM OF DREAMS} written by Judith McKnaught pretty much almost the same identical story lines but in my opinion more of a fulfilling read... and yes JM's was written first.<br />Respectfully Reviewedt the readers.. if you get what I mean), doesn't trust Mary-exiles her, hits her (although only once), has sexual relations outside of their marriage and goes to war on her family (Kings orders).

Was told that this was a excellent book and I dove into it with enthusiasm. Boy was I dissapointed. :(<br />First of all the story is a sad one 2 people that have loved each other their whole lives, were married for 10 years, and due to the Heroines {Christina} inability to carry and birth an heir, this union of 2 soul mates were seperated. Varek, our hero is obsessed with Christina... in fact I can safely say that this feeling was mutual (in some regard) I am not like other reviewers that found this kind of love unhealthy, I just think that what they shared was DEEP.<br />What I did not like about this book was the inconsistency and the flow.... the present husband was uneven, the story was all over the place, Christina's attitude towards her husband was ridiculous (seeing as she was less than honest with him... she was pissed off at her Present husbands reactions to Varek) and last but not least the ending.... OH MY GOSH!... without giving away spoilers that is about all I can say other than the fact that they ended it very poorly. The author never explains something at the end of this book which literally leaves you hanging.... it is as if she was told to wrap up the story immediatly and that is just what she did.<br />I'm disheartened because I really felt the love between Christina and Varek, I did get the feeling that they were as one, but all of those emotions were overuled because other things in the book just didn't flow right. I recommend reading this book if you are the type of person that can read a book and not criticize grammer errors (I found a few), not expect the flow in the book to always make sense and can be okay with a ending that ends happy but not necessarily answer all the questions.<br />I'm off to read her latest one \\"While You Slept\\" and hopefully it is much better than this one.<br />Respectfully Reviewed	2003-04-24

Anyone just discovering JM probably would not find any fault in this one..... I believe some of her \\"true-blue\\" fans have probably waited so long that they would be happy with anything written from her pen. I on the other hand am not. I've been a fan of Ms. McKnaught for years (own every last book she has ever written) I LOVE her historicals and straddle the fence with her contemporary's (although I must say I like her older contemporary's better)but Man oh Man did I expect better and my goodness the book is HUGEEEE!!!! (a lot of wasted paper if you ask me)<br />Why is it that in mainly all of her books the main characters are BEYOND Rich? I mean ridiculously so...  Anyhoo on to my review. First of all the story seemed disjointed to me there were flashbacks that really didn't pull the story together. You never really get to understand (in my opinion) what real type of relationship the Heroine had with her Husband. Then JM throws in this \\"conspiracy\\" plot (you'll know what I'm talking about when/and if you read the book) that had me by the end of the book asking myself \\"WAS THERE A NEED TO PUT THAT IN THERE?\\" I can't tell spoilers when I do a review, but BOY do I wish I could go into detail about this thing that irked me.<br />The Hero, again was a \\"rags to riches\\" type guy (classic JM) who of course knew the Heroine from long ago and was in love with her way back when, but had to put himself together before he could enter into her life.... Sounds familiar huh? I truly wish that some of these Authors could change up their plots, just so you don't see it coming. The Heroine had no idea about her husband's life but she had been married for some time to this guy and about the only thing I did like about this book was the presence of Courtney Maitland (sister of Noah Maitland) from \\"Night Whispers\\" and Joe (the chauffer for Meredith and Matt) from \\"Paradise\\".<br />If you can wait for it on paperback I encourage you to do so or wait until the price goes down because had I spent the retail  price I would be upset.

Hamilton and it dealt a lot with Were-people and this was a welcome diversion.<br />This book started out so engaging it got me from the first chapter and kept me. The whole premise is that there are 3 gifted students at the House of Ra, when these 3 students combine their magical energy their power is unmatched, however something happens early on and they do not complete the training they needed. Consequently their magic is flawed.... but they don't realize that, their young and think they are invicible.<br />This book has Magicians that are immortal, Dark Magic that goes wrong, Incest, Betrayal and all of this spans from the time during Pharoah to the present day.

This is one of her earlier ones and is not a reflection of her writing skills today. I found it to be weird because the whole \\"curtain\\" thing was never really explained thoroughly enough for me... and the whole idea that raping a Female Wizard was a way to gain her powers was a bit ridiculous and bad taste for a story line yes, I know this is fiction but I still had a problem with that.<br />Maybe it was me that I was thoroughly confused about the War between the Female Wizards and the Male Wizards, then the ending was a little strange too.

I'm not much of a Supernatural/Paranormal reader I tend to stick to the Romance/Contemporary Suspense genre (just take a look at my other reviews and listmania lists)but I thoroughly was engrossed into this story.... and that's what this is a wonderful, fascinating, sweeping tale, of a friendship between a human and a werewolf/man. This book takes an incredible look at what we humans have as a downfall (according to the werewolves) our emotions. Jealousy and deception leads this family into peril and harsh consequences that has a rippling effect into the future.<br /><br />The first part of the book is in present day New York City the Devoncroix family is the Royal family to the Werewolf nation. Nicholas (the son) and Alexander (the father) discover a massacre has taken place at one of their Labs. Because of the nature of the killings they try to figure out if the killer/s were/are Human or of their kind.... At first sight it appears to be humans but at closer look it is more than that. So begins the tale of Alexander telling his son a secret into the history of their family.<br /><br />In the 1800's humans are immensely disliked by the Pack and Alexander is viewed as &#34;eccentric&#34; because he is known to socialize quite frequently with humans, he takes Tessa (a human) under his wing. Tessa is annoyingly human, through the eyes of the werewolves, it's understandable to envision why they dislike us so much, she ask to many questions, disobeys orders and can not/will not grasp the fact that she would never understand the world in which Alexander lives in. Tessa is a young woman who falls in love with Alexander, who is described as being a beautiful and sensual Man (what woman would not?) Alexander views Tessa as a pet of some sorts, Elise is the new Queen of the &#34;Pack&#34; she too befriends Tessa and makes a stand to the Werewolf nation that as she comes into the seat as the Queen she wants it known that she is of like mind that Werewolves and Humans need to coexist for the future of their pack. Denis is the brother of Alexander who is of the original Werewolf pack &#34;Antonov&#34; he lives in Siberia and does not embrace the notion of living in &#34;harmony&#34; with humans and heads up a outlaw group of Werewolves called the &#34;Brotherhood&#34; they are Human-haters. His part in this book is woven in so well that long after you put this book down you won't know quite how to feel about Denis.... or at least I don't. Through Denis actions comes betrayal and a forbidden line being crossed.<br /><br />The author takes you back in time to the 1800's from the beauty of France, to the magical description of Siberia, to the cold hard wilderness life of Alaska. The visual imagination in this tale was so real to me that I could literally feel the ice under my feet as the author described what is was like for Alexander and Denis to be in wolf form. &#34;The Passion&#34; is in reference to the actual transition from a Human Form into that of the Wolf form. This is not a Heavy romance book I would say that 90% of this book is Historical and parts of it are written from Alexander's point of view and a few from Tessa and Denis. This also does not have a &#34;happy ending&#34; that you find in Romance novels it leads into her next book &#34;The Promise&#34; which I would like to pick up as soon as I can find it.

Since Amazon for some reason or another has no plot description for this book. I will recite what is on the back of my copy.<br />DESCRIPTION:<br />Darci Monroe overcame a childhood of neglect with an ebullient spirit, a positive attitude...and extraordinary determination. Now the resourceful young woman, hired as Adam Montgomery's personal assistant, devotes more than just professional attention to this devastatingly handsome millionaire. But one thing bars Adam from accepting Darci's love: he is intent on discovering the secret of his parent's dissapearence, for she possesses the otherwordly abilities needed to help him fight a terrifying mistress of the dark arts. What Darci ends up offering is a gift greater than Adam ever hoped for, for Darci loves with all her heart, and all her soul, forever...<br />MY REVIEW:<br />Had me from the first page. Adam is a Montgomery, and to those of us that are fans of Ms. Deveraux books we are well acquainted with the power and appeal of this family name. Darci is quirky, has a sense of humor and at times reminded me of a Garwood heroine. There is some supernatural hocus pocus in this tale, the growth of a love between 2 people that were meant to be together and a reconcilation of more than 1 family.<br />Deveraux has a nack of pulling all things together that I appreciate, there are times in this book that I was getting frustrated about Darci's \\"True Persuasion\\" but by the end of the book the explanation made sense. For those of us that love seeing the Montgomery clan in action.... have no fear Ms. Deveraux brings in a bit of it in this book, with a mention here and there of the \\"Taggerts\\" as well. Overall I enjoyed this book and could not put it down it did not slow down but actually picked up. Darci had a \\"odd\\" childhood she lives with relatives that pretty much do not want her around. Her mother is a non-existant person in this book and you get the idea that Darci's relationship with her mother is not a good one. Adam lost his family at a early age and is search for what happened to them.<br />When the book begins I suggest you take close attention to the story that is being told because it holds great relevance to the latter part of this book.  All in all this book was a fast read. If you like this review I suggest you check out some of my other reviews I happen to enjoy Ms. Deveraux writing and recommend that the reader read take a look at some of her earlier books that explains the beginning of this Montgomery Clan.

Not very honorable but in the course of the book they give it a \\"honorable\\" twist..... which I still don't find it to be to decent. Anyhoo take a look at the book, I'm hoping this is one of those that she decides to go back and redo, like so many other authors are doing these days.<br />Respectfully Reviewed	2002-09-30

As a Director of Catering I collect a lot of cookbooks. In fact if you like this review you might want to check out my listmania list I have several on cookbooks.<br />Now to my review. This book, in my opinion, is Beautifully put together. Recipes are easy to read with items that are accesible at most grocery stores. The stories throughout the books and little articles that in reference to the series was a excellent idea. This book had so many different little added extras that it was hard for me to remember that this was a fictional family they were speaking of LOL. I especially like the page of top 10 Famous Food scenes in Mob movies it was interesting. The book has recipes from Appetizers to Desserts. No Fuss to a little Elaborate. Pictures are nice and I had the feeling, after reading this book, that I could do many of these recipes even if I wasn't a Director of Catering.<br />I highly recommend this book for anyone that enjoys Italian Food or the Series, in fact I had an idea to do a Gift Basket for Christmas with the DVD's (from the series), this Cookbook, a Sinatra CD and a bottle of Ruffino Chiante what a perfect evening.<br />If you find that you like this style of cookbook, ethnic or because it tells a story along with the recipes also check<br />Van Gogh's Table (the artist life story is throughout the book), and Soul Food: Recipes & Reflections from African-American Churches by Joyce White<br />Respectfully Reviewed	2002-09-26

The premise/plot you can read up top but the gist is if you can stomache how Rogan is in the beginning of the book you will enjoy it I believe.

I'd been meaning to read this book for some time since it has been in my TBR (to be read)pile for sometime and I had heard from many different sources that this was a worth while read. I recommend that if you read the reviews on here still take a chance and read the book, I read the reviews and thought to myself it was going to be awful, but was pleasently suprised. I did not give this one a high rating because the end [was diasappointing], the plausibility of the whole Family [thing stunk]and the relationship did progress incredibly quick for someone who had been sheltered from men since she was 18 years old and then suddenly after 2 weeks of knowing someone feels so comfortable with them, to accept a proposal?????<br />The end had so many ludicrous twist and turns it was like OH COME ON NOW!!!!! (NO SPOILERS HERE) but when you read the book you'll understand EXACTLY what I am referring to. It was a fast read and one that I didn't actually won't to put down because of the mystery that was going on but still I really just HATED the last 3 or so chapters.

I read this book after reading a review on here by one of my fellow reviewers and it had the elements that I look for you know the Hero that \\"thinks\\" he wants a certain type of female, the \\"Heroine\\" that does not fit this \\"type\\" that the Hero is looking for, the attraction between the two despite these obstacles, mischievous children and meddling elders.<br />I really enjoyed this book. So why not give it the 5 stars.. hmmm well I think that when you give a book 5 stars it should have no holes or inconsistency between characters, the book should grab you from go and hold you enthralled the ENTIRE time.. like one that you would pull a all nighter for. This wasn't that sort of tale. It might well have been had I read the \\"The Seduction of Sara\\" first which is the book before this one. I have since picked that one up to read. There is a lot of emphasis on the bad element of the \\"Ellliot\\" name so I'm thinking (and hoping) that reading the 1st book will explain that whole premise because if not, there lies the first hole in this tale. The Heroine does a really good job at thwarting the Hero's seduction which I really liked and the Hero does have ample enough time to struggle with the attraction that he can not understand.<br />I have to say that the little conversations at the beginning of each chapter reminded me a lot of Julia Quinn's style, kind of like the little blurbs by Miss Whistledown. All in all I think most will enjoy this book it was funny, sexy and entertaining.<br />Respectfully Reviewed	2002-09-03

This is my first Vampire book, I don't generally read gore but suprisingly enough it doesn't contain a lot of it. Descriptive fight scenes, gun battles, creatures of all kinds and &quot;sort of&quot; love story is what this quick read had to offer. I am not a Science Fiction professional reader so my review is actually coming from someone that is new to this genre it seems to me that Laurell K. Hamilton tried to mesh the world of Romance with Science Fiction and she did it (in my honest opinion) rather smoothly, don't get me wrong there is a slight reference of a &quot;possible&quot; attraction between 2 characters (sorry no spoilers here) but there isn't a lot of romance going on. The suspense is within the murders that are going on and the potrayal of the Nickolaus character (who reminded me a lot of the Kristin Durst role in &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot;)will haunt me for a day or two I am sure. The one thing that I was a little perplexed about was how did Anita develop some of her skills... but I do have faith a figure that these may be revealed in later books so I look forward to delving into the rest of the series.<br />I highly recommend this series if you are a Romantic Supsense Reader that needs a break from the &quot;norm&quot;.<br />Respectfully Reviewed	2002-08-21

The story of the children after that was like watching a 70's Night Time Soap Opera. I guess if you are trying to find this authors back list then it would be worth it. I'm sure that it sticks out in readers mind for those who read it when it first came out, had a very international vibe and the prerequisite climatic end.

I am currently trying to read all of my TBR (to be read) of Lavryle Spencer, since this lady has went into retirement I have to savor her books slowly.  Morning Glory was like most of her books vivid in detail of that time period, it takes place in Georgia. The Heroine &quot;Elly&quot; was raised by grandparents that were religious zealots and kept her locked up in a house without any sunlight allowed in (mainly to keep people out) but &quot;Elly&quot; did manage to go to school (thanks to local law enforcement) so she did have some exposure to the outside world. Unfortunatly because of the way she lived the kids at school teased her and she got the name &quot;Crazy Elly&quot;. She has 2 little boys and another child on the way and doesn't go into town because of her childhood ridicule.<br />The Hero &quot;Will&quot; is a ex-convict, a drifter and doesn't know who his parents were/are. They come together after &quot;Will&quot; loses his job at the local sawmill. &quot;Elly&quot; is moving along in her pregnancy and realizes that she can not continue without help, so she places a ad in the local paper looking for a &quot;Husband&quot; really she needs someone to help around the Farm and with raising her sons. &quot;Will&quot; answers the ad after losing the Job and thinking he doesn't have anything more to loose. Of course in Spencer fashion these two develop a Love that touches your heart and you see &quot;Will&quot; become a better man because of &quot;Elly&quot;. I don't want to give to much of the story away but this story is during the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor and &quot;Will&quot; ends up serving in the War there are some circumstance which arise that forces &quot;Elly&quot; to come out of her shell and become more involved in the community.<br />Overall I liked the book, I only gave it 4 Stars because there are others of Ms. Spencer that I would definately recommend over this one. If you like this particular type of storyline I would also recommend &quot;The Outsider&quot; by Penelope Williamson or &quot;A Pocketful of Paradise&quot; by Kathleen Kane<br />Happy Reading&quot;The Outsider&quot; by Penelope Williamson or &quot;A Pocketful of Paradise&quot; by Kathleen Kane<br />Happy Reading	2002-07-30

((smile))Penelope we have watch grow from the earlier books and I must say I rather enjoyed how JQ allowed Penelope to mature and become comfortable in her status as a &quot;spinster&quot; but I also must point out that she has quite a back bone and &quot;knows&quot; what she wants she isn't afraid to do (or say something) that isn't acceptable by society standards. Colin is still quite the charming debonair gentleman but I felt like he lacked somehting and I can't quite put my finger on it.<br />There is witty dialogue that you have come to associate with Ms. Quinns work and you do get to see your favorite old characters return. I absolutely adore &quot;Violet&quot; the Mother of all of these Bridgerton's and Lady Danbury becomes quite endearing in this tale. I won't say much about the plot because that would spoil the anticipation. I will say that there are displays of friendship in this book that I found quite endearing and had to wipe a tear or 2 from my eyes, (sigh) Eloise has something up her sleeve that I think shall be revealed in the next Bridgerton book coming out in 2003. I think there are only 2 siblings left in the aphabetical order to be married off, it seems that JQ had 2 of them taken care of without writing their stories LOL anyhoo so we just have Hyacinth and Eloise to look forward to.<br />Overall I liked this book I can't say I had a lot of &quot;Laugh Out Loud&quot; moments as I did with &quot;The Viscount Who Loved Me&quot; or some of her earlier books but I do think that it's worth the time and appreciate her efforts.

TRUE DESCRIPTION OF BOOK: A DISTANT PAST; Kristine Gavin was depressed about turning thirty until she received a most unusual gift from her brother. It was a portrait he'd found in the attic of their family home in Virginia, a portrait of a woman who must have been their ancestor; judging from Kris' resemblance to the beauty. But it wasn't the painting that intrigued Kris....And old newspaper clipping about the woman's strange disappearance caught within the frame drew her in. Just as Kris was uncovering a fascinating secret from the past she sensed a change in the air-and found herself thrown back in time into a strange room, staring into the eyes of the sexiest man she had ever seen!<br />AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE; Sean O'Mara froze when he saw his wife Christia standing before him. She had vanished and the news had written about in all of the papers-he had been charged with her murder!<br />MY REVIEW: I liked it... it started out to be very interesting and continued for the most part to carry it's worth. I realized that this book was one of THE 1st Time Travel books that were written and I read it as such. If you have the opportunity to get your hands on this one please do, it doesn't have a lot of humor but Kris is smart and makes the most of her situation (you'll understand this comment better once you read the book) What I didn't like was the time spent in his time is so short.... I would have rather had her time there be longer and not so much time spent in present day. Overall a good read I don't know if I would consider it a \\"keeper\\" though.	2002-07-05

His actions causes her to loose her job (as a governess)and she ultimatly becomes the governess for his 2 children. Their romance went along at a gradual pace, there is &quot;some&quot; humor in this book, there is of course a vilian and a mystery to be solved: #1 What happened to the Deceased Wife, #2 Lady Anne's treasure and #3 Why does she look so much like the Deceased Wife.<br />I gave this book 3 stars because it wasn't good enough to be considered a &quot;keeper&quot; it is one of those that if I needed room in my book library I would have no hesitation to giving this one up for another. If you are new to romance you will probably enjoy this one because of the unusual storyline as well as the mystery that they threw in.

Well I actually read this one after I had read &quot;To Have and To Hold&quot; and I think I preferred the story of the 2nd book better. Gaffney does seem to have a knack of unusual storylines for romances.<br />Anne is a very &quot;hard to like&quot; heroine IMO. Her views on life, religion, marriage is a bit jaded and cynical. Christy is very likable, being the Honest-to-the-bone Vicar. Be prepared for a book that does not fit the honey sweetness of your typical romance novels. Anne is a married woman, married to Christy's long time best friend (although he and Christy have not spoken for years). There are some strange circumstances around their marriage which is revealed in the book but it is left up to the reader how such a condition came about......<br />I like the fact that Anne eventually becomes less cynical and I love the fact that Christy didn't betray his beliefs to have her. That all ways works out better in romance if this can be achieved. I would recommend reading these books in order though, this being the first. So you can see how Ms. Gaffney sets up the different people in this cozy village.<br />Happy Reading	2002-06-04

Ms. Putneys female characters are in no ways shy or demure about there sensuality. So if that is what you like in Historical Romance BUYER BEWARE. It is not done like say Betrice Small's Heroines. It is more like they are not afraid of sex or there wants but embraces it.<br />This one was harder to get through than \\"The Wild Child\\" Very Interesting storyline. Heroine (Troth)is unique, Hero (Kyle) is.... just there. I read \\"The Wild Child\\" first and really enjoyed it if I would have read this one first I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunatly I read them back to back.<br />The description of China was beautiful, the Heroine has so much about her that you must read the book to give her justice. Maybe that is why the Hero in comparison doesn't shine so brightly. Some of the characters show up in this book from \\"The Wild Child\\" which I enjoyed. This is a interracial love story they have to overcome the probability of racial prejudice from Family as well as the ton. On another note I have come to see in this series \\"The Wild Child\\" and \\"The China Bride\\" the Hero is the one that is holding out on the physical part of the relationship trying to do the \\"honorable thing\\" where the female is literally [upset] because she doesn't understand the conventionalism. Both books have heroines that were raised in different society's other than \\"stanch\\" English.

BEWARE SPOILER::: Emily was overally cynical and the romance did not truly evolve until the end of the book, the whole thing with her cousin and how that was worked out as well was a little hokey?????<br />I would recommend reading &quot;Mariana&quot; after this one so you aren't dissapointed sometimes it's hard to appreciate a book when it comes after one that won the &quot;Catherine Cookson&quot; prize.<br />Respectfully Reviewed	2002-04-14

This book was funny, passionate, had a air of danger and the ending made sense. The review before pretty much wrapped up the storyline. I just want to add that I have since bought a lot more of Susan Plunkett books but none of them come close to catching me from page 1 like this one. I have loaned this out to several people since then and they are always pleased. In fact when trying to introduce friends that do not neccesarily read Time Travel books, to the genre this is one of my favorites to let them sink their teeth into.	2002-04-12

I took this book at a leisurely pace because I didn't want to rush it, and it wasn't so engrossing for me at first to have to rush into. I'm glad I did this because this is one that lingers. I read \\"The Shadowy Horses\\" first and can honestly say that I enjoyed this one more, I'm currently reading \\"Splendour Falls\\", which was I believe before \\"Mariana\\", and so far it has me quite intrigued.<br />Ms. Kearsley does justice to both Mariana and Julia. The blend of History and Romance is dare I say it?.... Sweet. I loved the relationship between Julia and her brother. I love the whole \\"soul mate\\" feel in this book. It reminded me of \\"A Knight in Shining Armor\\" by Jude Deveraux although this moved at an entirely different pace and the ending brought tears to my eyes. This past weekend I found myself picking up this book again and re-reading some parts. It was JUST THAT GOOD.<br />Happy Reading	2002-04-01

I have a Cookbook Library of over 100 books and I can honestly say that I come back to this one more often times than any other. They have lots of pictures and they have the items that you can make at a drop of a hat.<br />One of the things that I do not like about some of the other cookbooks is that some of the items are not easy to get a hold of in your average grocery store and this one is just what it says &quot;BRAND NAME&quot;.<br />Happy Cooking	2002-03-08

I really enjoyed &quot;You and No Other&quot; by CM and thought to check out her back list. I actually had many things that I didn't care for in this book (my own)confusion with Brader mother's husbands the &quot;who&quot; they were, Julia's obession with wanting to have a baby, Julia's past and the &quot;why&quot; Geoffrey the older brother had such a hold on the family and also Julia whole &quot;I'm better than you&quot; attitude.<br />I'm sure it was just me, or at least I'm hoping.

I was beyond HAPPY when I first read this book, so much so that I read it again immediatly after reading it. Jamie reminds me of what I thought, Miles (Velvet Series) should have been like, Axia is the perfect mischevious heroine. If you like some of Julie Garwoods characters you will absolutely ADORE this book. I have to agree with what some other reviewer said it is my favorite Deveraux.<br />I won't go into detail regarding the story line because the editorial reviews does such a fine job and some time you give away to much of the whole plot. I will just say it is well worth the time.<br />Happy Reading	2002-02-28

Nicholoa is one heroine that you adore from the beginning she is witty, beautiful and loyal. Royce is suitable as her champion. Next to &quot;The Secret&quot; this is one of my favorite &quot;Garwoods&quot; The story line starts off with a surprise and keeps you enthralled from then on. Again, I cannot reiterate enough that it is best to read her books in the order of which they came out so that you can see her growth as a writer. A lot of authors since have tried to duplicate &quot;Garwood's&quot; style but she still is the original.<br />Think of 2 worthy opponents that are attracted to one another and throw in that one is sneaky and usually trying to get away with something and you have come up with Nicholoa, Royce shows great patience with her all the while. A must read if you want to get the best of Julie Garwood.<br />Happy Reading	2002-02-27

Ian is described as being sooooo handsome (sigh) and sexy, you literally feel the heat between the two of them coming off of the pages. I too loved her friendship with Mary Francis and the dialogue between the two of them at times had me in stiches. Overall I enjoyed this immensely sometimes it really depends on in which order you read your Garwood books I was lucky to have come early on in her writing career, so I got the benefit of savoring each character as she wrote them ... if you want to read something that makes your \\"heart\\" smile pick this one up it's a treasure... and Thankfully \\"not\\" a SECRET anymore.<br />Happy Reading	2002-02-27

I wanted to savor it one page at a time. I was not dissappointed this story touched me personally because of my own experience with Physical Abuse. I commend Ms. Garwood for tackling an issue that most romances barely touch. I believed in Gabriel, I believed in the strength he brought forth in Johanna. The Love the two of them created was something that little girls dream about and should never STOP reaching for. He was her champion and would allow NO PERSON to dishonor her again. More importantly is that once Johanna was away from those circumstance she wouldn't allow NO ONE to do the same to her. I loved reading about her relationship with his clan and watching it develop. There was a sentence that stood out from this book all these years that I always use to this day.... &quot;Judge me by the Company I keep&quot; when you read this book you will understand what she meant at the time she says it, even now it gives me chills and makes my eyes water. Enjoy this book for what it says about the power of the human spirit, it can be beaten but only broken if you allow it.<br />Happy Reading	2002-02-27

Boy, was I lucky because it was only like... $2.00!!! I actually can't make up my mind if I like this one more than I liked \\"Hot Shot\\" again, this writing style reminded me of earlier \\"Judith Michael\\" books. Definately takes you through time from Fleur childhood to womanhood, her relationship with her mother and her lover. I enjoyed this one and I do highly recommend if you can find it buy it. Someone mentioned in a review also on here that it is a rather dated book. Well it is but if you can keep that in mind while still enjoying the depth and details of the story, you won't be dissatisfied.<br />Happy Reading	2002-02-26

It wasn't worth the wait of over 3 years to find, this is just my opinion. It would have probably appealed to me more if I had read it back in 1985 but it was rather frustrating at times, the heroine and the hero kept doing some things that at times were very nerve wracking. I know that SEP changed some things in it for the new one \\"Just Imagine\\" and I'm hoping that it actually is better than the orignal.	2002-02-26

Read \\"Velvet Promise\\" first so that you know what is going on. I actually read this one first and then found \\"Velvet Promise\\" and I read the series when it first came out in the 80's. I miss the old days of romance where it sweeps you into another world and you get lost in the time I remember visualizing Bronwyn's hair and eyes the first time Stephan saw her, I remember feeling a ache in my stomache when Stephan says the words \\"You will be the Death of Me, Bronwyn\\" (sigh)<br />I can see how some readers of today would not like this sort of writing style but for me who discovered Historical romances through Jude Deveraux and Johanna Lindsay I applaud them still. This one will always remain in my \\"keeper\\" pile no matter how old I get.<br />Happy Reading	2002-02-19

At the time this book was written it was the &quot;norm&quot; for the Hero to be a brute to the Heroine. I fell in love with Judith she was smart, strong and beautiful. I didn't think Gavin deserved her at all but still I loved the way Jude brought this all together.<br />If readers can keep in mind the time that this book was written I think they will enjoy it for what it is.

It was a soulful read, the story was at moments heartbreaking and you sometimes wonder about the intentions of the Hero when he brings the Heroine into his world but the authors wrote this with much respect for the Amish community as well as not taking away from the love that came to be for the Hero and the Heroine. I cannot recommend this one enough, if you are lucky enough to find it... KEEP IT. It was remarkable.

Very reminscent of the SEP books but somewhere along the way I actually wanted to hear the secondary story more (the 2 friends of theirs). I liked the Hero in this one although the story line didn't give them anytime to like each other as people (at least that is the way I felt)<br />I am now on \\"True Confessions\\" and have already picked up the fact that it too has similarities to the other 2 like, the same sexual tension from the very start between the Hero and the Heroine, the fact that the Heroine is starting on a pick-herself-back-up-on-her-feet-again mode yada yada yada. I am hoping that Rachel Gibson throws us for a loop in the next one because I believe she has wonderful talent and dialogue :)Simply Irresistible probably would have appealed better to me had I read this one first I believe, so I must recommend that if someone is starting to read this author pick this one up first and be pleasently surprised.	2002-02-06

I enjoyed this book it was interesting and it reminded me of a &quot;Judith Michael&quot; book so I actually understood the flow of the story with the long absence of romance between the 2 characters. I was lucky enough to have read this book early on in my SEP reading so therefore I wasn't to dissapointed.<br />This book is not &quot;light&quot; and &quot;humorous&quot; as her others but it is a keeper if you like to see an author's growth. She did a tremendous amount of research (you can tell) about the beginning of the Computer age and Silicon Valley which was much appreciated and I think the romance was just thrown in because that was what she writes. All in all not a bad book just not something to pick up if you just finished reading &quot;It Had to Be You&quot; or &quot;Nobody's Baby but Mine&quot; this is a different style all together.<br />Happy Reading	2002-01-31

I started this book at 10:00pm finished it at 3:00am COULD NOT put it down it was a welcome diversion and well worth the lack of sleep today ((smile))<br />The dialogue between Delaney and Nick is one that you just smile and laugh to yourself at moments. Reminds me of the Witty humor of a Cary Grant and Irene Dunne movie. The Sex Scenes are Seductive, Playful and very satisfying. I have had this in my TBR (to be read pile) since 1999 now I guess I'll have to check out the rest of her work. If you LOVE Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum Series you'll enjoy this book. It's light nothing dark and mysterious just a good light read.	2002-01-30

I can't spoil it for some readers but it does get to a point where you don't understand why &quot;Bill&quot; is being so evasive and then you all of sudden get the excuse for it and it is like watching a bad Soap Opera, I could have called that one a mile away. I just wish that some time they (authors, directors) would throw a twist at you that you didn't see coming but makes Perfect, Credible sense.

After reading this I went out and grabbed all of her backlist. This was one of the first books that I had read in the first person, I tend to steer clear from them but I'm glad I didn't with this one.<br />This was one of those books that I couldn't stop laughing about, in the rest room at work, in the Cafeteria at lunch, anywhere I was you could hear me just cracking up over the dialogue and the things Barbara did! I don't recommend this book for anyone looking for a piece of literary genious. I do recommend it if you are in a reading slump and you have had enough of historical sap, graphic murder mysteries or time-travel overload. It was a light read and a unexpected Pleasure.<br />I am currently reading &quot;Name Dropping&quot; and one of the reasons I like it so far is it reminds me of &quot;Infernal Affairs&quot; I'm thoroughly enjoying it. As with all authors I do recommend that you read their backlist first and then work your way up to their current writing style it is important to see the Author's progression some time they get better and then there are times when they get stuck in a rut.<br />If you like Janet Evanovich, Rachel Gibson or Jennifer Cruise I would give Jane a try.	2001-10-02

I couldn't put it down, but it was like watching a inevitable Train Wreck. I was so frustrated at Winter for not learning the &quot;real&quot; truths when she had countless opportunities.<br />This is a heavy read. It chronicles Winter's life from childhood to young adult. Through her writings you get to see Winter's world through not only Winter's eyes but those of the Mom, the friends and her Father's &quot;workers&quot;.<br />I'm not from that background so I can't say that I could relate but it was definately a &quot;eye opener&quot; to some definate materialistic values of those who live in this environment. It was &quot;real&quot;, &quot;raw&quot; and had a message throughout, I just hope that our young people of today pick this up and really &quot;listen and understand&quot; what that message was.	2001-08-06
