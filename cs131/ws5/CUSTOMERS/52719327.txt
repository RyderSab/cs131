I am an evangelical Christian, and I do believe in The Rapture, Tribulation, Throne of Judgment, etc.  I can read these books and recognize that a good portion of them is just the authors' views on how the end times will play out.  There is quite a bit of debate, even among orthodox Christians, about this subject.  It is something Christians can debate without dividing over.  <br />However, the reason that I did not care for this book is that it is just plain dull and poorly written.  The first few books of the series were very good, and they went downhill, to the point that the characters were like cartoons, and the action/adventure like a comic book.  I felt that a fascinating premise was taken and STRETCHED out as far as it would go, in order to make money.  This has turned into a monster franchise, with book series for children, and even a board game!  I am always leary of &quot;trends&quot; and &quot;fads&quot; among Christians (such as the Prayer of Jabez craze a few years ago).  This series could have been much shorter, with fewer characters (surely I'm not the only one who couldn't keep track!)and less repetition.	2004-05-03

Like Mr. Parshall's others in this series, I read this within 24 hours.  The only thing that kept this one from a 5-star is Fiona - she has too many issues and is too insecure!  Otherwise, love the characters and the plot twists!	2004-01-04

HOWEVER, what ruined it for me was how similar it was to A Moment of Weakness.  Two people who were in love as young adolescents, suddenly torn apart.  They lose each other.  They go seperate ways.  One is devout, one is running from God.  They meet up again years later, and after a series of misunderstandings they find that they were destined to be together and fall in love again.  Now, that is just the start-up to A Moment of Weakness - it then goes into a whole second plot, with its' own twists.  In On Every Side, however, that is pretty much it.  It is a nice story.  It is a sweet story.  That's about it.  I believe the author was trying to provoke emotion about our religious freedoms being eroded (for more information on that read David Limbaugh's new book Persecution - excellent).  All in all, if you haven't read A Moment of Weakness, you'll probably really enjoy this one.	2003-12-28

These are sweet, simple stories about the Amish people.  The characters are real, and they face hardship and joy through their faith in God.  These books are not intellectual, deep-thinkers.  They are sweet stories, that make you long for a simple life with family, friends, and God.  They make you feel better for having read them.

I was afraid it was just going to be part of the &quot;Left Behind Franchise&quot;, but it definitely is not.  While still action-oriented, it does not have the cartoonish quality that Left Behind slid into.  It presents a very dark future for the Church.  I think it's premise is entirely believable, as we see the Church slip into moral relativism and complacency.  Today, no public displays of faith, tomorrow no faith.  Please be aware, the cruelty, tortures, etc. that are depicted in this book do go on RIGHT NOW around the world - talk to Christians in Africa, China, and other countries - they are living this today.  We are simplistic to think that life is all just a big shiny Jesus-bubble for us, and that we will be raptured out before persecution begins here.  This book should serve as a wake-up call.	2003-12-10

If this was a first time author, I doubt that it would have been published.  John Grisham has reached a point, (actually, he reached this point about ten years ago!) where he can write anything and it will be a bestseller.  Will there never be another A Time To Kill from this author?  Once you get past The Pelican Brief, it is all a downhill slide.  That is not to say that this book, as well as his other works, are not enjoyable, they just don't grab you and hold you like his earlier work.	2003-11-27

It was an easy and enjoyable read.  What I got out of it was more than just the &quot;dirt&quot; on the food service industry.  She is showing that she and so many of her co-workers weren't just waiting on tables, they were &quot;waiting&quot; on life.  They considered their jobs just a stopping point until they got to their &quot;real&quot; lives - the relationship that would rescue them, the career they were destined for, whatever the dream was.  She looked at waitressing as a temporary job on her way to becoming a writer, then realized that she had been waiting for twenty years.  In the meantime, she had not been waiting for her life to start, she had been living it.  So many people are waiting for their lives to start; when they finish college, after the baby is born, once the kids are in school, once they get that promotion, etc.  Meanwhile, while they are waiting for life to start, it is going full swing.  I always remember a quote by Cher (not someone I would usually quote), and she said that life is not a dress rehearsal.  We should be living it to the fullest, no matter what stage we are in.	2003-06-15

I think it accurately portrays the sad state of the American educational mindset.  Every child (and later, every adult) has to fit, and woe for those square pegs that don't fit.  These teachers and professionals, because of the nature of their jobs, were mainly unable to appreciate Blaze for who he is, and modify their teaching to fit him.  No matter how you try, when teaching a room full of students, the teaching has to be geared toward the \\"average\\".  Too bad so few of us are average.  Blaze is blessed to have a mother who is willing to sacrifice her own goals and desires in order to commit herself to him.  Many parents would take the path of less resistance and accept labels, medications, whatever the \\"experts\\" provided.  We are programmed to believe the experts, and to distrust our own instincts.  Ms. Ginsburg places incredible emphasis on Blaze \\"fitting in\\", even though she recognizes what an exceptional person he is.  Of course, \\"fitting in\\" is safer and more comfortable, and who doesn't want that for their children.  Perhaps since she never fit in, she desires it even more for her son.<br />Speaking as a square peg who has tried to fit in, I am homeschooling my three boys, each of whom I find extraordinary in their own way.  Ms. Ginsburg's honest, heartbreaking, and often joyous book makes me feel like I know her, and that we are kindred spirits.	2003-06-10

I never really cared about Clay Carter.  I never understood why he stayed at the OPD office if he hated it so much - he had to have other options.  He certainly wasn't there for any altruistic reasons.  And granted, $10 million is a lot of money, but he didn't seem to have to struggle too hard with his conscience.  No, in the end he finally seems to feel some remorse, BUT, if he had continued on a successful trajectory, would he have have felt remorse for his actions?  I believe it is the case of the thief not being sorry he stole, but being terribly sorry he was caught.  No, this was a disappointing book.  So much could have been done with this premise.  I'd like to read a book about Helen Warshaw, and how she came to the point of taking down the mass tort lawyers.  That sounds like the sort of tale Grisham tells best, about one little guy taking on the Goliaths.  <br />Ever since Runaway Jury, Grisham's books seem to have gone downhill, with the exception of Painted House.  His books start with good ideas, but just seem to take the path of least resistance as far as storylines.  <br />I'm sure I will read his new books as they come out (I've read all except The Summons), hoping against hope for the Grisham I knew and loved.	2003-04-26

I simply could not manage to care for the characters, especially Ella Brady.  I kept thinking, &quot;Well you dumb little tart, what did you expect!&quot;  The characters seem to have no problem with adultery (they've all done it after all), and really, they seem to be lacking some very basic morals.  I was not at all surprised how the story unfolded, and the ending wrapped itself up in a tidy (and predictable) package. <br />If you want to read a really good Binchy book, try The Glass Lake for starters, then read the rest of her work.  I really feel Tara Road was her last great book, with Scarlet Feather and Quentins pale follow-ups.	2002-11-12

There was no character development, just an unveiling of each persons' worst traits.  Why were these women friends?  If you are going to tell a story abut friendship you need to have more to go on than that they roomed together in college!  None of them seemed real, just caricatures (smart ugly girl, most popular rich girl, poor scheming girl).  This was a useless book.	2001-08-08

I can't see how these people have so many jets, helicopters, high-tech gadgets (so high tech that they have them, but the ruler of the world doesn't?)readily available to them.  I have read all eight books in less than two months.  I'm sure I will finish the series (12 books, I believe) as they come out, just to see how LaHaye and Jenkins interpret end-time prophecies. <br />I do recommend that anyone who reads these practice discernment.  While this may very well be how things play out, there are many valid opinions/interpretations within Christianity.  These books may be fun (at least the first few were) and they may be interesting escapism, and HOPEFULLY they will give readers pause to examine their own relationships with Christ.  However, they are NOT theology, and they are NOT the Bible.  There is a real danger in reading these sort of books INSTEAD of the Bible.  Read the Bible, learn to interpret scripture for yourself.  Do not allow works of popular fiction to take the place of Bible study.  These books are easy reads -enjoy them, but take the real challenge first.	2001-07-05

If you have any fascination with gossip/celebrities or how the &quot;media machine&quot; works, this is a great book.  It is very fast pace, tracing the history of gossip columns from the early &quot;penny papers&quot; through Walter Winchell, Louella Parsons, the ET tonight type programming, and Matt Drudge.  Lots of interesting tidbits about celebrities that I never knew, plus lots of information on how exactly the &quot;publicity people&quot; in Hollywood earn their keep.  Who gets access to stars, why, and the hoops they jump through to keep it.  I have to admit, it made me wonder about my own character (why am I so interested in what perfect strangers are up to) but then again, it is all in fun.  A fun, quick read, with lots of historical information and background.	2001-01-30

While Lombardo seems quite capable, Archy seems to be turning into one of those eccentric bachelor men you just sort of feel sorry for.  He used to be mischevious, now he seems more self-centered. I guess (correctly) at who did it (though not the means of delivering the poison); what character was a red herring; and what I thought were some very obvious connections between various agencies.  All in all, an easy, pleasant read, but not anything like the earlier books.	2000-11-26

Open House was just not up to the same  level as some of her other works.  Nothing was ever resolved, and the  reader never got to learn much about the characters.  I think I was  expecting more &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; - all these characters  (people she normally would never meet) coming into Sam's life and helping  her find her own place.  We never get to know much about the characters,  they just move through the story.  David is only described by his bad  qualities - surely there must have been more to him.  And there were a few  twists that, while pretty cliched, could have added dimension, but they  were resolved so quickly and easily.  And why didn't she get a real job?  Or, if she was going to temp these odd positions, there were probably lots  of interesting people she could meet - but, again, they were there and then  gone quickly.  Like another reader, I also thought the few fairly graphic  sex scenes seemed out of place, and really did not add much to my  understanding or empathy for Sam.<br />Hopefully, Berg's next endeavor will  be better.  I can't believe Oprah picked this one over her other novels.	2000-08-28

It was a page  turner until then, when she sort of &quot;wrapped it all up&quot; with  discussions on her ability to love, etc.  I realize that this was necessary  to pull the story together at the end, but it seemed anticlimactic.<br />I  felt sorry for Kim growing up in that home with such misguided Christians  for parents.  Their &quot;fervor&quot; robbed this person of the joy she  should have been able to have in her faith.  Of course, they did not have  any joy, so they had nothing to share with her.  What was most telling to  me, was that in adulthood her mother told her how wonderful she was, that  she was the best thing that ever happened to them, etc., but never managed  to communicate this to Elizabeth growing up......indeed, she did just the  opposite.  Being a parent is an awesome responsibility.	2000-07-09

I realized that this was a re-working of an earlier novel, but I thought I'd give it a shot anyway.  It was simple and fast-paced, so I went ahead and finished it, but it was really a waste of time.  The characters were  one-dimensional, the plot-line has been done before (Omen, anyone?).  My  personal opinion - the ending of this book is ripe for &quot;sequel&quot;.   I THINK that J. Patterson wants to publish a sequel to this book.  However,  since the original &quot;Virgin&quot; was so poorly received it was  re-packaged, and now gets to take advantage of his fame from &quot;Kiss the  Girls&quot;.  NOW this book will be widely read enough to warrant a sequel.   <br />It seems to be all about the $buck$.....I hate to see someone profiting  off mediocre work.	2000-07-09

I found Mrs. Compson to be the most interesting character - Sarah  was really sort of a dork.  And while I am all for happy endings, this one  seemed to &quot;wrap up&quot; too nicely, like a TV Christmas special or  something.  I think there could have been a great novel in this - all the  parts are there, and using the quilt blocks to tell the stories was a  wonderful device.  I would like to read a sequel that went into more depth  with the relationships between the other quilters as they create their new  business venture.<br />I've read a lot of long books that should have been  much shorter, but this was definitely a short book that should have been  longer and deeper.	1999-06-12

I have read a few of the books from the club, and while I have found them interesting and/or thought-provoking, I never seem to really LIKE the  characters.  I like Novalee and her friends.  They are just regualr people,  living life and managing to do some good.  All of these people were in bad  financial situations, yet none of the them groused about being poor.

He felt that after I read it I would no longer want to be an entrepenuer.  WRONG!  This book is not so much a &quot;how  to&quot; be a manager (though it does give some very specific guidelines)  as it is a psychological look at entrepenuers - what works, what doesn't,  how to get yourself in the correct frame of mind to proceed.  How you - the  entrepenuer - need to need to look at the business in order to be  successful - so that you can run the company, instead of it running you.   <br />I gained a lot of insight from this book.  I did feel it was very wordy,  and really warm-fuzzy (Sarah wants her pies to show she cares - Sarah wants  her spirit to be free - the author cares about Sarah AND her spirit, yada  yada yada).

It has been a long time since I read such a character-driven book that did not sound like an exercise in amateur psychology.  These were real people, who did not spend  a lot of time trying to figure out their &quot;issues&quot; - they were  living life on a daily basis (well, maybe not Marilyn, but that's another  story).  Parts of the story were cliche - I knew what was going to happen  with Bernadette and the baby, and could have seen Rosemary's betrayal a  mile away.  Still, life is full of cliches.  People keep doing the same  things over and over, thinking that they are so different!  I felt like I  really knew these characters.  Often, in a book with such a large  &quot;ensemble cast&quot; I have a hard time keeping track of who is who,  but not with this one.  I stayed up late several nights in a row, unable to  put it down.	1999-04-19
US	52719327	R234TPZR7EWOCK	0451197747	795266779	The Deep End of the Ocean	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Started off good, and then.....	I have a 13 month old son, and as I was reading I kept picturing him missing.  I couldn't put the book down.  And then....Ben just walking to the door and wanting to mow the lawn seemed so contrived.  I think Vincent  pointed it out very well to his psychiatrist - the kid was a mile from the  police station for almost ten years and no one could find him??  I also  thought that Cecil's motivation for taking him needed to be more  fleshed-out.  &quot;Mentally ill&quot; is pretty lame.  I would have liked  more information about what led her to take that particular child - what  circumstances did she raise him under - and why did she keep leaving those  shoes around?<br />Like many of the other readers, I did not care for Beth.   It would be nice if this was just a story about a superwoman who went all  out for her family (like a Lifetime movie, or something).  I think that  would have been very cliched.  Everyone reacts differently to tragedy -  this is a story of how these people reacted.  Not everyone is a hero.<br />I  would recommend the book, but not glowingly.	1999-04-15

I enjoyed the book, but it took me two weeks to complete - I usually read a Kellerman in 3-4 days.  I had a pretty good idea who the killer was, no big suprises there.  I saw absolutely no reason for the character of Cora  Adamson.  Also, I felt that with the use of so many racially bigotted  remarks by the various characters he was trying to make some point about  racial harmony or something, and all the remarks about O.J. Simpson  reinforced that (no question as to his opinion on that case!).  It seemed  somewhat unnecessary to the plotline.	1999-03-19

I read this book expecting some typical abused-spouse overcomes melodrama.  That is not what it was about.  From a literary standpoint, I thought the ending was fabulous.  AFter I finished it I laid awake for a while, then  got up to check on my own son.	1999-02-13

I overheard someone saying they were late for a dinner because they could not tear temselves away from this book.  I have been working my way thorugh this for three weeks now, and am only 2/3 of the way (I usually read at  least one book a week).  Granted, it is long.  TOO long.  I just cannot  bring myself to care about the characters, or Ruth's breasts.  I want to  give up, but feel like I may be just getting to the good part - sort of  like with &quot;She's Come Undone&quot;.	1998-12-28

I usually manage to finish a book every wek or so, but this one took  almost five.  Granted, it was over 700 pages, but as other readers have  commented, a lot of that could have come out.  the book just moved too  slowly.  Several times I started tp give up and move on to something else,  but I did feel compelled to finish it.  I am glad that I did - once we got  to the trial it picked up, and I really enjoyed it from that point on.  Too  bad that was 3/4 of the way through.  I would only recommend this to  someone that I knew to be a history buff.  Or very patient.	1998-10-11
US	52719327	R2DG280G81NY4E	1576734587	12194163	On Becoming Baby Wise	Books	4	1	1	N	N	Clear cut directions	I was given this book by a nurse friend who swore by it.  I used it, with  some modifications.  I was very nervous at the idea of taking care of a  baby and had no idea what to do.  All the other books that I read talked  about demand feeding, and no sleep, letting the baby run the show, really.   This book gives clear-cut directions, provides schedules for nap time,  playtime, feeding.  I put my son on a 3 hour feeding schedule (as they had  him on at the hospital where I delivered) and it worked fine - at four  months he was 25&quot; long and 20 lbs.  I have heard many criticisms of  this book,mainly regarding babies who were not getting enough to eat based  on the 3 hour schedule.  That can certainly happen, though with all the  charts the book provides for monitoring poop, etc. it seems like you would  catch on to a problem pretty quick.  I think you have to take it like  anything else - I used their guidelines, but I modified it to suit my  family.  My son started sleeping through the night at ten weeks.  I plan on  purchasing Babywise II, now that I've started him on solids and again,  cannot find clear directions on how much to feed and when.	1998-09-30

Since the last few Scarpetta novels left much to be desired, I was not expecting much out of this one.  But - I loved her first three so much, I kept thinking maybe she's pulled it back together.  No such luck.<br />I cannot imagine that a reader could understand this book without having read the others before it.  I am so sick of Lucy and her chronic problems, and the rest of them, too.  I didn't care if she killed a major character off.  The book was empty.  Give me a break.<br />I enjoyed the ealier books because they were exciting, and scary, and you never knew what would happen next.  The last few are just tired, like Cornwell har run out of ideas - or maybe she is exorcising demons of her own. I am bored with the series.  END	1998-09-12

Over the  last few years MHC's books have become very formulaic, the protagonists all  seem to blend together.  Lacey Farrell was simply someone I could not get  interested in.  I kept reading, hoping it would get better.  I was  interested in reading this book because I thought it would give some sort  of &quot;insider's view&quot; to the workings of the Witness Protection  Program.  I cannot imagine that they let people in the program call home  once a week - for just the same reasons as was shown in the book!!!  I have  a hard time feeling any empathy for characters that are as stupid as these.	1998-08-23
US	52719327	RHFD7TD229OXL	0440222877	221632648	Missing Pieces	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Next, on the Jerry Spring show...	The tone of this book annoyed me to the end.  I kept reading because I  expected a big finish - nothing.  Kate Sinclair whined through the entire  book, and never developed any backbone or moral character. She should have  stopped enabling Jo Lynn years before.  The protagonist does not have to be  perfect, but for me it needs to be at least someone that I would be able to  have some respect for.  Plus, it didn't seem like she learned anything -  she was still the same, and luckily for her her family dynamics had  changed.  This was no &quot;See Jane Run&quot; and excellent Fielding  novel.	1998-08-14
US	52719327	R2QU7XLSR9FLEA	0385490992	454775948	The Street Lawyer	Books	5	0	0	N	N	One of Grisham's best...	I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and rank it second only to A Time To Kill of his novels.  While it was not a &quot;page turner&quot; like The Firm or Pelican Brief it was a good story.  There were characters you could care about, and a nice lack of violence.  It made me think.  I think it is certainly an improvement over some of his more recent novels, most notably Runaway Jury.	1998-07-22
