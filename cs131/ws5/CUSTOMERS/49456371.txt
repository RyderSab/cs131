Old and new readers of Agatha Christie's whodunits will not be disappointed with her 1957 puzzler.  It has an unforgettable opening sequence, an ingenious denouement, and an interesting sleuth, especially created for the occasion, named Lucy Eylesbarrow.  Although it is the elderly Jane Marple who exerts her powers of detection, she does it by remote control while her much younger friend does the spadework - or the domestic work.  As Agatha Christie explains, \\"The point about Lucy Eylesbarrow was that all worry, anxiety, and hard work went out of a house when she came into it.\\"  Accordingly, the tertiary-trained domestic, Lucy, is soon installed in Rutherford Hall, where Jane Marple believes a body thrown from a train might be hidden.<br /><br />Surprises, further murders, gossip, marriage proposals, and poisonings follow in rapid succession, so that before you know it, the hours have sped by, the murderer is revealed, and you admit that once again you were quite unable to guess whodunit.<br /><br />Agatha Christie adds to the usual cozy elements of her murder mysteries a heavy involvement with passenger trains, timetables and railway matters so beloved of the British.  Otherwise you'll find the book fits into the pattern of the dysfunctional family's struggles being worked out with a particularly stubborn, callous and crusty old man as the family's head.<br /><br />Feature film and TV adaptations of this novel have been made, the most faithful to the text featuring Joan Hickson who also can be heard in an unabridged reading on audiotapes.	2005-09-16

For two reasons I welcome this 2004 reissue.  My copy of an earlier audio tape version proved to have been transferred at an incorrect speed, so that Martyn C Webster's original production sounded like monkeys chattering at the zoo.  A second reason is that it marks the debut of playwright and broadcaster Peter Coke in the title role.  Marjorie Westbury is here, of course, as Steve, a part she had already played for nine years.<br /><br />Frances Durbridge revised \\"The Gilbert Case\\" for a radio re-run in 1959, but this is the earlier version from 1954.  His sleuth, Paul Temple, becomes involved in the Gilbert Case when a murder victim's father comes to him convinced that the man charged with the murder is innocent.  It takes eight tightly scripted half-hour episodes for this belief to be tested, during which the Temples sip martinis and exchange affectionate badinage unscathed by the numerous attempts to blow them and their car to smithereens.  Their escapades never take them far away from London in \\"The Gilbert Case\\".<br /><br />Restoration engineers have worked wonders to bring this earliest surviving Paul Temple radio series to acceptable quality.  The sound is not quite as crisp as in the later radio cases.  With the breaks between episodes edited out, the eight episodes have been made to fit onto 3 CDs.	2005-06-12

Seances were in vogue in the world known to Agatha Christie in the early 1930s.  Contemporary novelists and playwrights began to exploit their dramatic potential, and it was in 1931 that Agatha Christie incorporated one into her novel, \\"The Sittaford Mystery\\".<br /><br />This ever-ingenious writer incorporates much else into the novel, of course.  There are the \\"bright young things\\" of the Tommy and Tuppence variety, who contribute to the sleuthing undertaken by the local constabulary.  There is an escaped convict.  There is a snow-bound village.  There are new residents from New Zealand, whom nobody knows and who may not be what they seem.  There is a will, and legacy hunters who might be any of the characters in disguise.<br /><br />Readers can therefore expect a tightly wrought, engrossing mystery.  I was aware while reading it that it had much in common with \\"Murder at the Vicarage\\" and then discovered that it was the Christie novel that immediately followed it.  Miss Marple is not here, however, nor is Hercule Poirot - both unsuited to trudging through the snow on Dartmoor.	2005-06-11

Luxury trains travelling to holiday resorts provided an irresistible setting for novelists and filmmakers in the decades between the two world wars.  Agatha Christie's 1928 murder mystery features the Blue Train, travelling across France to the Riviera, and a cast of travelers that includes Hercule Poirot.<br /><br />There has to be motivation for the murder that occurs, and so expect a lot of business concerning precious jewels, international intrigues and complicated human relationships.  There is also a former lady's companion who has lived for several years at that famous Christie location, St Mary Mead.  She is not Miss Marple.<br /><br />Agatha Christie considered this her worst novel.  Coloring her judgment were recollections of several unhappy events in her own life that occurred during the time she wrote it: the breakdown of her Christie marriage and the death of her mother.  I think its best quality is the considerable exposure it gives to Hercule Poirot.  Seldom is he seen in the pages of an Agatha Christie novel as much as in \\"The Mystery of the Blue Train\\".	2005-05-10

This is one of my favorite books from Agatha Christie's later years.  Her grip of story telling, plotting and planning is still strong.  There is some humor in the narrative and amusement is provided by many of the characters.<br /><br />Agatha Christie tries her hand at the girls' school setting here.  Older reader will suspect that she was well-acquainted with similar settings chosen by A A Milne and Dorothy Sayers, and that she had been brought up on the once popular school girl annuals.  Of course there needs to be a raison d'Ãªtre behind the series of murders that occurs at the school and this is well narrated also.<br /><br />I have mentioned the narration several times.  It is an element that helps explain this writer's phenomenal popularity.  She gets the timing right.  Other writers in this genre produce more elegant prose but somehow fail in this regard.<br /><br />At this time in her career, Agatha Christie was experimenting with narrative methods.  She attempted the \\"quick scene change\\" method here, and brings it off with skill and flair.  She also, at this time in her career, frequently milked the situation where something was briefly glimpsed in a mirror, or a familiar face briefly glimpsed at a great distance.  Watch out for these occurrences as you turn the pages to reach Hercule Poirot's final revelation of just who is the cat among the pigeons.	2005-04-13

Those who have read hundreds of crime novels will surely never have been asked to guess who killed the woman found dead at the bottom of a well in the courtyard of the house where she had arranged a swimming pool party the night before.  Such is the task for the reader, shadowing Inspector Thanet, in this highly enjoyable 1999 addition to Dorothy Simpson's publications.<br /><br />The enjoyment derives mainly from Dorothy Simpson's mastery of story telling.  Other writers might provide deeper psychological analyses or incorporate more detailed forensic pathology along the way, but Dorothy Simpson keeps her story moving.  There is sometimes an amazing coincidence or two, and an occasional shade of gothic melodrama, but no more than voracious readers of detective fiction and suckers for good stories might expect.	2005-03-22

I have read helpful and detailed appreciations of this book on the Internet.  I shall just add two points.  Firstly, I think the book's great strength is that it is written by a skeptic.  Ghost stories are not likely to be taken seriously if their reporting is sensationalized.  James Robertson has collected and presented them with just the right mix of detached scholarship and narrative simplicity.  Secondly, it should be obvious that ghost stories are ideal material for old-fashioned listening rather than for reading.  Accordingly, I strongly recommend the Soundings audio version of this book, enabling you to hear the Scottish ghost stories told by a Scotsman.  James Bryce delivers them beautifully, tossing the place names off with ready familiarity.<br /><br />With its prolific folklore and long history of civil strife, its many ancient castles and churches, its many bleak, windswept and lonely locations for human habitation, Scotland has been a fertile place for the growth of tales of the supernatural.  Most such tales date from earlier more credulous times than ours but Robertson's collection includes recent examples.	2005-03-09

When you are the world's best-selling author, and have given so much pleasure to readers for more than fifty years, the pressure to keep going must be hard to resist.  Dame Agatha kept going long enough to complete this last book a year or two before she died in 1974.<br /><br />Don't expect the initiative and ingenuity found in her best mysteries.  She limits herself to a re-working of old plots.  Her sleuths are two of her earlier creations - Tommy and Tuppence Beresford, now in their 70s and chattering politely.  There is much tedious reminiscing, much collecting of village gossip, and the occasional diatribes on the ills of the world and the errors of the young.  Dogs, old gardens, old houses, old children's books and toys are included.<br /><br />To take up an Agatha Christie book is usually like taking up a nice, warm, familiar cardigan.  You know you'll be cozy and comfortable and it's likely you'll be unwilling to take it off.  The trouble here is that the cardigan sags badly and seems to be unraveling.  It lacks tension and the requisite shape and pattern.  Shouldn't the book end with a solution that makes the reading of it worthwhile?  You won't find that satisfaction here.	2005-02-07

Tightly plotted and dark in tone, this little whodunit is one of Agatha Christie's best books.  As the original title suggests, there are only five suspects (Five Little Pigs), but don't expect that it is easy to spot the killer.<br /><br />After artist Amyas Crale dies from poisoning, his wife is hanged for the murder.  Their daughter, sent to live in Canada, is now a young adult. Convinced that her mother was innocent, she persuades Hercule Poirot to investigate.<br /><br />The book adapts very well to a dramatization such as the splendid DVD version.  The book's premise calls out for the artistic use of flashbacks which work so well.  Music is also skillfully added and camera work, settings and lavish wardrobe products are superb.<br /><br />Leading the small cast is David Suchet, presenting a Poirot in somber mode in keeping with the desperately sad circumstances.  Gemma Jones and (briefly) Patrick Malahide are players familiar to older viewers and amongst the younger players is Rachel Stirling, the daughter of Diana Rigg, and Toby Stephens, a son of Maggie Smith.	2005-01-17

Surely it tops the best-selling list of a best-selling author!  Older readers may not recognize it by its current title, its original and a later replacement having been deemed too racist.  Nothing racist, I hope, was picked up in my school English classes, where I used it to help develop pupils' appetite for reading.<br /><br />Agatha Christie's achievement is remarkable. She creates ten characters, all suspected of murder, who are lured to an island.  She has them meet their deaths one by one as nominated in the nursery rhyme \\"Ten Little Indians\\" which is displayed in their rooms.  She has each murder occur in a situation where almost all the other island guests might have had opportunity to commit it.  As if devising all this were not enough, she also frequently takes us into the minds of the various characters - something that the whole nature of detective fiction usually prohibits.  This construction is not only intricate but also compact; it is one of her shorter novels. Built on this scheme, the book must exclude Mrs Christie's regular  sleuths, Poirot and Miss Marple. Instead, the dwindling number of island guests generate their own investigation.<br /><br />So here is a book that offers double the pleasure that murder mysteries provide.  As well as challenging you to solve the mystery, it also amazes you that so ingenious a mystery could be contrived.	2004-12-24

I have seen this book reissued in a series comprising the best detective fiction of all time, its editor and selector nominating and praising its special features.  It certainly has a prize winning first chapter.  In the pages of \\"Moby Dick\\" or the novels of Joseph Conrad, you won't find a better description of a captain's predicament before he gives the order to abandon ship in mid ocean.  Found at their best here are Crofts' knowledge of ships and his talent for narrating old-fashioned adventure yarns.  Once the Jane Vosper sinks, however, so does the book's quality.  An investigation into the cause of the sinking becomes allied to an investigation into the disappearance of the man delegated to do the investigating.  When Inspector French takes up the investigations, your interest might revive; grammatical errors and signs of inadequate proof reading, however, won't help to maintain it.<br /><br />Having over the years read and reviewed all of Croft's novels, I urge those who like to sample old-fashioned mystery yarns to try his \\"Starvel Tragedy\\" or \\"Fatal Venture\\".	2004-12-19

Although its principal character, Mr Harding, the Warden of Barchester, suffers abject misery and extreme anxiety during most of this novel, the reader of \\"The Warden\\" will enjoy one of the happiest, richest and warmest experiences to be gained from the whole of English Literature.<br /><br />Untypically short, yet three years in the making, \\"The Warden\\" has a simple structure that Trollope utlized again and again.  Take a moral dilemma of some sort, one that provides endless pros and cons to be argued, one that possibly takes many hundreds of pages to resolve, explore its social, political and financial implications, and show how it touches the lives of characters not too unlike ourselves.<br /><br />The dilemma here concerns the income of Septimus Harding, the Warden of Barchester.  Under the terms of a will, dated 1434, twelve superannuated woolcarders were to be accommodated in an almshouse, receiving one shilling and fourpence per day.  A residence was to be provided for a warden who was to receive the income from the remainder of the testator's property.  Now, more than 400 years later, there seems to be an imbalance in these depositions.  The almshouse inmates continue to receive only one shilling and fourpence, while the warden, living on the proceeds of some valuable properties, receives eight hundred pounds annually and the use of the warden's house.<br /><br />The dilemma faces a young Barchester surgeon, John Bold.  If he allows the imbalance to continue, the wishes of the original benefactor, he believes, are being nullified.  If he succeeds in having the warden's comfortable living discontinued, he will lose forever the possibility of making the warden's daughter his wife.  And so the issue is taken up, argued and publicized.<br /><br />As Anthony Trollope reveals in his autobiography, this tiny novel was successful enough (it earned him twenty pounds) to lead him to consider writing more of the same, and he soon began \\"Barchester Towers\\".<br /><br />English actor Sir Nigel Hawthorne, brilliant as Archdeacon Grantly in a memorable TV adaptation of this novel, revisits Trollope's Barchester to provide a robust, opulent, complete and unabridged reading that no Trollope enthusiast should miss hearing.thorne, brilliant as Archdeacon Grantly in a memorable TV adaptation of this novel, revisits Trollope's Barchester to provide a robust, opulent, complete and unabridged reading that no Trollope enthusiast should miss hearing.	2004-11-02

Generally regarded as one of Dickens' best novels, \\"Bleak House\\" comprises many special features.<br /><br />Firstly there are several social evils of Dickens' time, evils which he either helped to expose or whose exposure by others he thought it prudent to incorporate.  The aim of lawyers to make business for themselves he dramatized in the case Jarndyce v Jarndyce.  The misguided missionary zeal of self-appointed philanthropists who set their vision on far away places, peoples, and cultures while ignoring the needs of the family and the situation at home is personified especially in Mrs Jellyby and Mr Chadband.<br /><br />Secondly, there is the narrative format: the narrative is shared between one of the principal characters, Esther Summerson, writing in the past tense, and an anonymous narrator who writes in the present tense.  The latter narrative contains some of the best imagery and most powerful prose to be found in Dickens' works.  The novel's famous opening, depicting a London fog, is an example of this.<br /><br />Thirdly, there is the presence of a detective, Mr Detective Bucket.  Detective fiction, so large a section in book shops nowadays, was unknown in Dickens' time.  He foreshadowed most of its elements in \\"Bleak House\\", although his incurable reliance on coincidence and rudimentary grasp of psychology militates against the creation of genuine suspense.<br /><br />Finally, I identify the novel's structure as one of its special features.  \\"It is the best constructed of all his books,\\" wrote G K Chesterton.<br /><br />On every page there is the stamp of genius, I believe, but I also believe that the novel has many flaws.  Once the main plot lines are established, the pace slows down excessively, part way through, and a parade of tiresome characters like Harold Skimpole are allowed to occupy whole chapters at a time.  There are mawkish deathbed scenes.  Character drawing is not always successful.  The best-drawn are the eccentrics or those who have some physical attribute or mannerism that Dickens can exaggerate.<br /><br />\\"Bleak House\\" is the Dickens novel I have re-read most often.  At all ages I have found it absorbing.  In recent times it has received great advocacy by the issue of a complete reading of it - all 39 hours - by Hugh Dickson.  The possessor of a pleasant natural voice, suggesting a tenor if he were to sing, Hugh Dickson contrives to adopt and project the voices of the more than 60 characters that people this novel.  A masterly achievement.physical attribute or mannerism that Dickens can exaggerate.<br /><br />\\"Bleak House\\" is the Dickens novel I have re-read most often.

Having read all Freeman Wills Crofts's detective fiction at one time or another and reviewed most of it enthusiastically, I regret that there is not much to be said in favor of his short stories.  The story that bears this book's title is a big disappointment.  Famed for his knowledge of the ins and outs of early C20th trains, timetables, engineering, and plot structure in his novels, he might be expected to construct a brilliant little piece under the title \\"Mystery of the Sleeping Car Express\\".  Instead he delivers a scrappy narrative, adds a sketch plan that beggars comprehension, and leaves at least one reader feeling that the mystery of the sleeping car express remains a mystery.  This was Crofts' first short story, written in 1921.  As with his first Inspector French novel, \\"Inspector French's Greatest Case\\", 1926, he unfortunately chose a title that in the event produced disappointment.<br /><br />Crofts seemed to need a full length novel to display his powers best: the patient unraveling of the mystery, and the painstaking checking, theorizing and testing that led to the solution.  There is one story in this collection, however, that is a total success.  Written in 1933, it is titled \\"The Level Crossing\\". It, rather than the title story in this collection, well deserves inclusion in various \\"railway\\" story anthologies, and makes this book well worth the purchase price.	2004-08-23

When Lord Peter Wimsey investigates further and discovers that the death is actually murder, it is still not proper, in the Bellona Club, to abandon the euphemism \\"unpleasantness\\".  Thus is established the tone and the subject of Dorothy L Sayers' fifth work of detective fiction, written in 1928.<br /><br />Readers of \\"Golden Age\\" detective fiction will find the usual wit and polish in the writing and a central idea for a crime that derives from nice points of logic and a specialized knowledge of anatomy and medicine. Somehow these strengths, together with a preponderance of dialogue, also account for the book's weakness.  It lacks atmosphere.  After describing the opening scene in the Bellona Club with great care and effect, Miss Sayers rarely thereafter gives a thought to sketching in details of time, place, action or surroundings.<br /><br />So this is one of Dorothy L Sayers' books that will always provide me with entertainment and rich enjoyment, while making me aware that it does not quite provide everything I ask of great detective fiction.	2004-08-21

It is good to see Angela Thirkell's light novels once more receiving attention, especially in the USA.  \\"High Rising\\" is one of her first novels, dating from 1933.  There were many English novelists in the 1930s who mined the traditionally English vein of gentle parody, graceful writing, mild absurdity, and class distinction.  Much handsomer than most of them, and exhibiting the influence of Jane Austen and Anthony Trollope, Angela Thirkell peopled her novels with descendants of characters found in the latter's Barsetshire novels.<br />If that gives an idea of the flavor and style that might be enjoyed in her books, I can add that this one chronicles the dizzy doings of Laura Morland, a novelists, who juggles the demands of four sons, her publisher, her secretary, her formidable maid Stoker, and a friend George Knox whom most think should be more than a friend to her.  The custom of \\"coming to tea\\" sets them all interacting.  Watch for the number of verbs Angela Thirkell can employ  - from plunge, to insinuate - to describe how characters can enter a room.	2004-07-03

The urge to escape the comforts, routine and refinements of our living conditions to somewhere more challenging, primitive and raw is something that many of us feel - especially those who read books.  The books we read can sometimes stimulate the urge, sometimes satisfy it.  All I ask of such books is that the author can write well and that he is not boastful.<br />Eric Newby, especially in \\"A Small Place in Italy\\", meets these requirements admirably.  Indeed, he ranks for me as a travel writer of near genius.  He was almost 50 years old when he and his Italian born wife Wanda took up permanent residence in a ruined farmhouse in northern Italy.  His account of the trials and tribulations that followed, the neighbors and the locality, is told in this wonderfully witty, readable and valuable book.  Part of the value rests in the sociological and historical dimensions it gives.  Even while he lived there, the customs, the occupations and the life styles were fast disappearing.<br />If you enjoy this genre, you'll want to give \\"A Small Place in Italy\\" a prominent place on your bookshelf.	2004-05-25

Jane Austen enthusiasts (Janeites) tend to re-read \\"Northanger Abbey\\" less often than they do her other novels.  It nevertheless has several merits.<br />One distinction is that the voice of Jane Austen the narrator is perhaps picked up more clearly here than in her other novels.  Here you will find, for example, her minor dissertation in praise of the novel, \\"... work in which the greatest powers of the mind are displayed, in which the most thorough knowledge of the human nature, the happiest delineation of its varieties, the liveliest effusions of wit and humor are conveyed to the world in the best chosen language\\".<br />A second quality is the strong sense of location that emanates from its pages.  Jane Austen is rarely a travel guide, but here she conducts the reader around the small English city of Bath.<br />A third excellence is its depiction of its \\"heroine\\" Catherine Moreland, a 17 year-old who gradually learns that reality is not the same as it's depicted in Mrs Radcliffe's novels.<br />And so it is great fun to read of the novel-reading heroine Catherine finding mortifications and infatuations in Bath.  It is fun also to see if \\"something must and will happen to throw a hero in her way\\".	2004-03-31

Moving into a writing career that was to make her the world's most published author, Agatha Christie sent his book to her publisher in the early 1920s.<br />Already her strengths are evident: her gift for story telling, her ability to engage a likely readership aged from 8 to 80, her ability to pull a fast one on her readers, and her ability to reproduce actual ordinary conversation.  In the 1920s it was normal to hear young adults calling each other \\"Old Bean\\" and \\"Old Thing\\", and they do so here.  A weakness still is her inability to devise a means of dispensing with the requirement for long explanations, at the end of a mystery novel<br />\\"The Secret Adversary\\" is not a pure mystery novel, however.  It is part romance, part adventure, part ripping yarn, and part whodunit.  Agatha Christie takes up some of the props found in each of these types of fiction.  There are the lively young adults, Tommy and Tuppence, eager to make ends meet by undertaking a little detective work.  There is the hunt for a secret document that will determine the fate of the great nations of the world.  There are the apparent adversaries (\\"The German\\" is one of them), and the incredible eavesdropping and kidnapping situations.<br />Avid Christie readers will want to sample this early work, but general readers should choose from her productions of the 1930s.	2004-02-15

With one exception (\\"The Level Crossing\\"), Freeman Wills Crofts' short stories are unremarkable.  Even less impressive is this 1948 collection entitled \\"Murderers Make Mistakes\\".  It derives from a series of short radio plays with, to quote the author, \\"...about half presented in the form of Double Stories, in which the criminal first describes his actions and then Chief Inspector French tells us now he learned the truth\\".  Unfortunately, their brevity militates against their success.  The fascination of Crofts' full-length stories derives from his engineer's eye for detail, the slow gathering of details that appear relevant, and the constant and relentless checking of alibis.  Without these features, these stories read like an author's \\"ideas for plots I might use one day\\". Moreover, identical means and motives for murder reappear over and over again in these stories.<br />So unappealing were these embryos in comparison to the author's fully developed novels, I was in danger of being turned off this author's works altogether.<br />All of which can be reduced to two words - not recommended.	2004-01-11

Producing recordings of operas is a costly business.  Opera enthusiasts who wish to own recorded versions of their favorite operas, must thus expect to have credit cards that can call up large funds.  Hence, the usefulness and value of another art form, one that developed in the C20th.  This new art form is the guide to recorded opera, a collection of critical assessments and recommendations intended to help readers avoid wasting their money.<br />Of all such publications - and they can provide endless hours of absorbing reading even if the aim is not necessarily to get a well-informed recommendation - an outstanding example is The Metropolitan Opera Guide to Recorded Opera.  Developed from an idea by Roland Gellat, and edited by Paul Gruber, it surveys and assesses virtually all opera sets on record up to 1993, the year of its publication.  The roster of reviewers is impressive, comprising a team of twenty highly qualified contributors working in the USA and England.<br />Something I always look for in books of this type is a detailed index.  The one here meets all my requirements.  It enables me to find all references in the book to, for example, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, a singer you might think is represented in recorded opera sets more than anybody else.  It is Placido Domingo, however, whose index entries occupy more space here than those of any other singer.<br />An alphabetical order of composers dictates where the recorded opera reviews are found.  Once you have found \\"M\\" near the center of the book, for example, you can locate Mozart, and find his operas discussed in chronological order.  There is also an index of opera titles, if you prefer that means of finding what you want.  There are no illustrations, and pages are laid out in two-column format, so the book is reasonably compact and not too weighty.<br />Each reviewer is set the task of assessing all available recorded sets of a particular opera (a luxury few of us can enjoy) and providing a recommendation.  Perhaps it is in the nature of opera, an art form with so many inter-relating components, that few single versions of a particular opera are found to excel on all counts.  One of the few is the de Sabata \\"Tosca\\".

Fame and wide acclaim came to Agatha Christie in 1926 when \\"The Murder of Roger Ackroyd\\" was published.  In the same year, however, her disappearance and the eleven-day search for her attracted even more attention.  Subsequently in interviews and in her own autobiography, Agatha Christie refused to explain or refer to the incident.  It was inferred that the breakdown of her first marriage had been one aspect of the mystery, and her reluctance to refer to anything so painful was respected.<br />Since her death, she has been the subject of several biographies.  None that I have read, even that of her second husband, Sir Max Mellowan, provides a satisfactory motivation or time table for the eleven missing days in 1926.<br />It seems remarkable that a young writer from the smallest state in Australia should be the one to adequately research the subject and to have access to the best informants.  Jared Cade knows Agatha Christie's novels, plays, poetry and short sories well, and demonstrates how insights into this major crisis in Agatha Christie's life reside in them.  His theories are sound, his rebuttal of false and misleading explanations is strong, and his judgments - even of Dame Agatha herself - are balanced.<br />Interest in what happened to the world' best-selling author back in 1926 may no longer be strong, but it is good to read something that at last sets the record straight.  It is, moreover, a fascinating and focussed biography of someone who tried to keep herself away from public scrutiny.  I like the compliment paid to the author by his principal informants, descendants of Agatha Christie's best friend: &quot;This is the only biography that tells Agatha's life as it really was. Your insight into her life and personality is unsurpassed.&quot;	2003-11-28

The sleuth is Luke, a recuperating young man who chances to share a railway carriage with a garrulous old lady, Miss Pinkerton, who is on her way to Scotland Yard to enlist help in putting an end to a series of accidental deaths in her village, deaths that she believes are murders.  Intrigued, especially when she is killed by a hit and run driver before reaching her destination, he decides to investigate.<br />So expect to enjoy time with him in an English village full of eccentrics where all the work is done by servants and most of the time is spent in gossip.  Don't expect sophisticated prose or an intrusive narrator. Agatha Christie keeps herself well hidden, directing a large cast as they deliver banal dialogue, and contriving wonderfully well to lead suspicion away from the killer.	2003-11-19

Few would argue with the contention that no better writer has ever tried her hand at writing detective fiction than Dorothy L Sayers.  I happen to like good writing, and I don't mind if it features more strongly than the puzzle component in a mystery novel.<br />\\"Strong Poison\\" abounds in wit, charm, characterization, and literary excellence.  This is the one that begins with two whole chapters of a judge's summing up.  On trial is Harriet Vane, accused of killing her lover by administering arsenic.  All believe she is guilty except one jury member, Miss Murchison, who prevents the jury from bringing in a \\"guilty\\" verdict, and someone attending the trial, Lord Peter Wimsey, who determines to prove Harriet's innocence and make her his wife.<br />Dorothy L Sayers then makes little pretence at hiding the identity of the killer.  Instead she unfolds a fascinating investigation into how the crime was committed and how Lord Peter and one or two helpers collected the evidence to convict.<br />Neither as long nor as long-winded as some of Miss Sayers' later detective fiction, this one offers rich and pure pleasure all the way.  The additional luxury of hearing it read by Ian Carmichael in audio book form is well worth investigating.	2003-11-18

Thirty-year old Mrs Agatha Christie turned a nice little profit with this, her first book, in 1920.  It introduced Hercule Poirot.  Wisely, she gave him many flamboyant, eccentric characteristics to leaven the depiction of detection work, but unwisely she created a character of advanced age that she subsequently needed to preserve for a further fifty years.<br />What became the regular Christie recipe for a whodunit is found here.  Perhaps there is a tad more reliance on the dispensing of medicines, reflecting the author's occupation during World War One.  A formula that she later discarded was the use of a narrator - Hastings - who presents one of the \\"cases\\" of his friend Poirot.  1920 and the publication of this book marked the opening of the \\"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\".  Expect that there are plenty of servants, plenty of drinks at bedtime, much making and re-making of wills, and characters - including Poirot - who walk everywhere.<br />This rates highly in the Christie collection for classic charm, readability and ingenuity.  Few of her books from the 1920s excel it.	2003-09-25

Ed McBain was well into his long series of 87th Precinct books by the time the time he produced this one in 1983.  This one is longer than most and has a huge cast.  Social groups depicted include theatre personnel, drug dealers, diamond merchants, and of course the familiar 87th precinct cops.  Accordingly, there are a huge number of suspects for the reader, and possibly the author, to finally attach to the various crimes committed.<br />Binding together all the disparate elements is the symbol ice.  It represents the drugs that lie behind many of the crimes, it coats the night streets of New York where many of the crimes are committed, it seems to run through the veins of many of the dealers, rapists, charlatans and cheats that are encountered here, and its fragility typifies the fragility of law and order and even decent relationships in this so-called center of civilization.<br />Lurid yet often beautiful, engrossing yet often repellant, this is certainly a McBain book that can be included amongst his best.	2003-09-23

You have probably read hundreds of books that use these ever-fresh ingredients.  There is one small English village, peopled by eccentric collectors, partner-swapping couples, and a class system in microcosm, housing well-disguised deviants who write poison pen letters, carry guilty secrets, or devise well-planned murders.<br />Caroline Graham is a current dealer in these items, and I reckon she turns them into as good an entertainment as any writer, past or present, I know.  Her own experience in the theatre provides the amazing verisimilitude in this, her second crime novel.  The murder occurs during the opening night of an amateur production of \\"Amadeus\\".<br />Older readers will recall how New Zealand writer Ngaio Marsh used the theatre for some of her murder mystery settings.  Miss Graham is a much better writer.  Rarely in detective fiction will you find such depth and variety of character drawing, and such charming and elegant prose.<br />Her sleuth is Chief Inspector Barnaby and his assistant is Sergeant Troy.  As created by Caroline Graham, they are considerably different from their television depictions in a popular series \\"Midsomer Murders\\" that has already run to more than twenty episodes.	2003-08-14

Our capacity to form first impressions is a tendency Jane Austen examines in all her fiction.  Her characters sometimes are shown to form incorrect impressions.  Her characters often strive to give false impressions.  None of her fictional characters is so preoccupied with setting up a public image in order to gain her own ends as is the Lady Susan who gives this novella its name.  Lady Susan is the archetypal coquette, the skilled deceiver.  She is Thackeray's Becky Sharp, fifty years before her time.<br />Jane Austen plays the game of deception with us too.  In this novella, which is almost entirely in epistolary form, we form the impression from reading Lady Susan's first letter, that she is a grieving widow, devoted to the care and education of her 16 year old daughter, and willing at last to accede to her brother-in-law's pressing invitation to stay with him and his family.  Wrong!  We too have been duped, as we soon discover.<br />Jane Austen first drafted several of her novels in epistolary form, that is to say, in the form of letters exchanged by her characters.  This one, which may have been the earliest of all her surviving works, alone remained in this form.  And great fun it is, although Lady Susan's contriving and heartlessness, especially in regard to her daughter, sometimes goes beyond the comic to the cruel.<br />Naxos has added to the fun that this \\"entertainment\\" can provide by issuing the novella in audio book form.  Seven actors are allocated the parts of the seven letter writers.  Furthermore, there is no abridgement of the text, and there are some snatches of music that serve to provide breaks between the letters and indicate the passing of time.  Altogether, an ideal production.	2003-07-22

Detective and police procedural work in fiction nowadays is as much about extra-curricular conflict as it is about crime solving.  Family life and partnerships are dysfunctional, colleagues are vicious, and superiors are likely to hand the case over to somebody else.  As W S Gilbert would say, \\"A policeman's lot is not a happy one\\".  By comparison Freeman Wills Croft's Detective Chief Inspector French of Scotland Yard had a very easy time in this 1935 \\"Golden Age\\" novel.  Colleagues all spring into action willingly, his superior is entirely supportive, his marriage is stable, and he is free to devote all his energies to pure detective work.<br />His investigation is into the affairs of Nornes Ltd, a large firm of jewelers.  The managing director proposes a weekend board meeting in his comfortable house at Guildford, south of London, to discuss the ways of heading off the threat of bankruptcy.  When the guests prepare to settle to work on Sunday morning it is discovered that one of their number has died during the night.  Several days later comes the news of the theft of half a million pounds' worth of jewels in London.<br />Inspector French works to solve two interconnected mysteries: how did the death occur and how were the jewels stolen.  A tad of good luck and weeks of patient alibi checking and site scrutinizing lead to the solution, the cut to the chase, and the final page of a satisfying vintage crime novel.	2003-07-12

Its reception was just sufficient to open the way for the publication of more of her novels, and the next to be published was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It has been a matter of speculation ever since whether, if nothing other than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" had been published, Jane Austen would be remembered today.<br />Those who believe this novel would not have sustained her reputation offer several reasons. They cite a lack of comic characters, a lack of male characters who excite interest or stimulate the imagination, an overabundance of unmemorable minor characters, and prose that is sometimes too heavily overworked.<br />Those who believe this novel could alone preserve Jane Austen's fame produce different arguments. They cite the depiction of the two sisters Elinor and Marianne and their approximation to the concepts of sense and sensibility, the famous passage near the beginning in which the wife of John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother, pares down the deathbed promise her husband made to his father to provide financial support to John's half-sisters, and to Jane Austen's detached but involved, good-humored but stern narrative stance.<br />Having re-read the novel recently for the umpteenth time, I could see the merit in all these arguments. Nevertheless the reading experience held me enthralled. Accounting for this is difficult. I read hundreds of pages in which women talk about men. I read of a world where every quality, every characteristic, every manner is put in little boxes, clearly labeled, and arranged in order from desirable to base. These things do not usually appeal to me. Ultimately, I believe it is Jane Austen the storyteller that casts the spell. My sense and sensibility are alike spellbound.<br />Readers who like to refer to film or television adaptations to help their reading of the classics, will benefit from seeing a 1995 version of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" adapted, scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson.scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson.	2003-07-08

Although generally regarded as typifying the cozy murder mystery writer in whose books there is either a murder in a locked room or a murder at a family reunion in a country house, Agatha Christie rarely tried her hand at either of these murder mystery genres.  In \\"Hercule Poirot's Christmas\\", however, she combines both.<br />The family is the dysfunctional Lee family, summoned to pass Christmas together in the house of old Simeon Lee, the patriarch.  During this stressful reunion, a commotion followed by a blood-curdling scream is heard from the room on the first floor occupied by old Simeon.  When the locked door is forced open, the furniture is found upended, the safe rifled, and Simeon is found lying dead with his throat cut.  The door key is in place, on the inside of the door.<br />Having depicted how the family members despise, hate, or resent each other up to this point, Agatha Christie next allows the investigations and theories to develop.  Poirot is on hand, but she cleverly allows other police inspectors and investigators to do most of the work and make most of the mistakes.<br />The solution is one you will never forget, but also one that you will probably never arrive at before Poirot reveals all.  Agatha Christie is wonderfully clever at laying out all the clues in an arrangement that directs the reader away from the vital ones.<br />Apart from a few lines of description, almost everything in the text is dialogue.  To anyone in the world who has not yet read this 1940 mystery nothing more need be said.  To those who are re-reading it, I suggest they notice how cleverly it is plotted and planned.	2003-05-21

The novel opens in the old house of Starvel on a gloomy September afternoon in a remote part of Yorkshire.  By Page 17 the house is burnt down, and by Page 20 the charred remains of its three inmates are discovered.<br />An atmosphere of gloom and dreariness is maintained throughout this novel.  The house fire is found to be the result of arson, the inmates to have been murdered, and a vast amount of money to have been stolen.  By Page 46 Detective Inspector French takes over the case, and we follow his investigations thereafter.<br />Renowned for his narrative and plot construction skills, even by 1927 when this his seventh mystery novel appeared, Crofts uses the resources of melodrama here rather than drawing on his expertise in engineering which he was later to utilize so brilliantly. We are given, however one glimpse of a 1920s railway train.  \\"The huge engine with its high-pitched boiler and stumpy funnel rolled slowly past, followed by coach after coach, brightly lighted, luxurious, gliding smoothly by.\\"  More often encountered are dastardly murders, deadly rivalries, exhumations, and villains in disguise.  Typical 1920s detection procedures are employed.  Useful identifications are obtained from taxi drivers, and from bank tellers who record the numbers of bank notes of large denominations.  Slowly but surely French has his man cornered and is ready to call \\"Check Mate\\" when something totally unexpected happens.<br />Readers who enjoy sampling mysteries from the \\"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\" should not overlook this one.  As usual Crofts' plain but fluent story telling makes for easy reading.  Each sentence dovetails perfectly into its neighbors, as is the way in good storytelling.	2003-05-20

South central Asia, the focus of the worlds attention in 2003, received an earlier share of it in the 1870s.  For centuries travelers tales and the mention of such exotic names as Samarcand, Tashkent and Bokhara had aroused interest and fired imaginations.  To all this was added rumor in 1875 that British interests in India were threatened by Russian expansionism.  In particular, it was believed that Russian forces were massing in the recently occupied city of Khiva, nowadays in Uzbekistan, in preparation for an invasion of India.<br />A situation like this fitted perfectly the kind of investigative reporting adventures that Frederick Burnaby craved.  In 1876, this 33-year-old captain in the British army took leave of absence, and set out for Khiva.  The journey involved a ride of over one thousand miles in well below freezing conditions across steppes and wastelands.<br />On his return, Burnaby wrote A Ride to Khiva and it instantly became a best seller.  A well-educated man, proficient in many languages, and a keen observer of all he encountered, his account still ranks as one of the great adventure classics of literature.<br />I am grateful to the neighbor who lent me this book, and can report that reading it has provided many hours of fascination.  Burnaby died ten years after writing this book, supposedly during a massacre in the Sudan.  Keen Internet browsers might find reference to a recent revelation that throws doubt upon the truth of the official account of his death.	2003-04-28

For about forty years, English writer and critic H R F Keating has been mining the rich vein of gentle humor and rickety policing that the rest of the world associates with the culture of Bombay and other parts of India.  His police officer is Inspector Ghote.  At the time he initiated his series of 21 Inspector Ghote books, Keating had never set foot in India.  I am not sure whether he has since explored the real India he has so well evoked in his fiction.<br />Bribery, Corruption Also dates from Keatings early seventies.  Inspector Ghote, once pedaling a bicycle to investigate crime, is now being driven around Calcutta searching for a house his wife has inherited.  If time and action move slowly in his other Ghote books, they amble at an even slower pace here.  Expect leisurely narrative rather than cliffhangers on every page.  Expect only one minor murder rather than serial killings.  And expect Anglo-Indian dialogue such as this: We are knowing you now.

Almost every formula, idea, and trick that Agatha Christie used in her detective fiction works proved to be entirely successful and won her an enormous reading public.  Making use of nursery rhymes was one such formula.  Nursery rhymes can reawaken the sense of wonder, mystery and enchantment in any reader.  They also can carry symbolic levels of meaning, and some are allegories.<br />In this her 1953 offering she makes use of the nursery rhyme &#8220;Sing A Song Of Sixpence&#8221;.  Appropriately it is one  of her Miss Marple books.  Although her elderly spinster sleuth has little to do here, and is late making her appearance, it is she who perceives and urges the significance of the nursery rhyme.  &#8220;Don&#8217;t you see, it makes a pattern to all this.&#8221;<br />The murders occur in the disfunctional family of Rex Fortescue, a financier, and the action occurs in his London office and in the family home, Yew Tree Lodge.  The opening chapters are wonderfully engaging.  Agatha Christie, when she took the trouble, could sketch characters vividly.  Amongst all of them in this book, there are not more than a handful of suspects.  To compensate, Mrs Christie throws in buckets full of red herrings.<br />You&#8217;ll enjoy the puzzle, and having innumerable theories suggested and dismissed.  The solution, when it comes, however, is no more plausible than is the likelihood of a blackbird pecking off a maid&#8217;s nose.	2003-03-31

Just as immense profits seem assured, a blackmail letter is received. To the crime of smuggling the young men then add the crime of murder, but even this proves not enough to secure their safety.<br />Admirers of old-fashioned detective fiction containing a mix of escapism, ingenious plotting, and problem solving will welcome this reissue of \\"Anything To Declare?\\". Its publication in 1957 occurred at about the time of the author's death. Ill health had slowed Crofts' production rate. It had been five years since his previous novel appeared, and there are signs in this one, especially towards the end, that his energy was flagging. Almost every situation and every detection trick included here may be found in his earlier books. One new trick, however, appropriate to a writer with a long experience in railways, is the tracing of a suspect by checking the halves of return railway tickets collected at a railway station. It was known when and where a suspect alighted from a train, but where did he begin the journey? Because each half ticket has the place of origin printed on it, the search area is reduced, and the question is soon answered.<br />Freeman Wills Crofts, and his Inspector French, move into final retirement after this book.	2003-03-22

The secret is discovered, but attempts to utilize it and to fake the cause of the night watchman's death seem to bring more problems than the initial threat of bankruptcy.<br />This is the situation that Crofts creates in the early part of this superb novel, and which he sets his Chief Detective French to detect. All the writer's best attributes are displayed here: meticulous plot construction, the time-tabling and checking of alibis, the familiarity with chemical processes, and the fine descriptions of locations on and around the Isle of Wight.

For adult railway enthusiasts, here's a reissue of the complete detective fiction works of his contemporary, Freeman Wills Crofts.<br />Crofts&#8217; 1932 novel Death On the Way is an engrossing mystery yarn, not for children but for adults who like reading about railways and steam trains.  Crofts himself was for thirty years a railways construction engineer.  For detective fiction enthusiasts who like a good old-fashioned great train mystery, there is nobody so well qualified or who does it better than Freeman Wills Crofts.<br />In Chapter 2, here&#8217;s how he describes being in the cab of a steam engine: -<br />&#8220;The beam of light from  the partly opened firebox door, now continuously white from the rapid beat, shone out on the front of the tender and up above it onto the roof of the cab.  From these it was reflected back over the faceplate, or end of the boiler, showing up the maze of pipes and handles, gauges and dials, and bringing out unexpected highlights from polished brasswork.&#8221;<br />Contraband, forgery, swindles - these are usually the crimes being investigated in Crofts&#8217; novels.  The swindle here involves altering documents, earth work quantities, and the widening of a railway.  Crofts has the knack of inventing plausible swindles which can and do bring a measure of success and riches to the perpetrators.  Accordingly, uncovering the swindle and detecting the culprits is often and long and laborious task for his sleuth Inspector French.  French has a liking for railways timetables.  When interviewing a suspect he says, &#8220;Now I wonder could you put times on to it all?  I like things set out in the form of a railway timetable.&#8221;<br />Crofts plots and plans everything with perfect engineering precision.

It was a time when the second world war had brought widespread misery, pain and austerity.  A welcome antidote, therefore was to devise a little budget-priced escapism, to depict a group of guests at a sea-side holiday resort relaxing and exchanging gossip and tittle-tattle as they overlook a beach and the bathers who are using it.<br />The inane gossip and the lack of suspense in the opening pages might wear your patience, but keep alert!  Many significant clues are scattered here.<br />The subsequent murder and the possible motivation relate mainly to a context of human relationships.  A drug smuggling racket is occasionally suggested.  Hercule Poirot is present, of course, to lead police, readers, and everybody else to the solution of the mystery, even if he needs to ruin a good pair of shoes and risk seasickness during the hunt.<br />Addictive and ingenious as her books can be, Agatha Christie's prose and dialogue are not renowned for literary merit.  All the more remarkable, therefore, is the contribution of David Suchet. Such is the reading of the great British actor that the banal is transformed into the brilliant, the commonplace into the courtly, and the mediocre into the memorable.	2003-03-07

At the age of 79, when this book was published, Agatha Christie was not capable of producing the tighly-plotted, ingenious puzzle fiction that poured from her pen when she was 39. When one is the world's most published author of all time, however, and when one is still able to hold a pen, the pressure to keep producing yet another 'Christie for Christmas' cannot be discounted. It was to be several years before Agatha Christie's daughter said, 'Now, that is enough, Mum'. This is clearly an elderly author at work here, cunningly presenting characters who are mainly elderly themselves, who can get away lines like, 'You know what young people are like nowadays,' and who tend to end sentences with 'and that sort of thing'. Nevertheless, she provides much of the fun and challenge that you expect in her mystery novels, whatever their date of publication.<br />Her popular creations Hercule Poirot and Ariadne Oliver get yet another airing here, as they investigate the drowning in an apple-bobbing tub of a thirteen-year-old girl at a children's Hallowe'en party, a girl who not long before had boasted that she had once witnessed a murder. Exploring the possibility that the girl were telling the truth, Poirot probes several local deaths and disappearances. Amongst vague and gossipy eldery characters, and unbelievably articulate and poetic adolescents, Poirot makes his way with waxed moustache and patent leather shoes to a solution to the mystery.<br />Agatha Christie repeats many of the tricks she tried in her earlier books. You will find echoes of children's nursery rhymes here and a crime that occurs in a familiar domestic setting. You'll also find an especially lyrical few pages in praise of gardens, mid-way through the novel. Agatha Christie, a garden enthusiast herself, never wrote anything better than these few pages.<br />So expect late vintage Christie here. You may not like the attempt at a nail-biting finish, but you can still respect the author's way of setting up a baffling mystery.a baffling mystery.	2003-01-09

It has special value as a record of a time and a place - Sydney, Australia in the 1890s - but it has a universal relevance.<br />Eug&eacute;nie McNeil, in her 80s, impressed her daughter with the sharpness and clarity of her childhood recollections.  Her daughter, Eug&eacute;nie Crawford, wrote down all she heard as her mother reminisced.  This little book, first published in 1972, is the result.  If reminiscences gleaned from the elderly are often of limited and local interest, this makes an exception.  You will meet an array of sharply observed characters, depicted with wit, charm, and a wicked sense of humour.<br />One such is a rarely seen middle-aged bachelor, Mr Chapman.  His annual appearance proved to be the most popular item at the local church social.  \\"He carefully drew and line down the middle of his face and blackened one side.

Coils of wire and boxes of hand grenades are reported missing from a Home Guard ammunition store at a Cornish coastal village. Soon after an explosion on the beach nearby kills an old man, and later there is a similar murder.<br />This is a grimmer, more static mystery than Crofts usually provided, no doubt reflecting the harsh \\"war conditions\\" in which it is set and written. One of the characters is a writer of detective fiction. He provides illuminating views of the craft of which Crofts was a master.	2002-12-17

You'll guess neither whodunit nor how it was done.  You'll be in good company.  Freeman Wills Crofts' regular sleuth, Detective Inspector French of Scotland Yard, is also unable to solve the mystery.<br />The owner and manager of a large English engineering business invites his Australian nephew to inherit the management.  The owner's other descendants are forced to make way for this \\"outsider\\" from abroad.  At a dinner party, all the family members are poisoned, the Australian nephew most severely, but all recover.  To aid recovery, a Mediterranean cruise is recommended.  It is during this cruise that a murder occurs and Inspector French is called to investigate.<br />The big bonus here, for \\"Golden Age\\" detective fiction enthusiasts, is the opportunity to enjoy a Mediterranean cruise.  Crofts provides descriptions of each port and the excursions available.  An engineer by training, he depicts not only ship-board tourist life above decks but also provides fascinating looks at engine rooms, bridges, propellers, etc.<br />I found the latter part of this 1937 novel a little tiresome.  It is always more fun to follow French as he solves a mystery than to read chapter after chapter in which he is forced to discard theory after theory.  Nevertheless this is, on balance, one of the most ingenious and imaginative yarns from a very readable author.	2002-12-09

I am glad to find so many favorable reviews of this, Dorothy L Sayers' final detective fiction novel, on the internet.  It failed to find much favor with the public or the critics when it was written in the late 1930s.  In actual need of the income that her earlier works in this genre had generated (she had to support not only herself but also a non-productive husband and an illegitimate son), she negotiated with her publisher to \\"once again try my hand at detective fiction\\" after he had pointed out that the market seemed to have become saturated.<br />Just as a busman's holiday is a vacation where the busman is likely to be as involved with driving as he is throughout the rest of the year, a busman's honeymoon (a phrase which she coined) is one where the busman (in this case Lord Peter Wimsey) is likely to spend his honeymoon checking alibis, interviewing murder suspects, observing rigor mortis, and all the other tiresome activities of an amateur detective.<br />Lord Peter and Harriet Vane are the honeymooners.  After their wedding (reported in a series of letters that begin the novel), they travel to \\"Talboys\\", a country house chosen by Harriet.  Their reception is not as predicted.  Eventually Lord Peter's butler, Bunter, discovers a corpse in the cellar.<br />The novel began life as a play, as you may infer from the many static scenes involving a large ensemble of characters entering and exiting.  The prose is as rich in wit, classical illusions and sophistication as you will ever encounter in detective fiction.  Dorothy L. Sayers was an honours graduate and capable of writing as well as George Eliot.<br />Don't expect the kind of fast food satisfaction that Agatha Christie provided so successfully.  You will find instead the full silver service dining and wining experience here.	2002-12-07

It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible. Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.<br />The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing. Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize. Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed. Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.<br />Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable. How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt? I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley. How did it begin? It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.<br />Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership. Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly. Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours.	2002-11-24

Readers of old-fashioned, can't put it down detective yarns can be grateful to British publishers, The House of Stratus, for republishing in a uniform edition of 35 volumes the complete detection novels and short stories of Freeman Wills Crofts. Crofts was one of the supreme masters of plot construction in this genre. Raymond Chandler praised Crofts' plots, calling him \\"the soundest builder of them all\\". Crofts began his literary career with his masterpiece \\"The Cask\\" in 1920. He produced, on average, one book a year during the rest of his life. \\"Sudden Death\\" was his 1932 production. If the detective fiction genre can de divided into categories, then this book belongs to the \\"locked room\\" category. Two deaths occur in locked rooms in the same house. Each is assumed to be suicide but Inspector French discovers them to be murders.<br />Ingenious as is the plotting and planning, I must say that (a rare occurrence for me) I was easily able to guess the identity of the murderer long before arriving at the final chapter. The reading and the guessing was pure pleasure throughout, of course, and I guarantee they will be for you too.	2002-11-20

I have already received twelve of the thirty-five volumes in the uniform series. After years of browsing in antiquarian books shops and searching in their catalogues, it is wonderful to have and to read some of these long out of print detective yarns.<br />This one, &quot;The Ponson Case&quot; was the author's second production, and dates from 1921. When you see that Chapter One is entitled &quot;Mystery at Luce Manor&quot; you expect that this will be a classic whodunit featuring the butler, the boathouse and the brandy before bedtime, and that the reading experience will be much like playing the board game &quot;Cleudo&quot;. Well, there is plenty of the traditional whodunit fun to enjoy here. Mysteries are solved and dissolved, alibis are offered and tested, timetables are constructed and checked. The investigation is co-ordinated by a Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Tanner, although some amateur sleuthing also occurs.<br />Crofts' mastery of plot construction is evident here, the traditional narrative formulas receive a fresh handling, there are unexpected twists aplenty, and plodding detection work is made fascinating.<br />You will enjoy opening &quot;The Ponson Case&quot; and be sorry when it is closed.	2002-11-19

The book is one of her shorter mysteries but one of the most cunningly devised.  Adept at constructing puzzles, she opts for presenting this one as a first person narrative.  The narrator is a young man recuperating from a flying accident, told by his doctor that he must \\"go and live in the country and lead the life of a vegetable for at least six months\\".  With his sister he rents a cottage in a small English village \\"of no importance whatsoever\\".<br />Accordingly, when the poison pen letters begin circulating, it is this narrator, a stranger to the village, who decribes things as he sees them, retails all the local gossip, and reports everyone's suspicions about the writer of the letters.  A murder and an apparent suicide follow, and we read of the efforts of the local police to investigate.<br />Miss Marple thus is introduced late in the book and, of course, she proves better at solving the mystery than everybody else.  You will be an astute and alert reader if you discover whodunit before Miss Marple reveals all.	2002-11-19

Author Freeman Wills Crofts acknowledges in a brief forward that this 1938 detective story is a two-fold experiment.  It is firstly an attempt to tell the story from two perspectives.  During the first part of the book we accompany an accomplice in a crime of murder.  During the remainder we accompany Detective Inspector French as he unravels the crime.  It is secondly an attempt to present the defense case for someone who finds the temptation to assist with a murder to be more than he can resist.<br />More than 60 years later, readers will probably find the second attempt to be the more successful and interesting part of the twofold experiment.  It was a brave experiment to make in the 1930s, when the notion that crime does not pay was still one of the understood rules in the game of detective fiction.<br />Crofts allows us to understand the temptation to commit crime by presenting the book's principal character, George Surridge.  A middle-aged director of a zoo, unhappy in his marriage, and facing increasing debts, his situation becomes desperate when he falls in love with Nancy Weymore, who represents his only prospect of happiness.  He lives dangerously for some time, trusting that a legacy that will come to him after the death of an elderly aunt will allow him to escape to happiness.<br />The aunt dies, he is named as legatee, and then comes the most unexpected shock.  The shock occurs half way through the book, and the suspense leading up to it is as skillfully wrought as in any Alfred Hitchcock movie.<br />Crofts' sleuth, Inspector French, takes centre stage thereafter, and for once his forming and checking of theories, his alibi-cracking, and his time-table measuring seems less interesting than usual.<br />Nevertheless, this is certainly one of Crofts' best stories.  I would not argue with readers or reviewers who might think it deserves a five star rating.	2002-11-18

It was T S Eliot who described Wilkie Collins' \\"The Moonstone\\" as \\"the first, the longest, and the best of Modern English detective novels\\".  Not everybody might agree with this, but all practitioners, readers, and fans of detective fiction will find much to admire and enjoy in this magnificent 1868 publication.<br />Although not exactly the first example of detection novels, it provides the archetypal sleuth, Sergeant Cuff, an astute though idiosyncratic detective who leads the chase to the solution of the mystery, easily surpassing the dim-witted local police authorities.  It also explores the full potential of the whodunit formula.<br />Arguably, it is still the longest example of detective fiction.  Unlike most other serialized novels of its era, this one is meticulously plotted.  You'll find red herrings, suspense, the unexpected, climaxes that overwhelm or fizzle out, and a satisfying denouement.  It is narrated largely by some of the principal characters.  All are revealed in well-rounded perspective while carrying forward the story line.  The most popular has always been Drusilla Clack, \\"that rampant spinster\\", a self-righteous tract-dispensing lady who likes to eavesdrop and to be judgmental.<br />Is it the best?  I would unhesitatingly award it the prize, while welcoming other internet browsers to name other contenders.<br />Wealthy internet browsers are recommended to download the unabridged audio reading of the book.  It is a novel that reads well, and the full length reading available is a model of its kind.  Naxos has produced an abridged version. It has the benefit of multiple readers, but most of the charm and all the atmosphere seems to disappear in the abridgment process.

The mid 1930s were some of the best years of the so-called \\"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\" in Britain. Most practitioners belonged to the Detection Club, they reviewed and promoted one another's books publically and privately they shared and re-worked one another's ideas. An example of this literary cross-fertilization may be seen when Freeman Wills Crofts' \\"The 12.30 From Croydon\\", 1934, and \\"Agatha Christie's \\"Death In the Clouds\\", 1935, are compared. Both books begin with a passenger plane flight across the English Channel. In the former novel, a passenger is found to be dead at the end of Chapter One when the plane touches down in Paris. In the latter, a passenger is found to be dead at the end of Chapter One when a plane touches down in London. Thereafter, and indeed in the titling of the two books, each writer develops the idea differently.<br />Agatha Christie devises a whodunit puzzle. Characters are displayed in terms of how they appear physically, in their dialogue, by reputation or hearsay. Clues and significant red herrings are tossed about so that the murderer might mislead everybody else, and the writer might mislead the reader. Just how misleading appearances might be, is cleverly contrived at one point in this book when a jury at an inquest into the passenger's death return a unanimous verdict of murder at the hands of another passenger, namely Hercule Poirot.<br />Agatha Christie, who lived to become the world's best-selling author, presents her puzzle in immensely readable but unsophisticated prose. The two dimensional characters are somehow easy to keep in mind as you strive to guess the murderer's identity and, of course, there is Hercule Poirot to unerringly point the finger. He can also voice a note of compassion with his oft repeated, \\"Ah, yes, life can be terribly cruel\\".<br />\\"Death In the Clouds\\" is recommended for reading during prolonged international flights or sleepless nights as an escape from stressful reality.

Both books begin with a passenger plane flight across the English Channel.  In the former novel, a passenger is found to be dead at the end of Chapter One when the plane touches down in Paris.  In the latter, a passenger is found to be dead at the end of Chapter One when a plane touches down in London.  Thereafter, and indeed in the titling of the two books, each writer develops the idea differently.  <br />Agatha Christie devises a whodunit puzzle.  Characters are displayed in terms of how they appear physically, in their dialogue, by reputation or hearsay.  Clues and significant red herrings are tossed about so that the murderer might mislead everybody else, and the writer might mislead the reader.  Just how misleading appearances might be, is cleverly contrived at one point in this book when a jury at an inquest into the passenger&#8217;s death return a unanimous verdict of murder at the hands of another passenger, namely Hercule Poirot.<br />Agatha Christie, who lived to become the world&#8217;s best-selling author, presents her puzzle in immensely readable but unsophisticated prose.  The two dimensional characters are somehow easy to keep in mind as you strive to guess the murderer&#8217;s identity and, of course, there is Hercule Poirot to unerringly point the finger.  He can also voice a note of compassion with his oft repeated, &#8220;Ah, yes, life can be terribly cruel&#8221;.  <br />&#8220;Death In the Clouds&#8221; is recommended for reading during prolonged international flights or sleepless nights as an escape from stressful reality.  Don&#8217;t begin it, however, if you need a full night&#8217;s sleep.  It is possible you will want to keep reading through to the last page.	2002-10-10

Those who like their crime fiction to be well written, from yesteryear, and narrated with a wry sense of humour, ought to sample the works of Cyril Hare being newly reprinted by the House of Stratus.  Cyril Hare was the pseudonym for an English county court judge, Gordon Clark (1900-1957).  He wrote 11 or 12 detective novels during the last 20 years of his life.  This one was published in 1954.<br />Hare's regular sleuth, retired lawyer Francis Pettigrew, solves the murder mystery.  Like the author, he knows all about \\"draughty town halls, where inaudible witnesses compete vainly with the roar of traffic outside, and stuffy police courts loud with the clamour of imprisoned stray dogs\\".  The victim seems to be an unlikely candidate for murder.  She is a relatively new arrival in the village.  She rents a house.  She is killed while delivering notices advertising a forthcoming bazaar.  All very English.  As Pettigrew, and members of the local police force discover, however, many people had both opportunity and a motive for killing her.<br />This is recommended for the fastidious reader, not for those seeking thrills, suspense, and excitement.	2002-10-05

Blandings Castle, Shropshire, England, is the setting for many of Wodehouse's comic extravaganzas.  Accommodated in many of its 52 bedrooms is a varied collection of dotty relatives of Clarence, ninth Earl of Emsworth.  Clarence himself, dottier than any of them, dotes on the Empress of Blandings, an enormous prize-winning sow, and is usually to be seen, day or night, leaning over the wall of her sty.  Nagged by his sister Connie, bewildered by his many American visitors and in-laws, and dazed by the complicated comings and goings of the many moon-faced young men and dizzy young damsels whom he encounters in the castle and its grounds, he is steered safely through life by a dedicated butler.<br />Of course it all means nothing at all, and the characters are no more than comic cartoon figures, but the quality of the writing is superb.  Metaphors, similes, classical allusions, sparkling dialogue - you'll find every component of stylish writing on display here.<br />If you are lucky enough to be able to buy, beg, borrow or download Nigel Lambert's reading of the text in audio book form, you'll find every component of the art of book reading on display also.

Of her fellow practitioner in the \\"Golden Age\\" of detective fiction, Agatha Christie wrote, \\"Then there is Freeman Wills Crofts with his wonderful timetables\\".  Well, Crofts and his wonderful timetables can be enjoyed in this 1933 mystery which takes its name from a ridge of land in Surrey, England.  To this part of Surrey come two women to stay with a third who is married to a retired doctor.  All the women were at school together, and soon they are arranging to meet others former school friends living nearby.  Add the obligatory retired colonel, a neighbouring household where live the young widow and a nephew of a recently deceased elderly gentleman, a few suggestions of extra-marital affairs, and you'll deduce that a murder is not many pages away.<br />Actually several disappearances precede the discovery of murder, disappearances that are investigated by Crofts' indefatigable detective Inspector French of Scotland Yard.<br />Those who have disappeared prove so difficult to trace, and alibis so hard to crack, that French and the reader need to work and watch keenly through some slow moving investigation.  Persistence is rewarded, however, and Crofts is seen to have devised yet another fascinating puzzle to solve.	2002-07-11

Mrs Emmeline Lucas, known in her community as Lucia, \\"reigns supreme over the affairs of Riseholme\\".  Riseholme is a one main street village in rural England in the year 1920.  The \\"affairs of Riseholme\\" involve leisured eccentrics who devote their energies and time to the favorite pastimes, hobbies, fads and fancies of the day.  It is Lucia's role as leader to take responsibility for heightening an awareness and questing for greater cultural richness.  Not that she admits to this, even to herself.  \\"You all work me to death,\\" she usually says, when a new opportunity for leading a crusade or instigating a new field of cultural endeavor presents itself.<br />Of course, Lucia's stance provokes great rivalry.  Riseholmeites do not so much relate to each other as try to put each other down.  Many are put down, and many fall down when they tread on those metaphorical banana skins that fate seems to spread before those who are absurdly over-ambitious<br />Using this material, E F Benson, begins an inter-related series of novels with this one in 1920.  He devises an almost mock-heroic quality in the telling of his tale.  Benson makes us aware that no great legendary conqueror gave as much thought and weight to the planning of a military conquest as do the Riseholmeites to the consideration of who to invite for afternoon tea.<br />The result is gentle satire and great fun from beginning to end.  Not a day, not an hour, passes in Riseholme without plots being hatched, news being sought, and allegiances being formed.<br />I don't recommend that you present this book as a gift to you football-playing, beer-swilling, macho male friends and relations.  It is for those who enjoy the word spinning of an Oscar Wilde, mixed with the sophistication of a Noel Coward.<br />English actress Geraldine McEwan, who played the role of Lucia in a TV mini-series based on this series of books, has recorded this and others in the series in audio book format.

Having almost completed chronicling the ecclesiastical affairs of Barchester in 1864, Anthony Trollope began a further series of six novels, this time depicting the English political scene of his day in general and the members of the Palliser family in particular.<br />This one, the first of the six novels, carries a title that carries no hint of any political content whatsoever.  Indeed, the \\"her\\" of the title is a perverse young lady, Alice, who refuses for almost 900 pages to marry the man whom all agree is so eminently suitable.  Alice is one of at least four women that Trollope presents, all of whom struggle to answer the question, \\"What should a woman do with her life?\\"  As usual with his female characters, Trollope is a sensitive, sure and unsentimental narrator.  The business of the men, and the political issues they address, seem to consist in keeping solvent, gaining a seat and an office in parliament, and sniffing out any parliamentary intrigues.  All of which might suggest that this is one early Victorian novel that today's feminists could pick up, read, and enjoy.<br />I enjoy any Trollope novel immensely.  No matter how slow moving, no matter how often he intrudes to comment on his characters and tell us what he does and does not know about them, every page of his novels and perhaps every sentence carries the stamp of a great novelist and language craftsman at work.  Nevertheless, I must admit that \\"Can You Forgive Her?\\" has featured by my bedside for more than a year.  This is not, therefore, a recommendation for something to quickly and thrillingly absorb the reader.  It takes a long time to get to the novelist's final words, \\"But as they all ... have forgiven her, I hope that they who have followed her story to its close will not be less generous\\".	2002-06-24

Miss Maud Hephzibah Silver made her first appearance in 1929, predating Agatha Christie's more famous Miss Marple.  Thereafter her creator, Patricia Wentworth, spelled her until 1937, when she allowed her a second appearance, in this book, \\"The Case Is Closed\\".  She featured in only six of the book's 36 chapters, but the author never again allowed her a holiday, employing her in all her subsequent mystery novels.<br />Patricia Wentworth depicts her Miss Silver with a comic touch.  The retired governess -  with her polite cough, her occasional exclamation of \\"Dear Me!\\", her propensity to quote the poetry of Alfred Lord Tennyson, her knitting of baby clothes while conducting a consultation, her hen-like manner of running, and her quaint taste in clothing - is delineated with sure satirical skill.  There is never a touch of wit or satire in the presentation of any other character in this novel, however.  The earnest, the threatening, the tortured, the traumatized - the other characters seem to belong in the world of nightmares.<br />Indeed, much of the atmosphere here has the attributes of a nightmare.  Hilary, the heroine convinced that her cousin's husband has been wrongly convicted of his uncle's murder seems to be living a nightmare.  In strange, eerie ways she chances upon clues, and she seems to be relentlessly pursued by a monster of evil.  Attempts to escape one threat land her in an even worse one.  Dimensions have a nightmarish quality too.  Happening to be in Glasgow, Hilary is somehow able to perceive the face of a character whose whereabouts she did not know at the fifth floor window of a large block of tenements.  She can see, moreover, an expression of anguish and terror on the face.  She feels impelled to climb the many flights of evil-smelling stairs to rescue, aid, question and investigate.  Of course, a near death experience awaits her.  These are absurd coincidences and impossibilities yet all are true to a nightmare mode...Patricia Wentworth wrote dozens of Miss Silver mysteries.e dozens of Miss Silver mysteries.	2002-05-09

It is almost 200 years since \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" was first published. It ought to be the equivalent in literature of those faded, dried flowers that used to be found pressed between the pages of the old family bible.  Instead it is redolent of freshly cut flowers still carrying a sprinkling of morning dew.  <br />The freshness and the perfection of form are certainly astonishing.  Jane Austin is as good as story teller as ever picked up a pen, knowing exactly how to construct plots, and what incidents and dialogues to detail in full and what to briefly summarize.  Her \\"world\\" is small but intricately constructed.  Every characteristic, quality and idea has a precise and fixed value, all being ranked strictly and sternly according to decorum, logic and morality.  <br />Despite its architectural perfection, however, a recent re-reading reveals one or two construction features that are questionable.  How could it be, for example that Fitzwilliam Darcy could have such a dragon for an aunt?  I also wonder about the friendship between Darcy and Bingley.  How did it begin?  It is obviously important to each, but we are given nothing of its history.  <br />Jane Austen lived long enough to see this book published and enjoyed amongst her own family and a small readership.  Her mother entertained family members with it, reading it, in Jane Austen's estimation, a little too quickly.  Distinguished British actress Lindsay Duncan reads it with perfect timing and inflexion in this highly recommended audio tape format, which presents the novel in an unabridged version of just over twelve hours.	2002-03-14

To readers of detective fiction, there is a special fascination in following the sleuth as he cracks the apparently unbreakable alibi.  The fascination is heightened if we are shown both how the crime was committed and how the alibi was constructed.<br />Master plot builder Freeman Wills Crofts provides both these perspectives and more in this vintage 1943 Inspector French mystery.  An especially ingenious method of obtaining evidence and pinning the crime to the killer is included.  Suspicious footprints are found, enough to measure the stride and the angles.  Suspects are called to Scotland Yard to assist with a feigned identity parade.  On the way to the parade they are ushered, one at a time, across an outside yard that has recently been hosed down.

Having worn mayoral robes himself, it is not surprising that writer E F Benson should have allowed readers of his Lucia novels to see how that scheming, contriving, arch social climbing lady would do the same when elected as the first lady mayor of the quaint village of Tilling.  As the book&#8217;s title suggests, donning the mayoral robes brings trouble for Lucia.  She foresees that most of it is likely to derive from her arch rival for supremacy in local affairs, Miss Mapp.  Accordingly she decides to  make Elizabeth Mapp her mayoress.  &#8220;It is far better to have her on a lead, bound to me by ties of gratitude that skulking about like a pariah dog, snapping at me,&#8221; she tells her husband, Georgie Pillson.<br />Of course the dog lead soon becomes more like the rope in a tug of war as the two rivals strive to topple each other.

This might supplement the comments offered in the many interesting reviews provided by other internet users.  It might also warn admirers of eminent crime writer P D James that they may not find what they expect in this 1992 novel.

The secret is discovered, but attempts to utilize it and to fake the cause of the night watchman's death seem to bring more problems than the initial threat of bankruptcy. <br />This is the situation that Crofts creates in the early part of this superb novel, and which he sets his Chief Detective French to detect. All the writer's best attributes are displayed here: meticulous plot construction, the time-tabling and checking of alibis, the familiarity with chemical processes, and the fine descriptions of locations on and around the Isle of Wight. What is not here is the \\"love interest\\" that Crofts usually felt obliged to incorporate into his novels.  This one is pure detective fiction.  Most of the tricks used by mystery writers of the time are here. There's an additional one that is new to me.

Newspaper readers were invited recently to submit their choices for the greatest works published in the English language.  When the choices were totalled, two works by Shakespeare featured in the top ten.  Also featured, I was pleased to see, was a novel by George Eliot. Internet users, familiar with her works, will probably guess which of her novels was chosen.  For those unfamiliar with her works, the best one to start with is \\"Silas Marner\\", a much shorter one.  It is short, it is easy, it even works well in schools (as I can testify), and yet it is undoubtedly a masterpiece.<br />George Eliot sets her 1861 novel in the early decades of the nineteenth century in rural England.  Silas Marner is a weaver. In the pattern that life weaves, he usually features as a victim.  Because he is unjustly \\"framed\\", he loses his reputation and his betrothed in the town where he grew up.  After years working as a weaver and living like a hermit in a rural district then, he is robbed by an unknown thief who uncovers and makes off with the cache  of gold guineas Silias keeps under his floor.  Happiness and joy come to Silas, however, and at the end of the novel he is told, \\"Nobody could be happier than we are\\".<br />George Eliot tells her tale with a mixture of womanly sympathy, sharp observation, tact, and humour.  Her depiction of a long-gone past, and her clear pointing of right and wrong impulses, give the story qualities that are sometimes found in morality plays or in fairy tales.  Don't skip over the scenes in the local inn, the Rainbow, where the simple-minded rustics discuss relevant issues, including the existence of ghosts.<br />For those who appreciate hearing good literature read aloud, I recommend the unabridged audio format of \\"Silas Marner\\" where the reader is Andrew Sachs.  As you might expect of this fine English actor, who made Manuel from Barcelona so memorable in \\"Fawlty Towers\\", he is especially wonderful in portraying the argumentative, credulous, muddle-headed rustics that foregather at the Rainbow.

He lived long enough to see his modest reputation fade, in contrast to that of many of his famous novelist contemporaries.  Nowadays the situation seems to be reversing.<br />Of special merit, amongst his huge output, are the so-called Barsetshire (\\"clerical\\") novels, and the so-called Palliser (\\"political\\") novels.  Of the former, the last and longest is \\"The Last Chronicle of Barset\\".  Not only are there fresh concerns, complications and current affairs introduced here, but there are also fond and final appearances of people and places encountered in the earlier Barsetshire novels.  Everybody's favourite literary virago, Mrs Proudie, is again denouncing and dominating everybody.  Trollope even contrives to create a character who has the temerity to say to her, \\"Peace, Woman!\\"<br />There are the innumerable characters of marriageable age, whose names are perhaps more memorable than their characters, whose charming dialogues and relationship problems are deftly laid out and interwoven.  Above all, there is master story-teller Anthony Trollope, admitting finally that for him Barset has been a real place, a place where he as been induced to wander too long by his \\"love of old friendships, and by the sweetness of old faces\\".<br />Superb TV and radio adaptations of Trollope's Barsetshire novels have appeared in recent years.

Her creation is Miss Maud Silver, a retired governess, who is constantly knitting, whose favourite reading is the Bible and Tennyson, who coughs discretely, and who never permits herself an exclamation more extravagant than \\"Dear me!\\".  She reappeared again in 1937, and featured in all Miss Wentworth's books thereafter.<br />Patricia Wentworth usually set her mystery novels in English villages, contriving somehow to introduce Miss Silver to the location, having her accompany or stay with suitable inhabitants, and forwarding the work of detection, usually in co-operation with a former pupil who is now head of the country constabulary.<br />With Miss Maud Silver, Patricia Wentworth is very successful, delineating her character with affection and amusement.  Another strength is the author's avoidance of the endless interviews and interrogations that often provide so much dead weight in detective fiction.  She also has a great love for old things, antiquities, and bric-a-brac, and perfumes her prose with them.  Otherwise there is not much to recommend.  You will find a great deal of \\"old fashioned romance\\", characters, dialogue and writing that are tediously commonplace and humourless, and little ingenuity or novelty in plot construction.<br />Miss Wentworth's books have attracted little interest from film or TV adaptors, and are only recently being added to the audio book range.  Having read twenty or so of her Miss Silver novels at one time or another, I reckon this to be typical of them although not the best.	2001-10-27

I can't think of any category of readership who could find a disappointing page in this marvellous book.  Elisabeth Schumann (1888-1952) proves to be a fascinating subject for a biography.  Feted and adored by a music loving public, especially in Vienna between the two world wars, she established a lasting reputation firstly as the ideal Sophie in Richard Strauss's \\"Der Rosenkavalier\\", then for her roles in Mozart operas, and then for her lieder recitals and recordings.  A woman who always wanted to be in love, her husbands included an architect, a conductor and a doctor.  Although circumstances kept them apart for much of their lives, Elisabeth Schumann experienced her greatest joy in her relationship with her son, Gerd Puritz.  \\"We were everything to each other\\", he comments.  Sadly, just when Elisabeth Schumann was arranging to make her home in England with her son, his English wife and their three children, she died suddenly in New York in 1952.<br />Gerd Puritz's biography of his mother did not appear until more than 40 years later.  While I regret the delay, and the larger readership it might have attracted earlier, the belated biography emerges as a thoroughly researched, scholarly, sturdily constructed and neatly edited work.  Included are many excellent photos and a fully detailed discography.  There's an obituary notice also, provided by Lotte Lehmann, which will bring a tear to any reader's eye.  It resulted from a forty year friendship, perhaps unique in the annals of the performing arts, which began unpromisingly when they both were being considered for the role of Sophie in \\"Der Rosenkavalier\\", and Elisabeth Schumann was chosen.<br />Her voice, which I heard only once in London's Royal Albert Hall, was as beautiful as any singer ever had.

I can report that the pleasure to be derived from it is increased ten fold by listening to Martin Jarvis reading it.  The voice is beautifully modulated, and apparently undamaged by forty years of theatre, TV, film and radio work.  Not only is the text beautifully read, but there are also many demonstrations of Martin's Jarvis's uncanny ability to mimic and adopt other voices.  You'll not only hear what Sir John Gielguid, Sir Alan Ayckbourn and Harold Pinter say, you actually believe they are there, speaking to you.  Even the great radio actress Marjorie Westbury, to whom Martin Jarvis pays a high tribute, is somehow heard again in Jarvis's reading.  There is also a Polish film director, and a Hollywood agent whose impersonations you will never forget.<br />Whether you're a theater enthusiast, an admirer of Martin Jarvis's work, a budding actor, or just someone who likes to be amused and entertained, you'll find this audio book set to be a great investment.	2001-10-22

Dorothy L Sayers provided some of the great treasures to be found in the so-called &quot;Golden Age of Detective Fiction&quot;. A classical scholar with a formidable intellect, she was an eminent practitioner and an eloquent critic of detective fiction. Her feisty, detective fiction writing character, Harriet Vane, and her aristocratic, monocled, amateur detective, Lord Peter Wimsey, may be found together for the second time in her 1932 novel &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;.<br />On a walking holiday, while recovering from a court case in which she was alleged to have killed her lover, Harriet Vane discovers the body of a man. It is lying on rocks on a beach, close to low tide level. The evidence suggests suicide. After taking photographs with her camera, finding a cut throat razor and removing a shoe from the corpse, Harriet vainly tries to enlist help in moving the body before it is washed away by the incoming tide. The local police force is alerted and so is Lord Peter Wimsey.<br />This is a long novel. Interest focuses not only on the solution to the mystery but also on the likelihood of Wimsey succeeding with his wish to marry Harriet. There is witty dialogue, there are fulsome reports from a range of eccentric characters, there are descriptions of the human anatomy and how it responds to the throat being cut, there is an interminable attempt to decode a ciphered letter, and there are classical quotations provided at the start of each chapter. There is little dramatic tension, no suspense, and no thrills. Dorothy L Sayers was a cultivated, fluent writer, sometimes boring but never banal.<br />If your tolerance of boredom is low, but your credit balance at the bank is high, then invest in the audio tape reading of the book provided by Ian Carmichael. English actor Ian Carmichael has had great success associated with various adaptations of the novels of Dorothy L Sayers. He brings wonderful energy and gusto to this full-length reading, enough to keep you delighted for more than fifteen hours.d for more than fifteen hours.	2001-10-03

Six young Englishmen contribute their various skills to the realization of a clever smuggling racket.  They invite holiday makers to take a yachting cruise up the River Rhine to Switzerland.  While the travellers are enjoying a few days ashore, before the return journey, illegal consignments of watches are smuggled aboard.  Just as immense profits seem assured, a blackmail letter is received.  To the crime of smuggling the young men  then add the crime of murder,  but even this proves not enough to secure their safety.<br />Admirers of old-fashioned detective fiction containing a mix of escapism, ingenious plotting, and problem solving will welcome this reissue of \\"Anything To Declare?\\".  Its publication in 1957 occurred at about the time of the author's death.  Ill health had slowed Crofts' production rate.  It had been five years since his previous novel appeared, and there are signs in this one, especially towards the end, that his energy was flagging.  Almost every situation and every detection trick included here may be found in his earlier books.  One new trick, however, appropriate to a writer with a long experience in railways, is the tracing of a suspect by checking the halves of return railway tickets collected at a railway station.  It was known when and where a suspect alighted from a train, but where did he begin the journey?  Because each half ticket has the place of origin printed on it, the search area is reduced, and the question is soon answered.  <br />Freeman Wills Crofts, and his Inspector French, move into final retirement after this book.	2001-09-19

Sir Roland Chatterton's country estate borders on the river Thames.  Close to the river is  \\"the joy of his heart\\" a sun trap bordered on three sides by evergreen shrubs and open on the other to the sun and the river.  Here, during fine periods of the summer, he has his chair placed and here he sits surrounded by his books and papers sometimes for his whole day.  On one such day, when members of his family and household are summoned to the sun trap by the sound of a gun shot, it appears that he has suicided.  This is the principal mystery around which Freeman Wills Crofts builds his 1949 book \\"Silence For the Murderer\\".  Allied to this mystery there is also a clever swindle perpetrated by two of the principal characters.  The swindle and the suicide are so ingeniously contrived by Crofts that their discovery and explanation, at the hands of Chief Inspector French, are almost too amazing to be believed.  There is also an amazing twist at the end of the book, when it seems that the case is well and truly solved.  Nearing the end of his detective fiction career, Crofts has here allowed less space for the  dogged detection, timetable checking formula he had used ever since 1920.  A love interest component occupies a considerable part of the book.  Chief Inspector French's entry is delayed until two third of the way through.	2001-08-31

Freeman Wills Crofts wrote his detective stories during the first half of the twentieth century. His readership at the time would have clear recollections of childhood hours spent with toy trains, Meccano sets and Chemistry sets. Much of the enjoyment in constructing and experimenting provided by these childhood pastimes may be found by adult readers of his books, then and now.<br />This one is in the Chemistry set category. At the heart of the mystery is a process for desalinating sea water.  This one is also an attempt by Crofts to try his hand at the \\"English Country House\\" murder mystery. All the stock characters are there - the unpopular host, the troubled wife and her secret lover, the nephew, the secretary, the laboratory worker, the butler, an aggrieved sacked employee, the chauffeur, the gardener, and a full staff of female domestics. Crofts' attempt is better written than most, and just as baffling as the best of them. His regular sleuth, Chief Detective Inspector French, is provided with an assistant named Rollo. This allows for a little raillery and sarcasm, as in this comment by French, \\"You'll find, Mr Inspector Rollo, that if you are to succeed at this game, you'll need all the wits you've got - probably more\\". Readers too will need all the wits they've got to solve the mystery in this fine 1942 novel, newly reprinted by the House of Stratus.	2001-08-29

Apparently they're dear to the heart of children and adults everywhere. The end of the twentieth century has seen the Thomas the Tank Engine phenomenon which has put the Wilabert Awdry books from the 1930s and 1940s back on the childrens' book best seller lists. Now, in time for Christmas 2000, comes a reissue of the complete detective fiction works of his contemporary, Freeman Wills Crofts. Crofts' 1932 novel Death On the Way is an engrossing mystery yarn, not for children but for adults who like reading about railways and steam trains. Crofts himself was for thirty years a railways construction engineer. For detective fiction enthusiasts who like a good old-fashioned great train mystery, there is nobody so well qualified or who does it better than Freeman Wills Crofts. In Chapter 2, here's how he describes being in the cab of a steam engine: - \\"The beam of light from the partly opened firebox door, now continuously white from the rapid beat, shone out on the front of the tender and up above it onto the roof of the cab. From these it was reflected back over the faceplate, or end of the boiler, showing up the maze of pipes and handles, gauges and dials, and bringing out unexpected highlights from polished brasswork.\\" Contraband, forgery, swindles - these are usually the crimes being investigated in Crofts' novels. The swindle here involves altering documents, earth work quantities, and the widening of a railway. Crofts has the knack of inventing plausible swindles which can and do bring a measure of success and riches to the perpetrators. Accordingly, uncovering the swindle and detecting the culprits is often and long and laborious task for his sleuth Inspector French. French has a liking for railways timetables. When interviewing a suspect he says, \\"Now I wonder could you put times on to it all? I like things set out in the form of a railway timetable.\\" Crofts plots and plans everything with perfect engineering precision. He even takes usinto the mind of the murderer occasionally, but so subtly and safely that the effect is to turn away rather than increase suspicion. Altogether, a well-constructed murder mystery.	2001-08-28

When subsequently Reeve's house is partly destroyed by fire, Tony is charged with the blackmailer's murder. Among those hoping desperately to prove Tony's innocence is his sister, and she seeks the assistance of Inspector French. In his 1941 \\"curl up by the fire and enjoy a good detective yarn\\" production, Freeman Wills Crofts leads his reader from a presentation of the crime, on to the accusation of the wrong man, through an investigation of all suspects, to the breaking of an apparently cast-iron alibi, and to the final \\"thriller\\" capture. Young Tony is a budding detective fiction writer, and Freeman Wills Crofts throws in along the way a few insights into the craft of which he himself was a master. English publishers, The House of Stratus, have republished this novel in the year 2000 as part of their complete edition of the detective fiction works of Freeman Wills Crofts. The format, the art deco cover art work, and the print and paper quality are uniformly excellent. It seems strange that, in presenting these minor classics from the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, the House of Stratus does not provide a first publication date.	2001-08-27

After twenty years as a successful writer of detective fiction, Irish ex-railway engineer Freeman Wills Crofts was keen to experiment with new presentations and modifications to the classic formulas. The result may be seen in his 1941 book, \\"James Tarrant, Adventurer\\". Detection, or even the sniff of a murder, is postponed during the first eleven chapters. Instead we read of the ingenious scheme of a disgruntled chemist shop worker to produce and market a medicine that can be \\"almost-legally\\" offered to the public as a substitute for the well-known, nationally advertised one. We then accompany Crofts' regular detective, Scotland Yard Chief Inspector French, through seven chapters of detection, alibi checking and interviews, following the book's only murder. We finally read four or five chapters devoted to the trial of two murder suspects. This may seem an obvious structure in the telling of a story, but the usual classic \\"Who done it\\" usually offers more variety, flexibility and mystery. Crofts' is always a good storyteller, he always succeeds with his sleuth, Inspector French, and he is as good as anyone at courtroom scenes. Another strength is his ability to invent an unusual fraud, a corporate swindle, or an \\"almost legal\\" scheme such as the one depicted here. Plotting and planning in this book, as always, is excellent, justifying Raymond Chandler's comment that Freeman Wills Crofts was \\"the soundest builder of them all\\".	2001-08-25

Thanks to the English publishers, the House of Stratus, it is possible in 2001 to purchase the complete detective fiction works of Freeman Wills Crofts.  I have already received twelve of the thirty-five volumes in the uniform series.  After years of browsing in antiquarian books shops and searching in their catalogues, it is wonderful to have and to read some of these long out of print detective yarns.<br />This one, \\"The Ponson Case\\" was the author's second production, and dates from 1921.  When you see that Chapter One is entitled \\"Mystery at Luce Manor\\" you expect that this will be a classic whodunit featuring the butler, the boathouse and the brandy before bedtime, and that the reading experience will be much like playing the board game \\"Cleudo\\".  Well, there is plenty of the traditional whodunit fun to enjoy here.  Mysteries are solved and dissolved, alibis are offered and tested, timetables are constructed and checked.  The investigation is co-ordinated by a Scotland Yard detective, Inspector Tanner, although some amateur sleuthing also occurs.  <br />Crofts' mastery of plot construction is evident here, the traditional narrative formulas receive a fresh handling, there are unexpected twists aplenty, and plodding detection work is made fascinating.  <br />You will enjoy opening \\"The Ponson Case\\" and be sorry when it is closed.	2001-08-23

This is one of Freeman Wills Crofts' most interesting and frequently reprinted books.  The initial puzzling discoveries are made by an ordinary young Englishman in the first chapter. He is holidaying in France.  His amateur investigations suggest that a trade in pit props across the English Channel is a cover for a smuggling racket.  His investigations are later linked with a Scotland Yard murder investigation.  The Scotland Yard man is Inspector Willis of the Criminal Investigation Department.  The author describes him as \\"plodding and tenacious to an extraordinary degree\\".  In his next book, Freeman Wills Crofts developed this character, re-named him Joseph French, and retained him in all his subsequent books.<br />Things which the author does very well are evident in this 1923 book.  There are several long surveillance sequences.  Seymour Merriman, the ordinary young Englishman, and his friend Claud Hilliard, take turns in secreting themselves in a barrel on a wharf in order to observe the unloading of a ship's cargo.  Their amateur detecting, and Scotland Yard's better resourced investigating, provide absorbing reading throughout this relatively long yarn.  There is also a love interest, and this is not something the author does well.  A certain Miss Coburn, much like the heroine of a Victorian melodrama, reiterates from time to time \\"it can never be\\" whenever the ordinary young Englishman suggests marriage to her.<br />Over all is the warm nostalgic glow that emanates from many of the 1920s examples of the \\"Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\", a glow that is brightly reflected in this splendid reprint from The House of Stratus.	2001-08-22

Trudging along a railway line, on his way home after completing an all-night shift, a railway signalman discovers a man's body on the track inside a tunnel. It is clear that the man has been struck by a passing rain and that the injuries are terrible. Crofts provides this opening to his 1923 crime novel, and thereafter sets out his detection puzzle with his usual expertise and craftsmanship. This is one of his earlier books. To his talents for story telling, time tabling, and depicting courtroom procedure, he displays here his skill at describing settings and geographic locations. The second half of this novel is set in Scotland. To read the descriptions of Ballachulish, Crianlarich, and the lochs thereabouts is to want to visit the locations, to want to traverse the journeys, and to measure the distances as told here. Crofts sets the first half of the book in South Africa, initiating a pattern followed by several other &quot;golden age of detective fiction&quot; writers of the 1920s and 1930s. The investigation of the initial murder proceeds very rapidly. Croft had not yet created his Inspector French, but the methods of detection are the same. Then, a subsequent crime in Scotland follows the same pattern: the victim is enticed to a meeting at a lonely place by the lure of vital information. Yes, the criminal is the same in each case - but who is he? You, like the investigating officer, will be in for a surprise!	2001-08-18

His entrance into the Golden Age of Detective Fiction occurred in 1920, concurrently with Agatha Christie's.  Much as they admired each other's work, they provided different types of mystery fiction.  Don't expect the cosy country house murder, the family feuds, the focus on personal relationships in \\"Golden Ashes\\".  Expect instead an engineer's approach to creating and solving mysteries.  The mystery to be solved is not usually the identity of a murderer.  The mystery instead might be a clever fraud, an ingenious smuggling racket, or a blackmail scheme.  In \\"Golden Ashes\\" an insurance fraud is suspected and investigated.  Crofts' sleuth is a Scotland Yard man, Inspector French.  For most of the book we follow French with his dogged, \\"leave no stone unturned\\" investigation.  Every possible witness is questioned.  In the 1940s, there were of course plenty of servants, railway staff, and lift operators to swell the ranks of possible witnesses.  Every suspect is watched.  Every route is measured.  Every alibi is timed and tested.  Strangely enough, this apparently boring and unimaginative approach makes fascinating reading.  Crofts perfected to so-called \\"time-table\\" mystery, and \\"Golden Ashes\\" displays this genre admirably.  Over the years I have read and re-read all Crofts' mysteries.  \\"Golden Ashes\\" is as good as any of them.  If you might enjoy what used to be called \\"a good yarn\\", well crafted and immensely readable, then I recommend it.	2001-08-18

All the women are ticket sellers in cinemas.  When one of them consults French to enlist his aid and is subsequently found dead, floating in the English Channel, by a fisherman, French accelerates his investigation.<br />Bringing all the above checking procedures into play, he is able to pinpoint the spot along the coast where the body was dumped from a stolen boat.  And so the case continues, every element of the unsolved mystery logically considered and explored to the end.<br />Less ambitious and a little shorter than most of Crofts' other detection novels, this one is nevertheless recommended for its ingenuity and readability to all those who like to collect samples from \\"The Golden Age of Detective Fiction\\".	2001-08-17

Robbery, prostitution, paedophilia, suicide, drug offences, assassination, murder, missing persons, ghosts - all these things come to the attention of the regular officers that feature in McBain's books.  The cross-cutting and the editing techniques now so familiar to viewers of TV police procedural programs are here initiated by McBain.<br />As usual, McBain displays unerring skill at presenting scenes and characters vividly and economically.  Especially realistic is the dialogue.<br />Readers who wish to be introduced to an Ed McBain crime novel are recommended to start with this one.  Shorter than most, but tightly-packed, it provides the reader with quick access to the realism, sleaze and sensation that comprise the McBain formula.	2001-08-17

Readers of old-fashioned, can't put it down detective yarns can be grateful to British publishers, The House of Stratus, for republishing in a uniform edition of 35 volumes  the complete detection novels and short stories of Freeman Wills Crofts.  Crofts was one of the supreme masters of plot construction in this genre.  Raymond Chandler praised Crofts' plots, calling him \\"the soundest builder of them all\\".           Crofts began his literary career with his masterpiece \\"The Cask\\" in 1920.  He produced, on average, one book a year during the rest of his life.  \\"Sudden Death\\" was his 1932 production.  If the detective fiction genre can de divided into categories, then this book belongs to the \\"locked room\\" category.  Two deaths occur in locked rooms in the same house.  Each is assumed to be suicide but Inspector French discovers them to be murders.  <br />Ingenious as is the plotting and planning, I must say that (a rare occurrence for me) I was easily able to guess the identity of the murderer long before arriving at the final chapter.  The reading and the guessing was pure pleasure throughout, of course, and I guarantee they will be for you too.	2001-08-17

So thinks one of the characters in Freeman Wills Crofts' 1946 crime novel \\"Death Of a Train\\".  Ironically, the character is about to be the only witness to a brilliantly described death of a train.<br />The crime for Chief Detective Inspector French to investigate in this novel is sabotage.  In July 1942 the British Prime Minister announces to his War Cabinet that he has received the most urgent request for vital supplies of radar valves from the Commander-in-Chief of the North African Campaign and from the O. C. Home Forces.  Existing stocks, however, are sufficient to meet only one of the requests.  It is essential that the enemy should be prevented from knowing how short is the supply of these vital stocks,  which request will be met, and how the stocks will be transported.<br />So is created the Train, whose birth, life, and death are brilliantly depicted in the first half of the novel.  Less impressive is the second half of the book, in which French adopts various detecting methods, inspired by fictional detectives of earlier generations such as Dr Thorndyke and Sherlock Holmes, to identify and apprehend the Train's killers.<br />This is one of Crofts' most ambitious books.  The plotting and planning, as well as the first hand knowledge of steam locomotives, reflect his thirty years as a railway engineer.  The list of characters ranges from the British prime minister to the lady who cleans \\"the moving parts, the mass of rods slung outside the wheels at each side of the framing, the spring links, couplings, axle-boxes and such like\\".<br />There are at least two unconvincing actions in the narrative.  A young female witness too readily agrees to be taken by strangers to observe and identify a suspect.  French does not hesitate to gain the support of a medico by \\"letting him in on the secret\\", when, for all he knows, the medico might be one of the enemy.<br />Quaint, engrossing, perhaps slightly flawed, this is one of Crofts' finest tributes to the romance of steam locomotives.Quaint, engrossing, perhaps slightly flawed, this is one of Crofts' finest tributes to the romance of steam locomotives.	2001-08-02

Crofts provides further satisfaction by allowing French to be promoted to chief-inspector.	2001-07-31

Elizabeth Jane Howard's career as a novelist has been long and distinguished.  Her autobiography is due to be published in 2002.  \\"The Long View\\" is one of her early novels, dating from 1956.<br />The author adopts an unusual construction for her narrative.  It might be called chronology in reverse.  Instead of tracing the development of a relationship between husband and wife over a period of twenty-four years,  Miss Howard begins in the present and reverts, stage by stage, to the time of the first meeting.<br />No novelist known to me is as skilled as Miss Howard at dissecting and displaying the myriad flickerings and quiverings of people's thought and emotions in dialogue with themselves and in interaction with each other.  Admiration of this skill is more likely to command your attention in this book than are the appeals of suspense, plot development and setting.	2001-07-26

Sir Roland Chatterton's country estate borders on the river Thames. Close to the river is \\"the joy of his heart\\", a sun trap bordered on three sides by evergreen shrubs and open on the other to the sun and the river. Here, during fine periods of the summer, he has his chair placed and here her sits surrounded by his books and papers sometimes for his whole day. On one such day, when members of his family and household are summoned to the sun trap by the sound of a gun shot, it appears that he has suicided.  This is the principal mystery around which Freeman Wills Crofts builds his 1949 book \\"Silence For the Murderer\\". Allied to this mystery there is also a clever swindle perpetrated by two of the principal characters. The swindle and the suicide are so ingeniously contrived by Crofts that their discovery and explanation, at the hands of Chief Inspector French, are almost too amazing to be believed. There is also an amazing twist at the end of the book, when it seems that the case is well and truly solved.<br />Nearing the end of his detective fiction career, Crofts has here allowed less space for the dogged detection, timetable checking formula he had used ever since 1920. A love interest component occupies a considerable part of the book. Chief Inspector French's entry is delayed until two third of the way through.	2001-06-30

After twenty years as a successful writer of detective fiction, Irish ex-railway engineer Freeman Wills Crofts was keen to experiment with new presentations and modifications to the classic formulas.  The result may be seen in his 1941 book, \\"Circumstantial Evidence\\".  Detection, or even the sniff of a murder, is postponed during the first eleven chapters.  Instead we read of the ingenious scheme of a disgruntled chemist shop  worker to produce and market a medicine that can be \\"almost-legally\\" offered to the public as a substitute for the well-known, nationally advertised one.  We then accompany Crofts' regular detective, Scotland Yard Chief Inspector French, through seven chapters of detection, alibi checking and interviews, following the book's only murder.  We finally read four or five chapters devoted to the trial of two murder suspects.  This may seem an obvious structure in the telling of a story, but the usual classic \\"Who done it\\" usually offers more variety, flexibility and mystery.<br />Crofts' is always a good story teller, he always succeeds with his sleuth, Inspector French, and he is as good as anyone at court room scenes.  Another strength is his ability to invent an unusual fraud, a corporate swindle, or an \\"almost legal\\" scheme such as the one depicted here.  Plotting and planning in this book, as always, is excellent, justifying Raymond Chandler's comment that Freeman Wills Crofts was \\"the soundest builder of them all\\".	2001-06-06

Almost every formula, idea, and trick that Agatha Christie used in her detective fiction works proved to be entirely successful and won her an enormous reading public. Making use of nursery rhymes was one such formula. Nursery rhymes can reawaken the sense of wonder, mystery and enchantment in any reader. They also can carry symbolic levels of meaning, and some are allegories.<br />In this her 1953 offering she makes use of the nursery rhyme &quot;Sing A Song Of Sixpence&quot;. Appropriately it is one of her Miss Marple books. Although her elderly spinster sleuth has little to do here, and is late making her appearance, it is she who perceives and urges the significance of the nursery rhyme. &quot;Don't you see, it makes a pattern to all this.&quot;<br />The murders occur in the disfunctional family of Rex Fortescue, a financier, and the action occurs in his London office and in the family home, Yew Tree Lodge. The opening chapters are wonderfully engaging. Agatha Christie, when she took the trouble, could sketch characters vividly. Amongst all of them in this book, there are not more than a handful of suspects. To compensate, Mrs Christie throws in buckets full of red herrings.<br />You'll enjoy the puzzle, and having innumerable theories suggested and dismissed. The solution, when it comes, however, is no more plausible than is the likelihood of a blackbird pecking off a maid's nose.<br />If you can obtain the unabridged reading of the book by Rosemary Leach, your enjoyment will be enhanced. Rosemary Leach is unusually skilled at &quot;doing&quot; the voices of a large cast of characters, male and female.	2001-05-30

Detective fiction writers Agatha Christie and Freeman Wills Crofts both had popular successes in the mid-1920s.  Crofts introduced his sleuth, Inspector Joseph French of Scotland Yard in this 1925 book.  Already in his 50s (he refers to his eldest child having been killed in World War 1), French proved to be so popular that Crofts included him in all his detective fiction for a further thirty years.<br />The book's title probably continues to attract first time readers to Crofts' work.  Readers who like to sample books from the &quot;Golden Age of British Detective Fiction (1920-1940) will find strengths and weaknesses.  The book displays Crofts' &quot;puzzle solving&quot; formula admirably.  A problem occurs, a theory is formulted, testing follows, each discovery likely to form a &quot;spring board&quot; to further discovery.  If a dead-end is encountered, another theory is formulated, etc.  Crofts also keeps us in company with  Inspector French throughout the whole book.<br />If these are some of the strengths, then a few weaknesses must be acknowledged.  Expect old-fashioned crimes and old-fashioned criminals.  The crime and murder here, popular in detective fiction of the time, involved the theft of diamonds.  One of the criminal's skills, also popular at the time,  was the devising and use of a code.  Both of these elements will appear dated and quaint to C21st readers.<br />So is it Inspector French's greatest case?  Reading the thirty or so other books in which he features will give you the answer, together with many hours of enjoyment.	2001-05-05

Readers of old-fashioned, can't put it down detective yarns can be grateful to British publishers, The House of Stratus, for republishing in a uniform edition of 35 volumes  the complete detection novels and short stories of Freeman Wills Crofts.  Crofts was one of the supreme masters of plot construction in this genre.  Raymond Chandler praised Crofts' plots, calling him &quot;the soundest builder of them all&quot;.  Crofts began his literary career with his masterpiece &quot;The Cask&quot; in 1920.  He produced, on average, one book a year during the rest of his life.  &quot;Sudden Death&quot; was his 1932 production.  If the detective fiction genre can de divided into categories, then this book belongs to the &quot;locked room&quot; category.  Two deaths occur in locked rooms in the same house.  Each is assumed to be suicide but Inspector French discovers them to be murders.<br />Ingenious as is the plotting and planning, I must say that (a rare occurrence for me) I was easily able to guess the identity of the murderer long before arriving at the final chapter.

So thinks one of the characters in Freeman Wills Crofts' 1946 crime novel &quot;Death Of a Train&quot;.  Ironically, the character is about to be the only witness to a brilliantly described death of a train.<br />The crime for Detective Chief Inspector French to investigate in this novel is sabotage.  In July 1942 the British Prime Minister announces to his War Cabinet that he has received the most urgent request for vital supplies of radar valves from the Commander-in-Chief of the North African Campaign and from the O. C. Home Forces.  Existing stocks, however, are sufficient to meet only one of the requests.  It is essential that the enemy should be prevented from knowing how short is the supply of these vital stocks,  which request will be met, and how the stocks will be transported.<br />So is created the Train, whose birth, life, and death are brilliantly depicted in the first half of the novel.  Less impressive is the second half of the book, in which French adopts various detecting methods, inspired by fictional detectives of earlier generations such as Dr Thorndyke and Sherlock Holmes, to identify and apprehend the Train's killers.<br />This is one of Crofts' most ambitious books.  The plotting and planning, as well as the first hand knowledge of steam locomotives, reflect his thirty years as a railway engineer.  The list of characters ranges from the British prime minister to the lady who cleans &quot;the moving parts, the mass of rods slung outside the wheels at each side of the framing, the spring links, couplings, axle-boxes and such like&quot;.<br />There are at least two unconvincing actions in the narrative.  A young female witness too readily agrees to be taken by strangers to observe and identify a suspect.  French does not hesitate to gain the support of a medico by &quot;letting him in on the secret&quot;, when, for all he knows, the medico might be one of the enemy.<br />Quaint, engrossing, perhaps slightly flawed, this is one of Crofts' finest tributes to the romance of steam locomotives.edico might be one of the enemy.  <br />Quaint, engrossing, perhaps slightly flawed, this is one of Crofts' finest tributes to the romance of steam locomotives.	2001-01-01

Much of the enjoyment in constructing and experimenting provided by these childhood pastimes may be found by adult readers of his books, then and now.<br />This one is in the Chemistry set category.  At the heart of the mystery is a process for desalinating sea water.  This one is also an attempt by Crofts to try his hand at the &quot;English Country House&quot; murder mystery.  All the stock characters are there - the unpopular host, the troubled wife and her secret lover, the nephew, the secretary, the laboratory worker, the butler, an aggrieved sacked employee,  the chauffeur, the gardener, and a full staff of female domestics.

This is one of Freeman Wills Crofts' most interesting and frequently reprinted books.  The initial puzzling discoveries are made by an ordinary young Englishman in the first chapter. He is holidaying in France.  His amateur investigations suggest that a trade in pit props across the English Channel is a cover for a smuggling racket.  His investigations are later linked with a Scotland Yard murder investigation.  The Scotland Yard man is Inspector Willis of the Criminal Investigation Department.  The author describes him as &quot;plodding and tenacious to an extraordinary degree&quot;.  In his next book, Freeman Wills Crofts developed this character, re-named him Joseph French, and retained him in all his subsequent books.<br />Things which the author does very well are evident in this 1923 book.  There are several long surveillance sequences.  Seymour Merriman, the ordinary young Englishman, and his friend Claud Hilliard, take turns in secreting themselves in a barrel on a wharf in order to observe the unloading of a ship's cargo.  Their amateur detecting, and Scotland Yard's better resourced investigating, provide absorbing reading throughout this relatively long yarn.  There is also a love interest, and this is not something the author does well.  A certain Miss Coburn, much like the heroine of a Victorian melodrama, reiterates from time to time &quot;it can never be&quot; whenever the ordinary young Englishman suggests marriage to her.<br />Over all is the warm nostalgic glow that emanates from many of the 1920s examples of the &quot;Golden Age of Detective Fiction&quot;.	2000-12-07

His entrance into the Golden Age of Detective Fiction occurred in 1920, concurrently with Agatha Christie's.  Much as they admired each other's work, they provided  different types of mystery fiction.  Don't expect the cosy country house  murder, the family feuds, the focus on personal relationships in  &quot;Golden Ashes&quot;.  Expect instead an engineer's approach to  creating and solving mysteries.  The mystery to be solved is not usually  the identity of a murderer.  The mystery instead might be a clever fraud,  an ingenious smuggling racket, or a blackmail scheme.  In &quot;Golden  Ashes&quot; an insurance fraud is suspected and investigated.  Crofts'  sleuth is a Scotland Yard man, Inspector French.  For most of the book we  follow French with his dogged, &quot;leave no stone unturned&quot;  investigation.  Every possible witness is questioned.  In the 1940s, there  were of course plenty of servants, railway staff, and lift operators to  swell the ranks of possible witnesses.  Every suspect is watched.  Every  route is measured.  Every alibi is timed and tested.  Strangely enough,  this apparently boring and unimaginative approach makes fascinating  reading.  Crofts perfected to so-called &quot;time-table&quot; mystery, and  &quot;Golden Ashes&quot; displays this genre admirably.  Over the  years I have read and re-read all Crofts' mysteries.  &quot;Golden  Ashes&quot; is as good as any of them.
