Even if you have never seen polymer clay, this book, by polymer artisan and author Emma Ralph, will intrigue and inspire you.<br />I bought this book because I design jewelry using polymer clay beads made by other people, and I wanted to read more about it.<br />Jewelry--beads, pendants, and earrings--is not the only way you can use polymer clay, however. This stunningly photographed book proves that, with a variety of projects devised by talented and well known artisan Emma Ralph for readers from the beginner group on up to the more experienced.<br />She is very clear in her instructions and leaves absolutely nothing out--from safety, to amount of clay you will need, to what to do with scraps left over.<br />When you make a project with this book by your side you are in confident and stylish hands.<br />Polymer clay is a form of plastic. It is an exceptionally flexible medium which can be baked in a regular oven to a degree of hardness which enables you to make an incredible array of items.<br />This book has wonderful explanations and is greatly appealing to look at. You will WANT to make things with polymer -- get ready to explore something and have a great time doing it!<br />Even if you have used polymer clay before, you will learn new techniques and gain experience from this book. There are a number of skill levels to the projects, and the author has marked some of them to note this. I liked that. There are also some really interesting variations explored in some of the projects as well. For example, when you have leftover clay after making one of the projects which involves covering an egg with polymer, you can use it to make pendants. This is illustrated with photographs.<br />I liked the &quot;artist's tips&quot;--little quick notes throughout the projects--to ease things along, or add something special to what you are working on.<br />I also liked the remarkable variety of things to make. You like mobiles? There is a mobile in here. You like personalized greeting cards? Believe it or not, you can make a card with polymer!

I tried to figure out why the author, who has children of his own, was so deficient in portraying feelings-- this, for me would be a critical area to work on if I were to rewrite this otherwise satisfying, fastpaced suspense novel. After all, the plot centers around a child who suffers a terrible climbing injury and his father's desperate attempts to \\"get to him\\", despite power hungry surgeons and mad scientists. The only conclusion I could come to was that either the situation was too unbearable for the author to countenance, or he was a cold fish.<br />Either way, have fun reading it, and don't worry--you won't be too upset when you do. And if you hate sci-fi, read it anyway. Call it futuristic, instead. I did.<br />The father, a photographer, is given a love interest in the form of an energetic helpmate. Conveniently, she is a neurosurgon at the hospital where his child is being treated, and she is able to bend the rules and get Dad around the tough guy nurses. By the time the two of them fall in love, it's time for a fun climax, of the totally-unbelievable-but-who-cares type that doesn't involve sex--just good old computers and cyberfantasy. I think the author of this book knows his stuff--and by the way, I think HIS only \\"fatal flaw\\" may be the one he brags about when describing the female neurosurgeon's family origin. She is from Greenland. Her mother always told her: \\"We have ice waterin our veins\\". Somebody get out the microwave for 45 seconds or so and this book would have been cooked just right. Read it anyway. You'll like it.	2002-09-10

It is an unusual beginning to read, and I found it interesting and curious.  Like Susie, I had little emotion at the beginning of her final moments on earth, because the way the novel expressed this didn't build up the arc of intensity in that manner.  It was only later, when I began to learn more, that I felt more.<br />I do not like books which are sensationalistic, and this is not like that. I do not like books which are overly sentimental even more, and this is not like that, either.  This is a novel of turns not taken, potentential not realized yet fulfilled anyway: through others...through others who continue to live.<br />It really is a fine novel.<br />I liked the slow fulfillment of the characters qualities--the humanity here is so palpable.  Small incidents are beautifully etched because of this.  I believe that the murdered girl, Susie, could be likened to a spokesperson for a \\"Small Town\\" type scenario.  Becuase she can see everything from her heaven, and can grasp certain things which people are feeling, the beauty that is transient life is expressed in an odd, yet fascinating and unique way.  Worth reading.  thanks, jean	2002-08-06

I had read in a review that &quot;parents of disabled children&quot; might just have a different reaction to the book than, say, a &quot;regular&quot; reader might.<br />But none of us are let off the hook that easily. Not me and not you.<br />The author, Julie Salomon, has constructed a book so complex in its levels, so nonjudgemental in its reporting, and so well crafted in its writing, I was just...stunned, at the end.  I was stunned to have finished a book that I couldn't just toss into the category of: &quot;Oh, she'll never understand what a monster that man was&quot;, or &quot;Oh! mental illness is the explanation...let us have compassion&quot; or &quot; Oh! She wants me to think THIS way, or THAT way...&quot;<br />There is no pat answer provided by this book to this awful set of murders committed by this human being who destroyed his family and his own life, by so doing. It doesn't matter that he is &quot;redeemed&quot; by his devoted second wife, and their  child. For it is not, in fact redemption.  It is merely existence until his own death that we see unfold before us. This is a very sad book, written very well, absolutely NOT a true crime story, but rather a story of human frailty and the manner in which we deal with it.<br />You want to hate this man for killing his family, but in the end...if you do...you lose a piece of you own soul, in the sense that you have passed judgement where there is no judgement required to be passed. It has been meted out already, his suffering quite clear.	2001-07-03

Are you interested in wasting your time reading novels that don't have a shred of honesty in any single passage? If so,THE LAST TIME THEY MET, by Anita Shreve, is tailor-made for you.<br />I only finished reading it because it made me so angry that the author was using fifteen grandiose pompous words to say one thing in every overweighted, phoney paragraph that I felt compelled to finish it, and then, when I was done, come on and WARN you. I'm telling you, I was shocked--that's right, SHOCKED, that this book got the good press that it did. I'm not kidding. I love good books and this is not a good book. This is a book that I would call, at best, slick.<br />Granted, I did not read Shreve's other novels first, but who is to say that that means a book shouldn't stand on its own? A BOOK SHOULD ALWAYS STAND ON ITS OWN.  So I don't buy the excuse that one of Shreve's other books had the same characters, and it would change my opinion of this novel if I had read that one first. There is never any excuse for dishonest writing.<br />All my life I have respected and honored good writing. This book is a calculated piece of junk that possesses no human feeling. Anyone who has ever had a moment of true sadness, or has ever felt real love, will know immediately, that, like a &quot;chick flick&quot;, this book is a mere form of escapism, and an insult to any reader who cares about quality writing, true passion and real love. There. I have said my piece about the betrayal that is this book.	2001-06-27

Especially because I was reviewing it while making animals out of balloons, playing the banjo, and writing a screenplay for my next film....while hanging upside down.<br />Yes, folks, this is not an easy book to review.<br />And it's not easy humor to &quot;get&quot; all the time.<br />If you are dumb, don't buy this book. Oops, sorry.<br />If you are pretentious, consider buying this book, but don't read it.  Whoops.<br />If you like to pass out laughing at certain things and you are willing to let other things go that are not totally &quot;perfect&quot; for your tastes in humor, BUY THIS BOOK.<br />Steve Martin has an amazing, remarkable BRAIN and he is trying many things with these pieces in this book. It is not meant to be a cohesive whole, written in a single style. Do not expect to love all of it.<br />But the parts that get you..are really really worth it.<br />Good Father's Day book.<br />I love Steve Martin.  And this little book is diverse, far ranging, and worth typing upside down for.	2001-05-30

This Award Winning Book Makes it Easier	I cannot get over the fact that one woman took it upon herself to gather together in this small, yet totally thorough guide, all the treatments concerning autism available to us here in the United States. This is a remarkable feat.<br />This Guide is an invaluable asset and you are behooved to own it, if you have an autistic child or adult in your life. It should be in the library of every single person who has any sort of connection to autism, be it professional, or familial. It will show you all the options we can turn to in the most easily understandable manner.  It is not a judgemental tract. That is not the intention.  It is a source of information and explanations.<br />So do not expect the author to tell you what to do with your child or relative with autism. DO expect the author to present you with the vast array of treatments available in a concise, clear manner.<br />I know, as a mother of two autistic children, that out there, this determined woman did all the legwork for all of us, did it well, updated it just this year, and I am grateful.  You can throw this in your pocketbook for school meetings, you can read it when your child has first been diagnosed and you know nothing, or you can use it to look up any sort of therapy you might have heard a bit about from someone in passing.  It's all in here.  AMAZING, EXTRAORDINARY BOOK. A MUST HAVE!!! Thank you, Elizabeth Gerlach.	2000-12-09

You pick this book up, in the right frame of mind, and settle down for a tale...like the Tale of Sleepy Hollow...or the Turn of the Screw, or The Haunting of Hill House.<br />There is an eerie mood to this book but not so much that you cannot empathathize with the narrator, who, when we meet her, is so old she knows that if she doesn't tell her story now, it will be lost forever.<br />Most of the time, in the book, she is her young, wild self, madly in love with the local bad boy, back in the twenties, in a difficult summer in her life. The  starkly depicted yet beautiful coast of Maine is the perfect setting for their affair of the heart and soul.  One second you are becalmed, one second you are crashed against the rocks.<br />Years earlier, another affair began and ended in murder and tragedy.  These two love stories are entwined.  Our present narrator, Hannah, learns all she can of the awful town tragedy that is still recalled by some, but was never solved to anyone's satisfaction.<br />Yes, I got the chills when the ghost appeared; perhaps you need to want to believe?  For fun? To think that there may be something more?  Who knows?  I also felt the passion and the happiness that Hannah had with her &quot;bad boy&quot;, Conary. Descriptions of the &quot;clamming day&quot; and the day they took the Packard were full of depth.<br />Were there things lacking in this novel, as so many reviewers have felt? I really liked it, so I don't think so. You read into it what you want to read. The ending must be left up in the air, for the reader to come to conclusions by thinking backwards, the way the book moves backwards, through time...	2000-09-30

This seemed like one of the best.  When I received it, I was really glad I chose it.<br />The author is English, I believe, so keep that in mind...some of her phrasing is slightly different.  Also, some of her advice goes against other books I have read, in certain small aspects.  For example, her dogs sleep on her bed. Most dog books recommend getting your puppy used to a crate in a very specific manner, and it is probably safer to have them sleep there from the start.  What if you need to leave? Wher will you put a new puppy comfortably for an hour or two if it doesn't have a safe little den already?<br />Also, her dogs eat table food.  This is incredibly complicated to do properly. She has bred Standards for YEARS.  You can't just give a dog scraps.  She has an elaborate menu but--trust me on this--I don't feed my own FAMILY this rigidly.  Good, high quality dog food is available to all of us.  Skip the table food.<br />Other than that, this is the coolest book! It had great facts, tips on trains, grooming and showing, lists of breeders, etc. I read it cover to cover!  When I was done, I realized my new family pet was probaby better than all of us, with an older lineage, handsomer in musculature, and maybe even more intelligent. All at only ten weeks old. So what. I am  proud to owned by a poodle!	2000-09-30

As a mother, I almost could not buy this  book...the prospect of losing a child is so awful, I could not imagine  being able to read it.  However, the reviews were really good, and it had  the addition of a possibility --improbably,but I read it in some review  somewhere-- of some good sex scenes, so I thought I'd give it a  try.<br />Surprise, surprise. Ms. Zeidner handles this first person narrative,  told by Claire Newbold, sucessful travelling saleswoman of medical  supplies, wife of Ken Newbold, cardiothoracic surgeon, former mother of  Evan, now dead for three years, with extremely deft perception, humor, and  compassion.  Nobody who makes an appearance in the book is let off the  hook, not Zach, Claire's young lover,she picks up while swimming laps in  the pool at the Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia, not his mother...not  his (oh no!  oh YES! ) father, and especially not Claire... her pain and  semi-breakdown/alienation remind me of another lost soul's: Holden  Caulfield. Her intelligence and the extreme oddness of her behavior  counterpoint each other until you are gathered so effortlessly into her  psyche that her actions make sense, when they shouldn't--and even when SHE  herself is pointing that out to you.<br /> Very strikingly written book,  charming at times, intense at times, sexy at times, sad at times (yes, and  at the end, I cried--but not from sadness...), very different and worth  your time.	2000-07-30

About a hundred years ago, before Margolis was &quot;trainer to the stars&quot; out in CA, I saw him on the Phil Donahue show on tv, as I raced around my NYC apartment hopelessly attempting to keep up with my  destructive, hyperactive, insane puppy that we had adopted from the  A.S.P.C.A.<br />In desperation, I called him and he came over and did the  exact evaluation that he uses in this book to decide which personality type  of dog I had. ( arrrghhhhh! ...I had grown up with wonderful, sweet  tempered, placid dogs  but this puppy was an &quot;experience&quot; I hope  I never repeat--she was the most neurotic creature since Woody  Allen! ).<br />For a small (ha, ha, ha) fee, a trainer was sent over to teach  me to control my dog. Thank heavens.  Obedience training is a must for any  dog, as is stressed in this book.  The family/puppy bond does come first,  however, as is also stressed in this book.<br />I am about to get a new dog  for the first time in years...for my family to love and enjoy.  I was happy  to be able to purchase this book and know that I will be able to understand  the philosophy behind having a puppy join the family, and how to properly  train our new member.  --Because, even though it's been years,  when  Margolis trains you to properly train your dog, you don't  forget.<br />woof,<br />Jean	2000-07-19

As a former deb, I can tell you the New York scene, from that point of view at least, was accurate.  As for the plot...it has shades of &quot;Sabrina&quot; in my opinion. I can see this as the movie it  has apparently already been optioned for very clearly. I hope they manage  to keep the magic that makes it so charming.<br />Take two people from  opposite sides of the tracks, who have nothing in common except their  integrity and passion for their own special causes in life...  Throw in a  former Ivy league football player who has no scruples and loves playing  dirty to get what he wants...  Add a fairy godmother or two (one a  professor, one a carriage driver in Central Park)---and what have you got?  This sweet story of Cornelia, a debutante who is terribly misunderstood,  and her hero, Kevin, the doorman/artist.<br />The only reason I can't give it  five stars is that it is extremely slight. I wanted a bit more bang for my  romance buck ( I won't go into this further, nope), but of course, because  the author is an Ivy League WASP, what do you expect? He is much more  comfortable describing scenes of New York life than feelings. The only  thing that actually brought tears to my eyes was right at the end, when he  mentions his own wife--the love of his life.  You call tell from the way he  writes about her, he has the real deal there.<br />This amiable escapist  novel is worth your time if you like to fall into love with love, in book  form.  In a ladylike manner, of course.!	2000-06-23

I remember being stunned by the beauty of the writing in  earlier books by Sue Miller.  She hits her peak right at the start of this one, unfortunately.  The first scene is beautiful, and...if you look closely,  highly reminiscent of the final scene in one of her other, better books,  FAMILY PICTURES. Both give the reader a sense of suspended time that is  exquistely crafted. As this book was written much later, I consider it  derivative to have tried to recreate the feeling I got from FAMILY  PICTURES.<br />I did enjoy the &quot;trip&quot; back to the Boston of the  60's-70's, but the characters in Jo's commune- type house were poorly  delineated. At times I was confused by the point of the whole thing. The  weakly descibed men vis a vis the vibrant &quot;life force&quot; of the  other woman, Dana, in the house--what was Miller's intention here?  I  needed way more heat generated and less descriptions of meals prepared  (this shopping and preparing of food is a device she uses throughout the  book I found exhausting.  I never want to eat or cook another Holiday meal  again!).<br /> In the second half of the book, after the narrator's two worlds  of past and present collide and intermingle, I didn't believe many of the  scenes at a gut level. I didn't &quot;grasp&quot; why her husband put up  with her, and I didn't like her children. And I didn't much like her,  either. It's hard to go with a book one hundred percent when you aren't  crazy about the person you are reading about.<br />I am a lover of Sue  Miller's books, but this one did not move me. If you want to see how well  this woman can write, try one of her earlier works.<br />best wishes,<br />Jean	2000-06-13

I do not think that Crichton expects us to attend to the concept of  &quot;quantum physics&quot; and time travel other than as devices with  which to spark off another of his exciting, nearly plausible tales. Just as  he did with JURASSIC PARK, he takes a believable scientific possiblity and  then weaves in a flagrantly exotic tale, for fun. I think he is a master at  doing this, and I loved this book. It is set initially in the present and  flashes back and forth classily to the 1300's...with a few double crosses  thrown in. You do learn about the earlier time, with Crichton's apparently  effortless store of information* bolstering his plot effectively.  It's not  really about real people, or real feelings, or values...it's just pure  entertainment on a more elegant than usual level.  I would read this at the  beach and hold my head up high. !<br />best, Jean<br />*it's not really  effortless--get a load of the bibliography at the end!	2000-06-01

She has such finesse as she writes, and she writes in such a unique style, it is hard to  put one of her books down for a second. This author loves writing, and it  shows.  You will love the results. I do not think there is another living  writer who is able to entwine such magic and realism into a story the way  she does, all the time focusing on daily life and never losing sight of the  mysteries that cause us to act in the ways that we do, sometimes for good  reasons, sometimes for bad reasons.<br />When there is a double ragged ring  around the moon, when the smell of lilacs is strong and it is well past the  time they should have finished blooming...when you have a family whose odd  heritage goes back hundreds of years and they draw people to them  unexpectedly...there you will find Alice Hoffman, weaving happy endings out  of strange happenings, and lovely images out of eerie events. Don't ever  try to outthink her.  Part of the fun is just enjoying the way she pulls it  all together in the end. Truly special.	2000-05-25

I have always wondered about this.<br />According to this novel, there is no simple answer. At one point, toward the end of this wrenching journey of a book, Robert, the son of  Fran, the abused narrator, has to draw a family tree for a school project,  using his new name and his new lineage way back to his great grandparents.  It made me wonder if abuse also stretches back in the same entwined way,  complicated, not easy to explain.<br />Fran was willing to lead a double life  for years as the husband of an abusive cop, but what finally makes her  leave is her son.  She can see that he is beginning to accept and also live  the lie that she is so used to. Although his father does not abuse him, she  senses that Robert will die inside if she doesn't spirit him away and begin  an anonymous new life in a new state with support from a battered women's  agency.  Her new life begins a new set of lies.  She can no longer be  herself, or her husband will find her and kill her and take back their boy.  It is an incredibly arduous task for her to work her way toward a small bit  of peace for herself and her son in her new life.<br />This is an important  aspect of this novel: what she has had to give up and what she gains from  it.  It is not simple, and it does not have a simple, &quot;happy&quot;  ending, but it is honest and real and worth reading. Anna Quindlen writes  like an angel by the way.  Try her if you like good writing.	2000-05-22

I was disappointed by the lack of intensity however.  There was real potential for drawing together a time period ( I remember  the late sixties...anyone who was a young adult at that time was apt to be  strongly affected by the changes we all went through ), counterpointed by  the author's inner period of conflict. Instead I got a series of vignettes  of the life inside of the mental institution that were not as powerful as I  had wished. I felt that the author was not being totally honest with  herself when she wrote this book. It was as if she was still protecting  herself.  Why write a book like this unless you are going to pull out all  the stops?  The other people who were in MacLean with her are barely  fleshed out...we are hardly touched by her own predicament, in  fact.<br />Maybe because I was trapped in an all girl's boarding school at the  same time ( the experience was rather similar--we too looked on all the  changes as helpless observers, esssentially) I wanted more. Or maybe it is  just something in myself that recognized she is still hiding  something.<br />Next time, Susannah, be braver and give us the whole truth.	2000-05-17

I bought this one, not knowing that a movie had been made of it (ok, so I live under a rock), but rather because it was in paperback  and I &quot;needed something&quot; to read.<br />&quot;You&quot; says Ellen  Gulden's father, as he throws her stuff out on the porch after she suggests  he &quot;hire a nurse&quot; to take care of her dying mother, &quot;have a  Harvard education, but you have no heart.&quot;<br />And so starts her journey  back into her family (she quits her job in the big city), back to the  mother she never really identified with. So starts her learning  process--about human nature...not just about books, or concepts. So starts  her learning process about what love is, and what communication between  human beings is. It is not just analyzing some dry tract, or being the  &quot;Star Pupil&quot;. It is far more complicated than that.  And this is  a complicated, super book.<br />With her mother's inevitable death, her  learning process continues and she changes, finally, into a person  &quot;with a heart&quot;.  I cannot express how moved I was by this book.  I was absolutely entranced from page one and read it in three days.  I  sense that many of the people who review in this section ( the book  section) like me, love to analyze things and appreciate beautiful, honest  writing.  Well, guess what?  You get that here, but you also get something  more--a look at yourself, and how you must communicate with your family and  loved ones, in less &quot;removed&quot; ways.  I did, anyway. I am going to  try to see things from a more human perspective, because of this book.  It  is good to judge, and yet sometimes it is better to act from the heart. Oh:  and I will TRY to COOK MORE. Can't swear I'll clean any more than I already  do, but nobody's perfect.  :)<br />best,  Jean	2000-05-08

I usually prefer to choose my own books to read; my taste is eclectic and personal.  I suppose everyone is the same way.<br />If you are open to hearing a tale told in a luxuriantly  long and expertly crafted manner, with visually rich scenes and a taut  undertone of sensuality that pulls you toward the ending, you will probably  like this book.<br />It is as simple, and as complex, as anything that is  nearly perfect. I think of the kimonos and the incredible descriptions that  are given of them when I reflect upon one aspect of this book I found  entrancing.  I enjoyed learning things about the culture and I surrendered  myself to the plot.  Like a flower unfolding and blooming, MEMOIRS OF A  GEISHA is a treasure to enjoy and keep in your memory.	2000-04-21

I checked first with my own doctor to see if in fact this condition really  does exist: he affirmed that it does.  Apparently, I, like so many other  people, am out of date in my knowledge of the existence of early onset  bipolar disorder.<br /><br />As it is critical to your child's well being and future  health to get a proper diagnosis of such a serious condition, this book can  be very helpful.  It contains a list of resources at the end that are worth  their weight in gold alone. Furthermore, there are apparently, according to  the authors, quite a few misdiagnosed children out there who are being  treated with the wrong medications and the sooner they get helped on their  way to the correct ones the more stable their health will remain.  This is  imperative as  this disorder must be treated with medication.<br /><br />This book  also addresses the state of the family as a unit; this is vitally important  as, when raising any child, you must consider the whole family and the  feelings of any one member at any given time.  The stress from having a  bipolar child is extreme.  Suggestions are given that are helpful to  ameliorate this.<br /><br />Always, always, a respect for and an affection for  children comes through in this book.  As the authors guide you through the  confusing maze of  terms like \\"IEP'S\\", \\"IDEA\\",  \\"hypomania\\",and others, you can be certain that it is being put  as clearly as possible.  If you aren't ready for some of it at one point,  it is waiting for you there when you are.<br /><br />There is hope for children  with this disorder and there is an incredible network of parents out there  online who have been where you are, according to the Papoloes.  This is not  a \\"win/lose situation\\".  It is a growing process, for your child  and for you, I learned. There is great comfort to be found in this book as  it unfolds, and a lot of good hard information.  A good job on a complex  subject.this book as  it unfolds, and a lot of good hard information.

That was how ignorant I was--I thought it meant he wasn't autistic!  Six years and one more autistic child later, I still credit this book with  giving me a foothold and a way of grasping how to deal with the educational  interventions that I feel continue to remain most viable for so many  autistic children.  I had nothing but my own gut feelings, one other book  called &quot;Children with Autism&quot;, and this book to guide me in the  beginning stages of what would prove to be the longest, most incredible  journey I have ever made in my life. It's still evolving, and so are we, in  my family.<br />Because of this book, I garnered the strength to look into  educational intervention for my first autistic son in the way of a  &quot;home program&quot;.  I didn't know anything about what a &quot;home  program&quot; entailed until I read this book.  I didn't know that the  optimal time you must devote to a program such as this has been set at 40  hours a week!  I didn't know that there wouldn't be any trained therapists  available--I had to be trained myself, in fact!  I found babysitters, one  high school girl, you name it--at one point I was so desparate I dissolved  in tears and said, &quot;I CAN'T DO THIS! &quot;  But you have to.  YOU  JUST HAVE TO.  And you will, too, because you must.<br />As my supervisor  said to me when she &quot;okayed&quot; us for the program, &quot;Look at it  this way--two years of your life will make such a difference.&quot; And it  did.  Not the sucess story the author had, but at least a sense of control  over things and an awareness of my son's potential.<br />This book gave me  something to hang on to.  I realize now, especially after having a second  autistic son, that not all things go as planned, and not all  &quot;programs&quot; turn out as ideally as Maurice's did.  On the other  hand, you must have hope when you are an autistic parent.  This book gave  me that.  And it gave me an understanding of an invaluable way of teaching  young autistic children that is still the primary way they are taught most  sucessfully (it is called Applied Behavioral Analysis now)that I needed,  just to get started in the right direction.  Buy it and read it.  Use your  brain when you read it and accept the fact that all these kids are  different and you are not this woman.  But be thankful.

Get ready to meet your new one, now that you're older.  This book gave me more pleasure last year when I read it than that much beloved piece of flannel ever did, and I  dragged Nick Hornby's pseudomemoir around with me long after I finished  reading it, in the sense that I tried to FORCE everyone else I knew, even  slightly, to read it.  Why?  Like Rob, the protagonist, I am not exactly  sure about &quot;stuff&quot;. However, at least he is honest, and,  incredibly funny about the mess he is making about his life. In other  words, he is so very, totally, hopelessly HUMAN.<br />I didn't particularly  care about the fact that the author is male and I, the reader, am female.  I think this is not the point of this book.  Rather, this book is about the  struggles we all have, doing our best to face up to our fears, and the  total screw ups we all make just living our lives when we finally take some  sort of a stand about ANYTHING and make a choice.  After all, what could  possibly go wrong?  Ha, ha, ha.<br />Just read the first page and I guarantee  you'll be hooked.  By the time you are finished, you will be touched and  you will want to touch the other people you know by sharing this terrific,  funny, poignant, contempory bestseller with them.<br />Can't wait to see the  movie.  If John Cusack doesn't do right by this, I'll be really surprised.  Even though he is not British, like the author, Nick Hornby, he should be  perfect. He's got the vulnerable yet intelligent maleness that makes you  incapable of not loving High Fidelity's funny, goofy, always trying (well,  kind of) Rob down to a T. Now go rearrange your record collection.<br />best  wishes, Jean	2000-03-29

Autism, the disorder confounding to doctors, educational  professionals and parents alike, deserves to be confronted and thought  about in a variety of ways.  In this book, Ms. Gerlach takes her own  experiences as the mother of an autistic child and expands our  understanding, in a very personal way, of the trials, the confusions, and  the small triumphs that confront a parent of an exceptional child like her  son, Nicky.<br />You will not put this book down until you have read it  cover to cover, I guarantee it. I have lent out this book so many times  over it's absurd! Each time I have been stunned by the profound reactions  of the people I have leant it to, whether they are special ed. teachers,  just friends, professional writers such as Ms Gerlach herself, or parents  of autistic children, like me. It reaches everyone.  Ms. Gerlach's love of  nature, life, and her child shine through on every page.  Get this book.  You will not regret it. It is beautifully honest and you will be moved.  Absolutely one of my favorites in my personal library of books on  autism.<br />best wishes,  Jean	2000-03-18

In order to be diagnosed a manic-depressive (also know as &#34;bi polar&#34;), you have to have also an expisode of the opposite disorder.  In my case, a brief period of depression preceded the mania.<br />When I went  manic, I was brought to a hospital, nearly kicking and screaming. I didn't believe I had this disorder.  If you are a family member of a manic-depressive,  please understand that they are not capable of behaving normally when they are having an episode.<br /> I didn't have to stay away from home too long  because I was caught in a very early stage.  I was lucky. This illness can  devastate people's lives.  Some of us must face it and fight it on a daily  basis.  When I got out of the psychiatric hospital and initally met the  &#34;psychopharmarcologial&#34;* shrink who is my doctor now, he said to  me at my first visit:  &#34;I would like you to read AN UNQUIET MIND, by  Kay Jamison. She is a research scientist who is also a  manic-depressive.&#34;<br />So I did.  And, do you know what?  It helped me  to feel comforted. I no longer felt alone.  I no longer felt quite so  nervous about &#34;trusting my brain&#34;, which had never let me down  before.<br /> I don't feel as guilty for the foolish things I did while manic,  nor I do feel as embarrassed. The shame can be haunting for some people.  This book helps dispel that.  Dr. Jamison is very honest about all the  foolish and self destructive things she did.  Because I read this book, I  understand that I have a neurological disorder that up until recently  was very poorly understood. Because of reading this book, I realize that it  takes stalwart dedication and, in my case, a love of my family to maintain  myself on the road to good health.  Otherwise, sure, I would be tempted to  &#34;fly&#34; again, just as Kay Jamison did.  Her honesty about the  damage she did to herself and to her relationships, and her willingness to  be open about the seductive nature of this disease has helped me remain on  the path to good health.<br />Read this book and dispel some of your  confusion about this not so uncommon, not all that glamorous disorder.  And  then go hug your family, or your s.o.-- or yourself. Hang tough and don't  be afraid.

Maybe, like me, you have considered drugs for your autistic child, but have been understandably reluctant.  Maybe you are overwhelmed by the vast amounts of information bombarding you daily concerning the causes of  autism. Maybe your educational intervention progran hasn't quite worked as  well as you hoped it would.<br />If so, get this book.  It deserves a place  right next to Catherine Maurice's groundbreaking book on intervention  through educational methods, LET ME HEAR YOUR VOICE. Actually, it deserves  a place of honor right on your kitchen table, where you can refer to it  everyday, easily. What Catherine Maurice did for education vis vis autistic  children, this book does for dietary intervention.<br />Karyn Seroussi has  written a practical, clear, acessible book about how your child's diet can  affect his/her whole way of living in our world. She posits that the health  (particularly, a damaged immune system) of your child is one of the major  reasons your child diplays autistic behaviors. She has incorporated her own  child, Miles, and her own family, in a most compassionate and perceptive  way to demonstrate this.  I found that, in and of itself, a comfort.  We  are all in this together, aren't we? We need to help each other.  This book  is all about helping OUR CHILDREN get better.<br />Parents of autistic  children have it hard enough without having to sift through the incredible,  time consuming theories and treatments that come our way daily.  Karyn  covers all of these and makes them understandable. She explains things.  Then she gives you step by step directions to follow to actually improve  the health of your own autistic child  (or in my case, autistic children: I  have two!) This book makes so much sense and is so exciting to read, I  wrote this review as soon as I finished it.  Even if my own children do not  experience the same remarkable recovery that Karyn's son Miles did (she  caught his autism really early), I know, from my other reading, that this  book ultimately makes total sense... and that my sons will be immeasurably  improved.  For that, I am incredibly grateful.  Thank you, Karyn Seroussi.ng, that this  book ultimately makes total sense... and that my sons will be immeasurably  improved.  For that, I am incredibly grateful.  Thank you, Karyn Seroussi.	2000-02-28
