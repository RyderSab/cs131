What makes Ann's book so enjoyable to read is the way she mixes facts with humor.  I can certainly understand why the hard-core left hates her so much!  Deep down, I'm sure her critics dearly wish they had an Ann Coulter on their side instead of relaying instead on Janeane Garafalo and/or the Dixie Chicks.  Ann has a sense of humor so very lacking among her critics.  This book is an excellent read!  By the way, have you noticed how most of the libs who attack Ann for her appearance never talk about Mrs. Clinton or Janet Reno's appearance?  There's a clear and obvious reason for this.  Let's just leave it at that.	2005-08-01

It sheds light on an emerging new political viewpoint that rejects both the family values of the Christian right but/and especially the hypocritical, super-sensitive, self-righteous liberal-left.  It clearly illustrates how conservatives have succeeded over the last eleven years in completely taking over the reigns of the U.S. government (White House, U.S. House, & Senate), all the while ignoring the non-stop ineffective kickings and screamings of the shrill, hysterical, and increasingly impotent Hollywood left.  This was a fun book to read!	2005-08-01

Far from being a hatchet job, I seriously thought it painted a realistic and even occasionally sympathetic picture of her transformation from Goldwater Republican to northeastern liberal in a few short years at Wellesley College, especially the part about that school's flirtation with lesbianism!  Klein's book also sheds light onto the complex relationship between Hillary and former President Bill Clinton, and why it's lasted as long as it has.  A very entertaining and thought-provoking read!	2005-08-01

The majority of artwork in this book is sizzling!  If you enjoy seeing drawings of beautiful women spanking and/or dominating other beautiful women then I highly recommend purchasing this one! <br /> <br />There are a total of 67 illustrations by 14 different artists, most of them featuring women with other women, many involving spankings.  My favorites are those drawn by Ernesto Cumpian, David Pugliese, Marcello Sosa, Alejandro Colucci, Brian LeBlanc, and Pelaez!  Less impressive are the illustrations by Mitch Byrd and J.L. Czerniawski, which are largely girls with guys.  Byrd in particular has some kind of fixation with fat women, which I don't share.  None of his 12 drawings rated very highly with me. <br /> <br />Overall, however, the illustrations in this book are highly erotic and quite good!  Again, I highly recommend this book. <br />  <br /> <br />	2005-04-06

Those familiar with the artwork of \\"The Spirit\\" already know that he possesses a knack for drawing beautiful, sexy women.  But what you might not know is that he also has an erotic flair for drawing women delivering sensual spankings to other women's gorgeous behinds!  The sub/dom element of the relationships between the women giving and the women getting the spankings is quite enjoyable to behold in the Spirit's work.  I would really love to see more!	2005-04-06

I really enjoyed this short novel about a visiting space commander falling in love with a pretty \\"conehead\\" girl, the title being a derogatory term for colonials on planet Gothon who are treated like second class citizens.  The story builds nicely as Commander Slater gets involved deeper and deeper, and in the end discovers Gothon's secret origins while at the same time falling in love with the girl he set out to protect from a simple injustice.  This is a well-told story that I've enjoyed enough to re-read several times, and there aren't all that many books I can say that about.	2005-03-15

I really like the artwork on this series, but even more so the creative eroticism!  This particular volume opens with our two beauties forced to stop for the night due to a blizzard in a remote French village.  There are both cold and miserable and angry at eachother as they accept the hospitality of an aging count and his elderly maid, Marian.  Marian prepares a hot bath for both girls, removing pretty blonde Beth's clothing before bathing her lovely body.  Her intimate caressing and fondling of the much younger girl during the bath doesn't go unnoticed by an angry Liz, who later jealously confronts Beth about allowing the elderly maid to engage in such liberties.  The two girls soon actually begin physically fighting, with Liz overcoming Beth and spanking her gorgeous derriere.  They then make up and Liz then tenderly kisses the same lovely ass she'd been slapping!  It was a wonderfully drawn scene!<br />Later we discover how the elderly count met Marian during the 1940 German invasion of France, but that very well-drawn scene paled in comparison with Liz and Beth's very erotic sub/dom encounter earlier.  Highly recommended.	2004-06-26

If I have a problem with this &quot;Awakening the Virgin&quot; series it's that it's not really about first-time lesbian encounters so much as women recalling a particular encounter they had later in life, or a particular woman.  I guess I had hopes of more lesbian seduction.<br />Having said that, I enjoyed this second volume of the series more than the first because I felt it included a certain kinkiness lacking in the first edition.  These included episodes of sensual bondage and even some light spankings (nothing severe).  I feel the first volume is bland in comparison.	2004-06-07

One of the other reviewers called this book excrement, and I suppose I would agree that a couple of the stories within were bad enough to merit that designation.  But there were also some pearls among the swine!  Another reviewer noted the story about the woman seeking out her former babysitter --- yes, I read that one, too, and it was incredibly arousing!  If all the stories in this book were as hot as that one it would certainly be worthy of five stars!  I found at least two stories that I'd put in that category.<br />One of the problems with these story compilations about \\"tough dykes\\" is that all too often they lose any aspect of fantasy by ridding themselves of all pretty, feminine women, instead making the protagonists all butch and mannish.  This was most obvious in the prison rape story.  It could at least have been erotic in a kinky way, but it ended up just overly-violent and boring.	2002-08-12

Artemis OakGrove and I have different opinions as to what is erotic and what isn't.  Her lesbians are all mostly butchy, and she doesn't seem to care much for pretty feminine women, even as victims.

I don't remember when I first read this book, but I do remember laughing out loud during certain parts (something I rarely ever do!)  If you've seen the movie starring Andy Griffith you have the basic idea as to what it's about, but the book adds a lot of little things which I found immensely amusing.  Needless to say, it's not complimentary to the military, but it's more of an attack on the bureaucracy surrounding the armed forces than it is on anything else.  A very funny book!	2001-04-05

I thought the drawings were wonderful, but the story line here is a bit too brutal.  This poor girl is constantly beaten and sexually assaulted by her jailers who delight in being cruel to her for some unexplained reason.  While this can be erotic at times, eventually it just becomes monotonous.  Probably the sexiest part (in my opinion) was when one of the female guards takes an interest in our pretty prisoner, but then a male guard is quick to interfere before the scene gets even remotely interesting.  Still, the artwork was quite pretty.  I just wish the author showed more imagination.	2000-12-17

I first read this book back in the sixties, after my brother told me about  his teacher reading it in class, and nearly everybody crying at the end.   It really is an emotional ending!  The book itself is very well written,  and Wilson Rawls does an excellent job of drawing the reader into the  story.  It's an excellent story for young people, and you won't regret  taking the time to read it.  But you will also have a tough time holding  back tears at the end.  Trust me on this.	2000-09-13

Goscinny &amp; Uderzo were an excellent TEAM, and with one of them gone, it's noticeable that the Asterix series isn't quite the same.  This wasn't a bad book, but I could tell that the writing has fallen off a notch.   Those who have read several of the earlier books will notice this.  Still,  it's not like I hated this book.

Everyone in the village wants to believe the rosy future predicted for them by the soothsayer, with only Asterix expressing any skepticism.  I really love the artwork in this series, as  well as the attempt at giving the reader a feel for the historical era ---  even though it's as historically accurate of ancient times as the  Flintstones is of the caveman era!

Also, a  few promising girl-girl photos, but too few if you ask me.  Overall, a  really hot book!

I'm a big fan of the Asterix series, but I kind of expected this to be a typic Asterix &quot;comic book&quot;.  Instead, it's a text with illustrations!  Yes, it's a nice story about when they were all kids, but I  like the comic book format!  This is more like your typical children's  book!  I was disappointed with the overall result!  Besides, all through  the series they mention how Obelix fell into a cauldron of magic potion  when he was a baby, and that's how he got his permanent strength.  But this  book implies he was more like a little boy of 6 or 7 years old --- NOT  EXACTLY A BABY!  Anyway, I can't recommend this one!	2000-01-19

Petra is a cute brunette who daydreams all the time about girl-girl  encounters involving herself, entering them faithfully in her diary.  This  (fortunately) proves to be her undoing, as the pretty new girl in class  ends up reading the diary, and she and Petra predictably end up having all  kinds of fun together!  I applaud the author and illustrator for their use  of imagination and creativity, often lacking in lesbian erotica --- as well  as their sense of humor, also much appreciated.  The only thing I found to  be misleading was the use of the words &quot;college school girl&quot; in  the title of this work.  It's clear they added &quot;college&quot; just to  make it all appear legal, as Petra and her friends are quite obviously  still in high school.  But that didn't bother me the least bit, as I found  this story and the accompanying illustrations to be both enjoyable and  highly erotic!	2000-01-05

This particular book was one of my  favorites, as John Carter goes under-cover to defeat the assassins guild in  Zodanga.  The characters are many, and they're a colorful bunch (my  favorite: Rapas the Ulsio, and enjoyably repulsive character who befriends  Carter while at the same time trying unsuccessfully to kill him!)

Before I say anything about Ms. Chang's book I'd like to point out that another excellent account of this Chinese tragedy can be found in Pearl Buck's &quot;Dragon Seed&quot;, written during the Second World War.  And  while Ms. Buck's book is technically fiction, it corresponds very closely  with the incidents described by Ms. Chang in her book!<br />As for my reaction  to &quot;The Rape of Nanking&quot;, it's clear that the behavior exhibited  by Japanese troops in the 1930's is hardly a thing of the past, what with  the &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; still practiced in the world today.  My  own reaction upon finishing Ms. Chang's book was THANK GOD FOR THE U.S.  MILITARY!!!  China was woefully weak both during and preceding World War  II, and it's clear that totalitarian nations cannot (and usually will not)  keep their troops in check during military campaigns in a foreign land ---  and why should they?  Their media isn't going to report it anyway!<br />The  biggest surprise of Ms. Chang's book was how the one diplomat the Japanese  respected was a NAZI --- and he emerges as one of the most notable heroes!

If I ever get into SERIOUS TROUBLE for SERIOUS  MISCONDUCT, yes, I'll certainly want James Carville on my side (and Johnny  Cochran, too!)  But for shaping my political philosophy I'll look  elsewhere, thank you!	1999-06-11

I liked the first book in the Nancy Clue series, because it parodied Nancy Drew AND had its sexy scenes, although even those were a bit overly tame.  But this follow-up novel is so much duller, with NO erotica at all!   Perhaps the author thinks by adding feminist psycho-babble she's produced a  better book, but who reads these things for political awakening?  Not me!!!	1999-06-08

How can you miss with a book about lesbian vampires?!!!  This should EASILY have been both scary and intensely erotic --- but it was NEITHER!!!  Problem #1: Too many P.C. authors, trying to make their lesbian vampires  champions of the political plight of lesbian women --- BORING!!!  Problem  #2:  Very poor mixing of terror and sensuality, which like terror and humor  can very often mix together very well!  Problem #3: Isn't the whole vampire  thing usually portrayed as an older evil guy rapaciously pursuing innocent,  virginal young women?  So what's so hard about replacing the older guy with  a beautiful slightly older woman, having her seducing pretty young women  with or without their consent?  No, this book was a failure because Ms.  Kesey tried to go the politically correct route, and the result is a  disappointing, very un-erotic collection of so-so stories.	1999-06-08

I liked the first couple of chapters of this book, as the main protagonist discovers her attraction to her pretty schoolmates, and they begin experimenting with girl-girl sex and spanking eachother.  But the eroticism  never fully develops, and instead the author just keeps adding more and  more girls to the mix.  In the end, I'm inclined to say I just lost  interest.  Eroticism requires imagination, and this book simply ran out.	1999-06-08
US	52624155	RY1FCVCWG8BKM	0064471098	184061428	The Silver Chair	Books	5	12	15	N	N	One of my favorite books in the Narnia series!!!	One of the great things about the Narnia series is how each individual book stands alone!  I mean, while it may be necessary to read them in order to better understand what's going on, each book has a certain charm unique  in itself.  And while I may like ALL of the volumes, I believe the BEST  books are those in the middle, particularly &quot;The Horse and his  Boy&quot;, &quot;The Magician's Nephew&quot;, and &quot;THE SILVER  CHAIR&quot;.  These are the books in which C.S. Lewis really shines!<br />In  this particular volume involving cousin Eustace and his classmate Jill  Pole, Lewis hits hard at the British school system (I dread to think how  he'd view America's public school system today!)  The bullying that Eustace  &amp; Jill face is what launches their adventure into Narnia, and what an  exciting adventure it turns out to be!  Puddleglum is an excellently  crafted character who accompanies them on their journey into the wild  north, where they encounter a beautiful witch and a dangerous race of  intelligent giants.  It's a well-done piece of storytelling, worth reading  a second time!	1999-06-02

Madden clearly loves the game of football, and his exuberance is evident throughout this book.  His stories and anecdotes from both his coaching and broadcasting days are both  hilarious and insightful.  My own favorite part of this book were his  reminisces of his days with the Raiders, when he coached that team to their  first Superbowl victory.  He really makes you feel like you were there!	1999-05-27

I never really got to like Johnny Rico very much, but his story is certainly an interesting one.  The constant flashbacks from his days as a  fighting M.I. trooper to his high school memories to his boot-camp training  days keep this novel moving at a fast pace.  Johnny always seems to be at  the low end of the totem pole, just barely surviving to advance to the next  level.  But he's still a bit smug at times, and I just never felt much  sympathy for him.  And while I don't necessarily disagree with Heinlein's  political views, I got tired of his trying to bring in every single  geographical group of people on the planet into the military.  It smacked  of those modern, politically correct Saturday morning cartoons, where every  little group of kids has a representative of every race &amp; religion  among them.  In the same fashion, Johnny's unit is made up of people from  every single country on the planet.  It just seems too contrived to be  real.	1999-05-24

The seeds planted in the Sixties are in full bloom today, and this extraordinary book illustrates just how our current messed-up values got to be accepted as &quot;politically correct&quot; thinking.  Many of the 60's  radicals documented in this book are today highly respected members in our  body politic, and it's almost scary to think they still harbor that same  destructive leftist ideology under a modern veneer of centrist-Clintonism.	1999-05-20

I really liked this book at the start, but then Goodkind's plot ventured into that whole dominance-submission-mistress-slave thing, and I wondered what the hell was going on!  I finished this book, but was highly  disappointed with what I considered to be a totally inappropriate  plot-twist.  It was just weird!	1999-05-18

Harry Harrison's sci-fi parody is still funny, even now, over thirty years after it was written!  It's kind of like a spoof of &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, what with the boot-camp training followed by a merciless  war against alien creatures from another galaxy.  Bill is a likeable sort,  who hardens after his miserable experiences as a trooper in the service of  the emperor.  This is a very funny and enjoyable book, without a lot of  bowb!	1999-05-18

Maybe it's just me, but when I want to read about lesbian S&amp;M I like a degree of sexual attraction involved in one or both parties.  This book seriously lacked this.  The main character just seemed to want to beat the  daylights out of the other women in her platoon.  Was she attracted to  them?  Were they attracted to her?  No and no.  If this book wants to be  classified as erotica then I would have to say the author failed to  deliver.	1999-05-17

But Amarantha Knight wants to jazz it  up, which is fine.  The two girls engage in some hot dominance &amp;  submission, with spankings and lesbian sex --- I'm all for it!  But WHY  does the author then feel compelled to add everybody else in the  household?!!  The father, the neighbors, the visitors from Ohio, the local  sock merchant, etc. etc. etc.  Eventually, it just gets too crowded, and an  erotic story turns into everyone doing everyone.  But it's just not erotic  --- it's BORING!!!  It got to the point where I never even finished my  copy.  Better to turn on the TV and watch Baywatch re-runs.	1999-05-17

People who hate Rush Limbaugh very rarely argue on the merits of what he actually writes, because he's so very hard to contradict with facts!  So instead they resort to name-calling and saying he's a demagogue.  But read  this book, and tell me where he's wrong!  I can't find it!  Rush is America  at its best &amp; brightest!	1999-05-07

I still enjoy reading some of these books even now, and I'm far from childhood!  I think the best books are those in the middle of the series, with my personal favorites being &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot; and  &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;.  I can't say this series is superior to  Tolkien's &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, but for a younger audience it's  perfect!	1999-05-07

Right from the start I was hooked!  But in all honesty, I must say by the fifth book in this series he was losing his edge!  If you read the whole thing, you'll see  what I mean.  Still, he's a great writer, and this series of books was his  masterpiece!	1999-04-25

I didn't particularly like &#34;Sword of Shannara&#34; because I thought it was too much of a Tolkien rip-off.  And I've never liked the way Terry Brooks spends so much time dealing with the psychology of whether or not to  use this weapon or that weapon (e.g. elfstones).  So when I read  &#34;Elfstones of Shannara&#34; I wasn't overly optimistic I'd like it.  But I was never so pleasantly surprised to be wrong!  This is a GREAT BOOK!  There are so many exciting scenes, from the druid's frightening foray into  the long abandoned keep, to the terrifying encounters with the Reaper in the forest and on the bridge, to the very moving ending --- I loved this book!  It's one of the few novels I enjoy reading over & over!  An excellent  story!  On the negative side, if you go on to read &#34;Wishsong of  Shannara&#34;, expecting it to be anywhere near this good, you'll be disappointed!	1999-04-25

While the overly-cute baby animal dialogues, not to mention the endless descriptions of their food, sometimes get on my nerves, these Redwall novels really have me hooked!  I've read them all --- every single one of  them!  Brian Jacques has an excellent imagination, and his stories really  do make me interested in what's going on!  This is the first one to include  a major battle between good and evil armies, but I've noticed that  bloodshed is a common occurence in these otherwise very gentle little  animal stories.	1999-04-20
