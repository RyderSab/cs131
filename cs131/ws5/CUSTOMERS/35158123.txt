I was willing to ignore all of these pretty huge mistakes until I read what he had to say about my former employer and place of employment on pages 80 and 140.  <br />If he'd bother to ask a few questions, he may have discovered that these highschool band kids often run into \\"cheesy clubs\\" such as the Tropical Isle and steal money off the bar. He may have discovered that the \\"fat white man\\" who ran out of the bar to \\"shoo\\" (trust me when I say Mr. Earl does not shoo anyone) these poor unfortunates away is a champion of local music and culture. That when he found out that the Chicken Man's (local character who used to sell incense to the bartenders and tourists and who earned his moniker by biting the heads off live chickens in a 1950's nightclub act) ashes were sitting on a shelf in a local funeral home because his daughter couldn't afford to pay for the cremation, he paid not only for the ashes, but a full funeral complete with a second line that had Bourbon street immobilized for the entire day. That the Handgrenade man is usually someone that he's rescued from homelessness by giving him a job that pays well, the opportunity for promotion and often an apartment. That his employees stay with him for years and not only because of the high pay, medical, dental, 401k and life insurance he pays a great deal of money for. That the Tropical Isle has hosted as regular performers the likes of Timothea, Jon Gros and Al Miller. <br />Instead, he chose to imagine a sterotypical greedy white Southern man victimizing the downtrodden youth of color. <br />Oh and the Handgrenade is not \\"an icky concoction of rum and sweet syrups.\\" It is quite tasty and hasn't a drop of rum in it. <br />	2005-04-23

It sells itself as some sort of Southern Gothic Romance, not exactly my cup of tea.  <br />Boy, was I surprised! <br />Filled with flawed, eccentric and charming characters, The Rock Orchard shows you that, like love, kindness can come from unexpected places and in unlikely forms. The antics of these endearing characters range from awe-inspiring to hilarious.  <br />While there's a fair amount of sex in it, this book is not a romance novel. Details are not gone over with a theausauraus of sexually explicit terms. What is described is what's needed to justify the feelings and actions of the characters. <br />More than anything The Rock Orchard is a small town character study, full of believable and charming character that, inevitably, you wish lived down the street.	2005-03-30

The characters are pretty well fleshed out and the relationships, for the most part, are very believable and sympathetic.  The plot is a good mix of an old-fashioned Hammettesque detective story and modern day mystery.  My main problem is the observations, obviously from a post 9/11 perspective, of 1980's New York. I mean, come on, why would a 1983 detective be looking for the twin towers, thinking that \\"the skyline wouldn't look right without them?\\"   Over all, I enjoyed the characters enough to try another Moe Prager mystery. It's a decent, light read for a Saturday afternoon.	2005-03-27

The first thing that struk me about Harold's End was the physical beauty of the book itself. The cloth binding, with the watercolor of the protagonist is breathtaking. Even the ribbon bookmark is lovely. The illustrations are stunning! <br />The short story itself, while ending on a somewhat hopeful note, just plain broke my heart. I so desprately wanted this little boy to have someone he could really trust and count on. And Harold.... I spent every page, terrified for that endearing little snail. <br />The writing was, as always with J.T. LeRoy, top notch. Every character and situation felt as real as real can be. And the characters were some of the most awkward and sympathetic on paper. <br />This IS a short story, so please don't buy this lovely work of art expecting a fully developed novel, with backstory and all that. Expect a brief and touching snapshot out of the life of a damaged, wonderful street kid. <br />	2005-03-27

A full blown (but not unbelievable) mystery ensues, with lots of sexual tension. <br />I loved Ricky's reaction to the differences between Dallas and New Orleans.

In an age where women were little more than pieces of property, Borgia was an expert administrator, beloved by her people and relied on by her husbands. <br />Considering all of that, Sarah Bradford must be some kind of literary genius to have made her biography the most boring thing I've ever read. <br />Lucrezia's achievements and trials are barely glossed over while her wardrobe is accounted in minute detail. Her notorious romances are treated like a mere side-note to her hair care regime. <br />I hope someone writes a decent biography of this amazing woman someday!	2005-01-23

She's presented us with a very strong theory of who Jack the Ripper was.<BR>The only things she has conclusively proved are: 1: that Walter Richard Sickert wrote some of the Ripper letters (including one that came with a kidney). 2: That more of the ripper letters were written by the same person than previously thought (the use of paint rather than ink, watermarks and language point to one writer). 3: That Walter Richard Sickert was not a very nice guy and had a facination with the violent deaths of women. 4: That Walter Richard Sickert prefered the kind of women in the original five Ripper murders.<br />I doubt the evidence that Ms. Cornwell provides would pass the reasonable doubt requirement with a jury. Then again, I doubt that enough evidence even still exists to convict anyone of these crimes.<br />Sickert is definately someone ripperologists should give a closer look.<br />Her evidence (or lack of) aside, Portrait of a Killer offers a rare view into the underbelly of Victorian England and a fairly entertaining read.	2004-07-09

I almost went a little misty reading the description of how G-Man felt about Ricky.
