The whole series has been an interesting exploration of the whole vampires/werewolves/witches are real plot device and Ms. Hamilton has pulled it off with panache.  The characters are believeable and she has done a great job making believeable characters out fo the monsters who actually seem to think differently than we do.  Beyond that, the books are generally filled with rich dialog and are well written in general. <br /> <br />So, what happened?!  For one thing, not much happens in the book save the development of the relationships between the various characters.  Now, this is nothing to sneer at, since it's those characters that I have come to enjoy.  However, the action-plot is an afterthought, taking up maybe a tenth of the book.  So, it's a quieter book that will focus on the characters, an interlude if you will.  That would be fine except the first half of the book focusses on the B-Team characters that I just don't care about.  Damian, Nathaniel, etc?  Don't care what happens to them.  It's not until the half-way mark that Richard finally enters and then the book begins to work.  I care about the primary triumverate, not the lesser characters.  When it starts focussing on Jean-Claude and Richard, I became interested.  I'd also like to see a spinoff series about Sgt Hudson and his SWAT team, please! <br /> <br />My other problem is the sex.  I like the sex in these books when it is fairly restrained.  In this book, it just goes on and on and on and. . .  In small doses, it works.  When we get the 5th sequence in the book describing in exhaustive detail every last grope and stroke between some screwed-up sexual encounter, it gets boring.   <br /> <br />Honestly, I think this book is a placeholder.  We have Jean Claude, Anita, and Richard finally beginning to come together.  Their powers have increased significantly.  We see the they have begun to recruit warriors instead of strippers to their ranks.  We know that malcolm has unleashed a ticking timebomb of screwed-up vampires all over the country.  It doesn't take a genius to see that something big is coming, something really big.  This book strikes me as a somewhat clumsy attempt to get these characters ready for that encounter.   <br /> <br />I give the first half of the book 2 stars and the second half 4, so my average is 3.	2005-07-29

Then look elsewhere, you'll find almost none of that here.  What you will find are 128 pages full of ~4 crystal clear photos of everything that you could want for the Falcon.  You want 3 photos of the refueling port showing exactly how it folds down as well as a lovely phot of the interior of the port?  It's here.  Want 4 photos of the new stiffners added to the fuselage?  It's here.  Want 12 pages of photos of the -A cockpit, 6 of the -C, and 2 pages just covering the ejector seat?  Here you go.  Want 2 pages of the AIM-120 AMRAAM missile, another 2 of AAQ-14 Lantirn pod, and many other armaments including a full page of artwork showing all the things you can hang on a F-16?  Yup, it's here.  Does it have plans, you ask?  Not only does it have plans of the plane, it has 6 pages of plans for the cockpits showing every knob, switch, and what have you. <br /> <br />This is a fantastic model reference.

What a suprise.  As the title indicates, it covers the bombers in development from the end of WW2 to the fall of the Soviet empire and a bit beyond.  Being a huge fan of \\"paper-projects\\" this book is right up my alley, going into detail on the various bombers and ground-attack planes that were in the design phase.  Like the British works, this book covers the bombers that went into service as well, which ties in nicely with the background of the bombers that never were. <br /> <br />If I have to offer a criticism, it's that there aren't more photos and diagrams.  Each bomber gets at least a photos or drawing, no matter how obscure.  However, when they cover almost were's like the Tu-64 I want more photos, shots of the mock-up, etc.  Offer me a feast and I'll want desert, I suppose. <br /> <br />I imagine that this series will follow the British ones, where we will next get a book on fighter developments of the same period, followed by a book on fighter and bomber projects of WW2.  I can only hope that after this they will turn to the Japanese experimental planes of WW2 and a similar trilogy on the US aircraft projects.  As I'm not sure if there are sufficient aircraft to warrant a book on the Italian projects of WW2, this extended series will become the primary reference for secret aircraft projects for the last 70 years. <br /> <br />If you have any interest in the subject, buy this book.  It's that good. <br /> <br />Matt	2005-03-11

What this book is is a compilation of articles from prominent holocaust deniers, many pretty thoroughly discredited.  The problem is that the arguments are rather traditional, using theroies that were generally blown apart from an evidence standpoint long ago.  While the mental gymnastics are entertaining, they lack the creative spark that one might hope for.  In essence, if you are going to spew the idea that the Jews just wandered off, at least come up with something new.  Space aliens is a good one and hasn't been done yet.      Kidding aside, the book is a pasted together compilation of poorly constructed excuses for the Nazis and their genocidal actions.  It fails as serious scholarship and has barely a passing aquaintence with any type of scientific examinations of the existing evidence.  If you want to reinforce beliefs that the evil Jews made the whole Holocaust up and aren't troubled by poor writing and reasoning, you'll enjoy this book.  For anyone else, it's not really worth your time.  (...)	2005-01-31

Therefore, it SHOULD be a by-the-numbers, weak, poorly written piece of fluff.  The thing is, it isn't at all.  This may well be one of the finest Star Wars books out there, and since I've read pretty much all of them since I first clutched the Star Wars novelization in my hands back in 1977, I've a basis for comparison. <br /> <br />First off, this is a suprisingly decent special operations novel.  The author obviously did a bunch of researh and her influence by the British side of the house, namely the SAS/SBS, is evident.  It's almost a shame that this is a Star Wars novel, since it is significantly better than a lot of the pap out there that passes for a technothriller or SOF novel but the Star Wars title will keep a lot of those readers from giving it a chance. <br /> <br />Second, the book has no characters that we are familiar with from previous movies or books but instead a host of new ones, yet deftly sketches them as characters who are better fleshed out and more alive than characters who've been in multiple books (I'm looking at you, NJO series). The inexperienced Jedi could have been by the numbers, but instead she is fully realized character with an honest to goodness character arc. The commandos could have been characterless, grunting SF stereotypes and instead they are new and different, giving us an idea of what someone trained for 10 years of an accelerated life might be like.  <br /> <br />Finally, the book subtly but surely gives us a greater understanding of the Star Wars universe.  Sure, we're supposed to see that the Jedi have lost their way, their sense of the force diminishing.  However, when we read of the clone commandos; how they were raised, how they were trained, how they are used, we begin to understand the depth to which the Jedi have lost their way.  Disposable troops, brutally trained with massive training losses, and no luxuries or pleasures allowed until they get used up and replaced are exacly what the Jedi should be against.  Instead, they use them, living men genetically brainwashed to serve the Jedi, as if they were droids.  Certainly, they are the difference between victory and defeat but where are the Jedi demanding better treatment for their warriors?  Where is their compassion for all things in the force?  Here we get our best glimpse yet of the difference between what the Jedi profess to do and what they actually do before the fall. <br /> <br />All in all, this is an excellent book.  If LucasFilm has any sense, they will sign Ms. Traviss to more books immediately.  Either show out commando squad again or show them with more familiar Jedi or just give her a more standard style of book.  Whichever, they had best not let her slip away.  This book was good enough that I'll buy any book of hers, sight unseen, from now on until disappointed.  I have few authors that I'll say that of.	2004-11-27

I am certainly part of the target audience for this book, being pretty disgusted with the Clinton duo.  However, what I hoped for was a factual tome of the flaws, failings, and deceit of the junior senator from NY.  What I got was a repetetive, smarmy, and poorly constructed screed against her that offered little new information and was so partisan in tone that it became untrustworthy even as a source of dirt. Authors on both sides of the political debate need to realize that too snippy a tone tends to turn off the average reader.   <br /> <br />In more detail, the book is full of allegations of radical beliefs, wretched interpersonal skills, and bald-faced deceit but precious few illustrations of same.  Don't tell me that Senator Clinton is a horrid person to work for with no sense of two-way loyalty, give me examples.  Don't quote the radicals who supposedly influenced her beliefs, show me examples of her demonstrating those beliefs. <br /> <br />In short, while there is some interesting information in this book, it misses the mark.  It could have been an exhaustive record of the senator's changing of beliefs, opportunism, and political deceit.  Intead, we get an annoyingly repetetive and shrill attack without a great deal of substance.  For anyone but those who simply want to nod and agree without learning anything new, this book is a wash.	2004-08-18

While there are a fair number of good, clear photos of the class from WW2 to their retirement, it is the plans that make this book so valuable.  A few representative carriers are given full 3 page wide side and top views.  For the rest, you get plans of each deck, plans of the different islands, plans of all of the armaments fitted and the radar installations, etc.  For the modeler, this is the best resource out there.  The Anatomy of the Ship book on the Intrepid is a close second but suffers in that it only represents one specific carrier.  If you're interested in excellent and thorough plans of the wartimne Essex carriers, this is your book.  Add the Intrepid book and you're thoroughly covered.  if you're interested in the post-war modifications than this book will also serve your purposes.	2004-05-10

However, it's not really a technical history of the Essex class carriers.  Sure, it spends a chapter or two describing the design genesis for the ship but that is not the bulk of the book.  The bulk of the book is a synopsis of every major and most minor actions that involved Essex-class fleet carriers from WW2 to Vietnam.  As such, much of the book is only somewhat related to the Essex carriers and describes the actions that they served in.  This is not a criticism, as this stuff is very well done, but rather an observation.  While there are photos, there aren't a lot of them and the drawings are few and somewhat simplified.  If you're looking for model reference, this isn't the book for you.<br />My one real criticism of the book is that it is too short.  There are small sections or even paragraphs that dropped tantalizing tidbits of information that I would have loved to see covered at length.  There's a paragraph that describes the shakedown process of the carriers in a sheltered and mined deep water bay.  This is a subject that there is almost no reference on and I would have loved to see more on it.  There are several sections like that where I grow really interested and then it's over in a few lines.<br />All that said, if you want a book that covers all of the facets of the Essex class, from development to service, to modifications, to a list of all of the carriers built; this is your book.	2004-05-04

Well written, very well illustrated, it is truly comprehensive.  From design, to flight operations, to the evolution of its mission this book covers them all and covers them well.  It also covers the never produced follow-up designs that you won't find references for anywhere else, they even have drawings of them.<br />I don't give many &quot;5&quot;s for books, this one deserves it.  The author is to be congratulated for doing this fine a job.  This is one of the few books where I wasn't wishing for more detail or information in any section because they are already comprehensive and yet entertaingly written.	2004-05-04

The techniques are very interesting and, perhaps more importantly, reflect the basic body movements (taijutsu) of Dr. Hatsumi's system.  Even for those who are training in another art, there is a great deal of useful information as to how one might incorporate knives and especially guns into your own method of natural body movement.  <br />Perhaps more importantly, the book illustrates two fundamental concepts quite well.  The first might be seen as defensive offense.  By this I mean that most of the techniques show an agressive attack that, at the same time, utilizes positioning and a knowledge of the bodies movement capabilities to protect you when you execute the technique.  This is a defense not just to the weapon in question but also to the person wielding it.  One will find when playing with a rubber gun that many standard techniques will bring the muzzle of the gun or the edge of the knife into a position where the enemy can use it against you.  This book provides info into how you can keep from putting yourself at risk while executing a technique.  The second concept is that the weapon is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.  Your &quot;job&quot; is to disable your attacker so that they are not a threat.  If firing the gun into their body works, fine.  If not, the gun can be used as a striking object, a piece of misdirection, etc.  The knife can cut or it can be used to trap an opponent's limb.  This reduction of the hallowed weapon to a mere tool on the level of your hand or foot, albiet with a recognition of its different capabilities) is important.  Far too many people will focus on the weapon as what they &quot;have&quot; to attack with, even if it's not the best choice at that moment.<br />The book suffers from two things.  In my copy at least, the paper quality is similar to newspaper, which makes the photos dark and several are difficult to make out.This is agravated by the fact that a few of the techniques are shown in less frames than you need to understand how they got from photo 3 to photo 4.  Not a problem if you have a competent sensei to assist you but it can make things difficult if you're trying to learn from the book only.  The second thing is that the boo is a translation from Japanese and the English sections are a bit clunky.<br />All of this said, this is a fine book and very useful.  It's a shame that it's out of print and some of the used prices are amazingly high when it's available at all!	2004-03-30

I am grateful to Mr. Michael Licari, who provided a fine review in enough detail that I don't need to waste more time with this book to write one of my own.  To my mind, this book illustrates the all too common use of a provocative title and uneven research to sell a book. When one can claim Suvorov (Rezun) as a pivotal source one needs to revaluate their acceptance criteria.  <br />In short, it is a poorly reasoned screed that is authoritatively written so that one can be mislead into believing that the author knows what he is talking about.  While there are a few worthy points in the book they aren't worth the sorting reqired to find them.	2004-02-02

Full of hundreds of crisp and clear photos of the every detail of the tank these books are invaluable to modellers and those who want to know about the tank.  The only slight mark against the book is that it is indeed a development history of the tank and as such has very little on the operational use of the tank.<br />His books are the gold standards for American AFV's and probably will be for a very long time to come.	2003-09-21

This book is full of some very well done 1/48th models of the various marks of Mustangs.  Typically, they are built straight from the box with the addition of aftermarket cockpit detail sets and, in one example, a full engine.  What makes this book so frustrating is that the cockpits are so well done in the book, as are the beautiful metal finishes yet they don't give much instruction on how they were done.  Since the models seem to have been built by several different modellers there are several different styles of cockpit detailing and painting and most every modeler has something that you will want to emulate on your own models.  Too bad, because nothing in the text will tell you how to do it.  For example, there is a cockpit in there that has a stunningly good natural wood cockpit floor achieved by paint alone.  Think that they'll tell you how to do it?  Nope, they don't.  There is a cockpit frame that has a great shadowing detail done between the natural metal frame and the glass.  Nothin in the text even mantions it, much less tells you how to do it.  Subtle shading around a colorful paintjob on a tail or nose and again, nothing in the text even mentions it.<br />In effect, the title of this book is incorrect, this is not really a modelling manual since it gives very little instruction on how to actually improve your technique.  What it is is a collection of photos of some very well painted models (interestingly, little to nothing is improved on the model outside of the cockpit, some gunbays, and the one engine so that poorly fitting parts are still poorly fitting, the panel under the nose being a prime example) that will hopefully inspire you but will lead to some real frustration as to how to learn the techniques used.<br />I wish that Osprey would re-release this book with some informative text so that we modellers could learn how to do these things.	2003-09-20

Let me start by saying that this is an excellent book, I have no reservations about saying that.  It contains a wealth of knowledge on the Kaiser's tanks and if you want anything more than the blurbs in the Schiffer series (not knocking them, for $12 thier book on the A7V is a steal) this is it, the only book that you'll need and the only one out there! It contains several detail drawings and what have you.<br />However, it is not everything that a modeller could hope it to be.  The interior shots are somewhat limited, being either the few period shots still out there as well as plenty of photos of Mephisto.  Unfortunately, Mephisto has no driver's station so there is scant reference on it. Frankly, from a modeller's standpoint, the Schiffer title holds up pretty well.<br />In sum, it's a very good book on the A7v, you'll never see a better one.  That said, it is not equivalent to a Jentz book in photographic coverage and those who buy it for that will be somewhat disappointed.  Of course, how many photos of a few dozen tanks from WW1 can one expect to survive?  <br />I'm very happy with this book, but I paid $30 for it.  For the $120-150 that the used book-sellers are often asking, I'd be a bit heisitant.<br />Matt	2003-09-09

This one is first-rate.  It takes the time to discuss the context of Force Recon, talking not just about them (although they make up the majority of the book) but what a MEU is, what the difference is between Force Recon and Battalion Recon, etc.  Be aware that it is an overview book, so you're not getting 300 pages of info like, say, &quot;Brave Men, Dark Waters&quot; does for the SEALs.  Hopefully, someday somebody will write such a book but until then, this is all that you've got and it's pretty darned good.<br />For someone who wants to know the basics of Force Recon or how Force Recon is different than the Navy SEALs, this is a great choice. There are other good books on Force Recon, such as the excellent &quot;Inside Force Recon: Recon Marines in Vietnam&quot;<BR>by Michael Lanning, but they are more memoirs than overviews so often don't explain the basics that people might be interested in. <br />Matt	2003-09-05

In fact, it pales even next to the Next Generation Companion.<br />Why?  Content.  Let's look at the deep Space Nine Companion.  With the same cover price, it includes 725 pages versus the 528 in the Voyager book.  What does it do with those extra 200 pages?  It goes into several pages on each season, filled with anecdotes and explanations for why things happened as they did.  Most every episode warrants 2-3 pages of synopsis and back-stage information, often with quite revealing information.  Even if you watched every episode there will be plenty of new information and backstory. It was also enjoyable just to read.<br />The Voyager book?  2-3 pages of overview for each season, counting an almost full page cast photo.  Each episode is largely covered with just a rather terse synopsis with minimal background and cast/crew recollections.  That's it.  Bare-bones to say the least.  One would be better off saving their money and going to any one of the hundreds of Voyager fan sites on the net and printing out their synopsis collection.<br />All in all, a very disappointing effort, easily the worst of all of the Star Trek Companions.  If you really want it for completeness sake, I'd advise waiting a year or so until there are several in the bargain aisle of your local bookstore ...  ... this book should have been on par with the DS9 book, and it falls far short of that level.	2003-05-12

The purpose of this book is to show all of the nuts and bolts of the Apache for people building model-kits of the helicopter.  It does not give technical data or show action shots, rather it is an exhaustive photo-collection of the Apache.  It does that very well.  It's a good buy for anyone building a model of the Apache who wants to super-detail the heck out of  it.	2002-12-18
US	52325842	R1SF2O007R1Z8O	034544891X	210480571	Blood Warriors: American Military Elites	Books	1	3	5	N	N	Not impressed and a letdown for this author	It's difficult to believe that this book was written by the same man who wrote the excellent (if a bit dry) books about the Vietnam era Recon Marines and LRRPs. I get the impression that the book was quickly written to take advantage of the recent interest in the special operations elites of the US militaries.<br />Firstly, there is nothing new here at all. The background of the units might be of interest for those who don't want to buy a book dedicated to the individual units. However, it is quite abbreviated. The coverage of the units in the current day is even worse, there is nothing in there that is not covered more completely and for free on the web at sites like specialoperations.com or what have you. In addition, several of the entries, most notably the Delta Force one, looks like all of the research was done by reading older books on the subject already out there. The old story of Delta Force's racism is brought up again, which has as its sole source a poorly written special operations overview by an Italian author whose title I won't dignify by repeating. The fact that people, including former black Delta Force members have denied this is not even mentioned. The fact that most special operations forces have low nmumbers of minorities is never mentioned, except in the SF section where it is carefully explained away socially. <br />This book may have some use if you know nothing about these units and would like a relatively cheap primer. However, there are vastly better books already out there so save your money. And that is my main complaint with the book.  There are already better books out there that do the same overview of America's units. Douglass Waller's \\"The Commandos\\" and David Bohrer's \\"America's Special Forces\\" come to mind.  In addition, it repeats myths as fact, seemingly taken out of older, innaccurate books.  In short, it's a book that tries to do what other books have already done and it does it poorly.  It is simply another superficial \\"quickie overview of all of America's elite units or at least the ones with name recognition\\" book in a shelf already crowded with those books.  From an author like this, who is simply the gold standard for special forces books along with Kevin Dockery, it is a true letdown.  Also, the repeating every or two pages of the term \\"blood warriors\\" gets old, awfully fast.  This seems to be the case of an exceptional author who, in this case, wrote a poor book.<br />Matt	2002-11-07

Several of his books and short-stories are included in my all-time favorite tales, periodically pulled off the shelf and read again and again.  However, he falters a bit here, at least in my opinion.  Several stories are excellent, Road Virus Heads North, The Man in the Black Suit, Everything's Eventual, and L.T.'s Theory of Pets are all fine reads, showing yet again that Mr. King is NOT a hack writer who got lucky but rather a skilled master of the writing craft.  In one sentence he can make a character feel real and alive.<br />Unfortunately, the quality of the stories is variable. Lunch at the Gotham Cafe, Little Sisters, etc. simply aren't up to his usual standards.  They're not bad but they simply aren't as fine as what he has shown that he can write.  1408, in particular, is a heart-breaker.  It's excellent until our writer enters that room, than it falls apart.  It seemed that he was shooting for a Lovecraftian feel at that point and it just didn't work, sadly.<br />All of that said, there are gems in here.  However, you have to dig for them.  It's worth picking up but perhaps a wait for the paperback is in order.<br />Matt	2002-10-08

This is one of the great ones.  Why?  Because it takes a theme that has been done to death, the training of the Navy SEALs, and writes what is probably the definitive book on the subject while doing what none of the other books has done.  For the first time, a book follows the trainees through BUDs, through Hell Week, and keeps going all of the way to the assignment to an active team.  It emphasizes the fact that the vaunted Hell Week, long portrayed as the horrible endurance contest that it is, is in fact just one of the gut checks along the way to becoming a SEAL.  It's not a magical peak where everything after is easy, it's a point that weeds out many but is more preparation for the rigors ahead than a line to cross.  To put it bluntly, there is no need to write another book on the training of the Navy SEALs, this is the final word. If you have dreams of becoming a SEAL, read this book.  There is much wisdom in these pages.  Ever think that \\"your reputation begins at BUDs\\"?  You'll learn that here.  <br />Finally, a book that reaches the levels set by books such as \\"Brave Men, Dark Waters\\" and \\"Class-29 : The Making of U.S. Navy SEALs\\".  Well written, insightful, and just simply excellent.  Buy this book!<br />Matt	2002-05-18

In essence, it is yet another book intent on proclaiming that, in reality, the civil war was caused by...Lincoln and his willing dupes, geared towards a fascist state whose only aim was to crush the voices of freedom, interestingly congregated in the south.

First off, it has a definite agenda to it.  It is very pro Army SF.  Hey, nothing wrong with that.  However, he slaps the Navy SEALs on at least a couple of occasions amoung others, which is unwarranted.  In real life, most members of units like the Navy SEALs, Army SF, USMC Recon, AF PJ's and CT's respect each other and feel little need to denigrate each other.  So, strike 1.<br />Strike 2 is how cursory the information is.  Read Walker's \\"Commandos\\" for a much better over-view of the SF.  This book goes into detail over the components of the MRE or what have you but glosses over things like the missions of the SF.  Heck, the average TLC or Discovery Channel documentary has more information about these units than this book.  Actually, there's more good information on-line at Socnetcentral.com than here. Very disappointing. For interests sake check how many details don't jibe with what is published in better books or just by asking a SF member.  We're not talking altered for OPSEC here, it's just poorly researched.<br />Strike 3?  The paper is barely newsprint and the pictures are grainy [...].  <br />In sum, if you know nothing at all about the US Army's SF, maybe this book is worth a look see if better books like \\"America's Special Forces : Weapons, Missions, Training\\" by David Bohrer or <BR>\\"U.S. Army Special Forces\\" by Fred Pushies are out of stock.  If you are hoping to learn more about them than are in these books, I'd recommend enlisting and practicing your land navigation skills.  You sure won't find it here.	2001-11-01

Books	1	18	52	N	N	I apologize	If you look a bit further you will see another review by me of this book, giving it 5 stars.  All I can say is that I was, young, I was foolish, I was duped.  This book reads quite well but, alas, has about as much basis in reality as my claim to be king of the moon.  When you research the claims in this book, as I should have the first time, you find that none hold up.  Was Stalin planning to attack Europe?  Yeah, he probably was, although by his own admission not until '43-44.  He had lots of tanks, but very few KV's and T-34s.  Most were lousy BT series deathtraps.  His army was in disarray, his airforce was poor, etc.  <br />Just as one cite, the book claims that the Soviet BT series was ordered because the tracks could be removed to run on the new German autobahns that Hitler was building.  One problem, the Soviets started building Christie style tanks before Hitler even came to power and several years before he started building the autobahns.  Oops.<br />Never mind that in his other books, especially the Spetsnaz book, he paints a glowing picture that, now that westerners have actually gone and met with the people that he wrote about, is exposed a bunch of BS, fairy-stories of supermen to better sell books to westerners who want to read of real-life James Bonds.  Inshort, he writes whatever will sell the most books, cheerfully mixing fact and fiction secure in the knowledge that at the time no-one could check his sources.<br />As I said, the book is garbage.  Pick up &quot;Stumbling Colossus&quot; to get an idea of what the Soviet military looked like on the eve of war and judge for yourself whether the Soviets could have handled invading my Aunt Matildas flower garden, much less the Europeans.	2001-07-26

At the time of publication, every classified species was included, along with pertinent details and from 1-3 pages of write-up.  It talks of the holotypes, it has 1-2 photos on every page, it gives it all.  It is exhaustive, well written, and just simply outstanding.  Put it this way, paleontologists and reconstructionist-artists keep this on their desk like the military folk keep a copy of Jane's, it's simply far and away the best reference on the various species of dinosaurs.  Is it pricey? Yup.  However, you could easily spend far more buying every dinosaur encyclopedia sold on Amazon and still come up with a fraction of the material that is in this book.  To be blunt, no other reference is in it's class.  Throw in that periodic supplements are published that describe all of the new species and information discovered from the previous release, and you simply can't go wrong.<br />If I have to pick one flaw, it's that some of the photographs are of poor quality, however most of these seem to be because the only surviving photo is a zerox or what have you, so the quality is dependant on the source picture, not due to any corner-cutting (of which there seems to be NONE) in the book.	2001-07-24

For the effort and success that was spent on this book to make it credible it would deserve 4 or 5 stars.  The problem is, it's bunk.  I bought the book and read it, and got suitably outraged at the fact that all of this had been witheld.  Outraged enough that I had to figure out if it were true.  So I spent more time than I care to think about checking the references and tracking down the facts behind his assertions.  To be blunt, most don't hold up. <br />To cite just one example, he mentions that the US was tracking the fleet via radio signals and cites much decoded traffic in support.  What he glosses over is that the traffic in question comes from before the fleet sailed and after it had attacked with a large gap during the time that the fleet was at sea.  In addition, every (and I mean EVERY) Japanese crewman from the fleet who has talked aboput it has steadfastedly maintained that there was no radio-traffic at all.  All communication was with flags and lights, planes had their radios disconnected, etc.  So, we have no message traffic records for the US intercept services and the Japanese confirm that nothing was sent.  Yet, this book cites these interceptions that apparently never happened as being a large part of the conspiracy.  This very hole in the message traffic has been often shown to have scared the war department very much, as they had lost track of carrier fleet!  They were convinced that it was heading for the Philipines and not Pearl, which was their fatal mistake.<br />Most of the book is like this, at first read compelling and damning but then falling to shreds when closely examined.<br />The simple fact is that the US was trying to avoid a war with Japan, an oil embargo was enacted long after the Japanese started slaughtering their estimated 50 million victims right around the time the Japanese began taking territory that was useful only for the attack on colonial provinces in the south ofAsia.  Once it became obvious that they were heading for a war an attempt was made to take the steam out of their drive peacefully.  The Navy itself was sending memos that asserted that the US Navy was ill-equipped and unprepared for a war.  If it was indeed a cnspiracy, it was one that was pursued by doing everything that was possible to have the US as unprepared and in the worst possible position for it.<br />Lots of research, well written, and the author should be ashamed of himself.	2001-06-26
US	52325842	RZLYC0J9ZLEYE	185367446X	999618445	Rising Sun Victorious	Books	4	22	27	N	N	5 stars for proffesionalism and 3 for possibility	These books have got to be a bear to write.  Although certainly there are a fair number of pivot points in history there are darn few major things that could have been dramatically different.  That means, for these books, that there is always a certain amount of hand-waving away of inconvenient facts to allow an alternate ending.  Although much of this book is not as strained as the invasion of Britain volume (which completely glosses over the fact that Germany had no means to cross the channel and no navy to contest the channel with the Royal Navy) it does have the requisite hand-waving.  The only real alternative is the invasion of the Soviet Union instead of an attack on Pearl Harbor which leads to some interesting and well explored speculation.  There is the requisite rewriting of the Pearl Harbor attack which, while including the blocking of the channel by the Nevada which is a good idea, has the requisite attack on the oil farms which, sadly for the author, were not nearly as easy to destroy as portrayed and would have required a third attack wave into rapidly stiffening resistance.  Most of the scenarios are like this, requiring careful ommision of inconvenient facts to allow the Japanese to win.  This is not a condemnation of the authors, simply a statement that the Japanese had a poor army, a decent but over-extended navy, poor resource-management and availability and were against a huge wealthy power.  The Japanese were overextended just taking what they had in the Pacific, no invasion of the US was seriously contemplated or possible.  No resources for the landing craft, no capability to refuel at sea, no way to transport the troops, etc.  They were destined to lose unless the US simply said &quot;to hell with it&quot;.  Even in that instance, the British and Australians would have fought on and perhaps done the job themselves.<br />That said, the book is quite readable, very well researched (even the ommissions are done in such a way that you realize theauthors knew of them and danced around them), interesting, and very well put together with fictional charts, OBs, etc.  It's an excellent effort marred only by the lack of an epilog describing what inconvenient facts were ommitted for the scenarios to work.  This ommission can make the reader think that a victorious Japan was quite possible had they been more savvy, when it was not.<br />Matt	2001-06-20

In my humble opinion, only her and John Ford's books actually could stand on their own as good reads without the Star Trek name.  Good, inventive characters, good plots, well written, entertaining; she's got them all covered.<br />That said, I'm rather peeved at Pocket for these books.  When your first $xx book ends at chapter 4 and the next $xx book starts at chapter 5, you know that you're getting ripped off.  This is one book at best split into two so that suckers who either want to see how the story turns out, like me, or those who just mindlessly buy every ST book will spend twice as much money.  Then, after spending $xx, you find that it ends in &quot;To be continued&quot;.  These books are simply setting the stage for the actual story.  Nothing much happens in them plot-wise that makes them worthwhile, rather they set up a premise for us to buy the book about later.<br />Had these books been put together as one paperback, I'd give them a 4 out of 5.  Since they took one book and split it into two, with a third to come, I give it a 1.  The book's a cheat.<br />Matt	2000-11-06

I've read most everything that Mr. Turtledove has come up with, and enjoyed most of it a great deal.  The original Videssos cycle was fantastic, Guns of the South was great, etc.  However, he seems to have  developed a penchant for taking great ideas and beating them literally to  death by stretching them over several books and dozens of characters.  This  book is a case in point.  During the first 3/4 of the book absolutely  nothing of substance happens.  Governments change, characters move around,  but nothing actually happens to further the plot.  The entire series of  books could have been easily condensed into 2 books that actually kept a  good pace.  Similarly, there are so many characters that the ones that we  like are never developed enough to take advantage of their potential, and  lots of characters that we care nothing for eat into the precious space of  those that we do.  It's as if Turtledove feels the need to show everything  that happens of any significance in this universe by actually placing  characters there, rather than conveying the same level of information in a  paragraph or two.  Thus, people like the Yeagers get short shift and  Monique and Lui Han eat up the space.  They don't actually do anything of  note, just are kind of there.<br />All in all, it's probably worth reading for  completeness' sake, but get it at the library or wait for paperback.  You  do not get ~$20 of value here, unless you only consider the sheer amount of  time needed to wade through it.<br />Turtledove is capable of much, much  better than this.	2000-05-01

It is an excellent introduction to realistic rapier combat, fettered only by the rules of anatomy, physiology, and physics  rather than the artificial constructs of sports-based fencing.  Taking his  cue primarily from period fencing manuals written by people who studied the  sword for self-defence and combat rather than medals and trophies he takes  you through the basic techniques of combative rapier combat.  It is worthy  of note that most of his detractors are experienced sports fencers whose  techniques are long since stripped of their martial value for the ability  to score points, often using techniques that would have gotten one killed  300 years ago.  Sadly, both sides are often convinced that they are on the  true path and that no accomodation is possible.  In this instance Mr.  Clements is far more on the side of the truth than his detractors.	2000-04-21

Not even so much as to what it details about the programs themselves, but what it says about the people who will use them.  From accounts about the Japanese WW2 BW program, with  members discussing, without a shred of remorse, performing live autopsies  without anesthetic or analgesics to the recent uses of biological agents by  Rhodesian and South African forces it shows that these dreadful weapons  will be used, have been used, and will be a major problem for decades to  come.  My only complaint with the book is the rather sensationalistic  writing style used, that occasionally renders the hard facts sounding more  like tabloid journalism.  This does a disservice to the wealth of factual  material in the book.<br />Despite this, this is a very worthwhile read.  Be  warned, there are parts that will make you out-and-out angry at what people  have done, and make you want them brought to justice and punishment.	2000-04-18

They are not presented as moustache-twirling  fiends, but rather as vigorous, focussed people so evil that they no longer  even recognize it in themselves.  These are people who honestly believe  that their worldview is right, in spite of the fact that it is dehumanizing  to their victims and serfs as well as themselves.  I find this far more  frightening than the popular view of racists who take delight in the fact  that they can hurt others and are out and out sadists who wallow in their  nastiness; rather they are akin to slaveowners, who were normal people who  thought of themselves as good, but meted out horrors to their slaves.<br />The  book itself is rather cleverly set out to where you often begin to like and  admire these Draka, whereupon they matter-of-factly discuss some common  atrocity that they perform and the reader is hit with a dash of cold water,  realizing that these seductive people are almost anti-human.  Tie this in  with &quot;Under the Yoke&quot; where we see exactly what these people are  capable of and I think you will get a rather clever peek into what true  evil is.<br />As for the military aspects, they work rather well.  In reality,  a force like the Draka would have changed the world far more than we see in  the novels before 1940, but it would have been an unrecognizable world to  the reader.  I think Stirling did as well as could be expected to put a  rather implausible scenario into a history that we would recognize.<br />All  in all, this is a good book in a good series.	2000-02-14

Many critical reviewers seem to have let their emotions overcome their judgement.<br />Basically the book proposes the theory that Stalin was barely  two weeks from starting his invasion of Europe when Hitler trumped him by  attacking the Soviet Union.  He draws on extensive Soviet documentation and  finally explains why the incredibly canny and ruthless Stalin was  supposedly caught napping.  He wasn't.<br />The problems start because A) most  of this documentation is new to the west and challenges many long-held  beliefs and &quot;facts&quot; and B) It is perceived as exonerating  Hitler.<br />A) is always a problem, nobody likes to give up institutionalized  facts.<br />B) is foolish.  No real historian doubts that Hitler and his Nazis  were vicious, evil people. Stalin might have forced Hitler's hand, but  Barbarossa or it's equivalent would have been eventually launched no matter  what.  Hitler was planning on attacking them back in '36. The year tnat the  attack would have been launched is the only change, and possibly the  outcome of that attack.  Hitler still would have taken Europe and Russia if  he could.  However, while recognizing Hitler's evil, one now has to accept  Stalin's. Of course, if either of them had not been there at that time, the  other probably would have taken Europe and Russia and still held them to  this day, so we are perhaps lucky that at least there were two monsters to  fight each other, as aopposed to only one who would have taken the  continent.	2000-02-11
