By the end of the book, I ended up with a list of 41 books I want to check out. :) So if you're stuck in the what-do-i-read-next mode, than this is a good place to get some ideas.	2004-05-28

Alice suddenly finds herself transported to 1998 Manchester and becomes the prime suspect in the Jigsaw Murders, as she tries to gather the pieces and find her way back home to her own time and reality. As she is escorted on her journey by Celia, an automated version of herself, she makes the acquaintance of many strange creatures, all suffering from Newmonia (not to be mistaken for pneumonia). In true Carroll fashion, Noon uses crazy wordplay throughout often confusing not only the fictitious characters, but the unsuspecting reader as well. I found this book very delightful!	2004-05-28

Lord of the Flies describes in detail the horrific exploits of a group of young boys who make an alarming transition from civilized to barbaric when they suddenly find themselves stranded on an island with no adults. Ralph is declared chief, and quickly determines that their main goal should be to keep a large fire burning so that passing ships will see the smoke and rescue them. There is a power struggle between Ralph and Jack, who is head of the hunters and obsessed with killing the pigs on the island. Jack finally wins and the majority of the boys decide to follow him, abandoning the efforts of the fire.<br />There were spots in which I found myself re-reading, trying to understand scenes being described. This book is written in the view of a young boy so the reader needs to understand that as a youth, his view of the world is somewhat limited; thus forcing the reader to imagine what the youth is describing with limited terms. There are many passages that require some adult interpretation and imagination. After adjusting to this style of writing, I became thoroughly absorbed by the story, finding my heart beating quickly near the end as I sympathized with Ralph and his efforts to remain civilized.	2004-05-28

It is about a World War II bombardier, Captain Yossarian, who desparately wants to be sent home but he is caught in the military's Catch-22. Catch-22 states that one can only be excused from flying missions on the grounds of insanity; one must request to be excused; one who requests to be excused is presumably in fear of his life, thus proof of his sanity so therefore he must continue to fly; one who is insane would not make the request and would continue to fly the missions despite the fact that he would be excused from them if he were to ask. The typical no-win situation. There are many characters presented in this book, adding to the confusion and enhancing the hilarity. The plot...well, there doesn't seem to be much of a plot but once the reader becomes caught up in the circular logic of the military, the plot doesn't seem important anyway. There are grisly moments of realism interspersed with the absurb humor. The time-line of the story is not chronological, but somehow it all makes sense. Throughout the book, I found myself cheering for Yossarian and his efforts, hoping that in all the confusion he would come out a winner in the end. If you enjoyed the T.V. series M*A*S*H, then you're sure to love this book as the writers of the sitcom were inspired by Joseph Heller's amazingly bizarre tale.	2004-05-28

Secretly, and against Japanese tradition at the time, Sano has an autopsy done on the three bodies only to discover that they were dead before their bodies were burnt. An orphan girl, Haru, is found near the scene but will not speak to anyone regarding the events. Against his better judgment, Sano asks his wife, Reiko, to assist him in interrogating the girl. Reiko is convinced of the Haru's innocence, despite the fact that she is a pathological liar. Investigating on her own, Reiko causes some stress on her marriage as she discovers that the Temple of the Black Lotus houses some very nasty secrets.

Snow White is seeking her Prince Charming, whose name is Paul. The wicked stepmother, whose name is Jane, is out to get Snow White. And one of the \\"dwarves\\", Bill, doesn't like to be touched...by anyone. Other than that, there wasn't much else I understood about this book. It was a very disjointed book. The writing was stilted and had the feel of a foreigner speaking in a second language. The conversations were completely unrealistic and the voices in my head, while reading, kept on speaking in a mechanical drone; no expression or hint of emotions. Really, really, really, wasn't worth the three evenings I spent reading it. I would be interested in knowing if anyone else has read and understood this book, but I certainly would not recommend purchasing it!	2004-05-13

Dominic feels that he is the sane one in the family in comparison to his paranoid schizophrenic twin brother Thomas; but he throught therapy, he learns that his sanity is questionable as well. Dominic has spent his entire life protecting his brother and continues to do so later in life when Thomas, making a sacrificial protest to stop the war in the Middle East, cuts off his own hand in a public library. Despite Dominic's efforts, Thomas is sent to a hospital for the dangerous mentally ill, which is more a prison than a hospital. Dominic is determined to free his brother and in the process, gains some insight on his own life. He begins to understand his step-father, whom he has hated most of his life. He learns to accept his ex-wife's new relationship without expressing hatred. But most importantly he learns to accept himself and his family without regret for their past mistakes. This was a very moving story. I found it very hard to stay emotionally detached from the characters. Wally Lamb has an unique ability to make his characters come to life! At first, you'll hate Dominic with his snotty, pessimistic attitude but in the end, even the reader learns something...how to feel compassion for a troubled soul.	2004-05-11

If you've ever wondered what it would have been like to live during the beginning of America, this is a wonderful book to read. Johnny Tremain is an historical novel about a young boy in colonial Boston. In the beginning, Johnny is an arrogant silversmith's apprentice but because of a work accident, his life changes quickly and he suddenly finds himself unwanted and alone. Through courage and the support of a new friend, he becomes a messenger boy on horseback for the Sons of Liberty and meets most of the famous founding fathers: John Adams, Sam Adams, James Otis, Paul Revere, and John Hancock. Knowing he can be trusted, he soon becomes a spy for the Sons of Liberty. Reading this book I could feel Johnny's excitment as he took part in the Boston Tea party and I could feel his sadness as he struggled with loss at the battles of Lexington and Concord. This book was well written, placing the reader back in time, wondering how such simple people could be so courageous during this turbulent time period.	2004-05-11

These fairies have attitude and aren't afraid to show it! I was very amused by all their technical gadnets that helped to create the illusion of such magical beings. Oh sure, they had their own amount of magic and rules to follow in order to keep their gifts, but this book was full of unexpected twists and turns and enough imginative inventions to intrigue even an adult reader.

Like so many of us, Eden discovers that something is different about her family and the mystery surrounding her life becomes her new quest as she tries to find out what secrets lie in the past. This was an excellent story and the author has a remarkable talent. I hope to see more of her works published in the future.	2004-04-29

He moved back and forth between his crazy mother and her demented psychiatrist. He tells about his life beginning about age 11, often with raunchy details and disturbing events that make you wonder what's really happening behind the closed doors of your own neighbors. Nothing is as it appears. This book was fast-paced and kept my attention throughout as I continued to wonder how a boy growing up in this environment could later evolve into a man capable of writing such an entertaining piece of work. I was disappointed in the ending though, as it only left me still wondering. It seemed very abrupt. Maybe there will be a sequel?	2004-04-29

Campbell Jr., who happens to live in Germany during the Nazi regime. He is confronted by the Americans to work as a spy, sending secret messages through a radio broadcast. He agrees to this but at the same time his broadcasts are filled with propaganda, all in favor of Hitler and his actions. True to Vonnegut's style, the plot gets more and more twisted as the story goes on, ending with Campbell in an Israeli prison. This was a wonderfully well written novel with action and intrigue that made it hard to put down! Each time I finish one of Vonnegut's novels, I find myself longing to head back to the library to find another one.	2004-04-29

This novel starts out explaining how Winston Niles Rumfoord, obviously a wealthy man, has been caught in a &quot;chronosynclastic infundibulum&quot; while traveling in his private space ship with man's best friend, his dog Kazak. &quot;Chronosynclastic infundibulum&quot; is explained as &quot;being those places...where all the different kinds of truths fit together.&quot; Not a very helpful definition, but the reader will develop his own sense of the meaning behind this phrase while reading about the lives of Malachi Constant and Beatrice Rumfoord, discovering the way Winston Rumfoord orchestrates their lives. Their future has been predicted by Winston Rumfoord and despite their own desires to thwart this prediction, they are warned that nothing they can do will stop it from happening. I'm not a fan of science fiction but this book was amazing! The ending caught me by surprise and I was pleasantly intrigued throughout by the interesting web of events Vonnegut created.	2004-04-29

The premise: Kurt Vonnegut is playing the part of a radio talkshow host who allows Dr. Kevorkian to &quot;kill&quot; him so that he (Kurt) may go to heaven and interview various people before they enter the pearly gates. After obtaining his interview, he is revived by Dr. Kevorkian so that he may report his findings on the air. He does this over 100 times, until Saint Peter tells him that if he arrives again, then he will have to stay; along with the complications of Dr. Kevorkian's trial for murder in MI. The interviews include short conversations with Sir Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare and Martin Luther King's assassin. An entertaining quick read!	2004-04-29

The book is written as if the reader were inside Will's head, thus the style of writing can seem a bit disjointed and distracting at first as Will's thoughts tend to ramble and roam. Once adjusting to this style, the situations these two young men find themselves in are hilarious. I especially enjoyed the author's additions of pictures throughout the book, tying them in with the actual story.<br />I found that the biggest problem with this story was a section of 50 pages titled, Interruption by Hand. This section is placed in the middle of the story, but what the reader learns reading these pages drastically changes the view of the story. Upon finishing Hand's thoughts, I was no longer interested in the rest of the book. I was so disappointed in the last 100 pages that I would recommend skipping the Interruption by Hand and leaving that section to read last, despite the author's insistence that it be in the middle, thus making the ending more climactic.	2004-04-29

It is 1970 and all is quiet until a local woman is raped and murdered. Now a trial is set to begin with a member of the notorious Padgitt family. The jurors are selected, one of them being the first black female to serve and also a dear friend of Mr. Traynor. The trial is heavily covered in the paper, increasing the sales to Willie's delight. When the convicted, Danny Padgitt, is senctenced to life in prison, the town relaxes...except for those that understand that a life sentence doesn't necessarily mean he will remain in prison for life.1 Tension mounts years later when he is released on parole and deaths occurr once again in the town.<br />Mr. Grisham is back to writing about the courts and laws, the things I love to read by him. But this book doesn't stick to just the courts. It's more of a mixture between his action packed earlier books (such as The Firm) and his later, low-keyed home town books (such as A Painted House). He spends a great amount of time exploring the lives of various characters, sometimes giving more detail than needed. I found myself becoming bored in spots, wishing for more excitement with Danny Padgitt.	2004-04-29

I picked it up at the library solely because of the beautiful front cover. It was intriguing to read; containing all the qualities of an American mystery but filled with numerous interesting facts concerning the Japanese culture. I found myself learning as well as being entertained by the story. My only true disappointment was discovering, after I started reading, that this book is the 9th in a series. I'm positive that I would have enjoyed the storyline more if I had read the other 8 books as much of the character background left me confused. There were often remarks concerning events in the previous books, sure to make a less observant reader wonder if they had skipped some pages. However, I do intend to look for the previous books as I found the characters intriguing, the plot filled with twists and turns, and overall, the entire book was very enjoyable. Many times, I was fooled, thinking I had figured out the mystery until finally the truth was revealed in the end. One word of warning, there are several very graphic sexual scenes. I would not recommend this to a younger reader; definitely intended for the adult audience.	2004-04-29

There are no courtroom dramas. Gone is the suspense that you can usually expect when picking up a Grisham novel. In this book former football players come together in a small town to await the inevitable death of their former coach, a man who was loved and hated. They wait in the bleachers, discussing their triumphs and their sorrows that were shared with every member of the town each time the team hit the field. They console each other in an effort to forgive the past mistakes and move on to the future. Although this book was well written, it would have been more meaningful if I were a sports fan. It was a very short book and for that, I was grateful. Grisham is an excellent author, making it possible for me to even finish the book; but I hope that he returns to the courtroom in his next venture.	2004-04-29

I had a hard time trying to decide what to write for the review of this book. When I first started reading it, I was not impressed with the author's style of writing. It was hard for me to follow the time line of events and feel sympathy for the main character, Dolores Price. As the story went on, I began to get used to the author's style of writing, then I found myself very angry with Dolores and the decisions she made. Upon further speculation, I wondered, maybe her decisions affected me so much because I could relate to her in so many ways. I wanted to reach into the story, take Dolores and just shake her up, yell at her or somehow make her understand that she wasn't alone, that she had other choices she could make. By the end, I couldn't put the book down; I was so involved in the story and hoping that Dolores would find happiness.	2004-04-29

It took some patience in the beginning; but with such an acclaimed author, I had to keep reading and was well rewarded in the end. This book has everything : humor, love, mystery, sci-fi, and religion. The protagonist of the story starts out on a mission to write a book about the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Japan and the father of the atomic bomb, Dr. Hoenikker. He becomes completely immersed in the lives of the Hoenikker family and joins a religious cult, whose fundamental beliefs are based on lies. Vonnegut is so obscure; thus rather than clearly stating facts, many important points of this story are magically dispersed throughout the background. Despite the fantastic chain of events that lead to the conclusion of this tale, Vonnegut's insightful revelations concerning the nature of humanity may be enough to convince the reader that quite possibly fate has already determined the destiny of the world. Well done.	2004-04-29

After an attempt of suicide, she is placed in a hospital where she is isolated from the norms of society. While there, she learns that she does indeed have inner strengths and the ability to cope. She emerges from the hospital ready to face the world head on.<br />This book brings even more meaning with the knowledge that the author, Sylvia Plath, dealt with many of the same issues in her own life. It has been speculated that she wrote this book more as an autobiography rather than a work of fiction because of the many similarities. But tragically, rather than gaining courage and strength, Sylvia Plath committed suicide not long after this book was published.

It has a good story premise but it doesn't really go anywhere. The basics of this story: Vonnegut depicts America as a land run by machines. All the humans must have a doctorate in order to be considered qualified for any jobs because machines have been built that efficiently replace lower workers. There is very little mention of children, but the few that are brought up merely point out the struggles of trying to pass tests for degrees and then fighting 500 others for the one job opening available. The protagonist, Dr. Paul Proteus, gets fed up with his machine dominated environment but doesn't have the will to commit himself to opposition until he is forced into it. There is a second story line with a diplomat from another country touring America as his host tries to convince him of the need to replace humans with machines in his own country. The host fails in his mission as things fall apart in the end.<br />Basically, I thought there were too many strings left hanging in this book. Vonnegut would start off on a tangent, with such extreme description, but then there was no real resolution. Like, what happened to the farm? I was especially disappointed in the ending, expecting more out of Dr. Proteus than was given. So many things were left unexplained that I felt like I was wasting my time reading this book. I would become interested in one aspect only to find myself filled with more questions left unanswered.	2004-04-29

Literally, in English, it means Main Camp Administration but on a broader scale Gulag became known as the Soviet sytems of slave labor, referring to all of their camps, from concentration camps to punishment camps and even children's camps. Ms. Applebaum makes a very good point in her introduction, as she explains that \\"to many people, the crimes of Stalin do not inspire the same visceral reaction as the crimes of Hitler\\" despite the fact that during the years of Stalin's reign, millions more suffered than the numbers killed by the German concentration camps. Every once in a while, I find myself drawn to a nonfiction book and this one caught my attention and held it from beginning to end as I learned about the atrocities that affected nearly every Russian living during this time period. If they were not personally enslaved in one of the work camps, they knew someone who had been. People were arrested for the most minor crimes and offenses in order to fill the camps with working bodies to maintain the high level of production demanded by their superiors. Those imprisoned suffered from starvation and exhaustion to the point where many reports of self-mutilation were recorded in an effort to earn themselves a vacation in the camp hospital, where rest and higher rations of food were available. There is so much information in this book I can hardly imagine the amount of time involved in preparing it. I was very impressed not only with Ms. Applebaum's knowledge but also her ability to portray many different aspects of the camps, giving the reader an inside look at a system that should only exist on paper.	2004-04-29
