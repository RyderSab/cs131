This is a good book  because for once you get there point of view but if all the books had team rockets  point of view this would not be 5 star material. It's 5 star material because it's different, not just the same old thing. The story itself is not that good, but it's still good  enough for a score of 50 out of 10. 49 of those points were for being different. 1 was for the story.	2001-11-21
