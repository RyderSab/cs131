There are blind dates, personal ads, old school friends, singles dinners, agencies and holidays to be tried and tested to sniff out the right bloke.<br />Although this story does have some quite funny scenes, it was not terribly interesting for me.  Every time I picked the book back up, I had to try and figure which man she was talking about.  Unfortunately it was a case of too many men with forgettable inadequacies.  <br />I also tired of the naive nature of the main character, Tiffany.

The naiviety when it came to boys, the struggles trying to individualise the school uniform, the feeling that your parents are from another planet....<br />Georgia Nicholson had me laughing out loud many times during the book.  There were so many things that were funny- her cat, her lesson in snogging, her attempt at peroxiding her hair so she could casually flick it out of her eyes, only to have the whole clump fall off in her hand!  <br />The day when her class had an emergency teacher and everytime the teacher turned to write something on the board they would all silently shift their tables back a few inches until they were all cramped up the back of the room bought back so many similar memories for me!<br />I highly recommended this book to anyone who needs a lift, for anyone who needs to have a bit of a laugh or giggle.	2001-09-26

Here in this town they don't know that she was overweight, they don't know that she hasn't many friends, and without this baggage she begins to see herself in a different light, reflected in the people around her.<br />Sure there are hiccups along the way, but ultimately Colie begins to see that she is a worthwhile and normal person, she learns to see people as who they are, not what they are.<br />Sarah Dessen has done a good job of capturing the angst of a teenager who doesn't know her place in the scheme of things and learns to accept and even like herself, without getting too mushy.

She lives with her busy mother, who leaves her notes for her on the fridge with helpful tips on how to cook their dinner, asks for her ideas regarding marketing items at the advertising agency for which she works. Her father has just announced that he will be spending a year in Australia, so that means being bounced to and fro between her parents.

She is herself, through and through.   She wears pioneer type dresses, no make up, meditates, knows peoples birthdays, makes people feel good about themselves.<br />At the start the majority of the school applauds her individuality and even flatters her when they copy her odd ways.  But slowly they see her individuality as a hindrance and begin to turn on her.  Leo, the 16 year old narrator of the book finds himself as her boyfriend, and as such is completely alienated from the rest of the school.  It dawns on him that he has to choose, Stargirl or his friends and respect. <br />This is probably one of the best books I have read for an awful long time, and I read a lot of books!

I didn't really understand the grandmother Clione, and her relationship with Grace, and the two of them as young women, sometimes their stories sounded so alike that I had trouble distinguishing who was who.<br />I thought the real talent of the story was the story of Grainne, misplaced and orphaned by her mother's death.  I was touched by her feelings of loneliness and her attempts to reach out to her mother's boyfriend.  After her mother's death she is surprised to hear that she does indeed have a family in Ireland, a grandmother, relatives and even a father.  A father who is scared to see her.  The scene in which they finally meet up is wonderful and probably the best part of the story.<br />The descriptions of Ireland and the little island all sound wonderful and you can almost hear the lilt of the voices.

Even though Ave Maria feels she is the town spinster, it is also a year of marriage proposals, one she thought she wanted, and one she didn't expect.<br />I got a nice sense of place with this story, with the closeness of the community, the gossips and the characters of the town.  Jac Mac wasn't particularly well 'fleshed out' for me though, it seemed a little like, because all the characters said he was nice and a catch etc, that I had to take their word for it, instead of feeling it through the writing myself.	2001-05-20

I read the edition that had a picture of the interior of a car door, and I expected a 'travelling' novel.<br />Instead I got a story of an uncomfortable relationship of a mother and daughter, stuck in the heat of summer in a small town.  Daughter Amy is in need of affection and sets her sights on her math teacher who makes her feel special.  Mother Isabelle is a nervy quiet woman, trying to fit into a small community without the locals discovering her past.<br />There are many sad and awkward moments in this book, as the community begin to learn more of Amy and Isabelle and their lives, good and bad.<br />All in all it is an interesting read of a dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship interspersed with other town characters, some well written, others a little one dimensional.	2001-03-29

This book came to me with rave reviews from my sister in law.  A book is always diappointing when you are expecting it to be better than it actually is.<br />It's a story of Alexandra and Eric who meet when he is hired as her model for an illustrative journal.  He is formulative gorgeous, of course, and she is taken with him. Quickly they fall in love and move in together, forsaking all others.<br />Basically the first part of the book is all about their love affair, and the latter is about him dealing with AIDS and Alex's commitment to him.  <br />It is a sweet, teary sort of story which does it's job, reminding all us fortunate healthy people not to take ourselves or each other for granted.  I found it a bit too soap-operatic though, full of so much drama that it all became unbelievable and schmaltzy towards the end.	2001-03-23

Still enjoyed it as a stand alone book however.	2001-03-23

She is on the cusp of adulthood and feels her parents treat her more as a child than adult.<br />These are the three uniquely different voices which l came to love throughout this book, reading of their past, their present and what the future held for them.

There are the Old McPheron brothers who have lived together so long they have no need for words, until a young pregnant school girl has nowhere to go and no one to turn to.<br />The dialogue is simple, often charming and even heart breaking as all these characters shuffle along and try to find their way in life.

Lewis Little is growing up, sometimes faltering between becoming a man and sliding back into childhood with its securities.  <br />The first part of the book details his attachment to the author of romance novels, with whom he and his mother are staying.  Just when you think that the novel is about his love for an older woman, and an interesting coming of age story, suddenly the object of his affections disappears.<br />He decides to take on the responsibility of finding and rescuing her.<br />I found this book really interesting and was fascinated by the world through Lewis' eyes.  He was funny, sweet, heroic, emotional, embarrassing...everything that we all experience during puberty.  I have two more of Rose Tremain's books on my shelf and look forward to reading them.	2000-12-02

While they are decomposing amongst the dunes we learn of what their lives were like, earlier that day and earlier in their life when they just met.  <br />I found this book to be totally engrossing and touching in many ways.  However, I didn't find that I 'bonded' with any character to really draw me into the book.  An earlier reviewer stated that you should read this alone, and I add that you shouldn't read it over lunch either, if you are squeamish.	2000-12-02

But it wasn't always that way.  She has fond memories of meeting and marrying Charlo Spencer, the man of her dreams.  However, she also has memories of him beating her until he exhausted himself, raping her, waking her up with a boot to the stomach.<br />Paula lived with this man, trapped by her poverty, her lack of self worth, her despair and fear.  She feels that Charlo is the only man or person who sees her when she feels invisible.  She becomes an alcohlic.<br />It's only when Charlo stares at his daughter with hate filled eyes that Paula realises that she must stop him.  She has to break the cycle in order to protect her children as best as she can.<br />Roddy Doyle has written a painful and graphically real story with an amazing lead character.  I really felt for her when Charlo would escort her to the hospital after a beating and she would silently plead with the doctors or nurses to ask how the injury happened.  Instead all they saw was a drunk who kept falling down stairs and walking into doors.	2000-10-26

From Lucy we get the emotional pain of the waiting to get pregnant and the grief each month when it doesn't happen.<br />This book isn't only about babies, it's also about relationships and how sometimes we take each other for granted, or become selfish in our needs.

The story begins with Ginny, who is 47 years old and is flying to visit her mother, who she hasn't seen for 35 years.  My first thoughts were, 'how  could you not see your mother for that long?'  <br />But as the story unfolds,  detailed in flashbacks, I began to empathise with Ginny and her sister  Sharla.  It becomes quite clear how they found it easier not to have  contact with their mother.  Their mother did walk out and leave them,  afterall.<br />Their mother began to regret her life, and the predictability  of it.  She felt like she hadn't lived to her true potential, and she had  to find that away from her family.<br />So she sacrificed her children for her  own shot of life.<br />I understand to a point how a mother would WANT to  leave her children, especially when suffering from depression, but I don't  understand how she COULD.  I know I couldn't step more than three feet from  my front door before I'd turn around again.  <br />It's a fine line being a  mother, a wife and a person with needs. All us mothers walk that line  everyday, and I think it's important to realise that our mothers did too,  as did theirs, without the options we have today, like childcare, part time  jobs etc.  These girls found out that it's a luxury to take mothers for  granted.	2000-08-31

First it was found in her breast, then her lungs, then her bones and her brain.  This brave story is  about the courage of friends and how to assist someone you love, prepare to  leave you.<br />Ruth gathers her friends about her, friends that leap off the  page with their emotions and coping levels.  I admired these women for  their courage, for their ability to say the words that need to be said, to  be able to drive their friend to cemetaries to pick the right one, without  falling apart.<br />This book is beautifully written, so tender it had me in  tears for so many of the pages, and for a long time after.  Little innocent  things like Ann looking at her daughter's shoes and realising that Ruth had  helped pick them out with her, and she wouldn't be able to do that anymore.   How huge the car felt after she dropped Ruth off at the airport.<br />A truly  beautiful book about girl friends, how they support each other and how they  can be jealous of each other.  I recommend also reading &quot;The Saving  Graces&quot; by Patrical Gaffney, and &quot;What Girls Learn&quot; by Karin  Cook, which are both very memorable also.	2000-08-31

She wants to promise him the world, share his dreams, be his  everything.<br />Unfortunately for Katie, as the story unfolds, Jimmy is  hopelessly in love with his wife, would do anything for her and that  involves moving away, to be closer to her family.

However, nothing prepared him for what his life and his family's  would be like there.  It's told in 5 different voices, the daughters and  his wife's, and it was really interesting to get alternative views from  them.<br />But ultimately I didn't get captured by this book or dislike Nathan  as intensely as the father in The Mosquito Coast.<br />There are some touching  images in this book, the first page of the mother describing the jungle is  perfect, as is the 'laying out' of one of her daughters, which is  devestatingly heartbreaking.

Simply Griet  needed an exit, and there was only one logical answer.  <br />I loved the  descriptions of the paintings, and found myself turning back to the front  cover of the book and studying it, time and time again.	2000-08-25

So when her body starts falling apart  from the stress of her lifestyle, and she must take leave from her job, it  comes as a shock to her to allow herself to feel emotions.  Her past  bubbles up and demands closure before she can continue into the  future.<br />This book superbly displays some fantastic characterisations, and  I felt it read more like snippets of personalities, especially the small  town characters, rather than a continuous story.

I  really enjoyed his efforts to bring the characters to life.<br />This is a  touching story of a 'no strings attached' cool dude of a man named Will,  who finds himself beginning to care about the people around him.  There's  Marcus, a 12 year old geek who is being bullied at school and his mother  Fiona, who in a fit of depression attempts suicide.<br />Poor awkward Marcus  needs Will's help to become 'cool' which Will excels at.  Infact, that  seems to be all that he's good at.  He's so shallow that he thinks it's a  good idea to invent a child as a reason to go to Single Parent meetings to  pick up women.<br />Fortunately as the story speeds along Will takes a good  hard look at himself and realises that he needn't be as empty as his image  projects, and Marcus' finds unlikely friends and allies to support him  through the tough and awkward times as puberty sets in.  This was quite an  enjoyable story to listen to while driving to and from work.	2000-08-10

I was glad when Paul returned to the story as I liked  his character.<br />This story just seemed a little too long for me, it could  have easily been 50 pages shorter and arrived at the same conclusions.

Josephine leaps right off the pages as does Jacob, her parents and her  friends.  I have seen the movie, which l also enjoyed and knew what was  about to happen, but still it had me in tears.  <br />I was so happy for her  when her father walked beside her at her school and she felt like  &quot;Wow, so this is how it feels to have a father&quot;.  <br />This girl  really grows up during the book, and I hope the author gets around to  writing more fantastic fiction.	2000-07-29

Unfortunately, despite how much she is loved and belongs to and at  Wideacre, it can never be hers, because she is a woman.  <br />She decides to  make it hers, no matter the cost.  She plays all the other characters in  the book against each other, seeing them only as how they can serve her  purpose.  Through the book she changes Wideacre and the people that inhabit  it, for the worse, but can see no other way.  And when victory comes, it is  very shallow indeed.<br />Beatrice is not a nice person.  But she is a  powerful and passionate woman who refuses to obey anyone but her dreams,  and l admire her for that.  I had to laugh when an earlier reviewer stated  that Beatrice was despicable and only finished the book to see if she got  her &quot;comeuppance&quot;.  The books is over 600 pages, so it's an awful  long wait!  Another good recommendation  is Philippa Gregory's &quot;Wise  Woman&quot;.	2000-07-29

Despite the necessity, I still found the  transcript quite boring, and it was only in retrospect that I began to  believe Lizzie's emotions at the end of the story.  &quot;Mapping the  Edge&quot; is a much better book from this author.	2000-07-13

US	50658536	R10ZZ8W6T2OVU2	0380796090	962133592	Watermelon	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Great Fun!	This books is so much fun!

Claire goes home to her  family to fall apart, which she accomplishes successfully and then, with  help, to put herself back together.

All the parts to do with her pregnancy and the loss touched my heart.  I liked the reversal of roles when they went to Spain, when they relied on her to keep them fed etc.  I  liked the chapters from the three children's point of view, felt them  materialise out of the lumps of clay they had begun to assume.  <br />But the  style of the book, while lyrical and thoughtful, also was slightly bland  (for want of a better term). It just seemed too calm when I was  anticipating a storm.	2000-02-06

An engrossing story of a woman who comes to work in a cute little Scottish town, with all its characters. She is on a 'dig' and finds a lot more than she bargains for.....a ghost on good terms with the neighbour's dog, a little boy with a special gift and a hunk of a man who is affectionaly known as Mr Deid-banes! Very sweet and I look forward to reading more of this author!	2000-02-06
US	50658536	R1H030OU6WWY3B	067179275X	559607872	The Wise Woman	Books	5	29	31	N	N	not so smart for a wise woman	This is a brilliant dark story of a young girl and her quest to live like a queen.  She wants the prize of 'lady of the house' and will stop at nothing to get it.  She uses her power to reach for her dreams, only to  realise that the prize wasn't hers.  She is a false woman, and slowly  becomes entrapped in her own lies.<br />Despite the bleakness of the story and  the wickedness of Alys, I still liked her!  She felt she was destined for  an important role, and went out to claim it.  She sought love and didn't  know what to do with it when she had it.  As l was approaching the last few  pages of the story I was wondering how on earth it could end, I was so  looking forward to the birth of her child etc.  <br />I am currently making my  way through all of Philippa Gregory's books.  Her novels, both historical  and comtemporay are always so vivid and the endings never fail to be  anything but thought provoking.  Keep writing, because l will certainly  keep reading!	2000-01-23

Naturally enough the only times I could find to read this one, were at night, husband asleep, the kids in bed, the wind blowing outside, and  bringing with it the odd noises...<br />I ended up finding time to read it  during the day, so I could concentrate on sleeping at night, rather than  wondering what those 'creaks' and 'thumpings' were!	2000-01-13

And this is the one that I like the least.  Unlike House of Echoes, this did not scare me, and unlike Lady of Hay and Child of the Phoenix, this book did not  transport me to another time and place.  <br />I can't place my finger on what  it was, but the story just seemed a little flat.  Maybe there were too many  characters and they were fairly bland and cliched.  I didn't understand  which of the two male leads I was meant to like, and decided on Greg who  was fleshed out better than Jon.  <br />It was still an interesting story and  it won't disuade me from reading more from this author.	2000-01-13
US	50658536	RWE7VDTYH5ZA4	0345382846	905379525	Here Be Dragons	Books	5	2	2	N	N	brilliant!	This is just a brilliant book.  From the title's meaning all the way through to the end.  I had misgivings about liking the female lead, Joanna, after reading Barbara' Erskine's fantastic &quot;Child of the  Phoenix&quot;, where Joanna is the cold, distant mother of Eleyne, who  narrates that story.  <br />However, I think it made me enjoy it more.  I  loved Llewelyn and his friends, despised King John,laughed and cried  through the pages.  I look forward to the remainder of the trilogy!  I also  agree with the previous reviewer, go and get Diana Gabaldon's books!	2000-01-13
US	50658536	R2K5DRIGWDVRFJ	0553108441	390189923	Ferney	Books	4	2	2	N	N	stuck in my imagination	Wow!  This is a beautiful novel that ended way too quickly!  It has a fantastic sense of scenery and historical detail.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because, like another reviewer, I didn't feel the  passion between Gally and Ferney.  It was written, but it didn't carry  across to me.  I would also loved to have read more about Gally's lives,  including the missing years in which she can't remember.  I loved the  ending, even though I could predict it, and will no doubt spend time  wondering what Gally would have done next.  But all in all, a great read,  and I look forward to reading more from this author.	2000-01-04

Had a fantastic easy style and really enjoyed the characters, especially Duck.  However I had one small problem with it, a bit like the lead's  characters memory of the world, when I put the book down it suddenly didn't  seem as important, and I found it hard to remember what exactly I was up  to!  Maybe it was due to the holiday haze style that it was written in.   Enjoyed the ending.	1999-12-27

Truth be known, I borrowed this book becase I liked the front cover.  I expected a family saga, with sorrows and joys, but only found sorrows.  To me it felt like there wasn't  any drama, that the farm theme took all that away.  Eg: shelled peas,  snapped off some broccoli, decided to kill my sister, swept the  floors...... etc etc.  Basically quite a saga with not too many nice people  and not too many see it to the end.	1999-12-09
US	50658536	R1DDXGZXJRY8SJ	0006499708	988006454	A RESPECTABLE TRADE.	Books	4	8	9	N	N	interesting story of a horrible crime	This is a story of the times when slave trading was not illegal in Britain.  The new wife of a slave trader finds herself with the job of training slaves to sell to the gentry to make a profit.  She is down  trodden and powerless, and is slowly drawn to one of the slaves with whom  she falls in love with. <br />Philippa Gregory writes well, her novels finish  tidily and are written with humour. I always like the characters I'm meant  to like, dislike the baddies and feel content with the outcome. However,  with this book, I could only see the love one way, the slave had contempt  for his owner, and then suddenly he was in love with her.  Still, an  interesting book on a horrendous time in history	1999-12-02

Once I got to the second part, however I was involved with the storyline and it all started to intertwine  and become very interesting.  A good read, but not a book to read in little  spurts, go and hide yourself for a couple of hours here and there and lose  yourself in another century.	1999-12-02
