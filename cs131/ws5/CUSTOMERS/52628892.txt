This game is exceptionally diverting for boring car trips and waiting time for medical appointments.  The kindergarten game does seem more appropriate for 4 year olds rather than 5-6 year olds if the child has had a lot of exposure to letters, colors, shapes etc.  There are a few dreadful lapses in accuracy, among the worst being the placement of a penguin next to an Eskimo and igloo. The Eskimo/igloo cliche is annoying, but the transposition of that poor little penguin from Antarctica is inexcusable. Our pre-schooler concluded the penguin must be just visiting.	2002-05-15

As soon as this author revealed that she thought creationism was science, I knew I would have trouble with this book.  In spite of some quite helpful information for beginning homeschoolers, I found myself feeling leary of her curriculum references.  Anybody who raves about curriculum materials put out by Bob Jones University is automatically a bit suspect. I kept encountering  statements such as &quot;I have not found any positions that conflict with our (Christian) beliefs.&quot; Was this the royal &quot;our&quot;?  As a Christian of a different persuasion, I found such remarks out-of-place and presumptuous. If you dislike religious indoctrination you would likely find a different homeschooling book to be more helpful and certainly less annoying.	2002-04-24

Unfortunately, the beginning phrase &quot;Over in the grasslands&quot; has the right number of sylables, but causes the tongue to stumble over the next line when singing aloud.  Worse, the clever premise of setting the story in Africa, is not very well executed.  The toads appear to be frogs on lily pads, the monkeys look like chimps to me, and the eagle looks suspiciously like an American bald eagle.  Do warthogs go &quot;Oink&quot;? Just in case you think I am being picky, the above possible errors were pointed out by my 2 and a half year old grandson whose mom just happens to be a biology teacher.  While I didn't expect a science book, I do wish a little more care had been given to choosing animals that were exclusively African and protraying them a little more thoughtfully.	2001-01-09

Two grouchy old mice live in an ancient shell of an abandoned car. The illustrations are top-notch and our 3 year old grandson loves talking about them. The story is all right, though the plot is not strong. The verse is grating because of the constant use of the word &quot;mousery&quot; to rhyme with itself. After the 4th time this happened in just a few pages, grandpa handed the book to grandma and said, &quot;You finish reading it to him, I can't stand any more.&quot; Only Great Aunt Nina really loves the verse and thinks the rhymes are just so sweet. The three year old likes the book, but it is not a favorite. He was through with it after just a few readings.  Books he LOVES, such as The Color Kittens and Runaway Bunny (both by Margaret Wise Brown)he wants over and over and can recite by heart.	2000-12-17

I have checked out all seven versions of Three Billy Goats Grufff available from our library just to see which was best for a three year old.  This one  by Stephen Carpenter has large, clever, uncluttered pictures and tells the  story in simple language. The troll is not too scary and, all in all, this  one seems just right for little ones.   Another version, the elaborately  illustrated one by Janet Stevens, uses a colorful, imaginative vocabulary  and would have more appeal to adults and older children (5 or 6 and up?).	2000-03-29

This small book is part of a group of Find the Animal books.  Our 16 month old really enjoyed Find the Kitten, so we bought several others in the series. The books are so well-make and inexpensive that they are really  quite bargains. This one is especially appropriate for toddlers who can't  talk much but love to point when a parent says, &quot;Where IS that duck,  anyway?&quot; It is really nice if your little one has a yellow rubber  duck.

This book is very good because I get to point, clap and meow a lot. My grandma always laughs and acts surprised when I find the kitten, but I don't know why, because it really wasn't so very hard after the first time. Since there aren't any words, we get to talk about the cute pictures.  I  call the cat Edgar because that is my cat's name. We had so much fun  Grandma bought me four more books in the series.

It's not a board book, there are no talking animals, no push or pull gimicks. Just a simple picture story (no words)with three characters, a toddler whose socks are in  a continual state of coming off, his cat, and a father who is trying to  sleep.  Beautiful, expressive pictures lead a parent to talk with a little  one about what is happening.  This is our 19 month old's favorite book, and  has been for over two months! Even better than his Spot books and Find the  Kitten. If the library didn't let us recheck it over and over I'm sure he  would feel a great loss.  May it come back soon.	2000-03-26

This can turn into one noisy book, what with splattering rain, whooshing wind, and squishing mud. The pictures are hilarious and such a welcome relief from the cutesy yellow fuzzy ducks commonly encountered.  It is  Grandma's favorite car read-aloud.

This outstanding book for parents and caregivers of two year olds is the third in a series. It offers activities that promote total child development, including physical, mental, and the creative aspects of  learning. The organization into easily located categories makes it easy to  quickly locate an appropriate activity. As a grandparent-caregiver who used  the books for Baby and One-year olds, I am pleased to find that the  activities are just as well thought-out and age appropriate in this book as  in the other two. The instructions are very clear and there are enough  activities that even if only half of them were tried you would never run  out of interesting things to do.	2000-03-25

I was so tired of childrens books about cute bears and even more tired of sappy Christmas fantasy tales that I almost didn't even look at this one. However, the storyline is clever and the plot(Yes, it has one)has several  interesting twists. The pictures are endearing and lovely. Yes, grandma did  indeed buy one more bear-Christmas-fantasy book, and her grandson loves it  dearly.

Grandma dug out the old dog-eared copy of this book for the 12 month old grandson. Now he is 18 months and we are very relieved to find that it is still in print, because the old one has finally been loved to pieces. The  book doesn't look especially unusual, just a bunch of cute monkeys, but the  rhythms are fantastic. It doesn't have flaps, or textures, or bright  colors, but this was the first book he would really listen to and he still  wants it read to him daily. He has many books that he loves to look at, but  this is the best one for listening. The old book isn't a board book and we  will replace it with the same size book. We are finding that often the  board book pictures lose impact because of the reduced size.	2000-03-05

By telling about love from the points of view of different animals, this book manages to be warm and comforting and at the same time stretches the imaginations of young children. The pictures are beautiful enough for a  child to look at alone, but the book begs to be read aloud. It is a great  bedtime book, especially when a toddler's life has been just a bit too  hectic or challeging that day.	2000-02-27

At 15 months our little one started looking for kitty on every page and continues to choose the book at every opportunity. Now, three months later  he is Talking obout just where the kitty is. This little book is terrific  because it allows interaction at several levels of baby development. What a  bargain.  I am going to get at least three more in the series.

As a science teacher it is horrifying to me that anyone is being required to read this self-serving piece of fiction for a science class. (Unless perhaps as a negative example of deplorable ethics.) Watson's account of the discovery of the structure of the DNA helix is so fraught with  falsehoods that it could at best only be called historical fiction.  His  need to vilify and degrade Rosalind Franklin (whose essential (and stolen)  work he used) can hardly be something that is admirable.  For a factual  account of events read Rosalind Franklin &amp; DNA by Anne Sayre instead.  No, it will not be an easy read, but you will certainly get a different  view and it is backed up with facts and dates.	2000-01-09

This teaching family, six educators, grades K-16, (plus 3 degrees in psychology) agrees that this book is indeed a shift in thinking and one that finally faces up to some important truths. Those psychologists who are  crying foul and using their lofty psychobabble to discredit this work  likely have not observed first hand the long-range development of student  behavior, or perhaps they just have too great a stake in their own precious  (and hard-learned) notions.  Granted, the author goes a bit overboard in  discounting the parental influence quite so completely, but one doesn't  have to accept every word to recognize the kernal of truth present in the  basic premise. In our over 100 years of collective teaching we have watched  students change completely according to the peer group they were with at  the time. (Classroom Angel to Neighborhood Terror) (Elementary School Honor  Student turning into a Middle School Dropout)  It is quite hard to accept  that as parents we have only a certain amount of influence, but there it  is. Teachers, counselors, and parents could all benefit from giving the  ideas in this book careful consideration.	1999-09-10

Having four grown children, I was looking for a book for my daughter who will soon give birth to her first child.  How delightful to find a book that not only understands fussy babies but has so many practical solutions to colic and many other common problems.<br />On the other hand, how too bad that Dr. Sears notions about working moms are so far removed from reality.  Wear your baby to work indeed! (think flight attendant, chemistry teacher, policewoman, waitress, judge) Not one job in a thousand is geared to make this even feasible. In third world countries perhaps, but not on Main street, or Wall street.<br />  As for the family bed - well THAT sure would help insure that this was an only child, probably through divorce.  Parents have little enough private time if they both work without having one or several children sleeping with them for years.<br />  From their exalted income level the Sears really have no comprehension of the financial situation of most American families! .  Nor do they apparently grasp that a working mother would drop dead from exhaustion trying to be the kind of mother they hold up as the ideal model. <br />Dr Sears claims that he isn't trying to lay a guilt trip on anyone and then proceeds to do just that. In addition, he cites only those studies that support his own prejudices, of which he has quite a few.<br />  I wouldn't dream of actually giving this book to my daughter who MUST return to work when her baby is three months old.  I know from experience that it is possible for her to be an absolutely terrific mom without becoming her child's slave.  I will happily pass on to her the book's wonderful wisdom, but she really can do without the preaching.<br />Oh yes, Dr Sears contends you can't spoil a baby by giving it too much attention.  As a 35 year verteran primary teacher I have seen all too many Smother Mothered babies who fully expect the world to contunue to cater to every whim just as Mommie did. Just because Dr. Sears didn!
