It doesn't come close to making its case. <br /> <br />I thought McGrath's previous book, \\"In the Beginning,\\" about the creation of the King James translation of the Bible, was well-written and nicely done, if not quite up to the intellectual heft of competing books on the same subject published around the same time.  But here he just falls on his face completely.  To give just the most risible example, he claims that one of the more convincing examples of the rise in religiosity can be found in the trend toward more spiritually minded episodes of \\"Star Trek.\\"  The rest of the book doesn't get more profound than that. <br /> <br />McGrath is a former atheist/Communist turned Protestant convert, which might help explain his \\"more Anglican than the Archbishop of Canterbury\\" attitude, but the fact is that not only does he fail to make his case, he doesn't even seem to realize that the data he employs to make his case (such as the fact that \\"liberal\\" Christian denominations are hemorrhaging members while the more mindless branches of Christianity are thriving) can be adduced to prove exactly the opposite contention - that what we're seeing today in the rise of brain-dead Evangelical Christianity is a case of Christianity running around like a chicken with its head cut off, and that it's the sign of a dead-end rather than a renewal.  I wouldn't presume to say that Christianity is on its way out (as Chou En-Lai once said about the French Revolution, it's too soon to tell), but the fact that Europe is now aggressively secular, while the Catholic Church among others is off desperately trolling for converts in the Third World, is not a particularly hopeful sign.  <br /> <br />If you'd like to read a book that makes the argument for the existence of a supreme being, and does it in a way that's far more cogent and intellectually respectable, I would suggest you try Hans Kung's \\"Does God Exist?,\\" which goes over much the same ground as this book and does it much better.  Unless you're prepared to be satisfied with very simplistic answers to very knotty questions, give this one a pass.  <br />	2004-11-16

Leslie Mitchell has set himself a daunting task in his new biography of Edward Bulwer Lytton.  First, as Mitchell points out early on in the text, while at one point in the Victorian era he vied with his fellow novelist Charles Dickens in popularity, since the end of the First World War he has been almost entirely forgotten - except to be ridiculed as the author of the worst sentence ever to open a novel: \\"It was a dark and stormy night\\" (which inspired the Bulwer Lytton Contest for bad writing, which Mitchell, tactfully, does not mention).  Secondly, Lytton was, to put it mildly, a very off-putting fellow, who might have been the most personally obnoxious author who ever lived (and try mulling over the implications of *that* statement for a second!).      It doesn't sound promising, does it?  A forgotten author who was a real jerk -- who's interested in reading about him?  But the fact is that Mitchell has done an admirable job of resurrecting this unsung writer and made him seem worth considering, even if you wouldn't want to sit next to him at a dinner party.    Of course, it helps that Lytton had one of the most famously catastrophic marriages in all of literary history - one that makes the Tolstoys and Fitzgeralds seem like Ozzie and Harriet by comparison.  The marriage of Edward Bulwer Lytton and his wife Rosina was a total nightmare.  At one point he had her committed to an insane asylum, and she retaliated by writing a series of abusive fictitious accounts of their marriage and humiliating him publicly whenever she got the opportunity.  It's pretty grim stuff but it makes for engrossing reading.    The only flaw with this biography is that it is not a straightforward narrative, as most biographies are, but a little more impressionistic.  Each chapter takes one aspect of Lytton's life and discusses it at length.  And while I might have preferred a more conventional approach, the method utilized by Mitchell does prove effective.  And putting all the information about Lytton's marriage, for example, in one chapter makes it even more harrowing (and entertaining - there's definitely a Merchant-Ivory film in that disastrous mesalliance).    Mitchell makes a token effort at making a case for Lytton as a novelist who can be appreciated today, but the fact is that it's hopeless: Lytton's prose style was so pretentious and convoluted that I very much doubt that he'll ever reach any type of popularity again (unlike his contemporary Anthony Trollope, who has seen an extraordinary renaissance of interest in his work in the past few decades).  So what you're left with is the very gaudy life of a man who destroyed nearly everything he touched, but whose very faults make him interesting.  So I can recommend this book, and if you go on from this to sample some of Lytton's fictional wares, well, you're a lot more adventurous than me.	2004-05-25

I have to admit to a certain bias here: I am a longtime Herman Wouk fan, so it comes as a delightful surprise to me that, as he nears his 90th birthday, he should come up with as sparkling an entertainment (in the Graham Greene sense of the word) as \\"A Hole in Texas.\\"  Wouk has to be the most underrated living American novelist, and when most of his contemporaries are six feet under, Wouk has written a very funny book that, while it has some continuity with his other books, is in a very real sense a delightful departure from what has gone before.    Guy Carpenter is a fiftysomething scientist who once worked on a large-scale government project in Texas looking for something called the Higgs boson.  After some years and a few billion dollars, Congress shut down the ambitious and expensive project, only to react with panic when it looks like the Chinese might have come discovered the Higgs boson on their own.      All of the arcane physics mumbo-jumbo is explained to the reader using the admirably clear dramatic exposition that Wouk has resorted to before (think of that amusingly improbable scene in \\"The Winds of War\\" when Byron Henry described to his new bride how a submarine works), and he makes the machinations of Congress seem utterly ridiculous - although admittedly that's not too hard to do.  There's a scene in a Bel-Air party where Dr. Carpenter and his wife are engulfed and almost swallowed alive by Hollywood types that might be the funniest thing Wouk has written since the seder scene in \\"Marjorie Morningstar.\\"  And Dr. Carpenter's problems with his wife - not to mention the complications of a sexy Congresswoman who used to be a movie star and a Chinese scientist who used to be his girlfriend - are made to seem both plausible and amusing.    Wouk's prose style is as clunky and Theodore Dreiser-ish as ever, and if he doesn't say, as Dreiser did, that \\"It was a truly swell saloon,\\" he does refer to a stripper as a \\"stripteaser,\\" which I doubt any male under eighty would ever do (at least not while sober).  But then Wouk is perhaps the only living author who is capable of using the word \\"monkeyshines\\" in a sentence with a straight face (as he did in his last nonfiction work, \\"The Will To Live On\\"), so I guess I shouldn't be surprised.    The bottom line is that at the age of 89, Herman Wouk is still in the game.  This is not a sweeping historical fiction like \\"The Winds of War\\" or \\"War and Remembrance,\\" but it's a lot of fun, and I enjoyed it immensely.  You will too.	2004-05-25

The freedom from the constraints of convention that these bohemians fought for was won at a price - and the price was usually poverty, disease and, more often than not, a squalid and disquieting end.  <br />Given the desperate nature of their lives, and their sometimes shocking deaths, the amazing thing is that the book is a fun read.  Nicholson is an engaging prose stylist who knows how to pluck out that little detail that will interest her reader.  It's not enough, for example, to point out that the artist Eric Gill engaged in incestuous relations with his daughters - he also refused to wear underwear.  Dylan Thomas preferred to steal shirts from friends and acquaintances rather than launder the ones he had.  The painter Augustus John leapt on just about every female in sight, and went about in his younger days like a bedraggled gypsy. <br />There are some omissions.  I would have liked Nicholson to have included George Gissing's &quot;The Private Papers of Henry Ryecroft,&quot; simply because it includes so much of the essence of what these people thought and felt, and not to mention Quentin Crisp, the author of &quot;The Naked Civil Servant,&quot; is a definite loss to the book.  <br />&quot;Among the Bohemians&quot; is a bit too British and Bloomsbury-centric (understandable enough, given that Nicholson's grandmother was Vanessa Bell and her great-aunt Virginia Woolf), and the Americans who came over to Europe between the wars are practically ignored, but given the limits of what she's chosen to work with, it's a splendid job. <br />Like it or not, though, we live in the world that the rebels that Nicholson describes brought about.  Our attitudes about just about everything are a lot more free-spirited and a lot less censorious than they would have been a century ago,and we owe those people who paid the price of their rebellion for the social freedoms that too many of us take for granted.  That's reason enough, I think, to read this book.	2004-05-25

In comparing the subject of his book to the Nobel Prize winning V.S. Naipaul, he mentions Paul Theroux's controversial memoir of Naipaul, &quot;Sir Vidia's Shadow.&quot;  He quotes the London Magazine's verdict on Theroux's spiteful book: &quot;I wonder if the author was conscious of how much he was giving away about himself?&quot; and then claims of it that &quot;It is so much more rich and fascinating than any conventional biography of Naipaul could have been.&quot;<br />And there you have it.  Lewis's book, which is obviously no &quot;conventional biography,&quot; is clearly intended by its author to be as &quot;rich and fascinating&quot; as &quot;Sir Vidia's Shadow,&quot; and as obviously an attack on its subject.  What is really is, regrettably, is a sordid exercise in perverse psychology - only the psychology on display is not that of the book's putative subject, but of its author.  <br />I've read dozens if not hundreds of biographies in the past 35 years or so, but I have never read one where the author had such obvious, odious and ill-concealed contempt for its subject than this one.  &quot;Lazy sod&quot; is just about the only epithet that Lewis affixes to Burgess that Amazon will allow me to print here (&quot;Burgess was not a generous man, financially, spiritually or morally&quot; is one of his kinder comments).  But open the book just about anywhere at random, and you are sure to spot some quotable calumny.  According to Lewis, Burgess is pretentious, callous, a phony, pathological, cheap and solipsistic - in short, an all around jerk.  He also claims, on the basis of a conveniently anonymous source, that Burgess didn't even write the book for which he is best known, &quot;A Clockwork Orange.&quot;<br />The trouble is, the more Lewis makes clear how much he despises Anthony Burgess, the more clearly you realize what a mini-masterpiece of projection this book really is.  The intention is to make the reader believe that Lewis is a far cleverer boy than Anthony Burgess ever was - and if that is its intention, the book must be considered a miserable failure.  For all his lust for invective, his superficial cleverness, and his near-total disdain for his subject, Roger Lewis has succeeded in demonstrating in his 396 pages of text (excluding appendices and index) only two things: that he loathes Anthony Burgess, and that he will never write a book as good as any of Burgess's works if he lives to be a thousand.  <br />Ironically, all his abuse of his subject has the reverse effect of the one intended - it makes you feel sympathy for the person being so endlessly (and pretentiously) abused.  If Anthony Burgess was a flawed human being, so what?  Many great writers are deeply flawed, even personally obnoxious, human beings.  That usually has little if nothing to do with their art.  And at least it can be said that Burgess spent his life devoted to literature, not squatting in his own bile, like his biographer.  If I were you, I would track down one of Anthony Burgess's novels (I would recommend the superb &quot;Earthly Powers&quot;) and leave this vicious little piece of tripe alone.	2004-05-18

Clarke has portrayed himself as the rootin' tootin' macho he-man who almost single-handedly kept the government from falling apart on September 11th.  I have to admit that I found this opening chapter a little offensive.  This tawdry reveling in unabashed self-glorification detracts from what eventually becomes an engrossing and serious narrative, which ominous implications for American foreign policy.  <br />It's best to admit at the outset that Richard A. Clarke is clearly a hot dog and a bit of a blowhard.  The trouble is he seems to have been right about the threat of terrorism when a lot of other people were wrong.  So with a lot of this book you have to pay attention to the message and keep the conceited messenger in the background.  Clarke also is not as infallible as he would like to think and does make the occasional error of fact in this book, including one so early and so egregious I can't believe that it made its way into print without anyone at his publishing house spotting it: on page xiii of the Preface Clarke states that in the Constitution there is an oath that the President should swear.  \\"Forty-three Americans,\\" he writes, \\"have done so since.\\"  This is incorrect.  Grover Cleveland, who served two non-consecutive terms at the end of the 19th Century, is counted as two separate presidents, so forty-two men have sworn that oath.<br />Clarke's cultural references tend toward the clunky (\\"Tarnak farm looked more like Gunga Din's fort than Dorothy's farm in The Wizard of Oz\\"), and the endlessly self-congratulatory tone does get wearisome after awhile.  On page 176 Clarke includes a scene where he acts with such James Bond-ish macho nonchalance when he finds out that Usama bin Laden [as Clarke spells it] wants to have him killed (\\"'Well, that's an interesting way to start the day,' I joked\\") that it becomes unintentionally funny.<br />All that, however, merely obscures the inescapable fact that George W. Bush's administration dropped the ball on homeland security and 3,000 Americans are dead as a result.  And as if that wasn't bad enough, that administration is currently involved in an unnecessary military adventure in Iraq that has killed hundreds of Americans and thousands of Iraqi civilians while permanently scarring our image and credibility abroad - a foreign policy disaster that will most likely take generations to repair.  <br />If you want to know about the string of bad decisions that got us to this place, Richard A. Clarke's book is a clear and convincing account of how this disastrous period in American history has happened.  For that reason alone this book is worth reading.	2004-05-06

While this is a straightforward, sober narrative, with relatively few Bob Woodward-esque \\"you-are-in-the-room-as-history-is-being-made\\" moments, nonetheless it is a lucid, if not always graceful, account of an interesting and complicated politician.<br />Britain's Labour Party had been out of power for almost two decades when Tony Blair climbed what Benjamin Disraeli once called \\"the greasy pole\\" to power.  Helped along the way by the sudden death of Labour leader John Smith (whose passing inspires a characteristically purple passage: \\"The shock of his death was palpable, rippling out from the hushed corridors of Westminster into the nation's living rooms\\"), Blair became the youngest Prime Minister the nation had seen in more than a century.  Taking his cue from Bill Clinton, Blair tried to divest his party of its old leftist baggage (to give just one example, up until the early 90s, according to Hillary Clinton, Labour members addressed each other while speaking at Party Congresses as \\"Comrades\\") while keeping what he felt to be the most important of the reforms that Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had made in the 1980s.  It was a delicate balancing act, made somewhat simpler by the morass the ruling Conservative Party fell into after they ganged up on and deposed Thatcher in 1990, and it ended with Blair winning a smashing victory in 1997, and, more importantly, a second victory in a general election in 2001, enabling him to remain in office longer than any Labour Prime Minister in British history.<br />It makes for an interesting story, and Stephens tells it well, if you don't mind some godawful prose (\\"By the time Tony Blair traveled to Camp David in early September the drumbeat of war had become a discordant din\\"), and the occasional factual inaccuracy (he refers to Alistair Campbell as \\"a reformed alcoholic\\" on page 70 and a \\"recovered alcoholic\\" on page 91 when he is neither, since there's no such thing as either a reformed or a recovered alcoholic - there are only recovering alcoholics and dry drunks, like George W. Bush).  <br />The most glaring inaccuracy in the book, oddly enough, comes with his description of the events of September 11th.  \\"The images of the first passenger jet ramming into the twin towers brought horror and puzzlement,\\" Stephens writes.  \\"When the second hit, everything stopped.\\"  This is, as anyone who remembers the events of that morning knows, nonsense.  There were no images of the first plane ramming into the twin towers on television: not that day, anyway.  Only a French documentary crew caught that ghastly image on camera, and it wasn't shown on television for months.<br />But that whopping mistake aside, his analysis of Blair seems right on the money, and he shows that Blair understands that, as the French give themselves the delusion of continuing to be a world power by opposing whatever the United States does, the British can only delude themselves that they are still players on the world scene by signing on to whatever the United States wants.  This, among other reasons, helps to explain why a man who was so chummy with Bill Clinton could turn around and be equally as intimate with George W. Bush.  About Bush, however, Blair has an insight that Americans would do well to take into consideration: \\"Don't listen to the words,\\" Blair once said of the current occupant of the White House.  \\"Watch what he does.\\"  That's sound advice, and I hope people listen to it.<br />So I can cautiously recommend this book.  It's slim and awkwardly written, but for what it is, a very tentative account of a statesman whose story is far from over, it's worth a look.  Better books about Blair will certainly be written in the future, but until then this one will have to do.	2004-04-27

Bush	Books	5	77	99	N	N	Quietly Devastating	As a sort of corrective to such recent books on the current occupant of the White House as David Frum's \\"The Right Man\\" and John Podhoretz's \\"Bush Country,\\" noted ethicist Peter Singer's book \\"The President of Good & Evil\\" takes a dispassionate but quietly devastating look at George W. Bush's ethical failings in office.  It should be required reading for all Americans who are planning on voting this November.    Singer doesn't get angry and heated over the way that Bush has handled the events of the past few years.  His is a very subdued, rational approach, and as such it is more effective (and, incidentally, more devastating) than fire breathing rhetoric would have been.  He simply subjects Bush's statements to intense ethical scrutiny, and it will surprise no one who doesn't get their opinions from Fox News that, time after time, even when Singer goes out of his way to give him the benefit of the doubt, Bush comes up short.    My favorite example of this is when Bush is pre-taping a radio address the day before he's scheduled to go to California.  The text of the broadcast read: \\"Today I am in California,\\" but Bush kept petulantly saying, \\"But I'm not in California.\\"  Singer's comment on this inane behavior is priceless: \\"Taking the obligation to be truthful so literally suggests an arrested moral development.\\"  And the analysis that flows from this insight, inspired by the work of Harvard psychologist Lawrence Kohlberg, is not only plausible, it's pretty terrifying to consider the very real possibility that we have been led into war and hundreds of Americans have lost their lives because the man running the country is morally retarded.  But I wouldn't bet against it.    Regardless of whether you support George W. Bush or not (and I should think it's pretty clear by now that I do not), you owe it to yourself to read \\"The President of Good & Evil\\" and consider what it says very carefully before you go into the polling place next November.  There's a lot at stake, and this book might make a difference.  I hope it will.	2004-04-22

Landers's \\"An Honest Writer: The Life and Times of James T. Farrell\\" tells the life story of a nearly-forgotten author who seems to be making a comeback at the moment.  Whether he should or not is a matter of debate, but regardless of what you think of Farrell's work, his life certainly makes for an engrossing read.<br />Farrell was a kid of the Chicago streets, and much like another writer of Irish descent, James Joyce, he was never able to transcend his roots.  Just as Joyce couldn't write about anything but the Dublin of his childhood, so Farrell was never able to successfully write about anything but the Chicago of his youth.  Farrell hit it big in the \\"low dishonest decade\\" of the 1930s with the \\"Studs Lonigan\\" trilogy (recently reissued by both Penguin and the Library of America) and followed it up with a series of five novels about his autobiographical protagonist Danny O'Neill.  But although he tried in later years to write more ambitious fiction, his past had its hooks in him and wouldn't let him go.  His later work got more and more feeble, to the point where Farrell himself admitted that a lot of critics wished he had conveniently expired after finishing the third of the Studs Lonigan novels, \\"Judgment Day,\\" at the age of thirty. <br />Landers does a wonderful job in tracing Farrell's development through the streets of Chicago to the murky political waters of 1930s left-wing politics, to a personal life that was as turbulent as any writer's, and arguably a lot less fortunate (although he caught a break towards the end of his life).  It's clear that, between the drinking and the womanizing and the amphetamine-popping, Farrell was no prince to live with, but Landers endows him with a certain nobility as he keeps plugging along, writing book after book, until he's finally done in - as so many people of his generation, from W.H. Auden to Judy Garland, would be - by an addiction to pills.<br />It's not a pretty life, certainly, but Landers describesit amazingly well, and makes you interested enough to track down some of Farrell's books to see if his early reputation as a gritty chronicler of urban realism might be worth salvaging.  I doubt that anyone will make the case for James T. Farrell better than Landers does, and his book should be investigated by anyone who cares about American fiction.	2004-04-22

Dean sets himself up a formidable task in his mini-biography of Warren G. Harding, the latest in the &quot;American Presidents&quot; series.  Harding is generally considered by historians to be one of the worst presidents in history, if not at the absolute bottom of the barrel.  His administration was marred by the nastiest White House scandal until Watergate half a century later.  How can such a tarnished figure be rehabilitated?<br />Yet that's exactly what Dean has tried to do, with mixed results.  Dean says in his Introduction that Harding has been the victim of a grave injustice by historians who have ignored &quot;much of the relevant information about Harding and his presidency.&quot;  This is a personal matter with Dean, who has long been fascinated with Harding and who grew up in Harding's hometown of Marion, Ohio.  So Dean definitely has an agenda to portray Harding in as positive a light as he possibly can, given the facts.<br />And what are those facts?  Dean claims that Nan Britton, who wrote a best-selling book after the president's death claiming that she and Harding had had an affair in the White House and that he fathered her illegitimate daughter, was nothing but an infatuated stalker (keep in mind that Clinton's people once posited the same thing about Monica Lewinsky).  He claims that Harding dealt harshly and, in the words of one historian, &quot;quite appropriately&quot; with those people in his administration who were acting improperly, even though he was unaware of the full extent of their criminality, which would stain his administration after his untimely death.  Dean devotes an entire chapter (in a book that only has nine of them) to the composition of Harding's cabinet and claims that &quot;no president before or after Harding has done any better at cabinet making.&quot;  This is a remarkable statement, and a bit of an exaggeration.  I would suggest that he take a look at George Washington's cabinet, which included at various times John Jay, Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton (and, if you feel like including the Vice President, John Adams) and did not, as Harding's cabinet did, include a future convicted felon.<br />So Dean has not altogether convinced me that Harding was a great president maligned by ignorant historians.  He has convinced me, though, that there might be somewhat more to Harding than the memorable (if nasty) &quot;just a slob&quot; label put on him by the amusingly viperish Alice Roosevelt Longworth (daughter of Teddy).  And while Harding's prose style (labeled &quot;Gamalielese&quot; after his Biblical middle name by H.L. Mencken) is enough to set anyone's teeth on edge (&quot;it is so bad,&quot; Mencken memorably said of it, &quot;that a sort of grandeur creeps into it&quot;), and his administration, which was one of the shortest in history, didn't have time to accomplish anything memorable, Dean makes the case, without quite intending to, that Harding was a decent enough man who was in over his head and who died of overwork trying to live up to the job of being president.  That might be as much of a reevaluation as Harding is ever going to get.	2004-04-16

Such efforts are always open to objection that the author left out this or that aspect of its subject that is worth attention - here, however, I am left amazed at how successfully the author has marshaled his facts.<br />Witcover is no party hack.  When the Democrats have disgraced themselves during their long history, he is not afraid to say so.  Parts of the story that might ordinarily seem to be somewhat less than interesting (such as the long absence of the Democrats from the White House in the decades after the Civil War) are made more interesting than they otherwise might seem.   Controversial matters, such as the sex scandal that engulfed President Clinton's second term and almost toppled him from power, are dispatched with both admirable objectivity and amazing concision - it's hard for me to see how such a tawdry story could be told more fairly.<br />Witcover's style is serviceable without being either obtrusively literary or academically pedestrian, although there is the occasional misstep - when he writes of House Speaker Newt Gingrich being compared to Darth Vader, I don't think labeling Vader as \\"the wicked villain of the Star Wars films\\" is quite necessary - besides, isn't the term \\"wicked villain\\" just a little redundant?  But such stylistic gaucheries are rare - in general, this is a terrific book on a subject that all political junkies will find fascinating.  In this year especially, it's probably a worthwhile thing for people to know what values the Democratic Party stand for, since this country is in need of those values now more than ever.  Read this book.	2004-04-07

But even in its flawed state (it was completed by Richard E. Neustadt), this is an impressive book by an author of great knowledge and erudition that illuminates in intriguingly quirky ways the epochal life of its subject.<br />Jenkins was an Englishman active in Labour politics for half a century, and his is a very British take on Roosevelt's life, which both works and doesn't work to Jenkins' advantage.  It is always problematic when an author is not of the same nationality as the person he's writing about (William Manchester's still-to-be-completed biography of Churchill, for example, was much criticized by the British).  Where Jenkins gains in giving us a new perspective on a oft-told tale, he sometimes loses in dragging in references to the subjects of his previous books (an occupational hazard of the prolific biographer) or comparing some American political situation to its British equivalent when the comparison is tenuous at best. <br />Some of his more British asides are lost on the average American reader (as when he opines that the style and appearance of Groton, the prep school that Roosevelt attended, supposedly an imitation of Eton, &quot;were much more like Cheltenham's or Marlborough's&quot;).  Also, because the author died before he had the chance to read proof, the text is not as precise as it might have been had the author lived longer (there is at least one sentence that defeats my attempt to make sense of it grammatically - it starts on the 19th line of page 73 and begins with the words &quot;In consequence...&quot;).<br />These reservations aside, I am impressed with Jenkins' ability to take a long and complicated life and condense it into the brief span of this American Presidents series, while still making it comprehensible.  The shelves of libraries groan under the weight of the F.D.R. biographies out there, but if you're looking for a concise life that tells the story of the 32nd President from a unique point of view, you might want to try this book before tackling one of the heftier volumes.	2004-04-03

Griffith's protégé and the man behind the Keystone Studio, which produced (or at least discovered) such comic geniuses as Charlie Chaplin and Roscoe Arbuckle.  Well, you'd be right: I am the natural audience for &quot;Keystone: The Life and Clowns of Mack Sennett.&quot;  So why was I so disappointed?<br />It has some new information on the life of the Canadian-born producer and his life and times, but the book is so vilely written that I found it a chore to read.  It almost feels like Louvish, who wrote a far better book on the Marx Brothers and other books on famous comedians that I have not read, fell under the stylistic influence of Gene Fowler, a previous Sennett biographer and the maudlin biographer of John Barrymore, whose prose style is replete with every sappy literary cliché known to man (memorably described by Edmund Wilson: &quot;...the style couldn't be more journalistic in a flowery, old-fashioned way... [it] has no structure and no harmonics.  It is something that is exhaled like breath or exuded like perspiration.&quot;).  If you doubt my word and decide to read the book anyway, try and count the number of times Louvish uses the archaic word &quot;quoth&quot; in a sentence.<br />So I'm torn about this book.  There simply aren't enough good books about this period, and there is some new information to be gleaned from Louvish's pages (although I found myself disagreeing with some, but not all, of his conclusions).  But its wretched prose style, if you have any feeling at all for the English language, will set your teeth on edge.  You might not care if you're a real fan of early silent comedy, and if that's the case go ahead and read it.  But don't say I didn't warn you.	2004-04-02

Authors David Edmonds and John Eidinow, responsible for the best-selling \\"Wittgenstein's Poker,\\" have now turned to the surprisingly gripping 1972 World Championship chess match between Boris Spassky and Bobby Fischer in their new book, \\"Bobby Fischer Goes to War.\\"<br />As someone who is old enough to remember the match (and who watched Shelby Lyman's engagingly dorky commentary about the matches on Channel 13), I thought I knew the outline of this story fairly well.  But Edmonds and Eidinow have come up with plenty of new details about what happened in the Icelandic city of Reykjavik that Summer, and the result is a book that, oddly enough, will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering how a chess match is going to turn out.  Or, given Bobby Fischer's legendary eccentricities, whether the match is going to happen at all.<br />The book is not free from flaws.  Perhaps out of a desire not to alienate the non-chess playing reader, the commentary on the individual games seldom rises above the perfunctory: in fact, they don't bother to print the moves of any given game in their entirety, not even in an appendix, which strikes me as extremely misguided.<br />Also, the book has a few conspicuous errors of fact.  On page 175 the authors mention Henry Kissinger taking Soviet Ambassador Anatoli Dobrynin and his wife to Hollywood \\"to mingle with the stars.\\"  The next sentence begins, \\"There is no record of them meeting the Marx Brothers...\\" which would have been a trifle unlikely, since Harpo and Chico were both long dead by 1972.  On page 228 they claim that the Metropolitan Museum is \\"just up the road from the UN...\\" which they would never have written had they ever actually walked from one building to the other, since they're more than three miles apart (and halfway across town from each other).<br />But the heart of this book is Bobby Fischer, the brilliant but wildly unstable genius who was the most gifted (and easily the most troubled) chess player of the last century.  This story is, as the authors admit towards the end, a tragedy: a perfect example of the saying \\"Be careful what you wish for: you might get it.\\"  Fischer had trained almost all his life with a monomaniacal passion to be the World Chess Champion, although on more than one occasion putting self-destructive obstacles in his own way, as if he was afraid of achieving what everyone said he was destined for, and when he finally achieved his lifelong ambition, he promptly fell apart mentally, to the point where today he is a fugitive from American justice, giving insane interviews to whoever will listen to him spewing out vicious anti-Semitic and anti-American propaganda.<br />The final part of the story, Fischer's descent into seeming madness, is a little skimped by the authors, and really deserves a book of its own (although it would be decidedly depressing reading).  But with all its flaws, this is a fascinating book about a moment in history that anyone, chess player or non-chess player, can find interesting.  And if it intrigues you enough to inspire you to pick up a chess set and start playing, so much the better.	2004-03-28

But they are always marked by his remarkable industry and erudition.  I've enjoyed most of them very much, and his last book, on George Orwell, was excellent.<br />I'm delighted to say that his new book on W. Somerset Maugham is just as good.  It's possible that Meyers feels a rapport with Maugham because, like his subject, Meyers is fantastically prolific and not given his due by the intelligentsia.  Whatever the reason, this is an excellent biography of an underrated writer, and immediately becomes the standard life of its subject.<br />Maugham was a very fertile writer and, like anyone who writes a lot, his production is uneven.  Some of his books -- \\"Of Human Bondage\\" and \\"Cakes and Ale\\" come to mind -- will live as long as any English novels of the last century.  Others, such as his historical novel about Machiavelli, \\"Then and Now,\\" which Edmund Wilson used to unfairly trash his entire body of work in a 1946 New Yorker review, will most likely be forgotten.  But Maugham wrote brilliantly in virtually every genre, from the essay to the spy story (his \\"Ashenden\\" had a noticeable influence on Ian Fleming's creation James Bond) to the travel book to plays (he once had four plays on the West End at once -- a feat that's been seldom duplicated) to the novel and short story, and the best of his work will live.  Meyers illuminates his life with understanding and tact, and avoids (or at least does his best to downplay) the prurient detail so indulged in by other, more sensational biographers (Ted Morgan leaps to mind).<br />So if you're at all intrigued by the most successful author of his time, or if you're already a fan of his work and would like a sympathetic (yet not uncritical) look at his life, I would highly recommend Jeffrey Meyers new biography.  And I can't wait to see which author he tackles next.	2004-03-24

If the author is wise, he or she will resist the temptation, because the second hastily-written book will usually represent a dramatic drop-off in quality from its predecessor.  This is true of Ann Coulter's \\"Treason\\" and Michael Moore's \\"Dude, Where's My Country?\\"  It's also the case with \\"Arrogance,\\" Bernard Goldberg's sequel to \\"Bias.\\"    If \\"Bias\\" could more aptly have been called \\"I Hate Dan Rather So Much!,\\" then \\"Arrogance\\" could more truthfully be called \\"Look at Me! I'm Famous! Woo-Hoo!\\"  I don't exactly begrudge Goldberg exulting in what's left of his 15 minutes of fame, but I have to admit that what he has come up with in \\"Arrogance\\" is a total rip-off.  Thrown together, outrageously padded in order to make it appear to be a real book, the gist of this volume could have served as a twenty-page epilogue to a paperback edition of \\"Bias.\\"  The rest, believe it or not, is filler.  280 pages of filler.     Goldberg does take several pages to attack the people who criticized his first book (with such witty ripostes as - and this is a direct quote - \\"I was really annoyed!\\"), and plumps several more pages with quotes garnered from the right-wing Media Research Center, but then so much of this book is padding (several \\"chapters\\" consist of a single page, one of only five lines of text - if you're counting, that's only two more than a haiku poem) that it's difficult to wade through the filler in order to get to the tiny fraction of the text that actually says something.      Perhaps because this book was written (or, rather, assembled) so hastily, some of Goldberg's own biases are starting to show.  For example, only two people are allowed to \\"smartly observe\\" something in this book, and they're both conservative (Ann Coulter on page 44, and Betsy Hart on page 183).  Also, Goldberg refers to conservative Hilton Kramer as \\"a distinguished critic and social thinker,\\" yet liberal economist Paul Krugman is described as \\"a one-note samba left-wing ideologue.\\"  In addition, his research is less than thorough.  Goldberg's statement that David Brock's \\"Blinded by the Right,\\" a self-serving mea culpa of Brock's former career as a right-wing hatchet man, was given a free ride by the mainstream media is demonstrably false.  The book was scathingly reviewed both by the Washington Post and on Time magazine's website.  You know how I know that?  Because I wrote the latter review.      Some of his prescriptions for changing the media are, to put it mildly, a little tired.  Goldberg thinks for example that it's a startlingly original idea to suggest that major news organizations move to cities elsewhere than New York.  Gee, Bernie, remember CNN in Atlanta?  Or even further back, when Time magazine moved its entire editorial offices to Ohio?  By the way I'm not making that up - they really did - and it was a disaster.     I'm not going to say that everything Goldberg says is incorrect.  Too often the New York Times does tell other media outlets what to think, and Hillary Clinton did far too often get coverage that was fawning at best.  But Goldberg doesn't really say anything here that he didn't say in his earlier book (which wasn't that good to begin with), and too much of the sequel is padding.  If this was a 20-page pamphlet, I would suggest that you give it a glance even if only to disagree with it.  But this skimpy little volume is not worth the money, and its conclusions have pretty much been demolished by Eric Alterman in his book \\"What Liberal Media?\\"  So my advice is to forget about \\"Arrogance\\" and read \\"What Liberal Media?\\" instead.	2003-12-10

Laura Ingraham is incensed at the elites - it's just that she has a difficult time explaining who those elites are, and that's a major stumbling block in her new book, \\"Shut Up & Sing.\\"<br />Unlike her fellow conservative Ann Coulter, Ingraham is a halfway decent prose stylist and, far more importantly, not a complete lunatic.  She makes a decent enough (if somewhat demagogic) case that America is under attack by elites who despise right thinking decent patriotic God-fearing Americans.  If you read this book quickly, or just skim it, you might find yourself agreeing with some of her points.<br />The trouble is that under any real scrutiny her argument falls apart.  She is sometimes wrong on the facts: for instance she claims on page 27 that in 1980 President Jimmy Carter \\"almost lost to Ted Kennedy\\" when Kennedy was effectively crushed by Carter winning two-thirds of the primaries -- try asking John Kerry if he'd mind \\"almost losing\\" like that.  She also claims that the Nazis were deeply anti-Christian -- if that's the case, why did Himmler specifically bar atheists from joining the SS (a fact you can find on page 197 of \\"The Third Reich\\" by Michael Burleigh)?  She's sometimes mean-spirited (her attack on Michael Moore is even nastier and more personal than Ann Coulter's, which you have to admit is saying something), and, more disturbingly, her discussion of European intellectuals is ripped off wholesale from John Carey's book \\"The Intellectuals and the Masses\\" without giving the author any credit whatsoever.<br />Then there's the problem of the very definition of elites.  Who makes up these nasty elites anyway?  Are they liberals?  Well, no, not necessarily, because according to Ingraham the Wall Street Journal's rabidly right-wing editorial page qualifies.  \\"Of course when I use the term 'elite,' I mean elite in their own minds,\\" Ingraham writes -- and what does this mean exactly?  Does Ingraham think that fundamentalist Christians who fervently believe that theyalone will go to heaven while the rest of us poor slobs roast in eternal hellfire aren't \\"elite in their own minds\\"?  Try asking Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson that question.  A term that encompasses Noam Chomsky, Enron, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the Dixie Chicks is so elastic as to be totally meaningless.  <br />What the argument of Ingraham's book boils down to is that Laura Ingraham doesn't like people who disagree with her and/or her values.  Well, Laura, that's just too damn bad.  Last time I checked this was still, in spite of the attempts of George W. Bush's White House and John Ashcroft's Justice Department to make it less so, a free country -- and if Laura Ingraham doesn't like it, I would contend that that's her problem.	2003-12-08

These two men have to be, along with John F. Kennedy and possibly Adolf Hitler, the most written-about men of the 20th Century.  Certainly I've read Roy Jenkins, William Manchester, Martin Gilbert and many others on Churchill, and Kenneth Davis, Joseph Lash and several others on Roosevelt.  <br />So what is left for Jon Meacham to do?  What he can do is tell an old story in a new way, and find various tid-bits of information that might not have been available to previous biographers.  They don't amount to much, and there are few dazzling revelations here, but it's nice to get the occasional new nugget of fact in the midst of a lot of material you know practically by heart.<br />I don't mean to knock this book, however: it's quite good.  Meacham writes a solid, workmanlike prose, and tells the story well.  If you're not a Churchill or Roosevelt buff, this is a good place to start learning about the relationship that saved Western Civilization in what might well have been its darkest hour.  And if you are familiar with the story, it's a good retelling of it that makes you want to hear it all over again.<br />Meacham is a little too hard on Roosevelt (whose deceit and duplicity tends to make him wax a wee bit judgmental), and a bit sentimental when it comes to Churchill (who could endlessly bloviate at the drop of a hat), but otherwise I give this book high marks, and recommend it to those who would like to know more about these two enigmatic and endlessly interesting men.	2003-11-26

It seems that whether you're a Democrat or a Republican, liberal or conservative, if you put out a book saying that people who think your way are true upstanding Americans and the people who disagree with you are the scum of the earth, those who agree with your opinion of the other side will rush out and buy your book - no matter how sloppily written it is.<br />This goes a long way towards explaining the unevenness of Michael Moore's new book, &quot;Dude, Where's My Country?&quot;  Part anti-conservative jeremiad, part liberal diatribe, it's alternately amusing, thought-provoking and annoying - in about equal measure.<br />There are entire chapters that read like they were ground out under deadline pressure and can easily be skipped: as with the third chapter, &quot;Oil's Well That Ends Well&quot; (when an author uses a bad pun for a chapter heading, you know you're in serious trouble): it starts out like a bad imitation of those pieces Woody Allen used to crank out for The New Yorker in the 1970s (&quot;Last night I had a dream.  Actually I had a number of dreams.  One had something to do with smearing Tofutti on a camel.&quot;), and goes downhill from there.<br />But on occasion Moore can suddenly tell the truth in such an unflinching way that you realize just what's been going on in this country in the past two years.  &quot;It is my firm belief that Bush and his cronies (especially Attorney General John Ashcroft) have only one goal in mind: To scare the bejesus out of us so that whatever bill they want passed, whatever powers they want Congress to give them, we will happily hand it over.&quot;  This strikes me as being exactly right.  I also agree with him when he writes on page 114 that &quot;Bush failed to do his job and it may have cost 3,000 people their lives.  That alone should be enough to haul him before an impeachment tribunal.&quot;<br />So this book is uneven.  Some of the attempts at comedy just fall flat.  Some of the rhetoric rings hollow.  But if you do some discreet skipping of the more dorky prose you will find a good reason why the current occupant of the White House and his anti-democratic agenda should be opposed.  And that's a good enough reason to read this book.	2003-11-21

In other words, this book belongs to the \\"Minor Characters\\" school of literary history (pioneered by Joyce Johnson, the one-time girlfriend of Jack Kerouac): instead of writing about the men who write, write about the women who hang around the men who write, because even though they never wrote anything worth reading, they nevertheless slept with people who did, and that makes them interesting in their own right -- right? <br />I've never been too sure about this thesis, but the fact is that Sonia Orwell was a pretty interesting person in her own right, and her life makes for absorbing reading, even if only on a gossip level. <br />Brownell worked at Cyril Connolly's \\"Horizon,\\" the great British literary magazine of the 1940s, and either knew, befriended or had intimate relations with many of the great writers and artists of the period, many of whom she inspired.  From Francis Bacon, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Lucian Freud to Michel Leiris (whose works, hitherto unknown to me, I am now decidedly curious about), it seemed that Brownell knew or slept with just about everyone worth knowing or sleeping with during that time frame, and Spurling makes a convincing case that it was Brownell, and not the sybaritically indolent Connolly, who really kept \\"Horizon\\" going during its glory days of World War II, when it really seemed to many literate observers asif the magazine was the only thing keeping the torch of culture lit during Europe's painfully protracted Gotterdammerung. <br />Among the many authors intrigued by Brownell was George Orwell, already suffering from the tuberculosis that would kill him, and he immortalized Brownell by using her as the model for Julia, the heroine of his last novel \\"1984.\\"  He also fell in love with her, and clutching at the straws of romantic love (never overly reliable at the best of times), he persuaded her to marry him in the delusional hope that it would keep him alive: it didn't.  And while this transformed Brownell into (as many people maliciously called her) The Widow Orwell, it also gave her the responsibility of looking after his estate, editing his works for posthumous publication and generally complying with his wishes (among them the wish that no biography be written), which Spurling believes she did far more conscientiously than her abundant detractors have been willing to admit.<br />In most of the Orwell biographies you read, Sonia Brownell Orwell doesn't come off very well, usually being portrayed as a golddigging slut, and Spurling's portrait is a praiseworthy attempt to redress the balance.  She even advances the claim that looking after Orwell's interest in the long run not only made Brownell miserable but eventually killed her.  I'm not so sure about that, but I will admit that Spurling makes Brownell seem like the thoroughly fascinating person she must have been in life, and this slim volume is definitely worth reading to find out not only who she was, but why she's worth remembering.	2003-11-06

Spending most of his life as a provincial Anglican clergyman (albeit a randy one) with a wife he didn't get along with and on whom he cheated compulsively, troubled by the tuberculosis that would eventually kill him, he became famous overnight in his mid-forties with the publication of the first volumes of Tristram Shandy in 1760.  While Sterne has never lacked for either admirers or detractors (some of the former are Thomas Jefferson, Friedrich Nietzsche and Virginia Woolf; examples of the latter are Samuel Johnson and William Makepeace Thackeray), he has somehow survived as one of the magnificent oddities of English literature.<br />Since the 1970s, Sterne's greatest champion has been Dr. Melvyn New of the University of Florida, whose edition of Sterne's Works has become the standard texts of Tristram Shandy and his Sermons.  Now Dr. New has added a sixth volume to the series, consisting of A Sentimental Journey and Continuation of the Bramine's Journal. <br />At the time Sterne began A Sentimental Journey in 1767 (he never finished it -- what we have are the first two volumes of a projected four), he was at a crossroads in his career as a writer.  The later volumes of Tristram Shandy had not sold as well or caused the stir of the earlier volumes, and Sterne may have felt that he had taken its strain of satiric ribaldry as far as it could go -- at any rate, he decided to change course, and to indulge in the then-popular mode of fictional pathos.  To elicit a furtive tear, rather than a sly guffaw, was now his aim, and whether this was simple careerism or a genuine change of heart is for each reader to decide (although the evidence of the Bramine's Journal, never intended for publication, indicates that the latter was most likely the case).<br />The text of A Sentimental Journey doesn't present insurmountable difficulties (Sterne, unlike Swift, always scrupulously prepared his works forthe press, and in any event Dr. New has the precedent, graciously acknowledged, of Gardner Stout's 1967 University of California Press edition), but the Florida edition, as impeccable as its scholarship is, is more interesting for what it doesn't do than for what it does.  Unlike the Stout edition, in which a tiny island of text can be overwhelmed by a tsunami of annotation, New's Florida text is unencumbered by its nonetheless impressive scholarly apparatus, which is printed in the back.  Dr. New is that academic rarity -- a scholar who actually gives a damn about the non-scholarly reader.  The result, as with the rest of the Florida Sterne, is an edition that manages to have it both ways -- impeccable scholarship that does not overwhelm a text that is presented in a way so that it can be enjoyed for its own sake.  Would that there were more editors like him.<br />Sterne is the poet of nuance (although at times his more earthy side takes over -- at one point he asks a woman hidden from him by a curtain &quot;if she wanted anything,&quot; and gets back the reply, &quot;Rien que pisser,&quot; which means just what you think it means), and there are times when the more lachrymal sentiments of the late 18th Century, so trendy then, feel strained now.  But he sometimes managed to combine his empathy for others with his appreciation of the odd and the grotesque, as when he notices, at the opera comique, a dwarf with his view blocked by a &quot;tall, corpulent German, near seven feet high, who stood directly betwixt him and all possibility of his seeing either the stage or the actors.&quot;  <br />Mostly, however, A Sentimental Journey is about the exhilarating minutiae of traveling, unencumbered (as Sterne was at times when he made the journeys in France and Italy that inspired the book) by either wife of child, and moving through, as he mentions several times, a country with which his own was, at that time, at war.  &quot;I seldom go to the place I set out for,&quot; Sterne comments at one point, and the unpredictability of his peregrinations make the book feel more like life, and less like literature, than most books of his time -- or even ours.  He can manage a delicacy of feeling combined with an intricacy of expression that make him seem a precursor of Proust.<br />The other work contained in the volume, Continuation of the Bramine's Journal (one wishes that Dr. New had been a tad less pedantically accurate and chosen instead the less holographically correct but inarguably more effective title that Sterne biographer Wilbur L. Cross gave it: the Journal to Eliza) is a diary kept by Sterne in the last year of his life and intended for a 23-year-old married woman named Eliza Draper, with whom Sterne had become hopelessly infatuated (an infatuation all the more hopeless since the lady's husband was in Bombay, where Eliza would soon join him).  At their parting Sterne began keeping a journal that he assumed would be reciprocated by Eliza, and that at some point they would meet again and share their respective sentiments.  Never published during his lifetime, it makes Sterne seem either hopelessly romantic or more than a little pathetic -- depending, I suppose, on one's age and/or gender.  At any event, Sterne never saw Eliza again.<br />Together, these two works of the final year of Sterne's life give us both an impressive and moving Portrait of the Artist as a Dying Man, and Dr. New and the University Press of Florida are to be congratulated for their persistence in putting out, over a period of three decades, so splendid an edition of a classic author.  This latest volume more than lives up to the high standards of the previous five, and should be read by anyone even remotely curious about one of the most curious and brilliant authors ever to write in English.	2003-10-25

It's not just that she dislikes them - she hates them.  Really really really hates them.  Got that?  Good - because once you've realized that, you no longer have any reason to read \\"Treason,\\" Coulter's new work of anti-liberal propaganda. <br />Coulter's dubious thesis is that, ever since the end of World War II, liberals have been engaged in a perfidious conspiracy to undermine and attack America.  Having engaged in contemporary polemics in her previous bellicose right-wing diatribe \\"Slander,\\" Coulter now turns to the past to prove that what she dislikes about liberals is part of an ongoing historical process that goes as far back as World War II.  Unfortunately, Coulter is both an ignorant and an inept historian.<br />To give just one example of her errors, Coulter writes, \\"In 1945...The Nation magazine derided the atrocity films of Hitler's death camps as a hoax.\\"  This is pretty shocking: it's also not true.  If you look at her notes, she cites, not James Agee (whom she clearly hasn't read), but Paul Johnson's \\"History of the Jews.\\"  If she had bothered to read the article (which is in \\"Agee on Film\\": it's on page 149-50 or, if you're looking at an earlier edition, the review for May 19, 1945), she would have seen that nowhere does Agee use the word \\"hoax,\\" and he clearly is not doubting the authenticity of the footage - merely the political uses to which the footage is being put.  This is symbolic of Coulter's method as a historian. <br />Even when Coulter is correct (in the sense in which a broken clock is correct twice a day), she's right for the wrong reasons.  She claims on page 126 that \\"The Russians would never have dared to take advantage of Nixon by delivering nuclear missiles to Cuba,\\" but claims that they did so as a direct result of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, when the fact is that placing the missiles in Cuba was Khrushchev's personal choice, and he did so as a direct result of his face-to-face meeting with Kennedy at Vienna, where he came to the (incorrect) conclusion that Kennedy was someone who could be bullied.  Coulter never mentions Vienna - possibly because her analysis of any event before 1980 is pretty much ripped off wholesale from the books of British right-wing Historian Paul Johnson (incidentally, Johnson was publicly outed some years ago by his longtime mistress as a enthusiastic recipient of what they call \\"le vice Anglais,\\" joining Newt Gingrich, Henry Hyde and Rush Limbaugh in the Conservative Hypocrite Hall of Fame - what is it with these right-wingers, anyway?). <BR>     <BR>The hero of \\"Treason\\" is Senator Joe McCarthy.  Coulter sees McCarthy as a patriot.  A hero.  A man unjustly vilified, persecuted and finally hounded to death and martyred by - you guessed it! - liberals.  \\"McCarthy was beloved by workers,\\" Coulter writes.  \\"He had a gift for appealing to the great common sense of the American people.  He made broad points that captured headlines and rallied Americans.  Normal Americans could not believe their fellow countrymen could be so dastardly as not to love their country.  For them. McCarthy was a poet... No matter how much the elites ridiculed McCarthy, lots of Americans seemed to like him.\\"  <br />The subtext here is that Ann Coulter envisions herself as a latter-day Joe McCarthy, and her identification with him is so complete that in defending McCarthy she's really defending herself from all those attacks by nasty, unpatriotic liberals who are so dastardly (and who, by the way, was the last author to use the word \\"dastardly\\" in a sentence with a straight face?  Ayn Rand?  Danielle Steel?) as not to love their country.  Or Ann Coulter for that matter - at which point we start getting to the real point of \\"Treason.\\"<br />\\"Treason\\" is nothing but a hastily written and thinly-disguised attempt by Ann Coulter to defend herself against the onslaught of the left after her last book was so widely (and justly) discredited.  You see, if liberals are nothing but abunch of traitors who hate and attack America at every opportunity, than what they say about Ann Coulter doesn't count - get it?  Only Tail Gunner Annie doesn't have the guts to defend herself against her critics directly.  So she does it indirectly, using Joe McCarthy as her proxy.  Coulter is acting here less out of respect for the facts than from the dictates of a psychological imperative that is best left to a professional to explain.<br />So unless you're as obsessed with Ann Coulter as Coulter seems to be with Bill Clinton (who haunts this book the way that the head of King Charles I haunts Mr. Dick in Dickens's \\"David Copperfield\\"), there really is no reason to read this book, unless you're either a rabid right-winger or a total masochist.	2003-10-25
US	47672944	R2HGCK6DNQ4TD0	0525947647	857217799	Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them	Books	2	4	7	N	N	Not Nearly As Good As It Should Have Been	Al Franken's \\"Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right\\" is part of an unofficial liberal trilogy designed to confute the arguments of such right-wing conservative authors as Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reilly.  As with the other two books, Joe Conason's \\"Big Lies\\" and Eric Alterman's  \\"What Liberal Media?,\\" how well you think he does depends to a certain extent on where you fall along the ideological spectrum.<br />Having read and liked the other two books, I have to admit that Franken's book (which for the sake of brevity I'll refer to as \\"LATLLWTT:AFABLATR\\") was far less effective than I thought it would be, and frankly a little disappointing.  While a certain amount of latitude should be given to a political satirist who is essentially a comedy writer rather than a serious writer on politics or public policy, I still have to say that this book is profoundly flawed.<br />There are some instances where Franken is just, as the Brits would say, spot on - his account of how he refuted the arguments of Bernard Goldberg, author of the mendacious best-seller \\"Bias,\\" on live television is both hilarious and convincing.  And the chapter \\"Operation Ignore\\" makes a convincing case that, had Al Gore been occupying the White House in 2001, the events of September 11 might never have happened.  However, there are other parts where he crosses the line between satire and the same kind of mean-spiritedness he declares so reprehensible when indulged in by conservatives.<br />He's also on occasion just plain wrong.  For example, he makes a big deal of Ann Coulter in her recent book \\"Slander\\" saying her book has 780 footnotes when her book has endnotes, and not footnotes.  This is a valid criticism, and one which I made of Coulter myself in my Amazon.com review of \\"Slander.\\"  However, for Franken to go on to say that using endnotes instead of footnotes is in and of itself \\"lying\\" because \\"Endnotes are much harder to reference\\" is just ridiculous.  Franken knows full well that no mainstream publisher would permit an author to publish a book that was written for a wide, non-scholarly audience with 780 footnotes in the text.  It just wouldn't happen.  Blaming Coulter, therefore, for not doing what no mainstream publisher would allow her to do is hypocritical. <br />He is also not immune to the same kind of ad hominem attacks that he professes to deplore.  His treatment of Fox News star blowhard Bill O'Reilly in particular is pretty crass.  His constant reference to O'Reilly's appearance as \\"splotchy\\" and his incessant personal attacks (such as claiming on page 65 that O'Reilly's book is called \\"Living with Herpes\\") make it pretty clear that this is not simply politics but a personal vendetta.  O'Reilly is easy enough to skewer without having to get this nasty about it.  I should also point out that Al Franken is no Brad Pitt himself, so for him to indict O'Reilly for the way he looks is a bit like the pot calling the kettle unattractive. <br />Franken had, as Hillary Clinton might say, \\"a lot of help\\" writing this book from no less than 14 assistants at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.  Now, in and of itself there's nothing wrong with using assistants to do research (Winston Churchill, for example, had almost as much help while drafting his \\"History of the English Speaking Peoples\\"), but the result seems to be a book that's structurally disjointed and way too long. <br />\\"LATLLWTT:AFABLATR\\" would be a much better book if it was at least one-third shorter.  It seems that, having had all this help, Franken felt somehow constrained to use everything that he was given to work with, and the result is a book that is overstuffed with what feels like filler (and outright errors: you would think that he would be able to spell correctly the name of the woman he calls on page 162 a \\"courageous whistleblower\\": it's Coleen Rowley, not Colleen Rowley - to be fair, CNN made the same error).  While we're nit-picking, he also undercounts the number of times Ann Coulter claimed in \\"Slander\\" that \\"Ronald Reagan won the Cold War\\": it was eight times, not seven (I may not have gone to Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, but I can count). <br />There are sections that are painfully unfunny, such as the entire chapter \\"Operation Chickenhawk: Episode One,\\" which reminded me that Al Franken is not just the best-selling author of \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot\\" but also the screenwriter of \\"Stuart Saves His Family,\\" one of the biggest bombs of recent years.  It should have been cut, along with the pointless chapter where Franken goes to the racist Bob Jones University in an attempt to get one of his assistants admitted.  Likewise the chapter \\"The Gospel of Supply Side Jesus,\\" which is both hamfisted and unfunny.<br />Don't get me wrong: there are plenty of things to like about this book.  It's just that other writers have done it better, without all the vitriol and filler.  While I was hoping to recommend this book, I now find myself, with some regret, saying that if you want to read a book that takes on the radical right and their agenda for America, you're much better off reading either Joe Conason or Eric Alterman - especially Alterman.  Perhaps refuting the radical right is too important a task to be left to comedians.	2003-10-25
US	47672944	RO8QKGDAF3WKY	0312306369	321663509	An Execution in the Family: One Son's Journey	Books	4	23	31	N	N	Powerful and Deeply Moving	Robert Meeropol's memoir of life as one of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg's two sons, with its sardonic title echoing James Agee's novel \\"A Death in the Family\\" (although strictly speaking it's incomplete, since Meeropol had *two* executions in his family), is a powerful and moving account of growing up under the shadow of the legalized murder of both his parents by the United States government.<br />Having a parent in prison is not easy for a child.  Having a parent executed is even worse.  But having had *both* your parents executed for crimes they almost certainly did not commit, and having them become for a time the most vilified couple in America is a huge psychic burden, one which Meeropol repressed for a long time.  In many ways, as he points out, he was fortunate -- he was adopted by a loving couple who raised both him and his older brother well.  He received a good education, married and began a career and a family.  But underneath it all was a secret he told to almost no one until he was in late twenties: that his parents had been sent to the electric chair for conspiracy to commit espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union.<br />Not all of Meeropol's book is about the Rosenberg Case.  He has had an interesting life on his own merits, and much of it makes for engrossing reading.  If I have any reservations at all about the book it's because, maybe due to his being dyslexic, possibly because he's worked with children for many years, Meeropol's prose style is a little simplistic.  To put it mildly.  He uses commas so sparingly that I began to suspect he'd read way too much Hemingway.  An average paragraph will read: CLAUSE COMMA CLAUSE FULLSTOP CLAUSE COMMA CLAUSE FULL STOP CLAUSE COMMA CLAUSE FULL STOP.  I'm not saying that he should have necessarily imitated the later Henry James, but the unintentionally faux-Hemingway prose style does get a little monotonous at times.<br />The most gripping part of the book for me was Meeropol's growing realization that, while his parents were almost certainly not guilty of the charges for which they were executed, he was forced \\"to accept the possibility that my father had participated in an illegal and covert effort to help the Soviet Union defeat the Nazis\\" by supplying them with technical military information not related to the atomic bomb.  Reading his son's account of how he came to grips with the fact that Julius Rosenberg allowed his devotion to the Communist ideology to enable him to give military secrets to the Russians (who, it should be pointed out, were our allies at the time) in spite of the disaster that it brought to his family, you are impressed with Robert Meeropol's desire to find out the truth about his parents, no matter what it might be.  <br />Meeropol makes a strong case that, not only was his father not guilty of providing the Russians with the secret of the atomic bomb, he was executed along with his wife as the result of a criminal conspiracy between the attorney general of the United States and a Supreme Court Justice, who worked together to obstruct justice with the intent of placing them in the electric chair.  Further, it is quite possible that Ethel Rosenberg may have been completely innocent of any wrongdoing at all.  Meeropol's parents, he writes, \\"were killed not for any crime they may have committed, but because they were Communists who would not cooperate with the FBI.\\"<br />I can't recommend this book too highly.  It depicts one of the most important and tragic stories in American history as seen through the eyes of one of its victims who refused to be victimized.  Today Meeropol is a staunch opponent of the death penalty and runs the Rosenberg Fund for Children, a charity that aids the children of political prisoners -- a very appropriate way of honoring his parents' memory.  You owe it to yourself to read this book.  You may not agree with everything he says, but what he has to say should be heard.	2003-10-11

Which is arguably true, assuming of course that you're a complete hack.<br />Not that this book is total garbage: it's not.  But it's so thin and insubstantial, sounding at times like something Carlson cranked out at his desk during his lunch hour, that unless you're eager to waste your money buying a book that's sure to be remaindered faster than you can say, \\"Where Are The Weapons of Mass Destruction?\\" it's not worth your time.<br />There are, however, some good things in it.  I particularly liked Carlson's breathless encomium to British journalists: \\"I've run into a lot of them while covering stories, and generally they're impressive: witty, well-educated, and physically brave.  They're also frequently drunk.  As a rule, a British reporter will begin boozing at the first opportunity, and won't stop until he passes out or you run out of money.\\"  This is, as Gore Vidal would say, splendid stuff.  And the story of how Carlson was falsely accused of rape by a self-proclaimed mentally ill fan, a false charge that ended up costing Carlson $14,000 in legal fees, is pretty amusing (although I'm sure it wasn't for Carlson, who does everything but print the woman's home phone number).<br />Carlson takes some engagingly heterodox positions, including taking on Fox News self-absorbed blowhard Bill O'Reilly for being a self-absorbed blowhard who has started to believe his own publicity.  His account of how O'Reilly boasted of his faux-credentials as a war correspondent at a discussion panel in Washington on \\"The Press in Wartime\\" in front of many of the real thing, which, as Carlson points out, is \\"a little like bragging about your National Guard experience to a room full of Navy SEALs,\\" is surprisingly honest coming from an avowed conservative.  It's nice to know that Carlson can occasionally espouse positions that are somewhat more intelligent than the ones he spews on cable television.<br />But it's not enough for me to recommend \\"Politicians, Partisans and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News,\\" which is a puny little book that tries to capitalize in a cynical way on its author's rapidly shrinking fifteen minutes of fame.  Unless you're the kind of person who buys every single book on politics that comes down the Beltway, give this one a pass.ndent at a discussion panel in Washington on \\"The Press in Wartime\\" in front of many of the real thing, which, as Carlson points out, is \\"a little like bragging about your National Guard experience to a room full of Navy SEALs,\\" is surprisingly honest coming from an avowed conservative.

US	47672944	R9H1XZLED685A	0465092608	256532683	The Courage To Be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, And The Future Of The Church	Books	1	24	69	N	N	The Church Needs Better Apologists Than This	George Weigel's \\"The Courage to be Catholic\\" is a lame attempt to whitewash the Catholic Church and the corrupt way it has dealt with the recent scandals involving sexual abuse of minors by Catholic priests.<br />First, let me get my own biases out of the way: although I am part Irish, and come from a Catholic background, I was not raised Catholic (although relatives of mine were).  I never attended parochial schools, and was never molested by a priest or smacked on the palm by a nun's ruler.  I have no particular animus, in other words, against the Church.  I assume that an institution that's been around for 2,000 years must have something going for it.<br />Let me give some examples of the intellectual dishonesty that is rampant in this book:<br />When Weigel writes about \\"a new generation of Catholic intellectuals bored by the classic agenda of dissent,\\" you want to ask, \\"Could you name at least some of these intellectuals, please?\\"  <br />When he says that \\"A distinguished Catholic philosopher who thinks himself extremely orthodox once said, 'If the Pope said '2+2=5,' I'd believe him.'\\" you want to demand: \\"Who the hell was this idiot?\\" <br />When he quotes \\"one reporter for a prominent national daily\\" and refuses to name said reporter, or even the \\"prominent national daily,\\" you just start thinking that this is a pattern of dishonesty.  <br />This book has no scholarly apparatus of any kind: no footnotes, no endnotes, no bibliography: nothing.  No way to check his sources or determine his credibility.  When you're acting as an apologist for an institution as troubled (and whose credibility is as harshly questioned) as the Catholic Church, you'd better be able to back up what you say.  Weigel doesn't even bother.  <BR> <BR>I get the distinct impression that George Weigel thinks his readers are complete imbeciles.  How else to explain the fact that he feels it necessary to identify Robert Frost as \\"poet Robert Frost\\"?  Or the fact that he repeats the same pointsin the same words over and over again (I'd like to have a dime for every time Weigel uses the word \\"countercultural\\")?  Is he just lazy?  Sloppy?  Badly edited?  Or does he have the same contempt for his readers that Catholic Bishops have seemed to have had towards their parishioners, expecting to have everything he says unquestioningly accepted at face value?<br />Everything wrong with the Church, according to Weigel, is the fault of anything and anyone except the Church itself.  At various times he blames Protestantism, liberals, the media, Catholic \\"dissenters\\" -- he simply refuses to see the reason why American Catholics are so outraged by the fact that so many examples of priestly misconduct (which is a polite  euphemism for priests raping children) have been covered up and paid off by the Church for decades.<br />Weigel claims that \\"there is no reliable data to support [the] claim\\" that clerical sexual abuse is ongoing and widespread, although the millions of dollars paid out in what can only be described as hush money to outraged victims and parents might seem to belie that assertion.  It may not be \\"ongoing\\" (priests seem to have finally gotten the message that messing with children is considered unacceptable), but saying that the pattern of deception is not widespread (and probably ongoing) is just jesuitical quibbling.  <br />Weigel resorts to the most blatant sophistry to try and deny that the Catholic Church is \\"authoritarian\\" when it's obvious to just about anyone that it is exactly that -- and that this is the cause of so much of the tension between American Catholics and the Vatican.  Lord Acton is famous for saying that \\"Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely,\\" but few people realize that he was talking about the Pope when he said it.  The Catholic Church is an absolute autocracy in which the Pope is judged infallible and cannot be overruled.  Americans believe in dissent while the Church demands obedience.  Too many American Catholicsare under the delusion that the Church is a democracy -- they could not be further from the truth.  And the fact that the Church does not consider itself to be accountable to its members is a large part of the problem.    <br />Weigel writes that the fact that so many Americans were asking \\"Why doesn't Rome do something about this?\\" was testimony to \\"the confidence that the great majority of U.S. Catholics have in Pope John Paul II.\\"  It was nothing of the kind.  It testified to the very American attitude that if there is a screw up in a corporation and it's seen to be systemic (such as Enron or WorldCom), the guy in charge should step up and take responsibility.  If the Church was a regular corporation, the Pope would have been forced to resign by the stockholders years ago.  Instead, it's the stockholders, so to speak, who have been voting with their feet -- and leaving the Church in droves.  <br />This book is a miserable and intellectually dishonest attempt to whitewash the Catholic Church from its culpability in a disgraceful scandal that has demolished whatever credibility the Church may have had with many Americans.  Will it survive?  Probably.  The Church has undergone many trials in the past 2,000 years and has always survived them.  It may even emerge from this painful time in its history stronger and better than before.  One can always hope.  But I can tell you one thing: it's going to need a hell of a better defense than this.	2003-10-03
US	47672944	R29YMFGAFU5LW9	0060515163	343152070	Mr. S: My Life with Frank Sinatra	Books	2	6	12	N	N	An Entertaining (Albeit Scummy) Book	George Jacobs worked for Frank Sinatra for almost twenty years, before being unceremoniously dumped by him in 1968 after the tabloids wrote about him dancing at a nightclub with Sinatra's soon-to-be-ex-wife, Mia Farrow.  So why did he wait until now -- 35 years later -- to tell his story?    The reason is clear once you begin reading Mr. S.  The fact is that this is an extraordinarily sleazy book, and it's one that could never have been published during Frank Sinatra's lifetime without a major lawsuit.  Fortunately for George Jacobs, and unfortunately for Frank Sinatra, you can't libel the dead.    If you read carefully, you'll notice that Jacobs (and his ghostwriter, William Stadiem, whose voice predominates) only trashes the dead.  He is very careful not to say anything potentially litigious about those Sinatra friends or intimates (like, for example, Shirley MacLaine) who are still around to sue him.    But for those who *aren't* around to sue Jacobs and his ghostwriter, the sky's the limit when it comes to slander, and Jacobs goes out of his way to portray anyone who looked at him crosswise as the scum of the earth (he takes some shots at director Billy Wilder and superagent \\"Swifty\\" Lazar, but his depiction of JFK's father, Ambassador Joseph P. Kennedy, is particularly vile).      There's pretty much nothing these guys won't stoop to in the way of gossip and sleaze.  Is any of it true?  All of it?  I have no way of knowing, but I'll admit that while this book is an entertaining read if you have a taste for really nasty Hollywood gossip related in a very ugly tone of voice (one tidbit: Frank Sinatra had to have sex every night, and if he'd run out of call girls, and if Judy Garland wasn't around, he'd fall back as a last resort on his neighbor Peggy Lee: isn't that special?), I felt like I had to take several showers after finishing it.    Jacobs depicts Sinatra as an ugly, insecure thug with a taste for gangsters, childish pranks (mostly involving explosives) and an endless parade of hookers.  And how many pages of hookers, mobsters and idiotic pranks can you wade through, anyway?  There is one point where Jacobs portrays noted family man Dean Martin walking after an early morning golf game into a Sinatra house filled with six hookers in various stages of undress and unconsciousness after a long night of partying, and Martin looks at Jacobs and says, \\"You'd think they'd be sick of this same old s--t by now, wouldn't you, George?\\"  But that's the problem -- Sinatra never did, and it really gets tedious after a while.      So if you like your sleaze straight up and without a chaser, I guess I can hesitantly recommend Mr. S, assuming that you have a strong stomach.  But if you admire Frank Sinatra, and have any desire to think well of him, I would skip this very ugly book.	2003-09-16

The &quot;elephants&quot; in this case are right-wing writers such as Bernard Goldberg and Ann Coulter, both of whom have made names for themselves (and bestsellers) decrying what they claim is the leftist bias in what they like to call the &quot;mainstream media.&quot;<br />Having worked in the &quot;mainstream media&quot; myself, I'm in a position to know that this position is ridiculous, and Alterman makes a strong case that the reverse is true -- that a well-funded and hysterical right-wing cabal have so terrorized the media that they display a conservative, rather than a liberal bias.  Whether it's the contempt that they showed to Al Gore during the 2000 campaign (as opposed to the fawning coverage that Bush received from Frank Bruni in, of all places, The New York Times) or the non-coverage of Bush's financial misdeeds as opposed to the massive coverage of Clinton's non-existent &quot;crimes&quot; concerning Whitewater, the press has chosen to cravenly cave in to the Republican line.<br />&quot;Unbeknownst to millions of Americans,&quot; writes Alterman near the end of this book, &quot;who continue to believe that the media are genuinely liberal -- or that conservatives and liberals are engaged in a fair fight of relative equality -- liberals are fighting a near-hopeless battle in which they are enormously outmatched by most measures.&quot;  If you've been watching Fox's &quot;fair and balanced&quot; coverage you might not believe this at first, but Alterman makes a strong and convincing case.<br />This is an important book that needs to be read.  Because it's long and takes the time to thoroughly make its case (and in small type, yet), I doubt that one person will read this book for every ten who read Ann Coulter's imbecilic &quot;Slander.&quot;  But people need to read Alterman -- as they need also to read Joe Conason and Paul Krugman and Al Franken.  As opposed to the flamethrowing rhetoric on the right, these people have the facts on their side.  It's time you knew the facts.	2003-09-09

Having been spared the carnage of the Great War due to his defective eyesight (which probably saved his life -- remember that 60,000 young Englishmen were killed in the Battle of the Somme in one day), he epitomized the weary, cynical post-war mood of the post-War 1920s in novels such as \\"Crome Yellow\\" and \\"Antic Hay\\" (the latter of which, all 100,000 words, was written in two months).  These books were admired by fellow authors (among them F. Scott Fitzgerald, who would portray Huxley, who by that time had moved to Hollywood, as the author \\"Boxley\\" in his last, unfinished novel \\"The Last Tycoon\\").<br />But Huxley turned towards mysticism and theology as he aged, helped, no doubt, by his move to California in the late 1930s.  Instead of having friends like D.H. Lawrence (whose letters he edited), he instead began hanging out with Hollywood celebrities like Charlie Chaplin and Harpo Marx -- the latter of whom he once regaled with the idea of the Marx Brothers making a film about Marxism with Groucho playing Karl (Harpo didn't realize that Huxley was teasing, telling him that such an idea would never fly in Hollywood).  His biggest credit as a screenwriter was the M-G-M adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" with Laurence Olivier as Mr. Darcy.<br />His later books, such as \\"Ends and Means\\" (much admired by the American monk Thomas Merton) and \\"The Doors of Peception\\" (which would inspire the name of the famous rock band fronted by Jim Morrison) would chart his spiritual quest, which would eventually involve Huxley's experimentation with such drugs as Mescalin and LSD.<br />It's a fascinating life, and the author tells it well, feeling free to be considerably more frank about the Huxleys and their marriage then was Huxleys previous biographer, Sybille Bedford (perhaps because Bedford had aparently bedded both of the Huxleys).  The author is hampered to some extent due to the fact that a considerable amount of Huxley's papers were destroyed in a fire in the early 1960s, but he manages to tell the story of Huxley's long and interesting life in such a way that makes you want to hit the library and find some of his books.<br />You know, for a literary biography, you can't ask for much more than that.	2003-08-30
US	47672944	RW39ZGAAMDY1K	0743222245	376327637	Living History	Books	2	8	12	N	N	A bland telling of an interesting life	Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has written (or, to be pedantic about it, has put her name on) a book that I'm fairly sure will infuriate her enemies, disappoint her friends, and bore to tears nearly everyone else.<br />How can this be?  Hillary Clinton, no matter what you think of her (and in the interest of full disclosure I should mention that I voted for her once for Senator and her husband twice for President) is a smart and capable woman who has had, to put it mildly, an interesting life.  So why is she seemingly incapable of making that life sound interesting?<br />The problem, I believe, is twofold.  First, the Senator has had, as she candidly admits, \\"a lot of help\\" writing her book -- almost certainly too much.  Anywhere from 60 to 85% of this decidedly impersonal autobiography sounds like it could have been written by someone who never met Senator Clinton.  And an impersonal autobiography is, or at least should be, a contradiction in terms (although there are people who have pulled it off, most notably Julius Caesar and Henry Adams).  <br />Secondly, Senator Clinton is a lawyer, and by all accounts an excellent one.  Unfortunately, she writes like a lawyer.  Too much of the book sounds like a legal brief rather than a life story - her prose style (or that of those who gave her \\"a lot of help\\") is smooth, polished, functional and decidedly bland.  You never really get a sense of urgency, of passion -- even when she writes about falling in love with her husband, it's with the robotic tone of a Stepford Wife.  It's either highly ironic or incredibly revealing that the only time Senator Clinton's prose generates any heat at all is when she discusses Kenneth Starr.  Not that there aren't interesting things in the book -- it's just that the part of the text that sounds like it could only have been written by Hillary Clinton amounts to, at best, 15% of the total.  The rest of the book feels like it's on autopilot. <br />The main problem with \\"Living History,\\" itseems to me, is that it needed to be either a long longer or a lot shorter.  The early, pre-Bill Clinton years are dispensed with pretty perfunctorily, and there are many occasions where important matters are dispensed with in a paragraph, or even a clause, that should have been given a lot more space.  Conversely, she seems to feel the need to discuss at length every foreign trip she ever took and every foreign leader (and, naturally, their spouse) that she met on those trips.  She also feels compelled to mention by name every person who has ever worked for her in any capacity.  It gets a bit tiresome -- at points reading like nothing so much as an overlong Academy Awards speech.<br />This is a book only a policy wonk could love, and for all the hundreds of thousands of people who have bought and will buy it, I doubt that one reader in twenty will stick it through to the end.  While it has some good things in it (the scene on pages 394-95 where the 95-year-old Strom Thurmond starts hitting on the 16-year-old Chelsea Clinton at an official function is priceless), overall reading it was a bit of a chore.  Not an experience I would recommend, unless you're very earnest, don't mind plowing through some very dull prose and you're obsessed with public policy.  In other words, it sounds like the only person who would get anything out of reading \\"Living History\\" is Hillary Clinton herself.  The rest of us should probably give it a pass.	2003-06-22

After all, it's not like the subject is uninteresting. Snobbery, class distinctions, social climbing -- whatever you want to call it -- has inspired some exquisite prose by some wonderful writers. Thackeray, Proust, Veblen and Paul Fussell have all had sharp and witty things to say about the topic of trying to impress your betters and look down on your equals.<br />That's when it hit me. The essential vapidity of this book rests in the fact that its author is only regurgitating what others before him have said in a far wittier fashion. In particular, Paul Fussell's book \\"Class\\" (which Epstein, mendaciously, doesn't include in his \\"Bibliographical Note\\"), a far better guide to this subject, and one from which Epstein has clearly cribbed.<br />If you're interested in the whole realm of social class and social climbing, there are far more intriguing books to choose from. Try Proust's \\"In Search of Lost Time\\" if you're ambitious, or Thorstein Veblen's \\"The Theory of the Leisure Class.\\" Or William Makepeace Thackeray's \\"The Book of Snobs,\\" or any of his novels, for that matter. Or Paul Fussell's \\"Class.\\" <br />But Joseph Epstein's book takes an endlessly fascinating subject and make it seem, well, tedious. Try Fussell instead. He may infuriate you, but at least you won't be bored.	2003-06-08

This is a shame, because its reputation as the Ultimate Big Massive Tome has, unfortunately, obscured the fact that it tells a very gripping story and is infinitely rewarding and re-readable.<br />I'm in a position to say this because I've read this book anywhere from half-a-dozen to a dozen times (to be honest I've lost count).  For many years I would read one of Tolstoy's big novels every year, alternating between \\"War and Peace\\" and \\"Anna Karenina.\\"  Along the way I've read three of the four major translations of the book multiple times.<br />The four translations, in order of appearance, are:<br />1) Constance Garnett<br />2) Louise and Alymer Maude<br />3) Rosemary Edmonds<br />4) Ann Dunnigan<br />Of these four translations, I would recommend either Edmonds or Dunnigan.  Here's why.  The Garnett and Maude translations date from the first three decades of the 20th Century.  Edmonds' translation was originally published in 1957, and Dunnigan's in 1968 (for some reason, no one has tried to come up with a new translation of \\"War and Peace\\" in the past 35 years).  The definitive (to date) Russian text of the novel was published in the early 1960s: Edmonds revised her translation in 1978 to take into account the new version.<br />In general, unless you're reading an older translation, not for the sake of its putative author but for the translator (which is the only reason to read, for example, the Urquhart-Motteux Rabelais or Chapman's Homer), you're almost always better off sticking with a modern translation.  And that's the case with \\"War and Peace.\\"  It's either Edmonds or Dunnigan.<br />It's a close call.  You really won't go wrong with either one of them.  If I prefer Dunnigan, it's because Edmonds' translation is a wee bit too English for my taste.  Having Russian peasants sound like Cockneys just doesn't work for me.<br />Can you really read such a lengthy book?  Keep in mind that it's not all that long -- it's only around 800,000 words and both Proust and Gibbon are much longer.  Plus, when you get past all of Tolstoy's interpolated essays on History (which you can easily skip the first time around, although they are interesting), what you're left with is a stirring story about a few Russian families struggling for survival during Napoleon's invasion of Russia.  Tolstoy put into the book thinly veiled versions of his parents and relatives (and they are very thinly veiled -- the Volkonskys become the Bolkonskys), and there are quite a few inside jokes that will go sailing over your head the first time you read it.<br />(I'll only give away one -- when Princess Maria sticks her head out of her room while the Little Princess is about to give birth to Prince Andrei's son, she sees some servants carrying a leather sofa into the Little Princess's room.  Tolstoy never says anything else about it, and never explains it.  The fact is that Tolstoy himself was born on a leather sofa, and he insisted that his wife give birth to all of his many children on the same sofa.)<br />So don't be afraid of this very long novel, which Henry James once unwisely referred to as a \\"loose baggy monster.\\"  In fact it is nothing of the sort.  It takes quite a few readings of \\"War and Peace\\" before you realize how brilliantly structured it is -- how something that seems at first glance as natural and casual as water flowing downstream is really meticulously and artfully plotted.<br />I hope I've talked you into at least taking a crack at this book.  Unlike Proust, who has to be read incredibly slowly if you're going to get anything at all from him, \\"War and Peace\\" can be taken at a gallop.

His view of the period, however, is both idiosyncratic and incomplete - you'd be hard pressed to realize from Harvey's account, for example, that directors as disparate as Samuel Fuller and Vincente Minnelli were doing some of their best work in the 50s.  Some great films of the era -- Minnelli's \\"Some Came Running,\\" for example -- go unmentioned here.  <br />When Harvey is intrigued by a director, such as Nicholas Ray, Robert Siodmak or the currently trendy Douglas Sirk, his analysis can be enthralling (his take on Sirk's \\"Imitation of Life\\" alone is worth the price of the book).  But as well as being a little uncertain factually (he has Marilyn Monroe and James Dean dying, respectively, a year earlier and later than they actually did), too many pages are devoted to meandering plot summaries of films all-too-readily available on video.  <br />All told, the book is worth checking out, but you might want to do some judicious skimming.	2003-06-03

Wilson has done a creditable job of it in \\"The Victorians.\\"<br />From the Crimea to South Africa, from Tennyson to Oscar Wilde, Wilson has an enormous span of time and space to cover, and he more or less pulls it off. I say \\"more or less\\" because in any book of this size there are bound to be sins of omission. <br />For example: Wilson admirably discusses both Prince Albert and the impact of the American Civil War on the British, who were for the most part pro-Confederate, due to England's reliance on cotton produced by the slave-owning South. Yet he completely ignores the Trent Affair, one of the most dramatic incidents of the Civil War that didn't take place on a battlefield. Two Confederate diplomats en route to England were forcibly taken off a British ship and imprisoned in the North. The British public was in an uproar, and it took the intervention of Prince Albert, then on his deathbed, to find a peaceful solution (the North returned the diplomats) and prevent England from going to war with the United States for the third time in a century. Had this incident gone the other way, it might have altered the outcome of the Civil War.  There isn't a word of this in the book.<br />What is in the book, however, more than makes up for its omissions. Some of his conclusions seem to be a little far-fetched, and I grew a little tired of his incessantly referring to us, his readers of \\"the twenty-first century\\" (a phrase that he repeats with mind-numbing regularity). And I would have liked to hear more about the giants of the Victorian novel (you won't read much about Thackeray or Trollope here, which is a shame).  <br />But these are tiny complaints about a book that gets a lot of things right on a very large canvas. So if you have any interest at all in the Victorian era, I would say that this book is well worth your time.  And it might inspire you to read more about this fascinating period in British history.	2003-05-28

Such 50s classics as &quot;The Steel Helmet&quot; and &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; made Fuller, along with Nicholas (&quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;) Ray a favorite of the Cahiers du Cinema crowd.<br />But Fuller was more than just a director.  He had been a newspaperman in New York's tabloid era of the 20s and 30s.  He was an infantryman on Omaha Beach on D-Day.  He had met just about everyone worth meeting -- from Charlie Chaplin to Al Capone.  And he is, as his autobiography &quot;A Third Face&quot; most eloquently demonstrates, a magnificent storyteller.<br />The section of the book dealing with Fuller's experiences in World War II make for amazingly gripping reading -- and I would like for people like Donald Rumsfeld to take a gander at Fuller's account of what warfare is really like before they send young Americans into combat any time soon.  Fuller writes about war in all its hallucinatory insanity (as he waded through the blood and body parts to get onto Omaha Beach he saw a man's mouth -- just his mouth -- floating in the water), and it's not a story you're likely to forget.<br />His exploits in Hollywood, while not as gripping, are equally fascinating.  Fuller clearly pines for the old days when moguls like Darryl Zanuck would protect a writer's vision and a deal could be counted on even if it was only a handshake.  And while Fuller made his share of career mistakes (he turned down both &quot;The Longest Day&quot; and &quot;Patton,&quot; for example), his filmography is an eloquent tribute to a man who wanted to make his films his way -- no matter what the cost.<br />The book is not perfect, though.  It is marred by many factual errors (to give just one example, he discusses meeting French film critic Andre Bazin at a time when Bazin had been dead for years), and at times he seems suspiciously eager to belie his reputation as a right-wing filmmaker.  His use of language can get a little repetitious (if I had a dollar for every time he uses the word &quot;yarn&quot; in this book I could buy everything on my Wish List), and I found myself wondering just how much of the text had actually been written by Fuller's wife, Christa (one of two credited co-writers), and not by its putative author.<br />All those reservations aside, this is a book that will keep you up late (that is, if I'm any indication -- I finished it at dawn), and that truly earns the description of &quot;impossible to put down.&quot;  You should put it on your bookshelf alongside Frank Capra's great (and equally inaccurate) &quot;The Name Above the Title.&quot;  Assuming that you don't take the author's word for gospel, and you're willing to accept the fact that he will never let the facts get in the way of a good story, it's an engrossing and unforgettable read.	2003-05-06

In her book Slander, Ann Coulter portrays all contemporary political discourse in America as \\"insufferable\\" and \\"a nasty sport.\\"  The responsibility for this, she alleges, lies solely with liberals.  Liberals are \\"bitter and angry,\\" they \\"hate America\\" with \\"a species of primitive religious hatred.\\"  Their \\"idea of political debate\\" is \\"ad hominem attack,\\" and a \\"central component\\" of their \\"hate speech is to make paranoid accusations based on their own neurotic impulses.\\"  Intriguingly enough, though, the more Coulter describes liberals as hate-filled, bitter and neurotic, the more they come off sounding remarkably like Ann Coulter.<br />Coulter's cartoonish Manichaeanism might be easier to take if it was supported by rational argument, but Coulter is to rational argument what Jackson Pollock was to painting - she just splatters invective in all directions and hopes that some of it hits the canvas.  She does score an occasional hit (after all, as Gibbon once put it, \\"faction exaggerates, rather than invents\\"): her description of how serial tongue-prober Bob Packwood was depicted by the press before and after his fall from power has the ring of truth about it.  And her advocacy of Phyllis Schlafly as an unjustly neglected intellectual is an intriguingly heterodox position which makes me want to see if Schlafly really is the towering intellect that Coulter depicts.<br />Coulter's own prose style is serviceable without being flashy.  She uses the term \\"hoi polloi\\" correctly more than once, which always impresses me.  But she repeats points over and over again, as if she believes that her ideal reader is a mental defective with a short attention span who needs to be hit over the head several times before they get the point.  It's not enough for Coulter to claim that Ronald Reagan \\"won the Cold War\\" (a dubious enough assertion in any event) - she has to say it eight times.  She is also addicted to the word \\"starlet,\\" which she tosses around like Hedda Hopper in her heyday (at one point four times on the same page).  Her contempt for women who are more attractive than she is knows no bounds, and one gets the feeling that Coulter thinks that a person should lose all right to express themselves politically once they've received a SAG card (Charlton Heston, I suppose, would get an exemption). Ironically, Coulter reveals less of herself and her opinions when she bellows than when she attempts to understate, as when she refers to the Wall Street Journal as a \\"conservative\\" - in quotes - newspaper, or when she posits that \\"Fox News may modulate slightly to the right\\" (she also refers to Washington Times writer Tony Blankley as \\"telegenic,\\" at which point we enter the realm of science fiction).<br />Coulter in her endless interviews, when she's not bemoaning the fact that Timothy McVeigh didn't blow up the New York Times instead of the Murrah Building, tends to take great pride in the fact that her book has oodles of footnotes when in fact it has none (she is to be congratulated, however, for having made it through law school without learning the difference between a footnote and an endnote).  Her endnotes are revealing, however.  The number of actual books read and cited is depressingly skimpy - most of what evidence Coulter has accumulated has come from trolling through the electronic database Lexis/Nexis - which, incidentally, is too expensive to be accessed by the general public.  I suppose it could be a coincidence that Coulter has seen to it than none of her readers will be able to check up on her references unless they're in what conservatives refer to suspiciously as the \\"mainstream media,\\" but I tend to doubt it.           <br />She pours disdain on liberals who referred to Ronald Reagan during the 1980s as \\"dumb,\\" in spite of the fact that Norman Podhoretz left his first meeting with Reagan \\"wondering whether he had any brains at all\\" (the quote can be found on page 618 of Stephen F. Hayward's book The Age of Reagan).  She condemns former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara for \\"losing\\" the Vietnam War (which ended seven years after he left the government) and \\"condemning millions of people to live under a communist tyranny,\\" when a celebrated Republican president did exactly the same thing.  Coulter states that \\"Truman got the country into a war in Korea, and couldn't get us out for two and a half years.  Eisenhower was elected and ended the war in six months.\\"  The fact is that Truman, when faced with Communist aggression, went to the UN and assembled a multinational coalition to stop that aggression - actions that conservatives tend to approve of, so long as they're being done by a Republican whose surname is Bush.  Eisenhower, on the other hand, was so anxious to bug out of Korea that he blackmailed South Korea's President into acquiescing to a stalemate that handed half his country over to the Communists by threatening to withdraw all American troops immediately if he didn't accept the truce.  As a result the war never officially ended, 37,000 American troops are stationed in Korea to this day, and 22,000,000 people (North Korea's current population), are, as Coulter put it when discussing Robert McNamara, condemned \\"to live under a Communist tyranny.\\"  Even Stephen Ambrose admits that, had President Truman tried to end the war under the same terms, the Republicans in Congress would have tried to impeach him.     <br />To quote that well-known Freudian Peggy Noonan in her most recent book on Ronald Reagan, \\"A lot of people have a way of projecting their own flaws, their own sins, onto others.  They see in others the transgressions they themselves routinely commit.\\"  The more you read Slander, the more it becomes obvious that Coulter's book is nothing more or less than a 256-page-long exercise in projection, and in the final analysis, her career is nothing more than conclusive proof of how far you can go in this country with a maximum of self-promotion and a minimum of class.	2003-04-29

He was also one of the worst alcoholics of that notoriously hard-drinking era. It made for a short and unhappy life, but a productive one. Crane wrote some of the most brilliant (and difficult) poetry ever written by an American.<br />Fisher isn't much of a literary critic, and his attempts to explicate such notoriously knotty texts as \\"The Bridge\\" are not notably incisive. But when it comes to telling the story of a tawdry but fascinating life, he does a tremendous job. While much of Crane's literary remains were destroyed by his termangent of a mother after his suicide in an attempt to sanitize his reputation, Fisher has found enough to flesh out the picture of an unhappy, self-educated man with a passion for poetry, alcohol and rough trade into an absorbing, if somewhat depressing, narrative. Mariani's is the shorter book of the two, and I'd still recommend it highly, but I think Fisher's is the one to go to if you want to know what this man was all about. <br />The book does have its flaws, though. Fisher mentions Crane's famous Greenwich Village meeting with Charlie Chaplin (the subject of Crane's poem \\"Chaplinesque\\"), but seems not to realize that Chaplin described the meeting himself in his \\"Autobiography\\" and even quoted the poem in full (Fisher's bibliography doesn't list Chaplin's book). Also, on page 193 Fisher inaccurately refers to Chaplin's film \\"A Woman of Paris\\" as \\"A Woman of Darkness.\\"<br />These minor caveats aside, however, I would recommmend this book to anyone who is curious about the life and work of one of America's finest poets.	2003-04-15

It is an entertaining and readable book, if you can get past the fact that it is essentially right-wing propaganda.<br />Hayward writes an engaging, entertaining prose style, and given how large a story he has to tell, I'm impressed by how well he's marshalled his material. It is a gripping read.<br />Whether you like the book, I suppose, will depend on where on the political spectrum you fall. If you're a right-wing conservative (the kind who thinks that Fox News is \\"fair and balanced\\" and the New York Times is published by a bunch of Commie homosexual perverts), then you'll love this book. If you're an unreconstructed McGovernite, or if you fall somewhat to the left of Dick Cheney, you're likely to be annoyed by it.<br />I enjoyed the book but found myself strenuously disagreeing with it more often than not.<br />Nor is Hayward's book free from errors. He claims that John Maynard Keynes was on the cover of Time magazine in 1967 when it was 1965. He refers to Shirley MacLaine, who at the time was 40 and a former Oscar nominee, as a \\"starlet.\\" And on page 526 he buys at face value Reagan's ludicrous story that the taxes during WWII were so high that he could only afford to make one film a year (a trip to the imdb could have told him that in 1940, 41 and 42 Reagan made no less than sixteen films). He also mistakenly attributes the saying \\"whom the gods would destroy they first make mad\\" to Aeschylus rather than Euripides (which probably means he got it through the Latin version quoted by Plutarch rather than the Greek original).<br />This is a fun read -- a good story well told. But it's also an annoying tract of blatant right-wing propaganda. I don't regret having read it, while at the same time I have to admit that I find his analysis shallow and based more on ideology than anything else. If you're not a right-wing ideologue, and lived through the era, it might be worth your while to have an Hegelian dialectic with this book, if only so you can disagree with it.<br />But if you *didn't* live through the era, or if you want something that purports to be objective, I wouldn't recommend this book.	2002-09-05

For years I was put off by the Modern Library's 1961 edition of Ulysses, and with good reason. When Judge Woolsey decided in the 1930s to institute what Morris Ernst decreed \\"the New Deal in the law of letters,\\" making Ulysses legal to own and distribute in the U.S. (before that it was contraband, smuggled into the country as if it was bootleg scotch by, among other people, Ernest Hemingway), Random House, which had locked up the U.S. rights, decided to act fast, while the book was hot (Joyce even made the cover of Time magazine). So they rushed their now-legal version into print as quickly as possible, using in the process the ugliest, most unreadable typeface known to man.    In 1961, they revised the text, getting rid of some obvious errors (if I'm not mistaken they were in such a rush originally that they used Samuel Roth's 1927 pirated edition as copytext!), but for some reason they kept the same repellent font, probably because resetting the whole book in a new font would have been too expensive.    When I finally read Ulysses complete, it was in the 1960 Bodley Head edition, which is miles ahead of its American counterpart in elegance and readability. Unfortunately, the text is not nearly as good (Joyce scholar Hugh Kenner's comment on it is particularly apt -- suffice it to say that it's the title of Jacobean playwright John Ford's most famous work).    So if you're planning on taking a stab at Ulysses, this is what I would suggest. Forget about the Vintage Paperback edition (as well as Hans Walter Gabler's so-called \\"Corrected Text,\\" for textual reasons too cumbersome to get into here), and go with the Everyman's Library hardcover. It may not be ideal (contrary to what I thought at first, they reprint the Bodley Head edition and not the ModernLibrary 1961 text), but it's published in a large and reader-friendly font. It's the edition to get if you've never tried Ulysses before (although Dover has recently put out a reproduction of Shakespeare and Co.'s 1922 First Edition that's worth looking into).     And if you haven't read Ulysses before, I would suggest that before you do, you: a) read Joyce's earlier and simpler novel, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, b) try a biography first (Richard Ellmann's is the authoritative one, especially in its 1982 revision, but I'm rather partial to Stan Gebler Davies' shorter biography from the 1970s, which sounds like it was written by a character in Ulysses).  Also: c) find and read a good commentary first, such as Edmund Wilson's chapter on Joyce in Axel's Castle, or Hugh Kenner's book, entitled Ulysses or Harry Blamire's The Bloomsday Book. If you're a Joycean newbie, you will need help. Plenty of it.     Even then it won't be easy. But Joyce, with the possible exception of Proust, wrote the greatest novel of the last century, and if you're any kind of a serious reader you really owe it to yourself to take a whack at it. Clifton Fadiman once compared reading Ulysses to climbing Mount Everest. Not many people make it to the summit, but the ones who get to the top are afforded a view that's hard to beat. Reading Joyce is less a matter of reading a book than of having a life experience, and a precious one (although some might wonder in which sense of the word) at that. Good luck.	2002-03-01

God knows what things are like for the waitresses, housecleaners and Wal-Mart \\"associates\\" today. But I'm glad that Barbara Ehrenreich made her experiment in downward mobility, and came back to tell the tale. My only real reservation is that the conclusions in her final chapter don't seem to dig deep enough, and that she seems more interested in patting herself on the back (\\"I think it's fair to say that as a worker, a jobholder, I deserve a B or maybe B+\\") than extrapolating from her personal experience to reach wider conclusions. But it's a small flaw in an otherwise fascinating book.	2002-02-22

She can also be more than a little self-righteous.  Both tendencies are on display in Canaries in the Mineshaft, her new book on politics and the media.<br />Primarily what they call in journalism a &quot;clip job&quot; of old articles, Adler shows a real joy in going for the jugular in some of these pieces.  Her articles on the Starr Report and Monica Lewinsky's autobiography are truly biting.  You'll be hard pressed to see Ken Starr the same way again after Adler's indictment.<br />Included as well is Adler's 1980 hatchet job on Pauline Kael, House Critic (originally entitled The Perils of Pauline when it ran in The New York Review of Books).  You don't have to admire Kael (as I do, with reservations) to think that Adler is making a mountain out of a molehill here.  The final article A Court of No Appeal, is Adler at her most insufferably self-righteous.  Even though she might have a case, her argument is always simplistically Manichaean -- everyone else is wrong and I'm right.  Always.<br />So this book is a mixed bag.  I can't wholeheartedly recommend it (if you're a Conservative Republican you're liable to drop dead of apoplexy by page 159), but Adler's insights and deliciously vicious style make up for her not-unoccasional smugness.	2002-02-22

Early on, though, Frum forfeits all credibility as a social prognosticator. \\"America at the beginning of the twenty-first century,\\" he writes, \\"is rich beyond all reckoning... And unlike any previous great power... Americans can see nobody and nothing on the horizon who would dare to take, who could even imagine taking, all this away from him.\\" Has anyone ever been proven so wrong so quickly? This statement must rank with Neville Chamberlain's claim of having achieved \\"peace in our time\\" for rampant idiocy.<br />As for the book as a whole, it's a mess, strangled by its own ideological blinders, and it's filled with errors, large and small. Frum likes to pose as an expert on pop culture, but gets nearly everything wrong: dates (he thinks Kramer Vs. Kramer came out in 1978 instead of 1979, and Network in 1975 instead of 1976), plot points (on page 13 he misreads the opening of The Godfather, and turns John Shea in Costa-Gavras's Missing into Jack Lemmon's daughter, instead of his son) and categories (he thinks that the Best Supporting Actress Oscar is for the lead role in a film).<br />Being a Canadian, he also makes factual and nomenclatural errors that a native would spot instantly (and that his proofreaders -- if he had any -- should have caught). He thinks on page 226 that Brooklyn was a borough before 1898, when it merged with Manhattan to make Greater New York (the borough usage only came into effect afterwards -- before 1898, Brooklyn was its own city), and believes that Americans \\"queue\\" instead of getting in line (on line, if you're a New Yorker). He also misuses the possessive, and talks about \\"Richard Nixon's Supreme Court\\" (on page 18) and \\"Meryl Streep's filmed biography of Silkwood\\" (on page 129).<br />The proofreading is atrocious. One can understand his misspelling Götterdämmerung (on page 328), but how do you explain the \\"Delaney\\" Amendment becoming the \\"Delancy\\" Amendment on the same page (page 127)? Sheer sloppiness. My favorite blunder is on page 336: \\"By the end of the century, one out of every American babies would be born to an unmarried woman.\\" One out of what? If a writer gets so many small things so hopelessly wrong, how can you expect to trust him when he goes in for sweeping analysis? <br />The answer is, obviously, that you can't. And Frum's analysis is predictably simpleminded. He blasts Janet Reno for \\"taking responsibility\\" for the Waco debacle without doing the honorable thing and resigning (on page 136), but doesn't mention that one could accuse Ronald Reagan for doing the same thing concerning Iran-Contra. He writes disparagingly of the Hare Krishnas on page 146 that \\"the price of this ecstasy was the surrender of one's critical faculties,\\" but when he comes to write about evangelical churches on page 154 (\\"...the churches that continued to grow after 1965 were precisely those that eschewed ritual and instead embraced the emotional, even the ecstatic\\"), he fails to make the obvious point that the evangelicals are doing exactly the same thing as the Krishnas. He points out on page 323 that \\"The well-to-do had to soar very high into the earnings stratosphere before they faced a marginal rate of more than 22 percent in the 1950s, and even then generous loopholes relieved the pain,\\" and contradicts himself on page 350, when he writes that \\"But would they pine for [the 1950s] if they remembered more clearly that the top rate of federal income tax was 90 percent?\\"<br />Frum's cartoonish conclusion boils down to this: Once upon a time in America, things were peachy. A good Republican named Ike was in the White House. Conservative Caucasians with penises ruled the country. America was a white nation that didn't let in any nasty dark-skinned immigrants. Women stayed at home and were barefoot and pregnant. Negroes knew their place. It was wonderful. Then the liberals came along and ruined everything. Kennedy and Johnson got us into Vietnam and ruined the economy. Women decided they had rights. So did Negroes and Homos. Everybody marched. It was awful. Nixon said he was a Republican but he was really a liberal. Ford too. Carter was the worst. Things had gone all to hell in this country. Kids couldn't pray in school the way God wanted them to. Women who'd been raped could get an abortion. Blacks could sit in the front of the bus. Who wants a country like that? Then came a man named Ronald Reagan on his big white horse, and he fixed everything. He cut money for those nasty welfare cheats and pumped billions into defense, where it belonged. Real men, conservative white men, were running the country again, and it was wonderful. So remember boys and girls, everything liberals do is bad. Everything conservatives do is good.<br />Now, if you get your information exclusively from Fox News, you're apt to agree with Frum's simple-minded analysis (assuming you can read at all, which is doubtful). But for those people who lived through the era and remember it, Frum is like a blind man trying to describe a Jackson Pollock painting. His knowledge is shallow, his erudition faked, and his conclusions are more a product of ideology than analysis. I wouldn't bother with this book.	2002-02-19

While the book isn't quite as anorexic as it appears (a word count would come out to roughly 75,000 words, helped by microscopic type), it has no index. You would think that an ostensibly serious book on public policy would have one, but you'd be wrong.<br />The prose style is simple (the cynical would say simple minded). Declarative sentences. Short ones. Avoid commas whenever possible. Write short. And snappy. With exclamation points!<br />Senator Wellstone seems to be addicted to exclamation points, which he tosses around like the chocolate sprinkles you'd put on an ice cream cone. It gets to the point where their overuse becomes unintentionally funny. <br />There are occasions where Wellstone writes well, usually when he is personally engaged with a subject. When he writes about his father (who died of Parkinson's) or his brother (who battled mental illness) his prose becomes sincere and heartfelt, and the exclamation points virtually disappear.<br />And I have to say that two of the final three chapters (Chapters 7 and 8) are much better than the first three, which sound like they were written by someone else entirely. Did Wellstone think he had to dumb-down the opening in order to get them to continue to read it long enough to get to the serious parts? Or did different members of his staff work on various sections of the book without consulting each other? I have no idea, but it certainly feels like different parts were written by different people.<br />Senator Wellstone is a potent figure in American politics, but this book is a poor introduction to his life and thought. While at least one chapter (\\"Democracy for the Few\\") is essential reading for anyone who wants to know how our government operates, it's not enough for me to recommend this depressingly skimpy book.	2002-02-05
US	47672944	R3EEFX1PZ0XMRG	0679423087	620361333	1-2-3: The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire: Volumes 1-3 of 6 (Everyman's Library)	Books	5	127	133	N	N	Gibbon's Masterpiece in a Readable Edition	These three volumes constitute the first half of Edward Gibbon's masterpiece. Many would-be readers will find reading Gibbon to be somewhat daunting, but his wit, scholarship, and narrative drive (in these early volumes, anyway) make this book hard to resist.<br />A word about the text. Everyman's Library reprints the famous J.B. Bury edition (Bury was a famous Irish historian who wrote a well-respected History of Greece), which is close to 100 years old (it dates to 1909). If you're reading Gibbon for a history course on an undergraduate or post-graduate level, you should probably read the more recent David Womerseley edition, which is available in a three-volume Penguin paperback (with, unfortunately, unreadably microscopic type). The hardcover edition was remaindered recently, though, so you might find it on Amazon secondhand.<br />If you're reading Gibbon for pleasure, however, the Everyman's Library edition is the one to get. The individual volumes are just the right size, and the text is large enough and clear enough to be read easily. The text is complete, which is not always the case (some fancy editions -- the Folio Society's comes to mind -- tend to cut back on the footnotes).<br />Gibbon makes great bedtime reading. Take him slowly, and don't rush. Keep your eye on the footnotes -- some of the best and snarkiest stuff in Gibbon is discreetly hidden in the footnotes (in one of my favorite early footnotes [in Chapter IV] he mentions the giraffe, \\"the tallest, the most gentle, and the most useless of the large quadrupeds.\\"). If you decide to push on to the second three volumes (Chapters 39-71), be prepared to be patient, because there are some rough spots. It might take you a while to get through it (my last reading of the entire work took me 26 months), but Gibbon is more than worth the effort. Which is why I've just started reading him again -- for the fifth time.	2002-01-15

Up front they tell you that the text of the book is taken from the first edition published in May of 1939. This is true, but it doesn't tell the whole story, and most people have no idea what it really means.<br />Finnegans Wake was originally published in 1939. The first edition was replete with errors and typos -- thousands of them. James Joyce spent the last two years of his life (he died in 1941) going through the text correcting the mistakes. An errata list comprising many single-spaced pages was printed in the back of the second edition, and the third edition had all of Joyce's corrections incorporated into the text.  So the third edition is the definitive one.<br />But Penguin is reprinting the first edition. Get it? The text you'll be reading will have all of the typos that Joyce spent two years correcting -- uncorrected.<br />Viking does have the third edition of Finnegans Wake in print. It's smaller, with smaller type and not nearly as pretty a cover, but it's the text that Joyce approved. I would get that one (it has a white cover with a green stripe going across the middle of it), and leave this edition alone.	2001-12-13
