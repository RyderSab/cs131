Large photos on every page should convince everyone of the joy of owning a pet - there are many pictures of children playing with their pets, illustrative photos of both children and adults cleaning cages, and much more.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even some of the pictures contain misinformation. For example, in the section on rabbits, the daily diet paragraph of text suggests \\"a handful of raw cabbage or a piece of celery should be plenty.\\" And the photo shows not only many vegetables that will cause gas, such as cauliflower, it also shows a big wedge of iceberg lettuce. As every well-informed rabbit owner knows by now, iceberg lettuce is useless nutritionally, high enough in water to possibly give your rabbit diarrhea, and leaf lettuce is a much better idea. Celery is likewise not a great idea - the strings in it have been known to get caught between teeth, which can lead to malocclusion, and some rabbits have even choked on them.<br /><br />The text for rabbits also suggests \\"stale crusts of whole-wheat bread\\" for treats. And the main advice for housing is an outdoor hutch, with barely a paragraph given to keeping your rabbit indoors as a house rabbit.<br /><br />Incidentally, the book was written in England, so although there appears to be an effort made to write in English that will be understandable to Americans, there are some items that are still likely to be confusing for American children: breed names for some rabbits and guinea pigs are different; food pellets are differently shaped and colored than most American brands, and so on. Also, it should be noted, the English background probably contributes to the author's preference for keeping rabbits outdoors. The climate in England does not have the extremes that the much larger North American continent has. The weather in Buffalo, NY would be far too cold to keep your rabbit in an outdoor hutch all winter, and the weather in San Antonio, TX, far too hot in the summer - rabbits would die of heat stroke. The English background also shows in the mention of chipmunks as an alternative small pet; in most of the US, chipmunks are not only not pets, but you'd need a specific wildlife permit to be allowed to keep one.<br /><br />The misinformation in the guinea pig section is just as extensive as the rabbit section. Again, vegetables are recommended that are known to cause gas, or to be nutritionally useless for guinea pigs, or to have caused other problems, and although the text briefly mentions that piggies need vitamin C, there is nothing at all pointing out which veggies and fruits are high in C. The emphasis, as with the rabbits, is on keeping guinea pigs in outdoor hutches, with barely a paragraph on indoor cages.<br /><br />I do not know as much about hamsters as I do about guinea pigs and rabbits, so I can't tell whether all the information in the hamster section is valid. However, the \\"healthy treats\\" section especially recommends yogurt drops - which are mainly sugar and are NOT a healthy treat for any pet, despite the \\"yogurt\\" in their name.<br /><br />There are some good points about this book: the great photos showing lots of interaction between kids and their pets, perhaps the book's strongest point. And for each pet, the section on toys and play has pictures of a great variety of toys, all of them appropriate for the pet, and many of them suggestions that an inexperienced pet owner wouldn't have thought of. Every pet has a lengthy section on seeing a vet, basic healthcare, signs of illness, and when to call a vet.<br /><br />It's difficult for anyone to try to write a short book that covers several animals. It's best for the potential pet owner to choose a book that is all about ONE species of pet, and contains more details about that particular animal than a scattershot book like this. I would also suggest that anyone looking for a good book on pets check the country of original publication, and lookfor a recent copyright date. For most Americans, although this book is brand new, copyright 2005, it does not meet the other requirements of being specific to one pet and being specifically written for US conditions.ication, and look for a recent copyright date.

Duke used to be a truck driver, till he ran over a werewolf. So these are not your debonaire, suave, bow-tied and caped supernaturals. They do not drink... wine - but they sure do drink beer. In a pick-up truck.<br /><br />There are so many funny bits in the book that I was constantly reading a line here, a paragraph there, aloud to my spouse.<br /><br />We have old gods with far more consonants in their names than Cthulhu (and possibly even more tentacles), not only ghosts but a ghost Scottie, and of course, the zombies. We have cows and chickens, and we also have the latest edition of the Necronomicon, which includes a spell for getting a three-picture deal with any major studio.<br /><br />There is despair in this diner, but it's not Edward Hopper's despair, that's for sure. Late nights in this diner are downright lively, or at least, undead-ly (though occasionally deadly - which contrast certainly points out some of the weaknesses of the English language.)<br /><br />Speaking of language, I do have one nit to pick: the author almost randomly uses \\"you're\\" for \\"your\\" and vice versa; sometimes he's right, sometimes not. A good copy editor would have caught this. Either our publisher needs to hire a copy editor, or our writer needs to brush up on some grammar, because I find it very distracting, and un-funny, to bump into mistakes like this so often.<br /><br />That said, I have two more words for y'all: Pig Latin.<br /><br />Optional family reading alert: scattered showers of four-letter words, casual teenage sex (not graphic) and blood and gore (sometimes graphic). They're all very funny, but some parents might not want their teenagers dipping into this, even though it's a light and funny read overall. Personally I had heard and read lots worse by the time I was 15, but it might be a little mature for a 13-year old. So call it a PG-13 book. As vampire books go, that's quite light!<br /><br />The plot is somewhat reminiscent of Tanya Huff's \\"Summoner\\" series, and I think people who enjoy Huff's fantasy would like this book. Likewise, if you read this and are then looking for something else to read, you might check Huff out. There seem to be some odd similarities between Huff's urban Canada and Martinez' rural desert south!mpire books go, that's quite light! <br /> <br />The plot is somewhat reminiscent of Tanya Huff's \\"Summoner\\" series, and I think people who enjoy Huff's fantasy would like this book.

US	53030634	RE2Z8Z493L9NL	0451460219	668758472	Buried Deep: A Retrieval Artist Novel (#4)	Books	5	8	9	N	N	the Retrieval Artist series gets better as we get deeper into alien customs	This series continues with a book in which we deal with the Disty and Humans, with only momentary glances at other species in Rusch's universe. This makes it easier to concentrate in detail on some fine points of the alien culture. It is also easier because the previous novels have established background; for that reason, I would tell someone just discovering Rusch that this is a series best read mostly in order, so go ahead and get all the books, not just this one first. Especially, one needs some background from the novel immediately preceding this one; if you can't pick them all up right away, at least get \\"Consequences.\\"<br /><br />That said, let's consider the part of the plot that is this volume's alone. Mainly, it centers on the death taboos and customs of the Disty, the alien race who control Mars. These customs are extensive and nearly incomprehensible to humans, and quite complex. Some reviewers have found that point hard to swallow, complaining that it's not believable. However, two points: one, even among humans alone, we have a rule that \\"ignorance of the law is no excuse\\" and we punish people for accidentally breaking laws they didn't know existed and that no one thought to tell them. This is true across any spread of human cultures you choose to contrast. And breaking customs of another country or culture that one wasn't informed about is also quite common among humans in the real world, to the extent that people attempt to write guides to such things and all of them are inevitably described as incomplete.<br /><br />Point two, the complexity and variation of the Disty death taboos and customs and rituals is not unbelievable; for an analogy, just look at the complex of laws we have surrounding marriage: thousands and thousands of different ceremonies and customs around the planet, millions of small details regarding what is expected of married couples, varying widely from religion to religion, and in the breakup of any marriage, every case varies enough to need individual adjudication, including dividing of property specific to the couple, child custody arrangements ditto, and so on. In other words, while the rituals themselves may not be comprehensible to us, and we may not agree with the Disty beliefs covering them, the number of strange, complex rituals the Disty have is quite believable, and that fact that one doesn't find out about them until a particular case occurs is something we already have experience of in human culture. (Let's try showing the Disty a Jewish wedding and a Mormon wedding, shall we, and explaining that both have to do with the same basic concept of two humans living together and probably producing offspring...)<br /><br />For those new to the series, probably the level of pickiness I went into above indicates the complexity of the series, and the fullness of Rusch's universe. These are real people, with personality quirks, interactions with other fully realized people, and so on. Perhaps the selfish reporter is a bit of a stereotype, but even she has her moments, where some insight is given into the legitimate motives that might have propelled her to become the kind of reporter she is.<br /><br />The development over time of the various domes on the Moon and on Mars, and how the various domes differ based on when they were built and what their original purposes were, are fascinating details of the \\"history\\" of this universe, and make for some fun speculation as to the stories behind those stories.<br /><br />And, alas, as I write this just after Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita, the details of government officials not cooperating with each other, not deciding who has authority over what, the lack of funding for Noelle's security position despite its importance, and the politicians not making decisions both for lack of authority and for fear of being blamed later, all ring far too true for comfort. As do the thousands of deaths that occur because one dome had no evacuation plan in place...<br /><br />I have only one complaint to make about this book: \\"search perimeters.\\" Miles, among others, is described as setting \\"search perimeters\\" for his computer searches. Perhaps, if we take a rather stretchy meaning of perimeter to mean limits or boundaries, that's what the author meant. Or maybe she misused perimeters, thinking that she was using the word \\"parameter.\\" Or, more likely, she wrote \\"search *parameters*,\\" a common enough phrase, and some automatic copy editing quirk somewhere changed it. No matter which of these it was, it makes for an uncomfortable pause as one tries to decipher: did she do this on purpose, or by accident, or is it the publisher's fault, and if she did it on purpose, why? So I have a suggestion for Ms. Rusch: so that we don't have to wonder about that, and can concentrate on your stories, please: if you mean search \\"terms\\" or \\"conditions\\" go ahead and use those words, and if you mean search \\"limits\\" use that word; avoid parameter altogether and don't use perimeter unless you really mean the edge of a physical area that someone is patrolling. That way, people can concentrate on the story.<br /><br />That said, I'm sure it will be fixed in the next edition of this volume, and hope it will be fixed in the next book in the series, which I am looking forward to and will definitely buy, because this continues to be a fascinating series.n plan in place... <br /> <br />I have only one complaint to make about this book: \\"search perimeters.\\" Miles, among others, is described as setting \\"search perimeters\\" for his computer searches.

US	53030634	RKSC15OOLWI6Z	0765308185	699827683	The Anvil of the World	Books	4	14	17	N	N	A very good read; it's not Pratchett and I'm just as happy	First, a word to people who are wondering \\"what's all this in so many reviews about Terry Pratchett? Who is that, and why does anybody care, when this book is not by Pratchett-whoever-that-is?\\" The comparisons to the author Terry Pratchett are a tempest in a teapot; because both this book and Pratchett's are fantasies based on slightly skewed parodies of our Earth, apparently some folks expected them to have exactly the same style. If you're not already familiar with Pratchett's style, you can disregard all this blather and skip to the stuff that's strictly about this book on its own merits. (Although, who knows, you might want to try Pratchett, too.)<br /><br />Okay, lots of people seem disappointed that this book isn't an identical clone of Terry Pratchett, judging by some of the other reviews. Get over it, people! Do you really want a world consisting only of Pratchett clones? Look at all the wretched imitations of Tolkein out there; do you want that? I am a Pratchett fan, but that's not the only stuff I read; I like other writing styles as well. In fact, I read this book the same week as I read \\"Going Postal.\\" I enjoyed them both, but they are both very different. I didn't expect them to be the same, and I wasn't disappointed. Kage Baker is starting from an entirely different place; her science fiction series about The Company is far more serious and more - \\"technical,\\" I guess. I read this book expecting more Kage Baker, but in a fantasy vein, and I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />Let me point out that there are some similarities: the world view that humans are often stupid and overlook the obvious; that many people who try to help others tend to offer theoretical help rather than practical help, and so they ain't much help (Willowspear's sudden realization: \\"I've been teaching them meditation, when I should have been teaching them gardening!\\"); the view that some of the other species of upright featherless bipeds in fantasy may well be a better lot than humans - not in the sense of good, wise, elves a la Tolkein, but in the sense of more practical, more able to see the consequences of their actions, be they trolls or demons.<br /><br />A few reviewers have commented on the rather extensive prologue, setting our stage. I liked it, and felt it was necessary; otherwise, later on, when Mrs. Smith is telling some of her history, you'd wonder why Smith doesn't already know a lot of this. You have to read the prologue to know that Smith gained Mrs. Smith sort of ad hoc as part of the family business, that she was a Mrs. Smith before she ever met him.<br /><br />This novel features Lord Ermenwyr, who has appeared in quite a few short stories. In this book, he is still a teenager. We also meet a couple of his brothers and a sister whom we have only heard about in other stories. We acquire far more background about his unusual parents. The older brother, Erdway, really is a dolt.<br /><br />Other things to like about this book:<br /><br />*real estate developers as incarnation of evil<br /><br />*supernatural cabbage moths<br /><br />*demons run insurance companies (does that really surprise you?)<br /><br />In short: it's not Kage Baker's Company series; it's funnier, and at least as well written. It's not Terry Pratchett; deal with it, you fanatics. It's an unusual fantasy with a happy ending and some inspired scenes along the way.mans - not in the sense of good, wise, elves a la Tolkein, but in the sense of more practical, more able to see the consequences of their actions, be they trolls or demons. <br /> <br />A few reviewers have commented on the rather extensive prologue, setting our stage.

US	53030634	R22W9AKZDYRSVQ	1556114702	822496867	Blood Muse: Timeless Tales of Vampires in the Arts	Books	3	1	1	N	N	inconsistent quality, a few very good stories	The stories in this book are of very uneven quality. A few of them appear to have been \\"phoned in\\" - someone told the author \\"vampires and the arts\\" and the author wrote any old thing that managed to mention a vampire and one of the arts and called it a story. Others have had some thought put into them.<br /><br />Generally speaking, there are a couple of ways to divide up vampire stories. The vampires are evil, brooding creatures who live to prey on humanity, or the vampires are good guys who use their supernaturally long lives to try and help along lesser beings; that's one way to categorize stories. Another is, the vampires have strictly the powers and weaknesses attributed to them by legend, or the author has taken the vampire general outline and made individuals with varying characteristics. Do the vampires feed on human blood, or do they prey on emotions, life force, or other features of the human soul? Still another way to categorize vampire stories is whether they are a blatant analogy for sex (penetration, blood, you know, the whole breaking-the-maidenhead, women-as-prey thing) or are more subtle, with metaphors for gaining knowledge, other stuff besides sex. The downside of short stories is that, since there are space limitations, authors usually don't have the space to get away from the cliche' side of these dichotomies, and so in most of the stories in this book, vampires are strictly the creatures of legend, evil, brooding, killing human prey, sunlight-is-deadly, afraid of garlic, etc. - by taking those things for granted, the author has time to develop a plot, whereas if the author of a short story tries to make a vampire an individual, there's not much room left for anything else.<br /><br />Other problems: in trying to get over 30 stories for the book, the editors stretched at authors; some are not familiar at all to readers of the fantasy/SF genre, and their writing is in a literary style that can be offputting.<br /><br />OK, all that sounds rather negative, so let me point out a few things I did like in this book:<br /><br />*\\"Fleadh de Deux\\" about an Irish vampire involved in the Irish traditional music scene, a different setting for a vampire! (Incidentally, several of the musical tales seem to feature flutes, which certainly adds to the thesis that many vampire stories are really about sex, since the flute is a pretty blatant phallic symbol.)<br /><br />*The story featuring Bela Lugosi, who turns down eternal life when offered it by a real vampire.<br /><br />*\\"Vamping the Muse\\" which features muses who are real little creatures who drink blood...<br /><br />*Most of the stories in the \\"Special Exhibits\\" section, which includes things that don't fit into the main categories of art such as music, dancing, or writing. For example, \\"Man of the Dead\\" features the art of jewelry-making, and is set in China. And \\"Beat Surrender,\\" featuring the art of graffiti murals.<br /><br />All that said, in summary, I'd buy this one used or paperback, as I didn't think the overall quality of the stories was worth hardcover, permanent-addition-to-the-collection. But, if you are a serious everything-vampire collector, you may find it worthwhile. It certainly does contain stories you won't find elsewhere.rather negative, so let me point out a few things I did like in this book: <br />*\\"Fleadh de Deux\\" about an Irish vampire involved in the Irish traditional music scene, a different setting for a vampire!

That's the main theme of the book. The other main theme is, well, it's a bunch of things.<br /><br />First off, for Pratchett fans who like to categorize this book: this is not a Watch book (though Captain Carrot makes a cameo appearance) or a Wizards/Unseen University book (although they do appear for a couple of chapters) or a Witches book - we don't see any of the witches at all - or a Death book (although Death also makes a cameo appearance); if you were going to categorize it, I guess you'd call it a Lord Vetinari/Ankh-Morpork book, since it's set mostly in the city, and most of the characters are city denizens (denizen being a far more accurate term for them than citizen). I'd say, in tone and story, it's closest to \\"The Truth\\" and in fact, some of our newspaper characters do show up in this one.<br /><br />Besides Hope (Hope may or may not be the thing with feathers, but feathers, specifically pigeon feathers, play an important part in the plot, so keep an eye out for them), the other thing to keep in mind while you read this book is \\"Te morituri salutamus.\\" (It's Latin, people. Look it up. Sheesh, what are they teaching kids in school these days? Speaking of which, \\"The Hedgehog Song\\" really needs to be rendered into Latin; singing \\"Rudolphus, nasum rubrum\\" is getting old.) In a way these are related, because hope is related to going down fighting.<br /><br />Other reviews have pretty well given most of the plot, so I'll just mention a few of the things I particularly like:<br /><br />* that Killer is a pretty natural nickname for a girl whose parents have named her Adora Belle Dearheart;<br /><br />* Devious Collabone, who is studying the mating call of the giant clam;<br /><br />* the cockatoo who shouts \\"Twelve and a half percent!\\"<br /><br />* Tiddles, the post office cat, who is set in his ways. (Path habits, is what this is known as. I read an article about the path habits of the water shrew: the first time they ever travel along a route, they hop over logs in the way, go around stones, etc. Therever after, when they come to that spot, even if the log is gone, they'll still hop there, if the rock is gone, they'll go around anyway, and if a new obstacle appears, they'll run headlong into it even if they see it.

I put Terry Pratchett's name in the title, as well as here in the first paragraph, so that those looking for certain keywords will come across this. I read Will Cuppy before I ever discovered Discworld (in fact, I read Will Cuppy's stuff before most of Discworld was ever written!) but though Cuppy's stuff is over half a century old, and non-fiction, it is nonetheless a natural fit for the sense of humor that appreciates Terry Pratchett.<br /><br />Will Cuppy was the master of the irrelevant footnote, the tangential digression, and the stern admonition to the reader. What makes it even funnier is that every word is true, or at least as much of the truth as was known in the 1930's and thereabouts. His specialty is zoology, which is what most of this book contains, but he also is very funny about history.<br /><br />Now, you don't have to read the Discworld novels to appreciate Cuppy, and so if you have no idea what I'm talking about, then never fear. You probably do need a bit of education, however; high school biology and Western history should be floating around in bits in the back of your brain. At the time he wrote these -essays?- Cuppy was writing mainly for The New Yorker magazine, and he assumed that his audience was somewhat elite, college-educated and highly literate. (However, he's not nearly as elitist, or as dead-white-male-centric, as, say, Hans Zinsser, whose \\"Rats, Lice and History\\" is also funny, but has some issues of racism and what some feel is anti-Semitism; Zinsser assumed his audience was educated at the sort of university where everyone was white, male, and required to study Greek and Latin and probably also knew French. Although Zinsser would also be a fun read for many, these issues make it a lot harder to recommend than Cuppy. However, if you've read this far in the review, and you want more words to read, more, more, more!, then you could consider \\"RL&H\\" as well.)<br /><br />Anyway, there's a double message in this review: if you enjoy Terry Pratchett, then you really need to read Will Cuppy to find where Pratchett got his style from, and if you enjoy Will Cuppy but have never tried Terry Pratchett because you don't read science fiction or fantasy, then give Pratchett a try anyway, because he writes like Will Cuppy. And if none of that made any sense, but you like animals, zoology, and/or Gerald Durrell, then Cuppy may also be your cup of tea. Especially if you like wombats.Terry Pratchett, then you really need to read Will Cuppy to find where Pratchett got his style from, and if you enjoy Will Cuppy but have never tried Terry Pratchett because you don't read science fiction or fantasy, then give Pratchett a try anyway, because he writes like Will Cuppy.

While the information presented above gives you what is nominally the first sentence of the book, that is actually the first sentence of an italicized abstract sort of prologue. The real first sentence of the book is this:<br /><br />\\"The sky was the color of a dead laptop display, silver-gray and full of rain.\\" Woo! I like that! The chapter titles are clever, too. While there's bits of foreshadowing, it's not heavy-handed.<br /><br />While the jacket blurbs compare Stross to Zelazny and H. Beam Piper, I am most reminded of Poul Anderson, perhaps because of the clear Viking/Nordic strain running through this rather medieval world. I would strongly recommend reading some of his old classics, if you aren't already familiar with them. Stross himself acknowledges Zelazny and Piper, but I don't see that much Piper in here, stylistically. More of the references to Piper are in incidental things - the fact that someone crosses the worlds at all, of course, and that the world she goes to is more primitive, but also the frequent references to Pennsylvania (you'll recall that Lord Kalvan was a Pennsylvania State Trooper), and the Sky-Father, Lightning-Child, Crone-Mother religion of this world resembles the figures that the first house Kalvan comes to worships. In other respects, however, there is no strong resemblance - unlike \\"Gunpowder God,\\" priests and religion are not the major players here.<br /><br />Since many other reviews have detailed the plot, I'll skip rehashing that, and simply mention a few more of the bits I particularly like:<br /><br />* the use of the phrase \\"Human Resources\\" as rather a dirty word;<br /><br />* the king who drinks because even he can't stand the family politics, and because he knows he's going to have to marry his son the idiot to some unfortunate girl;<br /><br />* Miriam brings Brill over to our world, and they get into a taxi:<br /><br />  \\"The cab moved off. Brill looked around in fascination, then reached down toward her ankles. 'It's *heated!' she said quietly.<br /><br />  \\"'Of course it's heated,' said the driver in a Pakistani accent. 'You think I let my passengers freeze to death before they pay me?'<br /><br />  \\"'Excuse my friend,' Miriam told him. 'She's from Russia. Just arrived.'\\"<br /><br />Family reading alert: there's a mild bit of sex, in no way intended to replace real plot or characterization - unlike some fantasy and SF books I've read lately, where sex replaces any real romance, covers up all kinds of plot discontinuities, and fills the book out. Perhaps as a result of this lack of unneccesary filler, the book is a little on the thin side, and it ends in the middle of the plot - luckily, the next book is already out. The bit of sex there is might make this a bit racy for younger teens who happen to be invading the adult-level science fiction section, as I was when I was 13, but it's no racier than most paperback romances, and a lot less racy than, say, the current crop of vampire novels, so it probably would be acceptable reading for older teens. And there's a heck of a lot less gore and four-letter language than most graphic novels. So if these things concern you, this book is fairly mild. (Unlike some of Stross's other stuff, which isn't.)<br /><br />Speaking of which, Stross has several different series running, and they don't all resemble each other that much. If you are expecting the bouncing-off-the-wall pace and skewed humor of Manfred Macx and the group-mind satellite lobsters, the style of this book will be a bit of a shock to you - it's quite different. At first, one might also feel it's slower, because it's notin that superfast, cyberpunk-on-Ritalin style, but in fact, there's quite a bit happening, quite quickly. So don't skip parts - you will miss things you need to know. You might also want to keep an index card handy to start sketching family relationships, because otherwise they could become hard to follow.<br /><br />In sum: call it alternate-history, although it's a little different; read some classic Piper and Anderson to increase your appreciation of the cultural references and feel like you'll be getting the inside nods to SF readers, and plan on getting hooked on the series.erpunk-on-Ritalin style, but in fact, there's quite a bit happening, quite quickly.

Let me give you the short version first:<br /><br />If you're looking for red-hot sex with a bit of fantasy/romance covering to make it semi-respectable, this may be just the thing you're looking for. If you're looking for a vampire novel, keep looking, 'cause this isn't even close.<br /><br />Now for the details: how this book stacks up as vampire novel, how it plays as fantasy in general, how it compares as a romance.<br /><br />As a vampire novel, it's a non-starter. Although our hero is called a vampire, he doesn't feel or act like one. Yes, he's got fangs and he sleeps during the day and he's long-lived. But he doesn't do anything he does because of these characteristics. There is nothing about him other than the plain mention of his fangs that would tell you he's supposed to be the same kind of creature as Jean-Claude, or Henry Fitzroy, or St. Germain. The plot does not in any way hinge on his being a vampire; although there's a magical transference of power involved, it could have been any other kind of magical creature as the plot gimmick, and it would have made no difference. I won't even bother with BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification, as I've used in other reviews, because despite the title and the back cover blurb, this ain't a vampire novel.<br /><br />Then, as a fantasy regardless of whether it includes vampires, it also fails. At least to my mind. Your tastes may vary; I've noted that there are different schools of thought about fantasy. Some people think that once they've given the willing suspension of disbelief necessary to read fantasy at all, that means there don't have to be any rules - anything goes. Others, myself among them, believe that fantasy still needs rules, albeit different ones from the \\"real\\" world. To suit me, there has to be an internal consistency, a theme, laws; stuff can't pop up out of nowhere with no precedent or reason. New types of magical characters can't be introduced out of nowhere; new powers can't come to a person without any effort to show how they are connected to or developed from previous powers or the efforts of the protagonist or others. That's my view, and I'm sticking to it. And this book mostly violates that view. Its major sin, to my eyes, is the way it mushes far too many disparate fantasy elements together - we have vampires and the Mageverse and fairies and Maja and Arthurian legend complete with Merlin and Lancelot only some of them are actually aliens... all sorts of characters from too many different areas of myth and fantasy. Speaking of myth, our author seems to believe that Sidhe is pronounced \\"side\\" and makes a pun on it that way; someone who is going to drag in Celtic myth ought to know that Sidhe rhymes with myth. She also attempts to connect the fantasy world and the \\"real world\\" in far too complicated a manner, with the FBI and the CIA and at least one invented federal agency, and with some of the FBI knowing about vampires but not others, and plots to trap the vampire in order to produce other vampires to be master spies for the US mixed in with the demon plot to destroy all the Mages and Majae. A vampire is a mage, by the way - that makes no sense at all in the usual uses of the terms vampire and mage, but then... Any minute, I expected to have a unicorn introduced out of nowhere and be told it's an alien and its horn is an electrical sensing organ - NO! Don't tell me! I don't want to know whether unicorns show up in another volume, because I suspect they'll make even less sense.<br /><br />Last but not least, romance. A few minor quibbles about our hero - Reece? Supposedly he's a few hundred years old and English, but Englishmen weren't named Reece back then; Rhys is a Welsh name and it would have been unlikely to the point of nonexistence for a Welshman to become a spy for the good of England. However, a much bigger problem with this \\"romance\\" is the overt and blatant text of \\"sex=power\\" and the only slightly moresubtle subtext of \\"woman gets power only when man enables/allows her to\\" that is demonstrated by human Latents such as Erin only being brought to their Maja powers if a Mage climaxes at least three times inside them. I mean, really. I'm pretty sure there's at least a short Women's Studies paper in here, about how modern romance novels that nominally feature strong career women with guns and brains are actually promoting traditional patriarchal pre-suffrage stereotypes and attitudes. It doesn't take a whole lot of deconstruction to see that the layer under the main text says \\"Woman not whole till she have sex with man! Woman's power not strong enough till man join minds!\\" And every other bit of side plot carries the same message, even in the incidental characters. Male fairy stronger and smarter than female fairy. (Insert Tarzan \\"ugh!\\" noise here.) Oh well, at least if you're going to write your Patriarchal Stereotypes in the Modern Novel paper this will be a more fun read than something literary would be.<br /><br />And oh yeah, FBI agents don't refer to themselves as cops.<br /><br />All that said, I should endeavor to mentions some good points. Let's see: I do like that Reece starts a business, once he's turned a vampire, so that all his descendents will have jobs. And I like that Merlin's Grimoire is actually a sentient character, nicknamed Grim. If there were more humorous bits like that, I'd like the book better - it'd be proof that the author doesn't take her own jumble quite so seriously as it seems.<br /><br />Summary: lots of sex; jerry-rigged construct of fantasy with cracking veneer of plot and cardboard characters. But lots of hot sex.ore subtle subtext of \\"woman gets power only when man enables/allows her to\\" that is demonstrated by human Latents such as Erin only being brought to their Maja powers if a Mage climaxes at least three times inside them.

The action doesn't let up in this one. Another major character's in the hospital before the previous one leaves. And pretty much every male in the book except Claude the gay fairy (no, that's not redundant) makes some sort of romantic overture to Sookie, and even he asks her for a personal favor!<br /><br />If you haven't read the previous book in this series, you should do that. I'll wait while you order \\"Dead to the World\\" (ISBN: 0441012183). There, back? OK, once you've caught up, you'll know that in that episode, Eric the vampire lost his memory, stayed at Sookie's place, and got real close. When he regained his memory, however, he did not remember any details of his interlude with Sookie. So...<br /><br />Sam's has a new cook - seems to happen almost every volume. Tara has a new boyfriend - also seems to happen regularly. But then the shooting starts:<br /><br />*Calvin Norris gets shot, seriously injured.<br /><br />*Sam gets shot, in the leg.<br /><br />*Sookie gets shot, a shoulder graze.<br /><br />*Dawson, a Were bodyguard, gets shot, seriously injured.<br /><br />And then, in terms of who's who vis a vis Sookie:<br /><br />*Calvin Norris is still interested in Sookie, and in fact they do get in a serious kiss, which surprises Sookie.<br /><br />*Claudine kisses Sookie a couple times, though, since she's Sookie's fairy godmother, what that might mean is ambiguous. Claudine certainly plays up a hint to others that it might be serious, when such a suggestion is useful.<br /><br />*Charles Twining, the new bartender at Fangtasia, is intensely interested in Sookie, although respectful.<br /><br />*Eric is still interested in Sookie, though he's not sure why, and he wants to find out what went on, and he does kiss Sookie again in this book.<br /><br />*Even good ol' Vampire Bill gets in a few licks, including sharing (innocently, this time) Sookie's hospital bed.<br /><br />*Alcide Herveax, the Were, attempts to continue his courtship of Sookie, sort of, escorting her to the sort of thing where other people will assume one's intentions are serious. (If you recall, they were once engaged for 10 minutes.)<br /><br />*And the one we've been waiting for - Sam kisses Sookie, and it might have gone further... yes, admit it, you've been expecting Sookie to finally realize that Sam more than just admires her as a barmaid for several volumes now!!<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest surprise for me what the sudden intersection with one of Harris's other series, a straightforward mystery series which has heretofore had no hints of fantasy. Lily Bard, who lives in Shakespeare, Arkansas, has been the heroine of such books as \\"Shakespeare's Christmas\\" and \\"Shakespeare's Trollop\\" and in this book she pops up, having finally married Jack Leeds (isn't that a great name for a PI? Leeds?) as they are investigating Debbie Pelt's disappearance. It's odd seeing Lily referred to as Lily Leeds, after years of seeing her as Lily Bard. Anyway, for those who have only been reading Harris's vampire books, now you are informed that those two characters, who pop up for a couple of chapters here, are actually a whole 'nother series, one I recommend to those who read non-fantasy as well as fantasy.<br /><br />Other fun bits to watch for - how Greg Aubert's insurance customers stay so lucky; Andy Bellefleur and Sookie finally air some things out; Quinn, who doesn't exactly... kiss... Sookie, and what kind of shifter he turns out to be.<br /><br />That should be enough teasers to get you all busy!<br /><br />And, for those just finding out about this series, a few notes on how it compares to the overall vampire genre, a/k/a BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification: What is the vampires' position in the world; do they stand as an allegory for women's sexual fears; what powers do the vampires have; are there other supernatural characters; is the author dead serious, if you'll pardon the pun, or have a sense of humor? The answers, in this case: The vampires in this series can be either good or bad guys. Most of them have jobs; they don't exist merely to be evil and brooding, unlike some series which shall remain unnamed. They do have extra powers; in general these powers include the usual super strength, and once undead, they live very long lives; they can sorta force people to do their will; they need invitations to enter a house; there's no turning into bats. They are good at sneaking off silently, sorta melting away, but no invisibility or seeping like smoke between walls. These vampires' taking of blood frequently involves sex, but doesn't have to; they do need human blood to survive, unlike some (P.N. Elrod's vampires can survive quite well on animal blood, for example) except for Bubba, who gets by on cats' blood - but then, Bubba is... different. There are many other species of supernaturals besides vampires, the most common of which are the Were and shifters. In this universe, Were is reserved for those who turn into wolves, and everyone else is a \\"shape-shifter\\" - except for the werepanthers in the tiny hamlet of Hotshot, who are a special and peculiar case. And yes, there's a lot of humor in this series. It's not farce; it's that the characters themselves have senses of humor.<br /><br />One of the things that I like about this series is that we get a fairly strong sense of \\"place\\" - it's very clear that we're in semi-rural Louisiana; we wouldn't mistake the setting for Cincinnati or Chicago if the author forgot to give us a name. There is a community and a background here, that have a life of their own even when the characters aren't doing much. I like that better than series such as Hamilton's, set in what is nominally St. Louis, but could be anywhere, since we never learn a single street name, a single detail about the social life other than our characters, or any idea of what else happens in that city. That's a personal preference - you may not care whether the setting is as fully realized as the characters. I feel it affects my opinion of how \\"realisticallly\\" the characters behave, at least within the degree of suspension of disbelief that we have to accept the fantasy at all.<br /><br />In short: a must if you're following the series, a good series to try if you like vampire novels that don't stick to evil, brooding creee-chures of ze niiiight, and it's also a good murder mystery.ys.

US	53030634	R3EGBQNIC1KKC0	0312301863	693950856	The Deserter: Murder at Gettysburg	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A very good historical, but not a mystery	This is a good book. But it's not really a mystery in the Homer Kelly series. Homer Kelly is an incidental character here. His wife Mary is somewhat more important. But the most part of the book takes place during the Civil War, and there's no mystery - we are told fairly quickly who murdered whom and why. The only mystery involved is Homer and Mary's finding out about it, and even that is not much of a mystery - everything is in the archives somewhere.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed the book a lot. Much of it is epistolary in style - letters written between the characters. I like that style. There are terrific photographs of the characters in the book who happen to be real people. There are some very funny moments featuring Mary's cousin-somewhat-removed (and somewhat loony), Howard Ebenezer. And at the end there is a bit of the humor aimed at the foibles of academia that often characterizes the series - but only a little bit, not enough to be annoying, as has happened in some of the other books.<br /><br />In fact, much of what has gotten a little trite or grating in the series is missing from this book, *because* Homer is only incidental to it. So many people might in fact find this book better than the last few they've read in the series.<br /><br />For some of the books in this series, it matters whether you've read the previous books; for this one, it doesn't. You can read this one even if you've not read any of the others, and then if you like this, you might want to try others in the series. If you particularly like the Civil War aspects of it, you might also wish to follow up with Sharyn McCrumb's \\"Ghost Riders\\" (ISBN: 0451211847).<br /><br />In sum: worth reading, a good story, but don't expect as much about Cambridge and Harvard as is usual in this series.	2005-07-23

As a devoted amateur, vertebrate evolution is one of my hobbies, especially that of mammals. I am frequently the person my acquaintances come to, to ask questions about animals. Yet there were things in this book I had never heard of. Certainly the imaginary beast was one I hadn't heard of :D At first, my suspicion was that the one that the author claims would perhaps be named after him, would be imaginary. However, a little research on the web revealed that this animal exists, has since been named, and no, it isn't named after Tim Flannery. (A little web research easily revealed the true culprit, as well.)<br /><br />The authors' sense of humor is not limited to the imaginary animal. There are other humorous notes, such as the Cape rain frog, which is included \\"because it is one of the silliest-looking creatures there is.\\"<br /><br />Another reviewer has already described the sections quite well, so I will not repeat that, but will just mention a few of the particular things that struck me about the contents.<br /><br />A great many of the animals in the book are birds. I admit I don't know nearly as much about birds as I do about mammals, so I perhaps was more easily astonished than a regular birder might be. I also overdosed on birds a bit faster than someone who is fascinated by them might - I wanted to get on to the mammals. I found the inclusion of several different pheasants a bit repetitious, and likewise several different birds of paradise, but they are truly beautiful birds, and wanting more mammals is only my personal preference.<br /><br />The illustrations are beautiful. I might have liked a few actual photographs, but many of these animals would have been difficult to photograph. I might also quibble with a few selections -  pretty much everyone is familiar with the platypus, and many zoos now have colonies of naked mole rats. So, while interesting, these critters are no longer astonishing. On the other hand, some of the animals were truly astonishing: the curlew-jawed mormyrid, which looks an awful lot like an echidna for something that's a fish! And I really would not have believed in the existence of the dense-beaked whale if I hadn't gone to other resources and seen actual photographs of it. The stoplight loosejaw could give a person nightmares.<br /><br />One of the really neat features is the exactly life-size pictures of the pygmy chameleon, the bee hummingbird, and the smallest bat in the world, along with the more-than-a-meter-long slender snipe-eel.<br /><br />This book is often described as a \\"coffee table book\\" but it would make an excellent gift for any young person interested in animals and in need of a challenge to learn more about them, and whoever owns the book, child or adult, will leaf through it far more often than most coffee table books ever get opened.onishing: the curlew-jawed mormyrid, which looks an awful lot like an echidna for something that's a fish!

Beam Piper. I gave the first book 4 stars, in large part because even though there were flaws in the writing, it did appeal to my love of Piper's Paratime series and specifically the story \\"Gunpowder God.\\" This book, however, has no such tribute. This is Turtledove going back to the same old Germans-won-the-war that he has been writing about interminably. This time it's slightly different - supposedly it's WW 1 the Germans won - but the world he comes up with is much the same.<br /><br />Some specific gripes:<br />1. This book is very clearly a juvenile/Young Adult, and yet it's not being marketed as such. It's being sold in bookstores in the science fiction section, and in libraries on the regular adult fiction shelves, rather than the YA or J sections. This makes it an especial disappointment to adult readers, who expect not only better writing out of Turtledove, but also more mature characters in whatever they are reading.<br />2. The adult characters are so simplistically stupid and greedy for profit that it is not possibly to regard them as real people. I know that teenagers think that most adults are somewhat slow and stupid - I was one, once - but I didn't want the adults *agreeing* with me on that; I wanted reassurance that there really were a few smart people out there thinking things through and trying to run things properly. In this book, though, the adults are written as being as slow and stupid as teenagers think they are. Paul's father ignores totally obvious problems; characters state aloud that they are more concerned with profit than anything else; the Crosstime people blithely ignore interference with the culture of the timeline they're in and treat the locals like cartoon characters. Even the adults who do fix things and solve problems, such as Sammy Wong, introduced late in the book as a sort of deus ex machina to get Paul and his father out of trouble, do so with a sneer at everyone else who makes mistakes and complete contempt for the locals.<br />3. Some things are so obvious that they really, really shouldn't be done. Gosh, the Germans, the Triads, everyone is out to find and imprison Paul and he knows it. Wong has hidden him in a hotel with luxury service. So of COURSE Paul sneaks out of the hotel for a hamburger, without discussing it first, telling anyone where he's going, leaving a note, or even, for Pete's sake, dropping bread crumbs. Oh, come ON. And then, after leaving the luxury hotel, which Paul has called a luxury prison, he gets caught and thrown in a real prison, the real prison gets glossed over as if there were no real differences between it and the hotel except for the occasional interrogation. Paul spends less time thinking about how miserable he is in prison than he ever did in the hotel.<br /><br />There are gaping holes in logic, and a gaping lack of rules for Crosstime. I mean, by now, everyone who reads SF at all has a notion of the principle of cultural non-interference. Ignoring that background notion without any explanation of why this culture wouldn't have such rules, is just careless. In fact, careless or thoughtless is what I'd say Turtledove was here. The book was slapped together with no thought to character development at all, no attention to the *good* cliches of alternate timeline stories, and most of the effort going into the bad cliches of young adult fiction.<br /><br />I save my 2-stars for things that have serious editing and continuity flaws, and 1 star for things that are downright unreadable, and this is neither. The story is readable, it's just not very good, and that's why it gets a mediocre rating. There are even a few things I liked about it. The clues that the home timeline is not, in fact, our timeline, are reasonably subtly done. There are some culturally stereotyped characters, but at least the stereotypes are thrown around fairly evenly; there's not any one group of people who has all the intelligence and culture, or any one culture which is particularly worse than all the others. The length of the book is OK. Mostly, the copy editing was well done; there are only a few noticeable typos and grammar errors, quite good by today's rather lowered standards.<br /><br />It's not awful.

US	53030634	RUXF72IXKH0Q1	006057299X	128355253	Every Which Way But Dead (The Hollows, Book 3)	Books	4	100	120	N	N	a slow start, but the plot gets better halfway through	In the first 275 pages of this third volume of the series, there's some action, but nothing actually happens. Rachel resists getting dragged into the ever-after by Algaliarept yet again; Rachel resists getting laid by Kisten yet again; Ivy manages not to bite Rachel yet again... same old, same old. However, about page 275, Rachel decides to let herself be seduced into sex, but not blood, by Kisten. (And if you are a prude about sex between vampires and witches, you shouldn't be reading this book, really.) After we get that out of the way, Rachel can start kicking ass, rounding up bad guys, trading smart-ass remarks with Trent Kalamack, and all the other fun stuff. Up until that point, I thought I was going to have to say that the third volume in the series isn't as good as the second, but based on the last 200 pages, it's the best yet.<br /><br />We get to know more about Weres in this volume. In \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Undead\\" we got elves. This book, we find out lots more about the elves, and more about weres. In fact, at the end of the book, Rachel has a relationship with both Kisten and David (the Were insurance adjustor) but it is so VERY different from Anita Blake's relationships with her vampire and were! Those of you who follow the Anita Blake series will see what I mean - this is not a case of lust for every species she meets an alpha male of, unlike Anita. I really like the character David Hue - and there is apparently a whole subculture of werewolf insurance adjustors, which strikes me as a very funny idea. Closer to Tanya Huff than to Laurell Hamilton.<br /><br />One small complaint I have about this series is that although it's set in Cincinnatti, we don't get much of a sense of the place. I happen to like to know more about the cities our characters live in; that's a personal thing. Some authors do it, some don't. Hamilton's St. Louis is sorta vague - could be any city that has nightclubs, and we only know it's St. Louis because she says it is. Jim Butler's Chicago, where Harry Dresden the wizard and his vampire friends and enemies live, and Tanya Huff's Toronto and Vancouver, on the other hand, are very clearly real places - we learn street names, characteristics of the city, peculiar idioms of the speech of the inhabitants, and so on. Harrison's Cincinnatti falls in between - we know this is a city with a river, and we hear a lot about baseball back in Volume 2, so we can narrow down where it is, but we still don't get much detail.<br /><br />Among other things in this book, we get a 1000-year old elf, who then gets taken in for safekeeping by Mr Keasley across the street, who turns out to be a witch who doesn't want to let people know that's what he is. I suspect that in a later volume, we'll find out more about Mr. Keasley. We meet Trent's fiancee, Ellasbeth, as unpleasant an elf as you'd ever care to avoid. Most important, we meet the villain of the book, Lee Saladan, who shares a secret with Rachel...<br /><br />A short observation that many of the vampire authors seem to have last names beginning with H - if you know of Hamilton and Harrison, but haven't read any Huff or Charlaine Harris yet, you'll want to check them out, too. On the other hand, there's Jim Butler, so it's not a 100% rule.<br /><br />And, for those just finding out about this series, a few notes on how it compares to the overall vampire genre, a/k/a BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification: What is the vampires' position in the world; do they stand as an allegory for women's sexual fears; what powers do the vampires have; are there other supernatural characters; is the author dead serious, if you'll pardon the pun, or have a sense of humor? The answers, in this case: The vampires in this series can be either good or bad guys. Most of them have jobs; they don't exist merely to be evil and brooding, unlike some series which shall remain unnamed. They do have extra powers, which vary based on the age of the vampire and the living or undead status; in general these powers include the usual super strength, and once undead, they live very long lives, but there's no turning into bats, no invisibility or seeping like smoke between walls. These vampires' taking of blood frequently involves sex, but doesn't have to; they do need human blood to survive, unlike some (P.N. Elrod's vampires can survive quite well on animal blood, for example.) There are several other species of supernaturals besides vampires, the most notable of which is that the witches such as Rachel are a separate species, not actually human. Perhaps the least common additional species we have, not one we run across in other series, is the pixies, such as Jenks.<br /><br />In sum: if you liked the second volume of the series, you'll enjoy this even more; if you haven't read the second volume yet, I'd recommend buying it as well and reading them in order, and if you read several vampire series, you should have at least as much fun as I have comparing the similarities and contrasting the differences in how the various authors treat their supernatural characters.ing or undead status; in general these powers include the usual super strength, and once undead, they live very long lives, but there's no turning into bats, no invisibility or seeping like smoke between walls.

US	53030634	R2OSWW2ER2J8IR	0756402859	758629294	Gateways	Books	3	8	13	N	N	mostly bland, predictable, and Young Adult	There are OK stories in here, some by excellent authors. There are a couple of stories that I didn't finish bothering to read. And there are *many* stories that are Young Adult/teenager \\"coming of age\\" stories, at a level of predictability that gets boring after a while. I wouldn't call this book a waste of money - it was more readable than not - but it was a disappointment compared to what the theme could have led to.<br /><br />A few highlights and \\"lowlights\\" for consideration:<br /><br />\\"The Two Sheckleys\\" - Robert Sheckley got asked to write a story for this anthology, and wrote a parody of himself writing a story, tossing in every clich&eacute; he could. There are funny moments, but it's not nearly as funny as he thinks it is, and sometimes a clear note of contempt for the whole concept leaks through.<br /><br />\\"Postcards\\" by Rebecca Moesta - one of the completely predictable teenage themed and teenage aimed stories.<br /><br />\\"The Trigger\\" - another predictable coming-of-age story, where the note of science fiction - a sudden disappearance to another, unexplained world - is completely incidental; the same story could have been written without any SF at all, and made the same point. Rich parents try to provide daughter with everything that money can buy; daughter rebels. It's not badly done, but it's not really science fiction/fantasy, either, since the story would be exactly the same without the other world.<br /><br />\\"Spring Break\\" - another Young Adult story, but this one is silly enough to actually be funny. I enjoyed it. Lightweight, no point, teenage protagonists - but very funny.<br /><br />\\"By The Rules\\" - another Young Adult story, with college protagonists engaged in RPGs, but a slightly different plot from standard, this was enjoyable, if predictable (again) - and I suppose a lot of adults who are still RP-ers would enjoy the comeuppance given to someone who always takes the same, completely predictable, role, and who always insists on running the game.<br /><br />\\"Circle of Compassion\\" - this one I really liked. A war story, no teenagers, an unusual solution to a challenge, and an ending that hints that this may become part of a larger novel or a series set in the universe it occurs in. Asian historical setting instead of teenage America a nice change of pace.<br /><br />\\"The Doorway in Stephensons Store\\" (the lack of apostrophe is deliberate) - a nice story, jump-back-in-your-own-timeline theme, nice ending.<br /><br />Okay, that's a sampling. There are 19 stories in all; you might find that you liked more of them than I did, and possibly you are younger than I am and so the many coming-of-age stories are of more interest. As an alleged grown-up, I'd say: buy this one, read through it quickly, and plan to give it to a science-fiction reading teenager of your acquaintance thereafter, rather than keeping it for your permanent collection.assion\\" - this one I really liked.

US	53030634	R1ZEGKUMFLHZ53	0441110444	459053261	Clarke County, Space	Books	5	7	8	N	N	A very funny tribute to Heinlein and Clarke	Clarke County - well, sounds like an all-American name, doesn't it? As it happens, the colonists have apparently named it after Arthur C. - if you're skimming through the book, you'd miss the brief mention of his statue. That said, yes, the rest of the plot does have more to do with Heinlein's books than Clarke's. It's a rousing story, plenty of action, several connected threads. I *would* recommend reading \\"The Moon is a Harsh Mistress\\" by Heinlein before you read this, especially to refresh your memory of Mycroft.<br /><br />The Church of Elvis provides a lot of the fun - but so does Blind Boy Grunt. Even the more serious characters have their moments of fun. Police chief Bigthorn, of Native American ancestry, has a sense of humor, even when he's being almost blown up. We also have some villains we can enjoy - heartless lawyers representing soulless corporations, that sort of thing, that we can unabashedly revile. A hired killer code-named the Golem, complete with an explanation of the original Golem and some scary insight into the assassin's psychology.<br /><br />The only disappointment in the book is the very end - involving Simon McCoy. I thought this particular bit of explanation to be rather out-of-nowhere and arbitrary. Works as a plot device, but not as a plot or a character, in my opinion. However, it's quite possible to just ignore that part.<br /><br />If what you know of Allen Steele is his more recent Coyote series, you will find this book to be both similar and different. There's some of the same questions of exactly what constitutes patriotism, and when is it correct to decide that one's patriotism should be devoted to creating a new country. There are also the same Heinleinian issues of figuring out what it takes to be self-sufficient, and how big a political/geographical entity do you need to have to be self-sufficient. (Steele poses these questions in the spirit of Heinlein, but the answers to these questions are not the same as Heinlein's.) There is more humor in this book than in the Coyote series, rather less time spent on assorted military preparations.<br /><br />All in all, while not a complete masterpiece - it's a little too lightweight for that - it is a worthwhile, fun, read, and gets five stars for being accessible, funny, not as politically strident as some books in the same vein, and having lots of in-jokes for science fiction fans.)

US	53030634	R21H8580PJV6QJ	088038767X	554973107	Too, Too Solid Flesh	Books	5	3	4	N	N	Shakespeare meets Caves of Steel	This book doesn't resemble Asimov's classic Caves of Steel much, but there is definitely homage paid to that classic throughout, and if you've never read Caves of Steel, you will be the poorer for it. In both books, we have a human and an android trying to solve a murder mystery. In Caves of Steel, it was sometimes necessary for R. Daneel to pass as human in order to do his job (even though that's illegal); in Too Too Solid Flesh, we have a human trying to pass as an android. Horatio can't find work as a human actor - there are no jobs for human actors any more, in this future. So he's masquerading as an android - even during sex.<br /><br />At the same time, if you don't have a passing familiarity with Shakespeare, and with \\"Hamlet\\" in particular, you are going to miss a lot in this book. I try not to be too snobby about my opinion that the world would be a better place if more people read and re-read Shakespeare just for fun, but, well, the world WOULD be a better place. And you'd get more of the sly references/in-jokes in this book. You would notice when the characters accidentally fall into iambic pentameter while conversing, for instance. (from a source I've forgotten: \\"Oh who is writing poetry sublime? I am, I am, I am, I am, I am.\\")<br /><br />The interplay between the characters' roles in the play and their roles in the \\"real life\\" of the book is fascinating. All sorts of questions arise over whether humans' actions are any more the product of free will than androids' - or are we as much shaped by the roles other people have envisioned as our destiny before we were old enough to make choices?<br /><br />And there's the question of whether being human and having the free will to make choices - often bad ones - is necessarily better than being an android. When the real reason the theatre project exists is finally revealed, one would have to doubt that humans have the wisdom to make good choices. This part of the plot hinges on technology (I won't give away what) outstripping our ability to deal with it rationally - just as the entire book up to that point hinges on our ability to build androids outstripping our ideas of what they are for and how they should be used.<br /><br />I first discovered O'Donohoe through his Crossroads fantasy series, about veterinary students who get to practice on unicorns and griffins. This book is quite different, but still displays O'Donohoe's talents at humor and intricate dialogue. I don't know whether they were meant to appeal to entirely different audiences, but I find myself quite glad that my interests are broad enough that I thought to read both.ay what) outstripping our ability to deal with it rationally - just as the entire book up to that point hinges on our ability to build androids outstripping our ideas of what they are for and how they should be used. <br /> <br />I first discovered O'Donohoe through his Crossroads fantasy series, about veterinary students who get to practice on unicorns and griffins.

Most of that alternate history is background; the books are set far enough in the future that the intrigue and battles in space stand on their own, even if the reader is a little fuzzy on the idea of alternate histories.<br /><br />It does help to read the first book, Wasteland of Flint, first, to get some sense of the characters; however, this book can be read without that - while one might miss a few references to things that happened before, there are enough new characters, and the personalities of the continuing characters are strong enough, that their words and actions stand on their own, even without the background.<br /><br />The plot is full of intrigue and double crosses and double-double crosses - it takes some following, perhaps even a few notes scribbled on your bookmark, to remember who works for whom, and who is secretly what other than what they seem. It makes this a juicy read, but not a light one - you can't skim, you'd better read every word, or you will lose the thread of some subplot.<br /><br />As with the previous book, this one is pretty much GP-rated: although there's violence, it is not all blood and gore, and there's almost nothing of a sexual nature. Not that the characters aren't sexual beings, just that it's not an important part of the plot, and no time is spent dwelling on their sex lives.<br /><br />The major plot twist here is the introduction of a hidden alien, apparently a shape-shifter, and that alien features in the cliff-hanger ending. There will clearly be another volume, and it seems likely that some of our military characters that were introduced in this book will carry over, as well as all those that carried from the first book. Gretchen has acquired as a friend, sort of, a native of the planet she's been on; it remains to be seen whether this character will travel with her to other places. The race this alien is from was once space-faring, now devolved and planet-bound, and it would be interesting to see how members of the species might return to space.<br /><br />I found the foiling of some of the underhanded tricks to be very satisfying, and the fact that it wasn't completely obvious up front, nor was it unrealistically without loss or damage, to add the the pleasure in following the plot. Perhaps the most disappointing thing, on the other hand, was the alien artifact that Gretchen is initially sent to look for. It is not well developed as a plot device, if you'll pardon the pun, and is destroyed in a rather simplistic \\"there are some things man was not meant to know!\\" way. So the book isn't perfect. It is, however, the best one by Harlan so far, and a great read for fans both of military SF and alternate history SF.r this character will travel with her to other places.

You know, now I can't remember what prompted me to purchase this book, but I'm glad I did. It isn't perfect, but it was quite enjoyable. I doubt, however, that someone who doesn't like or doesn't know anything about baseball, would enjoy it much. I grew up in New York, and then lived in Boston for 10 years, and lived for a time two blocks from Fenway Park; we'd go up to the roof with a cooler and lawn chairs, and be able to see a lot of the game. So, while I'm not a baseball fanatic, yes, I like baseball. As I read this, I kept thinking that my late mother, who was far more of a baseball fan, would have enjoyed it even more.<br /><br />I have picky tastes about fantasy, too, juvenile or adult. A story has to have some subtlety to it, and some rules. And I like a touch of humor. This novel has all three, to a degree adequate for an adult novel, not just a Young Adult. It's also got vocabulary that will certainly send Young Adults, and possibly some older ones, to their dictionaries. One reviewer compared the book to Narnia with a list of similarities; I would say that the differences are that this book has a sense of humor, and it's subtle enough not to hit you over the head with a sledgehammer about its point. Frankly, I never found the Narnia books worth rereading; I've found them simplistic, and the Christian allegory a little too over-riding for my tastes, though I enjoyed them when I was 10. Summerland is not a Christian allegory at all; it combines some aspects of many religions, and some of no religion at all. So those hoping to find \\"another Narnia\\" because they want a good \\"Christian story\\" will be disappointed. The rest of us, however, appreciate the work that went into picking ideas out of many traditions - Norse, Native American, Celtic, and secular legends.<br /><br />In particular, the Tall Men seem to represent legendary large figures from every area - there's a recognizable John Bunyan equivalent, but others are clearly from non-Anglo-Western traditions.<br /><br />Some of my favorite things about the book:<br /><br />*The Saab named Skidbladnir, Skid for short, and all its dials in Swedish. Hey, now I know the Swedish for gasoline and volume!<br /><br />*Grim the Giant, who is not quite 5 feet tall.<br /><br />*The size changes required for Fair Folk to play baseball with Tall Men or even humans, and the comments on how the perception of size affects one's play.<br /><br />*The wererat; the only other wererat I've read in fantasy is in Laurell Hamilton's Anita Blake series, and it's interesting to compare the ideas of what a human-rat were would turn out like. (Note: the Hamilton series is emphatically NOT young adult!!)<br /><br />Stuff I didn't like: the ending, unlike the rest of the book, was a little too simple. I think I would have liked the victory to be a teensy bit less obvious, and our heroes' trip back home to be more difficult, as, for example, in The Hobbit and Lord of The Rings, where going home again takes some effort, and the characters' experiences have changed them enough that home is no longer as comfortable as it once was. In Summerland, the characters have grown up some, but they slide right back into the limited society of Clam Island as if nobody else noticed anything different.<br /><br />All in all, worth the read, and then pass it along to someone else who loves both books and baseball!itions.  <br /> <br />Some of my favorite things about the book: <br />*The Saab named Skidbladnir, Skid for short, and all its dials in Swedish.

US	53030634	R3B5XJYX51CFR7	1932100296	229683639	In the Face of Death: An Historical Horror Novel (Count Saint-Germain series)	Books	3	4	6	N	Y	Not her best work, but readable	This is a perfectly readable novel, if you weren't expecting anything extraordinary. If you've been following the entire St. Germain series, you'll want this for the sake of completeness. And if you are already a fan of historical vampire romance, then this is a pleasant book of that kind. Particularly if you are a fan of the American Civil War, the historical aspects of this will interest you. But if you are looking for *very* vampire, this isn't it. It isn't as clever or as detailed as the St. Germain books.<br /><br />This one features Madelaine de Montalia, whom we first met in Hotel Transylvania, and who has appeared in a few of the other St. Germain books.<br /><br />Let's look at it from the several different genres it might fit into. It's weakest as a vampire novel, only middling as a romance, interesting as a historical. From the vampire aspect, it follows the St. Germain pattern, of course: vampires are long-lived, can be killed by severing the spinal cord or by fire, are stronger than normal but don't have \\"supernatural\\" powers as such - no fading into smoke, turning invisible, etc. For the most part, vampires are (a) rare, and (b) good guys, in Yarbro's universe. They don't necessarily drink blood itself; they absorb a life essence from shared sexual passion, although they *can* drink blood when necessary. So Yarbro's books in general, and this one in particular, do not fall into the evil, brooding blood-sucker vampire pattern. In this book in particular, one might almost not even notice that Madelaine is a vampire - the only aspect of her vampirism that's important to the story is her age. Even when she and Sherman are making love, it's not really important that she's a vampire.<br /><br />From the romance side of things, certainly an affair with William T. Sherman is a fairly novel idea. Sherman is not, however, as well drawn as we might like - we don't get nearly enough of an idea of him as a person. What we do get a lot of, more than I personally needed, is his agonizing \\"I can't leave my wife, but I can't resist you; woe is me!\\" stuff - over, and over, year in and year out. Conflicted is a character trait that can be interesting, but it isn't, particularly, here. Your tastes may vary, however.<br /><br />As a historical, that's where we get some of Yarbro's best efforts in this book. Not as good as her best, but that may just be because I am less interested in recent history than in ancient history; in the novels that take place before the industrial revolution, more of the cultural aspects are strange to me, and there's more new detail to find interesting. In the 19th century USA, there's not as much new to learn. But again, your opinion may vary, particularly if you like the era. Apart from our glimpses of Sherman's maneuvering, the most important things happening here are the lives of the Native Americans, and nursing/medical practice during the war, including a lot of herbal medicine. I don't know enough about Native American history to judge the accuracy of some of these things; we don't get too much of a look in depth at any one particular culture. Madelaine bounces from tribe to tribe, and I personally would have liked to see more detail about some of them. Oh, and we do get an awful lot of details about Madelaine's clothing, which I wasn't very interested in - but some people are fans of historical costume, and certainly the romance readers should enjoy the descriptions of the gowns.<br /><br />Most readers will know already how the war ends, no surprises there. That, it seems to me, is also a result of it being from a period that most of us already know something about. Novels set in 10th century Poland or other exotic locales can hold many more surprises for us; we don't know ahead of time how they end.<br /><br />Overall? Lighter weight than we've come to expect from the St. Germain series, but an OK read if you set your expectations down at \\"ordinary 300-page historical romance.\\"ly needed, is his agonizing \\"I can't leave my wife, but I can't resist you; woe is me!\\" stuff - over, and over, year in and year out.

McGarrity is one of those authors whom I'll buy in hardcover, rather than waiting for the paperback.<br /><br />As other reviews have mentioned the plot summary already, I'll bypass most of that, and instead mention some of the specific details I found particularly interesting in this book of the series.<br /><br />First, we don't see any of Kearney's older son, also a policeman, whom we have met in several previous books. In this one, Kearney's younger son - the 10-month old one living near the Pentagon, along with Kearney's career army wife, Sara - gets a bit of the spotlight. The unusual marriage between Kevin and Sara gets strained some, but also becomes solider as a result of the strains - Kevin resists some flirtation by some of the women he meets in the course of the book.<br /><br />Several seemingly unrelated plot threads come together, as parts of Kearney's investigation turn out to be things that Sara is professionally interested in. She is doing an interesting report on some sexual harassment cases that the army is trying to sweep under the rug. Sara's anger at the attempt to ignore the problem is balanced by her later glee at the opportunity to call attention to it from another direction entirely.<br /><br />The main plot thread revolves around a young man who supposedly died in a helicopter crash in Vietnam 30 years before. Or did he? Right now, anything that recalls Vietnam has some resonance for many of us, and the characters involved in this part of the plot include everything from hippies on communes to rich men who buy their kids' way out of the war. The book doesn't take a current political stance - thank goodness - but it does give a reader a chance to think about issues that are still important today.<br /><br />You can tell, pretty much as soon as we meet the crazy old lady, that she is not, in fact, crazy - it's not a spoiler to tell you that much. The dead man's current wife, on the other hand, is a little more psychopathic than she seems at first.<br /><br />And when we meet the people to whom the pharmacist has been selling drugs, it's a nice contrast between the old hippies, supposedly all stoned, and the rich people who are currently stoned. I like the irony here.<br /><br />That should be enough teasers to make you want to read the book fairly soon. Let me say, though, that if you haven't read ANY of the previous books in the series, you will be best off if you find copies and read them, before starting this book. A full appreciation of what's going on in the plot depends, in part, on knowing our characters' backgrounds.t, crazy - it's not a spoiler to tell you that much.

As others have mentioned, this may be Book 2 of the Viscount trilogy, but it's actually book 4 of a series, and you DO need to read the previous 3 in order to appreciate this one.<br /><br />I have noticed, as time goes by, that there is a pattern to opinions about the Khaavren series: those who started reading Steven Brust's Vlad Taltos series first, and bought one of the Khaavren books because it was by Brust, don't seem to appreciate the Khaavren books as much. Those of us, on the other hand, who started on Brust with this series, or with some of Brust's other fantasies entirely, seem to enjoy the Khaavren books more. I believe it's a question both of writing style, and of one's definition of action. Thus, if you really, really like the Vlad Taltos books, and you expect these to be similar, it may be that you will be less than enchanted with these.<br /><br />I believe that those who have read a lot of older literature - Dumas, as many have mentioned, and definitely Shakespeare - will enjoy this book, and the Khaavren series, more than the Vlad Taltos fans will, on average. (Of course, every reader has a unique background and a unique perspective - don't let me stop you from reading!!) Certainly a background of the Three Musketeers (and not the movie, people!) helps one appreciate what's going on here - but a knowledge of, say, the battles in Shakespeare's Richard and Henry plays, does not come at all amiss. And a comfort level with the intricate language of Shakespeare, as well as the overwrought prose of Dumas, gives one the stamina to follow Paarfi's extensive perorations.<br /><br />Let me also mention that there's a dash of Romeo and Juliet in here, with lovers from different houses and their disapproving families. Those who feel that there is not enough action in this book, apparently do not consider a good heartbreaking love story to be action. But it is! So is the evolution of the magic taking place - if moving hundreds of warriors via magic/mental powers, over hundreds of miles, which has never been done before in this world, is not action, then what is? There are no slow moments if one is interested in emotion and magic as well as in swords and battle; there is always something happening between people.<br /><br />As with previous books in the series, if you do like it, it has an effect on you: you talk funny for days afterward, if not weeks! Hey, if you are planning on taking the GREs or GMATs, this series is a terrific vocabulary builder!! There will be nothing in the verbal section that you can't handle, if you enjoy and appreciate Paarfi!<br /><br />In short - if you already like this series, this volume is a must; if you like Dumas and Shakespeare, you'll like this; if you like Vlad Taltos, then start in on this series in cautious, easy steps.s, which has never been done before in this world, is not action, then what is?

US	53030634	R1IXSAB97Z3ZW1	0812534174	343590457	The Paths of the Dead (The Viscount of Adrilankha, Book 1)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	This book will make you talk funny for weeks afterward	First off, I would strongly advise reading the two earlier books - even though this is advertised as Book 1 of \\"The Viscount of Adrilankha,\\" it is not, in fact, the first book in the series. You should read \\"The Phoenix Guards\\" and \\"Five Hundred Years After\\" first. I'll wait while you click to buy those... OK, you're back. (I should mention that there are fan websites for this series, which I have not viewed; it is possible that there are people who give you far more in the way of hints and spoilers than this reviewer will. I myself prefer to avoid spoilers so that I can have the joy of looking for all the inside jokes and solving all the puzzles without help, and only looking for other people's interpretations after I have gone as far as possible on my own.)<br /><br />Now a little bit about the series. The first book made me talk funny for several days, and my spousal unit is STILL talking funny on occasion, even though it's been a year since we discovered \\"The Phoenix Guards.\\" \\"Five Hundred Years Later\\" was not quite as funny - but it contains a great deal of plot you won't want to miss. This book gets back to being hysterically funny, and it leaves the reader thinking in long paragraphs which contain sentences which have several nested clauses within them. So, sort of like some other famous series, the first and third book (where this is the third) are better than the 2nd; you read the 2nd as a bridge between the two.<br /><br />Now, this book in particular. In this book, Brust acknowledges the deep debt he has to Tolkein. What, you say? You pretend that there is some connection between Tolkein's fantasy and Brust's, beyond that of the general category of fantasy? Well, yes, I do myself the honor of making that claim. There has been a great deal of imitation of Tolkein over the past 40 years, featuring elves and whatnot that have funny names and go on quests for magical objects, and most of it, in my opinion, stinks. Brust's books, however, take the same basic elements but make something creatively new while acknowledging \\"the mother of all modern fantasy.\\" For example, in this book, we finally learn what the Easterners - you know, those short-lived people like us - call the Dragaerans: elfs. We find this out through a very funny scene in which Morrolan discovers that he is an elf, and wanders through several pages doing the Dragaeran equivalent of smacking his head: I'm an *elf*?!? *I'm* an elf?!? And we, of course, also smack our heads, because while we knew that Dragaerans were different, we didn't think of applying this term to them, but now that we hear it, we go, of course! Long-lived, tall and slender, trying to be kind to short and short-lived people, even though they don't mix much? Of course they're elves!<br /><br />Next, we have a blatant tribute to LOTR, in which our mixed party of elfs and humans enters an enchanted mountain by way of an invisible door into that mountain...<br /><br />By the way, it is absolutely necessary that you read all of the acknowledgments, introductions, and so on, especially the essay at the end, \\"Some Notes Toward Two Analyses of Auctorial Method and Voice.\\" This is known, for short, as \\"How to write like Paarfi.\\" Here, there is more fun. One of my favorite lines is the one about the play \\"Redwreath and Goldstar Have Travelled to Deathsgate.\\" It is possible, if you are not of my generation, that you don't know what this refers to, and I will only give you one hint: translate the names Redwreath and Goldstar into German. (Or Dutch, and I suspect Danish and Swedish are similar.)<br /><br />There are also, throughout the book, many subtle references to some of the great classics of fantasy, and if you are a younger reader who has not read them all, I would suggest picking up some copies of, amongst others, Fritz Leiber's works. (A sentence from the short story, \\"The Holy Grail\\":<br /><br />  \\"The great magician (there was something hysterical about the way Mouse insisted on that \\"great,\\" for to the world Glavas Rho was but a hedge-wizard, no better than a Mingol necromancer with his second-sighted spotted dog or a conjurer beggar of Quarmall) - the great magician and his dwelling were alike protected by strong enchantments no impious outsider cound breach - not even (the heart of Mouse skipped a beat) the lord paramount of these forests, Duke Janarrl, who hated all magic, but white worse than black.\\"<br /><br />And that's by no means the longest sentence in there! Furthermore, the city in Leiber's stories is named Lankhmar, clearly an antecedent of Adrilankha.) While much of Leiber's work may seem old-fashioned - much of it was written about 40 years ago) - it contains the seeds of much of the same kind of humor and sword-and-sorcery that Brust uses.<br /><br />In short: if you hate wordplay and adventure, you'll hate this book; everyone else, however, should enjoy it hugely!!that \\"great,\\" for to the world Glavas Rho was but a hedge-wizard, no better than a Mingol necromancer with his second-sighted spotted dog or a conjurer beggar of Quarmall) - the great magician and his dwelling were alike protected by strong enchantments no impious outsider cound breach - not even (the heart of Mouse skipped a beat) the lord paramount of these forests, Duke Janarrl, who hated all magic, but white worse than black.\\"       <br />And that's by no means the longest sentence in there!

US	53030634	R2LJVG3HOTHTRY	156477399X	91225513	Crocheted Sweaters	Books	5	39	41	N	Y	Terrific for beginners, and lots of warm-weather sweaters!	This book could be used by a beginner who has only done straight scarves, to do their first sweater. Pages 95 to 117 are a pretty comprehensive \\"how to crochet, how to choose a pattern, how to choose a yarn\\" set of instructions. There are sweaters in here using only the simplest of stitches, and very thorough instructions for sweaters that use more complex stitches.<br /><br />While several people have mentioned that they found some of the yarns obscure, I have had no problems finding these yarns in specialty shops and especially on eBay; you may not find them at big chain crafts stores (we don't need to mention names) but then, if you are going to make sweaters you'll want to wear for a lifetime, you don't want to use mass market acrylic yarn, so the hunt for specialty yarns is worth it. The section of the book on how to choose a yarn will help you find equivalents if you don't find the exact brand. There are many interchangeable medium-weight cotton and rayon yarns. And for those whose only place to buy yarn is a chain store, check out, say, the \\"Bright Ideas\\" pattern, made with Lion Brand Microspun microfiber yarn. For many of the obscure DK/sport weight yarns, you could substitute Berroco Cotton Twist with no problem! If all else fails, bring the book with you when you shop for yarn, and use the guide on pages 124-125: hold a sample of a yarn you've found against the picture of the yarn called for, to see if it's the same width and fuzziness. The only other trick to substituting yarns is the stretchiness factor; if a pattern calls for a very stretchy yarn, you can't substitute cotton or rayon. But most of these patterns call for chenille, fake-fur and eyelash, and cotton or rayon blends to begin with. (Can you tell I really like this feature of the book? I'm a cotton nut!!)<br /><br />Many of the sweaters are made with cotton or rayon yarns and have short-sleeved versions, so that they are suitable even for people who live in warm-weather climates. If you're in Florida or Texas or a similar climate, you'll appreciate this! As I write this, it's 99 degrees in the middle of September, and I haven't made a long-sleeved sweater or used wool yarn in YEARS! I am continually disappointed by new books of sweater patterns that seem to assume everyone lives above the 38th parallel; this book is one of the few that has just as many sweaters for those of us down around the 31st parallel. Even many of the long-sleeved sweaters are made with cotton blends rather than wool blends.<br /><br />One especially valuable feature of this book is the \\"Foundations\\" sections at the end of several patterns - these are mini-lessons, tips and tricks. There are a few that taught me something new, even though I have been crocheting for ::mumble:: (forty years) ::mumble:: Beginners could flip through and read all the Foundations bits before starting on something.e in Florida or Texas or a similar climate, you'll appreciate this!

There are all the details you would expect, and all the background.<br /><br />Barbara Holloway, a lawyer who wishes neither to act like one nor make money like one, holds office hours in a cafe. A lot of people who would never be seen walking into a law office will come sit at her cafe table. So she gets the odd cases. Odd, but even though they aren't things that happen in everyday life, Wilhelm makes them believable.<br /><br />It's best to read the series in order - I'll wait while you order the other books :-)  - because there are background details about our protagonist's life that you need to know. Who is this guy Darren and his kid Todd, anyway?? What's going on between Barbara and her father Frank? You can read this book without that background, but it's more fun if you do know it.<br /><br />This particular book has a complex plot, spanning not only the width of the country but parts of Mexico as well, and spanning several decades of time. A young woman with childhood amnesia accidentally discovers that she is a piano prodigy - shortly before being arrested for murder. Uncovering the real murderer involves digging into everything from illegal border crossings to the Federal Witness Protection Program. The publisher's blurbs and back cover could sum up the plot for you, so I'll skip that. Instead let me mention a couple of details I particularly enjoyed. The piano playing, of course - if you are familiar with classical music and jazz standards, you will find them running through your head as you read about Carrie's piano playing in the lounge. And related to that, the discussion of people who have the talent of seeing or hearing something in their heads, so that they can practice their talent, be it music or otherwise, even without the proper tools. The insight into the minds that have this talent is very interesting; part of the discussion about it compares it to riding a bicycle - the muscle memory that says you never really forget how, once you've learned.<br /><br />Carrie remembers details about her childhood that most people think are fantasies - who, for example, would think that Aunt Loony and Uncle Silly are real, rather than imaginary playmates? The exposition as we uncover the family that has been denied to her is great.<br /><br />I suspect we'll be hearing more from the women's club that brings Barbara this case. Some of the characters introduced in this book will probably become part of the continuing cast. I will be looking forward to the next one!or otherwise, even without the proper tools.

US	53030634	R1JNWDQOMMZIK0	1401201911	616430793	Superman: Red Son	Books	4	38	47	N	N	An alternate history for science fiction readers	This graphic novel is not a parody, it's an alternate history. A most unusual alt-history: an alternate to a fictional reality, rather than an alternate version of our history. (The most popular themes for alternate history are, What if the South won the Civil War?, and What if the Germans won WWII?)<br /><br />Alternate history is a concept generally more familiar to those who read SF novels rather than comics/graphic novels. Many of us SF novel readers did read a lot of comics when we were younger, though, and I think this particular graphic novel is aimed at us. We read Superman - and Batman, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman - in the 50's, 60's and 70's. So, although we may not have read any other of this particular series of graphic novels, we have quite a bit of background in the Superman mythos - his real parents, where he grew up, girlfriends, enemies, etc.<br /><br />I think that knowing that background from the original comics may make this book more enjoyable to my middle-aged generation than to people who are used only to the graphic novels. As well, my generation had the advantage of living through most of the history that was really happening from 1950 on. For those who know the history of the Cold War only from school, many of the details wouldn't make sense. It helps a great deal in reading this book if you are familiar with the course of the Cold War, and that you know not only who JFK was, but some of the celebrity gossip about him as well as the official records. (The name Norma Jean should mean something to you.) You should know what the Warsaw Pact was, and something about in what order the Soviet Union took over various countries.<br /><br />I liked the way the book involved similar alternate twists on Batman, and brought in Wonder Woman and Green Lantern as well. Batman's hat is the funniest thing I've seen in a while!<br /><br />A couple quibbles: having the artwork done by more than one artist is distracting; a couple times it was hard to recognize Lois Lane as herself. And I do wish that illustrators would STOP trying to use the Cyrillic alphabet incorrectly. If you can't use the letters for what they really are, don't use them, please. The thing that looks like a backwards R is NOT an R. The letter that looks like a backwards N is NOT an N. So stop it already! Just go for English in the signs and titles, or for accurate Russian. (One illustrator did this correctly, but on many pages, and the cover art, these letters are used incorrectly.) OK, that's one of my pet peeves, since I happen to be able to read Russian a little; it may not bother other people as much as it bugs me.<br /><br />Summary?

If you liked those, you'll love this	This appears to be the first in a series, and I will *definitely* buy the next one. This was a great read. Not absolutely perfect, but really really good.<br />Details: our heroine is a forensic anthropologist turned museum director. If you recall Aaron Elkins' series about Gideon Oliver, the \\"Bone Detective\\" then you'll recognize the profession. Diane spent ten years working for an international rights group, identifying mass graves from dictatorships so that the dictators and their henchmen could be prosecuted. In that time, she saw one mass grave too many, and doesn't ever want to deal with human remains again; that's why she accepts a position as the director of a natural history museum. She expects to spend her days dealing with dinosaur bones and extinct giant ground sloths. But bones have a way of finding her.<br />The details about the museum are great. I suspect that Diane has far more freedom, and things are run more loosely, than they are in real life, but let's face it, all of the exact, real details of the bureaucracy required to run a museum would NOT be exciting reading. A floor plan is given of the museum. I'm a big fan of natural history museums myself; I've been a member of the American Museum of Natural History in New York for decades now. The museum in the book is just outside Atlanta, GA, an area I'm not familiar with, so I don't know what real town our book town of Rosewood most resembles.<br />There are several plots going on at one time here, with all my favorite sorts of villains and supporting characters - scheming real estate dealers, twisted cops, absent-minded professors, eccentric grad students, classical musicians, and more. Diane's cop friend Frank is a detective for computer and financial fraud, and some of the other police refer to him as a \\"paper cop.\\" When a family is mass-murdered except for an adopted daughter, the \\"grandparents\\" show up, and while they are a little bit stereotyped and less realistic than the others, they are quite funny - it's OK to have a bit of comic relief. Those are the only characters I didn't really like the descriptions of, though.<br />Another thing that's nice is how many different people help find clues and solve parts of the mystery, and how much our heroine acknowledges and thanks them. When Frank is in the hospital, we meet his brothers. One of them is a sports physician, and when he sees the skeleton Diane is working on, he is able to provide an important insight that helps identify the victim - Diane, living in Georgia and having worked in South America for years, was unlikely to recognize hockey injuries. Some authors make their detective characters so all-knowing on their own that they are somewhat unbelievable; characters are much more believable when they can use some outside help.<br />There's enough in this book to appeal to the fans of several kinds of mysteries: rivalry between local police, county sheriff's department, and GBI; several unusual professions; classical music; fine arts; taxidermy. There's romance between Diane and Frank, but only a little implied sex, no explicit sex, but there is some \\"bad\\" language (several characters curse, pretty much where people would realistically curse, in my opinion) so if you consider the presence of any four-letter words at all to be a negative, you wouldn't be pleased with that. As I said, at the places they curse, they pretty much are saying what would fall out of my mouth under the circumstances; I didn't have a problem at all with it. But some people are more sensitive to such things than others.<br />I look forward to hearing more about the museum - whether some of the exhibits that Diane plans while she is hiding out in a pond overnight turn out to be popular; future chess games against the nicest of the absent-minded professors, and so on - as well as future clever plots and teamwork.ite funny - it's OK to have a bit of comic relief.

US	53030634	R12Z869GZQALQS	031298460X	529940744	Complete Abandon	Books	2	12	17	N	N	Contradictions: good writing, no plot, cardboard characters.	The plot of this book is: oral sex. That's it. Hope that's not too blunt for you. But that really is about all that's going on. If that's what you want in a \\"romance\\" then this is the book for you, because it is much better written than many such books are. The author can write good descriptions, and has a good writing style, and there are very few of the grammar and word-misusage errors that plague so many mass market paperbacks these days.  But despite her gift for description, the characters are either all-good, all-evil, or unbelievable. Examples: our heroine is intelligent, beautiful, knows how to deliver babies and keep estate books, eats too little so that her adorable little sister and senile aging mother can have enough to eat; her only vices are being willing to steal food to feed the starving, and her rather inexplicable lust. The would-be fiancee is a very nice girl, well-behaved, intelligent, well-trained, well-spoken, pretty, and quite nice - not a single flaw except her inability to understand that the hero will never marry her. The vicar is all-evil, not only stupid and venal and weak, but a sadist and pederast to boot. And the mistress is likewise all-bad: always greedy, always willing to cheat and lie. And both our hero and his brother are rather unbelievable - well described, handsome, and nice people, but no particular reasons given why they should be nice. The hero is transformed from debauched libertine to sober, responsible, property owner, solely by the power of the heroine's love, or at least unstinting lust. The brother is a bastard - literally - who has been stealing from the estate, but it turns out there's a perfectly good justification for it; he flip-flops from loving his brother to hating him, without ever wanting the actual estate which he, being the elder, would inherit if he were legitimate. There isn't enough motivation given for either the hero or the brother's actions.<br />In sum: way better writing and better dialogue than most books that are mainly sex, but way less character and plot than most that are about romance.t books that are mainly sex, but way less character and plot than most that are about romance.	2004-05-17

Father Tibor has changed quite a bit from early in the series, and I'm not sure he's quite consistent in this one, though it makes no difference to the plot. He seems younger, and less philosophical somehow - although he talks about evil, and he is involved with some odd outreach, he spends much less time referring to things in books, and seems to me somehow less deep than usual.<br />Also as the series goes by, Bennis seems to spend less and less time at writing her books, building her models, or anything related to her work.<br />But those are quibbles. The overall plot- a couple of murders, a botched FBI investigation, a discount store chain going into bankruptcy, and the church bombing, all of which only Gregor sees as connected, at first - is intricate. All the usual sorts of suspects are there. High society is skewered; fanatics of all sorts are skewered. The solution is under our noses - as Gregor muses, it's almost always about love or money; if one stops looking at extraneous details and follows the money, one has a good chance of finding the killer.<br />Perhaps the most interesting part of the book is reading excerpts from the (real) web sites of various conspiracy theory groups. You know, the ones convinced that the Illuminati are using mind control to bring about One World Order; the CIA and the Pope are hand in hand to assassinate Kennedys and blow up buildings, and other stuff even less sane. In an introduction, the author points out that every single web site she cites is, unfortunately, real. Her insight into the muddled thinking of specific characters in these conspiracy theory groups is chilling.<br />Perhaps my favorite side plot is the one involving Tony Ross's (the first victim) sister. She runs a &quot;mission&quot; to rescue child prostitutes. The difference is that her mission is an atheist one; our fictional character is a member of the real group Freedom From Religion Foundation, a group your devoted reviewer also happens to belong to. Atheists are portrayed in a favorable light, something all too rare in American culture these days. (Tibor muses that he has been around enough to know that saints come in many flavors, including atheist saints.) It was truly enjoyable for me to read something that doesn't buy wholeheartedly into the notion our current administration has that the only good works are faith-based ones. As a corollary to this, if you happen to be a Christian fundamentalist, please don't bother reading this book - it will only annoy you and raise your blood pressure.<br />With all those details I've barely mentioned the plot, and that's part of the way this book struck me - the details and characters were so interesting that solving the plot was almost a minor consideration. That doesn't mean there wasn't lots of action, or that the plot wasn't good - it was. It just means that this book is really character-driven, and I like that. If you prefer police procedurals with lots of ensemble work, or thrillers with international action, this will be somewhat less your speed, although there is plenty of weaponry to keep you happy too. (It isn't too much of a spoiler to say that the climax features hand grenades.)

US	53030634	R3QQ7H8EU45M7R	076530693X	193033614	Gunpowder Empire (Crosstime Traffic)	Books	4	6	6	N	Y	Homage to H. Beam Piper, and juvie coming-of-age	This book is, first and foremost, a teenage coming-of-age novel. You know the kind: teenagers meet challenges that would bother adults, overcome them and prove that the young make better adults than the adults themselves. Trite, but can be entertaining. If you take it in that spirit, as a coming of age novel that happens to be SF, it's 4-star.<br />The second thing that this book is, is an homage to H. Beam Piper. If you haven't already read Piper's _Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen_ and the Paratime stories, I'll go ahead and wait while you check those out and read them. OK, done that? Little bit on the sexist side for 2004's taste, but consider when they were written; for their time (the fifties), having Hadron Dalla be as active a character as she is in a science fiction novel was quite unusual, so Piper was doing a good job of thinking outside the usual parameters. Now, with Verkan Vall and Hadron Dalla in mind, you can see why Turtledove chose to have both a boy and a girl protagonist, and to have the girl chafe at restrictions.<br />You should also go ahead and read Turtledove and Tarr's _Household Gods_ to get an incredibly deep feel for daily life in ancient Rome. That one's definitely not a juvenile. It's a time travel story, rather than an alternate history. In that book, our protagonist has a son and daughter, younger than the teenagers in this book. So we have a pair of brackets - the children in Household Gods, and the adults in Piper's books. That gives us an understanding about why Turtledove would choose to fill in the gap between those two.<br />All that said - and boy, it sounds like I'm doing a book report, compare and contrast, doesn't it? - this IS still a juvie, and adult readers are still going to find it a bit lightweight. Since it's being sold as alt-history, not as a juvie, I would give it a 3-star rating: it's not bad, but it's not as good as I was expecting, or what I was expecting. I didn't really want to spend that much time reading about adolescents emailing each other from different histories.<br />If you're a teenager, though, or an adult who wants just a light read, maybe something you can share with your teenagers to get them more into SF, or even to assign to a class, both for reading purposes and for discussions of real Roman history, and of Latin. For those purposes it would be a five-star. Hence my four-star average.<br />The homage to Piper shows in the title, the characters, and details. Cross-time secret instead of Paratime secret, but the same secrecy. The disguise of traders as a way to get in and out of a more primitive culture. I expect we'll see more details that echo Piper in the future volumes of this series. I will be reading them - it's good enough for that - although I might opt for the paperbacks. In any event, it's good to see Turtledove do something besides his interminable alt-Civil-War, alt-WW2 series, which have been dragged out way too long if you're not someone who likes endless battle strategy scenes. This book has a few of those, but it's a different kind of war.<br />In short? Buy it for a teen interested in SF, or for someone who particularly has an interest in the Roman Empire; read it yourself too, and enjoy it as long as you don't expect great depth.olescents emailing each other from different histories.<br />If you're a teenager, though, or an adult who wants just a light read, maybe something you can share with your teenagers to get them more into SF, or even to assign to a class, both for reading purposes and for discussions of real Roman history, and of Latin.

As always, a great story with great characters	Miller &amp; Lee are among the few authors, along with Lois M. Bujold, whom I will purchase in hardcover the day they come out with a new book. I have not been disappointed in the past, and I'm not disappointed now.<br />If you haven't read others in their Liaden series, you can still read this and enjoy it - it's perfectly good cultural space opera (as contrasted to military space opera) in its own right. It's even more fun, though, if you read the other books as well. This one takes place in a setting slightly earlier, chronologically, than the books featuring Clan Korval, and has no characters in common - Korval is mentioned only once, in passing, as a clan that breeds pilots. So you don't have to know the back-story on all the characters in the previous books in order to know what the characters in this one are doing. There are some customs, however, which will strike you as odd if you haven't already been immersed in this universe.<br />Someone else described this as a coming of age novel, and in part it is, but not in a way that limits it to juvenile readers. (I recently read, and reviewed, a coming of age novel by another SF author, which was annoyingly juvenile, so I am pretty sensitive to the issue.) Our young trader apprentice is already a fully developed character in his own right, and the situations he faces are not simple, nor are the adults in the story merely bit players, nor buffoons when faced with youth, as is true of too many such novels.<br />Now, I have to get out of the way one thing I didn't like about this book: the cover art. I hate it. It makes the Terrans look awful, the Liadens look like short Episcopalian bishops in their robes, and further, doesn't seem to me to match the descriptions of the characters at all. There's a note about the artist in the back; I have to respectfully but firmly disagree with his conception of the characters. And with the really awkward poses he's got everyone in! OK, end of that little snit. Back to the story.<br />We start with Jethri Gobelyn, of the trading ship Gobelyn's Market. If you want to dash off and read Christina Rossetti's poem &quot;Goblin Market&quot; you can, but the connections are quite brief and tenuous; the poem won't give you any big clues to the story. There clearly are some clever details drawn from the poem, such as twin girls with names beginning with the same letter, but those details are in no way critical. So feel free NOT to go look up the poem if you hate poetry. Not knowing it won't make you miss out on any big poetic allusions in the book.<br />Jethri's family is slightly hillbilly - his name resembles Jethro not for nothing. They talk with country accents, they hold shivarees (spelled shivary here), and they have some risk of inbreeding... and I thought at first that I would be annoyed by that, because I don't like stereotypes like that - but they turned out not to be stereotypical hillbillies at all; they're great characters. Jethri's extended group of cousins are smarter than they look.<br />The last part of Jethri's secret becomes revealed only near the end of the book, although there are hints regarding it which may lead you to guess earlier. Let's just say that they make the question of &quot;coming of age&quot; more complicated.<br />There is also a family of Russians involved in slightly shady dealings, again not quite the stereotypes; Grigory, his sister Raisana (think Raisa Gorbacheva if you didn't recognize Raisana as a Russian name) and their uncle Yuri have some surprises up their sleeves.<br />Let's see, for those already involved in the series, some differences to note: no Yxtrang, not even a mention of them. Some technology from an earlier civilization that we haven't seen in the other books; this technology is described as unstable, so perhaps by the later books the last fractins have become useless. In some ways, I saw glimpses of the authors' other series, about Gem ser Edreth, in the Gobelyns - I could see the shipboardculture of these Terran trading ships sliding into the completely shipborn culture of the gen ships there, with both the culture and the physiology changing from the human norm. Even though these are two completely different series, there's a resemblance. There's also no noticeable romance in this book, no dramatic meetings of couples like Shan and Priscilla or Val Con and Miri. Closest to romance we get is Grig's girlfriend announcing she's pregnant, and we didn't get any details before that.<br />No military battles in this one; it's strictly trading and education. We don't even spend much time on ship, rather mostly on stations and on mud. When Jethri finds himself on a Liaden trade ship as an apprentice, he has to learn more Liaden than he knows, and has to learn all the various shades of bows. Those who are old enough to remember Keith Laumer's Retief series may remember the endless list of numbered facial expressions that the Corps Diplomatique had, after a while! Jethri runs across a Scout, with an odd sense of humor, as the Scouts always seem to have, but also meets a regular Liaden with a sense of humor, which is somewhat rarer. While Korval's always had an odd kick in its gallop, most of the other Liaden characters have been a bit humor-impaired; Tam Sin, however, has a full sense of the humor in irony and coincidence. For that matter, we do also meet a Scout with no sense of humor, also a rarity. Even Scouts, apparently, can be narrow-minded bigots more concerned with title, position, and perks than with curiosity.<br />There's a very nice cat in the book. Pay attention to Flinx, he's important!<br />I hope that's enough hints as to the characters and plot to get you reading.

It's not quite perfect - there's one or two coincidences too many - but it's quite good.<br />I started reading this series with this book, then had to go back and get the others, to get all of the context. It's a good series, but it definitely makes more sense read in order. In the first volume, Brian and Emma don't have a house yet, and Emma has just started working with Meg. Kamil and Marty meet in the first book. If you start with this (the third book), you have no idea of what all the references are to past trouble that they've seen together, and there are many such references. So do go ahead and get Site Unseen and Grave Consequences.<br />A tiny nitpick is that Cameron's police seem to blur together; it's hard to tell the fairly intelligent cop in one volume from a different cop in the other. Not that it's a bad thing - it's a nice change of pace from other authors' series where all the police are buffoons all the time!<br />The relationship between archaeologist Emma and her chemist husband Brian is well-described; it includes a realistic view of why many archaeologists, in real life, don't have successful marriages. (I hear from zoologists, too, that they have the same problems. They are both in professions that require a lot of field work, often in dangerous places. If one's spouse isn't disgruntled that one is away from home so often, then he or she is disgruntled that the other throws himself or herself into danger just for the sake of a find, all too often.)<br />Emma is at a site fairly close to home, in this one; her student assistants are staying at her house, and she and they drive to the site each day. This has its advantages and its disadvantages for Brian. We get to hear a little bit more about mealtimes than I personally found interesting, but your tastes may vary (pardon the pun).<br />There are relatively few bodies in this one, compared to the first in the series. There are the usual cast of eccentrics - the neighbors, the Bellamys, are stuck up and trying to get the dig shut down; there's someone far too concerned with whether his ancestry is perfect. There aren't any out and out nutsos such as Tichnor in the first book, which is fine with me - authors who depend on crazy people for motives all the time are lazy, I feel, so it's nice to have good old-fashioned greed instead.<br />Emma's sister Bucky is visiting, and she joins in on the field work; she's a nice character, a veterinarian with some gaps in her social skills. We get some development in the relationship between the sisters, and learn a bit more about their family history. (As Emma has pointed out, their mother's personality may be why neither Emma nor Bucky is much of a people person, Emma preferring to work with dead people and Bucky preferring to work with animals. I can understand that!)<br />As usual, you'll learn something about archaeology and something about architecture in New England, along with learning who dunnit!, the Bellamys, are stuck up and trying to get the dig shut down; there's someone far too concerned with whether his ancestry is perfect.

Alternate history and space opera, yes, but not completely either one. I am a big fan of alt-history.<br />The alternate history part is, the Aztec conquered the world (and, as a rather odd side note, apparently separate, Jesus had a sister, who is as revered as the the Virgin Mother is). But the story takes place enough into the future in space exploration that all of that is background, and the main plot is secret weapons from previous galactic empires gone for millions of years. The way that Aztec mythology colors the people's way of thinking is interesting, as are the racial conflicts- the Nisei and Skawts (yes, that's Scots) retained more of their independence than most other cultures, while the English are nonexistent (the Duchy of Kent is an area of Skawtland) - the main languages (besides Nahuatl) are Norman and Japanese. If you are, as I am, interested in the development of languages, and comparisons between existing languages from their roots, you'll have fun with this. There doesn't seem to be any Italy, nor any remnants of Latin as a language, which I found interesting; there are people who are Maltese, and I'm wondering if that includes Italy rather than just the island of Malta in our universe. A lack of a Rome, to spread its version of Christianity, would explain some of the reasons that Europe is less warlike than others, and would explain no Spaniards and Portuguese conquering the New World. Teasing this sort of thing out from the background scenery is fun.<br />Suprisingly, the mystical elements didn't bother me much, even though I am not a big fantasy fan nor do I think much of psychic powers or mind reading. I didn't find them obtrusive, and some of the seemingly mystical stuff was given a plausible cover of drugs. I guess my attitude is that in this book it's easy enough to ignore them; one could skip over the shamanistic stuff lightly and still enjoy the vast majority of the book, and not miss any major plot elements.<br />A few little inconsistencies but nothing that really interrupts the flow of believing in the possibility of this history (for example, we alternate randomly between spelling Tukhachevsky's nationality as Russian and Rossiyan).<br />Incidentally, another reviewer mentioned that they hadn't read any other Aztec alt-histories; I recommend L. Neil Smith's _The Crystal Empire_ as one such, if you enjoy the idea. It's very different from this book, but quite a good complement, two very different possibilities. There are several other alt-hists where the Aztecs are still a major world power albeit not the world's rulers; if I can find them in our house (family motto: I know it's in here *somewhere*) I will do a List of them for your reading pleasure.<br />A few other incidentals which some people may want to know about: yes there are aliens, but they are not a major part of the plot, although one such is one of our main characters. No, there's almost no romance, and no sex scenes at all - many space operas have a large helping of romance, but this isn't one of them. No, we don't have any major scenes of bloody violence, no giant gun battles in outer space nor hand to hand combat on the ground; the war here is cultural, and such bad guys as there are, are not total evil villians; resolution of that subplot is interesting but does not depend on armies and strength of weapons.

First let me say that after you read this book, you should then read Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, which is its logical successor.<br />Second: this book was written in the 1930's. This is before much of what we know about modern antibiotics was discovered - but that's one of the reasons you should read it: a reminder of just how recent modern medicine is, and how much power disease still has over us. This book is a stark reminder of how much hygiene has done to lengthen our lifespan, too - improving water supplies and eliminating rats from most households has done as much or more to extend the human lifespan as all the antibiotics we've invented.<br />Zinsser's list of what historical battles would have ended completely differently had not epidemic disease swept through one or another army is also chilling reading. Much of what we think of as inevitable human superiority was actually the work of bacteria, who didn't really care about our affairs. But despite the gloomy topic, as my title says, this book is the most fun you can possibly have while reading about epidemics. His humor is dry and biting - the deadpan recital of damages here, of misguided so-called scientists there... the editorial review above gives a couple such examples. The entire book is a fascinating read.<br />Some of the writing assumes that all readers were educated under an aristocratic university system, so that there are bits thrown in in Latin and Greek, not to mention French and other modern languages. The book can be read despite those, however. It might be tough going for high school students or even university undergrads, but would be a terrific addition to a history research paper, worth the slog for anyone willing to try it. And for those who have medicine and/or biology as an amateur interest, this is must reading.	2003-11-10

The \\"Kevin Kerney\\" series has a back-story (the background contains evolving information about the lives of the characters which has nothing to do with the plot) but each book is also quite readable on its own. The mystery plot is good enough to carry even the new reader along.<br />Nonetheless, I'd certainly recommend that you read the whole series- they are all interesting. _Serpent Gate_ and _Under the Color of Law_ are especially good, in my opinion. Worth your while to read them.<br />In _Everyone Dies_, we have a continuation of the backstory of Kevin's son, whom he only recently discovered existed. Kevin gets to know his son better - and to work with him, on this case.<br />The plot: a gay lawyer gets murdered, right in front of his office. One of the questions: is it because he's gay, or because he's a lawyer, or some other reason the police have no idea of? One small bit of stereotyping I could have lived without: the lawyer's life partner owns an antiques shop. Personally, I would like to see authors stop casting gay characters in antiques and interior decorating. That's a small quibble, however- it doesn't spoil the book.<br />Besides the gay community in Santa Fe, we also get to deal with the mentally ill community - always a challenge for the police. We have social workers who are sure that their clients are ALWAYS wronged innocents; questions about how well the laws about screening gun purchasers work; and whether police get enough training in how to approach the mentally ill. Where I live, Austin, we've had a couple of incidents in the past couple of years, of a police officer shooting a mentally ill person who turned out to be unarmed. These incidents are still \\"under review\\" and nothing much has changed. However, when this happens in the book, Kerney is quickly on the ball about changing his force's policy and vowing to improve training. (Makes one wish reality would learn a few lessons from fiction, sigh.)<br />The next character murdered seems to have no connection whatsoever with the first murder. More murders follow, and some are accompanied by personal notes to Kerney. Eventually, Kerney and his staff figure out the connection - and then the race is to catch the killer before the trend continues.

US	53030634	RU8NPREVNTCPO	0449007189	446353596	A Fashionable Murder	Books	4	3	4	N	Y	I liked this one; the setting's different, though.	Josie Pigeon is a bit out of her element in New York City, but that's part of the plot. Her son has a great time in NY. Sam's mother Carol is a much bigger character in this novel than in the previous ones in the series.<br />We meet Josie's former employee Betty again. We don't meet Sam's former girlfriend Pamela Peel - because she's dead before we can be introduced. And Sam is a suspect.<br />There was a bit much about the shopping joys of NYC, but then, that is Carol Birnbaum's view of life. The stuff about interior decorating- Pamela's profession - was interesting. But my favorite is the inside views of several very different salons, from Elizabeth Arden to a New Age place; the gossip and bitchiness of the employees rings true. The struggles of various New Yorkers to make it in their chosen professions is a theme throughout the book.<br />Let's see, to intrigue you: Sam's brown reading chair plays an important role in this mystery. And, this is not a spoiler since it has nothing to do with solving the mystery or saying who-dun-it: Josie proposes to Sam at the end. So you definitely don't want to miss this one in the series! It's not the best, but it is good, and it is fun.	2003-07-25
US	53030634	R34FL7XWJI4TYP	1892065037	904953442	I Dare (Liaden Universe Novel Series)	Books	5	27	27	N	Y	Definitely the best in the series so far!!! Great!!!	This is, depending on how you count, the seventh novel in the Liaden Universe series. However, Meisha Merlin published two novels, _Local Custom_ and _Scout's Progress_, as one volume (entitled _Pilot's Choice_), and another three novels as one volume, so depending on what editions one buys, there are only four volumes so far. The authors predict a total of seven volumes, so we have more to look forward to. And this book certainly leaves one eager to order anything and everything else they care to write in the series!<br />It's a good idea, if you're not familiar with the series, to read them all; while this is a rousing good space opera in its own right, it is even better if you have followed the series. You could get by without the _Pilot's Choice_ volume, but you really need, at the very least, _Agent of Change_, _Carpe Diem_, and _Plan B_ to get the most out of _I Dare_. Agent and Carpe are two of the three novels in the _Partners in Necessity_ volume, so if you get that, you'll get _Conflict of Honors_ too. That's the first one I ever read of the series, initially published as individual paperbacks.<br />The series starts with Er Thom yos'Galen and Daav yos'Phelium, in _Local Custom_ and _Scout's Progress_. _Conflict_ takes up with Shan yos'Galen, Er Thom and Anne's son. _Agent_ takes up Val Con yos'Phelium, Daav and Aelliana's son. The rest of the books so far, including _I Dare_, continue to follow Shan and Val Con, and the various employees, friends and lifemates they drag into the ongoing story of Clan Korval. In _I Dare_ many of the separate threads from the previous volumes come together. We have the Juntavas, the interstellar Mob who actively appeared in _Agent_; we have the return of Daav; we have also Shan and Val Con's cousin Pat Rin as a major character. (That's Val Con and Pat Rin on the cover.) Surebleak, the planet Miri Robertson was born on, suddenly shows up again. Korval has already noticed that the Department of the Interior is trying to take over Liad and eliminate their family; in this book, Korval actively confronts the Department.<br />A large chunk of the book is taken up with battles and battle strategy; however, this didn't turn me off, even though I'm not that gung-ho on war stories. And there's a larger element of fantasy in this book than in the previous ones, in that more and more people turn out to have psychic powers. I'm not that much of a fan of psychic powers, but I didn't mind them here- it's just one element that keeps the story moving right along. The plot is extremely brisk; don't skip a page!<br />The end of the book does contain what seems to be a clear lead-in to a next book, since a new character shows up... I won't give away the details. One of the nice things about this book, and this whole series, is that there could be short stories written about it for years to come, because there are so many interesting characters. What exactly was Daav doing all those years at a Terran university? Whatever happened to Aelliana Caylon's younger sister? Can we find out more about Richard Davis, Anne's brother and Shan's uncle? Did Vin Sin chel'Mara ever reform after being exiled? More about Clonak ter'Muelen! Oh, and Nova yos'Galen - by the end of this book, all the current generation are lifemated save her; does she ever get true love? There are a few short stories that were only ever published in chapbooks; if Miller and Lee would write a couple more short stories, there'd be enough for an anthology, and I'd be sure to read it.<br />It's difficult to convey how much I like this series, and I like this book the best so far.

OK, if you don't read any of the romance genre, the term Regency romance will mean nothing to you. If, however, you do read Regency romances, then this is the science fiction book for you!<br />The book is good even if one isn't a romance reader - there's plenty of plot, snappy dialogue, and seat-of-the-pants spaceship flying, as one would want in Space Opera.<br />But let me describe the romance part of the plot, so that Regency readers can see that indeed, this book hits every one of the cliches of the genre - and does it quite well, too! Let's see. Girl lives at home with cruel older brother, who has previously married her off to one of his equally cruel and abusive friends, and threatens to marry her off to another such unless she is completely submissive to him. Older sister thinks marriages of convenience are fine, for money and heirs - that's what's normal, after all. Younger sister is smart-alec brat, intelligent, but too young to really understand the tensions going on about marriage. Girl teaches at school; she's a math genius, but has virtually no public recognition. She goes out with some of her students to a gambling hell - er, hall - and winds up winning a spaceship from a card sharp. (The card sharp's family eventually finds out that he has fleeced many other young members of the nobility, and that's why so many other noble families aren't talking to them; he gets banished to the Americas  - er, to a farm planet, with a distant aunt.) She decides to learn to pilot, and thus escape from her family and earn her own living. Who should wind up giving Aelliana piloting lessons but Daav, who doesn't give her his last name - because he's actually a member of the top aristocracy, who doesn't want to intimidate her or scare her off.<br />Older brother eventually finds out about her winnings, demands they all be turned over to him, and when she refuses, punishes her, locking her in. Daav, however, finds her home, and rescues her. Mother disowns Aelliana's brother. Everyone else lives happily ever after.<br />The card game she wins is called pikit, and I can hear the Regency readers saying \\"shouldn't that be spelled piquet?\\" The casino even has a stakes book. And there are characters named Per Sea, and Sed Rik (Percy and Cedric), and indeed, most of the characters in this book have names that are far closer to traditional \\"English\\" names, than the other Liaden Universe novels do. They really jump out at one.<br />Now, the science fiction bits: this is, in internal chronology, the second novel in the Liaden Universe series, although it is one of the later ones published - _Conflict of Honors_, _Agent of Change_, and _Carpe Diem_ came out long before this one, while _Local Custom_ came out at about the same time. Conflict, Agent, and Carpe concern the offspring of the characters in Scout's and Local. The entire Liaden series is space opera, extremely well done, with large doses of cultural anthropology that really make the societies involved seem complete, and the conflicts seem real. Liadens are a race of humans, but not Earth humans - at this point, it is still being argued among the various planets as to whether Terrans, Liadens, and Yxtrang are all from the same original stock; the companion book to this one, _Local Custom_, discusses that issue in more detail. This particular book in the series has much less space travel than the others. Keep your eye out for navigational computers and sleep-learning machines. It really doesn't matter whether you read this one or _Local Custom_ first, but it's a good idea to read both, before starting in on the next generation, even though the next generation ones were published first. That's always a dilemma with series books - publishing order or internal chronology?<br />The authors show a terrific sense of humor, and a great hand with dialogue. (Oh, and for readers who still have no idea what \\"regency\\" refers to, think Napoleonic War era, think Patrick O'Brien's Aubrey and Maturin series recast as romances.) If you like this book, then you will be addicted to them all.eries recast as romances.) If you like this book, then you will be addicted to them all.	2003-07-20
US	53030634	R3HWASDPBL16QL	0972109803	823096418	Blood Is Thicker Than Water	Books	4	41	47	N	Y	Not bad at all, but it has a few flaws.	This is not your average vampire book. It definitely has some plot elements that are unique to this author. It was quite enjoyable; what kept me from giving it five stars is the lack of proofreading and copy-editing.<br />Let's see, BunRab's usual analysis of vampire books:<br />Is it part of a series? It claims to be the first one in a series; the back page says that Book Two is \\"coming soon.\\"<br />What's the author's main genre? I haven't read anything else by this author; she doesn't, as far as I know, write any other types of fantasy or science fiction, nor murder mysteries, nor in the romance genres. This book has some romance features in it, but is definitely not a romance per se.<br />Vampire powers: Does daylight kill these vampires? Direct sunlight does; indirect (e.g., being awake but inside during the day) doesn't. Do the vampires have any supernatural powers? The usual ones of supernatural strength, and being able to make people not see them. Also, telepathy occurs in most of them. In addition, they have the power to create \\"thralls,\\" humans who have tasted some of their blood and are therefore longer-lived and faster-healing than other humans. Oh, and they can also enthrall dogs!<br />Do the vampires need to drink blood? Does it have to be human? Yes, and yes. Most lines of vampires exist only on blood, and need to feed every day, therefore; the line of vampires, or clan or family, whatever you want to call it, that are our main characters are unusual in that they can still eat regular food, and can get up to 2/3 of their sustenance from regular food, needing only about 1/3 of their intake to be blood.<br />Does drinking the blood have to do with sex? Are vampires a metaphor for humanity's sexual fears? Yes, and no. Drinking blood can involve sex, and apparently is better for the vampires if it does, but they can feed without it, and can leave the humans not remembering that they were fed on. Vampires actually have personalities of their own, and are not merely dark, brooding and evil- although some other families than our heroes' do seem to specialize in evil and death, it isn't a requirement for being a vampire.<br />The book is not deadly serious (pardon the pun) but has several touches of humor. There are sibling squabbles and long-standing family jokes, there are amusing moments in the Pagan shop that Paul and Marcie run; even a few of the vampires and thralls have senses of humor. The tone is not entirely different from Laurell Hamilton's earlier books, before they turned entirely to sex. There are serious and deadly moments, but also light-hearted ones.<br />Now, if only someone would run off a second edition, in which the lack of commas in many places got fixed, while some of the run-on sentences with too many commas got turned into separate sentences, or at least had a few semi-colons added, and if the occasional use of \\"hadn't of\\" were fixed, and the kind of word substitutions that spell-check doesn't catch (too for to, it's for its, and so forth) were corrected by a human proofreader (or a vampire one, for that matter- just not a computer one!)

The story line contains the worst mishmash of vampire lore and off-the-wall Greek mythology I have ever seen. The plot is inconsistent, the dialogue so-so at best, and the resemblance to real vampire novels pretty close to non-existent.<br />I will admit that there was one amusing concept that I liked: when Kyrian has to go somewhere in the daytime, he gets protected from daylight by calling an ambulance and being carried out in a body bag. This, however, is a couple of pages in a thick-ish book; certainly not worth reading the entire book just to get this bit.<br />I would hesitate to read another book by this author, after my experience with this one... In my opinion, she should stick to non-fantasy romance.	2003-07-10

Scented candles are assault weapons - as are tote bags.<br />This book is slightly more about Diana than about Claire. Diana and Claire have to share Sam, as Austin gets left behind with Dean. There's also a mummy and an absent-minded professor, an over-enthusiastic grad student, an anime-hero reincarnation of King Arthur, and the third-floor elevator that opens onto the beach. (No giant not-a-squids actually show up, however.) Hell is as sarcastic as ever.<br />If you didn't understand the above references, you probably haven't read the first two books in the series. I would recommend buying them and reading them all in order. Some in-jokes will go right by you if you don't. If you prefer your fantasy solemn and serious, and your elves with long unpronounceable names and bows-and-arrows, this may not be your kind of book- the whole series has a sense of humor, as do Huff's other books. While we do have quests to save the world, the characters are not terribly solemn about it all.<br />Keepers have powers that help keep the balance in the world between good and evil; normal people (muggles, I suppose) are Bystanders. In the first book, Claire, a Keeper, meets Dean, a Bystander. By the end of the second book, Claire and Dean have inherited a hotel, and Claire's younger sister, Diana, is revealed to have greater Keeper powers than Claire or either of their parents. So for this third book, Diana and Claire team up on a mission. Sam and Austin are their respective cats. The plot itself is the usual - a gate of some sort between Hell and this world is getting larger and strange things are getting through, to generalize the plots of all three books. In this case, the location is a shopping mall.<br />It's a fun, reasonably fast read, with a few new twists to liven up its universe. So far, Huff is proving that she can handle that generalized plot line over and over again without boring an audience!	2003-06-21

So here's some of the standard questions:<br />Is this part of a series? Yes, it's the third one in the series.<br />What genre does the author mainly write in? Mysteries, in this case, and there is always a mystery/murder element in the vampire books.<br />Can the vampires stand sunlight? Very, very little exposure, but it's not zero.<br />Do the vampires drink actual blood? Yes, and it may or may not be associated with sex; humans drinking vampire blood get benefits as well, such as faster healing- and glowing in the dark, although that's a dubious benefit.<br />Do the vampires have special powers? Yes, most can float in the air, some can fly; most are stronger than humans.<br />Are there other supernatural elements in the books? Yes, there are werewolves and other shape-shifters, and the ongoing argument over who gets to call themselves a were and who doesn't is amusing. We also get introduced, in this book, to a goblin (named Hob, of course), and there are mentions of other supernatural elements.<br />Is there a lot of sex? Are vampires symbolic representations of sexual fears? No, and no. There's a little bit of sex, and a certain amount of discussion about it, but it's not the main point of the books. Vampires are not just representations of humanity's sexual fears; they are active, working people, well, active, working undead, anyway, with characters and lives. They don't exist just to be evil, or just to attack the unsuspecting. As with Laurell Hamilton's series, owning nightclubs is a popular occupation for vampires.<br />This series exists in what is mainly our real world, not a fantasy world, except there happen to be vampires. Vampire rights are still being debated, now that they are legally recognized at all. Vampires have their own system of governance, which is pretty antiquated for modern times, and adapting to living under regular law as well as their own codes is an ongoing struggle.<br />In this particular book, our heroine, Sookie Stackhouse, spends more time with Eric, and with a bunch of werewolves, than she does with Bill - in fact, the book starts with a serious breakup with Bill. Also, Sookie finally gets new gravel on her driveway.<br />There is a sense of humor evident in Harris' writing, and I suspect that those who like Tanya Huff's books about Henry Fitzroy will enjoy this series as well; on the other hand, if you are into dark, brooding, vampires with evil attitudes toward humans - we won't mention any names here - then this book may not be your cup of tea.quated for modern times, and adapting to living under regular law as well as their own codes is an ongoing struggle.<br />In this particular book, our heroine, Sookie Stackhouse, spends more time with Eric, and with a bunch of werewolves, than she does with Bill - in fact, the book starts with a serious breakup with Bill.

(That other book is \\"The Essential Guide to Prescription Drugs\\") The main reason this one is popular is because it's good, and the price is great. Anyone who wants to be active in managing their health care, not just a passive recipient of doctors' orders, should own such a book.<br />Advantages:<br />Small and lightweight enough to carry with you to the doctor's office or the pharmacy to discuss. (That other book is larger and much heavier.)<br />Includes almost all classes of drugs, including some that other book doesn't, and even some injections and inhalers.<br />Extremely complete lists of potential side effects.<br />List of the top 200 prescribed drugs in the US.<br />Articles in the rear of book include \\"Drugs against Terrorism.\\"<br />Inexpensive - the price is fantastically good for the amount of information in the book!<br />Disadvantages:<br />Includes only US brand names, and doesn't have some of them (the brand of digoxin I take, for example, is not listed.)<br />The section of pictures of pills is pretty useless (I feel the same about the pictures in that other book, too.) Since it doesn't have them all, why bother?<br />In Summary: This book costs less than the typical copay on your insurance for a single prescription, and will be more than worth it to you in terms of information.	2003-06-02

Took me a while because I could only take a couple chapters per dose. That's because the book tries too darn hard to be clever. And winds up overdoing it. Mad scientists AND time travel AND puns AND alternate history AND sly references to other SF for the cognoscenti AND British bureaucratic farce AND love story AND oh so clever character names...<br />There was a dessert I got at a restaurant once that reminded me of this. It was a chocolate fudge cake with caramel, coconut, pecans, whipped cream, and dark chocolate frosting. Delicious, right? Except, they served it on a plate with both raspberry and white chocolate sauces drizzled over it, and a sprig of mint leaf on it. I told the waiter to tell the chef that they should have left off the trim - it was distracting. At that point, one more flavor would only get lost, if it were weak, or muddy the waters, if strong. And that's what this book felt like- somebody drizzled a few too many sauces on the cake. It was so clever I found myself saying \\"stop already with the 27th Division of Special Ops, and get on with the plot!\\"<br />The universe it's set in is an alternate history where the Crimean War is still going on 130 years later, into the 1980's. Airplanes haven't been developed; air travel is by dirigible. Our heroine, Thursday Next, is an operative in the literary fraud division of Special Ops. Her dad is a rogue time-travelling former Special Ops man. One of the villains is named Acheron Hades, to give you an idea of where the names are going. Her mom still lives back in their home town, with the spare rooms occupied by a mad scientist/inventor and his wife.<br />That's enough for you to decide whether you want to get started on this mish-mash. It *is* very funny, and there *are* some interesting premises along the way, and it *is* full of fun references to other books. There's just a little too much raspberry sauce on it, though.	2003-04-15
US	53030634	R2BNGYMQ6NGNQA	1892065878	475011999	The Tomorrow Log	Books	5	41	43	N	Y	Fans of Miller & Lee will not be disappointed!	First off, let's say up front that this is space opera. There are grand themes of good vs. evil, spaceship battles, etc. If you are looking for the latest in cyberpunk, you are in the wrong department. Second, let's say that although this is a new series by Lee & Miller, it doesn't have any amazing new themes- no startling insights into the nature of the universe, none of the newest discoveries in physics; just their usual themes of the problems with insular cultures, how human(ish) hybrids tend to be more vigorous and smarter than those who are inbred, how people change if they are accidentally placed outside the culture they are grown up in, and of course, romance based on the admiration of the significant other's intelligence and battle skills (regardless of gender). Mind you, I am emphatically NOT belittling those themes- I like them, and I think this pair of authors handles those themes well. I just don't want to say merely \\"great new science fiction!\\" and then have disappointed fans of dark and bitter techno-futures email me, saying \\"Thou hast deceived me!\\" Come to think of it, if you're the sort of person who ever likes to throw \\"Thou hast\\" into conversation, you won't be emailing me, 'cause I'm preaching to the choir- you'll like this book. Unlike the Liaden Universe (r) series, the language in this book does not actually get that formal, but you can tell that it could. (Yes, yes, I know that \\"thou\\" is actually the familiar form, not the formal, but that's not how most people today know of it.)<br />What we have is well-written, fast-paced adventure with wonderfully drawn characters. Gem is not a Val Con clone, despite the fact that a casual reading of the short blurbs might make him sound that way. The plot includes, let's see, \\"haunted\\" objects to be stolen, an interplanetary Mob (not that dissimilar to the one in the Liaden books), a generation ship that's falling apart, recycled bodies and parts a la Harry Harrison, martial arts, mystical objects that turn out to be alien technology, the Witness (who certainly reminded me somehow of Nelirikk Explorer, I can't figure out why) who follows the object around, interlocking mysterious \\"prophecies\\" from several cultures... and lots of hints of the future of the series, as well, since the planet where the object is returned, turns out to have mysterious hints that a Gen ship may have landed there aeons ago.<br />There is one somewhat intriguing idea- not brand new, but I like the way they do it, and that's \\"spiders\\" - small electronic spy devices.

US	53030634	R77B91RBXPAMB	0520219538	342917160	Evolution of Sickness and Healing	Books	4	4	4	N	N	Dry and academic but intriguing and useful	I stumbled across this book from the University of California Press when I was looking for source material on \\"societal development.\\" If you're a graduate student at certain universities, you'll recognize that general topic as something you may have to write 30 or 60 pages on someday. As it later happened, my \\"breadth\\" paper on societal development went in a different direction, but this book was interesting reading anyway.<br />Fabrega discusses how our view of illness has changed, how our treatment of illness have changed, and how different societies have different views of illness. For example, things treated as medical disorders in Western society - obesity, cosmetic defects - may not be treated as a medical issue at all in other societies. He also discusses the possibility that humans have specifically evolved an adaptation for sickness and healing, which he calls the SH adaptation. That is, that there have been evolutionary advantages to some people in being sick, and advantages to other people in being the sort of person who helps the sick. This point of view can be compared with Robert Sapolsky's (_Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers_) since both Fabrega and Sapolsky discuss illness in our primate cousins, the chimpanzees. Fabrega's approach is more ethonological/anthropological, while Sapolsky's is more biology, and Sapolsky's book is written more for a popular audience. Both have interesting things to say about our perception of and treatment of mental illnesses. One could completely round out a paper about how society shapes the concept of illness, and how diseases, epidemics, etc. have shaped society, by reading Jared Diamond's _Guns, Germs and Steel_ and, if one had time, Hans Zinsser's _Rats, Lice and History_, an \\"autobiography\\" of typhus.<br />Chapter subtitles include: *\\"Sickness and Healing and the Problem of Social Change and Evolution;\\" \\"Conjuring Up the Archaeology and Prehistory of Sickness and Healing;\\" \\"Sickness Cheating;\\" \\"Sickness and Healing in Chiefdom, Prestate, and State Societies;\\" \\"The Higher Prevalence of Psychiatric Disorders\\" and so on. There are discussions of traditional Chinese medicine, the Islamic view of medicine and healing, and other non-Western aspects, so that this book is not limited to \\"Western\\" medicine.<br />This wouldn't be the very first book I'd read on the topic- it's academic enough to scare off a casual reader - but it's definitely an interesting resource for those interested in how society is reflected by its treatment of the sick.iefdom, Prestate, and State Societies;\\" \\"The Higher Prevalence of Psychiatric Disorders\\" and so on.

Booo-ring! We just don't need a list of a couple hundred euphemisms for having sex, which didn't even include some of my favorites, and some of which haven't been used in a couple hundred years. I did like the preliminary commentary to this particular list, though, pointing out that many of the euphemisms are far more explicit than the bare-bones phrase they were meant to replace.<br />Trivia about religion and death is interesting. I enjoyed reading about the steps in a medical-legal autopsy; if you are a murder-mystery reader, you'll like that too. Other lists I enjoyed: 20 alleged cases of backwards phrases in recordings, along with an explanation of how such phrases might occur. Reasons to believe that Paul was dead. (If you don't understand that phrase, you're the wrong generation anyway.) Movie anachronisms. Longest movies ever made.<br />The lists about sex will probably appeal more to some people than they did to me, so my reaction shouldn't discourage you from buying this. It's a great sort of book to keep in the bathroom so that you can read a couple of pages at a time and then put it down.	2002-09-20
US	53030634	R1QJ9Z5E3UV5T2	189389651X	256035354	Switched	Books	4	12	14	N	Y	Is it romance or is it science fiction? Yes.	This is an amusing book, lightweight in both the genres it tries for - romance and science fiction - but not at all a waste of time. There are quite a few in-jokes for SF fans, several nice traditional cliches for romance fans, and a few jokes from other areas. For example, the name of our captain is Marcus Aurelius Viator. Leaving aside entirely the question of why aliens would be naming their children after Earth Romans, the name is certainly appropriate. Marcus Aurelius was, of course, the famous Stoic, Roman emperor during the 2nd century C.E., and knowing this telegraphs to the knowledgeable that our character is attempting to be a stoic person. Viator is a great name for a starship captain too, since it translates roughly as \\"traveller\\" (the latin via is a road - so this is \\"one who uses the roads.\\")<br />Other characters include the ship's engineer, who has watched a lot of broadcasts of ST:TOS (oh, OK: Star Trek, the original show) whenever the ship swings near earth, and decided to talk like Scotty, deliberately, to annoy the captain. An alien engineer doing Scotty is a nice touch.<br />The ship's security office is named Hrvibm - funny enough in spelling, funnier if you pronounce it Harvey-bem, where BEM is the traditional acronym for \\"Bug-eyed monster\\" a favorite in pulp fiction of the golden age.<br />There's a scene with aliens involved in a DEA raid; there's also a chase up a college bell tower which will remind you of many gothic horror novels and movies. There is a geek teenaged genius brother - our heroine at first thinks that the events that happen to her are a prank by his Trekker friends.<br />There's a pretty good underlying theme exploring nature versus nurture - can't tell you more without giving away the plot, but it does give food for thought, and in the end both nature and nurture win out - we find that both are important.<br />There are a couple of annoying affectations - the word the crew calls their communicators is link, and it is italicized every time it appears, as though we wouldn't recognize what it means, as if it's really a foreign word. Sorta pointless given that this emphasis is not used for anything else on the ship, no matter how alien.<br />For the romance fans, we have a comedy of errors with twins - complete with clothing exchanges, etc.<br />The writing is not the best - this is not great literature - but it's good enough to make you snicker, and occasionally quote bits out loud to the unfortunate significant other who is trying to get to sleep.licized every time it appears, as though we wouldn't recognize what it means, as if it's really a foreign word.

Character development is as important as plot, and if you don't know where the characters are coming from, some of their reactions in this book will not make sense to you. That said, let's assume that you go back, order all of them from the beginning, catch up on your reading, and are now ready for this one:<br />Lieutenant Eve Dallas and her trusty sidekick Peabody are the main protagonists in this series, set around 2059 and subsequent years. This book, the latest in the series (September 2002) brings us back to a familiar theme: computers can spread more than just information, and our growing reliance on computers can have serious downsides. The editorial reviews provide the outline of the plot, so I won't repeat all of it here. Instead, I'll mention some specific themes that you may want to watch for. For example, one aspect of the computer \\"virus\\" that spreads to humans (believe me, this is not a spoiler; it's obvious after the first few pages) is that it appears to cause humans to want to cocoon - withdraw into their apartments and communicate less with other people than ever before. Is this a natural extension of some of the tendancies toward withdrawal that we see in computer users today? Is there really such a tendency normally? Another theme is Peabody's boyfriend who works in the EDD (Electronics Detection...) - the actions in this volume force Peabody to clarify her feelings for him.<br />There is less interaction between Eve and Roarke in this one, it felt to me, and more between Eve and her fellow cops, than in previous volumes. Of course there are still a few doses of steamy sex between the two, which don't add a thing to the plot but do seem to attract a few more readers. We do get more of Summerfield the butler, who winds up caring for the injured - somewhat differently than a hospital might do it.<br />For the crossover readers from science fiction, things to watch for: far more virtual reality than we have now; better voice activation of computers; occasional space travel; urban vehicles that aren't cars; the activities of the Electronic Detection Division. Other volumes in the series do have more about space travel than this one, which only mentions it in passing.<br />For the crossover readers from romance: less sex in this volume than in many of the previous ones, but the increased realization of the seriousness of Peabody's relationship with McNab is satisfying.<br />Overall, the plot's pretty easy to guess in this one, although there are a few twists right at the end - don't think you've got it all before then! But the interaction between the characters is more important than the plot. If you haven't read any of the others, then you may find yourself disappointed in this book, because the plot is skimpy; however, if you have read the others, then you absolutely must read this one! In between? Read a couple of them but not all? I *DO* recommend reading the whole series!

And why not? They're cute, they're cuddly, they're charming. This book may be a story for children, but it emphasizes the playful nature of guinea pigs that outsiders are unaware of.<br />Many people think of small cage pets as boring - well, you'd be boring too, if you spent your whole life in a room only a little larger than you are! But give a guinea pig room to explore, and explore he will. Real guinea pigs explore rooms in trains (one piggle behind another); these two piggies illustrate this behavior excellently. Real piggies push balls around with their noses, run through PVC tubes or ferret tubes, and occasionally tease larger pets by running under their noses; John Willie and Freddy McGee again illustrate this real behavior, in an amusing way.<br />The pictures are great - they'll have you saying \\"I know a guinea pig that looks like that!\\" The text is minimal, as would be expected, but what there is, is amusing. Words are not confined to one-syllable words; the author is aware that young children may have a receptive vocabulary larger than their speaking vocabulary, and also is aware that a book should be amusing for the adult who may have to read it 80 times in a row for their child.<br />I own this book and I don't even have children; other adults who visit us and are amused by our pet guinea pigs wind up taking this book off our shelves and reading it all the way through. Sometimes, it never makes it back off the coffee table and onto the shelf, because friends keep reading it. Buy your own copy, people!	2002-07-22

I'm the owner of (or slave to, if you prefer) several species of exotic pets. I bought this book because I saw it in my vets' office, and thought it would be a good way to learn more. Indeed it is. I'm lucky, in that my vets happen to be extremely good exotics vets, but many people live in places where the only vets are cat-and-dog vets. If you own a guinea pig or rabbit, getting it treated by a cat-and-dog vet can be chancy.<br />This book will help the pet owner double-check the advice of cat-and-dog vets they've asked to try to treat their hedgehogs or ferrets. It has other uses for pet owners, as well; the chapters for each animal also contain concise summaries of dietary needs for the animals. For some species, where commercial all-in-one pellets are still hard to find, the suggestions for constructing a balanced diet out of more readily available foods will be quite useful.<br />Every pet mammal gets mites (sigh). (I will admit to being a mammal and bird person. I have no idea whether reptiles can get mites or lice of any sort.) It's nice to have a book available telling you whether ivermectin is safe for your pet, and which solution and dilution is most commonly used for that species. Seeing what medicines are used for which diseases and parasites also can give you an idea of what diseases to watch out for in your pet. Since almost all dosages are based on weight, the book also serves as a reminder that weighing your pet regularly is an important way to keep track of its health.<br />Last but not least in importance for the pet owner, this book is less expensive than many other veterinary books, so that if you only have limited resources in which to obtain more information about your pet, this book won't put as big a dent in them as, say, some of the textbooks which include photos of surgical procedures. If you want to be the best pet owner that your pet can have, and be able to comprehend the advice your vet gives you, and discuss choices with him or her in an informed manner, this book is an excellent resource.you, and discuss choices with him or her in an informed manner, this book is an excellent resource.	2002-07-22
US	53030634	R1VRIUVQNO95NP	0486407314	324886927	101 Classic Homes of the Twenties: Floor Plans and Photographs (Dover Architecture)	Books	4	27	28	N	Y	Great addition to a collection of plan books	This is a reprint of a house plan catalog from 1925; originally, it was the catalog of the Harris, McHenry & Baker Co., a lumber company. These books from Dover are exact reprints of original plan books from the turn of the century (1880-1925, roughly - this book is one of the latest years in the series). Dover adds little or no modern explanations, just presenting the catalog as it was. So when one looks to review these books, one isn't really judging the modern-day publisher, or editing, or writing. To judge the books, one has to compare each one to others of its kind, and then to decide whether the material in it is thorough and complete according to the standards of its time. Since there are several dozen of these catalogs published by Dover, we have the basis for such a comparison.<br />This particular homes catalog has several unusual elements to it which make it worth adding to a collection. For starters, almost all of the houses are illustrated with photographs, rather than drawings, so we are seeing actual, finished models of the houses.  The photographs include some things we'd be unlikely to see in a drawing or artist's rendering, for example, the photo of the Webster model shows the driveway, and the garage with carriage-house type doors behind the house. And the Kingston shows a car in the driveway - just the rear of the car, I couldn't identify the make or model, but it is neat to see a nice middle-class house with a car, something we couldn't take for granted in earlier years.<br />Some plan books have no text except the price listings and how to order; others have entire sections of articles, or extensive suggestions as to furnishings, colors to finish the house in, etc. This book falls in between those extremes as to amount of text, but what's actually written for each house, although short, is quite unusual. The company is apparently trying to push social engineering along with new homes. For example, here's the text accompanying the photo of the Van Buren model: \\"Clean men, both of hand and heart, are invariably the product of happy home unions. It is around the harmonious hearthstone where the glow of mutual interest and understanding temper the finer senses that men mould character of sterling worth. It would be a violation of a natural law if homes in The Van Buren class should produce other than men of clean purpose.\\" And here's the text for the Dumont Duplex: \\"The Dumont cannot be surpassed as a double house, and will make homes of exceptional advantages and refinements for those whose experience and education have taught them the value of good fellowship and neighborly kindness. Learning to co-operate with our fellow creatures is the secret of overcoming selfishness and all of its poisoning effects upon our better selves.\\" Well! Is that the best reason for living in multi-family housing you've ever heard?<br />This book is late enough into the century that we can take interior bathrooms for granted; the 1920's are quite modern compared to 15 years earlier. A plan book from 1912, for example, still has half the houses without indoor baths, and many not wired for electricity. On the other hand, there are not yet garages featured automatically with the houses, and the kitchen stoves still need a chimney vented to the outside. I greatly enjoy comparing books from a few years apart, to see the progress being made. Many of the houses have the \\"built-in\\" features that became popular in the teens: built-in fold-down ironing boards, breakfast nooks with built-in bench seating, laundry chutes from upstairs to downstairs, built-in bookcases next to the fireplace or between the living room and dining room.<br />There are quite a few houses that seem ahead of their time as to modern features. The Van Buren has two bathrooms upstairs, one for the master bedroom and the other for all the other bedrooms. Both bathrooms have both a bathtub and a shower stall. In fact, looking at the floor plan for the Van Buren, one could imagine living in it today fairly easily, with just the addition of a bit more kitchen counter space. The Chesterfield, likewise, is a house I'd love to live in, with not only two full bathrooms, but built-in bookcases downstairs, and built0in window seats upstairs in the bedrooms, a walk-through pantry with more built-in cabinets than most, and beautiful balconies. The Webster has a \\"radio room\\" off the dining room - presumably for the hobbyist! It also has a downstairs powder room as well as the usual upstairs bathroom. The Westhaven offers a dumbwaiter to the basement (presumably where there is storage), a separate laundry room, a downstairs washroom with both toilet and a double sink and an upstairs bathroom, as well as a sewing room, a clothes chute, an indoor refrigerator instead of an ice box that has to be near the back door, and a waste-burner disposal. (Remember, this is before we were worried about air pollution! A waste burner was very modern then!) Most of the houses still have the refrigerators situated right by the back door, still assuming the need for ice delivery, and many with slots for milk delivery as well, but there were the first few real refrigerators, as well as real washing machines, at this time, and this company appears to be forward thinking enough to have designed houses for these brand-new conveniences.<br />In summary: a must for continuity from \\"old\\" houses to \\"modern\\" and also for the unusual text which will keep you amused.could imagine living in it today fairly easily, with just the addition of a bit more kitchen counter space.

It's buried, however, under piles of unnecessary 4-letter words, and grammatical errors and word misuse that weren't picked up by the editors.<br />Meisha Merlin usually does a better job than this - if I were the copyeditor and proofreader mentioned on the copyright page, I would ask to have my name removed. The Liaden universe novels come out pretty much free of errors; why shouldn't we expect the same for a smaller book? For example, on the first-page blurb alone, we have this: \\"Enter Drewcila Qwah a ruff and tumble salvager, who drinks to much, smokes to much, and has a mouth you wouldn't kiss your mother with. Drew and her partner, a huge hair covered alien named Van Gar, have been hired by the kings emissaries to take the confused queen to meet her husband.\\" OK, if the use of \\"to\\" instead of \\"too\\" didn't bother you, the lack of commas in some places, lack of apostrophes and hyphens in others, didn't bother you, then perhaps you won't be as annoyed as I am.<br />I don't think there's a single page that has fewer than two [expletive] on it, and after a while, I got distracted by counting the number of [expletive] and [expletive] on each page, to the detriment of whatever the characters were otherwise saying. I think the obscenities are meant to convey the notion of blue-collar, working class culture, but it's an insult to blue-collar workers everywhere.<br />There are authors who know how to use vocabulary to good effect. Tanya's Huff's \\"Valor\\" series (two books so far) has the enlisted personnel using their share of four-letter words, and every bit of it sounds realistic and necessary. Rosen's doesn't.<br />There's a happy ending, of sorts, if a bit lame. As I said, there's a pretty funny short story in here. The \\"huge, hair-covered alien\\" (forgive me, I couldn't resist the impulse to add the proper punctuation) is a lovable Wookie type, who is secretly in love with our, um, heroine. The Royal Family and its courtiers contain some stereotypes, but they're amusing. There are a couple of cute references to classic stories (I think I caught one to Sturgeon's \\"Killdozer\\") So, if you're not bothered by the flaws, you'll probably enjoy this.contain some stereotypes, but they're amusing.

There are discussions of each kind of graph (or \\"chart\\") that you are likely to make, particularly if you use the spreadsheet software Excel. What types of graphs are appropriate for what types of data? When should you use a pie chart? How can you emphasize one piece of data in a chart, to make it stand out from others? This book answers these questions, and more. For algebra students learning to graph things on graph paper or on the computer, this may be interesting, or even more so for the teacher, who can use some of the funnier examples as a way to spice up the subject and keep students interested.<br />Besides discussions of the charts themselves, the author discusses how to write and display captions, how to put charts into slides, how to make an effective slide, how to change fonts and background colors to make your chart stand out, and more.<br />Reading this book will also help you to discern when other people have fooled with their charts to distort them. Local newspapers, news magazines, etc. are often guilty of playing with the scale of charts, stretching things, leaving labels off of axes, and so on - you'll be able to spot these manipulations better.<br />I teach a college freshman course in \\"Quantitative Applications Software\\" using MS Excel; I already have a lecture I usually call \\"How to lie with charts and graphs\\" and this book will help me add more details to that lecture, which teaches students that not every graph that CAN be made, SHOULD be made. With a good graph, you should always be able to start a sentence with \\"This graph shows that...\\" and complete it with some kind of comparison.<br />I have but one complaint about this book: it was clearly intended to be in a smaller format; each page of writing and illustrations takes up less than half the full-size page of the book. This could have been a trade paperback, and have cost less than it does as a larger book, without losing anything except 3\\" of empty margin all the way around. I plan to write to the publisher, telling them I really don't like that sort of inflation.

It'll never look the same again. We visited the Texas State Aquarium, in Corpus Christi- which happens to have a special exhibit of Jim Toomey's cartoons, with original drawings, used to raise awareness of marine conservation in kids. Fun for adults, too!<br />Who couldn't want marine conservation after becoming familiar with the inhabitants of Kapupu Lagoon? Sherman is a shark with, let's say, not too much in the way of brains; his mate, Megan, is much smarter - but has her weaknesses. Hawthorne is an irritable and irritating hermit crab, who wears a beer can rather than a shell. Hawthorne has a rather elaborate crab hole- Persian carpets, golf putting range - and is always dreaming up schemes to make more money. Fillmore is an endangered turtle, who can't find a mate, possibly because of the extremely bad poetry he writes. Other characters we see regularly include a polar bear who visits the Lagoon every year instead of hibernating; a computer-savvy fish who swims around with a laptop and hacks into important systems; a giant squid who always keeps his appointments; an orca formerly in a sea-entertainment complex, who can't quite cope with life in the wild; and the occasional herd of vegetarian piranha. There's also a couple of human characters once in a while- a fishing boat captain trying to catch Sherman and/or his friends, to use on the menu at his seafood restaurant; the people who run glass-bottom boat tours; and of course the hairless beach apes whom Sherman tries to lure into the water for lunch.<br />Every strip is funny; the messages about marine conservation, about cable lines under the ocean and other human incursions affecting sea life sneak in at you without detracting from the humor at all.	2002-02-28

Normally, I write long detailed reviews of vampire books. I like the genre, and I like all the previous books in this series. But this one, well... If you want to see why I like the rest of the series, you can read my reviews of all of them, starting with _Guilty Pleasures_ and going through _Obsidian Butterfly_. That would give you a comparison for how I feel about this one. Let's start by saying I'm disappointed. At best.<br />Up to now, Anita has been feisty, moral, conflicted, and busy with her regular work as well as her love life. In this book, she appears to not be doing anything with her job at all - we never even hear about it, never hear from her boss, her co-workers. While for the past 6 months, and in the whole previous book, she was studying with a witch to learn to control her powers, in this book, although she refers to her time with the witch, despite all the problems she has controlling things, she never once thinks of picking up the phone and calling her mentor. And she appears to have abandoned her entire sense of moral conflict. This book brings in a new character, the male Nimir-Raj of another were-leopard pack, with whom Anita immediately has sex. And there's mental sex, virtual sex, interspecies sex... it gets downright tiresome. You never knew sex could be this boring.<br />Even the plot elements, such as they are, are inconsistent, both with the rest of the series and with each other. At one and the same time, we have a tribe of snake men who apparently aren't weres, they are something we never knew about before, nor had anyone in the book. And then there's a pan-were, who can turn into any species - likewise, something that's never been hinted at before in the series, and is inconsistent with what we've learned about before. And then, for reasons never very clear, the snake men who aren't weres decide as a tribe to follow the pan-were - and all of them are bad guys. Sheesh. Talk about contrived.<br />What I would really like to do is believe that Hamilton wrote this book as a parody; that now that she's got it out of her system, in the next book we will go back to where _Obsidian Butterfly_ ended, and start from there as though _Narcissus in Chains_ had never occurred. From the end of _OB_ she could take a different, more logical direction for the series, one which wouldn't change the character of Anita Blake to something unrecognizable, one which wouldn't include so much gratuitous sex that it offends even regular readers who are expecting the normal sexual content of the series. I will look forward to the next book in hopes it will meet this challenge - that's my hope for the series.ve that Hamilton wrote this book as a parody; that now that she's got it out of her system, in the next book we will go back to where _Obsidian Butterfly_ ended, and start from there as though _Narcissus in Chains_ had never occurred.

US	53030634	R10SQGR0XFT6XN	042517140X	776192522	Loyalty in Death	Books	5	7	7	N	N	The "past" of this future is scary	In this volume of the \\"in Death\\" series, we learn far more about the \\"past\\" of the series - their past history, still in our future. The series is set in the 2050's; however, the events of this book flow from events thirty years in their past, in the 2020's. This gives us more of an idea of why the New York of Eve Dallas' time is the way it is.<br />If you are new to the series, you may find it helpful to read some of the previous books as well - while each book in this series can stand alone as a police procedural/thriller, it is more fun if you can also follow the background stories of the personal lives of our characters. Eve Dallas is our police lieutenant hero, of course, and her husband Roarke (just Roarke) is his rich, enigmatic self. The interaction between Eve's sidekick/aide Peabody, and fellow cop McNab, gets tenser in this book (think elevators!). Mavis, Eve's best friend, is having success with her singing career. All of these background sub-plots are one of the fun parts of the series. It's a tradition that hangs over from police procedural series started more than 40 years ago, such as Ed McBain's 87th Precinct series, and it's nice to see Robb pay homage to that great tradition.<br />The plot of this particular volume involves a terrorist group destroying New York landmarks, a theme that will perhaps resonate even more with readers now (I write this review in Jan 2002) than it did when the book was first published. It is poignantly sad to see that on the list of proposed targets is the Twin Towers - I had to shake my head and say, sorry, the terrorists didn't wait that long... The final target, and the culmination of the book, will keep you awake and reading. And who the terrorists are will make you think, about how such things carry on through the generations, and contemplate how we could go about trying to break that cycle.	2002-02-04

They discuss how Marx and Weber sidestep everything except European experience, and how consideration of multiple civilizations shows that social development is not a straight line. There are not many other sociology books I've read whose bibliographies include articles such as &quot;Hominid Use of Fire in the Lower and Middle Pleistocene.&quot; Of course, since I'm not a sociologist, there's much I don't know - perhaps there are many other such books out there. But I certainly didn't find them while collecting a shelf-full for a grad-school sociology course (required for a major in another social science). This was one of the most readable of the 30 or so books I plowed through.<br />The main concept the authors wish to convey is that history (and sociology) should not be concerned only with chronology, but also with long-term processes. Stages, or phases, have been commented on by previous sociologists, most of them having the view either that the stages showed a steady progress upward - or a steady deterioration downward. Life has either degenerated from a golden age to a machine age, or we are now the most civilized the world has ever been in all things. In both cases, the main concerns of such authors were primarily to explain conditions in the author's present world by showing how these had arisen out of previous conditions.  Such stages were a favorite of 19th-century sociologists and anthropologists. However, twentieth century authors may have gone too far in rejecting stage models; our authors here feel that both chronology and &quot;phaseology&quot; should be taken into account.  This leads the authors to &quot;processes.&quot;<br />One of the most useful concepts presented is the authors' view of the major transformations in society: from a stage where there were no societies with control over fire, agriculture, or mechanical industry, to a stage where some societies controlled some of those, to a stage where some societies control all of those areas. Then, we can place particular societies into context - if we call a particular society &quot;agrarian&quot;, is it coexisting with many other agrarian societies? Or with industrial societies? Are they on their way toward an industrial society?<br />There is then a chapter showing the relationship between agrarian societies and religion; the function of priests as determiners of when it is time to plant is illustrated by both historic and not-too-long-ago examples. This is followed by a look at how an agrarian culture leads to socially stratified societies, and to warrior classes, and how the subsequent &quot;taming&quot; of warriors is a necessary element for further social development.<br />This book is somewhat academic, but not dense with jargon. It is not extremely heavy reading, and can be understood by someone without an intensive knowledge of sociology or economics. It's helpful if the reader is at least familiar with the names of such theorists as Marx, Spencer, Weber; for someone who has been introduced to those theorists in an undergraduate sociology class, and is looking for a more modern point of view from which to start a term paper or other further study, this book is a good starting point. Its multicultural viewpoint that includes Asian and African civilizations will be a welcome change from the Eurocentrism of the older theorists, and should also appeal to the professor for whom a student might be writing such a paper. Because of its title, it might not immediately come to such a reader's attention - since history, rather than social development, is in the title, some might pass over it. That would be a mistake.ontrol over fire, agriculture, or mechanical industry, to a stage where some societies controlled some of those, to a stage where some societies control all of those areas.

OK, where else are you going to find a pattern for knitting a stuffed clownfish? I have made 5 of them so far - two for nieces, and then 3 more for people who saw me knitting the first two, and demanded their own. The clownfish pattern is straighforward, simple. And accurate - the number of stripes, the placement of the fins and the coloring of the tail - all accurate! I am currently adapting the pattern, which is easy to do since it's simple, to make a garabaldi damselfish and a couple of different butterflyfish and angelfish.<br />The book is divided into sections - jungle, north woods, ocean, australian outback. Each section includes some kind of human character: a Polynesian pearl diver in the sea section, for example, and an Australian sheep farmer in the Australian section, a Canadian Mountie in the North Woods section.<br />The variety of animals is astounding: everything from platypus to moose. I have already purchased the yarn to do the platypus, once I finally manage to make fish for everyone who wants one. There's chipmunks, beavers, cats, tigers, merino sheep, sharks, octopus, zebra...<br />The pictures are so good, people who don't even know how to knit have spent time in my armchair leafing through the book, admiring them and asking if I can teach them to knit, because these animals are so inspiring, so cute!	2001-10-26

Chapter by chapter, he takes the reader through the different kinds of test questions, how to write them, how to grade them, how to tell if your students understand what you're asking; then he provides case studies, examples, and lists of further reading.<br />The easy kinds of questions come first: selected-response, that is, questions where the test-taker picks an answer from ones provided by the teacher, such as multiple-choice, true-false, and matching. Popham explains how to write these clearly, how to reduce the confusion on the direction of true-false questions (and why it's NOT a good idea to try and &quot;trick&quot; your students by writing ambiguous or deliberately confusing answers).<br />Then the constructed-response type of questions, that is, ones where students write the answers: short-answer and essay. Again, Popham discusses how to write these clearly, how to write instructions indicating what kind of answer you expect, and, perhaps most important, especially for the novice teacher, how to grade these types of questions. He goes through the issue of &quot;rubrics&quot; - grading systems for essay questions which tell how many points will be given for different features of the answer, such as the value of the information, the spelling and grammar, the use of certain key words, etc, and how to decide what will constitute an &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;not acceptable&quot; answer in those categories.<br />One of the most extensive and informative features of the book is Popham's sidebars on how to explain to students why they have to take these kinds of tests, and, even more, how to explain tests to parents, especially standardized tests. Explaining to parents what the tests are supposed to measure, and how test results will be used, is a very big issue these days, especially in states with high-stakes testing; Popham's book will give you practice in addressing questions from parents, administrators, etc.ham's book will give you practice in addressing questions from parents, administrators, etc.	2001-10-18

But it was pretty darn good. Now mind you, I ran across it by accident, while browsing some mysteries- although I read SF, I'm not a Simmons fan there, and I've never read Simmons' vampire stuff, even though I read vampire stuff. (So many books, so little time!!) So I'm approaching this in my capacity as a mystery reader, not as a Simmons reader.<br />First off, it's got a nice sense of humor. Start with some of the chapter titles- they go in alphabetical order, e.g.:<br />A is for Hole;<br />H is for Preparation;<br />I is for Witness;<br />T is for Sympathy<br />and all the others. Then, there's a game that Lawrence and Trudy, the couple who run the insurance adjusting firm Darwin works for, play, involving car names - sort of a Car Carnelli. Winning a round has not only to do with getting a name that connects letter-wise with the previous car name, but also with the wimpiness rating of the car and the degree of unreality of the name.<br />True, some of the humor is trite- if I've seen that collection of auto accident claims once (&quot;I had been driving my car for forty years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had an accident&quot;), I've seen it a million times; but then, I happen to work for a state department of insurance so I see a lot more of that stuff than most people. There's a few really trite courtroom humor set pieces, too; what the heck, skim through 'em fast. There are a few jokes I haven't heard before, though, too.<br />A warning: if you are not a real geek, you can skip about 2-1/2 pages where Dar not only explains a particular murder-disguised-as-accident to his lady friend, but shows her all the math equations involved in calculating the impact and trajectories of the vehicle and the victim. This is more math than I wanted to read, and I started college as a math and physics major; the number of people who would prefer to see all these equations in the middle of the text rather than a couple of sentences saying &quot;He showed her the equations&quot; is probably pret-ty darn small.<br />What else do we have here? A pretty good car chase- it's hard to do a thrilling car chase in print, but this one works. The Russian mafia. The FBI. The LAPD. The NICB (that's the National Insurance Crime Bureau, for those of you who don't regularly work in insurance, and never before suspected that there could be an insurance thriller). Cops on the take. Crooked attorneys. LOTS of murders.<br />My main pickiness about the novel: several characters are just a bit too good. I mean, Dar is not only an expert accident reconstructionist who used to work for the NTSB, he just happens to have been involved in the Challenger shuttle investigation, and before that, he got a Ph.D in physics, and before that, he was a marine sniper; he plays chess by email with 11 people simultaneously; he graduated from college at 18; he's a pilot and he sailplanes and he knows classical music and architecture and guns, is an expert at camoflage, and can quote huge chunks of Marcus Aurelius - I mean come ON, Simmons, isn't this a bit much? And then there's the female interest, an attorney/government investigator - who actually understands all the math and physics that Dar spews at her, and recognizes all his quotations, and knows all about guns herself, and so on and so on. As I said, a bit much. Have to suspend disbelief that people who do what these people do for a living also have time to be so perfect at so many outside interests. Quibble, quibble, quibble.<br />All that said - it's a fast pace, a decent read, some funny, several good incidental side stories and sort of short-story mysteries contained within it. If Simmons decides to make this a series, I'll probably go ahead and order the second book, though I do wonder if he hasn't already used up most of the insurance humor in this one and is going to have to scrounge for it in the next one.dle of the text rather than a couple of sentences saying &quot;He showed her the equations&quot; is probably pret-ty darn small. <br />What else do we have here?

Some of the techniques presented are worth the 5 stars; the lack of actual forms or examples as administered is the 3 stars. There are many examples of each technique, but all are given as narrative descriptions, not as copies of the assessment form or handout.<br />One thing potential buyers should be aware of: THIS IS NOT A BOOK ABOUT GIVING TESTS. If you are looking for how to write tests, how to test your students, how to design exams, try James Popham or something similar. This is a book full of ways to survey your students to determine whether they are ready to learn, whether they are ready to absorb more information, whether they are understanding the material - but not tests.<br />Let me give you examples of the techniques I found immediately useful:<br />Technique #1: Background Knowledge Probe. This is to be given at the first class meeting, to see whether your students know what they're supposed to before they start your class. Here's how I administered it: I teach a course called &quot;Quantitative Applications Software.&quot; It's mainly about using Microsoft Excel and related spreadsheets, and it's primarily for business majors to fill their core computer requirement. I prepared a survey form which had about 20 questions in all, with three columns to check off: &quot;Know how to do this&quot; (have studies it, remember it, can calculate it), &quot;Have heard of this&quot; (the concept is familiar but I don't remember how to figure it) and &quot;Not familiar with this.&quot; The items to rate were divided into 3 categories: math knowledge (Square roots, exponents, order of operations); business concepts (compound interest, present value, mortgages, multi-state sales taxes) and Excel concepts - which is what the students would be learning, but some already know (built-in statistical functions, calculating loan payments, setting up invoicing systems, working with multiple files.) The students filled out this survey anonymously, so no one had to be embarrassed, and then after scanning the surveys, I announced that people who were unsure of the math concepts could get tutoring, people who knew all the Excel concepts might be able to test out of the course, and for everybody else, I would have an idea of how much time to spend explaining background math before introducing an Excel function.<br />Technique #25: Student-generated test questions. Students have to generate both questions and answers. This allows you to see what they think is the most important material they've studied so far, whether they've done only the homework or also studied handouts and their lecture notes, and whether they can organize their thinking. This one should be done only after you've already given the students at least one exam or a few quizzes, so that they know the length and difficulty of questions you expect.<br />On the other hand, many of the techniques are not very useful for my subject area - some are writing-intensive and don't fit in with a course that is mostly hands-on lab work; some require students to list pros and cons of something - not necessarily feasible in a course where there's a fixed minimum of material that MUST be covered, whether the students like it or not. More useful, I suspect, for classes where there are issues and current events and discussions, than for computer science basics..)

Oh, there's a human hero, of the usual tall, dark and handsome type, for love interest - but it's the hedgehog who really saves the day. He's a perfectly natural hedgehog, not an anthropomorphized animal - he just does his hedgehogly thing. As the human slave to three pet hedgehogs, I got a great kick out of him.<br />Let's see. Merlin hasn't invented quite as many things as Ayla (you may remember Ayla, from the &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; series - Ayla domesticates the horse, Ayla domesticates the dog, Ayla invents the slingshot, Ayla invents the sewing needle, Ayla invents the cotton gin - no wait, that was someone else...) but she has her share - the telephone, and, more importantly to the English forces arrayed against Napoleon, the hang glider.<br />This is the only romance novel I've ever even tried to convince a guy to read, and the guy liked it. He missed a bit, not being as familiar with all the &quot;conventions&quot; of Regency era romances as most regular readers of them are, but he still enjoyed it.<br />My tastes in romances are pretty particular- I have high standards I demand of the writing, and clumsy or poorly written books turn me off. Kinsale will never fall into that category - she, along with a precious few others - Mary Balough, Edith Layton... writes well enough that if her books weren't pre-stigmatized as romances, they'd be among our better-written novels by contemporary novelists.	2001-10-03
US	53030634	R3CYIMSRV7EUOC	0671319884	979968594	Quincey Morris, Vampire	Books	4	6	8	N	N	A Texas vampire in London, at turn of the century	In my opinion, Elrod does much better at 20th century, or very-near-it (this book is in the 1890's) than she does at older periods in history. I didn't find her series set in American Revolutionary times to be nearly as believable as her series set in 1930's Chicago. This book is is closer to the Chicago series in tone, and has the added advantage of taking off based on Stoker's Dracula. The combination is quite good.<br />Quincy Morris, the Texan in Van Helsing's party, gets killed by wolves and discovers that the vampire hunters haven't killed Dracula after all, in that order. More than that about the bones of the plot, I leave you to discover in the reading. Let me mention some of the themes, instead of plot details:<br />The growing independence of women at the turn of the century, and the painfulness of the restrictions that were still on them;<br />The comparison of newer, brasher, &quot;American&quot; manners to the stiltedness of the Old World; The disdain in which the acting profession was held during the Victorian era; The clumsiness of baggage/cargo handlers even before there were airlines.<br />Some of BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification Guide:  Major genre: thriller; is it part of a series? If so it's the first one, but Elrod has been known to tie one series to another in the course of several books. Are there other types of supernatural beings? Yes, werewolves, apparently. What powers does the vampire have? According to Dracula, there are different kinds of vampires; Quincy's kind has far fewer powers than Dracula's, but basically he has the same powers as Elrod has given in her other series, to turn invisible, slip through walls, and hypnotize people. (Drunks and the insane can't be hypnotized; this becomes important in the course of the plot!) Does the vampire drink blood? Animal blood for sustenance, small amounts of human blood during sex. Is there a lot of sex? No, this isn't one of the sort of book where everything vampires do is a metaphor for sex or carries some inuendo; in Elrod's books, sex is sex and is not a major plot element. Is the story &quot;deadly serious&quot;?

Otherwise, though, I think you'd enjoy the Inspector Pitt stories - the police are struggling with the increasing modernization of things, and trying to adopt scientific methods; medicine is beginning to be scientific as well; there are many of the same issues regarding women's independence, and the character of Charlotte Pitt is as strong as Lady Godalming.

US	53030634	R1USOMNVSMTJTS	0486273881	923645213	Classic Houses of the Twenties (Dover Architecture)	Books	5	37	37	N	N	Another great reproduction from Dover	This is a reprint of a house plan catalog from 1927. These books are  actually exact reprints of original plan books from the turn of the century (1880-1925, roughly - this book is one of the latest years in the series). Dover adds little or no modern explanations, just presenting the catalog as it was. So when one looks to review these books, one isn't really judging the modern-day publisher, or editing, or writing. The only modern element is the accuracy of reproduction- in some cases, if pages in the originals that Dover found are damaged or torn, that page is reproduced in the original with the tear, smudge, blot, or hole showing. So to judge the books, one has to compare each one to others of its kind, and then to decide whether the material in it is thorough and complete according to the standards of its time. Since there are several dozen of these catalogs published by Dover, we have the basis for such a comparison.<br />This book originally was &quot;Loizeaux's Plan Book No. 7&quot; published by the J.D.  Loizeaux Lumber Company. The book starts with photos of the Loizeaux business locations including their lumber plant and their builders' supply yard and dock.  There are several pages showing a complete example of  what blueprints one receives if one orders a plan. Then there's an article on styles of homes, which gives the modern reader a glimpse of what styles were most popular at the time.<br />The book continues with still more articles and advice, before getting to plans: a section on decorating, including what color schemes are advised for each room. One interesting feature to today's eyes is the recommendation of strong colors for walls - according to Loizeaux, white should be used only sparingly! There are illustrations of furnished rooms. Although black and white, each is accompanied by a description of its colors. Here's a nice tasteful bedroom: &quot;Walls are tinted soft peach or apricot. Casement curtains are of sunfast voile or net in ecru or caf&eacute; au lait. Valence at top of window is of violet sateen with draperies of cretonne, chintz, or printed linen. Bed cover of violet sateen, flounce of soft jade green. Shirred over-spread of thin dotted swiss. Deep blue Wilton carpet and cushion on window seat. Slipper stool and lamp shade are in soft rose taffeta.&quot; Certainly makes your current bedroom sound pale, doesn't it?<br />In the illustrations of the kitchen and bathroom, we can tell that we are moving from the turn-of-the-century to the Art Deco era, because no longer are they done in gleaming &quot;sanitary white&quot; tile; now the tiles include colors and patterns.<br />The floor plans actually start on page 17. Each page contains an illustration (sometimes, but not always, a photo), upstairs and downstairs floor plans, a listing of overall dimensions, and 2 or 3 sentences about the house. Each room on the floor plan is labelled, and the various built-ins such as a telephone nook, medicine cabinet, or bookshelf, are pointed out.<br />Partway through the book, the plans are interrupted by more articles: one on how to heat the small home - basically, an ancestor of the infomercial, really a long advertisement for a particular brand of heater that Loizeaux sells.  Likewise an article/ad for hot water heaters.  Check out the article on G-E Wiring Systems on pages 70-71; the illustrations of a couple being shown a house by an agent are funny. Perhaps one of the funniest articles is the page about the &quot;combination bath.&quot; This was supposed to be a new, modern, convenience, combining a seat, foot bath, shower, and child's bath all in one. Looking at the illustrations (including an unclothed young man in the shower- how racy!), one can see that this design is just an accident waiting to happen, which must have finally occurred to the company, too, because we certainly don't see any of these combination baths any more!<br />Little sketches here and there add to the charm of the book - a drawing of a child operating a garbage burner, of a furnished sun parlor, and so on.<br />While most of the plans are for single-family houses, there are a few for duplexes or apartment buildings. This book is also late enough into the century that we can take interior bathrooms for granted; the 1920's are quite modern compared to a 15 years earlier. Other plan books, from 1912, for example, still have half the houses without indoor baths, and many not wired for electricity. On the other hand, it's still long enough ago that there are a few houses with thatched or  wooden roofs; there are not yet garages featured automatically with the houses, and the kitchen stoves still need a chimney vented to the outside. I greatly enjoy comparing books from a few years apart, to see the progress being made.<br />In summary: the extensive number of articles/ads in the plan book make it a valuable addition to a collection, because they provide so much information about what daily life and average tastes of the time were like, not just what architectural styles were popular. Fun reading, fun to browse, and also a valuable reference for anyone who is studying old houses and neighborhoods.ing of a child operating a garbage burner, of a furnished sun parlor, and so on.<br />While most of the plans are for single-family houses, there are a few for duplexes or apartment buildings.

US	53030634	R2QQQ4KFNAVQX6	0425176789	719797593	The Squire's Tale: A Dame Frevisse Medieval Mystery	Books	5	20	22	N	Y	Love, marriage, and death, greed and all the usual suspects	This volume is the 10th in the series about Dame Frevisse, a nun in the 15th century. It's a series best read in order - there is a lot of background in each book, and the regular characters' lives develop and change; some behavior of the characters is puzzling if you don't know the background. So, if this is the first book in the series that you are coming across, through a recommendation, for example, let me recommend that you also search for the others, starting with _The Novice's Tale_.<br />The &quot;conceit&quot; of this series set in the 1430's is that our fictional heroine, Dame Frevisse, is the niece of the genuine person Geoffrey Chaucer, author of _The Canterbury Tales_ (ISBN: 0140440224). This liberty on real history allows Frazer to convey a lot of the times, and to give her heroine a connection to the rich and famous, even though Dame Frevisse is a nun in an out-of-the-way convent. Among other things, knowing that this is Chaucer's era tells us that the middle ages are over, and the Renaissance has begun; in only a few more years, the printing press will be invented. Already, more people are literate than in previous centuries, although that's still a tiny number of people, and women are somewhat more individuals in their own right, although still quite subordinate to men. Also, the format of the Canterbury Tales also gives us the format for the titles of the books in this series, with each story being named as the Tale of a particular character.<br />To me, these things make the 15th century easier to relate to than, say, the 12th Century, where Ellis Peters' Brother Cadfael series is set. Brother Cadfael's world is alien enough to ours that it is sometimes difficult to really get into the stories, the motivations of the characters, and so on, although nonetheless I love that series. But I like the Frevisse series even better, because it is slightly more accessible - I can relate better to the characters, and therefore find the plots somewhat more understandable and believable.<br />In the 12th century, Stephen and Matilda fight over who is to rule England - both of them not figures that are really familiar to us, with the average US reader's grasp of history. However, by the 15th century, a Henry of the Tudor family is king, Henry VI, and most of us have at least some acquaintance with that dynasty. Likewise, by the 15th century, the ongoing war between England and France has taken on fairly familiar contours, with names we've heard of, such as Orleans and Burgundy. So one doesn't have to expend quite as much mental effort figuring out the country, and there's more leisure to enjoy the story. This may be one reason I enjoy this series even more than the Brother Cadfael stories. (Wonder what I'm referring to? Try &quot;A Morbid Taste for Bones: The First Chronicle of Brother Cadfael&quot; by Ellis Peters, ISBN: 0446400157.)<br />At this point in the series, the nunnery is relatively stable, earning some money by copying books and by schooling a couple of girls, and with almost enough food and supplies again. The time being Lent, the nuns are not eating during daylight hours, though, and the ongoing details about what constitutes fasting are interesting. This book starts out, though, in the home of Robert Fenner, a character we first met in an earlier book. Fenner is married to a woman older than he is; he also has wardship of a young lady almost old enough to be married off herself.  Marriage in this era is about property, and arguments between Robert and his wife Blaunche over property whose ownership is disputed are at the heart of the story. Blaunche wants Katherine, the ward, to marry her son Benedict; Robert brings Katherine to stay at the convent for a while until he and his wife can cool off over the issue. I will not give away more of the plot; it's for you to discover and enjoy. I will mention a few little details that may induce you to start reading or keep reading, though: Domina Elisabeth, the (relatively) new prioress, seems to have acquired a cat. We learn a lot more about Dame Claire's herbal medicines. A couple of lawyers provide dry humor at one point, talking legal cases over the dinner table in a manner that seems entirely familiar today. Dame Frevisse finds herself telling bedtime stories to young children.<br />In the end, despite deaths and betrayal, there is a bit of happiness and true love. It's very satisfying. I won't necessarily say that this is the &quot;best one yet&quot; - I'd have trouble picking a favorite, but I do give a slight edge to those volumes in which Frevisse has run-ins with Bishop Beaufort, who is not present in this book (thankfully, to Frevisse's way of thinking...)

He gives lots of real-life stories here. Once in a while, though, it feels a little as if he's making fun of the people involved- maybe a few fewer stories, and a few more techniques, would be a more effective tool.<br />The solutions to various neighbor problems run the gamut from sneaky, underhanded tricks involving tape recorders, to assorted legal tactics. Mediation is mentioned in several cases, although not enough in my opinion. I am fortunate to live in a city with a Dispute Resolution Center where professional mediators handle all sorts of neighborhood problems and minor legal thingies; however, I guess not every town has one, so perhaps I can't take for granted that he should recommend everyone try mediation.<br />The main point of this book, though, is to read the stories of all the horrible neighbors, and be glad they're not yours. If all you have is a slightly yappy dog next door, count yourself lucky. Enjoy the tales of encroaching plants, garbage, old cars, noise, parties, sunbathers, shade-tree mechanics, and downright psychotics. Make notes about what sort of resources there are. Adler names city and state departments and agencies you may not have known existed. He provides practical advice on how to document problems, and how to poll a neighborhood to bring people together to address a problem.<br />Many of these stories can also serve as clear instructions on how NOT to get into a 20-year feud. One thing Adler does point out in a couple of places is that if you find a problem with a neighbor, but nobody else in the neighborhood agrees with you, maybe YOU are just too sensitive. It's unlikely that the people this is aimed at will realize it, sigh...	2001-07-05

Well, yes, there is a whole subgenre of murder mysteries where the murder takes place at a science fiction convention. (There are similar subgenres of murders that take place at romance writers' conventions, and at mystery writers' conventions...) The worst - and therefore funniest - stereotypes about the bad habits of science fiction geeks are brought out. The costumed wackos, the people who can't stand real life and escape into Star Trek, the dedicated gamers... the slightly lost, slightly underweight guys who sometimes forget to eat...<br />I'd say this book is tied for my favorite in the subgenre; my other top favorite is _Sci-Fi_ by William Marshall, which takes place at a science fiction convention in Hong Kong. (It's out of print, but as of this moment, there may be a used copy available...) If you read both books back to back, your stomach muscles will hurt from laughing.<br />One of the things that annoyed me about the title of the book, funny as it is, is that when the book first came out, bookstores kept classifying it under science fiction instead of mystery; luckily I read both, so I found it.<br />Other than that confusion about the title, nothing whatsoever was wrong with this book. It was funny all the way through. So what if the nasty little author who got murdered was a stereotype of nasty, demanding, little authors? He was funny!! Our hero is a bit of a stereotype of the absentminded young professor, too, but he's funny also! Only the pickiest reader would mind a little bit of stereotyping in order to move the plot along at its hysterically funny pace.<br />One of my favorite bit characters in the book was the Scottish folksinger. As he's thinking about heading home to Scotland from his American gig, he's contemplating what he's going to tell his friends when they ask what he did in America: &quot;I fed candy to the Martians.&quot; There's also a great cop, who delivers a very funny &quot;I love this job!&quot; There's not a bad line in the book.&quot; There's not a bad line in the book.	2001-06-07

They have to be well-written, too, mind you - something that has funny lines but is otherwise incoherent wouldn't get five stars from me. However, Sharyn McCrumb is anything but incoherent. Her characters have lots of witty dialogue, but also are fleshed out to be real people. (Some more thinly fleshed out than others, but still...)<br />Elizabeth is attending the Highland Games with her cousin Geoffrey because she happens to be the Maid of the Cat for Clan Chattan. The cat is an old, toothless mountain lion. There are funny moments with other animals too- keep an eye out for poultry. At the games, she meets a genuine Scot- who has a rather jaundiced view of the American version of things, but who also has an accent that Elizabeth compares to pancake syrup; she falls in love with it almost immediately, and then with the rest of the guy.<br />The person who is murdered certainly deserves it, as is often the case in McCrumb's stories. She writes really good nasty people.<br />For me, perhaps the funniest part of the book is near the end. The officer who has been working on the case also happens to be part of a Civil War recreation group- costumes, battles, etc. Elizabeth is talking to him about the next event that's going to use the grounds after the Games are finished. It's the SCA, who dress up in medieval costumes and hold jousting tournaments. About this group, &quot;those people are weird&quot; says Clan Chattan Maid of the Cat to Confederal Colonel Lightfoot MacDonald!!	2001-06-07
US	53030634	R2NQHBKDOPES14	1892065002	443799825	Plan B	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Plan B is Grade A reading	For those who have stumbled on this book title from something else entirely, you should know that this is part of a series. You would be missing a great deal if you tried to read this first, without having read _Partners in Necessity_, the reprint of the first three books in the series.<br />This series falls into several subgenres of science fiction- partly good old space opera, partly romance, partly fantasy (I'm sorry, but anything which has wizards and goddesses in it is fantasy - not science fiction).<br />Perhaps the best thing in the book is the dry sense of humor. Miri has lots of wisecracks, Val Con is a master of irony, Shan has very sarcastically expressive eyebrows, and the Clutch Turtles are themselves. The interstellar crime cartel, the Juntavas, appear at times to be &quot;the gang that couldn't shoot straight.&quot; Jeeves the robot makes an appearance with Anthora and the cat.<br />I don't think that the Yxtrang as they are developed in this book  are the extrapolation I would have expected from the portrayal of them in the previous books. They are far too human. Frankly, the Department of the Interior seems more ruthless and warlike than the Yxtrang. Nonetheless, I like the character of Nelirikk Explorer. Not sure how the heck he learned to sew, though.<br />Toward the end of the book, several random things struck me together, to start the sort of train of thought that could be somebody's thesis in English or something- not me, gods forbid, but someone: the surname of dea'Judan; the resemblance of the name Daav to David... and I started wondering, is this Moses' flight out of Egypt? Are we going to have 40 years of wandering through space? Will we be finding more &quot;lost tribes&quot;? Somebody out there can take this and run with it- start doing an extended comparison of this book to Exodus. Maybe it's not really there. But it could be fun to look for it.	2001-05-22
US	53030634	R4PSRY69FZFG1	0786011246	744167702	The Vampire Memoirs	Books	3	4	5	N	Y	not a complete waste of time, not a great one either	I'd say this falls into the category of, summer reading, or when you have nothing better to do. If you are just getting interested in vampire books, there are LOTS better.<br />The story is disjointed, to some extent. We start out in the 4th century, but not a whole lot of historical details, and questionable accuracy on what's there. If you are used to the finely done historical periods laid out in Chelsea Quinn Yarbro's books, this book is sadly lacking. We skip centuries with no particular explanation as to why our character's powers did not develop over the centuries, the way other vampires' seem to. And our villain pops up again in the 20th century, with absolutely no explanation for how our heroine managed to miss finding him, or how he didn't find her, in all that time. Nor is any plausible explanation offered for WHY he should choose the 20th century to pop up and bother her again.<br />Our vampire characters are superficial and shallow, no great depth of personality, none of them doing anything terribly interesting. They don't regard lifespans of centuries as being any opportunity to keep learning or to influence things. What is the point of being immortal if all you're going to do is be a waitress or aerobics instructer in the evenings, go to parties, and do NOTHING else? That's about what these characters do.<br />Some of BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification: - Do our vampires drink blood literally? Yes, usually human blood, doesn't seem to make much difference to them whether willing or not. - Is drinking blood intrinsically tied to sex? No, in fact there's not much sex in the book at all. - Does the vampire hold a job? Yes, but a pointless one; many of the other vampires in the book don't, and a few seem to be of the sort where being an evil creature of darkness is all they do. - Is the book serious, or is there a sense of humor? No noticeable sense of humor, either in the writing, or in the personalities of our characters.<br />In summary: if you're reading all vampire books, then this won't be the worst you've ever read, but it won't be anything worth re-reading; if you are trying to get a feel for the best the vampire genre has to offer, go elsewhere, such as Tanya Huff, P.N. Elrod, or Chelsea Quinn Yarbro.re reading all vampire books, then this won't be the worst you've ever read, but it won't be anything worth re-reading; if you are trying to get a feel for the best the vampire genre has to offer, go elsewhere, such as Tanya Huff, P.N.

Edward demanded that as reparation, the next time he needed help on a job, Anita back him up. In this volume, Edward calls in that debt. Since Anita wants to get out of town anyway - she's trying hard to avoid Richard, jean-Claude, werewolves and other werefolk in general, and emotions in general - she doesn't argue too much before flying off to assist Edward. When she gets there, she discovers that Edward not only has a life as &quot;Ted Forrester,&quot; but that he is - gasp - engaged! Anita doesn't believe in heartless killers putting family members in danger, so a large chunk of the book is Anita's efforts to pry &quot;Ted&quot; away from his personal life so as not to risk his fiancee and her two children. This doesn't work - and the two children wind up at considerable risk.<br />Besides Edward, there are two other of Edward's assistants involved in this book - unusual people, both of them. Bernardo Spotted-Horse is merely sexy and amoral; Otto/Olaf is another matter entirely, another of those characters who is meant to make us question what claim humans have to being the good guys. An ill-tempered religious-nut cop interferes with Anita's and Edward's efforts, telling her to her face that &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&quot; Anita has no particular success in pointing out to him that she's a practicing Christian. On the other hand, the staties and feds are mainly good guys, including Agent Bradford, who we've met before in other volumes.<br />Warning, spoiler! Do not read this paragraph if you don't want to know anything about the ending! OK, Obsidian Butterfly, Aztec vampire and owner of the nightclub of the same name, is NOT the villain; while we might flinch at her claims to be a goddess, she is not the murderer of the book.<br />For those wondering about the whole series, some background information. Those who already know that they like vampire novels, anything at all that features a vampire, can skip this review, and likewise, those who hate the whole idea of vampires can skip it. But for those trying to decide whether or not to read more of this genre, or whether the one vampire novel you've already read was a fluke, it may help to have some ways to categorize these novels. Thus: BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification Guide. First, most authors of vampire novels approach from one of the main genres of genre fiction; thus their background may be primarily in romance, or in science fiction/fantasy, or in murder mysteries, or in horror. Second, many vampire novels come in series; knowing whether this is one of a series, and where in the series it falls, may be helpful. Then we have some particular characteristics: Are there continuing characters besides the vampire, through the series? - Are there other types of supernatural beings? - Does the vampire have a few other supernatural characteristics, many other supernatural characteristics, or none other than just being a vampire? (E.g., super strength, change into an animal, turn invisible) - Does the vampire have a regular job and place in society, or is being a vampire his or her entire raison d'etre? - Does the vampire literally drink blood, or is there some other (perhaps metaphorical) method of feeding? - Is sex a major plot element, a minor plot element, or nonexistent? - Does the story have elements of humor, or is it strictly serious? - Is the writing style good, or is the writing just there to manage to hold together the plot and characters?<br />This particular series is best read in order. If you read one out of order first, you'll want to go back and start from the beginning - the first volume is _Guilty Pleasures_. There's a large cast of continuing characters - Anita Blake, who is NOT a vampire, she's a zombie animator and vampire executioner. The other characters in the series include the police on the RegionalPreternatural Investigation Team, who are reasonably good guys - although the series also finds plenty of incompetent and/or corrupt cops along the way. Most of the vampire characters are involved in the entertainment biz - owning, working in, nightclubs. St. Louis in this universe has a very kinky nightclub district! The vampires have not only super strength and speed, but the power to cloud men's minds, and other powers that pop up unexpectedly and that differ from vampire to vampire. We have plenty of other supernatural characters: werewolves, wereleopards, wererats, and for all I know, werewombats; witches and voodoo priestesses, ghouls and zombies and ghosts. In other words, magic of all kinds. And most of them are Not Very Nice. Anita deals with them through a combination of violence and wisecracks; there is a strong dose of sarcasm and irony that runs through the books, and while the plots are serious, violent, and bloody, there are also funny moments; the characters have senses of humor, even some of the vampires!Preternatural Investigation Team, who are reasonably good guys - although the series also finds plenty of incompetent and/or corrupt cops along the way.

That's right, one of the occasionally furry. In doing so, she gets to meet lots of other werewolves, and werethings of other sorts. The Lunatic Caf&eacute; is a bar patronized by the weres.<br />Some of the villains in this volume are pretty conventional ones: stupid and/or corrupt cops. And others are stranger - a werewolf who's making interspecies porno snuff films, for example.<br />And then there's Edward, who is a human, and at least nominally on Anita's side, but whose personality is such that we wonder whether human is necessarily an improvement over monster. But then, that's one of the themes that emerges throughout the series: is there really much of a clearcut line between humans and others, and is being on the human side of that line necessarily an improvement? We think about this a lot when we read about the behavior of the werewolf pack. Because real wolf packs don't get into nearly that much violence, ritual fighting, etc. - it's the human part of the were that make them act unpredictable, evil, argumentative, and violent, not the wolf part. This book is the first one in the series that makes us really face that problem - up till now, it's been fairly clear who the bad guys are and who the good guys are. But when the werewolves talk about &quot;giving in to their beast&quot; it's usually an excuse to do some fighting or violence only a human would think of.<br />I won't give away all of the ending, except to tell you that there's an unexpected villain and it's not one of the fierce, savage predators, either. Human pride is what motivates that villain.<br />For those wondering about the whole series, some background information. Those who already know that they like vampire novels, anything at all that features a vampire, can skip this review, and likewise, those who hate the whole idea of vampires can skip it. But for those trying to decide whether or not to read more of this genre, or whether the one vampire novel you've already read was a fluke, it may help to have some ways to categorize these novels. Thus: BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification Guide. First, most authors of vampire novels approach from one of the main genres of genre fiction; thus their background may be primarily in romance, or in science fiction/fantasy, or in murder mysteries, or in horror. Second, many vampire novels come in series; knowing whether this is one of a series, and where in the series it falls, may be helpful. Then we have some particular characteristics: Are there continuing characters besides the vampire, through the series? - Are there other types of supernatural beings? - Does the vampire have a few other supernatural characteristics, many other supernatural characteristics, or none other than just being a vampire? (E.g., super strength, change into an animal, turn invisible) - Does the vampire have a regular job and place in society, or is being a vampire his or her entire raison d'etre? - Does the vampire literally drink blood, or is there some other (perhaps metaphorical) method of feeding? - Is sex a major plot element, a minor plot element, or nonexistent? - Does the story have elements of humor, or is it strictly serious? - Is the writing style good, or is the writing just there to manage to hold together the plot and characters?<br />This particular book is the fourth in a series, and it's a series best read in order. If you read one out of order first, you'll want to go back and start from the beginning - the first volume is _Guilty Pleasures_. The series comes from the hard-boiled detective/thriller genres. There's a large cast of continuing characters - Anita Blake, who is NOT a vampire, she's a zombie animator and vampire executioner. The setting is St. Louis, but the specific city isn't integral to the plot the way being in Toronto is a very specific plot element in Huff's books, or Chicago in Elrod's. The other characters include the police on the Regional Preternatural Investigation Team, who are reasonably good guys - although the series also finds plenty of incompetent and/or corrupt cops along the way. Most of the vampire characters are involved in the entertainment biz - owning, working in, nightclubs. St. Louis in this universe has a very kinky nightclub district! The vampires have not only super strength and speed, but the power to cloud men's minds, and other powers that pop up unexpectedly and that differ from vampire to vampire. We have plenty of other supernatural characters: werewolves, wereleopards, wererats, and for all I know, werewombats; witches and voodoo priestesses, ghouls and zombies and ghosts. In other words, magic of all kinds. And most of them are Not Very Nice.

What we and Anita know, and what she doesn't want to let anyone else know, is that it is also the daytime resting place of Jean-Claude. By the way, when we get to _Killing Dance_ later in the series, Anita will spend some very important time in the basement of the Circus, herself.<br />In this episode, we have one of the most interesting bad guys in the series, Mr. Oliver, the oldest vampire Anita will ever meet. How old is he? Hint: sloping forehead and chin, prominent brow ridge, short... yeah, homo erectus, not homo sapiens. However, just one enemy at a time would be boring for Anita. There's also another master vampire after her, one who would seem old if Mr. O wasn't around- he's an Aztec. And there's a rabid new offshoot of Humans Against Vampires, called Humans First. Oh, and a lamia - giant snake-woman. Well, aren't giant half-snake, half-women the sort of thing you expect at a circus?<br />But the most important thing in the book is Richard. Richard is a very nice junior high school teacher who just happens to be a werewolf. And yes, Anita will be dating the occasionally furry Richard, though at the end of the book she's still refusing to date Jean-Claude. Furry is one thing, dead is another. Or, as she says, &quot;Most women complain that there are no single, straight men left. I'd just like to meet one who's human.&quot;<br />For those wondering about the whole series, you can find out more about the characteristics of vampire novels in general and how this series fills some of those characteristics, by reading my reviews of earlier books in the series, such as _Guilty Pleasures_.	2001-04-12

He refuses it - Edward is strange, but probably Anita is as close to a friend as he gets, and Edward is as close to a human friend as Anita gets apart from her PI pal Ronnie.<br />While hiding out from various hitmen, hitwomen, and hitbeings, Anita stays at Richard's house-  that's her werewolf boyfriend - and then in the basement of the Circus of the Damned, daytime resting place of her vampire boyfriend, Jean-Claude, Master of the City. Yes, sleeping in the houses of two different boyfriends, two nights in a row, does lead to excessive complications.<br />Apart from that, we get introduced to more infighting in the werewolf pack, a vampire who tried to give up drinking blood, and a new witch on Dolph Storr's police team. Jean-Claude opens a new nightclub, Danse Macabre. For best effect, while you're reading, listen to Camille Saint-Saens' &quot;Danse Macabre&quot; on the stereo, and when that runs out, listen to Hector Berlioz' &quot;Symphonie Fantastique.&quot; The latter features the Deis Irae theme, used in the mass for the dead, very good music to read vampires by.

Villians from the world we know! However, fear not, there are also the sorts of villians we look for Anita to be dealing with: Magnus Bouvier, who owns the bar &amp; grill called &quot;Bloody Bones,&quot; is a fairy who is not as nice as we might hope - or, as Anita puts it, &quot;f - - ing unseelie court!&quot; We also meet some other new types of characters - a nursery boggle, that is, the kind of monster used to threaten children with, the old &quot;if you don't behave, the monster will come get you!&quot; type of monster. And a vampire who uses a sword- I have to admit, I didn't quite see the point of that, pardon the pun. It is never clear to me why we would have the swords involved.<br />Much of the action involves Jean-Claude coming down to Branson to help Anita meet the master of the Branson area. He brings Jason the werewolf with him, and Anita has young Larry Kirkland, the animator-in-training, with her, so we get two sidekicks for our leads to deal with.<br />There's a mass zombie raising, and there's a satisfactory come-uppance for the nasty real estate developer, and there's a  gruesome vampire-burning-to-death-in-sunlight if that's your thing... along with the swords, there's even more than the usual amount of violence for the series.<br />For those wondering about the whole series, some background information.

(_Guilty Pleasures_ is the first book in the series, for those who want to start from the beginning.) The &quot;hero&quot; or main character of the story is not a vampire, it's Anita Blake, zombie reanimator and occasional vampire executioner.  However, Jean-Claude, the vampire who in the course of the series becomes the Master vampire of the city, also eventually becomes Anita's lover, and is, we might say, the assistant lead character. The continuing characters include the various vampires living in St. Louis, a few police detectives and officers whom we see regularly, and Anita's neighbors. There are other supernatural characters, lots of them - zombies, ghouls, werewolves, wereleopards, wererats; for all I know, were-wombats may show up sometime.  Jean-Claude and the other vampires have the usual super-strength and super-speed; in addition, they have the traditional &quot;power to cloud men's minds.&quot; The master vampires occasionally turn out to have other, unexpected, powers. Many of the vampires work for or in nightclubs; the city of St. Louis in this universe seems to have a really kinky nightclub district! The vampires do drink blood, human, and by no means necessarily from consenting adults. The drinking of blood doesn't have to be associated with sex, but sometimes is. There are a lot of sexual undertones, overtones, innuendo, and atmosphere in the books, and after the first couple in the series, the rest have a generous amount of explicit sex. And some of it is inter-species, sort of. This series is not for the prude! Hamilton's characters have a nice sense of irony and sarcasm, and both Anita's thoughts to herself and the dialog can be quite funny, but the stories andplots themselves are quite serious. No cutesy fantasy or playing it for puns here<br />In this book, we meet a voodoo priestess; vaudun is one of the many supernatural things that works in this version of St. Louis. In fact, the weather seems to resemble the real St. Louis, but other than that, I'm not sure you would recognize St. Louis from these books, the way you would recognize, say, Toronto, if you visited there after reading Tanya Huff's books, or Chicago after reading Elrod's series set in 1930's Chicago. This St. Louis seems to be populated mostly by supernatural characters, and most of the businesses seem to be bars or nightclubs. _The Laughing Corpse_ has a millionaire who wants to raise an ancestor to find out where he buried the treasure; an animator who isn't (I leave that for you to discover); murdered families, including some fairly grisly scenes (at which both Anita and various cops throw up); and some bodyguard/thugs who are played for farce - Anita manages to seriously damage them. Anita does get hurt, frequently - throughout the series, she seems to spend as much time getting things patched, then leaving the hospital before the doctor says it's OK, as the jockeys in a Dick Francis novel do.

These books are actually exact reprints of original plan books from the turn of the century (1880-1925, roughly). Dover adds little or no modern explanations, just presenting the catalog as it was. So when one looks to review these books, one isn't really judging the modern-day publisher, or editing, or writing. The only modern element is the accuracy of reproduction- in some cases, if pages in the originals that Dover found are damaged or torn, that page is reproduced in the original with the tear, smudge, blot, or hole showing. So to judge the books, one has to compare each one to others of its kind, and then to decide whether the material in it is thorough and complete according to the standards of its time. Since there are several dozen of these catalogs published by Dover, we have the basis for such a comparison.<br />Stickley and the Craftsman school of design are well known. Many people own bungalows, or admire them even if they don't own them. What getting a book such as this does, is give a person insight into the details of the lifestyle of the time, of the philosophy of the architects/designers, and so on.<br />This particular plan book is one of my favorites. It includes an introductory essay by Stickley, an essay on &quot;The Relation of Craftsman Architecture to Country Living,&quot; and several other pieces. &quot;The House of the Democrat&quot; by William L. Price is also included, a thoughtful essay which would give anyone pause when looking at today's McMansions. Price says that a house should not embarrass one's friends; it should be ample enough to contain them, simple enough to leave them unoppressed, and with enough artistry to please and lead them, if they wish, to build one likewise. This essay is worth the price of the book!<br />One of the features of this catalog is that along with the exterior view and floor plan of every house, there is an extensive written description. For many of the houses there are drawings of the interior, with suggestions for furnishings. There are also examples of what types of light fixtures one might use. There are several cement houses, a fad of the time which should have caught on more than it did, as it is an economical and sturdy material for building a house. The written descriptions, in some cases, even include alternate ways to finish the house to save money or to adapt it to a particular type of location. Most of the illustrations are drawings/paintings; there are a few photographs, but not many.  The drawings of the interiors include wallpapers and curtains.<br />There are a few houses in the book without indoor bathrooms, which is not unusual for the period, but most have a full bath, and some have two bathrooms. Almost all have extensive built-ins: sideboards, bookcases, benches and settles, shelves.<br />There are a few plans for log houses, for summer camp houses, and even for rural schoolhouses. There's also a section on gardening and landscaping; one on pergolas, one on the details of concrete house construction, and one on how fireplaces work for heating and ventilation.<br />In sum: this is more than just a plan book; the only bad point is that if this is your first exposure to plan books, then the subsequent ones you read will seem plain and lacking by comparison.

These books are actually exact reprints of original plan books from the turn of the century (1880-1925, roughly). Dover adds little or no modern explanations, just presenting the catalog as it was. So when one looks to review these books, one isn't really judging the modern-day publisher, or editing, or writing. The only modern element is the accuracy of reproduction- in some cases, if pages in the originals that Dover found are damaged or torn, that page is reproduced in the original with the tear, smudge, blot, or hole showing. So to judge the books, one has to compare each one to others of its kind, and then to decide whether the material in it is thorough and complete according to the standards of its time. Since there are several dozen of these catalogs published by Dover, we have the basis for such a comparison.<br />Stickley and the Craftsman school of design are well known. Many people own bungalows, or admire them even if they don't own them. What getting a book such as this does, is give a person insight into the details of the lifestyle of the time, of the philosophy of the architects/designers, and so on.<br />This particular book is one of my favorites. As with other Stickley catalogs, it includes several essays. The first one is &quot;The Simplification of Life: A Chapter from Edward Carpenter's book called 'England's Ideal'&quot;. This essay resonates today, with people who are looking to get away from some of the modern excesses of possessions and displays of wealth, to a simpler life. There is also a review of another book, with quotes from it: &quot;The Art of Building a Home&quot; by Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin.<br />One of the features of this catalog is that along with the exterior view and floor plan of every house, there is an extensive written description. For many of the houses there are drawings of the interior, with suggestions for furnishings. There are also examples of what types of light fixtures one might use. The written descriptions, in some cases, even include alternate ways to finish the house to save money or to adapt it to a particular type of location. Most of the illustrations are drawings/paintings; there are a few photographs, but not many.  The drawings of the interiors include wallpapers and curtains. One illustration even shows a Craftsman piano! There are some concrete/cement houses, including ones mixing concrete with wood construction.<br />There are a few houses in the book without indoor bathrooms, which is not unusual for the period, but most have a full bath, and some have two bathrooms. Almost all have extensive built-ins: sideboards, bookcases, benches and settles, shelves. There are illustrations of the kitchens; while built-in kitchen cabinets as we know them now were not common at the time, these illustrations show kitchens furnished with the cabinets and tables that were common, and show the placement of stoves, water heaters, etc. There are also some wonderful examples of inlaid decorative wood flooring, and large sections on Craftsman furniture, metal work, and fabrics and needlework.<br />One of my favorite things in the whole book is &quot;Two Inexpensive but Charming Cottages for Women Who Want Their Own Homes.&quot; It's difficult for us to imagine now, how radical an idea that was - that women might want to own their own homes without necessarily getting married. Recognizing that even if she works, a woman's income at that time would be significantly less than a man's, Stickley designs these homes to be economically built. He describes how two or three single women might manage to share such a home, making it more affordable. Very forward-thinking for the time!<br />In sum: this is more than just a plan book; the only bad point is that if this is your first exposure to plan books, then the subsequent ones you read will seem plain and lacking by comparison.

These books are actually exact reprints of original plan books from the turn of the century (1880-1925, roughly). Dover adds little or no modern explanations, just presenting the catalog as it was. So when one looks to review these books, one isn't really judging the modern-day publisher, or editing, or writing. The only modern element is the accuracy of reproduction- in some cases, if pages in the originals that Dover found are damaged or torn, that page is reproduced in the original with the tear, smudge, blot, or hole showing. So to judge the books, one has to compare each one to others of its kind, and then to decide whether the material in it is thorough and complete according to the standards of its time. Since there are several dozen of these catalogs published by Dover, we have the basis for such a comparison.<br />So how does this one shape up compared to, say &quot;California Bungalows of the Twenties&quot; or &quot;Craftsman Bungalows&quot;? Well, there's very little text. Other than an introduction (from the original catalog maker), there is no descriptive text accompanying each house plan. In fact, the same boilerplate paragraph about what the blueprints and specifications include is the only text on each page, other than the house dimensions and the price of the plans. Then, there's no suggestions for furnishing, for colors to paint the house, or for what kind of lot or location the house might be best suited for. Many other catalogs include this kind of description. The illustrations of each house are elaborate drawings/paintings, presented at an angle view. Some catalogs present many of their houses face-on, which means you can't visualize what the sides really look like; the views in this catalog give you an idea of the front and at least one side in every case. There are no photos, and no illustrations of any of the interior of the house, nor of any of the specific styles of built-ins available. Some catalogs show a typical bathroom, a typical living room, etc., and have a few pages showing the styles of kitchen cabinets available; this one doesn't.<br /> On the other hand, this catalog includes a wider variety of architectural styles than the title might suggest, and some of the most interesting exteriors I've seen. Our own house, built in 1919, has curved eaves on the gables meeting curved eaves on the main roof, and we've always wondered whether the architect was on drugs. Now we know that he may have gotten his inspiration from Radford; several of the houses in this book have curved eaves meeting each other. Haven't seen that in other catalogs. The book has a wide definition of what's a bungalow, so there are houses with gambrel roofs, 3-room cottages, and 9-room expensive houses with servants' quarters. One interesting thing about the Radford plans is that, although published in 1908, virtually all of the houses have indoor bathrooms - only 2 plans in the whole book, that I recall, don't have an indoor bathroom. In 1908, that's unusual -  many other contemporary plan books have as much as a quarter to a third of their models without a complete indoor bathroom or even an indoor toilet. Not only that, many of Radford's houses have both an upstairs full bath and a downstairs half-bath (toilet and sink) - almost unheard of at the time! So the architects were apparently fairly forward-thinking. A few houses even have two full baths, a feature that otherwise wouldn't become common until 40 years later.<br />The floor plans are, for the most part, large enough to be clearly readable, and there are only a couple of cases where the architects have left off the dimensions of a room. Ceiling beams, pull-out beds, built-in seats and benches and shelves, are all indicated on the floor plans.<br />In sum: good variety of exteriors and floor plans, some advanced features for the time; poor in its lack of interior illustrations or actual photos of completed houses. This shouldn't be your only plan book - there are others with lots more detail if you are just getting acquainted with the genre - but if you are collecting several such books, then this one is a nice addition to the variety in your collection.trations or actual photos of completed houses.

Since there are several dozen of these catalogs published by Dover, we have the basis for such a comparison.<br />&quot;California Bungalows&quot; was originally titles &quot;Wilson's California Bungalow.&quot; The book starts with a description of what all stock plans include, how much it costs to get duplicates, etc. There's not much about the philosophy of the architect, as in some books. (For example, Radford's Artistic Bungalows says quite a lot about how they went to great lengths to hire architects experienced in the design of small-and-medium sized houses, and about how costs can or cannot be estimated in advance, and so on. This book doesn't have that.) On the other hand, with each individual house, there is description of some of the features of the house, ones that wouldn't necessarily be visible right away, such as that a mantel is made of brick, or the dining room built-in buffet has glass doors and a plate mirror. That's a nice touch. Each description has an estimate of what it would cost to build the house.<br />The illustrations of each house vary widely - some are photos of finished houses, some are detailed drawings/paintings, and some are just sketches/line drawings. So one doesn't get the same level of information about the appearance of every house. Some of the illustrations are face-on, meaning we see only the front of the house, and can only imagine the sides from the floor plans. On the other hand, for many of the houses, a second illustration is included, of at least one room of the interior. Fully-furnished living rooms are shown; or an illustration of a &quot;typical bathroom&quot; showing what types of fixtures are expected; there's a full-page illustration of &quot;Wilson's Buffet Kitchen&quot; with cut-away view of the cabinets, and complete with a maid in an apron working at the stove. There are several pages showing what styles of dining room buffets, or sideboards, are available, and a section showing doors and locksets you can actually order.<br />Almost all the floor plans are large and readable, although a few are quite cluttered; with every closet described as broom closet or linen closet, the lettering outstretches the space available. There's also a disconcerting habit, at least to my modern eyes, of referring to the inside chimney as a &quot;thimble&quot; - maybe that was a contemporary usage, but I can't recall seeing it in any other catalog.<br />In sum: good plans, lots of details on interiors, good ideas on how such houses were furnished; poorer aspect is that some houses are presented only with a sketch.

His hero is usually taken for granted and under-appreciated by his family, and under-employed, but in the course of the book proves he is far smarter, cleverer, and more observant than anyone supposed. Usually, there's a highly intelligent middle-aged career woman who recognizes his worth and helps him along. It's a formula, but the details that Francis provides makes it work every time.<br />In this book, our hero is an architect and builder. We find him almost finished with his latest restoration project - he and his family move into a place, restore it, sell it, and move on. This time, however, the family wants to stay put. Even though only in his 30's, our hero has six sons, and wonderful kids they are, too. Perhaps a little too good to be true, but hey, this *is* fiction.<br />Lee and his sons are travelling around in a large motor home, one converted from a more utilitarian large vehicle. We find that the motor home is made efficient by building it using yacht-building techniques, so that the most possible stuff can be put in the least space. Francis has used yacht-building in some of his other books (for example, Risk), and it was interesting to see the same thing here.<br />Apart from Lee's wife, who doesn't really appreciate him, we also have Lee's family on his mother's side, from which he has been estranged, and most of whom outright hate him. Of course, by the end of the book, he has won respect from a few of them. The matriarch of that clan is a cunning old lady, with a whim of iron; her assorted offspring and their offspring are a wide bunch of eccentrics, and the descriptions of them will remind one of why the British aristocracy has such a reputation for eccentricity.<br />The youngest son accompanying Lee is a smart kid, and listening to him point out common sense, or bits of chemical or physics trivia, to adults who know nothing but horses, is amusing. Maybe a little too good to be true, but Francis nonetheless makes him seem like a real little boy, so we can almost wish that real little boys were like this!l or physics trivia, to adults who know nothing but horses, is amusing.

I like a lot of Francis's books, but this one had that something extra for me.<br />Dick Francis has a winning formula: he writes books about a young man of around 30, in a career most people might think is boring, but which turns out to be exciting. His hero is usually taken for granted and under-appreciated by his family, and under-employed, but in the course of the book proves he is far smarter, cleverer, and more observant than anyone supposed. Usually, there's a highly intelligent middle-aged career woman who recognizes his worth and helps him along. It's a formula, but the details that Francis provides makes it work every time.<br />Our heros in this book include not only Freddie Croft, who owns the horse transport business, but a veterinary epidemiology researcher who is quite a character. We learn more, perhaps, about viruses, parasite-born diseases, and other related things than some people might want to know; if you're squeamish, you might not want all the details of some of the illnesses we hear about along the way.<br />The stock middle-aged woman character this time is a rather unusual woman truck driver; Francis has always been in the forefront of having women in interesting careers; even back in the 60's, many of the women in his books held jobs. One doesn't tend to think of mystery writers/racing writers as being on the leading edge of trends, but Francis has shown himself to be so, in having career women, gays, and the disabled as important and strong characters in his books, even in the midst of the old-fashioned and conservative racing world.	2001-03-15

Dick Francis has a formula that almost all of his books follow, but the details that Francis provides makes it work every time.<br />In this case, our hero is a jockey. Now, many people may be like me- they never got around to reading Dick Francis because they thought all the books are just about jockeys and horseracing. Well, as it turns out, most of the books written in the past 25 years DON'T have jockeys as their primary characters. So I wound up reading some of those, and then just had to read more Francis. And I came to this one, in which the hero IS a jockey - and I liked it anyway!<br />Our hero is a jockey and amateur photographer who has led a rather rootless life. Left by his mother with a series of friends all through his childhood, he has no close attachments, and in the course of the book must finally learn to acknowledge emotions and grow close to people. The middle-aged woman in this one is one of the women who took care of him when he was young; he spends part of the book trying to find places from his childhood. There's also the stock character of the cunning, wily, whim-of-iron old lady, who thinks the world is motivated solely by greed, and a few other stock types. There are also some unusual bits- although this book was written in the 80's, before the current trend toward acceptance of homosexuality, Francis has included in our hero's checkered childhood a loving gay couple who give him the most stable part of his upbringing. Our hero is himself quite straight, and falls in love with the middle-aged woman's daughter.<br />The details about photography are fascinating- maybe more than some people might want, and some of it so obscure you have to suspend disbelief a little to think that an amateur might figure out what was going on. But of course, that's part of our hero's hitherto unrevealed cleverness. Some of the photos have been part of what turns out to be one of the oddest blackmail schemes ever. We also get an unusual scheme for sulphide gas poisoning, one of the odder methods for potential murder... and some arson, assault, and other violence. It's not overdone, though.<br />If you're afraid of reading about jockeys and racing because you're not interested in those subjects, then this book will cure you of that fear.s poisoning, one of the odder methods for potential murder... and some arson, assault, and other violence.

His hero is usually taken for granted and under-appreciated by his family, and under-employed, but in the course of the book proves he is far smarter, cleverer, and more observant than anyone supposed. Usually, there's a highly intelligent middle-aged career woman who recognizes his worth and helps him along. It's a formula, but the details that Francis provides makes it work every time.<br />In this case, our hero is an accountant, an auditor. Many people would start to snore at the thought that auditing could be an exciting job; as a former auditor myself, who has since traded it in for the relative calm of a desk job, I was pleased to see him show how varied and interesting the job can be. Auditors have to know a great deal about a variety of industries, do a lot of travelling, and have highly analytical minds used to investigating small details and discrepancies that most people would not notice. (There might be a bit of bias on my part, of course.) All this means that an auditor winds up making a good investigator of mysteries, as well.<br />Along with the details of Roland's regular job, and the details of horse-racing that are in every book, we also happen to find out a great deal about yacht-building. Such details are all through Francis's books; he seems to know about every possible job, and must collect details as much as most people collect lint. I always enjoy learning these details!<br />In this particular book, we have some ambiguous people who turn out not to be bad guys, the person captaining the yacht that Roland first is stored on when kidnapped. Then, the bad guy turns out to be a total surprise, someone we don't suspect at all till the end is revealed. Nonetheless, once the details are pointed out, one goes &quot;Of course!&quot;	2001-03-15

Along the way, have his family, who doesn't appreciate him and takes him for granted, find out that he is more important to them than they to him. And an intelligent, middle-aged woman who recognizes his value and will help him in his future career. Stated in a formula like this, it doesn't sound like that much, but the details Francis gives in each book make it fascinating.<br />Some people might hesitate to read a Francis book, as I did for years- I thought they were just about horse racing and jockeys, and as that wasn't a particular interest of mine, I didn't bother. However, in most of his books written in the last 25 years, although horse-racing is always a part of the plot, the main characters are in all walks and fields of life, and one does not have to love horses and jockeys to read these books.<br />In this case, our hero's career is investment banking. Some people would start to doze off at the thought of banking, but Francis provides us with details of the job that show the exciting parts of it, the skills required, and the variety that can enter into it.<br />When the banking firm finds itself asked to invest in a race horse, Tim Ekaterin, the poor relation of the family, turns out to have the knowledge needed for this risk. He also knows enough to recognize that when something goes wrong, it may not be due to natural causes. We meet veterinarians, chemists, and other researchers, all of whose work is described accurately enough to make one suspect that Francis has a friend or relative in every field mentioned and has pried every detail of their daily lives out of them.<br />The ending is good; the bad guys get their come-uppance, and greed is punished, while our hero is finally rewarded with some recognition in both his personal and work lives.both his personal and work lives.	2001-03-15

Francis has a winning formula: he writes books about a young man of around 30, in a career most people might think is boring, but which turns out to be exciting. His hero is usually taken for granted and under-appreciated by his family, and under-employed, but in the course of the book proves he is far smarter, cleverer, and more observant than anyone supposed.<br />Usually, there's a highly intelligent middle-aged career woman who recognizes his worth and helps him along. It's a formula, but the details that Francis provides makes it work every time.<br />In this second book about Sid Halley, Sid has gotten the artificial hand replacement that was talked about at the end of the previous book, Odds Against. As ever, Francis has done his research, and we find out a great deal about the science and engineering that goes into a working mechanical hand.<br />The biggest part of this story is not the mystery, although of course that's there, but the story of Sid coming to terms with his own courage in the face of what he fears is cowardice. One of our villians threatens to destroy Sid's remaining hand, and Sid is at first afraid that he is going to give in to that threat. But living with himself after giving in to such threats would be a problem; Sid almost accidentally decides to stand up and against evil instead, and wins out in the end.	2001-03-15

A few characters are fully fleshed out (as it were) but many are sketchy, and many are killed off before we get to know them. The motives can be confusing.

Introducing umpteen different subspecies of elves was an unnecessary complication. -Is it deadly serious (pardon the pun)? Nope, I believe I've addressed that.

Learn why piggies love parsley, how baby guinea pigs are different from most babies, and why two guinea pigs are better than one.<br />My only quibble would be that the book could have used a little bit more editing; sometimes the sentence structure is a little *too* much like talking, which can be confusing in print, without voice inflections and pauses. One would like a book that will be a permanent part of one's library to have been edited for grammar and punctuation. But that's a small quibble to a delightful book.	2001-02-02

Those who already know that they like vampire novels, anything at all that features a vampire, can skip this review, and likewise, those who hate the whole idea of vampires can skip it. But for those trying to decide whether or not to read more of this genre, or whether the one vampire novel you've already read was a fluke, it may help to have some ways to categorize these novels. Thus: BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification Guide. First, most authors of vampire novels approach from one of the main genres of genre fiction; thus their background may be primarily in romance, or in science fiction/fantasy, or in murder mysteries, or in horror. Second, many vampire novels come in series; knowing whether this is one of a series, and where in the series it falls, may be helpful. Then we have some particular characteristics: - Is the vampire character (or characters) a &quot;good guy&quot; or a &quot;bad guy&quot;? Or are there some of each? - Are there continuing characters besides the vampire, through the series? - Are there other types of supernatural beings besides vampires? - Can the vampire stand daylight under some circumstances, or not stand daylight at all? - Does the vampire have a few other supernatural characteristics, many other supernatural characteristics, or none other than just being a vampire? (E.g., super strength, change into an animal, turn invisible) - Does the vampire have a regular job and place in society, or is being a vampire his or her entire raison d'etre? - Does the vampire literally drink blood, or is there some other (perhaps metaphorical) method of feeding? - Is sex a major plot element, a minor plot element, or nonexistent? - Is the entire vampire feeding act a metaphor for sex, part of a standard sex act, or unrelated to sex? - Is the story set in one historical period, more than one historical period, or entirely in the present day?  - Does the story have elements of humor, or is it strictly serious? - Is the writing style good, or is the writing just there to manage to hold together the plot and characters?<br />P.N. Elrod's series about Jack Fleming is in the hard-boiled detective genre. Fleming is a good guy (although with worries about his own ethics). Fleming is a former journalist (before he died), now working as a sidekick to a private investigator. The series takes place in the Chicago of the '30s, after Al Capone is locked up, but before the Depression ends. Criminal gangs are still a big force in Chicago. Besides Jack and his boss, various criminal mobs, and police both honest and corrupt, are recurring characters in the series. So is Jack's girlfriend, Bobbi, a nightclub singer. Jack drinks blood, but it doesn't have to be human- he uses cows at the Stockyards usually, and likes horses as a treat. He does, however, also drink a little from his girlfriend during sex. Sex is discreet and not too frequent in the series- no explicit details; this is a detective series, not a romance. Jack has a few supernatural powers associated with being a vampire: the usual ones of being stronger and faster than humans, and he also can turn invisible and float through walls. He must sleep during the day, on his native earth - but garlic and crosses don't bother him. There aren't any other kinds of supernatural characters in the series. As befits the detective genre, there is a certain amount of wisecracking in the dialogue; Jack can be a smart-ass sometimes, and the criminals can be inadvertently funny. Overall, the series is a well-done version of the genre, each book being easy to read and most of the characters being well-described and thought out.<br />The second book in the series gives us more information about Jack's first love, Maureen, who turned him into a vampire, and who has been missing for several years. We also learn more about Jack's own family. One caution for new readers: if you haven't read the first book in the series, goback and read it - this series pretty much has to be read in order. Unlike many series, the action in each book here is not separated by some unwritten-about period; the action in each book picks up quite soon after the previous book, often as early as the next day - or night. This book has more than one plot going on; besides the search for Maureen, and meeting with an unusual member of her family, there are also a couple of vampire-hunters after Jack. The vampire hunters are a bit two-dimensional, stereotyped characters - a simple minded young bumpkin following an older religious fanatic. Jack is disgusted with how many people seem to buy every word that Bram Stoker wrote. Hey, Jack's a nice guy, not a villain- he calls his mother regularly, sends money home to help his parents out, and does his best to live as normal a life as one of the undead can! When he kills someone in this book, he is worried, because even though the guy deserved killing, and had tried to kill Jack (ha!), Jack doesn't want to become a killer himself. His worries about the ethics of his condition are interesting to follow.go back and read it - this series pretty much has to be read in order.

In this book in the series, Jack goes searching further for Maureen, and winds up meeting Jonathan Barrett, an almost-200-year-old vampire who has landed a cushy job as a private secretary to a recluse. There are several mysteries surrounding the recluse's family and neighbors. Barrett (who appears as the star in a separate Elrod series) also wants to protect himself, and although he's not evil, his ideas about his own best self-interest conflict with Jack's drive to find out more about Maureen. When we find out some of the solution to the mysteries above, we get an interesting depiction of the fine line between sanity and insanity, expressed in terms before the word sociopath was is everyday vocabulary.<br />Those who already know that they like vampire novels, anything at all that features a vampire, can skip this review, and likewise, those who hate the whole idea of vampires can skip it.

Fitzroy is a good guy, just leading a quiet life. The continuing characters include several types of humans: police officers, detectives, street people, family members. There are other supernatural characters, usually only one type per book (e.g., werewolves). Henry definitely can't stand daylight at all; it literally burns him. He has extraordinary strength and speed, and a sort of hypnotic influence but no &quot;magic&quot; powers. In fact, other than the existence of a few types of supernatural beings, there is little supernatural going on in the series - it's everyday modern Toronto, not a fantasy world. He's got a day job - er, make that a night job: he's a writer. He drinks blood, usually from consenting adults, sometimes associated with sex, but not necessarily. There is sex in the books, but it's a minor plot element, not graphically detailed. These stories are there for the mystery/thriller elements; romance is only a sideline. Huff allows the characters to have a sense of humor: witty dialogue, a way with words. Some of the characters are set up for humor and farce as well, although not in a crude or gross way. The writing is well above average for &quot;genre fiction&quot; and the books are quite enjoyable to read.<br />In Blood Pact, we are introduced to the usual new type of supernatural character - in previous books, it's been demons, werewolves, mummy - this time it's zombies. We also get introduced to a type of character that's not supernatural, but none the less has its stereotype in the genre: the mad scientist. Vicki's mom dies, and Vicki travels toKingston to see to her burial - only, there isn't a body to bury. We do get some bits of farce, reminiscent of several classic movies, where people lose track of corpses, but there's nothing actually insensitive or offensive about it. Henry follows Vicki; Mike follows Henry, and soon the crew are interfering with the hapless campus police (Vicki's mom worked at a university) and the Kingston police.<br />I can't tell you too much more about this one without giving away the surprise ending, and it is indeed a surprise, one that will change the tone of the series, and of the characters' relationships, profoundly.

St. Germain is definitely a good guy, using the knowledge he's gained in several thousand years of living to help others. There are a few characters that continue from book to book besides him: the women he turns into vampires, and his &quot;servant,&quot; Roger, who is a ghoul. Ghouls are the only other supernatural characters who appear in these books. St. Germain can stand daylight with the right preparations. He has unusual strength, but not limitless, and unusual wisdom, and is an &quot;alchemist&quot; but there are no other overt magic powers. In most of the series, he has an occupation of being an aristocrat, inasmuch as that was a full-time occupation through most of history; in some books he has another &quot;job&quot; as well. St. Germain does not usually literally drink blood; he feeds on emotions, usually during erotic experiences, but sex is nonetheless only a minor plot element, rare and very discreet. Drinking blood is a substitute for when he can't get the emotional nourishment he prefers. The series covers 3000 years, from ancient Egypt to the modern day; each book is set in a span of a particular period, usually 20-30 years (this book, however, is the exception). The writing is serious, but not self-important; the writing quality is excellent, and Yarbro's abilities as an author qualify these books as literature rather than &quot;merely&quot; genre fiction.<br />Come Twilight breaks somewhat from the pattern of the series by covering a span of several hundred years, from about 650 CE to 1117 CE (AD) in four leaps. The book is set in Spain, before it was Spain; the periods covered include the Visigothic (when many of the natives still worshipped older religions, and Catholicism had scarcely made a dent); the Moorish, which lasted for hundreds of years, and finally, the beginnings of the Catholic re-taking of Spain and the emergence of Spain as the beginning of a unified &lt;i&gt;pais&lt;/i&gt;. Since the Moslem Moors are a much stronger power than the Catholics, they get to be the &quot;bad guys&quot; through much of the book. Yarbro's distaste for the Roman Catholic church in some of the series is more accurately a distaste for religions with too much worldly power and corruption. In this period, Islam was more powerful, and more corrupt, than Christianity, so it gets more criticism. (The Jews, always something of a wild card in history, play a small but significant role in this book.) Other reviews will tell you about the plot; let me point out the strong themes that Yarbro brings out here that have not been as prominent as in earlier books: the uses of actual blood; the part emotional nourishment plays in the development of any whole person, alive or undead, and the horrible effects of a lack of emotional bonds - you may compare this to some of the studies of children or monkeys deprived of emotional and physical contact with their mothers, and how stunted they are as adults. And a strong ecological message, where the deforestation of early Spain in order to build pieces of technology (ships, in this case) and to graze food animals, may serve as a warning for what is happening now in South America and other fading forest areas. Pardon the pun, but: this book provides much food for thought!s covered include the Visigothic (when many of the natives still worshipped older religions, and Catholicism had scarcely made a dent); the Moorish, which lasted for hundreds of years, and finally, the beginnings of the Catholic re-taking of Spain and the emergence of Spain as the beginning of a unified &lt;i&gt;pais&lt;/i&gt;. Since the Moslem Moors are a much stronger power than the Catholics, they get to be the &quot;bad guys&quot; through much of the book. Yarbro's distaste for the Roman Catholic church in some of the series is more accurately a distaste for religions with too much worldly power and corruption. In this period, Islam was more powerful, and more corrupt, than Christianity, so it gets more criticism. (The Jews, always something of a wild card in history, play a small but significant role in this book.)

Those who already know that they like vampire novels, anything at all that features a vampire, can skip this review, and likewise, those who hate the whole idea of vampires can skip it. But for those trying to decide whether or not to read more of this genre, or whether the one vampire novel you've already read was a fluke, it may help to have some ways to categorize these novels. Thus: BunRab's Standard Vampire Classification Guide. First, most authors of vampire novels approach from one of the main genres of genre fiction; thus their background may be primarily in romance, or in science fiction/fantasy, or in murder mysteries, or in horror. Second, many vampire novels come in series; knowing whether this is one of a series, and where in the series it falls, may be helpful. Then we have some particular characteristics: - Is the vampire character (or characters) a &quot;good guy&quot; or a &quot;bad guy&quot;? Or are there some of each? - Are there continuing characters besides the vampire, through the series?  - Are there other types of supernatural beings besides vampires? - Can the vampire stand daylight under some circumstances, or not stand daylight at all? - Does the vampire have a few other supernatural characteristics, many other supernatural characteristics, or none other than just being a vampire? (E.g., super strength, change into an animal, turn invisible) - Does the vampire have a regular job and place in society, or is being a vampire his or her entire raison d'etre? - Does the vampire literally drink blood, or is there some other (perhaps metaphorical) method of feeding? - Is sex a major plot element, a minor plot element, or nonexistent? - Is the entire vampire feeding act a metaphor for sex, part of a standard sex act, or unrelated to sex? - Is the story set in one historical period, more than one historical period, or entirely in the present day? - Does the story have elements of humor, or is it strictly serious? - Is the writing style good, or is the writing just there to manage to hold together the plot and characters?<br />Tanya Huff's series about the vampire Henry Fitzroy starts from the mystery and thriller genres (Huff also writes Fantasy), and is a continuing series. Fitzroy is a good guy, just leading a quiet life. The continuing characters include several types of humans: police officers, detectives, street people, family members. There are other supernatural characters, usually only one type per book (e.g., werewolves). Henry definitely can't stand daylight at all; it literally burns him. He has extraordinary strength and speed, and a sort of hypnotic influence but no &quot;magic&quot; powers. In fact, other than the existence of a few types of supernatural beings, there is little supernatural going in in the series - it's everyday modern Toronto, not a fantasy world. He's got a day job - er, make that a night job: he's a writer. He drinks blood, usually from consenting adults, sometimes associated with sex, but not necessarily. There is sex in the books, but it's a minor plot element, not graphically detailed. These stories are there for the mystery/thriller elements; romance is only a sideline. Huff allows the characters to have a sense of humor: witty dialogue, a way with words. Some of the characters are set up for humor and farce as well, although not in a crude or gross way. The writing is well above average for &quot;genre fiction&quot; and the books are quite enjoyable to read.<br />Blood Trail continues with Vicki getting to know Henry better, as they take a trip out to a rural town to help out some friends of Henry's. The friends are a nice family of sheep farmers who just happen to be werewolves as well. Somebody is trying to kill off the werewolves. One member of the family isn't a farmer- he's a police constable. The dialogue between Colin and his partner officer Barry, who is of Asian descent, is funny - since both were the only minorities, they banded together at Police Academny and have stuck together since. Their comradeship includes the exchange of buddy insults: &quot;Sheep-f - -er.&quot; &quot;Yellow Peril.&quot; Guy stuff. In the meantime, Mike Celucci, the Toronto cop, is worried about Vicki being off somewhere with Henry, and decides to investigate Henry's background. The conclusions he jumps to from the lack of background he finds lead, of course, to a wonderful fight with Vicki. Along the way, we also meet a religious nut/gardener and his sleazy con-man nephew; a little old lady in tennis shoes who is a championship rifle shooter, and a few other odd characters. The details of werewolf family life are nicely done.er officer Barry, who is of Asian descent, is funny - since both were the only minorities, they banded together at Police Academny and have stuck together since.

St. Germain is definitely a  good guy, using the knowledge he's gained in several thousand years of  living to help others. There are a few characters that continue from book to  book besides him: the women he turns into vampires, and his &quot;servant,&quot;  Roger, who is a ghoul. Ghouls are the only other supernatural characters  who appear in these books. St. Germain can stand daylight with the right  preparations. He has unusual strength, but not limitless; unusual wisdom;  and is an &quot;alchemist&quot; but there are no overt &quot;magic&quot; powers. In most of  the series, he has an occupation of being an aristocrat, insofar as that was a  full-time occupation through most of history; in some books he has another  &quot;job&quot; as well. St. Germain does not literally drink blood; he feeds on  emotions, usually during erotic experiences, but sex is nonetheless only a  minor plot element, rare and very discreet. The series covers 3000 years,  from ancient Egypt to the modern day; each book is set in a span of a  particular period, usually 20-30 years. The writing is serious, but not  self-important; the writing quality is excellent, and Yarbro's abilities as an  author qualify these books as literature rather than &quot;merely&quot; genre fiction.<br />Darker Jewels is set in the Russia of Ivan the Awe-Inspiring (or Terrible). Ivan is insane, his son Feodor is retarded, and all the other noble families of Russia are jockeying for power and hoping to take over ruling the country. Intothis, St. Germain is sent as an ambassador from Poland. As an alchemist, St. Germain makes jewels in his athanor; since Ivan is obsessed with jewels, St. Germain can make him gifts to win favor for the Polish king. As is usual in this series, the Roman Catholic church provides some villains, in the form of a group of Jesuits, ambitious, narrow-minded, and arrogant (with the obligatory one exception who is flexible, kind, and despised by the rest of the priests). The Eastern Orthodox Church also plays a strong role; the descriptions of Russian Orthodox churches and rituals are fascinating. Another nice touch is the English delegation to Russian, from the court of Elizabeth I. Some nice characters there, and a connection with Olivia Clemens through one of them.

So the characters include some of the most famous people of the Italian Renaissance. Although this is only the second book written in the series, Yarbro is clearly setting up more background  on St. Germain, for future novels. In this historical period, it's easy to make the Roman Catholic church a villain; the infamous Savonarola is in Florence, setting up his Bonfire of the Vanities. Warning: some torture scenes. On the other hand, there is at least a partly happy ending. One disappointment to me is that St. Germain turns a woman into a vampire in this book, and yet, as far as I can tell, she never again appears in the series, unlike Olivia Clemens. Once someone is &quot;of his blood&quot; I would expect to see them turn up as a recurring character. We can also, after all the harm he causes, count it a happy ending when Savonarola is executed.

St Germain starts out in China, in the first story. As China grows suspicious of foreigners, due to the incursions of the Mongols (it's the early 13th century), St. Germain finds it prudent to leave the city, and travel to an outpost. There, he is to help defend a fortress from the Mongols. The fortress is unusual in having a female Warlord. This section of the book is a good read for the plot, the strategy, and the unusualness of the setting. Where many of us are somewhat familiar with the historical setting of the series when they take place in Europe or the Americas, we tend to be far less familiar with the history of the Orient.

There is also a &quot;side&quot; story about some traveling Nestorian Christians, with hints of Yarbro's opinions as to how Christianity might alternatively have developed.<br />After the fortress falls, finally, St. Germain escapes by way of Tibet, where along the journey he meets a child Master at a Buddhist lamasary.

Olivia, the heroine of this book, is a woman of ancient Rome whom St. Germain has turned into a vampire; this book is one of several written about her rather than about St. Germain. St. Germain and Olivia are definitely good guys, using the knowledge they've gained in hundreds of  years of living to help others. There are a few characters that continue from book to book besides these two. Ghouls are the only other supernatural characters who appear in these books. Olivia  can stand daylight with the right preparations. She has unusual strength, but not limitless, and unusual wisdom, but there are no other overt magic powers. Olivia has an occupation of being an aristocrat and landowner, insofar as that was a full-time occupation through most of history. Yarbro's vampires do not literally drink blood; they feed on emotions, usually during erotic experiences, but sex is nonetheless only a minor plot element, rare and very discreet. The series as a whole covers 3000 years, from ancient Egypt to the modern day; each book is set in a span of a particular period, usually 20-30 years. The writing is serious, but not self-important; the writing quality is excellent, and Yarbro's abilities as an author qualify these books as literature rather than &quot;merely&quot; genre fiction.<br />Crusader's Torch is set in 1189 C.E., more than a millenium after Olivia has first entered the life of a vampire. The scenes include the Middle East during one of the Christian Crusades; the orders of the Knights Hospitaler and Knights Templar are major players in the story.  The gist of the story is Olivia's struggle to get out of Tyre and back to Rome. Women are not held in high regard in this period, and Olivia's independence offends a highly placed Hospitaler; among the &quot;good guys&quot; are a Templar who gets thrown out of his order on suspician of leprosy. We catch a glimpse of an offshoot Christian sect, as we do in some of the other St. Germain novels, one based on absolute love and acceptance. Someday I would like to see Yarbro write an alternate history in which that is the main path the Catholic Church took... meanwhile, the details of sin and penance as conceived of in the 12th century provide a story that everyone who likes the series will enjoy, and those who haven't read the rest of the series will nonetheless find this a fine historical novel.f Tyre and back to Rome.

The Catholic Church has contributed much toward keeping the populace ignorant and downtrodden, a recurrent theme in the series. At this period of history, there is not yet a full-blown Inquisition as there will be a couple of centuries later. Part of the conflict in the story is due to the schism in the Catholic Church, where a second Pope has been set up in France, in Avignon. Letters between St. Germain and his fellow immortal, Olivia, every few chapters, help set the changing scenes. There is a helpful character in the form of a persecuted Spanish Jew; this novel also has a relatively happy ending, in that there is not a huge final bloodbath featuring war, torture, etc. - perhaps, in the face of the Plague, we do not need further human tortures to keep things active.

(about 60 C.E.) The book is the third one written in the series; it is one of the earliest in terms of historical chronology. Despite being the third one written, it is a good one to start with if one is first starting the whole series, because this is the book in which St. Germain acquires his bondsman, Roger, who will be a continuing character in the series. The spectacles at the Circus Maximus form a large part of the book, along with the corruption of Roman politics. The book is well titled; there is a great deal of blood and violence both in and out of the arena. Atta Olivia Clemens is the wife of Senator Cornelius Justus Silius, one of the most corrupt and perverse of the Romans. St. Germain rescues her from his cruelties through bringing her &quot;to his life,&quot; that is, turning her into a vampire also. Olivia will be a continuing character in the series for another millenium and a half. An epilogue set in the 855th Year of the City gives perspective, and establishes the pattern of letters between Olivia and St. Germain which is used in future books of the series to set the scene and bring us up to date.<br />Those who already know that they like vampire novels, anything at all that features a vampire, can skip this review, and likewise, those who hate the whole idea of vampires can skip it.

And if you are expecting a textbook in the sciences, or a single train of thought about philosophy, this is not the book you are looking for.<br />  I preface the rest of my review with the information that I am a grad student in the social sciences, and that I freely admit that the social sciences are a poor second best to the hard sciences. I would gladly rather study physics or math, or even computer science or engineering, if I had the background and the brains. From this point of view, then, let me say that I perceive many of the postmodern philosophers as people who apparently aren't smart enough to understand science, and therefore they wish to denigrate science in order to raise their own esteem. These types feel that if they can't do science, then the problem should be that science isn't what it thinks it is, rather than that they aren't as smart as they think they are.<br />Sokal and Bricmont manage to point out the depths of these philosophers' misunderstandings of, or complete ignorance of, the sciences they write about, in fairly clear language. At some points, the explanations of the physics and math involved may be a little more complex than the average reader will understand; it is nonetheless reassuring that those explanations are provided. That is, that there is a reality to those subjects, which can be explained, in contrast to the ambiguous and inexplicable hash that social theorists make of it.<br />Some of the abuses discussed: does the field of fluid mechanics have gender implications? Can psychology be completely explained in terms of the mathematics of topology? If these questions make perfect sense to you, then you will be annoyed by this book. If, one the other hand, these questions make you say &quot;HUH?!?!?&quot; and think of trying to mix apples and oranges, or camelopards and wombats, then you will enjoy the book.ill enjoy the book.	2000-12-29

Ms. Tannen jumps from topic to topic in short spurts, sometimes with little connection. Overall, though, this is a book that should make most people stop and think. Tannen says that we tend to frame too many things in terms of &quot;both sides&quot; even when there are possibly many more than two opposing possible ways of viewing a situation or idea. Even our educational system is framed in an adversarial manner, with debate and criticism being thought more intelligent than synthesis and agreement. In the last section of the book, she provides some ideas for practicing a less adversarial style: instead of having two &quot;opposing&quot; panelists or debaters on every talk show or in every classroom, have three or more people, to make it clear that there are not just the two extremes. If people try and make you declare yourself in one of two &quot;warring camps,&quot; refuse to allow yourself to be shoveled into an all-or-nothing point of view.<br />I think this book should be on the required-reading list for dispute-resolution courses and training - and for lawyers!!	2000-12-22

Schor's basic thesis is that Americans used to be satisfied with keeping up with the Joneses down the street, in their own neighborhood, but now we feel we must keep up with the rich and famous we see on TV.<br />In the introduction, Ralph Nader mentions another book, _Fat and Mean : The Corporate Squeeze of Working Americans and the Myth of Managerial 'Downsizing'_, which is also worth reading. Add to that another book, _Why We Buy : The Science of Shopping_, which I've also read. It's about how marketers induce people to shop and buy. Taken together, the three books will make you think, and definitely give you a basis for rejecting overt commercialism. You'll think twice about your next purchase in a store! (Except for books, of course; buying books is GOOD!) _	2000-10-02

This book actually focuses more on the street cops than on the detectives, a change of pace. We learn more about Cindy Decker. Not as much about Peter Decker and his family. There are several hints at a developing love interest for Cindy - which I would bet won't develop successfully, but which do indicate that we are going to see more of Cindy in the future. One disappointment: the ending was just a little unrealistic. Oh yeah, it is a surprise, and I'm not giving it away here - but I didn't like the end as much as I liked the rest of the book.<br />If you are newly discovering Faye Kellerman's series, this probably isn't the book you should start with - while you wouldn't be hopelessly lost, you will enjoy this one more if you know more background about the characters by reading a couple of the earlier books first. One important character in this book was first introduced in _Jupiter's Bones_, the preceding book. Read a couple of them, then read _Stalker_.	2000-09-20

Shirley McClintock runs a guest ranch, along with her live-in companion, JQ; a retired friend, Xanthippe, who also lives with them, and Shirley's adopted daughter Allison. Besides the main plot, which involves an almost-anonymous guest dying after Shirley and JQ rush her to the hospital, there's also a subplot in which we find out more about Allison's family.<br />Semi-&quot;spoiler&quot; (don't read this paragraph if you want absolutely no hint as to the resolution of the plot) - Oliphant manages to neatly skewer both UFO/alien encounter nuts, and &quot;repressed memory&quot; therapists who see Satanism everywhere. If you like clear, logical thinking about these issues, you'll enjoy how they are brought into the plot and then treated as the pseudoscience they are.	2000-09-20

He speaks to us  &quot;from the death chamber in Huntsville&quot; (Texas). Those of us from  Texas have long had cause to be ashamed of that particular place, but  Vonnegut's use of it may be the only one that wouldn't embarrass us.<br />The  &quot;interview&quot; with Isaac Asimov is priceless. You will be pleased  to hear that Asimov is still writing, although avoiding the embarrassment  of publishing new books years after he's dead (unlike, say, L. Ron.)	2000-08-29

Have you ever wondered why you couldn't just use the paint they use for nuclear power plants, for your house? Wouldn't it be a lot more durable? David Owen has wondered - and visited the manufacturer who makes nuke  paint, to get the answers.<br />Also among the choicest bits in a book that  is full of great moments: the description of a layer of ugly wallpaper over  a layer of ugly paint over a layer of ugly wallpaper over a layer of ugly  paint...<br />Read this book during that break from stripping paint; have a  tall glass of iced tea with it. And rejoice in the fact that even though  it's 100 degrees and you're working on your house, at least you are not on  an aluminum ladder near electrical lines in the rain.<br />I give copies of  this book to friends as housewarming gifts for their first house...; we had to buy two copies for ourselves, as we  don't want to run the risk of losing our only copy if someone borrows it.	2000-08-25

We have decided to adopt at least one item each year from the book as a New Years resolution. They range from the very easy (Clean your roof! Check for leaks!) to the advanced-skill or hire-a-contractor level. But all are detailed, and explain why they are included. Some do not apply to every house, such as the basement hints, but everyone will find something that applies to their house. The book is written in language that you don't have to be a builder to understand; you don't even have to be an experienced do-it-yourselfer to get started. Warning: after starting this book, you will become very paranoid about what could go wrong in your house! However, this is a good thing, as paranoia is the first step toward preservation.	1997-10-27

This book not only provides the nitty gritty of keeping the  porch on an old house from falling apart, it gives the history of porches, details about the lifestyles lived on porches  in the 19th and 20th centuries, and lots of photos of porches. Look here for the historically appropriate railings for an early Victorian porch, or the furniture to put on your turn-of the century porch. Amusing stories of the famous, views of hotels noted for their porches; serving tea on  the porch - this book isn't just a how-to, it's a why-was-it and why-keep-it that will  add to your knowlege of the history of houses.	1997-09-27

Berlioz was not just a composer/conductor, and in his writings, not just a music critic and explainer. He had a keen eye for explaining the cultural milieu of his time. In _Salons de l'Orchestre_ (Evenings with the Orchestra), he presents the gossip and scandals about performing artists of his day and the generations immediately previous to it, in the guise of the chatting done by members of the pit orchestra of an opera company. His descriptions of the opera company and orchestra itself are a hilarious study in the personality types who wind up in mediocre musical jobs. After you read this book, you will never be able to watch a public TV simulcast of classical music again without snickering when the camera focuses on the bass drum	1997-04-18
