He is mostly successful.  This work slightly more accessible than Grudem or Erickson and would provide a competent introduction to a beginning student of theology.  It is actually more of a joint introduction to historical and systematic (since he does not actually begin to tackle the systematic categories until 205 pages in) and it works well as such, but it leaves him very limited room to build a comprehensive \\"Christian Theology\\".<br /><br />My main critique of this is that despite his space limitations McGrath often gets sidetracked, devoting large chunks of text to advanced or non-central topics (which, to be fair, I often enjoyed) that detract from the general, introductory appeal he claimed to be persuing.  This is most egregious under the doctrine of God where the debate over the suffering of God, theodicy and God's gender comprise nearly half the text.  Still, if you are looking get a joint intro to historical and systematic theology while \\"only\\" investing 500 pages (rather than the very worthwhile 1000 + or - of Grudem or Erickson) McGrath is a fantastic guide and this text would fit those purposes well.	2005-10-08

All the date setting and charts, mil's and trib's made my head spin and just seemed to be a distraction from the heart of the faith.  However, when I was finally forced to tackle it, I (unsurprisingly) found myself in able hands with Grenz.  He is even handed, biblically literate, historically comprehensive and, ultimately, relevant.<br /><br />He conducts biblical and historical surveys of postmillennialism, dispensationalism, historic premillennialism and amillennialism with balance and insight. (I actually found the postmil chapter the most interesting as my unilateral association with it and old line Liberalism was patently discredited).  He closes with two profound chapters about how any of these millennial positions will impact personal and church theology and practice and finally some thoughts \\"corporate eschatology.\\"  Very much recommended if you are planning to tackle this subject.	2005-10-08

Boyd and Eddy do a fantastic job of appropriately representing the various positions on a number of confusing topics.  With only two exceptions (The Threefold Self and the Cessationist View on the Gifts) I found myself either agreeing or saying \\"Wow, I guess I see how someone with a high view of scripture can actually believe that.\\"  Oh, and there is an on-line appendix that covers another 12 topics.<br /><br /> I agree with some of the reviewers that a couple of the positions (e.g. the openness of God) I would not include in self designated evangelical discussion.  However, in the author's defense, there are individuals and movements that would like to both call themselves evangelicals and hold these positions, so they are worth being informed about.<br /><br /> The text focuses on the biblical data with lesser space devoted to philosophical arguments and appeals to church history.  This is not a devotional text (look elsewhere for that).  However, on the whole it is a worthwhile and accessible 263 pages that will help a reader defend their position, understand the diversity in their movement and give a hearing to the vast reservoir of Biblical data.	2005-10-08

The falcon guide does a good job organizing the park, providing acceptable overview references, including compelling photography (for black and white) and selecting a diversity of hike distances.  There short hikes, moderate and long day hikes and multi-day excursions (though the emphasis is on the latter two).  You sill need to print out a map from the national park service web site to orient yourself in the park as you flip through the pages (I often felt lost with just the couple of overview maps) but in general it is a really helpful guide.	2005-10-08

Unfortunately his writings were so copious and obscured under the cloak of pseudonyms that many people give up before they begin to mine the riches of his work.  Moore has finally provided an accessible distillation of his work in this topical compilation.  There are 98 topics (e.g. doubt, love, faith/reason, despair, risk, passion...) which either contain single, important passages or a series of quotes from various works.  I often found myself laughing out loud.<br /><br /> Unlike many Kierkegaard scholars who insist on anachronistically viewing him through his twentieth century French interpreters, Moore has a sense for passions, wit and contributions of the Danish philosopher.  A caution: SK out of context can often be misinterpreted since he usually speaks in a voice not his own, intended to incite passionate response.  However, I would still highly recommend it to anyone who has either a deep interest or a passing curiosity in Kierkegaard or a passionate, authentic life of action in general.<br /><br />(Note: the text of this is also available in a free, searchable pdf on-line).	2005-10-08

'Old books' can speak with voices outside of the biases of our time and document the inter-generational story of Christ and his Church.  Classics that have been beneficial for centuries are more likely to be beneficial than the latest glossy at the local bookstore.<br /><br />However, it can be next to impossible to know where to start.  That is where Foster has provided a great service with this text.  He organizes 52 devotional excerpts from throughout the history of the church that speak lucidly and counterculturalally to our generation.  The format is designed for devotional use with a short bio, 3 page excerpt, related scripture, discussion questions and suggested action steps.  It would be a great resource for a personal time of reflection or some sort of discussion group.  It is the best $10.88 I have spent in a long time. I'm buying copies for all my friends.	2005-05-21

It turned out that every trip I had done, heavily considered, or that was on my \\"to do\\" list was included.  Any book that tries to cover a topic as broad as \\"Backpacking California\\" is going have limitations - but the authors pick the absolute best of the coast, Desolation, south Cascades, Tahoe, Yosemite, Kings/Sequoia, Ansel Adams, Inyo and more.  There is also good variety of distances and almost a third of the trips are loops.  The maps are very good and trail statistics are helpful.  My only complaint is the absence of elevation profiles (a total gain/loss number is offered) so the \\"Sierra South\\"/\\"Sierra North\\" books make good companions to this one.  However, if you are going to own just one backpacking guide for your first 5 years of backpacking in CA or are just visiting and want to pick from the best, this is the book to have.	2005-05-21

This is what happens when a poet who shared a historical context and cultural milieu (and a mistress) with Nietzsche has a dramatic experience of God and writes furiously about it.  There is a edge to these poems; the raw energy of fresh conversion, flirting with questions those who 'know better' don't ask anymore and exalting in the shaking of his foundations.<br /><br />I mean check this stuff out:<br /><br />\\"I am strange to myself, as though someone unknown<br /><br />had poisoned my mother as she carried me...<br /><br />Into (your hands) I place these fragments, my life,<br /><br />and you, God-spend them however you want.\\"<br /><br />or this:<br /><br />\\"Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror.<br /><br />Just keep going.

I tended to find them fragmented; good at organizing particular movements but not framing the different movements in the context of a historical narrative.  This text however, is one, large chart, or actually 3 on different scales (one single page timeline, one 5 pager and one that's 226 pages); which really helps develop a mental map of historical events and thought.  It lists people, events, and movements of note in a large chronological grid.  While this may not be particularly helpful for understanding connections between movements or individuals (though the 19 denominational flow charts in the end help), it is a fantastic organizational framework for developing a historical theology.	2005-05-21

However, I had to comment on this fantastic, underrated text.  SK wrote in his journal that while he often used pseudonyms in his other works, in part, to distance himself from the ideas, in this book the pen name was employed to distance the ideas from him, feeling himself an imperfect messenger.  If we have any access at all to the center of SK's program, this is it, yet it is rarely mentioned as an important work of his authorship.<br /><br />There is no doubt that Either/Or, Fear and Trembling and Concluding Unscientific Postscript are all brilliant.  However, Practice in Christianity deserves every bit as much attention as these works.  It is a work of self disclosure calling the reader to examine the basis for their faith and confront the startling choice between imitation and offense based on the risky prospect of embracing paradox.  It is also one of SK's most accessible texts that can be read devotionally.  One of my favorite books ever.	2005-05-21

While first half of the book is much more technical than the second half, both are accessible to the non-specialist.  I hadn't taken Biology since High School and was able to process most of the material with minimal referencing of secondary sources.  Both authors are good writers who incorporate subtle humor and have the ability to convey some of their passion for fish making this a somewhat less dry text book than the general tendency.

However, his life of abandon in the service of God and his willingness to take on colonial powers demands respect despite his association with the colonial program.  Far too little literature on him remains in print and this is, by far, the best volume available.  After a brief but effective biography (and a very helpful map tracking the journeys) the bulk of the text consists of Xavier's letters back to Ignatius and the Society of Jesus chronicling his 10 years in Portugal, India, Indonesia, Japan and China.  While often culturally distant (and potentially objectionable given justifiable modern perception of colonialism) the passion and abandon of his accounts, rebukes and pleas are deeply moving and a challenge to the modern church.	2005-04-28

If you have time to read entire chapters of this book before your visit to Mississippi it will certainly provide helpful information.  The book provides back stories and insider tips.  However, this guide is not well organized or efficient to use.  There is no easy summary of must sees - or quick ways to find a particular destination.  Also, it can be difficult to find sites highlighted in the book if you are not familiar with local roads - you almost need to plan ahead of time and prepare mapquest maps.  While the authors did tip me off to some very worthwhile diversions that augmented my visit (e.g. the Natchez trail is fantastic) and gave me back-story on some of the towns which I appreciated, it was often more work to get at this information than I would have hoped for from a travel guide.	2005-04-28

Muggeridge is firmly planted in this tradition and is an able spokesperson for those before him.  His treatments of Pascal, Kierkegaard and Bonhoeffer were basic enough that they could serve as introductions but substantial enough that despite the fact that I have read much by and about these men, I found their treatment in \\"Third Testament\\" both informative and moving.  It is his treatment of Tolstoy, however, that really stands out as his very personal connection with Russian culture and people gives it a particular poignancy.  Contemporary Christianity could benefit a great deal by reflecting on the approach of contemplation, passion and rigor that is represented by the biographies in this book. Muggeridge has done and excellent job bringing them to us.	2005-04-28

So I was very excited to happen upon this study guide.  Unfortunately, it was a bit of a missed opportunity.  After outstanding studies of the Habakkuk and Isa 58 Hunter makes only two more forays into the Old Testament (questionable choices in Jonah and Exodus) in favor of New Testament topics that I would categorize as ecclesiology.  I would assert that Bible study on justice probably shouldn't make camp in the book of Acts for a quarter of its content.  Perhaps this should have been called \\"Biblical Community\\" or \\"A Theology of Culture and Possessions\\" (which appear to be the author's interests and are not unimportant topics) leaving room for a guide in this series that actually tackles a Biblical Theology of Justice.  With that said, I did buy 10 copies to distribute in my church because there is not really a comparable layperson's guide out there...I was just hoping for more reliance on Biblical categories of justice.	2005-04-28

It is a surprisingly thick book with lots of trails; unfortunately most of them are either short tourist strolls or long, multi-day back country excursions.  We had difficulty finding hikes that called out to us in the 12-16 mile range (usually not a problem for us - most guides leave us wishing we had 2 weeks to do all the long day hikes we are interested in) and ended up going with ranger recommendations when we got there.  If you have 5-10 days for a backcountry trek, this is definitely the book for you.  But if you are looking for long day hikes you may want to look elsewhere.	2005-04-28

This is a serviceable introduction to the writings and life of Soren Kierkegaard (SK).  It hits several of his major works and emphases and does a pretty good job unpacking some difficult concepts (dread, despair, irony etc..).  Palmer falls into a common trap, however, of interpreting SK through the lens of the twentieth century existentialists that utilize him.  There was a point in the text where I had serious questions whether he had quoted Sartre more than SK himself (it is of note that Palmer also wrote Sartre for Beginners).  This leads at times to anachronism in Palmer's presentation and less than full treatment of those ideas that were important to SK but dismissed by those who followed (namely passionate, ironic and devotional theological prose).  The illustrations were typical of what I have come to expect from this series: helpful aids for visual learners, occasionally comical (there is a great one on Woody Allen's take on the intro to Sickness Unto Death), but usually a little disappointing, particularly considering the vast reservoir of ironic and comical material availed by SK's sharp wit and various pseudonyms.	2004-09-20

Trail selection and details are very good and the trail maps and elevation profiles are extraordinary.  Unlike most guides there is no hesitation to repeat a map a couple of pages apart if it will be helpful to the reader.  The primary drawback of the book is that it lacks big picture planning tools like a map that puts the different sections of the book in perspective.  A downloaded trail map from the national park service web site supplements it nicely.  Additionally there seems to be more detailed coverage of Sequoia than King's canyon.  Overall, however, it was a very helpful guide in planning a fantastic backcountry experience.	2004-09-20

Faith and wealth proceeds systematically and insightfully through the reflections of all the major document of early Christianity on the topics of wealth and the poor.

Despite having fewer rides (67 versus the other two which each have a hundred) the trail information is presented in such a way to allow for efficient trail selection and detailed understanding of the trail's difficulty.  Each ride is accompanied by a map depicting where in CA it is, a helpful schematic of the trail and an elevation profile of the ride.  The books best feature is that each trail does not get a single difficulty score, but the elevation profile is broken up into sections that are each assigned a difficulty category (from 1 to 5).  The rides tend to be on the intermediate to advanced side (though some good beginner single track is included) and there are no paved or easy rides (which the other two books include).  To date I have found the trailhead directions and trail descriptions to be accurate and lively.	2004-08-04

His attempt to summarize the major movements and developments in the first four centuries of the church in Volume one was more successful than the following synthesis of a thousand years in fewer pages.  The early church and ecumenical councils develop in a manner linear enough that are amenable to this sort of treatment.

The roadside guides identify appropriate points of interest and do a good job describing their significance.  My only major complaint typifies each of the offerings in this series.  The geologic maps (which I believe are the most helpful tool in Geologic synthesis) are in red, black and white are not very clear at all but there are a number of other helpful diagrams that make the text more readable.  The text might be a bit of a slog for someone without a Geology background but would not be impossible and should be fairly accessible with just a little initiation.

Are there really only a couple viable guide books?  Well, we selected this one, and while not our favorite format, it passed a fairly difficult pragmatic test.  With 2/3 of the park closed due to fire we were still able to select outstanding hikes and make good comparative decisions with this book and a topo.  The descriptions of the hikes are very good, the maps aren't bad (ridges are shaded and glaciers hatched, no topos) and the profiles (e.g. mileage vs elevation plots) provide very important information for a park where vertical gain is one of the central attractions and ridges must be traversed for nearly any destination.  Photos are sparse and do not help as much as one would like with trail selection (few shots of destinations or views left me saying - `I have to see that, it will be well worth the 16 miles' - which is what I want from hiking guide photos) but on the whole this is a very serviceable book that was the primary guide to our great Glacier experience.	2004-08-04

Comparisons are made to Socrates, Descartes, Kant, Bhuddah, and Marx, some almost certainly intended in the film and other likely projected.  The Matrix is a philosophical film and the first time I saw it I heard the voices of Descartes and Kant.  It was refreshing to have some rigorous guidance for the way down the rabbit hole and the process of making connections between the movie, classical philosophy and current world views.  The text is technical but accessible.  The essays are more in the rhetorical style of college lecture halls than dining halls and the reader should be prepared for some rigor - but it is well worth it.  There is a lot of repetition between chapters and some essays were definitely more interesting than others (Gregory Bassham's The Religion of The Matrix and the Problems of Pluralism and Theodore Schick's Fate, Freedom, and Foreknowledge, in particular, were winners) but that is the advantage of a modular document - the essays stand alone and you can read from cover to cover or sample.

Arbaugh and Arbaugh do an excellent job providing context for the `authorship' on the whole and dealing with each specific work.

Fortey's prose tend to ramble (the book just uses too many words to say what it has to say) but the content makes the prose (which, in fairness, often were entertaining) well worth wading through.  I had the advantage of a keen ambient interest in the critters going into the book but Fortey's command of the key discoveries and their implications is outstanding and his passion for trilobites is contagious.  The book could use about twice the figures, but has included over 25 including some very instructive ones.  On the whole a worthwhile read.	2003-10-03

This fascinating, popularly written text focuses on the critters of the early Cambrian and a bold interpretation of their fossils that insinuate a rapid diversification of multicultural life, referred to by some as the \\"Cambrian explosion\\".  It also becomes a platform from which Gould expands upon several of the general observations on Natural History that emerge as themes from his essay collections.  His uncompromising fidelity to the data (interpreting what he sees rather than what he thinks he should see), his gift for weaving a narrative around a bunch of rocks, and the importance of the animals of the early Cambrian combine to make this a truly outstanding text.  Far from widely accepted, this rendering has sparked debate in the paleontology community and is often referenced in popular scientific literature.  I highly recommend it.	2003-10-03

If you are looking for a narrative biography (or even a summary of Calvin's teachings) I would look somewhere else.  In either of those categories I would have given this 2 or 3 stars.  But this Bouswama's work is not intended to be either of these.  It would almost be best described as a reflection on Calvin's psychology as expressed in his major themes.  The themes chosen are not those that I would have.  However, I would estimate that nearly a quarter of this text is composed of direct Calvin quotes, and the author displays a fairly high level of rigor and competence with respect to Calvin's body of work.  There were times that I was unhappy with inferences made from some of the reformers statements and tracking some quotes to the source left myself and others I have talked to wondering about the consistency of the author's fidelity to context.  However, on the whole it is a helpful text that provides a non-traditional (but not necessarily negative) view of John Calvin.  I would not recommend it as an introduction, but it is an interesting analysis for advanced study.	2003-10-03

Yorath and Gadd have put together a really helpful resource that I highly recommend to anyone with even a little geologic interest that is planning on some time in Jasper.  The beginning of the book is a concise, well crafted overview of the regions geology with sufficient, well selected diagrams to make the text move along nicely.  The second part of the book is a list of sites of interest in the park with a discussion of their geologic significance.  The text comes with a geologic map of reasonable size with the sites of interest marked on it.  Very helpful resource for understanding the regions geology and seeing the evidence of important processes typical of this unique system.	2003-10-03
US	42310044	RD7OEYUR8VA1V	0060633166	405787417	2: The Story of Christianity: Volume Two - The Reformation to the Present Day	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Perfect Starting Point	A very helpful introduction.  The text is accessible and lucid.  Gonzalez does a good job framing church movements in the context of general trends of thought and covers key secular thinkers and movements where appropriate.  He also does well covering the whole church and following the developments of the papacy, Catholic church, and Orthodox.  However, this leads to the treatment of eras in parallel accountings rather than a linear narrative which was confusing at times.  The pictures are fun, timeline could be more helpful in its presentation, and while I would have liked more maps, this text has the most helpful maps of those that I read on this era.  It is also not referenced but it does have extensive recommended readings.  I would highly recommend this as an introductory text on Church History as part of (or in preparation for) a class or for personal interest.	2003-10-03

A pretty quick read as the text is written at a reasonable level for most introductory readers.  Provides good coverage of the whole church during this period, including Catholic and Orthodox reformations.  It is generally my contention that church history texts are not written for spatial or visual learners due to the common lack of maps and timelines, but this text sets a new standard as it only contains two total maps/figures/pictures.  Not referenced, light recommended readings, good index.  On the whole an enjoyable and helpful book for the front end of a study of the reformation, but not my favorite.	2003-10-03

Books	4	6	7	N	N	Compelling Technical Polemic	I found Wenham's argument more compelling than I had expected.  The data he surveys on the connectin between Paul and the gospels is far more exaustive than the dozen+ other books I looked at on the general topic of Paul's Chritology combined and is generally well structured. My main critique is of his strategy of lumping evidence of widely varying likelyhood.  This resulted in very thin allusions coinciding with strong cases.  On the whole though, it is a well put together volume andworth the pages.	2003-01-04

He surveys ranges of views and Biblical data on the standard systematic catagories (and some additions) and interacts with secular and scintific data with competance and humility.  He does not inovate for its own sake but deals honestly with input from both specific and general revelation. It was the most compelling 1200 pages I have read in some time.	2003-01-04

His discussion is helpful and accesable. He deals with individual thinkers and cultural trends enough to be complete but not enough to overwhelm someone getting started on the 20th century.  He has an excellant grasp of the scollarly and cultural aspects of the trends corperately referred to as postmodernism.<br />There was some nearly verbatum repetition which could have been avoided.  However, on the whole this was one of the most enjoyable and helpful books I have read in some time...the first A+ I've given this year.	2001-10-26
