The Mom Inventor's Handbook is a very detailed, hands on guide for taking an invention from idea to reality. There are several things I believe make it so useful: it's relevant and recent (no outdated advice here), it's based on real-world experience from an inventor and the others she has mentored, and it offers myriad resources to implement her advice. The examples of moms who have had success also make it inspirational.<br /><br />I also liked how the author uses examples that clearly illustrate what she is advising. For examples, she gives before and after pictures of the packaging design for her invention, the TP Saver when illustrating design elements.<br /><br />I interviewed the author about the book on my Internet radio show, EverydayWealthRadio, and found her to be very knowledgeable. If you've been thinking of inventing a product, this is a book you must have.	2005-10-13

It focuses in on a critical aspect of car buying -- your credit. What's intriguing is that Marine explains how having a good credit rating can be equally dangerous in the process as not having a good rating. I interviewed the author on my Internet radio program, EverydayWealth Radio, about the book and he clearly knew what he was talking about and wants to help consumers. On a final note, it's an easy and enjoyable read.	2005-09-30

The authors credentials make it very valuable because he comes from the \\"other side\\" and can tell taxpayers how the IRS really works. He truly is an \\"insider.\\"<br /><br />His book is not a lot of hype on tricky loopholes, but very solid advice for dealing with what can be a very frightening situation.

I know the authors from interviewing them for my Internet radio show, [...] and other articles, and I know they are very careful in the resources and information they present. I also believe they really do have the consumer's best interest at heart.<br /><br />As a consumer educator myself, I know some of the information -- especially related to finances -- is crucial. I've talked with so many people over the years who have been burned because they thought everything was taken care of with the divorce decree. Unfortunately, that's not the final word on how things will work out! That is especially true with regard to credit. If you have joint accounts PLEASE read their warnings or you may likely get stuck with your ex's bad credit for years.<br /><br />Even if you have a great divorce attorney, he or she won't have time to cover all the topics in this book with you, so I recommend it to make sure you're well-informed. One more caveat -- make sure you get the 2nd edition of this book, which is the most recent!	2005-09-18

I've watched his success, heard him speak on electronic marketing and have used some of his recommended services (like KickStartCart).<br /><br />The Ultimate Guide to Electronic Marketing for Small Business is a great blueprint for a successful ebusiness. I've had websites for years and frankly haven't invested enough energy to make them profitable. I am going through this guide step by step to implement Tom's advice.<br /><br />I am glad this book is not overly technical and that anyone who wants to learn about internet marketing can follow it. I am frankly surprised that someone would say it's too basic -- I've worked with people who supposedly really \\"know computers\\" but who don't know or implement the basic advice in this book.<br /><br />I interviewed Tom about this book on my radio show on EverydayWealthRadio.com and you can listen to his archived interview if you want to know more about his approach.

I don't know how he and his editor managed it, but this book doesn't seem to contain any fluff or distractions or extraneous text. I had the feeling that every word was just right. It drew me in, kept me entertained, and challenged some of my long-held notions.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book and the opportunity to interview Fred about it. (You can listen to the interview if you'd like). It's purely delightful, and has some very relevant applications not just to work, but to what's going on in the world today in terms of terrorism, Katrina, etc. I highly recommend it!	2005-09-02

As a consumer educator, I've heard many stories of people whose finances were ruined by a partner. Credit problems from a failed relationship are a common problem. Money Without Matrimony offers very sound and comprehensive advice for couples, and I can't recommend it highly enough. I had the opportunity to interview coauthor Debra Neiman on my Internet radio show, EverydayWealth Radio: Your Consumer Advocate, about the book (if you want to listen it's archived online at wsradio.com) and she clearly knows what she is talking about and takes a compassionate approach to what can sometimes be uncomfortable topics to discuss.<br /><br />This is a must-read for unmarried couples, and a great gift if you know someone in that situation.	2005-08-30

Yes it was a light read, which I found a plus -- I have too much to do to read something long or boring!<br /><br />Rita's personal story is quite amazing, and the fact that she has accomplished so much with her life says a lot. I also interviewed Rita about her book on my radio show EverydayWealth Radio: Your Consumer Advocate (you can listen at wsradio.com) and found her to be just as delightful in person as she is in her writing. She gave me a tip that I am putting to use with much success.

I used the Silva method to get a large raise, build my own business, and access information through dreams. You have to try it to believe it!

I was interested in starting a coop, but didn't know how to iron out all the details. Fortunately, I found this book and it answered all my questions. It is very, very thorough and detailed. And it really has some excellent suggestions that one might not think of when starting a coop, like making sure each member has homeowners liability insurance and doing a safety check. If you buy the book, you also get access to a special web site with lots of useful forms to download. You really don't have  to do much work at all. I am advertising my coop now, and am so glad I found this resource.<br />My only problem with the book is that I don't like the secretary method, where you call one person to book the babysitting, and this book really only describes that option. (The book seems to be written for stay-at-home moms, and I am starting a working mom's coop.) But it's thorough enough that I feel I can adapt it for my needs.

I would  recommend this to anyone who would like to increase their brainpower,  connect with higher wisdom and solve problems. As a businessperson, I loved  the part on intution and executive success.  The only reason I didn't give  it five stars was that I think it could have been a little longer (maybe I  just wish it were!) and there were a couple of techniques like the Alpha  Unimold that were touched upon but not really described. Overall, though,  it is a wonderful service and gift to those of us who are fortunate enough  to have it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.	2000-05-30
