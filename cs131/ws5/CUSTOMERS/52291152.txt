He derides the author for describing Fort Pillow as \\"crescent-shaped.\\" The reviewer scornfully claims that the fort was a shallow \\"w\\" in shape.   <br /> <br />If you google the term, \\"Fort Pillow\\" and \\"crescent,\\" guess what pops up? Among other things, a reproduction of Nathan Bedford Forrest's after action report about the capture of Fort Pillow.  Guess what the \\"Wizard of the Saddle\\" describes the fort as being shaped like?  Here's what he said in the report: <br /> <br />\\"The fort is an earth-work, crescent shaped, is 8 feet in height and 4 feet across the top, surrounded by a ditch 6 feet deep and 12 feet in width, walls sloping to the ditch but perpendicular inside.\\" <br /> <br />Personally, I would take the impression of the man who captured the place over any reviewer here.  I wonder what Forrest would have to say to him? (probably something memorably profane). <br /> <br />Now, let's talk about the endpaper map:  I've looked at it too.  First, it isn't that great a map.  If I had been the author, I would have found a better, clearer one.  But it doesn't show barracks or anything else in the Mississippi River! <br /> <br />I'm not saying this book is perfect, but people need to have a sense of proportion.  Does it really matter in a study on the massacre at Fort Pillow whether the author placed a statue of Andrew Jackson in the wrong city?  Getting the description of the fort wrong as the \\"one star\\" reviewer so clearly did is a worse error than something like that.   <br /> <br />The bit about the Army of Tennessee is a legitimate ding, but people ought to think about the odds that in a book that is 530 pages long, anyone could get all of the thousands of facts contained within it correct.   <br /> <br />As far as the idea that the book is some sort of hatchet job on Nathan Bedford Forrest, that is just that reviewer's interpretation.Forrest came up the hard way.  He was a slave trader, and I think one had to be pretty hard-minded to prosper at it the way he did.  He was also a military genius.  But he allowed the massacre at Fort Pillow to take place.  Does that mean he was monster?  No.  It just means that there's a shadow across his reputation --just like the role he played in setting up the KKK after the Civil War.	2005-10-13

He describes the mindset of complacency that seized hold of Israel after its easy victory in the Six Day War.  This \\"konzeptsiya\\" held that the Egyptians and Syrians would not go to war for years to come in the wake of that stinging defeat. It was a logical, coherent, well-thought out mindset ...but it was wrong. <br /> <br />I've read some about the war, but Bar-Joseph's book is full of new revelations: <br /> <br />-the identity of the high-level source who gave the Mossad a definitive warning of Sadat's intent to attack in October 1973 <br /> <br />-the fact that although Israel had obtained the Arabs' tactical battle plans on both the Egyptian and Syrian fronts, the Israeli commanders either did not exploit or were unaware of this hard won knowledge (which reinforces a central belief of mine:  the best intel in the world is useless if people aren't allowed to see it and make use of it) <br /> <br />Perhaps even more important than revelations such as these is Bar-Joseph's discussion of various cognitive and analytic errors that the Israelis fell victim to.  The one that I found most interesting was the proposition that the head of Israeli military intelligence and his favorite analyst both were personalities that favored \\"closure\\" to a dangerous degree (in other words:  they did not like being uncertain and once they had made their minds up, they resisted changing them until almost the very end). <br /> <br />To sum up, this is a wonderful addition to the literature of intelligence books out there.  Given the fact that it happened just three decades ago, it is probably more pertinent and accessible to today's readers than earlier books about Pearl Harbor. <br /> <br />So I congratulate the author and encourage my colleagues in the IC to read this as well as anyone else with an interest in why intelligence failures like the 1973 War happen.	2005-10-10

Anything is better than that.\\" <br /> <br />I don't feel that way after reading \\"Kremlin Rising.\\"  Putin has brought a certain degree of order and stability to Russia after the storm-tossed 1990s.  But it is stability purchased at a very high price.  As the author documents, Putin has deftly extinguished much of the trappings of democracy like an independent and aggressive media and strong regional governments.  \\"Kremlin Rising\\" shows that Putin's Russia is essentially an authoritarian state disguised by a thin veneer of constitutional formalities. <br /> <br />Another price of Putin's Russia is the terrible second war in Chechnya.  Russia has done horrible things there and has paid a ghastly price for doing so.  The butcher's bill of slaughtered school children at Beslan is proof enough of that. <br /> <br />And there's another troubling thing about Putin's War.  That is the possibility that the casus belli, the brutal and random apartment bombings in late 1999 supposedly by the Chechens, may have at least in part been done by Putin's minions.  Now that is disturbing, and I find it even more so given the failure of the international media to press the man who George W. Bush --in an obvious gush of sentimentality brought on by 9/11-- calls \\"Pooty-poot\\" about this very important question. <br /> <br />This being said, \\"Kremlin Rising\\" is not perfect.  I think that given the fact that the book is a ringing indictment of Putin, it would have been appropriate to have a chapter of the good things that Putin has done for Russia. Putin is a bad actor, but he's no Stalin, and it would have been good to have that shown more clearly. <br /> <br />I also don't think the author was fair to Putin on his handling of the theater siege, the one that ended with the Russians pumping knock-out gas that led to many of the rescued hostages dyingneedlessly.  Sure that took the bloom off the triumph for Putin, but the author doesn't seem to realize that even with this collateral damage, it was a far better outcome than Beslan. <br /> <br />But those are minor quibbles.  Read the book and learn --and feel sorry for Russia.	2005-07-19

They don't change their view of the world in response to the facts.  They change the facts to fit their view of the world.\\" <br /> <br />Stalin was the epitome of this principle.  The array of evidence that Soviet intelligence uncovered in the run-up to Barbarossa (the massive 1941 German invasion of Russia) was staggering.  Yet all of this intelligence, purchased with the time and effort and sometimes the blood of Soviet intelligence personnel, might as well have never been collected.  Stalin didn't want to conclude that Hitler was going to attack him in 1941.  Therefore, all evidence pointing to that was provocation. <br /> <br />It's incredible, and speaking as a serving intelligence officer, I find myself wishing that all the people making charges about the politicization of intelligence in the last few years in the US would read Murphy's book and see what real \\"politicization\\" involves. <br /> <br />The only criticisms I have with this book is that I think it would have been appropriate for Murphy to italicize passages of the text which are his suppositions, inferences, and judgments as opposed to absolute facts.  This is routine practice for Intelligence Community products, and it would be useful here. <br /> <br />I also think any student of denial and deception ought to read the appendix of this book which contains letters that Hitler sent to Stalin in the run-up to the attack.  Whoever wrote them for \\"der Fuhrer\\" was truly a master at deception. <br /> <br />Finally, the irony of the situation is profound.  Hitler did to Stalin with Barbarossa what the Allies did to Hitler with Fortitude South (the deception plan that convinced him that D-Day would be at Calais and not Normandy).	2005-07-13

The books out there range from dated treatises to dry academic accounts that would put most readers to sleep.  You'd think that a country as odd as North Korea would get more coverage, particularly because of the nuclear issue and its bellicose behavior.    Jasper Becker's \\"Rogue Regime\\" is like a breath of fresh air in this stale library.  He writes very well and manages to do it in language and terms that people who aren't academics will find accessible and informative.    But the true merit of \\"Rogue Regime\\" is that it fills another gap in the literature about the DPRK.  Becker is not afraid to call Kim Jong-Il and his regime something that is evil.  Most of the literature that has recently appeared shrinks from doing this.  Instead, such books argue about the need to \\"engage\\" with Kim Jong-Il in order to reach \\"a grand bargain\\" with him.    Such books suffer from a central flaw.  They all seem to radiate the belief that if only the US is smart enough, diplomatic enough, or just \\"good enough\\" everything will be sunshine and roses for us in North Korea and other trouble spots in the world.  Such a world view is breathtakingly naive because it refuses to admit that sometimes bad things can happen and evil can exist without having a \\"root cause\\" in the sins of America or the West.  Kim Jong-Il and North Korea constitute such evil in my opinion.    This being said, Becker's book is not perfect.  I think it could have been better sourced in some spots and the hypothetical scenario of a US attack on North Korea at the beginning of the book could have used some editing by someone more familiar with the US military.  But those are minor things.    The bottom line is as Becker argues that there is a moral question we should not ignore when we treat with North Korea.  I commend him for not letting the world forget that.  I also find myself wondering why all the various \\"champions of the world's oppressed\\" like the benighted reviewer who condemned the book as \\"neocon gothick\\" are awol on the North Korean human rights issue.  Maybe they're happier criticizing allies of the US for far lesser sins than what is going on in the DPRK.    ***    Also, I'd like to respond to the allegation by the \\"neocon gothick\\" reviewer that the North Korean famine of the 1990s (aka \\"the Final March to Paradise\\" in regime-speak) was caused partly by the Japanese cut-off of funds from the Korean diaspora there in the 1993-1994.    First, not even the North Koreans blame the Japanese for helping to cause the famine.  They blamed in on crop failures.    Second, even if the Japanese cut off of funds (which was by no means airtight) helped cause the famine, Japan was fully in its rights to block the transfer of money to a country that has consistently been hostile to it (abducting its citizens, violating its laws, etc).      Third, between 1996 and 2000, the US donated over 1.3 million tons of food to North Korea through the World Food Program.  That's kind of strange behavior for a country that according to Mr. \\"Neo-Con Gothick\\" is trying to starve \\"poor little North Korea.\\"	2005-06-23

It really makes you think about how much domestic violence comes down to simple Darwinian competition.      I just find myself wondering about some of the claims made in it:    1.  that as many as 12% of children in middle class families are fathered by men who are engaging in \\"mate poaching\\" (that seems terribly high)    2.  that extramarital affairs for both men and women are motivated by the desire to either pass on genes or have a child with \\"good\\" as opposed to \\"bad\\" genes.  I can't help but think this is really unlikely (that there are many other cues to unfaithful behavior)    3.  that man and woman are more or less slaves to their reproductive instincts.  If this was the case, how does this explain sexual behavior where the production of children is out of the question (oral sex)?    4.  Here's another thought.  If all male behavior boils down to the imperative of passing one's genes to as many women possible and deterring rivals from doing the same to one's \\"own\\" women, what about the phenomenon of males acting as pimps?    5.  Here's yet another thought.  I was really surprised to read that the author considered Diane Downs, the woman who shot her three children --killing one and crippling another-- as fitting the profile of a \\"perfectly normal next-door [neighbor] with no apparent evidence of psychological abnormalities.\\"    If the author had carefully read Ann Rule's book about Downs (\\"Small Sacrifices\\"), he would have seen that Downs was a VERY strange woman and not somebody I would ever describe as the stuff of \\"perfectly normal next-door neighbors.\\"    6.  The author cites the Dorothy Stratten case (the Playboy Playmate who got murdered by her estranged husband back in the 1980s) to illustrate his theory that murder comes down things like the desire to \\"guard one's mate\\" or place her beyond the reach of other men.  I accept the fact that Stratten's murderer apparently thought, \\"If I can't have her, no one will.\\"But what about his deliberate effort to get Stratten to become a playmate and a sexual super-star?  That hardly seems like a smart strategy for a male focused on retaining exclusive control of his woman.    7.  If sowing one's \\"seed\\" far and wide is a good thing (as it is with lower animals in Darwinian terms), why is it that illegitimacy has caused such havoc in lower class economic communities (i.e. female children without male parents tend to have their own illegitimate kids and male children get in trouble and wind up in jail or dead)?    I just think that the author very well may be on to something with this \\"evolutionary\\" approach to murder, but I think that he is calling on his theory to explain far too much.  Murder is a complicated problem, and like most complicated problems, I really doubt that things are quite as simple as the author's theory.	2005-05-23

I am fascinated by North Korea, so when I first spotted this on amazon.com a couple of months ago, I said to myself, \\"Sounds like a Korean War vet went to North Korea on a tour and got to see some interesting things or maybe it's book about the DMZ.  God knows that would be interesting!!\\" <br /> <br />Was I ever wrong.  I think a much better title would be, \\"A Korean War veteran remembers being in Korea and whole bunch of other things not terribly interesting to anyone other than fellow veterans and a few historians.\\" <br /> <br />I don't like being harsh, but most of this book consists of the author's memories of the 1950s and a good deal doesn't even take place in Korea.  As far as the \\"North Korea\\" part goes, I didn't see any references about him actually going into the DPRK.  Going to North Korea is surprisingly not all that hard, since you can apparently step across the line in Panmunjon without getting your head blown off by the KPA guards there. <br /> <br />In short, I'd avoid this book if you're looking for any insights about North Korea or even what it's like to serve in the Republic of Korea today.  I can only hope that someone out there is writing a book about the DMZ.	2005-04-09

So I snapped up a copy of this book when it came out. Thus far, I'm not terribly impressed with it. Why is that? Well, I think that French seems rather biased against the US (if not actually for the DPRK). I'll give three examples:    First, he accuses the US during the 1992-1994 crisis over Yongbyon of \\"extreme belligerence.\\" This really makes me wonder if French bothers to read the stuff put out by the KCNA (Korean Central News Agency, the DPRK's \\"press\\") and by other mouthpieces of the regime. The North Koreans routinely refer to the US as \\"fascists,\\" \\"imperialists,\\" \\"war mongers,\\" etc. Since the crisis resumed in 2002, the regime has put out a line of propaganda posters that show such engaging themes as a Korean People's Army soldier smashing the Capitol dome with a karate chop, a DPRK missile doing the same, and --my personal favorite-- an American soldier impaled on DPRK bayonets. Furthermore, during the 1992-1994 crisis, the DPRK was the country that said any form of sanctions against it would be \\"an act of war.\\" Who's being extremely belligerent here? Granted President Bush did call the DPRK a member of the Axis of Evil, but that's just a pebble compared to the mountain of hateful, vitriolic propaganda that pours out of Pyongyang aimed at the US.    Second, I was disturbed by the way the author characterized an infamous event at Panmunjon in 1976, the so-called \\"Axe Murders.\\"    Essentially what happened was this. One fine day, two American officers led a work party into the DMZ near the truce village to cut some branches from a tree that was blocking their view into the DPRK. They were not armed. A group of KPA guards accosted them and demanded that they stop. Perhaps unwisely, the senior American refused to do so (although he was within his rights to refuse). Whereupon the North Korean commander shouted, \\"Kill the foreigners.\\" This is exactly what the North Koreans did. They beat both of the American officers to death with axe handles and anything else that was handy (photos of this incident are available online).    Mr. French refers to this cold-blooded, supremely brutal, and unprovoked pair of murders as \\"a confrontation\\" that \\"led to the deaths\\" of the two American officers. Using that sort of formulation, one could describe September 11 as \\"a confrontation that led to the deaths of 3,000 American civilians\\" It's a classic example of doing violence to the English language.    Third, there is the incredible excuse the author offers for the North Koreans to violate the spirit (if not the letter of the 1994 Agreed Framework as well as a separate promise to South Korea). This was the decision by the DPRK to embark on a clandestine highly enriched uranium production program some time in the late 1990s. Mr. French attributes this action as the result of North Korean frustration over delays in implementation of components of the Agreed Framework. Supposedly, the North Koreans started the HEU program in order to force the US back to the negotiating table and honor its promises.    That interpretation of facts simply defies common sense. Granted, the North Koreans had some reason to be unhappy with the delays in the delivery of fuel oil and the lagging effort to build the light-water reactors promised to them (although they did get some of what they were promised and might have gotten it all had they played fair with the US). But if all they wanted to do was force the US back to the table, why didn't they simply announce that if the US didn't start talking with them by a certain date, the Agreed Framework would be suspended or ended outright? Why would they embark on the HEU program, which they had no way of knowing the US would discover as the means to force the US back to the table?    Mr. French, it makes no sense. I'll say it again. It makes NO sense. I respectfully suggest to you that the North Koreans became disenchanted with the Agreed Framework, but they continued to play along to extract concessions while trying to pull \\"a fast one\\" on the US and the international community by developing a bomb through the HEU route. In other words, by the late 1990s, they were acting in bad faith.    So the bottom line on \\"the Paranoid Peninsula\\" for me at least is that while it probably has some useful information, I'd treat the analysis with a substantial amount of skepticism.	2005-04-08
US	52291152	RJU79FIXX76F5	076791581X	151450558	The Sociopath Next Door	Books	3	66	91	N	N	contains false information about the military and soldiers	Much of this book is extremely interesting and enlightening, although like other reviewers, I'm skeptical about the numbers of sociopaths that the author claims are roaming society. <br /> <br />My real bone to pick with the author (as someone who served in the military and knows a bit or two about it) are the following: <br /> <br />a.  her statement that anyone who kills someone else in combat would automatically suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, probably for the rest of their lives.  I don't know how she could possibly make such a categorical statement.  Something tells me that most people who have killed in the course of combat do not suffer from PTSD afterwards.  I would imagine the ones who most likely to do have problems either had particularly horrific experiences (i.e. killing someone with a bayonet is a lot different than shooting someone from a 100 yards away) or they had problems that predated combat experience. <br /> <br />b.  her statement that the reason why many soldier in combat don't fire their weapons is because of an innate reluctance to kill.  This is ONE factor among a number of others (such as confusion, not knowing where to shoot, and fear that by shooting one might give away his or her position and get shot himself or herself). <br /> <br />c.  her truly idiotic statement about sociopaths making great special forces operators, snipers, secret agents, etc.  Anyone who has been in the military will tell you that teamwork and trust are cornerstones of soldiering (even for special forces types).  Sociopaths cannot, by definition, be trusted.  Therefore, they are not the type of people who make good soldiers. <br /> <br />Please note:  I am not saying that there aren't any sociopaths in the military.  I know there are (and probably even a few in the special operations community).  I'm just saying that the author's claim is a pretty contemptible error and before she made such a risible claim, she should have at least solicited the opinion of  some soldiers. <br /> <br />Finally, I have to note her claim that September 11 ushered a \\"dark period of aggression\\" in American history.  I would like the author to explain exactly what she means by that statement.  Was attacking al-Qaeda an act emblematic of \\"aggression\\"?  What about Operation Iraqi Freedom?  If that constitutes \\"aggression,\\" what about the uses of military force before September 11(strikes against Iraq, intervention against the Serbs in Bosnia and Kosovo, intervention in Haiti and Somalia, etcetera, etcetera)? <br /> <br />To sum up, it could have been a great book, but it's a bit like a nice new car with a great big dent on one side (the dent being a dent in the author's credibility --at least with me).	2005-03-04

The shootdown of Admiral Yamamoto certainly qualifies as such.

There are over 200 pages of what I would call exposition and background.

Yet I can't get over how the story about Iraq and Al-Qaeda has been (mis)reported, particularly the findings of the September 11 Commission.<br />The commission found that there was no evidence that Saddam was behind September 11.  Yet somehow, this gets abbreviated by the media and the Bush administration's critics to be a finding that there is no evidence whatsoever of an Iraq-Al-Qaeda connection.<br />People will debate about what happened for years.  Yet there is undeniable evidence that there was a pattern of contact between the Iraqis and the Jihadis.  The fact that it had not become a formal operating partnership does not mean that it was not a source of great concern.  Think about it:  How would you feel about the knowledge that a serial aggressor and genocidal ruler like Saddam and a group of religious fanatics were playing footsie with each other?  How would you have felt if the Administration had taken a legalistic approach and decided that no action could be taken because there was no ironclad proof, and then something horrible happened because there was a partnership?<br />Another thing to consider is that Les Hamilton, a Democrat, has criticized the media for hyping the supposed disconnect between the Bush Administration's statements and the findings of the commission.<br />Still another thing is that old saw:  absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  In other words, just because the Iraqi regime figures and Al-Qaeda leaders that are in custody deny that there was an operational partnership doesn't mean that there wasn't.  Maybe it did and maybe it didn't.  We will probably never know for sure.<br />I guess on a final note, I wish someone would give me one example with direct quotes where any Bush Administration figures stated that Saddam was behind 9/11.  So far, all that I've heard is innuendo.<br />As someone who works in the Intelligence Community, I am heartily sick of the politicization of issues that are ofvital national interest by both the Democrats and Republicans.  I wish both parties and their loud-mouthed supporters would stop trying to stick it to each other and figure out what went wrong and what is needed to make sure that it never happens again.	2004-06-18

Hasso Von Manteuffel did not command the &quot;Fifth Panzer Division.&quot;  He was the commander of the &quot;Fifth Panzer Army.&quot;<br />3.  General Patton did not rescue the &quot;First Airborne Division at Bastogne.&quot;  He relieved the &quot;101st Airborne Division.&quot;  This error is particularly surprising since the author makes a correct reference to that fact on the same page.<br />Now, I want to close with a few words about revisionist reviews like the one that I've seen here which gave the book one star.<br />The Germans and Japanese (with Italy in a supporting role) started a war of unprecedented viciousness which killed tens of millions of people.  As the author points out, it is laughable for revisionists to condemn the Allies for fighting back with everything at their disposal.  Some of the things that were done to Germany and Japan were wrong or excessive and caused considerable loss of innocent life.  Yet they shrink into relative insignificance compared to the deliberate, &quot;stare in your victims' faces when you kill them&quot; genocide that the Germans and Japanese perpetrated.<br />This being said, I weep for the people incinerated in Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg, Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and many other places.  However, I feel much more pity for the entirely innocent victims of Auschwitz, Belsen, Treblinka, Nanking, and scores of other places where Germans and Japanese dishonored their nations by stooping into previously uncharted depths of evil.<br />No one deserves the terrible fates that many German and Japanese cities endured.  The deaths of individual Germans and Japanese are tragedies.  But on a grand scale, what happened to those two countries is a classic example of sowing the seeds and reaping a whirlwind of destruction.  After what those two nations did to the rest of the world, they had it coming.<br />So I don't regard Dresden as a sin or mistake.  It was one of terrible necessities of war, which advances in technology have made obsolete.	2004-02-18

Yet my search for worthwhile books to read  about that sad little country has not turned up very much.  The literature seems to be divided up into ideological rants about how the Bush administration provoked the new crisis (given the fact that the North Koreans began cheating before Bush was president that makes no sense) or impenetrably dense academic tomes (I noticed a reviewer of Breen's other book sneering at the fact that it is a &quot;popular&quot; book).<br />In my view, I learned a great deal about Kim Jong-Il and the state that he runs by reading Breen's book.  I thought the chapters on the North Korean slave labor camps and the one titled &quot;Country of the Lie&quot; were particularly enlightening.  I'm starting to perceive North Korea as less a country than a cult and the typical North Koreans as the equivalent of abused children who persist in believing that the &quot;Dear Leader&quot; loves them, even as he lets them starve.  <br />This being said the book is not perfect:<br />1.  It could have been longer.  It was only about 190 pages.  I would have liked more information about the nuclear crisis and North Korea's arms and drug dealing enterprises.<br />2.  The chapter &quot;Is Kim Jong-Il Evil?&quot; wavers from being highly perceptive to being annoyingly &quot;new age-ish.&quot;<br />3.  The author makes a few minor errors (understating a number or two by several orders of magnitude and stating that the average North Korean's weight is 16 kilograms -34 pounds which is impossible).<br />Still, I feel that I am far better informed having read this book.  I believe it deserves a five star rating even with its faults because it fills such a yawning gap in public understanding of this strange little man and his strange little country.<br />Read it and learn!	2004-01-30

Reading it, I could only think of how many stupid things are done in the name of honor and manhood.<br />I disagree with the negative comments about this book.  I don't think the author is a &quot;hack,&quot; and I don't think that she spares the readers descriptions about how unpleasant it is to get stabbed or shot.  Pushkin's death from being gut shot in his last duel is a particularly vivid image that she describes.<br />I also think that people should not read it expecting a deep discussion about swordplay and gunslinging.  The book is meant to be amusing and informative, and it certainly is.<br />The only criticism that I have against &quot;Gentlemen's Blood&quot; is that the author's thesis that modern day warfare is just dueling writ large is idiotic.  In the past, some wars --particularly those of absolute rulers-- had features of duels, however, I would submit that an event like World War II or Vietnam is nothing like a duel.	2003-12-14
US	52291152	R3DK6VUKEXY68Q	1591840082	853464652	Smartest Guys in the Room: The Amazing Rise and Scandalous Fall of Enron	Books	4	9	11	N	N	Very Good Account of an Incredibly Complex Story	Over the last two years, I've been looking for a book that explains the Enron saga in terms that I can understand.  &quot;The Smartest Guys&quot; comes closest to doing this.  It is written in an informal style but not one that &quot;talks down&quot; to the reader.  It is not some &quot;insider, tell all&quot; book but one that takes a global perspective.  The narrative takes the reader from the boardrooms in Houston to eastern India.<br />This being said, it's not a perfect book.  One thing I have to criticize is the lack of any endnotes, footnotes, chapter notes, or bibliography.  With a saga as twisted as Enron's, you'd think it would be mandatory.  Another flaw is the fact that although the authors did their best, some of the &quot;special purpose entities&quot; and financial escapades of Chief Financial Officer Fastow left me scratching my head in bewilderment.  I could see the big picture:  corporate debt was being laundered and &quot;magically&quot; transformed into earnings and profits but I felt a bit like I was watching a particularly skilled magician execute his tricks (the hand is quicker than the eye).<br />Nevertheless, I know a lot more about Enron than I did before.  I think anyone who wants to know why the company rose to such dizzying heights before crashing should read it.<br />For those who aren't interested in that, here is my quicky explanation.  It was a combination of:<br />arrogance - from the leadership to the foot soldiers<br />corruption - personifed by Andrew Fastow but another pervasive problem<br />lack of oversight - by Arthur Andersen and the banks that &quot;enabled&quot; Enron for far too long as well as the government<br />wishful thinking - Enron's belief that it could do anything and the stock analysts who bought that argument<br />That's it in a nutshell.  The bottom line is that like most major disasters there is no single cause.  It was a systemic failure.  Fastow, Lay, and Skilling wouldn't have been able to do the damage that they did without countless &quot;accomplices.&quot;	2003-10-15

This book is probably the best that I've read.  Only Peter Bergen's \\"Holy War Inc\\" approaches it in quality.  In a comparison of Burke and Bergen's books, I would say the former is more up-to-date and with more analysis; the latter is slightly more readable.  In total, I would give Burke's book the edge simply by reason of it being newer:<br />The Very Good:<br />1.  The chapters explaining the al-Qaeda viewpoint are excellent.<br />2.  The details about the Cole plot and the Millenium conspiracy are very good.<br />3.  The analogy of the hard-core al-Qaeda being a \\"venture capital firm\\" of terrorism (or a library or newspaper) is quite apt and very interesting.<br />The Not So Good:<br />1.  The book rambles in a couple of spots.<br />2.  The author does not provide any concrete road map for combating the al-Qaeda \\"ideology.\\"<br />**************************<br />Another thing I would like to comment on is the fact that both Clarke and Bergen's books pass a number of tests for me about whether they are worth reading (I suggest readers apply them when considering buying future books on this topic):<br />1.  They don't blame the US or the West for the problem.  This is a very annoying characteristic of a lot of writing about Bin Laden.  Some people out there just refuse to accept that sometimes people do very bad things for no good reasons at all.<br />2.  They don't say that our problems with Bin Laden will disappear if we are more even-handed in dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian dispute.<br />3.  They don't propose or even waste time by considering idiotic conspiracy theories such as the idea that Bin Laden was behind Oklahoma City, TWA 800, and other unconnected tragedies and terrorist events.<br />So read this book and learn something!	2003-09-28

I thought it was quite good, although I thought the section on Chechnya rambled slightly.<br />As far as this book being an example of too much bad news, my response is this is Russia, for God's sake.  There is no shortage of bad news there.  How could you write an upbeat book about Chechnya, the history of the Gulag, Sakhalin Island (the section about that actually does have some &quot;good&quot; news), or the mafia state that has emerged in post-Soviet Russia?<br />Face it.  You can't.  As for this book's merits, all I can say is that reading it made me far more informed about current affairs in Russia (something my Russia tour guides remarked about frequently).<br />If you want &quot;cheerful,&quot; don't read books about countries with these kinds of problems.	2003-09-28

This was the one where the supposedly benevolent pigs who were in charge of the farm sat down with the humans, but when the other animals looked in, they could not tell the difference between them all.<br />In other words, I'm beginning to think that the Russians traded one system of oppression for another when they rallied behind Boris Yeltsin in August 1991.  That is the impression that I get from reading \\"Darkness at Dawn.\\"  I have an undergraduate degree in Russian and Soviet Studies, so I knew that the Russians had a huge problem with mafias and corruption, but I had no idea that it was bad as the picture painted by the author here.<br />Satter tells us how bad and mobbed up the \\"new\\" Russia is with a series of anecdotes, from the tragic and avoidable deaths of the crew of the Kursk to the appalling deaths of ordinary Muscovites unlucky enough to fall into sinkholes full of scalding hot water created by defective pipes that burst.<br />But for me, the most disturbing story is the allegation that it was not the Chechens who were behind the series of apartment house bombings that happened in 1999, which provided the Russian government with a justification for attacking Chechnya.  Satter presents evidence that suggests that it might just have been the Russian government itself that did this, in order to distract the people and more or less make Vladimir Putin's ascension to power irrevocable.<br />I pride myself on being profoundly skeptical of conspiracy theories.  But knowing what I know about the corrupt system of government in Russia (something discussed in Handelman's \\"Comrade Criminal\\" as well), I find myself really wondering.  I really, really do.	2003-06-10

The author writes fairly vividly.  The book has good maps.<br />However, there are a number of problems with the book:<br />1.  It's not very well-sourced.  There are hardly any footnotes (just very limited \\"chapter notes\\" in the back)<br />2.  The author gets it wrong about a widely known fact.  Hitler did not \\"dance a jig\\" at Versailles.  He stamped his foot and the British did a film loop of that.<br />3.  Another basic error is when the author says the SS grew into a force of several divisions.  The SS eventually comprised 38 divisions which is a lot more than several.<br />4.  The author raises the possibility that British soldiers massacred members of the SS after a battle.  There is no specific sourcing for that (see #1).<br />5.  The narrative gets a little confusing near the end (the maps).<br />6.  The author doesn't present an accurate number of the French evacuated at Dunkirk (he states a number that is exceeded by the number he mentioned as being evacuated in a single day).<br />Bottom line:  Worthwhile to read but the sloppiness makes it impossible to give it 4 or 5 stars.	2003-03-26
US	52291152	R9IY1IV5U6HW4	1586481045	293409666	More Terrible than Death: Massacres, Drugs, and America's War in Colombia	Books	4	15	20	N	N	An impressive book	Normally, I don't have too much time for human rights workers like the author.  I recognize that they perform a perhaps vital service for society.  Yet when I hear one try to equate something horrific like a massacre in Colombia to the very limited number of legal executions in the United States, I mentally tune them out.<br />Thankfully, Ms. Kirk does not engage in this type of moral equivalency game.  She focuses on the situation in Colombia and the horrific violence that has wracked that country for over fifty years.  By doing so, she adds to the shamefully small amount of English-language literature about drug trafficking and its interlinkage with marxist guerrillas and right-wing death squads in Colombia.  Given the fact that Colombia each year produces and exports hundreds of metric tons of cocaine and heroin to the United States and the fact that those drugs have caused thousands of murders here and elsewhere over the last twenty years, you'd think that Colombia would also be a charter member of the axis of evil.  I don't mean the government in Bogota, but the people who are directly and indirectly involved in the drug trade there.  Yet for some reason it is not.  <br />Anyway, I think the book gives a very good run-down about the major players in the Colombian tragedy:  the FARC, the ELN, the AUC, the army etc.  Kirk writes well and at times even beautifully (however, one or two attempts at poetic description fall flat).  I do think that she is a little too sympathetic to the leader of the FARC.  In my opinion, he may have been a good guy once, but that was many a massacre and drug deal ago.<br />Finally, I think that Kirk states something very true about Colombia and the United States in the beginning of her book.  Yes, Colombia's wars would probably still rage at some level without drug money flowing into the coffers of the combatants.  Yet the billions of dollars some of the United States' population insist on spending on illegal drugs has supercharged the civil strife in Colombia.  To paraphrase Kirk, our pleasures pull Colombia under.	2003-01-24

After all, it is a dramatic telling of the cataclysmic explosion in Texas City in 1947.  <br />Yet if you are a fussy reader like me, something is going to bother you about the narrative.  It's very simple.  In the case of at least one of the major figures of the book, Father Bill Roach, the author puts words in his mouth; tells us what he is thinking; and frequently informs us in detail of his routine actions.  This is despite the fact that Father Roach died in the explosion, and unless the author knows the secret of time travel or can speak with the dead, this means there is a large amount of fiction in the book.<br />To me, this wrecks the credibility of the narrative.  The enormous amount of research Mr. Minutaglio did almost becomes moot.  He doesn't even give us footnotes, endnotes, or chapter notes, so we can pick out what amounts to pure speculation on his part and ignore it.<br />His only sop to the readers is italicizing some passages.  These he coyly describes as &quot;external and internal dialogue&quot; that he &quot;built&quot; from what is known as fact. In the end, I find myself wondering why he didn't just stick to the facts like most other writers of non-fiction do or simply write a novel about the explosion.  He writes very well, and I bet such a book would have sold.	2003-01-16

What sets Wise's account apart from its predecessors?  The answer is diligent, long-term research and unparalleled access to people who knew Hanssen.  The fact that the traitor gave his psychiatrist permission to be interviewed by Wise gives readers a window into Hanssen's soul that none of his competitors (who rushed their books to publication with almost indecent haste) were able to give.  An added plus to Wise's book is that he gives a fairly comprehensive outline of the research he conducted for the book in his notes at the end.  This is in stark contrast to his competitors' books which rest their flimsy conclusions on mostly anonymous sources and in the case of \\"Into the Mirror\\" the outright --and admitted by its authors-- fictionalization of Hanssen's life whenever it was convenient.<br />For me, the highlights of \\"Spy\\" are the chapters that discuss Hanssen's approach to religion, his twisted obsession with pornography and sex, the way the FBI and CIA procurred the entire file that the KGB maintained on Hanssen, and the psychological demons that drove Hanssen to inflict horrific damage on his country's national security.  What is particularly shocking is that Hanssen's own brother-in-law (a fellow FBI agent) reported the spy's possession of large amounts of unexplained cash in 1990 to his superiors and the FBI brass did NOTHING about it.  Hanssen could have been caught that year had someone in the FBI bureaucracy cared enough to follow through on the tip-off that they were handed on a silver platter.  Even more disturbing is the allegation in the book that Hanssenwanted to have his best friend father a child by his wife so they could be a family of three.  To paraphrase Wise, trying to understand someone who thinks and behaves the way Hanssen did is like taking a trip to the dark side of the moon.<br />To sum up, I would ignore all the other books about Hanssen and buy Wise's book.  Reading it will make you want to cry not just because of what Hanssen did to all of us but because the FBI allowed him to inflict immeasurable harm on his country for so many years.	2002-10-26

I did not have much luck.  There were few books about that troubled country on bookstore shelves and the ones that were tended to be dry academic bits of prose.<br />That's why Owen's book is such a valuable and timely addition to the limited collection of books about Pakistan.  The author spent two years there as a BBC journalist and was witness to some of the crucial events in that country's recent history.  He also had access to many of the key players who make Pakistan tick.<br />But it's the writing style that wins me over the most.  Owens does not write like an academic, but he doesn't give us a boring travelogue filled with hard to visualize first person impressions.  Instead, you could argue that his book is written as a primer for people who don't know much about Pakistan.  In just under three hundred pages of lively writing, he surveys all the major problems and issues facing that country.  Kashmir, the atomic bomb, the 1999 coup, the role of the army in Pakistani society, it's all covered.<br />My only criticism is this:  at one point the author implies that the Taliban was one of the mujahideen groups that fought the Russians.  That is certainly not correct.  The Taliban movement only formed after the Russians left Afghanistan.  It had fighters from that conflict in its ranks, but the organization did not fight in the Soviet-Afghan war.  A small error, but I am surprised that Ahmed Rashid, the author of a very good book about the Taliban and someone who endoresed Owen's book, did not catch and correct.  So, if I could I probably would have rated this book 4.5 stars.  Oh, well.	2002-10-04

I'll preface my mini-review here with the following statement:  Had anyone told me a year ago that I would read --in one day-- a romance about lives and loves of successive generations of women blessed or cursed with witchy powers, I would have laughed at them.  A few years back, I tried to watch the movie &quot;Practical Magic&quot; and found myself thoroughly bored by what I considered a talky &quot;chick flick.&quot;  Since then, I've become a fan of Sandra Bullock and recently saw the film again, and found myself liking it for the most part.  I particularly loved the sad, wistful character played by Bullock, that of Sally Owens.<br />So I checked the book out from the library, not knowing what to expect, and like a man in the story who becomes enchanted by a letter Sally writes that comes into his possession, &quot;Practical Magic&quot; hooked me.  Hoffman writes with such easy, beautiful prose and the characters really spring to life and find a place in your heart and imagination.<br />I won't regurgitate the plot here.  But I will say that Hoffman writes so well about perhaps the most exquisite and maybe the rarest kind of love, the type that hits both a man and a woman like a thunderbolt, overpowering and sweeping them both away.  Hoffman's descriptions of this happening to Sally and her sister and the two men that they are destined to be with packs a tremendous and very satisfying emotional punch for any romantic, which I guess I am.  Oh, how I found myself envying the lucky men who won the hearts of Sally and Gillian!  To feel love as strong as that and be loved as fiercely in return must be the best thing in the world.<br />So read the book and like Sally Owens would say, fall in love whenever you can.	2002-10-01

But it's not a perfect read.  Since the good outweighs the bad in it, I'll start with that:<br />1.  Easy to read but you never get the feeling that you're being talked down to by the author.<br />2.  Very insightful about Tony Soprano's personality, his prognonis, relationship with Melfi, and his wife.<br />3.  Made me appreciate just how complex the Sopranos is as a TV show (lightyears ahead of most of the other TV out there).<br />Now the bad . . .<br />1. Author would have been well-advised to get a Sopranos' fanatic to proofread his book  --to get rid of the number of minor mistakes he makes when recounting the plot.<br />2.  Author seems to regard all killing as equally immoral (As a former military man, I found that quite offensive  --sometimes you don't have any choice but to fight).<br />3.  Author sometimes over-psychoanalyzes the show (I for one do not believe that men join the Mafia because it allows them to escape into an alternate \\"family\\" without overbearing maternal presences!).<br />Still, I think it is a good book.  That being said, it's a little slim for a hardback.  Adding a chapter which deconstructs whatever episode the author considers to be the most psychologically complex would add some heft to it.	2002-08-11

I would put the story in the same category of thrillers such as &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot; and &quot;The Eagle Has Landed.&quot;  It shares the same qualities as those books.  It is a suspenseful story grounded in reality with real people as opposed to supermen or superwomen as the protagonist.<br />I would only caution that this book is not &quot;quick read.&quot;  If you want to understand the cryptanalysis as well as the espionage, reading at a deliberate, thoughtful pace is well-advised.  I hope that Harris does a sequel involving the two major characters who were the protagonists of the story.  I can't wait for the movie to be released on DVD!	2002-06-26
US	52291152	RQENHDXKB4NOH	0231126921	839711556	Inside Al Qaeda: Global Network of Terror	Books	3	9	13	N	N	Promptly Returned It  (slightly revised)	I bought this book with high hopes. I thought it might join the very small library of books that are authoritative accounts of Osama Bin Laden and Al-Qaeda which aren't tainted with conspiracy theories.<br />I credit the author for not producing a book that blames Al-Qaeda for the accidental crash of TWA 800 and does not link Terry Nichols with Ramzi Yousef to \\"prove\\" a hidden hand behind the Oklahoma City Bombing.<br />What I have to fault him and his editors for are errors that rise above the category of \\"typos.\\" I encountered two in reading just ten pages and for me that was enough to conclude that \\"Inside Al-Qaeda\\" desperately needs a heavy editing job that it will hopefully receive in later editions. Perhaps then it can truly claim to be an in-depth analysis of the world's most dangerous terrorist organization:<br />Error Number 1: The author confuses \\"ulema\\" (Islamic scholars) with \\"ummah\\" (the community of believers).<br />Error Number 2: The author refers to twenty hijackers going to their deaths on September 11. Excuse me? I think there have been about a million news stories that state there were 19 hijackers on September 11. I'd like to think that if this book had received a serious edit, such an incredibly glaring error would have stuck out like a neon sign. If I were a teacher grading the author's book like an academic paper, I'd mark him down half a grade for making a mistake like that.<br />{I'd also like to briefly respond to the argument that a close reading of the book would have revealed that the author was including Zacharias Moussaoui when he referred to the \\"twenty\\" hijackers.  That cannot be correct.  On page 7 of the book, the author categorically states that twenty hijackers went willingly to their deaths.  Moussaoui is very much alive. So he could not have been one of the \\"twenty\\" men who died.}  <br />There are some people who will probably disagree with me about this book. They may very well consider it to be very well written. But given the prices we pay these days for books, I think we readers deserve ones prepared with great care and mistakes like the ones I've cited above put \\"Inside Al-Qaeda\\" outside that category.<br />(note:  In 2003, a paperback edition came out.  I was sorry to see that the author and the publishers had still not corrected the \\"twenty\\" hijackers mistake.  One is left with the impression that they just did not care about that basic error and that is another indictment of this book.)	2002-06-20

The story of how John Orr was brought to justice is intriguing and gripping, without wallowing in grisly details.<br />I do have to deduct a star from my review for two reasons:<br />1.  Just as he berates the lawyers trying the case for subjecting the juries to too much detail, the author overdoes it himself on occasion.<br />2.  As a related point, some of the evidence Wambaugh cites would have been much easier to understand with some pictures, diagrams, and timelines.  Yet these, as in his other true crime stories, are absent.	2002-05-04
US	52291152	R39W8234JT232A	0671025309	402965811	A Line in the Sand	Books	5	9	9	N	N	One of Seymour's Best	I didn't expect to like this book.  I had read and tremendously enjoyed what some call Seymour's Northern Ireland trilogy (Harry's Game, Field of Blood, and the Journeyman Tailor), but I hadn't liked another effort, Kingfisher.<br />But while I eagerly continue to wait for another Seymour thriller centered in Northern Ireland, I decided to read his book Untouchable, which while not perfect, had me in its grip from the first to last page.<br />So I decided to give Seymour another whirl, and I picked out A Line in the Sand.  After reading it in about two days, I have to say the analogy one reviewer made of Seymour's plots coiling around a reader like a boa constrictor as the tension builds to an unbearable level is well put.  The book is very hard to put down, and really doesn't have any flaws (apart from a couple of minor facts not worth mentioning here).<br />Furthermore, like in his other books Seymour doesn't just write a thriller, he presents the reader with an ethical question.  \\"What would you do if you found out your neighbor was marked for death by a state sponsor of terror like Iran?  Would you rally to his side, stand aloof, or try to drive him out of your pretty little village?\\"<br />As for myself, I'd like to think that I'd continue to be a friend and neighbor, but suggest that my good friend the terrorist target take a long vacation until the threat subsided.<br />Bottom Line:  A superb read, it is reportedly being made into a movie even as I write this.  I look forward to seeing that . . .<br />. . . But I hope with all my heart that with his next book (titled Meaning No Evil) Seymour returns to his familiar stomping grounds of Northern Ireland and with all the wonderful characters that he created there:  Inspector Rennie, Cathy Parker, Gary Brennard, and of course, Frankie, the IRA man.	2002-02-18
US	52291152	R38NNHTR5QJOM9	0316718211	17679506	The Spy Next Door: The Extraordinary Secret Life of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Damaging FBI Agent in U.S. History	Books	1	37	43	N	N	Another Rush Job and It Shows!	I've been fascinated by the Hanssen spy case since it came to light early last year.  Yet it amazes me that three books about Hanssen have already surfaced:  this one, Vise's &quot;The Bureau and the Mole,&quot; and Havill's &quot;The Spy Who Stayed Out in the Cold.&quot;  To be blunt, all three are &quot;quicky paperback books&quot; dressed up as serious hardbacks.  Anybody who wants to know the whole truth or anything near it is going to have to wait for years for it to come out.  <br />This fact is painfully evident in Shannon and Blackman's book.  There are several flaws to it that are evident with just a quick scan (I'm still reading it):<br />1.  Omission:  In Vise's equally poor quality book, he states a very important fact, that Hanssen's brother-in-law, a fellow FBI agent, reported him in 1990 as a person living well beyond his means.  That is a red-flag indicator that someone in a sensitive job like an FBI counterintelligence specialist (as Hanssen was) may have gone wrong.  Incredibly, according to Vise, the FBI did nothing with this tip.  Yet a search of the text and index of Shannon and Blackman's book makes no mention of this incident or even the name of the FBI agent who reported him (maybe I missed it, or the authors discounted it, but it should have been mentioned!).<br />2.  Sourcing:  Just like Vise, the authors don't deign to detail the &quot;extensive research&quot; that they conducted in the few short months since Hanssen's arrest.  Instead, they expect us to take it for granted that their research was great without giving us the bibliography and endnotes that let us test that assumption.  I'll give an example.  On page 80, Shannon and Blackman state the following about Hanssen's personality:<br />&quot;He didn't know what [his fellow FBI agents] spoke about when out at the bars and strip clubs, but maybe it was about him --maybe that was all they ever talked about.  Hanssen had spent his life pressing his face up against the glass . . . more than anything he wanted power --real power, which to [Hanssen] meant the power to humiliate others.&quot;<br />Now, how do Shannon and Blackman know this?  They didn't interview Hanssen (he hasn't even been sentenced yet!!).  Are they mind-readers?  Somehow, I suspect that this passage is the opinion of a psychiatrist (one of those that they interviewed).  What's the harm in saying that in a footnote??<br />This is surprising to me because Shannon is capable of superb research (I don't know anything about Blackman). I have read her book about the 1985 murder of a DEA agent in Mexico.  She took well over two years to write it and included 15 pages of endnotes.  Yet the diligence shown in that book is absent in &quot;The Spy Next Door.&quot;<br />3. Style of Research:  In their very brief description of sources, the authors state that they made &quot;dozens of written requests&quot; for help from Hanssen's wife, his family, and Mrs. Hanssen's attorney.  I'm sorry, but I think that &quot;dozens of written requests&quot; constitute pestering people and is not worthy of journalists of Shannon and Blackman's apparent caliber.  After the first few rejections, this duo should have taken the hint and moved on.<br />I close this review out with the fervent hope that Peter Earley is working on a book about this case.  He did the definitive one on Aldrich Ames (arrested in 1994 but the book only came out in 1997).  Earley got Ames' cooperation, those of his colleagues, and incredibly some of his Russian handlers.  Furthermore, he gives a precise account of his sources by chapter and a bibliography (both of which are sadly lacking in &quot;The Spy Next Door&quot;).<br />To sum up, I'm sorry I bought this book but glad that I at least got it at a steep discount.  I wouldn't recommend that anyone shell out the bucks to buy a brand new hardback copy.  They should wait a year or two and get the paperback on the remainder shelves.	2002-01-04
US	52291152	RWYU26W1CQ3OC	0312261268	439196912	The Key to My Neighbor's House: Seeking Justice in Bosnia and Rwanda	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Moving Account	I've read two books about Rwanda and served with the US contingent to the United Nations Protection Force that operated in the former Yugoslavia in the early-to-mid 1990s.  Therefore, I am fairly well acquainted with the savagery that the author recounts with great empathy for the victims.  I can still remember the day that I walked into my unit headquarters one April morning in 1994 and saw on CNN a Hutu hacking a Tutsi to death with a machete.  Pre-occupied as I was on Bosnia and Croatia, it took years for me to realize that what happened in Rwanda makes just about everything except the Holocaust pale in comparison.<br />Anyway, I commend the author for writing a book that discusses the quest for justice and retribution against the legion of killers in the Balkans and Rwanda.  I think that she writes with balance (as illustrated by her highlighting the case of two Bosnian Serbs who suffered greatly at hands of &quot;Muslims&quot; in a concentration camp that the Izetbegovic government established or at least tolerated).<br />My only complaint is that the author just about ignores the Croats, both as victims and victimizers.  As one who toured the Krajina region of Croatia (where the Serbs used to be the dominant ethnic group), I saw the signs of ethnic cleansing everywhere, blown up houses, churches, and shops all belonging to Croats.  I also know about the vicious war that the Bosnian Croats and Muslims fought in 1993.  During that little conflict, the Croats showed that they could be bastards just as much as the Serbs were.<br />Finally, I found a couple of passages exceedingly grisly.  I would not recommend reading the part of the book that discusses the exhumation of mass graves around Srebrenica if you have a weak stomach or a low tolerance for horror.  But I wouldn't say that the gruesome descriptions are a flaw in the book, just an awful reminder of the hell that war can be and usually is.	2001-12-26
US	52291152	R1GF8VO5P4WB5A	0871138344	570501457	The Bureau and the Mole: The Unmasking of Robert Philip Hanssen, the Most Dangerous Double Agent in FBI History	Books	1	65	80	N	N	I wish I hadn't bought it.  It's a rush job and it shows.	I think that the espionage case of Robert Hanssen is one of the most fascinating to have ever taken place.  I eagerly awaited the publication of &quot;The Bureau and the Mole.&quot;  Yet despite the fact that the book does add some details about how twisted Hanssen was, I am very disappointed with it for five reasons:<br />1.  It is very short for such an interesting case.  It weighs in at 223 pages (setting aside several lengthy appendixes --the inclusion of one I will discuss below).  Yet of these 223 pages more than 60 deal with the life and times of Louis Freeh, the former Director of the FBI.  I fail to see why the author put what amounts to a miniature biography of someone who had very little to do with Hanssen's life until Hanssen was identified as being a traitor.  If you subtract the Freeh material, you're left with a book about Hanssen that is less than 170 pages long.  That is way too short for such a long-term and complex case.<br />2.  So far (I am still reading it), I found one factual error in the book which points to a rush job.  On page 73, the author states &quot;The Bureau also arrested Edward R. Howard, on charges of selling a litancy of secrets to the Soviet Union.&quot;  I read an excellent book about &quot;Edward Lee Howard&quot; called &quot;The Spy Who Got Away.&quot;  If memory serves, Howard never was arrested by the FBI.  He was under its surveillance but managed to escape and flee to Moscow.<br />3.  The book is peppered with statements that indicate a knowledge by the author of what Hanssen felt about this or that. Now, I know that the author consulted psychiatrists and psychologists to try to puzzle out Hanssen's complex personality, and he probably used their insights to make these statements.  But he doesn't say that. Instead, one is left with the impression that Hanssen talked to the author (which he apparently did not) or that David Vise is some kind of mind-reader (see comment 4)<br />4.  The author boasts of his extensive research.  Yet instead of specifying it with footnotes and a bibliography, he just summarizes his souce material in a few pages.  Personally, I am a big believer in documentation even if you have to say a source for a particular fact is from an &quot;anonymous FBI agent.&quot;<br />5.  The author morally was dead wrong to include as an appendix to the book reproductions of the sexual fantasies that Robert Hanssen posted about his wife on the Internet.  I fail to see how this adds to the story of Robert Hanssen and believe it can only hurt the innocent members of his family, specifically his wife.  The fact that Hanssen was posting such stories on the Internet is certainly germane to his own story, but we readers do not need to read the full, sordid material to get an impression of what a twisted, hypocritical character Hanssen was.  The author could have summarized the postings by including a few excerpts in the text.  In my opinion, Bonnie Hanssen (Hanssen's wife and a person who strikes me as being in denial because of her decision to stick with her husband) has every right to hate the author for putting this sexually explicit material --which I refuse to read-- in the book.<br />To sum up, I think we still are waiting for the definitive book on Hanssen and that may take some time to materialize.  Unless you are a true espionage buff, I would stay away from this book.	2001-12-19

C'mon!  it's a matter of public record that the agent in question is Lon Horiuchi (by the way, I believe that Weaver and the FBI share equal blame for what happened up there and that Horiuchi does not deserve to be punished if his superiors aren't).<br />6.  book suffers from lack of pictures and diagrams (would have helped to explain Ruby Ridge and Waco better).<br />7.

This book is an excellent overview of how Afghanistan became a cesspool of drug trafficking, militant Islam, and terrorism.  Reading it leaves me with a sense of anger that the world allowed the situation there to degenerate to the point where the United States is now engaged in a war in Afghanistan against a Saudi megalomaniac who thinks he's a modern day version of Saladin (note:  the real Saladin displayed chivalry to his enemies but not Usama Bin Laden).  <br />I say this book is worth reading again because the situation in Afghanistan and the Central Asian region is so complex, so bewildering that despite the author's extremely lucid and &quot;reader friendly&quot; prose, it is difficult to grasp all at once.  I commend him for producing such a magnificent book.	2001-11-02

The author jams in a great deal of material that would better belong in footnotes and his exposition scenes seem to go on forever. Then there is just material that doesn't belong in a book titled &quot;Twelve Days of Terror&quot; at all.  Do we really care to hear anecdotes about the author's attempts to find the gravestones of the victims or how one potential interview subject kicked off (i.e. died of old age) before he could get to her house?  I sure don't.  <br />Don't get me wrong.  The book's sections that deal with &quot;sea tigers&quot; are fascinating.  I, for one, did not know that dolphins are afraid to tangle with bull sharks and that seals will sometimes leap into a fisherman's boat in a desperate effort to evade being eaten by the predators of the deep.  That stuff is interesting and germane.  But going on endlessly about the history of some small town in New Jersey is definitely not.<br />I think I should have bought &quot;Close to Shore.&quot;	2001-05-31

Perhaps the most impressive thing about the tale is that it had such a happy ending.  I, for one, cannot imagine enduring what the prisoners in this story had to endure.  As a former military officer, I cannot imagine the luck and courage of the Rangers who rescued them.<br />However, this is not a book I would recommend for the squeamish or the very young reader.  Some of the crimes committed by the Japanese on the &quot;Death March&quot; and at the POW camps are quite grisly and linger in the memory.<br />Nevertheless, a great book!	2001-05-27

I agree with the previous reviewers' comments that the book is judgmental (sometimes on peripheral issues).  However, &quot;judgmental&quot; is not always a dirty word.  The bottom line is that we failed to destroy the Republican Guard.  Failing to do so made Saddam's survival much less problematic (see &quot;Out of the Ashes&quot; by the Cockburns for a good account of Hussein's astonishing resilience.<br />I also thought the argument about the battle of Khafji was intriguing.  I didn't think it at the time, but our victory there should have told us we would roll over the Iraqis and that VII Corps' plans for a long campaign were unrealistic.<br />But as they say...<br />the saddest words of tongue or pen, are the words 'it might have been.'	2001-01-24

I believe that Wolf Blitzer deserves a great deal of praise both for his writing style and the quality of his research.<br />Bottom Line:  Pollard was a venal, mixed up person who cheerfully betrayed his country for money.  My impression from reading a recent Seymour Hersh article about Pollard is that the &quot;I did it for Israel&quot; excuse is a convenient afterthought.  He should stay in jail...<br />But if it is necessary to release him in order to cajole some future Israeli government into a peace accord with the Palestinians, I could live with that.  We should just revoke his citizenship before letting him make &quot;aliyah&quot; (emigration) to Israel.  Personally, I'd like to see him sent there via a giant slingshot (like the way Dilbert gets periodically sent to Elbonia).	2000-10-19

Seeing faces tends to bring things to life.<br />2.  confusing -- There are hundreds of crimes and characters in the narrative.  As a result, it got very confusing at times.  I think the author should have thrown in some of the diagrams of the gangs and how they interacted with each other (like the way the prosecution explained things to the jury at the trial).<br />3.  a bit wordy -- I think the author could have trimmed twenty pages from his narrative by weeding out overly long biographical sketches of peripheral players and by eliminating the office politics story.<br />4.  dubious triumph -- I guess the elimination of the Wild Cowboys (aka &quot;Red Top&quot;) is a definite triumph.  A bunch of killers were locked up.  Crime in the area they operated in has gone down.  But I feel a little queasy over the fact that two of the gang's leaders were allowed to plead out to non-life sentences for orchestrating crimes and street terrorism that merit, in my view, the death penalty.	2000-09-24

While I agree with most of the sentiments of the reviewers that gave it unstintingly glowing reviews, I'm finding it a little bit difficult to keep track of the dozens of players (cops, crooks, DAs etc).  The author helpfully provides a list of characters at the beginning, but I think that he should throw into the paperback edition a diagram of the Wild Cowboys organization (with the names, aliases, and &quot;jobs&quot; written in) as well as a chronology of events.  It's hard to keep things straight without them, and I'm almost tempted to start reading it again and take notes so I completely understand what is happening.	2000-09-21

Sometimes, the &quot;snitch&quot; gains the upper hand in his or her relationship with the law enforcement  agency involved.  This is precisely what happened in the Bulger case.   Except it wasn't just a situation with one policeman crossing the line but  a group of them.  And the misconduct went beyond the ordinary to the point  where the tail was quite literally wagging the dog.<br />So far, my impression  of &quot;Black Mass&quot; is very favorable.  It appears meticulously  researched and is written in an easy to read style.  My one complaint is  that the biographical details on Bulger are a little sketchy in places.   Specifically, the authors only briefly mention what Bulger did before he  got out of prison.  I would have found it useful to know more about what he  was doing while &quot;in the can&quot; and before.<br />Yet I'd rather have  less biographical details from that period than too many (which is a  mistake some authors make --overwhelming their readers with a crushing  amount of trivia).	2000-06-01

I won't spoil the tale  here but will simply say oh, to have come so far after suffering so much  and then to die like that!<br />James Bond addicts are not going to find much  here to their liking.  The deaths Gup chronicles are either very ordinary  --a car accident, a plane crash-- or provide dramatic proof that even  intelligence officers are not immune to a bullet or bomb.  But the  character sketches of the often heroic men and women who died these sad  deaths are quite compelling.  <br />And even though I accept that some of the  recent entries in the Book of Honor have to remain annonymous (at least for  the time being), it is very difficult to understand why a 21 year old  secretary who died in a car bombing 35 years ago in Saigon cannot be  acknowledged as one of the Agency's own.

I'm a Gulf War veteran but suffered from a &quot;worm's eye&quot; view of what was going on while I was there.  &quot;Crusade&quot; gave me the big and little  picture.<br />About the only thing negative I can say is that I do not agree  with the author's conclusion that the decision to end the ground war was  the right one or as he put it &quot;durable.&quot; I think that events of  the last nine years have shown how great a mistake it was to stop early and  let the Iraqis out of the bag.  Maybe if we had said &quot;public opinion  be damned&quot; and pressed forward for a few more days, Saddam might have  lost too much of his military forces to keep him in power.  And Schwarzkopf  deserves a big raspberry for his prima donna behvior during the conflict.   Our press made him out to be some kind of &quot;teddy bear&quot; military  genius when the truth was far from that.	2000-05-19
US	52291152	R1OEEMHJYUTCIN	0451165667	399084864	Fatal Vision	Books	5	19	22	N	N	An Unforgettable Story	Like Fisher's book about the Lindberg Kidnapping, this is a true crime story I find myself picking up to read again and again.  There is something just so haunting about Doctor McDonald, a man who had everything and  destroyed it all in about two minutes of blind fury.<br />I'm struck by the  hostility expressed in some of the reviews to Joe McGinnis.  It seems so  misplaced.  As the author himself pointed out, &quot;Fatal Vision&quot; did  not convict Jeffrey McDonald.  That was done by a jury of his peers in a  Federal court in North Carolina. Those people --one of them a former member  of the Special Forces-- were exposed to far more information (text and  graphic) than any book could possibly contain (and that includes  &quot;Fatal Justice&quot;).  And having heard it, those twelve people voted  to convict McDonald.  <br />As for McGinnis, he just wrote the book.  He was  not a factor in the trial.  Maybe he was less than candid with McDonald.   Maybe his tactics in winning McDonald's trust were repulsive.  But anything  McGinnis did pales in comparison to the unspeakable crimes that the  defendant committed.<br />On a final note, I would advise any would-be author  of true crime stories to study this book's organization and style.  I found  it very useful when I wrote my book (which was published in  Ireland).<br />Bottom line:  I will always be uneasy about &quot;Fatal  Vision.&quot;  The mind rebels against the notion of a bright, charming,  talented doctor savagely murdering his pregnant wife and daughters.  But  I'd be even more uneasy to see &quot;Doctor&quot; Jeffrey McDonald set  free.	2000-05-13

Ever since reading Handelman's &quot;Comrade Criminal,&quot; I have been interested in the Russian mafiya.<br />But I think Handelman's book spoiled this one for me.   &quot;Comrade Criminal&quot; focused on the organized crime situation in  Russia.  However, it had some fairly interesting tidbits about the  expansion of the mobs into the United States and other  countries.<br />Friedman's book was a little too breathless and exaggerated  for me.  For example, there was his claim that the Genovese Crime Family  was earning billions of dollars.  That seems a bit much.  I could believe  it of the Cali Drug Cartel certainly, but not an association of thugs that  the FBI has decimated in the last twenty years.<br />I also found myself  losing confidence in the author for another exaggeration.  According to one  expert drawn on by PBS's Frontline program about the mafiya, Vyacheslav  Ivankov, the Russian gangster who sent the nasty Valentine's Day card to  the author, may have been a big fish, but he probably was not &quot;the Red  Godfather&quot; of America.<br />A final irritant was Friedman's getting the  name of the DEA wrong.  It's the &quot;Drug Enforcement  Administration&quot; not &quot;Drug Enforcement Agency.&quot;  It's a small  mistake, but it does make you wonder how closely the book was fact-checked  (and how much the author really spent around DEA agents who would have  certainly set him straight).<br />So I'd recommend that readers get  &quot;Comrade Criminal&quot; and not this book.	2000-05-12

I commend the author for writing about his experiences and salute his writing skills.<br />But...<br />I'm a little disturbed at the constant  application of moral equivalency between the United States and United  Nations' actions in Somalia and those of the Somali gunmen.  I accept that  the US and UN made grave mistakes in Somalia, mistakes that cost at least  several thousand lives.  But these mistakes pale in comparison to the  crimes committed by the Somalis, particularly by the likes of General  Aidid.  I find it particularly offensive when the author alleges that  American soldiers, in the wake of a helicopter attack on a house occupied  by Aidid's top advisors, shot survivors without mercy.  That is a very  grave allegation, and the author never tries to substantiate it.<br />Another  thing the author should have stressed about the Somalia debacle is the fact  that the Somali gunmen were the ones who drew first blood. They were the  ones who killed --and mutilated! -- twenty-five Pakistani peacekeepers in  July 1993.  Yet the author blames the UN's decision to go after Aidid and  not the other clans for causing this hideous act.  His thesis is that if  the UN had gone after all the clans and tried to make them disarm, the  Somalis would have accepted it.  Maybe.  And maybe there still would have  been violence.  And maybe in this book the author would have condemned that  decision to go after all the clans as being too ambitious.  Maybe.<br />Bottom  line:  a very good read if you go in realizing it is the epitome of  &quot;Monday morning quarterbacking&quot;	2000-05-06

I disagree.  A better description would be &quot;a useful book for people who know a fair amount about the region who can pick out  the valid from the ludicrous.&quot;<br />I say that because mixed in with all  the useful history are comments that caused this reader to go  &quot;Huh?&quot; or &quot;What!&quot; or &quot;Oh, c'mon!&quot;<br />I'll give  just two examples:<br />1.  The author states his belief that the United  States conspired to have the late General Zia, military dictator of  Pakistan, assassinated.  Really?  Last I recall, there is an executive  order in the United States prohibiting assassinations.  Given this fact, I  think the author ought to substantiate such an incredible allegation, not  just toss it in as an off-hand comment.<br />2.  The author informs us that  the Syrians stopped their advance on the Golan Heights in the 1973 War  because they were afraid the Israelis would hit them with nuclear weapons.   That flies in the face of everything I've read about that particular war,  namely that the Israelis stopped the Syrians by simply fighting like  crazy.<br />Given these statements, I'm left wondering how many more  questionable assertions of fact are in the book.  It's a pity, not just  because I shelled out over 20 dollars for it, but because, a book like  &quot;War at the Top of the World&quot; is badly needed.  It just needs to  be written by someone who does not go far out on a limb with incredible  claims like the ones I've mentioned above.	2000-04-16

This is the first book about the Ramsey case I have bought and probably will ever buy.  All the previous ones seemed to be lacking somehow. And given what is in the public domain about this case, I would never buy the  Ramseys' book.<br />As of today, I'm only seventy pages into the text. Yet  like the title of my review says, I'm having a hard time putting it down.   The authors have made a clear presentation of the facts and contrary to the  claims of the Ramsey family attorney, their account does not read like a  tabloid.  Far from it, it is a somberly told tale.  I find its credibility  very high because Steven Thomas freely admits how badly the Boulder Police  Department damaged the investigation by allowing the crime scene to be  corrupted.<br />That's one theme of the book.  The other is that the Boulder  District Attorney's Office seems to have a problem aggressively pursuing  people who have committed crimes of violence and taking them to trial.   Influenced perhaps by the &quot;new age&quot; attitudes present in Boulder,  the DAs appear far more likely to accept plea bargains.<br />I have no doubt  that some people are going to accuse Mr. Thomas for leaking sensitive  information about the case.  Senior officials will go on record about how  &quot;shocked&quot; they are about his writing this book.  They will argue  that he has damaged the chances of ever bringing the murderer to trial.   Yet that presupposes that was ever going to happen.  Sad to say, I think  Jonbenet's killer will never be brought to book. That person has gotten  away with it.	2000-04-12

I quite simply could not put it down.  For me, Smith exposed the true ugliness behind phrases like &quot;euthanasia,&quot; &quot;soft landing,&quot; or &quot;final  exit.&quot;  They are all synonyms for another  word...&quot;killing.&quot;<br />I can only hope that the recent conviction of  Kevorkian shows that we are turning the tide in the battle against  euthanasia.	2000-02-01
US	52291152	R3G0MNTKBTGKPH	0880642432	919837710	The Hunt for the Engineer: How Israeli Agents Tracked the Hamas Master Bomber	Books	3	12	16	N	N	Worthwhile but flawed	I eagerly waited for this book's release.  I am fascinated by terrorism and a narrative relating Israel's pursuit of the notorious Ayyash sounded like a intriguing story.<br />Well, it is, but I have (I am still reading the  book) two bones to pick with the narrative:<br />1.  Overhyped language:  I  know the book is intended for a popular audience (as opposed to academic)  but the overuse of dramatic adjectives tends to give it a superficial tone  (even if the information content is serious --which it is).  Sometimes,  less is more.<br />2.  Moral one-sidedness:  I am hardly an apologist for a  group like Hamas.  However, the author would have done well to have thrown  in some more reasons why a group like Hamas might exist and be popular with  the Palestinian population.  Sad to say, some of this information does not  reflect great credit on the Shin Bet (the Israeli General Security  Service), which the author admires so much, or other Israeli government  organizations.<br />For example, Katz might have related in detail that in  1984, Shin Bet operatives beat to death  two Palestinian bus hijackers and  then tried to frame an Israeli Army general for the murders.<br />Or when  talking about Hamas's vicious murder of Border Policeman Nissim Toledano,  Katz should have pointed out that the Border Police have sometimes dealt  with the Palestinian population in an extremely brutal fashion and made  themselves into logical and highly popular targets for a group like  Hamas.<br />If Katz had taken a slightly more balanced and less overheated  tone, he would have produced a superb book that cast Hamas in the bad light  it deserves but retained more credibility by acknowledging the Israelis are  not flawless supermen.  Written the way it is now, &quot;The Hunt for the  Engineer&quot; sometimes comes across as a sort of &quot;puff piece&quot;  for the Israeli security services.	2000-01-26
US	52291152	R1CMNH4EPOYTNW	1555534074	76262389	The New Jackals: Ramzi Yousef, Osama bin Laden, and the Future of Terrorism (Vol 1)	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Better than the Bodansky Book but a Little Shallow	Osama Bin Ladin is a man who deserves to have a biography written about him.  He is --after all-- the prime enemy of the United States, our public enemy number one.<br />Yet Reeve's book doesn't quite answer the mail.  The  presence of wild speculation degrades the &quot;hard journalism&quot; the  book contains. <br />Two cases in point:<br />1.  Reeve suggests that the United  States took part in an assassination attempt against Bin Ladin (an attempt  poison the man).  Mr. Reeve does not seem to be aware that there is an  executive order prohibiting such actions by the United States.  When  America tries to kill an enemy, we use things like cruise missiles and  smart bombs and call it &quot;targeting command and control  structures.&quot;<br />2.  Reeve spends too much time regurgitating the theory  put forward by Tim McVeigh's attorney that Terry Nichols was the real  mastermind behind the Oklahoma City Bombing.  In my humble opinion, the  fact that Nichols and Ramzi Yousef may have been in the Philippines at the  same time does not mean anything.  It is --after all-- a big place.   The  speculation about Oklahoma City would have been better placed as a  paragraph-long footnote and not three pages of text.<br />Still, Reeve's book  is a lot better than Bodansky's book.	1999-11-14

It has a very strong opening and I found the investigation into the friendly fire theory  very convincing (it didn't happen).<br />However, the book is too much the  FBI's view of the story.  I have great respect for the bureau, but there  were other players involved in this case as well.<br />Also, the book got  needlessly sentimental about very extraneous topics.  I really, really,  really did not want to know about Special Agent's Kallstrom's time in  Vietnam.  That is totally removed from his role in the investigation.<br />Oh,  and reading a number of stories about him in the news makes me think that  he's not exactly a &quot;fun&quot; boss for which to work.	1999-09-11

In the Blink of An Eye is a long overdue book, one that does a lot to dispell the conspiracy theory &quot;sick think&quot; that has surrounded the case.<br />It is also quite heartbreaking at times.<br />However, I can't  give it five stars, because I think the author was a little too much in awe  of the FBI and her protagonist, Special Agent Kallstrom.  I'm full of  admiration for the FBI, and I think Kallstrom did well.  However, the  author might have done well to include a few more anecdotes about mistakes  the FBI made during its investigation.  It might have added additional  credibility.<br />Also, I wonder if Kallstrom is as well loved in the FBI as  the author claims.  Personally, I would get a little sick of him screaming  at people.  Perhaps his subordinates might have taken it in stride, but I  imagine he probably alienated a number of people outside his control.  The  author's characterization of him makes me think of  General Schwarzkopf and  his tendency to shout and rave at people.  Still, he had a very tough job  to do.	1999-07-28

But I was saddened to discover that it makes a number of statements that are very hard to credit.  <br />1.  Iran and Bin Laden work together:  Really?  My  readings tell me  that Shi'a (Iran) and Sunni (Bin Laden) traditions tend to disdain each  other (if not outright hate each other  --Sunnis consider Shi'as heretics).   Bin Laden's hosts, the Taliban are extreme Sunnis and the Iranians have  almost gone to war with them over their treatment of Shi'as in Afghanistan.   Therefore, I kinda sorta doubt that they'd be working together.<br />2.  TWA  800:  Bodansky stubbornly clings to the view that TWA 800 was destroyed by  Islamist terrorists.  This is despite the conclusions by the NTSB and FBI  that it was an accident. Bodansky implies that the terrorist attack was  deliberately covered up.  Why?  Why would we do that and why would the  terrorists not directly claim the attack?<br />People interested in this topic  should wait a little while longer for a more serious book to appear.	1999-07-17
