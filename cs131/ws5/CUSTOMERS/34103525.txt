Champlin bravely asserts his own contribution to the great wealth of Neronian scholarship for the critics to pick apart. I find very little to quibble about.<br />It is difficult to write even-handedly about Nero for a Western audience. Who could forget the image of a man who \\"fiddled while Rome burned\\" or the terrible tyrant who had begun a nearly 170 year \\"persecution\\" of the early Christians, under whose reign both Peter and Paul were executed? As other reviewer comments reveal, you can easily earn the brand of a Nero \\"apologist\\" if you don't tow the party line, however inaccurate it might be.<br /><br />Champlin's thesis can be stated simply as follows: many, if not most of Nero's grandstands and outrageous actions, were performed out of considerable political shrewdness and calculation - not the madness or puerile excess wrongly attributed to a \\"live fast, die young, and leave a good looking corpse\\" emperor. Nero's success, Champlin argues in the first chapter, is evinced by a shockingly prolonged \\"afterlife\\" manifested in pseudo-Neros, Judeo-Christian apocalyptic writings, and a disenfranchised populace openly lamenting his death. Nonetheless, I cannot help but wonder, (working on the same assumption,) whether he had truly orchestrated his public relations as well as Champlin suggests given his untimely demise at age 30.<br /><br />Some reviewers disagree, but I reckon Champlin's original Nero-Periander link to be one of the most intriguing ideas in ancient biography I've ever seen. The ambivalent relationship with the mother, the Philhellenism, the artistic bent, and the numerous other links are too compelling to ignore outright, even if the conclusion a hard sell. Further research is warranted, but I suspect that Champlin, with his great intellect and energy, may have already exhausted all of the available evidence for advancing his thesis. He demonstrates the Augustus/Antony connections thoroughly. The discussion of the great fire of 64 is arrestingly well done: after convincingly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration. It hits you with dramatic effect almost equal to one of the primary sources comprising the centerpiece of his proof in this sudden reversal: Tacitus' Annales XV.67.<br /><br />Champlin's organization is somewhat bothersome as it is in \\"Final Judgments,\\" because he rejects chronological arrangement for thematic foci. This requires repetition of several facts, and I cannot understand his reasons for the chapter order. The post-mortem legacy of Nero, being most fascinating, he puts up front obviously to hook his reader. It serves as an interesting set piece for further discourse, because the inevitable wonder we feel about Nero's impression on the world ever after demands explanation: thus the rest of the book. But with Dio, Suetonius, and Tacitus unfolding the bulk of their own histories so methodically, the rearrangement isn't always a neat fit. Still, Champlin's brilliant weaving together of hundreds of sources, as before, vindicates his literary decisions several times over.<br /><br />Champlin, like any other historian, has his hypotheses and directs his evidence toward proving them. His presentation however, is replete with past scholarship and primary sources presented candidly and fairly. One of the most appreciable inclusions is the extensive collection of Latin graffiti, which add a critical dimension to our knowledge. This book has been for me an introduction into full-strength Neronian scholarship and I found it both accessible and empowering enough to read further with confidence.ngly presenting the defense for Nero's innocence, he suddenly shatters the deception in stating that despite this preceding evidence, Nero undoubtedly held direct responsibility for the coflagration.

With few exceptions, (e.g. Scopes trial, O.J. Simpson trial) the lawyer, that civic advocate and protector of justice, rarely receives deserved recognition. We sit collectively on the edge of our seats with eyes and ears pealed for damning witness testimonies and blood-stained clothes. Evidence is rarely that clear, Seidemann informs us, and most real life cases turn on the efficacy of the lawyer. This book renews our appreciation for a profession derided so often for its dishonesty that we have forgotten the sad and dangerous implications behind the humor. Within these pages of heart-wrenching tragedies and controversies that rocked our nation, you will surely re-experience memories of the incidents as the opening/closing statements verify or challenge what you believe. Seidemann reminds us that we have conferred upon lawyers the great responsibility of juridicial guardianship, in order to shake us out of complacency and reaffirm our right to demand rectitude and loyalty to their oath.<br /><br />For Generation Y and the Millennials, &#34;In the Interest of Justice&#34; should be required reading for the oft neglected legal aspect of cultural literacy. Direct accounts of the gruesome atrocities perpetuated by Adolph Eichmann and the SS, Johnny Cochran's convoluted deconstruction of the Simpson evidence, the Bernard Goetz incident, and the unmitigated hatred of Zacharias Moussaoui in his own words far exceed detached summaries of these pivotal moments in the collective American psyche. Though older generations may have lived through and internalized these events, imperceptibly they seem to hold less and less power as time goes by and younger leaders step up to the fore. Hopefully, this book will spur other writers to popularize equally important judicial landmarks with the same care to the preservation of the primary evidence and with equally astute explanations. These are more than exciting cases and history lessons. Seidemann compels us to consider personally the merits and risks of the sometimes flawed but inviolable bedrock of American freedom and security: its criminal justice system.p to the fore.

Hesse demonstrates the breadth of a good liberal arts education in his magnum opus. His candid commentaries on influential world-views and human events, as told through Harry Haller's diary, flirt with a grand synthesis of truth and being on a Nietzschean scale. Hesse however, carefully avoids taking that plunge into the impersonal and absolute (or the ascent into the ivory tower, if you will,) and refuses to commit to a system. \\"Steppenwolf\\" is throughly intellectual, but ultimately about people.<br />The novel's interbellum German backdrop forms a sketchy but unsettling national parallel to the inner turmoil and despair of a man caught in his own approaching meltdown. Anyone able to understand and discuss the book even superficially must identify with _some_ of Haller's miseries or hopes. Haller's self-castigating introspection runs such a comprehensive gamut that sometimes I wonder whether Hesse had sat down with a checklist of every great thinker from Socrates to Sartre to ensure fair time for every primal and contrived source of mental anguish in Western thought. An ordered map of Haller's thoughts would surely reveal numerous inconsistencies, and maybe that's okay - even genius. On an obvious level, there is something for everyone in the protagonist. But more poignantly, the contradiction of his neuroses and sorrows in toto may be precisely what transcend the pages and become the reader's own - to whatever extent. Like Haller, real people often harbor simultaneous grievances and anxieties, surfacing in different circumstances, trapping us in vicious circles. Hesse makes a point early in the novel that Haller's belief in lycanthropic duality is folly, because it oversimplifies the real man: a countless multiplicity of personalities in several shades. If there is one major disappointment in the book, it is that Hesse lets this notion quickly fade, to be evoked again only in the final act.<br /><br />And therefore, I sometimes harbor an ambiguous and borderline philistine suspicion that Hesse's simpler \\"Siddhartha\\" not only stands as his supreme achievement, but also subsumed everything important in \\"Steppenwolf,\\" and related it more directly. If one cannot become absorbed by Haller's thoughts or moved by his lamentations, reading \\"Steppenwolf\\" can be trying at times. In less than half the pages, Siddhartha's search for identity and truth takes him through many similar circumstances, which Hesse gives no shallow treatment as pieces within a greater struggle. Hesse's fascination with Oriental philosophy was never a secret, but its ultimate value in his optimistic hope for man and humanity (see Hesse's foreword in the newer editions,) is a more important question remaining to be answered.of personalities in several shades.

In style and reader engagement \\"Cat's Cradle\\" has held up very well over the last 5 decades. Vonnegut was undoubtedly an original writer with a sharp wit. He manages to constrain the characters (narrator excepted) within the two-dimensional paper dolls expected of satire while running a thread of mystery through each. Even the awkwardly shallow Mrs. Crosby has a line or two that give us pause.<br /><br />Nevertheless, both Vonnegut and the mysterious Caribbean guru of his creation preface their words repeatedly with an explicit warning not to take any of it seriously. This clouds the book's foggy voyage to deep meaning. Typical Vonnegut fans seem to brush aside the self-effacement as sardonically clever when granting high accolades, but accept a paradox when taking his deconstructionist ideas to heart . Does anyone really \\"get\\" Vonnegut's message, or is he inwardly laughing at those gullible enough to ignore it? Does the emperor have no clothes?<br /><br />Someone else's comparison between Bokononism and Scientology struck an agreeable chord. Both are obviously the figment of a modern mind and seek to reorder human psychology across cultural boundaries, alluding only to vague cosmological bases. Of course Hubbard was real and institutionalized, but either belief system could fill a spiritual longing unmet by the weekly grind of the church routine when the clergy loses touch with people or rebellion seeks an outlet. \\"Cat's Cradle\\" might capture the hearts of an audience in that delicate stage of personal growth when one begins to question the beliefs of their parents and community, but hasn't the knowledge or courage to study the more robust and well-established alternatives closely. It is a fine book with amusingly honest observations on the plight of humanity, but I sincerely hope people come to understand that satirical pop philosophy and the serious masterworks of world literature have distinct literary forms and ends.	2005-05-21

After having read the reviews previously posted on this site I was surprised and dismayed at how so many people have come away from the book accepting everything at face value, believing that the author has presented an unbiased account of the terrible circumstances in the South Bronx. &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; is actually a one-sided and drawn out appeal to the emotions, offering no effective solutions, and muddled what needs clear and honest analysis. People should be asking why Kozol failed to include more than a single 4 line exchange with one of the ghetto's many drug addicts or any open discussions with the politicians whom he indirectly indicts for the horrors Mott Haven's residents face. A two paragraph summary of Ferrer's words hardly counterbalances the dozens of pages devoted to direct transcriptions of the words of parents and children.<br /><br />One might ask just how Kozol controls facts to suit his aims. Having been born and raised in New York City, let me cite two egregious examples. First is the false socioeconomic dichotomy Kozol contrives between the failing Taft H. S. and Stuyvesant H. S. where I had enrolled about one year after &#34;Amazing Grace's&#34; publication date. Far from being an institution for the reproduction of the social capital of the white upper class elite, Stuyvesant's Caucasian population is only 40% while over 53% of it is Asian American. 35% of the incoming class in 2003 came from families poor enough for eligibility in the free lunch program, and this number rises when accounting for reduced lunch too. This is verifiable in publicly available NYC Dept. of Ed. data. Stuyvesant's student body represents over 60 countries of origin and lives in all 5 boroughs. Secondly, I take issue with the incorrect perception that the police do not enter the ghetto. Freely accessible NYPD information shows that Mott Haven is served by NYC's 40th precinct located right there on 257 Alexander Ave. and has a high arrest rate. Again, why did Kozol not interview these officers? I suppose some readers do not recall that Kozol also mentions the disproportionately high population of South Bronx residents in Riker's Island prison. How is this consistent with the alleged inactivity of the police? The more likely causes of perpetuated criminal activity in Mott Haven are entangled with political and cultural factors scarcely touched upon in &#34;Amazing Grace&#34;.<br /><br />Are the horrific social conditions and personal tragedies reported by Kozol factual? Most of them probably are, but the wrongly vilified Rudolph Giuliani cannot conceivably deserve the blame for most or perhaps any of it, when during his stint as mayor the NYC crime rate dropped over 25%. Conversely, when Dinkins, Beame, Koch, and Lindsay had held the office, they simply fiddled as Mott Haven steadily degenerated in those post Civil Rights decades prior to 1995. Kozol never inquires into the events accounting for Mott Haven's racial makeup, particularly the post WWII African American migration from the south as the war industry dried up, and the ethically questionable efforts of congressman Vito Marcantonio to entice and install Puerto Rican immigrants into the ghetto during the 1950s in order to enlarge his voter base. More recently, pirate Pedro Espada has been convicted on federal charges funneling money out of his health clinic to nepotist ends, and Ruben Diaz' &#34;triumphantly&#34; defeated the shopping mall development that would have potentially brought in hundreds of jobs. History just doesn't serve Kozol's ends when determined to cast the wealthy as apathetic, exploitative, and evil, but it makes little difference: when social sympathizers seek answers, several have already made up their minds to accept the oversimplifications or mistruths that they like after (or even before) reading &#34;Amazing Grace&#34; and don't want to be confused by facts or think critically.<br /><br />In summary, this book is leftist &#34;white guilt&#34;literature, either clueless or intentionally misleading. This is not objective journalism, and it will probably do more harm than good for the people it claims to support. Kozol will probably accomplish little more than help inflame well-meaning reformers into pushing more wrongheaded policies. The people of the South Bronx deserve better.r intentionally misleading.

US	34103525	R3HYLASZ2W9WS9	0205282679	681173806	Beyond Behaviorism: Changing the Classroom Management Paradigm	Books	2	7	15	N	N	There's no getting beyond it.	Has it all been a crude attempt up until now to teach kids? Were we really so misguided about American classroom management practices before 1970, when the public education system had produced the bright and industrious minds which helped propel the fledgling industrial nation to the position of leading superpower? Freiberg and friends are ready to tell you how outdated and ineffective the old fashioned methods have become if we hope to revitalize and sustain good behavior and academic excellence in our troubled contemporary schools.<br /><br />Freiberg pens a couple of chapters in the introduction and conclusion concerning the history of classroom management, a few case histories of the Australian public education system in which he personally had been involved, and some general pep talk for teachers who want their caring and humanistic preconceptions of good teaching validated. Sandwiched in between are four chapters contributed by experts in education research, each author outlining and promoting his/her own complete system of classroom management.<br /><br />Among the programs, C.O.M.P. is the only plausible approach, as it offers several useful pieces of tips and compartmentalizes aspects of management into useful categories for analysis. It does not however, consider the social realities of the larger community, other teachers, and the administration. I trained under Alene Harris, and the best thing I took away was a nomenclature and a method for explaining the elements of classroom management. Its central tenet \\"prevention is better than intervention\\" was unrealistic, but leagues more useful than the untenable ends of the other programs, which are better suited to alternate realities. CMCD is a gushy, disorganized mess. Its model of the \\"student citizen\\" is an impractical fantasy and conflicts conceptually with its initial caring group focus. Nevertheless, it has a few interesting things to say about running a more efficient classroom through the delegation of perfunctory responsibilities to students. \\"Judicious Discipline\\" and The Three Cs program are further out in left field, promoting ideas such as \\"complete student autonomy\\" and \\"constructive conflict.\\" The time spent on these programs' lengthy activities designed to increase self-concept not only siphon off precious hours better spent in academic content, but also still rely implicitly on superficially spurned behaviorist theories. Case in point, the chapter on The Three C's, on page 145, suggests integrating community into the classroom by offering kids coupons to local stores that they frequent - so much for extolling the value of intrinsic motivation! The Johnsons' own research comprises over 90% of the sources cited in the chapter, and readers should note that it was conducted almost exclusively with students in the elementary grades. Furthermore, the Johnson & Johnson school of thought on group learning has been in academic battle with Robert Slavin's competitive for a while now, and the complete absence of the latter's contribution strongly suggests editorial bias. The creators of the \\"Judicious Discipline\\" at least have the sense to recommend tailoring consequences to the individual student and directly teaching students the rules and cues of the classroom. (But then again, hadn't even the vilified Canter figured that out in \\"Power to the Teacher\\"?) Nevertheless, despite applying their methods in highly controlled environments, the founders of the JD program themselves could not even muster the \\"autonomy\\" level in more than 50% of their test subjects in any given school.<br /><br />When will this oversimplified demonization of behavioral psychology finally cease, so that we can begin to make great strides in improving failing school systems instead of grandiose promises? Behaviorism merely describes well-controlled observable human nature; it isn't a philosophy or a belief at all, let alone one that is wrong, evil, or fatalistic. It will either detract fromor enhance teaching and learning: it will not be rooted out and destroyed. Past studies have demonstrated its effectiveness in producing positive learning outcomes when understood and applied properly. Some \\"experts\\" apparently just don't want to accept that education theory has a strong scientific component nor the fact that all students, to a great extent, learn and respond in the same way. Classroom management would be greatly demystified if we simply tossed out the crazy untestable and unfalsifiable theories. Likewise, we should stop denying valid findings simply because they do not suit our personal or political agenda. Misinformation is no friend of progress.learning: it will not be rooted out and destroyed.

Each edition is individually compiled with some variation in the tablets, translators supplement the lacunae uniquely, and newer versions might include recently uncovered and interesting details as the epigraphers continue to work away. It is also a relatively short book and clear in style despite most efforts to overembellish it. What Mitchell has done is indeed useful, examining several existing modern translations and synthesizing them into a contemporary edition that draws upon their individual strengths.<br /><br />I recommend skipping much of the introduction if unfamiliar with the epic because though Mitchell's summary is quite good, it fully spoils the story. But do go back and enjoy it after finishing the main text in order to pick up on his worthwhile literary insights.<br /><br />The endnotes are profuse, and Mitchell excerpts his primary sources in English when he has taken liberties with them. Flipping back and forth however, was tedious and detracted from the smoothness of his verse. I recommend reading the main text through once uninterrupted, and then checking the commentary frequently when attempting it a second time. At some points it seems that Mitchell has inserted too much sentiment not found the original sources, such as with Humbaba's speech.<br /><br />I was a bit annoyed to learn that the gold mask on the cover depicts Sargon of Akkad and not Gilgamesh (read M. Eileen Eisemann's review below) but regardless, this book is worthwhile for updating the tenuous connection between near-eastern scholarship and popular readership. It is also a fine shelf piece and a pleasant (re-)read on a lazy day.	2005-01-12

I am not a regular reader of science fiction but one of my former student mentees surely is, and knowing my academic background he turned me on a while ago to this novel, what I'd call a \\"techno-classical epic\\". Although it took a considerable length of time for my enthusiasm and interest to overcome some initial surface friction when beginning the book, I am very glad that I stuck it out all the way through.<br /><br />Simmons begins his opus shakily. Thomas Hockenberry sullies the pure beauty and beautiful purity of Homer's opening with his own peevish and potty-mouthed bitching and moaning. Neither is the world of Ardis Hall and Paris Crater very engrossing before the character \\"Savi\\" comes on stage and injects some sorely needed purpose and reader interest into that para-developing story line. (Simmons includes a dramatis personae as an appendix which in retrospect I would say would have better suited a preface). But the narrative which took longest to appreciate was the tale of the Jupiter duo, who drone on endlessly in their ship about Shakespeare, Proust, their secret mission (even they're in the dark about it), and their often incomprehensible futuristic technologies. Things do pick up quite a bit however, when they reach Mars.<br /><br />Surely enough, if you have the patience, Simmons does not disappoint. Though an earlier reviewer agrees that the non-Iliadic story lines develop too slowly for those of us who are less than diehard sci-fi fans, each of the slowly intertwining sub-plots steadily builds toward a tremendous interlocking climax, tantalizingly cut short by the break between this volume and its sequel. Characters do eventually start coming into conflict, face exhilirating adversities, and give the narrative several good twists. The last 150 pages the book kept me awake late into the night.<br /><br />Ilium has primed my interest in Simmons writing talent to seriously consider picking up his older Hyperion series, but I am witholding a decision on that until I can judge how well he concludes this current story in the upcoming \\"Olympos\\". In addition to asking \\"what happens next\\" after finishing \\"Ilium\\", I am left with many questions about what I have already read and I sincerely hope that the sequel will answer them.how well he concludes this current story in the upcoming \\"Olympos\\".

It emerged at a time when Baghdad was once a great center of arts and sciences, and when Sufism had sprung up and thrived within a culture that would eventually come to harden its doctrines and restrict new ideas and forms of expression. Although the several short divisions of the book appeared out of joint on first reading, I would not be surprised if someone better versed than I in this field has argued well for a linear progression. Regardless, the work stands strong as a marvelous collection of witticisms, musings, and keen observations on the human condition - both subtle and blunt in type.<br /><br />The poet of Shiraz was evidently quite the wanderer. Educated in Baghdad, he traveled to Persia, India, Ethiopia, Syria (narrowly escaping Frankish enslavement), N. Africa, and Anatolia before returning to his homeland. His writing is often daring and irreverent, sharply critical of conventional political structures as well as newfangled religious charlatans. The common folk and the rich are equally exposed for their faults. But despite Sa'di's wise and stern moralizing, there remains a strong undercurrent of wry humor and an Epicurean aloofness counterbalancing the solemnity of any real ethics. One can almost see the author flashing us a cryptic smile when he preaches in verse. Is he insinuating moderation in thought? Are there hidden meanings? Is it all just an artistic exercise in irony? I don't know, and I find \\"The Rose Garden\\" all the more charming for inducing me to second guess my assumptions about its intent.<br /><br />Cranmer-Byng has done a wonderful service in rendering an English translation of this rarely found Persian classic.	2004-12-29

Some people have commented that his treatment is outdated, but a thorough understanding of chapters 6, 8, and 10 should equip anyone to understand the newer forms of notation. Chapter 7 is notably excellent but seemed out of place. As the most advanced of the whole book, it relates more than later chapters to the \\"further reading\\" topics. Proof of the redundancy of \\"indirect proof\\" (chapter 3?) and multi-modal logic were other very notable highlights.<br /><br />A few criticisms: Copi explains the quantification rules of first order predicate logic rather tersely for a primer, and I was glad to have used Virginia Klenk's book originally when encountering these concepts. (Although Klenk's explanation of EI and UG are non-standard and will make transitioning very confusing if you cannot grasp the validity of her methods.) The index only provides a step by step answer key for selected exercises, which leaves stuck if Copi has solved only one problem to demonstrate some concept which still isn't clear. Finally, the binding on this book is just cheap. On all copies that I have encountered, the glued pages were breaking away from the spine after only a few months of regular use. Perhaps the newer edition is better, but I haven't had experience with it.<br /><br />Despite these rather minor shortcomings, Copi's work unfolds almost as systematically as the content it teaches. This is an excellent introduction.	2004-12-20

That books like this still have 4 - 4.5 star ratings is testament to the fact that a sucker is born each minute. Every time a black-clad teenager with dyed hair purchases a copy of \\"The Necronomicon\\" it is a slap in the collective faces of his/her parents,  Judeo-Christian religion, the last three centuries of science, and public education. And that is just why they purchase it: so many anti-establishment beliefs all bound into one book make it an irresistable avenue for adolescent discontent.<br /><br />Let's start with three reasons as to why no sane and educable human being should believe that this book is a credible grimoire:<br />1) There is no such being \\"Kutulu,\\" which features prominently in this book, to be found in any Near Eastern pantheon. The name stems from the work of HP Lovecraft and has nothing to do with \\"Chthonian,\\" which is traceable back only as far as the Greek word for \\"earth.\\"<br />2)  Akkadian, the language used in most of the incantations, was lost until the late 18th century/early 19th century and hence there is no way that the purported \\"Mad Arab\\" of the 8th century CE would have learned it. Another similar giveaway is the haphazard use of the earlier Sumerian equivalents for a number of the deities mentioned (Enki, Nanna, Inanna, etc.) Sumerian ceased to be spoken ca. 1500 BCE. and its written form was entirely lost well before the turn of the common era and not rediscovered until the 19th century.<br />3) The author makes many claims for the existence of an age old cult of Tiamat worship. Not a shred of literary or archaeological evidence even suggests such a thing existed.<br /><br />So why does the book sell?<br />1) Design.

So I picked up a cheap used copy and read it cover to cover. The only question I have left is why anyone would bother with any of the other crap. This book effectively condenses the entirety of the self-help field. As far as I can tell, this is as good as it gets by the standards of the genre, is enjoyably accessible to a general audience, and has weathered time's attack on its relevance stunningly well.<br /><br />Firstly, Maltz had the raw clinical experience necessary to write this kind of book. As a crackerjack plastic surgeon he saw immediately and firsthand the life-changing or life-stalling power of self-image at work in the faces of his patients. (And anyone who scoffs at unorthodox contributors to a research field ought to know that Albert Einstein was working for the Swiss patent office when he submitted the Theory of Special Relativity.) Yet Maltz also admits where exactly the limits of his knowledge lie rather than try to convince the reader of his omniscience.<br /><br />Secondly, Maltz was receptive to many fundamental tenets of psychology and philosophy and works them into Psycho Cybernetics clearly and without contradiction. Nor does he try to repackage ancient metaphysical hokum with inane and feeble examples.<br /><br />Thirdly, there are no workshops, special reports, live phone help, or products to buy. (Though I cannot speak for the organization that has cropped up around Maltz's name.) All pretense and exaggeration for marketing purposes seem absent from his book.<br /><br />Maltz was definitive and unequivocal in his ideas, quick to set a standard and stick to it. He took seriously some very fundamental issues of life and makes clear statements. This book rises high above the haphazard pop philosophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid. Maltz simply faced the truth of his own convictions. Psycho Cybernetics by no means outlines life management skills as an exact science, but its frank suggestions are intellectually compelling. Overall, the book is worthwhile because Maltz' honest and non-condescending style at least earns your respect, if not your belief.osophy/ethics smeared all over mass media which are either shallow and weak or imperiously stupid.

As inspirational as the legendary Miyamoto Musashi is, I consistently found myself enjoying \\"Musashi\\" less when the narrative focused on its main protagonist. My interest was better piqued when given glimpses into the supporting characters. Sasake Kojiro and Osugi were particularly delightful.<br />Musashi's story on the other hand, unfolds predictably and stoically, his perseverence overshadowing and eventually extinguishing his many negative traits. I do not find this inspiring as many other reviewers do. His personal transformation from a wild, arrogant, obtuse, and uncontrollably strong bull of a man into a reserved and wise strategist is over in less than half the time it takes most young men to finish puberty. Yoshikawa thumps the old \\"follow your dreams and let no adversity hold you down\\" theme too many times and it quickly grows tiresome. Other clearly \\"good\\" characters such as the weepy provincial lass Otsu and the whiny Jotaro make a similarly rushed transformation. On the other hand, Akemi, Matahachi, and the monk Takuan had much more subtlety and flair.<br />In general, Musashi's journey surged in narrative strength only episodically, when he was interacting with others instead of playing the reclusive wanderer (with the occasional squire) for self-improvement. The sub-plots are the real gems of the book, each with its own lesson, self-contained parables. The encounter with Gonnosuke Tanzaemon, his attempt to meet the lotus-cutting sword master, the showdown on the Hon'iden plain, and his sojourn with Japan's preeminent geisha rank among the best parts.<br /><br />The book's length wears on, its varying pace not justified nor by its simple theme and prolonged finale. Yoshikawa could have easily written this in 2/3rds the pages with equal effect. He certainly has a unique voice and eventually instills that delicate and complex Buddhist personality which I can only describe as \\"magnanimous humility\\" into his protagonist.	2004-12-10
US	34103525	R17CSFADVXTHZW	0449213943	15707610	All Quiet on the Western Front	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A review long overdue.	Remarque's beautiful and timeless masterpiece perhaps earns the honor of being the first modern war novel. Long gone are the days of the heroic charge with bayonettes of pre-industrial age warfare when a former college professor in a glorious moment of bravery could turn back the enemy with firm resolve and unflinching courage. Remarque sharply snaps the reader into the reality of the 20th century battlefield and reviles it as an ignoble stage of endless and faceless mayhem. He depicts World War I's legacy of prolonged battle in the filthy trenches for months, its soldiers eating rats and picking lice out of their hair, not daring to venture out of their holes for fear of being torn apart by mounted machine gun fire and explosives showers. These atrocities come through in all of their savage, bloody, physically and mentally tortuous reality. The experience permanently changes the protagonist Paul, rendering him unable to reconnect with family and adapt to civilian life back home. Absent is the noble feeling of the prestigious war hero for a local boy turned veteran. The trench becomes all that is real to Paul, his comrades the only source of understanding for his battle-hardened world view. War, Remarque implies, destroys the winners as well.<br /><br />I was reminded often of this book when watching Samuel Fuller's \\"The Big Red One\\" more recently. That film's final line seemed most fitting to Remarque's moral, that the only virtue in war is simply surviving.<br /><br />The book's writing style is simple and unadorned. The narrative flows with an unsettling smoothness because Remarque treats moments of most dire peril and those of carefree levity with equal detail in disturbingly dispassionate tone. Although at upsetting to conventional good taste concerning the urgency and emotional impact of life and death, this style quickly becomes a powerful medium to convey Paul's personal sense of priority without requiring him to openly comment upon it.<br /><br />A beautiful tale.l tale.	2004-12-08

Let's be honest with what Bill Phillips is intending to do in \\"Body for Life\\": sell more Myoplex. This artificially flavored, fortified, and caloried meal replacement is not real food. It only panders to the root of the obesity problem, which is a growing laziness in Americans to take it upon themselves to look after their health, including preparing their own nutritious meals. And even if this MRP was good for you (discounting its high sugar content, and oxidized cholesterol) you could easily concoct your own with generic whey protein or a protein blend, and some powdered maltodextrine for considerably less money.<br /><br />There's Bill Phillips exercise program: 2 days upper body, 2 days lower body, 2 days cardio + rest day. Of course, he doesn't tell you much about form on each movement, or the benefit of using certain weight bearing exercises over others in producing functional strength safely instead of just pretty muscles and risking joint & ligament problems. All Phillips requires is that you reach some subjectively determined \\"level 10 output\\" of vague physiological description.<br /><br />The dietary plan is wonderfully rich in starches and sugars for the overweight person, increased consumption of which worked so well in addressing our nation's obesity problem over the last 3 decades, as you can read for yourself in USDA published material. Simply stay away from all that evil butter, cream, and animal tallows. After all, we see how rampant obesity and cardiovascular illness has become in people who eat these foods, such as the French, Masai, and Swiss, and how epidemic it was in the buffalo-eating Plains Indians before they were Westernized.<br /><br />Some of the \\"evidence\\" in the book is ridiculous, such as how the bear, an animal that gorges itself instead of grazing, is overweight and slothful. I would laugh myself into a seizure if I ever saw Bill P. try to take on a bear single-handedly or with a few of his bodybuilder friends. Has he ever watched a single nature show on the species? See one of those creatures run down a rabbit, hook a fish with its mouth or paw, jump, climb a tree, or swim a river and dare to tell yourself that it is an unfit animal. Naturally Phillips neglects to mention that cows, pigs, sheep, and poultry all follow the grazing style he suggests, but fail to assume the enviable physique of the stallion.<br /><br />And the crowning feature of \\"Body for Life\\" is \\"The Cheat Day.\\" On day 7 of the week, you get to eat whatever you want and park yourself in front of the TV with reckless abandon. This should clue people in to the truth about the regimen, that it is unnatural, uncomfortable, and a form of deprivation. Lasting success, as you can ask those who have kept off their weight, almost always involves slowly but surely changing your tastes and lifestyle habits to more healthful patterns. Phillips is promoting the failed \\"restrict/binge\\" approach, merely in a more structured way.<br /><br />To Phillips' credit however, he has managed to inspire several to pick their fat cabooses off the couch and \\"just say no\\" to Little Debbie's. Whether his bodybuilder lifestyle is going to work for everyone in the long term for achieving optimal health is another story. Regardless, all of this information is published on the web for free at bodybuilding.com and in far greater detail with pictures.<br /><br />I suppose this is the point in the negative review where you expect me to give you THE answer to weight loss. Sorry to disappoint, but I don't have one. My modest understanding of this topic leads me to believe that there are still too many unanswered questions and conflicting theories in human physiology and nutrition for a \\"one size fits all\\" approach. Almost everyone willing to offer you \\"your last diet\\" will feed you false premises unsupported by good science. Far better to listen to different experts, get yourself educated, use what works, and scrap what doesn't. Consulting a trusted doctor and/orpsychologist would be a great place to start since being overweight is also a medical issue.

It provides a verse by verse etymological breakdown of the original Sanskrit alongside a more readable composition. It is skewed, however, toward Hare Krishna beliefs<br /><br />Case in point. Take chapter 2 verse 72 of the original:<br /><br />\\"eSa brAhmIsthitih pArtha nainam prApya vimuhyati<br />sthitvAsyAmantakAlepi brahmanirvAnamrcchati.\\"<br /><br />This verse says (it's been a while, bear with me,) \\"That is 'Brahman-status', O' prince. After obtaining it, a person is not disoriented; the one who is situated in it even at end-time(?) does attain the 'Nirvana' that is 'Brahman'.\\"<br /><br />\\"Nirvana\\" that is \\"Brahman?\\" This is a radical syncretism of Buddhism and Hinduism deserving further analysis. Bhaktivedanta twists and smooths over the technical terms to come up with the homogenous spiritualism that goes like this: \\"That is the way of the spiritual and godly life, after attaining which a man is not bewildered. Being so situated, even at the hour of death, one can enter into the kingdom of God.\\"<br /><br />Another example comes in that same chapter, earlier in Verse 10, when Krishna is amused by Arjuna's sorrow born of spiritual ignorance, and begins the chief spiritual instruction. The word used to describe Krishna's initial reaction to Arjuna's woe is \\"prahasan\\" which clearly means \\"burst out laughing.\\" Bhaktivedanta renders it as \\"smiling,\\" evidently to make the divine interlocutor appear more compassionate. Anyone who's read more of the Mahabharata than the Gita knows that Krishna is not always a benevolent deity, even to those closely aligned with the Pandavas.<br /><br />This book is plainly a promotion of the Hare Krishna beliefs, and that'd be okay on its own terms, but the presentation offers specious objectivity by including the prominent apparatus criticus under the subtitle \\"As It Is.\\" The real Bhagavad Gita contains much greater philosophical and literary complexity than this sect's view does justice. It is a pastiche of multiple religious traditions and systems, and this interfaith character of the work probably has much to do with its enduring popularity in the Indian subcontinent. Pick up the Radhakrishnan or Edgerton translation if you want the readable and accurate work of an expert with a good introduction and one that is free from the heavy (mis)interpretation of this preachy tome. Barbara Miller's version is very good too, but so technical that I'd only recommend it as a third or fourth version.e religious traditions and systems, and this interfaith character of the work probably has much to do with its enduring popularity in the Indian subcontinent.

Bill Bryson sets out to describe all the landmark phenomena that led from the Big Bang to homo sapiens in readable science for the lay person. He does a good job bringing science to the benighted, but that's heavily dependent on just how many classes you slept through in high school or your college core curriculum. I am by no means as expert as any of the dozens of specialists in physics, chemistry, biology, geology, anthropology, and botany that Bryson used in researching and editing this book, but I thought a number of concepts (e.g. the definition of exponents and molten state of the earth's core) were too elementary to warrant inclusion in such a broad literary aim.<br /><br />The reader should be aware that Bryson is more interested in explaining \\"how we've come to know what we know\\" than in giving a straightforward list of the big discoveries. To this effect, he summarizes several biographies of varying depth on the major men (and few women) of science. I have little reference for the validity of most of these and so I trust his scholarship here. He has a charming way of writing about people and some of these sections are among the most memorable of the book.<br /><br />Some of the doomsday scenarios were duly unsettling to read, such as how likely a meteor might at any moment strike earth without warning as they soar through the solar system, and how the blast front would exceed the speed of sound, or how Yellowstone is one giant sleeper volcano just waiting to blow and cause awesome damage.<br /><br />To be quite honest, I give my rating of these popular science books based upon how memorable the content is, not for completeness. This sort of book is a pleasure read, but worth going through only once. If I ever wanted to learn more about DNA, Relativity, the earth's core, or isolation of chemical elements, I would go immediately to authoritative sources. I thought this book was fun, variably interesting, and a pleasantly fresh presentation.	2004-12-08

Thankfully, Rusten has done a very good job with the notes. At points I was hoping for more insight, and there are numerous references to Gomme's much fuller commentary where Rusten did not deem it worthwhile to spend anymore time.

The monumental feat of scholarship required to compile this resource is staggering to imagine. It has completely answered every query for which I have consulted it and deserves 5 stars for this fact alone.<br /><br />Nonetheless, it delivers in several other ways. The organization, which admittedly takes some getting used to due to such counterintuitives as the dual alphabetical ordering of the anusvara, turns out to be an extremely effective way of improving vocabulary because it groups several derivatives and compounds under their basic roots. Connections to other Indo-European cognates has the side effect of creating a work that is a valuable linguistic reference outside of ancient Indian studies.<br /><br />It is extremely comprehensive in certain entries, perhaps indeed encyclopaedaic as another reviewer mentioned, but this has its benefits. Sometimes readers need more background information on deceptively complex terms than provided in a particular piece of literature where the word is found, because the author assumes that his readers already possess this knowledge.<br /><br />As to the end product of the mammoth undertaking that this must have been for Monier-Williams, I have no complaints.

Hamel takes us on a whirlwind tour through ancient Attica not only through Neaira's eyes, but makes several stops along the way to explain customs and historical highlights of mid-late 5th and early 4th century Greece necessary to understanding the story. She crafts a satisfying introduction to ancient Greek social history<br /><br />I felt that the book was somewhat overhyped in the summary, as I was expecting to be treated to a climactic judicial clash, except that Hamel has all but exhausted the details of the court room drama in constructing Neaira's past, with little left for a grand finale. The verdict of the case is, alas, lost to the sands of time as well. I remember the book's dust jacket having printed on it something to the effect of \\"the author takes a sympathetic eye towards the protagonist.\\" This comes across strongly at times and  when Hamel made arguments from seemingly disparate, or lack of contrary evidence. But I suppose the occasional author bias is unavoidable when delving into specialized subject matter and drawing together so many tidbits of information into such a wonderful narrative.

Whiteley does an excellent job with the notes, although his dictionary appendix is too much of a crutch. Overly particularized definitions for some words are highlighted while more common meanings are omitted. It may not matter however, if the student is only interested in Latin as a hobby and not seeking full mastery.<br /><br />I would have made a number of different choices in punctuating the text given its intermediate level, but nothing too major.<br /><br />De Amicitia is not necessarily Cicero's easiest prose, but by no means his most difficult. It seems however, to avoid grammatical monotony, thus I find it a good text for acquainting intermediate students with a variety of possible constructions. The language of De Amicitia is not as highly nuanced as much of Cicero's other work, and in his preface, Cicero openly explains his stylistic intent. The subject matter is thought provoking, and the sentiments memorable, although perhaps a bit repetitive. I partake of the general consensus that Cicero was neither a first rate nor original philosopher, but that he was a very Roman one, and he had a unique talent for interpreting, comparing, and modernizing older ideas.<br /><br />I sense that Whiteley had very clearly in mind toward what kind of student he wanted to gear this book, and has produced a fine reader in which there are no significant flaws.	2004-12-04

Cicero's poetry is, honestly, not that good, but for such an important figure in the ancient world, this aspect of his writing undoubtedly needed scholarly analysis, and Ewbanks has done a great service to classics by taking care of it well enough for every conceivable purpose others in the field might have for this information.	2004-11-27

Edward Champlin compiles all the literary, legal, epigraphical, and papyrological sources evidencing the existence and/or content of a will and draws from these several important conclusions about who was leaving wills, what they left, to whom they left it, outside interference, and above all: the concomitant and often polarized forces of emotion and duty in the testator.<br /><br />The book was a pleasure to read, although several smaller issues which concern a scholar of Champlin's dedication to this specialty and his penetrating knowledge of Roman social history didn't really capture my interest regarding communal bequests and monuments. Chapter 1 was most interesting, with several juicy tidbits of Roman history that don't often make it into the textbooks, or which we simply overlook for the role which will-making had played in their unfolding.<br /><br />Reading critically, I think Champlin makes a few points for which he provides only some loaded literary evidence. I was hoping to see better documentation for these claims, which I think Champlin could have done, and an expanded appendix including legal sources of wills that he used would have been appreciated as well. A number of expert reviewers had remarked back during the book's initial publication, (and I agree with them to an extent,) that Champlin overly relies on Shaw and Saller's demographics to draw certain conclusions, because that data covers a much broader spectrum of Roman society than sampled in the primary sources Champlin was chiefly working with. Nonetheless, he is very precise about where he is applying such facts and figures in the text and it is not too pervasive.<br /><br />First finding, and then combing through these hundreds of anecdotes on wills and will making is really quite an impressive feat and this thorough analysis, I imagine, will hold indispensible value for anyone seeking to do further research in the field. \\"FInal Judgments\\" is wonderfully applicable focus to other areas of Roman studies, and quite an original one, though familiar enough to appeal to a substantially wide audience.other areas of Roman studies, and quite an original one, though familiar enough to appeal to a substantially wide audience.	2004-11-22

Caelio Oratio	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Austin's done a great job	The Pro Caelio is a somewhat complicated oration with its various references to lesser known people and incidents in the Late Republic. Austin attempts to reconstruct Caelius' life from the details. His commentary reveals a broad knowledge of Roman history and a sensitivity to the finer elements of Ciceronian rhetoric. My only criticism is his tendency to avoid commenting on some of the lengthier and more obscure passages by simply translating them straight through. It is often only a rare or highly informal definition which confuses the reader, such as the unexpected \\"Venerem\\" in section 52 which refers to a _statue_ of Venus.  I didn't like the unenlightening hunt through a colloquial rendition of a whole paragraph to disambiguate a single odd word. Punctuation was consistently excellent and the page by page app. crit. is always a plus.<br /><br />The \\"Pro Caelio\\" is one of Cicero's best speeches. His political career and energy for the courts were still very near their peak, and he had a personal ax to grind with the powers behind the plaintiff, who was a shill and a judicial featherweight. Cicero had the vastly superior talent and knew it, so he proceeded to rhetorically disembowel his opponents with style for the audience's delight. Since the disgruntled lawmen were missing the \\"ludi\\" because of state business, Cicero offered his own amusing theatrics. I'd like to believe Austin was right: (I can imagine the gentle headshakes and restrained chuckles on the faces of the tired judges) as Cicero launched into the lengthy prosopopoeia, this trial was just about a foregone acquittal.<br /><br />If you've ever harbored a guilty pleasure for reading the scandal mags but would like to do so with infinitely more educational value and style, pick up the Pro Caelio.	2004-11-22
US	34103525	RCIDJZ9F56RCK	0674616006	751789651	A New Introduction to Greek: Third Edition Revised and Enlarged	Books	4	34	34	N	N	A very good grammar	I was inducted into Greek through the Chase and Philips book in college under a knowledgeable instructor after having had much Latin, so perhaps my experience is not that of most readers. The book divides its content well, but chapter ordering could have been done differently. Out of 40 chapters, the Aorist passive and whole perfect system don't show up until 31 and 32 respectively and the relative pronoun is chapter 5's material. This is particularly problematic with the perfect system, because its morphology in Greek is highly irregular for several verbs and as introduced here, the reader has little regular practice before hitting literature. Imperatives and \\"eim'\\", \\"ei'mi\\", and \\"oida\\" are crammed in even later, creating the same problem. Nonetheless, paradigms and examples are abundant and clear. If I can find what I need in this book I will not bother to open Smythe.<br /><br />Vocabulary is kept at a minimum but the list selected is pretty good for jumping right into Plato, Xenophon, Euripides, Demosthenes, or most any other Attic author, which I think is good for a grammar when trying to lay down concepts efficiently. It would be nice to see an attendant reader like the Oxford course has for optional increased vocabulary learning.<br /><br />The Greek composition exercises really shouldn't be included. Chase and Phillips provide little if any instruction in writing Greek; you're meant just to guess it out from the grammar you learn with no explanation of style or common usage. I was assigned several of these in school and though I did well, suggestions from the teacher helped.<br /><br />The treatment of Greek conditionals is shaky. The most common forms are explained well, but there is no section developing a unified picture of them, nor a full explanation of the sequence of moods, and there may even be some direct omissions. Smythe's delineation and classification is far superior.<br /><br />There is no attention given to the Ionic or Doric dialects which compels me to advise against using this for anyone seeking foremost to pick up Homer, Herodotus, or the lyric poets if working entirely through self-study. This ia an ATTIC grammar: have no illusions about it.<br /><br />Having learned Greek through this text, I feel I cannot accurately compare it to any other grammars since I approach them with too much foreknowledge to judge their full pedagogical efficacy. New Introduction to Greek presents most concepts very lucidly, has excellent charts/graphs in each chapter and fine appendices. Under expert guidance it is a very approachable for the serious student and makes a handy quick-reference tool for many of the major areas of basic grammar.this for anyone seeking foremost to pick up Homer, Herodotus, or the lyric poets if working entirely through self-study.

I suspect the author had in mind Allen and Greenough's Latin grammar or H.W. Smythe's Greek grammar when designing the numeric scheme for each point, theme, and paradigm. It is a very useful system of notation for referencing from other works.<br /><br />I can't honestly see going through this lesson by lesson with most students who are not dedicated to long term research in the field and want to begin reading Sanskrit without learning every arcane morphological exception. This book serves as an indispensible reference work by including Vedic forms as well as accentation in the paradigms, which I would imagine is more authoritative than Coulson's simple rules. The book is long and comprehensive, and like Smythe and Greenough, has gained the respect of being \\"the\\" authoritative source. It is a wonderful book for learning troublesome concepts correctly and more fully than several of the shorter grammars treat them.	2004-09-29

If Cambridge has any claim to superiority over Oxford, its History of the Roman World is surely it. While the Oxford text is a horribly unchronological and unfocused mess, this text, (which is not only illustrated to a much greater extent,) provides a reasonably cogent summary of Roman history and highlights most of the important events, people, and themes. The chapters follow a roughly straightforward timeline, but any shortcoming here can be forgiven due to the excellent coverage of several dimensions of the Roman world such as scientific beliefs and progression, provincial territories, trade and agriculture, and military organization. Though the book is authored by several people, direct contradictions of fact are virtually non-existent. The numerous repetitions of certain points across chapters also serve helpfully as a key to their importance by depicting their impact in ways that other historical texts fail to do.<br /><br />As an anthology unfortunately, it still falls prey to the oddities of using several historiographical techniques to weave together a single tale. A number of the authors also emphasized some trends and turning points in history which were backed only by a couple or very few and unconvincingly important pieces of evidence whose weight a complete beginner might not be capable to judge for him/herself. I think the text is a fine introduction and could supplement even well-versed pundits with several tidbits. I would not however call this work a final authority on anything.	2004-09-28
US	34103525	R170UMXDAAYCAJ	0198721218	599184436	An Anthology of Latin Prose	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Good text for a sorely neglected pedagogical genre	It has always been my impression that (Cicero, Pliny, and Livy aside,) Latin prose often receives the short end of the stick when classics departments create their course offerings. It would be no wonder if this were true, for many people are attracted to the field in the first place by the beautiful poetry of Vergil, Catullus, Ovid, etc. A mastery of Latin literature however, is not attained without solid grounding in the prosaic tradition, which presents its own unique challenges and aesthetic.<br /><br />The book's introduction nicely acquaints the reader with the development of the genre and I thoroughly enjoyed the section on clausulae, which my teachers have rarely discussed, and some have outright dismissed. For the text itself, Russell has chosen some wonderful excerpts that sport both a wide range of authors across time periods with engaging content.<br /><br />I withhold a 5th star from this review only because Russell chose several selections for which his notes are too sparse for an introductory anthology reader. If I were to use this book with students at any level below undergraduate advanced Latin, I would have to expand the notes on just about every passage to make them manageable. And even then most students would have to work hard at it. This is not as user-friendly as Balme's \\"Intellegenda,\\" and it is hard to specify just what demographic Russell was shooting for. The included notes chiefly cover questions of historical reference and not the brain-busting grammatical convolutions and lengthy constructions that make Latin prose very troublesome for a neophyte.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this book for its quality selections and introductory sections. This is not a logical step for self-study if your only prose experience is slogging through a beginner's De Bello Gallico or a heavily annoted text with a specialized dictionary-appendix and a patient teacher. I would imagine however that any dedicated classics scholar, especially teachers, would be pleased to have this on his or her shelf.his on his or her shelf.	2004-09-28

I do not find its presentation difficult to understand, though it suffers from some poor organization. This book is obviously geared towards Indo-European philologists - not casual students of Gita. I very much enjoy that the bulk of examples are drawn from Sanskrit drama because the grammatical structures are generally more complex than those used in the sacred works and the vocabulary is far richer.<br /><br />It is my personal opinion that declensions should be learned one at a time with all case endings and that all denominatives should be grouped together for comparison. I also prefer that paradigms be written out in their entirety for all conjugations and declensions regardless of overlap if an index is to be useful; Coulson's is far too abbreviated and omits a number of forms altogether.<br /><br />Overall, I believe Coulson has made a significantly useful and original, albeit not easily accessible contribution to Sanskrit scholarship. This book would have been more effective if it had broken down concepts into smaller, more numerous chapters and provided a plurality of examples for each and every grammatical concept. It does not merit the label \\"Teach Yourself\\". This is a very worthwhile grammar for its unique approach and explanations. I would recommend it only to students interested in the language for its own sake, and when able to go through some Sanskrit alone with a dictionary. Once you learn the ins and outs of \\"Teach Yourself Sanskrit Complete Course\\", the text works nicely alongside with Whitney's verbal roots book for quicker form identification.	2004-09-26

Has and will continue to stand the test of time	Ayn Rand's novel has undoubtedly become a classic, enshrining her in the history of philosophy very prominently, for better or for worse. Believe it or not, (has this already been posted?) it came in 2nd only to the Bible in this Library of Congress survey of books that had made a difference in people's lives: loc.gov/loc/cfbook/booklists.html<br /><br />Criticisms of the book's length are not entirely unwarranted. Rand takes a while to finish the first act (Her endless scene setting goes on into triple digits of pages until she introduces Francisco d'Anconia,) and the long radio broadcast at the end was an unnecessary sledgehammer swung full force into a weakly opposing wall of socialist, mystical, and Judeo-Christian dogmas already imploding over its poorly laid foundations. The attacks on the simplicity of the characters however, are really out of line, since Rand \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" was designed to reach well beyond the simple novel.<br /><br />What I find most redeeming about Atlas Shrugged is its impassioned but well-reasoned defense of free market and self-affirming doctrines, regardless of their correctness. Too often as a college student did I see social welfare activists tear-jerk their way through debates with sub-par arguments, demonizing the opposition under the guise of honest and fair discussion. Rallies are chiefly held for 3rd World countries and the downtrodden and impoverished. After all, what's exciting to a young 20something about tax breaks? Can't the free market adherents fight back with their own panegyrics and vilifications if the dialogue has degenerated? Ayn Rand gave this voice to the industrialist, the entrepreneur, and the builder, reminding us that self-determination and private ownership are basic components of American mores and people have just as much right to fight for these things as everyone else does for their own cause in a democracy.<br /><br />That said, I'm not an Objectivist and find Rand's book an bizarre account of economic prediction. When I saw her interview with Mike Wallace it became clear that she could not answer some of his basic criticisms of her affinity for pure laissez faire. I doubt that a real economist would have done any less than disgrace her out-sized ego on that stage. Rand's work conveniently ignores several of the uglier snags of unrestrained market forces that our country has experienced firsthand. This is not the place to delve deeply into theory however, and her simplistic ideas do not really tarnish her moments of literary brilliance. Her attack on socialism was particularly poignant in the railroad bum's account of the fate of the Twentieth Century Motors Company, an image I will not soon forget.<br /><br />Atlas Shrugged has maintained a 4-star rating here after 1142 reviews, and I wager that they roughly comprise of 3/4 of the people giving it 5 stars out of admiration, and 1/4 giving it 1 star out of sheer disgust. Either way you slice it, it manages to say things that few other books have done, certainly not half so enduringly.her interview with Mike Wallace it became clear that she could not answer some of his basic criticisms of her affinity for pure laissez faire.

Many critics don't appreciate when they speak disparagingly of Huxley's predictions that he had written them in 1932. How different was the socio-cultural fabric of the \\"modern\\" world at that time! This rebellious icon undoubtedly overexaggerated - that was the point - but I doubt even HE suspected \\"Brave New World\\" would make him look this clairvoyant. None of his contemporaries would have guessed how close he came to modern genetic engineering, rampant SSRI and sedative use, sexual liberation, mass food fortification, and the direction public education is heading. Whether Huxley was a bitter intellectual who embraced counterculture only insofar as it got him attention is besides the point. Real 21st century life would be just as much \\"science fiction\\" to depression-era intellectuals, and he came a lot closer than Orwell or H. G. Wells.<br /><br />Huxley's writing is a little disconcerting at times, vacillating between different scenes of action without contextual or even speaker reference. At points it reads more like a screenplay, but these moments are not frequent and don't not interfere with clarity. His style is for the most part plain but sardonic, wholly suitable for satire. This was the darker (and first) counterpart to the \\"The Island,\\" which Huxley contended was an optimistic response to \\"Brave New World.\\"	2004-03-29

After thoroughly reading and rereading many sections, I can scarcely say I've gleaned anything close to that.<br /><br />The \\"chapters\\" read more like non-peer reviewed articles that are virtually impossible to understand for the casual reader, and very difficult for classics students. They constantly diverge from their central theses, lack chronological sequence both within themselves and in relation to other chapters, use highly colloquial terms and accentuate seemingly arbitrary themes throughout history while ignoring others.<br /><br />Cases in point: Marius' name is mentioned about 3 times, and never in regards to his own exploits. Cinna is missing entirely as far as I can tell. The Catilinarian conspiracy receives about half a paragraph (even though Sallust devoted a book to it and Cicero couldn't shut up about his own involvement), as do the Gracchi brothers, and Cato the Elder, but we receive heaps of names about obscure groups in the Italian peninsula during Rome's expansion, whose importance as individual tribes is obfuscated by varying levels of information which seem to lead nowhere, while their individual legacies are absent. The exact identities of  \\"Roman\\", \\"Etruscan\\", \\"Latin\\", and \\"Italian\\" are anyone's guess. When the political division between the \\"populares\\" and \\"optimati\\" are introduced, the latter term is left undefined. Very, very shoddy.<br /><br />I have not read the Greek section yet and refrain from commenting upon it.<br /><br />The Roman section of this text, I think, is a disgrace to the Oxford University Press. If you want to learn about classical history, I suggest you read an array of entries from the Oxford Classical Dictionary, a thick but condensed reference work that cuts through much of the subjective interpretation of events to the meat of the matter, giving you the \\"who's who\\" and \\"what's what\\" in concise entries.n concise entries.	2004-02-22

This is my favorite book on carbohydrate metabolism, and Dr. DesMaison's approach could probably be adapted to layperson literature on several health topics. Most other books consist of listening to an \\"expert\\" sitting on a high perch trying to push readers on a narrowly track toward \\"perfect health\\" without any room for divergence, totally insensitive to real physiological differences. People need to be empowered with knowledge of the causes and effects of their health problems. DesMaison preserves the complexity of the concepts but in uncomplicated language that does not shy away from technically important details which may be critical to improved health. Several other books allow self-help gobbledygook to seep into the science or confuse the reader with conflicting facts, but not this one. I've yet to see another program that actually discourages giving up an addictive behavior whenever one feels able because a premature withdrawal might trigger a brain chemistry imbalance.<br /><br />DesMaisons recommends a slow and steady recovery from carbohydrate binging with an unorthodox albeit sound and practical nutritional approach. Hundreds will attest to _long term_ success. The 7 step program is not arbitrary and has undergone revision based on public feedback and continued research. The best part is that no one is held to a schedule. It's sort of like nutritional karate: a person advances to the next level when ready and no sooner, when he/she can benefit it. There are no induced starvations, and no promises of quick success. I don't rigidly follow the program (no longer need to) but the general idea, and several tips and tricks I've picked up, are still at the core of my eating principles.<br /><br />Most of the naysayers who have posted bad reviews here clearly reflect a poor understanding of the program and one wonders if they actually read the book, let alone applied its suggestions. SATRP relies on a mild but effective method that encourages listening to bodily feedback and helping the reader interpret various reactions.
