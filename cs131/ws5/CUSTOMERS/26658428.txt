Unfortunately, it had to be a romance novel that left me with a bad taste.  I didn't know what to make of this christian romance or should we just call it a romance novel, because most of the sex scenes would cause the most holy christians to backslide. <br /> <br />The novel is based on a church called Red Oaks Christian Fellowship located in Macon, Georgia.  The stories are based on particular members' lives.  The mother of the church, Mother Maybelle, is a lonely, nosey, gossiping, busybody that has had five husbands and no biological children. She reminds me of the woman at the well when Jesus asked her where was her husband and the woman responded that she had none. Jesus said you have said well that you have none because you have had FIVE husbands.  Just like Maybelle.  Mother Maybelle married five rich men and they all died.  I wonder if she's killed them off? I wouldn't put it pass her. She seemed like the type to do such a thing with her lavish lifestyle.  Now that story alone would make a great read of a novel. <br /> <br />The review is long because it's an anthology of four stories. So to summarize the short end: <br /> <br />1. A Love Supreme by Janice Sims:  Churchgoing landscape owner, Alex Cartwright meets handsome business owner, Jared Kyles. Alex gets him to do something that he hadn't done in years---go to church.  Naturally, they fall in love, but not before they make passionate love and then have the audacity to attend church the next morning with no sense of repentance.  This story was the second best of the anthology.  <br /> <br />2. Love and Happiness by Kim Louise:  The third better story in the anthology.  Anti-church goer, Renata Conner falls in love with church-going Devin McKenna. Renata is the founder of a non-profit organization that helps wayward children. She seeks Red Oaks financial assistance in helping to keep the agency opened. The busybody, Mother Maybelle, decides that Brother McKenna needs a wife, so she sends him over to the non-profit organization to interview Renata to see if her company is a match for Red Oaks to help. They are attracted to each other, but it becomes rocky.  Eventually, they work out their problems, thanks to Mother Maybelle, and fall in love. <br /> <br />3. A Love Like That by Natalie Dunbar is the better story of all.  Even though it was the least edited, (more errors than I care to mention, but that's BET for you), it was the most favorable story.  Dominique Winston, born into a lap of luxury, meets racing car driver Blair Thomas.  They meet at the church's Men's Day picnic where Dominique was a member and a volunteer of the event.  Blair was just passing through the city and was invited by a friend to attend.  This time, the pastor of the church, Rev. Avery, is the matchmaker of this pair, but he does it with finesse, unlike Mother Maybelle.  When things start to turn shaky, here comes Mother Maybelle to the rescue to patch up the broken pieces.  Dominique and Blair falls in love, hoping to have a lasting, happy marriage just like Dominique's parents. <br /> <br />4. Love Under New Management by Nathasha Brooks-Harris.  Last and definitely least of the anthology. This story dragged on and on. Choir soloist, Valerie Freeman, joins Red Oaks and falls in love with dreadlock wearing choir director, Norman Grant, who happens to be Mother Maybelle's foster son and the most eligible bachelor in the church. Valerie is hurt over a past relationship and doesn't know how to let go and trust again. Norman has to use all of his tactics, along with the help of Mother Maybelle, to get Valerie to marry him.  One thing I must say about this author is that she set some very visual chuch sermon scenes. I thought I was sitting in one of the pews. However, there was a sex scene that could have put the X-Rated author ZANE to shame.  I was shocked to read how these two church going folks, not to mention being the choir director and his leading lady singer, could so easily make passionate love and attend church the next morning with no sense of repentance.  As a matter of fact, you will find this sort of behavior in all four stories.  It seemed that no one felt any sense of remorse or sorrow for their sins of lust and fornication.  It appeared to be the norm in their church. It makes me wonder what Rev. Avery is preaching about--money or the salvation of souls? It left me with a sense of thinking that all of the couples' sentiments were exactly the same:  \\"Before we get married, we gotta see if we're sexually compatable first.\\" <br /> <br />If you are one of those \\"Saints\\", then you wouldn't want to read this, but if you are one of those \\"Aints\\", then you can identify.  This is a 2.8 on the SmithScale. <br /> <br />	2005-04-02

As you can see from my reviews, I rarely give 4 or 5 star reviews.  In order to get that high mark, your story has got to be different, unique and unusual.  This was an unusual story.  Unusual because for a person like Shorty, a hard-type street guy, to turn around and become a member of the clergy, was a different twist.  I didn't think he would go out like that until I read how devoted he was to his best friend's sister.  Right then and there, I saw how he was turning soft (a woman has the power to do that to a hard man...if she know's what she's doing).  So okay, it was kinda written in a \\"Dick and Jane\\" type read (sorry Carl); but now no one can accuse the brother of not understanding the storyline.  See, I knew there was a reason he wrote it that way (LOL).  But I give it a 4 stars on the SmithScale because it was a quick read with a different and unique plot.  I like the fact that he brought closure to the story so that we can use our own imagination as to how their lives all turned out.  I love church drama novels because they tell the truth and you can learn from them.  Good job, Carl.	2005-02-04
US	26658428	R8UZW26VO5G11	0743477146	675408189	Let the Church Say Amen	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Behind the Scenes	Even though I enjoyed reading this, it could have been a terrific novel if the storyline had not been so typical.  To sum it all up:  Big time preacher who is on the edge of expulsion from his church has sisters that has the hots for him and his  sweet, adorable, yet sickly wife is tolerant; oldest son strung out on drugs; daughter has two illegitimate children with different baby daddies who is derangely in-love with the last child's father who is about to marry someone else; younger college graduate son is expected to follow in father's footsteps but turns out to get \\"turned out\\" on the down low; pastor-father faces expulsion from his church; sisters in the church has eyes for pastor.  The confrontation scenes at the weddings of the daughter's baby daddy and the perpetuating marriage of the younger son are farfetched,  outrageous and unbelievable.    Since there are only a handful of AA authors who writes in this new genre of church drama novels or Christian Drama as it's called (Bowen, Monroe, Roby, Tate-Billingsley, Weber), this novel is a welcoming addition, and if you enjoy reading church/family drama as much as I do, then I'd say read this one.  You'll enjoy it.  A 3.5 on the SmithScale.	2005-02-03

It is an annointed book filled with pages driven by the Holy Spirit.  Many women will not come to terms with this book because they are not ready to give their all to their husbands or God.  I agree with the chapters in this book because it agrees with the word of God.  This is not a book about giving and receiving or money cometh to me, or name it and claim it.

This was not a good book.  It's not even an average book.  I'd say that it is rather a disappointing book.  I am not impressed with Ms. Roby's writing.  She's an average writer -- nothing to get all hyped about.  In the past, she tells the same old boring stories that have been told over and over again. But to her credit, she did bring out a new fad in \\"teen phone sex.\\"  It would be nice to hear some new stories from fresh voices.  Naturally, Terri Mc is the girl.  By the way, where's she been hiding?  Isn't it about time we hear from her again?  Also, newcomer R.M. Johnson is a delightfully fresh new voice.	2004-03-15

I can't even imagine people giving a man that much power.  But i know that there are preachers everywhere who use the gospel to benefit their own lustful desires.<br />The daughter was suppose to be only 14 years old, but she sometimes speaks like a 25 year old.<br />The book opened with interest and had a steady pace, then during the Easter sermon, it started to become a slow read but then picked back up again.  <br />Unfortunately, this book was too predictable which limited the excitment.  The storylines were all too familar.  It was like I read them somewhere before.  But I'm glad that this author has exposed these crooked, loud-mouthed false prophets and prophetesses.  You know who they are.  I know who they are.  They know who they are.  Satan knows who they are because he sent them.  And most importantly, God knows who they are and he'll deal with them.<br />We need courageous authors who are not afraid to step up to the plate and call a spade a spade.	2004-02-25

The author fell in love with a man who had a past.  A past prison term.  He didn't know which was worst -- being locked up inside prison walls, or being locked up inside himself.

This author is among that percentage.  This story moves in too many directions.  The story is old and stale.  There was nothing new learned from it.  Grant it, novels are supposed to be entertaining, but also filled with education and enlightenment and maybe even encouragement.  It was missing in this story.  Why Sleeping Dogs Lie is a bad attempt at soap operatic.  I couldn't recommend this one.	2004-02-02

Here is yet another Christian romance novel on the story of forgiveness.  Some of the dialogues were flat and lifeless with no feeling.  I found it distasteful and insensitive that the two mothers, especially Jessi's mom, were arguing while Jessi was lying on her deathbed.  The front cover is appealing, but the characters are somewhat underdeveloped.  The story moves slow, but it can be read relatively quickly. It was an okay read as far as Christian love stories go, and very predictable.  It kind of reminded me of a Cinderalla story...and they lived happily ever after.  This is pure fiction romance and not a true to life novel.  I'm glad the author brought closure to the characters because a sequel would be overkill.  All in all, for a debut novel, FLAG was a courageous effort.	2003-11-30

Cheating on your spouse is truly difficult to forgive.  Look at it like this:  In this day and time, one could contract AIDS or another STD.

Poor Proofreading	I could not believe this book was written by Lolita Files after reading her other novel which was written no where near this level!  The writing in this book was awesome!  It's obvious that she has an excellent editor!  Whomever the editor is---hats off to you!  On the other hand, however, there were many typographical errors.  But gripping and compelling, to say the least.  However, I'm still not sure who is the actual main character of this book.  I love the voice of Lay---very realistic for that time (and this).  I could see Ice Cube playing this role.  The story of incest was graphic and regurgitating.  It wasn't like they didn't know that they were related is what makes it puke-sickening.  This story was overwhelmed or overboard with incest, murders and house fires.  It seems like the author has taken several previously written books/movies and created this story.  In this novel, you will hear voices from \\"The Color Purple,\\" scenes from \\"Boys N The Hood,\\" and characters from \\"Beloved.\\" I found it unusual for a father AND his two sons to all have been homosexuals.  Homosexuality is not hereditary as the author may suggest.  It is a chosen lifestyle.  None of the characters seemed to have found redemption in their lives and since the story is being told by a fourth/fifth generation voice whose own life has yet to be told, this leads me to believe that a sequel is soon to follow.  I give it a 3.5 stars for the overall storyline, but a 5 star rating for the editing.  Ms. Flies you should stick with this editor---she'll take you places.	2003-11-19

I think the book could have been better written -- dialogues and all.  A soror sister in the ATL sent me this book and I cannot endorse it to my soro sisters in San Diego.  I understand the author wanting to climb the band wagon along with E. Lynn, Marcus Major, Carl Webber, R.M. Johnson, Michael Baisden and such likes, but he has a long way to go.  This is one of those stories that nearly every ex-married person can relate.  Unfortunately, there is nothing unique about his.  My advice to the author and those who suffer heartache and pain:  Turn all your cares over to God because he cares for you.  You may or may not find temporary relief in white pages and black ink---but you will definitely find permanent relief in Christ Jesus.	2003-11-06

This story is so slow and the author repeats the same things over and over again.  Another thing is that black people do not talk like the characters the author is portraying.  This is a good book title, but it needs another storyline with stronger black characters that don't pretend to sound white.  Sad to say, I could not finish this book because it was going in circles.  I skimmed through it and of course, predictability was inevitable. The main character, Jake, really was not what one would call a &quot;prodigal husband.&quot;  Thomas should have made his character more like the prodigal son of the Holy Bible. Jake didn't do enough dirt to be considered a prodigal husband.<br />I'd like to see Terri MacMillan or Sister Souljah rewrite this story using the same title, or perhaps a strong contemporary christian fiction writer could rewrite it.<br />I love christian fiction, but I wasn't feeling this story at all.	2003-10-31

County &quot;scoffed.&quot;  Briscoe or her editor should have used a thesaurus.  This word had to literally appear on nearly ever page.  After having read &quot;scoffed,&quot; for the fifth time, all times after that, I jerked because it was just getting on my nerves.<br />Peyton Place and The Return of Peyton Place are classical stories written in the 60s and there is no story that can compare to it.  Peyton Place, although, can be credited for such successful night time soaps such as &quot;Dallas,&quot; &quot;Knots Landing,&quot; &quot;Falcon Crest,&quot; and &quot;Dynasty.&quot; <br />P.G. County is just another drama filled story of not so &quot;every-day&quot; black folks.  I thought the story was written nicely, and naturally, as with any novel, it has it's boring moments and starts out slow because the reader has to get to know the characters.  It takes some time to get to know characters in books, unlike a movie, you can get to know them immediately.  The end was somewhat outrageous.  It seemed like the author wanted to bring closure on everything in her ending chapter which made it look &quot;rushed along.&quot;  Actually, she should have brought closure about Candice during the moment when she called her family meeting.  Barbara should have bought closure to her situation when she first suspected Jolene.  The only situation that should have taken place in the last chapter should have been Lee's discovery of her dad.  There were really no true &quot;heroins&quot; in the book.  This is good because it lets you know that a sequel will follow.<br />Overall, the story was written from a &quot;white&quot; perspective (i.e, &quot;wanna-be-white&quot;).  Face it.  Even highly successful black folks still talk and entertain in black fashion---not white.	2003-10-27

I also really don't like Christian fiction romances because they are boring and drawn out, but this novel is unlike any other Christian romance book that I have read.  True enough it is a story about faith, trust and love, but it should be named something like &quot;That Airline,&quot; because that is where her heart lead her to find true romance (and let me tell you that he was a GOOD find).  But from the beginning, Marley had suspicions about her fiance.  The book was predictable but it was a quaint story.  MaGrand was a big hit. She was one grandmother who spoke from her fists--and if the punch landed on your face--then so be it.  Marley's friends fitted in the story as fill-ins.  Christian romance writers need to use this book as a model.  Jamellah Ellis kept it real and exciting.  I recommend this book to all Christians especially women and non-Christian women.	2003-09-13
