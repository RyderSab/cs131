Following in the footsteps of Stephen Covey, Deepak Chopra and Wayne Dyer, he has abandoned legitimate science and moved into the touchy-feely realm of self-help psychology, by appealing to people's thirst for easy answers to difficult life problems.  Having been down that road many times with the aforementioned authors, I suggest avoiding said road like the plague!  Life does not offer easy answers.  Changing attitudes and behavior is hard work, and anyone who tells you otherwise is a charlatan.   <br /> <br />By contrast, Dr. Aaron Beck, the founder of Cognitive Therapy, is a brilliant scientist - I repeat, SCIENTIST - who built a school of psychology one brick at a time - through careful research and testing.  Dr. Beck NEVER gave people a false sense of optimism.  Seligman on the other hand wants to reap the rewards and achieve celebrity by appealing to people's mania for easy answers.	2004-12-16
