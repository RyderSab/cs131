But the hero is the one whom you feel so much for because he is a man caught up (as are a lot of men) in trying to do the right thing.  But also not to let anyone know how much he feels and how deeply.  He has been hurt but heals and is unhappy but becomes happy.  Read it you can't miss.

The only problem I had with it, as in other books, is that I cannot believe any woman likes being beaten.  That pain would turn anyone on is beyond me.  But since I have read so much about the canings and beatings I believe it does happen.  I also liked the fact she was having sex with three men at once instead of being afraid to be herself.  After reading the Story of O, which disgusted me because of her submission, I found this refreshing.	2002-10-31

It was rather stale. The woman who replaces his wife's body was an unattractive middle ager.  She acted like she was afraid of something or someone throughout the book.  The wife was just mean and you could have no sympathy for her.  The hero was delightful and deserved better than either one of them.  Some how you can't just see the two of them living happy every after.  There is no love in this story and very little erotica.  People read Schone for the sex not a bad plot.

He cares more for her than himself.  He is also a sad lonely person and it made me want to cry at how such a kind man man being treated that way by society.  I know they will have a happy life together along with her two boys.  Her husband is cruel and so are her parents.  They deserved more than what they got.

You feel so sorry for the poor man who is trapped and only used over the centuries for sex.  Most men's fantasies.  But I could relate as no one every saw him as a real person with feelings.  He is surprised when the heroine doesn't demand sex from.  It has a nice ending.  I will re-read.	2002-09-17

However, I read this one about the first twin and it was boring to me and not as sexy.  I read the reviews on the next book on the second twin and it was so bad I didn't buy it.  So if we could go back to some more sexy Cynster men I would read all of them.	2002-09-17

In reality noone could withstand this kind of pain.  I then to think the author tried to make out like that got such pleasure from this beast.  Also books that just beat over and over again get boring.	2002-09-17

It is her usual romantic love story.  I loved his character.  Didn't like her as well.  But there is a lot of great sex and sexy men.  One thing I like about all the Cynsters is when they do decide to make a commitment they stay true to their spouses.  This is probably an unreality at that time but is nice to dream about.	2002-09-17

When I started this book I was hooked.  The Carpathian males are real.  Not Vampires.  The love they have for each other is sizzling.  Also the sex.  I won't give away the end of the story though.  I have read all of Christine's books except the unpublish Lair of the Lion.  She is an exceptional writer and the fact she can get her mind around all of this stuff is interesting in itself.  These are some of the sexiest men I have ever read about and I read six to eight books a week.	2002-09-17

I agree with someone that I got a little tire of hearing about the Dutch Cup and prevent pregnancy in this day and age.  But it had plenty of sizzling sex and erotica.  I will re-read it again.	2002-09-13
US	40462350	R1SAVKQ9YBMJ76	1562011219	436581304	Max	Books	1	1	2	N	N	Max	This is without a doubt the worst book I have ever read.  There is nothing to it.  All it is about is teenage girls getting beaten.  To the point that if it ever happened that would probably be dead.  There is not sex just one rape.  Then the last fifteen girl is beaten until they kill her.  This is not enjoyable reading nor anything sexual.  Even a men would not be interested in abusing teenage girls unless they are really sick.  This is the first book by Richard Manton I have read and will be the last.	2002-08-27
