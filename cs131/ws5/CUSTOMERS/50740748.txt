I liked the relationship between the hero and heroine.  I subtracted two stars because, unlike some other reviewers, I felt that the book was written with modern sensibilities in mind.

This book is the sequel to &quot;Who's The Boss&quot; which I read just before reading this book.  I think that by reading &quot;Who's The Boss&quot; first, it gave me a better understanding of the people involved in &quot;The Brennan Baby&quot;.<br />I thought that the heroine, Gillian, was very believable as a young woman who had been emotionally damaged by an extremely deprived childhood. Unlike her real life counterpart she found love and healing in the form of Devon who is a playboy with his feet on the ground.  He is an orthopedic surgeon in residency at the same hospital that Gillian is employed.<br />This is a quick and satisfying read that I recommend if you're not looking for something deep and time consuming.	2000-12-21

I've liked some others of hers better such as &quot;A Treasure Worth  Seeking&quot;.  I think that Hunter fell in love with Kari too quickly.  It  wasn't realistic.  However, I did like the secondary couple (Bonnie and  Pinkie) and their romance.  They were more believable and I think that most  of us have met people like them at one time or another in our life.  Read  the book if you're on a plane, train or bus (or have kids bugging you)  otherwise find a book with more meat and depth to it.	2000-09-05

The blurb on the back cover says:  &quot;Fortune McQueen grew up in the North Carolina wilderness, the  daughter of trappers who'd saved her from the savages who murdered her  mother.  The mountain men were Fortune's only family--until Kane Warrick  claimed her as the granddaughter of an English lord.  Suddenly, she found  herself heir to the family mill now in the greedy clutches of her evil  cousin Manville! With proper clothing and gentle instruction from Kane,  Fortune blossomed into a beautiful lady.  But the innocent lass had much to  learn about civilization...and men.  Some men, she soon discovered, could  be ruthless and dangerous.  While others, like Kane Warrick, could set her  heart beating in the most unsettling of ways....&quot; This book is a light  and uncomplicated read.  There were times that I just shook my head at the  trusting naivete of the h/h when presented with some situations.  And I was  astonished at their choice of action at the end of the book given the  circumstances they were under.	2000-08-30

I think that there were some aspects that could have been developed  further; such as exploring the trauma that Rule had suffered in Vietnam.   It has been my experience that when most men go through a war (particularly  hand-to-hand combat) it affects them deeply.<br />However both protagonists  seemed to handle their reactions and emotions in a realistic manner.  Rule  was strong, hardworking, determined, and a perfect foil for Cathryn who  needed the strength that he offered.  At the end she developed strength of  her own and he discovered that he needed her more than she would have  believed.<br />All in all this is a satisfying book and I do recommend it.	2000-08-20

I don't give too many books five stars but I couldn't see any other way around it.  Not only did L. Howard write an entertaining story, but she  created a nearly flawless hero, even though he was by no means perfect.

But in this case  perseverance paid off.  She won the (sigh) hero.<br />If I had any complaints,  it would be that the book could have been a wee bit longer.  I would have  liked Faith to be able to find her mother and the rest of her family even  though they had not been good to her.  And for us to be there for the  wedding would have been nice.<br />If you have not read this book, I do  recommend it.	2000-08-17

It is the first book that I've read by this author.  I don't know what to  think.  The hero (?) acted like such a jerk throughout most of the book.   He may have been the epitome of virility but he had no other redeemable  qualities.  It was often hinted that his cynical attitude was because of  his childhood but the reader was never told what his childhood was like  beyond the fact he was often ignored by his wealthy parents.<br />The heroine  was somewhat more realistic in that she let her heart lead her into what  seemed to be a one sided love affair.  I say realistic because I have seen  so many young women fall in love with men who they think will change their  ways.  I'm not saying that it is sensible.<br />But it's not realistic for him  to change on the last page and the reader leave with the feeling of a  &quot;happy ever after&quot;.<br />Needless to say I am not going to keep this  book to re-read at some later date.	2000-08-10

The series tell the story of five sisters who start  out very poor and through circumstances their lives are changed  dramatically.<br />The blurb on the back cover says:  &quot;Playing the  charming heartbreaker--risky, elusive, and trouble where women were  concerned--was completely out of character for Slade Ramsey, but when his  fiancee threw him over, he'd rebounded by shedding his nice guy image and  seducing Shavonne Brady on a trip to her West Virginia town.  She'd fallen  hard, in love for the first time, and something in him had shattered when  he'd left her crying two long years ago.  Now he'd returned to confess what  he couldn't forget, to exorcise the memories of his betrayal--and to earn  her trust by sharing a family secret that would set her free.  Shavonne  didn't want him back, to be rendered vulnerable by passion and need, but  she was helpless under the sensual assault of Slade's hunger for her.  She  had to know his promises this time were truly vows of love, but would  denying her desire bring him closer or push him away forever?&quot;<br />I  liked this series and if you're not looking for anything too complicated,  you may too.	2000-08-04

Then sweet, serene Erin Brady came tantalizingly near--and he  felt his cherished control slipping.  He usually chose a dazzling spitfire  he could battle and vanquish, but when this soft-eyed temptress treated him  like Sir Galahad, he felt a sudden, wild longing to free the passionate  woman inside her.  Erin had never known the fiery thrill of seduction, to  be claimed by a powerful sensual man, but Rad's touch awakened a siren who  would be satisfied with nothing less.  Challenged by her tenderness,  astonished by the protective instincts she aroused in him, Rad tried to  drive Erin away, sure he'd bring her nothing but sorrow once she knew his  secrets.  Could the woman who'd found joy in his arms teach him the healing  power of love?&quot;<br />Like the others in this series, it is a pleasant  story with a predictable outcome.	2000-08-04

She is the fourth youngest Brady girl to have her story told.

She'd come all the way to Buffalo to escape her overprotective,  matchmaking family in Texas, winning the writing job she'd always wanted.   But no one had warned her she'd been hired to help a bad-tempered, cynical  ex-ball player--an unnervingly virile heartbreaker who found her romantic  inexperience a challenge.  Jack did his best to discourage Colleen, to  drive her away...until he needed her help in a charade to persuade his  mother he'd finally fallen for a nice girl.  Colleen knew they were  playacting, that Jack was only pretending desire, but why did his kisses  scorch her lips?  She'd always been so proper, waiting for a man she loved  to awaken her passion, but Jack's touch left her aflame with need...and  desperate to run wild with him.

Actually this book is not about any of the Brady  sisters.  It tells the story of Vanessa, the spoiled sister to two of her  brothers who each married a Brady.  Do you follow me?<br />The blurb at the  back of the book says: &quot;Wealthy and beautiful Vanessa Ramsey was used  to men chasing her, throwing themselves at her feet--and she'd earned her  reputation as a vixen no man could tame.  But when her father made Lincoln  Scott an offer he couldn't refuse, she was the prize he'd have to win!   Linc found the dazzling temptress with fire in her eyes a delectable  challenge, but having a man--even one with dreamboat looks--chosen for her  made Vanessa burn with fury...and with white-hot  passion.  She'd never let  a man know her secrets or touch her heart, but Linc's fierce caresses and  his refusal to fight with her left her vulnerable, and freed the yearning  woman behind the glittering facade.  Linc knew her mind was full of him,  her body flushed and feverish because of him, but Vanessa insisted they  were too mismatched for love to last.  Could he teach the spirited heiress  with the smoldering temper that she was loved for herself  alone?&quot;<br />This book can be read by itself but I think that if you can  obtain all five books of the series, it will be more enjoyable.  Many of  the same people appear in all the books.	2000-08-04

US	50740748	R1P9KLIIARMEWE	1551664321	923891735	All That Glitters	Books	4	6	14	N	N	Culture Clash!	After reading all these reviews, I wonder if we read the same book.  I did not find the hero to be abusive.  Controlling, yes.  He was raised in a culture where males are the definite heads of their households; he was very  handsome, extremely rich and I'm sure used to having willing women at his  beck and call.  So, when from the very beginning, the heroine tried to make  it clear that she wanted nothing to do with him, he was frustrated and  challenged, so he came on rather strong.<br />The heroine was emotionally  immature, evidentally from having married a much older man who apparently  protected her from life's rough edges.  So she lacked the experience of  dealing with a man like the hero.  On top of it all, she was attracted to  him, much to her chagrin.  I will say that she did cry much too much and  much too often.  Ultimately, she had to decide if she wanted to be with him  enough to give up her independence to live in the patriarchal society in  which he lived.  The hero had a very gracious mother who had been married  to a man much like her son and was able to give the heroine some very wise  advice.<br />I would have given this book five stars except for what the  author didn't tell us.  It had great sexual tension  but when it came to  the wedding night, it was behind closed doors and subsequent scenes were  brief and uninformative.  It was a letdown in that respect.  Otherwise it  would have been a keeper.	2000-07-26

I believe it is the worst hurricane ever to   hit the United States as far as the loss of human life is calculated.	2000-07-25

I had heard so much about her so I thought I'd give this book a try.  I chose this one even though I have others by her, because it was not part of a  series.<br />I wish I could say that I liked it as well as so many others did  but I was disappointed.  Oh, it had some really steamy scenes all right and  I would have kept the book for those scenes alone if the h/h hadn't been so  annoying.  The heroine had been so independent for so long that it was  second nature to her.  While young she wouldn't ever take the advice of her  father so he basically gave up and let her do as she pleased which was  hinted at to include taking lovers.  And so many people that they came in  contact with did not censure her for it which was not realistic for the  times.<br />And the hero was so adoring of her and (trying to put myself in a  males place) I couldn't see where her blatantly forward sexuality deserved  his adoration.  Realistically, he would have taken what she offered and  left without looking back.<br />Also, running true to form, she didn't take  his advice either and he was almost killed trying to save her.  The fact  that the author made it look like she was being heroic doesn't offset the  fact that if she hadn't disobeyed, he may very well have gotten away with  less injury.<br />Never the less, I will read some more books by this author  and hope that I will enjoy them more.	2000-07-23

Brandewyne and of all the 15 books of her's that I went on to read, it remains my favorite.  It was a keeper for me. This book was written 20 years ago and many of today's  sensitive readers would not like this book because of the strong and  sometimes harsh storyline. The hero was a man to read about and to dream of  but one would not want to be married to him in reality.  He's not a man you  can wrap around your little finger. If this were a contemporary novel, I  would agree with the reviewer just below.  However, in those days, there  were no women's shelters.  You had to rely on yourself, your family and  whatever resources that were available to you; which was few if you lived  in the isolated estates that were common to these types of historical  romances.	2000-06-19

It was a nice book, particularly for young people or people who like their romances uncomplicated.  At times there was a lot of detailed description of  relatively minor details.  There was also a mystery involving an estate and  some hidden emeralds.  Theodora (according to the conditions of her  cousin's will) was to live at the estate along with a very handsome distant  relative for six months.  In that time they had to either marry (not  necessarily each other) or find the emeralds.  If the conditions were met  they would then inherit the estate.  However, until the end the reader  didn't know which man the heroine would agree to marry.  I was pleased to  see that it was the man that I was rooting for throughout the book.

I gave it only four stars because toward the end of the book, when the heroine is brought (captured) to a mideastern island, we are asked to believe that even though  she did not speak the language, important conversations were carried on  around her so that she understood them.  And she was being groomed to  impersonate another woman.  Her accent alone would have given her away.  In  spite of that flaw, it went to my keeper shelf.  WARNING: for those who are  disturbed by such things; it was written in the seventies and features a  number of rapes.  This book may be hard to find.	2000-05-09

The hero and heroine went through so much, yet their love remained strong.  If you can find it I recommend your  reading It.	2000-04-15
