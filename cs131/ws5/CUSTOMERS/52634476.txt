This book, these books A Time to Hate and A Time to Love are my kind of Star Trek books.  In these two books the problem to be solved or the story if you will is secondary to the interaction between the characters. The story story itself is engaging but its Riker's relationship with his father,with Deanna, Crusher's thinking about her offer to head starfleet medical and LaForges ingenuity in solving his problem and Picard's continuing difficulties that carries the story for me. I definately recommend them for you to read	2004-07-05

This story picks up where John Vornholts &quot;A Time to&quot; books leave off.   The opening set during the time of Archers Enterprise and we see some nicely written scenes involving characters from that era and it sets up the rest of the book.  Jump to 2378 and Picards time and we find he and the crew of the Enterprise E sent into relatively uncharted space to investigate message probes sent from a civilization whos world was about to be destroyed.  They arrive there without incident and find the survivors living on asteroids. The Enterprise capabilities are hampered by extreme radiation so the crew must do more on site work to find out how things work for the survivors.  They encounter opposition who much to their surprise are using pre federation weapons and Klingon weapons.  There is also a spy on the Enterprise.  There are nice continuity bits through out the book.  The characters ring true. It is easy to visualize them when reading the book.   I look forward to the remaining book that will finish the story.  Its easy to see these authors are fans as well as good story tellers.	2004-04-05

This book features Uhura as the 100+ year old head of Starfleet Intellegence who receives word from an old contact in the Romulan Empire that there is a deadly virus spreading across the quadrant that threatens all civilization.  Uhura enlist the services of Benjamin Sisko, Tuvok, Dr Selar, Beverly Crusher and Dr. McCoy to track down the source of and cure for the disease.  Another featured character is Zetha who is a Romulan and delivered the message to Uhura.  The book is well paced and almost impossible to put down. Characterizations are right on the money. I highly recommend this book.	2003-12-21

The book features only two of the main characters after the first 50 pages.  The Enterprise is captured by an alien species the Denari and only Trip and Hoshi escape and are rescued buy some other Denari who are fighting the ones who took the Enterprise.  This is set against a back drop of the flight of an earier than Enterprise starship  Daedalus that exploded on its maiden voyage some 15 years before.  The story has an interesting twist at the end. One thing that was noticably different about this novel was the absence of a B story or plot.	2003-11-28

We see the IKS Gorkon's crew once again as they do the empires bidding while helping to re-establish the true nature of Klingon honor.  This fast paced tale takes place on the planet San-Tarah whos primary inhabitants are a species of warrior like bipedal canines.  These are not at all like the Klingons usual foes and instead of just destroying them and taking the planet Klag accepts the leaders challenge to partake in contest to see who becomes. victor.  Klag accepts and ultimately the Klingon's lose the contests and agree to leave the planet in peace.

To have any real chance to do so Klag calls on the members of the Order of the Batleth to respond to defend Klingon honor.  The story that ensues in is an action packed book that pits Klingon against Klingon while continuing to develop the characters of the Gorkon.

For those of us who missed DS9 when it left the air several years ago Editor Marco Palmieri has performed a minor miricle.  He gathered a stable of excellent authors together and continued DS9 in novel form just as if it were an eighth season and improved on the series. Danelle Perry's Excellent two parter Avatar started the season and Unity completes the season.  For those who missed some of the books or can't remember what transpired in them she provides a synopsis of the \\"season\\" up to Unity.  The book, as Jackie Bundy says in her review, is mesmerizing.  It is something one doesnt want to put down.  It brings characters back into the fold and wraps up some of the threads that have been developing and opens up new possibilities for the \\"ninth\\" season of DS9.  Did Unity live up to my expectations.  No it didn't. IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS.  There was something for everyone in this book and it definately left me wanting more.  Danelle Perry is an awesome writer and I look forward to seeing more DS9 stories by her.  ...this series has been planned out and isnt just a bunch of authors randomly writing stories.  There is a plan to what you see.  This book is a must read.	2003-11-15

This book has a much darker tone than the first three books and is the least favorite for me.  It spends a great deal of time exploring the problems of the various crew members before turning into a very good mystery story. For those readers who like reading about characters who have a mulitude of problems then this is the book for you.  The back cover description gives one the impression that this story is mostly about an archeological find concerning Cardassians and that really isnt the case.  A large portion of the book concerns the Enterprises XO named Halak. Garrett's husband and son are also featured.  Though this book wasnt my cup of tea it was as finely crafted as the first three and I am sure there are those who will like it as much as they did the first three.	2003-10-27

The part in the present day trek universe follows the investigation of the murder of Gleau and all evidence points to Janos as the perp. This part of the story follows the new and in my opinion improved Kebron as he tries to clear his friend of the charges.  The part of the story in the past follows Calhoun and Shelby during their time at Starfleet Academy.   The book is fast paced and hard to put down.  The ending for a change isnt a cliffhanger but it is very bittersweet.  If you are a New Frontier fan you will not be disappointed.	2003-10-27

This latest installment has major changes in store for many of our characters and plenty of action.  The last book left us with McHenry and Morgan Primus appearing to dead.  We have a unique resolution to these to characters that will leave some pleased and some and leave some a bit sad.  S'Cwan finally finds out how Lefler feels about him.  New information is learned about Moke and we see a major change for the better with Zak Kebron and find out the reason for his behavior in the past that will surprise many. If you disliked Zak in the past you will probably find him more to your liking at the end of the book.  I for one cant wait to see where New Frontier will lead.

The book covers 18 years of confict between the Klingon's and the Cardassian's.  DeCandido makes excellent use of characters that have appeared in Star Trek on screen.

Genesis Force is a bit darker than most Star Trek novels. It starts with a hellish scene of Worf leading Klingons in a rescue effort on a planet about to be struck by the genesis wave and the panic that has set in.  We switch scenes to the planet of Aluwna. The remainder of the book tells the story of the effect of the genesis wave on the planet and the rescue and return of some of the citizens of that planet.  Characters introduced in the other 3 books show up again as do some other familar faces. The book is well written and nicely paced The book has a dark tone and deals with hard mission.

The characterizations of those familiar Star Trek characters are right on the money.  The plot is good and richly detailed. The continuity hooks are great. Not only is the book good Star Trek but it is good science fiction.  I strongly urge fans of any of the Star Trek series to read this.

I liked the way Kira was portrayed and I like the new counsellor that was introduced.  I do not like the fact that someone dies at the end though it had been set up.  The Andorian relationships are interesting if somewhat complex. I am interested in seeing where this will lead.  Ezri seemed a bit out of character being to self assured at least compared to the character from the TV show though I must confess that the characters are dynamic and not static as in the show.  There are some things that really dont seem to make sense but one must remember that everything that is done in the DS9 relaunch has a purpose later on.	2002-09-14

He first book written with Armin Shimmerman just blew me away and this book is even better.  Twilight continues the successful relaunch of the DS9 series. The authors attention to detail and descriptive writing style enriches the story.  His characterizations are wonderfully drawn.  This book is a character driven story rather than plot driven and thats fine with me because its the characters who make the story.  We learn a good bit more about Vaughn and why he and his daughter are not on speaking terms and this thread plays out in a most successful manner.  Then there is Ezri and Bashiers continuing relationship.  Ro Laren and Quark develop an amazing relationship.  Kira Has never been a favorite character of mine but the relaunch has changed that.  Kira has to deal with a character who is an admiral who first appeared in one episode of TOS. As mentioned before this is a character driven story that is rich in discription and character development that moves at a fast pace and doesnt disappoint.  I highly recommend this book to any Star Trek fan. It is one of my top favorites off all the Star Trek novels.  I am looking forward to the authors next Star Trek novel.	2002-09-02

Roberta Lincoln has taken over from Gary Seven for the most part in dealing with Khan's attempt to dominate the world and gather together other genetically enhanced humans.

There are some minor flaws with some science facts the ozone hole and with when the internet was available but most people will not be aware of those and they dont distract from the story in the least.

We have a book that is somewhat different from Mike Friedman's usual fare.  We have a book whose story is character driven.  There are no galaxy saving adventures, just people learning to know each other and trying to do the best that they can.  Some succeed whereas others fail just as in real life. The story revolves around Picard being assigned to track down and capture a pirate.  In the course of doing this we are introduced to some engaging new characters. Some remain at the end of the book while others are sent packing.  The book is quick paced and never gets boring and is almost impossible to put down once you begin reading it.

The individual novels were only loosely connected.  Most people probably thought that this last book was going to draw the stories together in a grand finale. That it didnt do. The Challenger segment was at least related to what transpired in the novel as was the TNG story which was the best of the short stories here. The New Frontier story had absolutely nothing to do with the novel or the Gateways and could have easily been left out.  Keith DeCandido's DS9 short story though well written didnt have the least thing to do with his DS9 novel nor the Gateways.  Kira fans would like it.  The Voyager story explains rather poorly the orgin of the Gateways.  The TOS story is just about as weak as the novel but at least it dealt with the story that was set up in the novel.  I did enjoy the Pocket Novel Timeline in the back of the book but then I am a bit prejudiced because I helped to construct it.	2001-11-21

The title indicates that this would be a book that could be used by cadets and other Starfleet personnel to identify starships.  This would suggest that we would have multiple views of each chosen Starship.  Well that isn&#8217;t the case here at all.  What we get is a wire frame shot that is next to useless and a two page beauty shot.  That brings us to the beauty shots.  The vast majority of these beauty shots are entirely too dark showing little detail not to mention the fact that they cross two pages rather than be presented in fold out form.  Voyager, Enterprise-D, Defiant are all from angles that we have seen time and again.  All they offer are too dark renderings.  Parts of the Akira class rendering seem to be out of focus. Another irritating thing was the inclusion of the Work Bee, Spacedock, The MIDAS communications array, and the various shuttle craft.  These are not exactly starships.  The one bright spot of the book is the excellent text provided by Jonathan Lane and Alex Rosenzweig.  I just don&#8217;t think the editors or art department know what fans want in this area.   Why didn&#8217;t we get multiple views  of each ship and some schematics to go with them?  The book measures about 8 X 10 inches and is a bit over a  inch thick.  It is 128 pages in length.  At a cost [I got it for] it just isn&#8217;t worth the price for what one gets.  One can only hope that Mojo brightens up the rendering for next years coffee table book.	2001-11-10

This is Peter David's worst New Frontier book.  I recommend it only if you are an avid New Frontier fan. The plotting is poor, the dialogue stilted.  Shelby's handling of her crew was terribly portrayed.  The resolution of the Lefler plot from the previous book was out of place. Calhouns tale on the planet read like a poorly done western. There is so much about this book that needed improving I am leaving it to other reviewers to say. The book seemed as though it needed a re-write.	2001-09-23

The past few times Pocket Books has addressed that issue in the Star Trek novels it was very poorly done.  However Andy and Michael have depicted this subject in a matter of fact manner that does not detract from the story.  The first review here says the book had a social agenda but I must disagree.  I saw nothing being advocated in the book.   Now that being said let me continue.  This Star Trek novel explores section 31 and does it quite well.  Section 31 is seen in shades of gray.  Nothing is cut and dry.  The bad guys in this book are the Romulans and they are well portrayed. All the characters are drawn with a richness of detail.  Characterizations for the regulars are right on the mark.  We get to see Picard's friends from the episode Tapestry. The story is paced just right to hold ones interest.  This book is 360 pages long which is a good deal longer than average so one gets their moneys worth.  If you are a Next Generation fan you must read this book,it is one of the best of the Next Generation books.	2001-06-07

There is little I can add to Allyn's excellent review of Diplomatic Implausibility.   Character development was what the book was really all about and the story served that purpose well.  It was a pleasure to see Worf being independent and in charge.  Like Allyn I look forward to seeing the Gorkon crew again.  I highly recommend this book to anyone liking Star Trek	2001-02-02
US	52634476	R2XIJ3820GL095	0743411803	662278591	1: The Genesis Wave Book One (Star Trek: The Next Generation)	Books	5	13	17	N	N	Excellent Read	Genesis Wave is one of the best Next Generation Books to come along in a  long time.  It is fast paced and hard to put down.  I must disagree with  the first reviewer.  There is a minimal amount of &quot;science&quot; in  the book and what is there is necessary to the story.  The book starts with  an old Carol Marcus being kidnapped and then jumps forward 6 months into  the future.  Leah Brahms is working with her husband on a planet when  unexpectedly the genesis wave hits killing everyone but Leah and a fellow  scientist who are wearing specially designed environmental suits.  They  escape the destruction. Later they encounter and save the life of Maltz the  Klingon from Star Trek III.  Ultimately they are rescued by the Enterprise  as it embarks on a mission to stop the genesis wave which is headed toward  the heart of the Federation and the Romulan Empire.  Admiral Nechavev  enlist the aid of the Romulans and Klingons to help in evacuations and  protection of planets as the wave devastates everything in its path.  I  recommend this book to all Star Trek fans and am looking forward to the  final book	2000-09-03

This book takes place entirely on Belle Terre.  The stars of this book are Chekov, Sulu, and Uhura.  The shuttle that Chekov is on  crashes and in the story that follows we see Sulu and Uhura deal with a  multitude of problems from technical to dealing with the colonists.  We  also see Chekov struggling to survive.  It is a very good read for fans of  those characters.	2000-07-06

Though well written Kirk seems out of character though the character does follow the other Shatner novels.  We get lots of action in this quick flowing book but we never really see  the Preservers to any satisfying extent.  We see lots of intregue within  Starfleet but none of it is explained by books end.  I found this book to  be average and a rather disappointing read.	2000-06-26
US	52634476	RZPIXPS9UP62	0671035797	648645185	Enterprise Logs: Star Trek	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Enterprise Logs --- Another Winner	With the appearance of Star Trek Enterprise Logs Pocket has another winner in the trend started with Strange New Worlds and The Lives of Dax.<br />Enterprise Logs gives us 10 excellent short stories about captains  of various incarnations of ships named Enterprise<br />One of my favorite  stories involved the Big E from World War II.  This story by Diane Carey is  very thought provoking an possibly her best work to date.  It involves the  captain of the Enterprise and a young Japanese American whos loyalties have  changed.<br />Greg Cox wrote the Robert April story in which we see a familiar  Klingon face and has a nice tie in to an episode of the original episode  &quot;The Conscience of the King&quot;  It is fast paced and very  entertaining.<br />The next story by Jerry Oltion is about Christopher Pike.   We see the characters originally seen in the first Star Trek pilot  &quot;The Cage&quot; as they deal with a new alien culture that wants to  know more about the Federation.  Number One is given a name in the  story.<br />Michael Friedman's Kirk story is different from what one would  expect.  Without giving too much away it is a murder mystery and of course  involves a woman with whom Kirk had a relation ship when he was in his  early 20s.  There is a brief tie in to the April story.<br />Diane Duane  returns to Star Trek with her story of Will Decker. This is different in  that it is set during the time that the Enterprise was being refit prior to  Star Trek The Motion Picture.  For the first time we catch a facinating  glimpse at the man who was to replace Kirk.  The story is set upon the  Enterprise during refit and involves Decker finding spys aboard the ship.   This story left me wanting to know more about Decker before he made  captain.  A facinating character.<br />In Ann Crispin's Spock story set prior  to &quot;The Wrath of Khan&quot; we see the beginnings of the relationship  between Spock and Saavik that culminated in their marriage in Vulcan's  Heart. <br />Peter David's Harriman story continues to develop this captain as  seen in his book &quot;The Captain's Daughter&quot;.  No longer does  Harriman seem the bumbling fool we saw in &quot;Star Trek Generations&quot;  but a man who has redeemed himself.  This story involves Romulans and is  story that pits Harriman against a Romulan interrogator.<br />Robert  Greenberger's story of Rachel Garrett presents a leader much in the mold of  Kirk.  She has to deal with an attack my aliens and we see a very decisive  leader who is not afraid to make decisions.  She is also seen dealing with  the deaths of bridge crew.  We are reintroduced to a younger  Castillo.<br />John Vornholt has Captain Picard revisit the Captain's Table in  a delightful tale about Andorians and succession to the throne.  Its about  time we get to see one of the older alien cultures of Star Trek.<br />I cannot  possible pick a favorite story from the bunch they are all excellent. Diane  Carey's WWII story is the most thought provoking story. This book is a  clear winner and I certainly hope we see a volume two in the future	2000-06-10

The story begins with the crew of the Valiant from the original series Star Trek episode &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot; and fills in  information on what happened to that crew.  Jump 300 years ahead to the  Trek era just preceeding The Next Generation.  Decendants of survivors of  the Valiant appear to warn the Federation of a potential enemy on the other  side of the galatic barrier. The Stargazer and crew are dispatched to see  if the threat is real.  The ship is attacked and the captain is killed and  first officer incapacitated and Picard has to take over. Picard has to deal  with a mutiny, a damaged ship, gain trust of the crew he now commands, deal  with a Kelvin, and the new threat to the Federation.  If you like space  battles and action there is plenty in this book.  We see characters that  first appeared in Friedmans Star Trek book Reunion and their character  development in this book helps explain their actions in the previous book.    For fans of Star Trek this book is a must.	2000-04-01

Lives of Dax had me hooked from the moment that I saw it's cover.  The book is an excellent anthology telling stories from each of the different hosts of the symbiont Dax from Star Trek Deep Space.  Using the few  continuity clues provided from the show the numerous authors weave powerful  tales for each of the Dax symbionts. We see many familiar faces in the  stories from Vic Fontaine to T'Pau,  Dr. McCoy, Christopher Pike and  others. These familiar characters help to blend the stories seamlessly into  the Trek mythos. The stories were all first rate. I could not pick a  favorite story from the bunch. Each of them could easily have made an  excellent DS9 episode.  Fans of DS9 and Star Trek will find this a must  read.  Kudos to the authors and editor.	1999-11-29

The book is a celebration of the Federation after the Dominion War.  It takes us in painting and in  Friedmans excellent text to 18 stops from Starbase 11 to the Q-Continuum.  There are short biographical sketches of each of the artists at the end of  the book. I recommend this book to all fans of Star Trek.  It left me  wanting more.	1999-11-06
