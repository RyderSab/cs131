As you've read, she was the daughter of one of King Muhammed V's most trusted generals.  As such she was raised as a royal princess under his successor, King Hassan II.  This immediately reminded me of the story of Moses and Pharoah from Exodus.  She is the primary playmate of the King's daughter and lives a life of luxury.<br /><br />However, justice and punishment are dealt with very differently in this part of the world, and after Malika's father leads an unsuccessful coup/assassination attempt on King Hassan II, she and her family are imprisoned.  It is difficult again to empathize - although they knew nothing of the coup, would each of us trust them if we were the target?  They complain of being deprived of luxuries which most of us can only dream about.<br /><br />As they eventually are moved to barracks which are terribly conditioned, totally dark, and are basically marooned there, it becomes obvious to them they are to die there.  Despite an escape and recapture, five years later they are freed.  Malika achieves ultimate redemption when she is freed, and now lives in France, which had a colony in Morocco for some time.<br /><br />The parallel with Exodus is not perfect, to be sure.  However, the 'princess' once expelled, finds herself in her journey through a considerably harsher wilderness and eventually does succeed, along with her family, in reaching their goal of freedom.<br /><br />This book will make you think.  Most interestingly, you will realize after noticing that you didn't empathize as much with them as others in their situation, that you may think differently about yourself!  After all, does anyone deserve that type of treatment?<br /><br />As you read this book and through periodic reality checks remember that it is true, you will realize that man's inhumanity to man has no end.  You will also realize, as I believe Oprah did, that the spirit can overcome virtually anything.<br /><br />This book is not that expensive and I would recommend anyone with even a passing interest read it.  It will be worth your while.ook is not that expensive and I would recommend anyone with even a passing interest read it.  It will be worth your while.	2001-05-18

Like most fantasy or children's books, there is a common misperception that they are specfically entertaining for children.  I couldn't disagree more, and these books are excellent examples to the contrary.<br /><br />I have several friends who are both into fantasy and not into fantasy.  Two have kids ages 5 and 3.  When they read Harry Potter to their children, they not only get to bond with their children who are fascinated by the book - they enjoy it themselves!  Like good Looney Tunes bits in the past, some jokes are funnier if you're an adult.<br /><br />In these particular two books, Miss Rowling has shown that she really has a finger on the pulse of what makes kids tick.  After the first four books, and with a fifth due very soon, she realized that most kids were using their imaginations (which in these days is rare) and wondering about 'What if I were in school with Harry?' and 'How would I know what to do and where to go?' amongst other questions.<br /><br />These two books fit that bill well and I think those parents who got questions from their children like 'What's a muggle?' will also enjoy these books more than they might guess.<br /><br />Buy these books - at this price their return to you and yours makes this a pearl of a deal!	2001-04-03

The most troublesome cases are those in children, who cannot understand what is happening to them.  I know children with OCD and they talk to me in a very frightened tone.<br /><br />Icy reminds me of these children.  She hides when the impusles become to difficult to resist.  The writing here is especially good in describing Icy's struggle.  The earlier quote that she is \\"a little girl who had to keep all of her compulsions inside,\\" is right on the money.<br /><br />I had some trouble believing that her institutionalization at  the Bluegrass State Hospital would 'persuade' her that there are actually children more \\"different\\" than she. Most children haven't the capacity to accept that.  It is one of the great unknown epidemics in today's society.<br /><br />It is also somewhat difficult to believe the epilogue as children don't necessarily 'prevail' over these disorders - they are with them for the rest of their lives in nearly all cases - but they can learn to control the disorders - and that's the critical thing for those in therapy to understand.<br /><br />I was moved by the quote:  \\"Children silent as stone sing for me. Children who cannot speak create music for me.\\"  This is the hallmark of a good child psychiatrist/psychologist.  While I think this book is a valuable addition to anyone wishing to learn more about the stigma of mental illness this is a must buy.  However, as a 'recovery' story it still seems misunderstood by readers.  The 'overdone' prose it how people with these disorders speak of their 'affliction'.  I applaud Rubio for recognizing this.<br /><br />I also about Rubio's pointing out that most people with mental illness are actually suffering from a biochemical imbalance which is treatable - not from 'brain fevers'.  Too many people today still think the latter - in this book note how Icy is isolated from her friends and community.<br /><br />I want to disagree with those people who want to 'label' this book as 'Appalachian' or as a metaphor for society or as a book for women only.<br /><br />I think this book is a must read for anyone interested in learning about the stigma of mental illness.  The above metaphors do apply but I think they miss the key point of the book.<br /><br />This is a valuable contribution to the genre of 'memoirs', real or fictional, of people with mental illness.  There are even some books about these disorders written as children's books!  I can only hope Rubio will continue to write in her pleasant straightforward style on similar subjects.<br /><br />Buy this book - you won't be disappointed.he latter - in this book note how Icy is isolated from her friends and community.

It hithome for me and will most likely hit home for many others because we know of families that seem perfect.... and often we find out much later what was truly happening.<br /><br />I do not believe that the choice of Mt. Ephraim as the hometown of the Mulvaneys was by accident. Ephraim and Manasseh were sons of Joseph - and while the latter committed heinous crimes against all moral authority, Ephraim was a redeemer. A striking metaphor against which much hurt is set - and one missed by the editorial reviewers.<br /><br />This family functions quite well - all that we'd say is 'too good to be true' *is* actually true until Marianne, the girl so beautifully described that we actually *feel* she's the 'girl next door' to *us* is sexually assaulted. Actually, we are never told whether it was rape or consensual. And the beauty of this is that for the purposes of this story it doesn't matter.<br /><br />It is the *effect* of the assault on the family that begins their descent. I will not spoil the book by telling you the details as to how each of the brothers and the parents fall off their respective wagons. But the cumulative effect is devasting, as told by the narrator, a now adult youngest brother Judd.<br /><br />How can such a complete destruction of a classic nuclear family be a book I'd want to read? Because as someone once said, it is when a man stares into the abyss that he finds his character.<br /><br />Suffice it to say that when you are done with this book you will feel as though you knew the Mulvaneys, suffered with them, and wonder how you would have reacted.<br /><br />I believe everyone can relate to one or more of the characters in this book.<br /><br />I also believe that this book is a *must* read.<br /><br />If you want a book that will make you think realistically about life's challenges - and not give you answers, but rather present situations that make you think about how you would respond, this is the book for you.<br /><br />The cliche that we learn more from our mistakes than our successes never applied more.<br /><br />And all of us can probably stand to look at this side of life. As with 'The Dark Side of the Light Chasers', it is by looking at our human frailties and faults, shining the light on ourselves, warts and all, that we can come to true self-awareness.sent situations that make you think about how you would respond, this is the book for you.

In my review of Cheryl Richardson's 'Life Makeovers' I pointed out that an author's approach and style are what distinguish his or her work from the amazing number of self-help books available.<br /><br />I would call this book 'a blunter 'Life Makeovers''.<br /><br />For those who are unfamiliar with Dr. Phil's approach (he has appeared on talk shows, especially 'Oprah!') you will at first probably be turned off as I was.  A 'client' will go on stage with him and start explaining the problem he or she has.  He frequently interrupts and bluntly gets right to the most important underlying question.<br /><br />The interesting thing is that this is the approach used by the best psychologists/psychiatrists.  When you distill the problems you have down to the basic issue it becomes much easier to face and solve.<br /><br />This book, by putting you in Dr. Phil's 'office', exposes you to this type of 'therapy'.<br /><br />Is it a substitute for professional help if needed?  No.<br /><br />Is it an excellent way of trying to control your own destiny and see if you can solve your problems yourself?  YES.<br /><br />You might not be able to solve them - but this book will be your best chance to discover if you can.<br /><br />I give this book a recommendation without reservation.<br /><br />At least give it a try - it may change your outlook - it may change your life.	2001-01-31

Cheryl Richardson's writing style and thought processes are what distinguish this book from other self-help books in this area.  People in search of this type of book are frequently mystified either online or in the bookstore wondering which one is right for them.  For a good majority of these people, including myself, I can enthusiastically recommend all of Cheryl's books.<br /><br />Cheryl's suggestions are pragmatic and realistic, yet she has the  unique ability amongst writers in this area to suggest pragmatic and realistic solutions in a gentle, compassionate, and most importantly, non-condescending way.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a self-help book to literally give themselves a 'life makeover' (an *extremely* apropos title for this book!) should at the very least give this book a try.<br /><br />Is this the book for everyone?  No.  Everyone takes to different styles.  Everyone's path to a 'life makeover' is different.  However, I think this book will at the very least provide a jump start for people needing one.  At its best, it will, via it's day-by-day structure, keep you on the path to a revitalized outlook on your life.<br /><br />I give this book a wholehearted recommendation and have recommended it to friends, which I do not often do.<br /><br />I hope the readers have the same results as I did.	2001-01-23

Robert Reich was now ex-President Clinton's Secretary of Labor during his first term.  I think many people questioned why he wasn't back for the second term.  Those questions are answered here.<br /><br />*Most* importantly, the reasons apply to virtually all of the families in America today.  Prior to the 1980's, the nuclear family and the way children were raised was arguably better for the children.  With the advent of the new information technologies, and with the need to work harder not smarter (despite what corporations say - this is the real paradigm), people are putting in more hours and getting less quality time with their families.  The fact that 'Dilbert' would never have sold in the 1970's as well as it does now is actually quite telling.<br /><br />The conversation with his child (which I won't spoil for you) that led Reich to his decision is touching and more worrysome, telling.  That is, in today's society it's easy to lose the forest for the trees.<br /><br />No one on their deathbed says, \\"I wished I'd spent more time on my career\\"....<br /><br />At least give this book a chance, regardless of your political inclinations.<br /><br />I would argue this is a must read for people in business today, and especially those with young families.	2001-01-20

I would not say that about this selection.    If you are intrigued by stories of people struggling through adversity in the context of a 'true' current situation (such as the immigrant situation in the United States) then this book will probably enthrall you.  It is powerfully written, and the characters strength in the face of unrelenting hard knocks will likely inspire you regardless of what you think of the book's ending.    If you are looking for the more typical book club selection in which a person or people may struggle against adversity yet by remembering their spirit and learning to be true to themselves they overcome it, then this book may disappoint you.    For those who fall in the latter category, I still think the book is worth a read because as the saying goes we learn more from our mistakes than from our successes - and this book relates in some way to all of us and the feeling of helplessness we've all felt in our lives at one time or another.    Buy this book.  It's worth the price either way and like any well-written novel it makes you *think*, whether you liked it or not.  And that's what I think most book club readers want to do.

And even if you're not 'into' wine, it's still a great buy if you like an engaging story.<br /><br />The French never call themselves 'connoiseurs' of wine as the word means they 'know' wine.

That is, the truth has slowly been deemed more important than adding some small tidbits to the 'usual' story.<br /><br />From primary sources, I can tell you that this book is the closest to a 'true' picture of these men, whose names we all know, of all the books I've read on the subject.  I have read a lot.  It is not an expose'.

But for the reader who wants a complete collection in a beautifully bound copy, of Shakespeare's works this is an incredible bargain.  You will learn much.<br /><br />I feel that you will actually learn more by reading it *without* commentary first.  In that way you will gain your own opinion of the works.

This is because one eventually comes to an understanding as to how we could possibly have defeated the most mighty nation on Earth at the time.<br /><br />Enjoy!	2000-12-25

The movie was epic in scope, and although some historical inaccuracies existed, they did not detract at all from the movie, nor the performances of Russell Crowe, Connie Nielsen, Joachim Phoenix, and Richard Harris.<br /><br />If you like to know the 'nuts and bolts' behind the making of a movie such as this, this is your book.  If you are curious how they managed to 'reconstruct' the Coliseum complete with gladiator 'fans', this is your book.<br /><br />A great gift for Gladiator and Russell Crowe fans alike.<br /><br />Commodus was in fact Marcus Aurelius' son and the downfall of Rome, while already in progress, hastened when Commodus was made Caesar.<br /><br />Enjoy!  And watch the movie again.	2000-12-25

This book is by far the best reference I have seen on the evolution of anti-tank weapons.  I use the term evolution intentionally.  As in evolutionary theory, species must adapt or die.  Well, first there was the tank, then there were rudimentary ways to defeat it, the tank manufacturers  adjusted, and so did the infantry, and so on.  This book details it  beautifully.  The British always seem to have the best books on these  subjects.	2000-05-03

By the title of this review, I do not by any means imply that Hitler altered the future in a positive way.  However, consider that in each case in this book, had he chosen a different path, the whole war not only may have been different, but may have ended differently.  I have always  advocated that one of the best ways to learn history is to first read the  textbook then read an alternate history.  This book fits that bill.  If  World War II is your particular field of study, or even wargaming World War  II, you will find this book fascinating.	2000-05-03

And  further, Stonewall Jackson and the Conferates were aristocratic.  NOT  democratic in the literal sense.  Witness for example Appomattox and how  Grant and Lee were dressed, respectively.<br /><br />Second, Sherman can effectively  be considered the 'father of blitzkrieg' as he bypassed strongholds in an  effort to circle the enemy's flanks and make rapid progress and achieve  rapid resolution.  This is especially true in his Carolinas Campaign of  64-65.<br /><br />Patton's army was easily more 'democratic' than Bradley's.  Read  Ladislas Farago's Patton, on which the movie was based.  Highly accurate,  it points out how Ike (who was admittedly under great pressure from two  governments with very different ideas on how to wage war) and Bradley (who,  while a soldier's soldier, never really distinguished himself, see below)  typically put the reigns on Patton - e.g., to let Monty's failed attempt at  Arnhem proceed, etc.  In fact, one could argue that Bradley's positioning  of the 106th ID at the Schnee Eiffel just prior to the Ardennes Offensive  of Dec-Jan 1944 condemned these green recruits to the annihilation they  suffered.  Did Bradley totally forget where the Wehrmacht attacked in May  1940?  How the situation was very similar (British in Belgium and the  Netherlands), mostly Allies in the south?  In my opinion, while to be  respected for his ideals, Bradley was far inferior to Patton as a  tactician.  So what if Patton couldn't keep his mouth shut?  He certainly  was proven right about Soviet Russia.  Ike learned this the hard way from  52-60 as President.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book does show three generals who  could be considered 'mavericks'.  Democratic is perhaps the wrong word for  their respective armies, but certainly, as baseball teams reflect the  personalities of their managers, so too do armies reflect the character of  their commanders.their respective armies, but certainly, as baseball teams reflect the  personalities of their managers, so too do armies reflect the character of  their commanders.	2000-05-03

I consider myself fairly intelligent, yet had never heard of a chiasmus.  When I learned of them through this book, you can't imagine the fun I had trying to create them commuting to and from work.  I imagine I will someday be able to start presentations with quotes that I made up that fell into  this category - which isn't conceit, but rather thanks to the author for  writing this book.	2000-04-30

The best familiar case to Americans would be  Diamond Creek Vineyards.  In just one small valley with four distinct  microclimates, four completely different Cabernet Sauvignons result.  Although the French believe this more than most Americans, that view is  beginning to change - i.e., a Russian River Valley Pinot Noir is noticeably  different than an Oregon Pinot Noir.<br /><br />This book will convince you.  Terroir is real, not simply something an aesthete would appreciate.	2000-04-26

As a wine 'amateur' (French meaning - no French person would ever say they were a 'connossieur' of wine, as one can never know it), this book was great in teaching more of the nuts and bolts of the wine biz.  Grab this online somewhere - hopefully Amazon.com's out-of-print service - but grab  it - it is very interesting.	2000-04-25

As a military history expert, I always prefer to read memoirs by the 'actors' themselves.  Read this one.  Rent Patton.  Read Ladislas Farago's book (on which the movie was based).  Then read this book.  When  you're done, tell me (whether you like the man or not) that you aren't at  least impressed with the man's skill as well as knowledge of the enemy  (specifically, the Soviet Union near the end of the war).<br /><br />You will not be  disappointed.	2000-04-25

This book is terrible in comparison	If you read the Axelrod book on Patton it relates to management much better than this attempt.

Province idolizes Patton and tends to downplay his ability to moblize his army, effectively using Blitzkrieg tactics against the Germans themselves.  Patton would likely agree that  this was his destiny although he clearly did not enjoy losing his men,  albeit honorably.  However, Province has chosen to take advantage of the  cult of personality around Patton as his web site allows you to join the  Patton Society for sums of money which get you a 'rank'.  I do not think  General Georgie would approve.	1999-12-19

It contains typos such as 'D Day' and also does not give any insight into the man.  Connecting Patton to  Deming seems a bit ridiculous to someone with knowledge of the two  men.<br /><br />Patton did not consider war 'great', per se', and should not be  idolized.  He enjoyed it and was excellent at it, however he agonized over  the men he lost.  Perhaps that is the analogy that businessmen should make  today.	1999-12-19
