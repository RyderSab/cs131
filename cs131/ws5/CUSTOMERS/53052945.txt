If James Lee Burke hit a home run with Purple Cane Road, Jolie Blon's Bounce (the 12th in the Dave Robicheaux series) is a grand slam.<br /><br />A New Iberia teenager is brutally raped and murdered, and Tee Bobby Hulin is the key suspect.  Tee Bobby has his problems (including drugs), but Robicheaux is not convinced that Hulin is capable of such brutality.  Another girl is found murdered in the same manner, and her mobster father isn't happy with the slow pace of the police investigation.  He and a bunch of his cronies descend on New Iberia to take matters into their own hands.  A bunch of other mysterious characters also appear in New Iberia including a geeky Bible salesman and a homeless Viet Nam vet who claims to have rescued Robicheaux.  At times, it's hard to tell whether these men are harmless.  Looming over the entire book is the presence of Legion Guidry, a former overseer of a plantation and a man so evil that he almost seems inhuman.  Detective Robicheaux seems convinced that the key to solving these cases lies in something that happened to Tee Bobby's grandmother in her youth, and somehow, Legion has a part in this.<br /><br />Where Burke excels in Jolie Blon's Bounce is his observations and descriptions-especially of Louisiana.  Robicheaux's friend Clete tells him \\"This is Louisiana, Dave.  Guatemala North.  Quit pretending it's the United States.  Life will make more sense.\\"  Also, \\"A love affair with Louisiana is in some ways like falling in love with the biblical [witch] of Babylon.\\"  Burke also knows the depth and despair of the spirit when Robicheaux muses that the real enemy is \\"a violent creature who rose with me in the morning and lived quietly inside my skin, waiting for the proper moment to vent his rage upon the world.\\"  Another of my favorites is \\"the worse deeds human beings commit are precipitated by a happenstance meeting of individuals and events, who and which, if they were rearranged only lightly, would never leave a bump in our history.\\"  All of Burke's books are filled with these gems, but Jolie Blon has more than most.  There is no doubt that Burke belongs on a very short and elite list of the best mystery writers today.<br /><br />I have one more book to read in this series, his new Crusader's Cross.  There aren't too many authors who could have kept me enthralled for 14 straight books.  It might be the end of the series, but Burke still has another series as well (Billy Bob Holland).

After a less than stellar effort with Sunset Limited, James Lee Burke comes back strong with Purple Cane Road.  In fact, Purple Cane (book number 11) might just be his best Robicheaux  mystery yet.<br /><br />Letty Labiche, a twin from New Iberia, is on death row for murdering a man who was an executioner in Louisiana.  The rumor is that this man abused the twins as children, but they're not talking.  There isn't much sympathy for Letty, but Robicheaux wants to see her spared the death penalty and to see that justice is served.  At the same time, Robicheaux hears from an informant that he has information about the death of Robicheaux's mother.  Mae Guillory Robicheaux left Robicheaux and his alcoholic father years ago, and her past is very murky.  The informant tells the detective his mother was a prostitute and was murdered by three cops in a scam gone bad.  This is unsettling news to Robicheaux, who now leaves no stone unturned in a effort to discover the truth.  This process causes Robicheaux to deal with unresolved issues about his mothers abandonment and come to turns with her past.  But there are those who wish to keep the truth from Robicheaux, including the Louisiana district attorney and some well-placed cops.<br /><br />One of Burke's best characters is Johnny Remata.  Robicheaux ends up saving the life of this hit man, and Remata feels he owes Robicheaux.  Remata is a complex and very intelligent man who sometimes shows a sympathetic streak.  He starts killing off Robicheaux's enemies, but also starts marking overtures to Robicheaux's daughter, Alafair.  For the first time, we get to see Alafair as a moody and defiant teenager.<br /><br />In Purple Cane Road, Robicheaux has to deal with so many issues.  Was his mother really a prostitute and a scam artist and who murdered her?  How can he protect Alafair without driving her away?  And what demons are haunting Clete Purcel to the point of self-destruction?<br /><br />Purple Cane is packed with turmoil, angst, action, a great plot and incredible writing.  Unlike many Burke books, Purple Cane has a bit of a surprise ending.  It's very rare when an author writes so many books in a series and they just keep getting better.turmoil, angst, action, a great plot and incredible writing.

When a writer becomes prolific with a mystery series, some books are bound to be better than others.  Sunset Limited, the 10th in James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux series, is not nearly as strong as some of his previous efforts.<br /><br />Robicheaux continues to be a detective in the Iberia Sheriff's Department, and this book has many similarities to previous books.  James Flynn, a labor organizer, was crucified to the side of a barn forty years ago.  Flynn's grown children, Megan (an award winning photographer) and Cisco (a movie director) are back in town.  Their presence calls attention to the fact that their father's death remains unsolved.  Robicheaux is always investigating at least two or three other crimes.  In Sunset Limited, Robicheaux and his partner, Helen Soileau, stumble upon a conspiracy involving crooked cops, small time criminals, hit men, the son of a senator and the mob.  Somehow, Robicheaux is able to tie together these seemingly unrelated cases, but doing so is often a stretch.  Characters fade in and out and it's hard to keep track of them.  It took a good 100 pages for Sunset Limited to peak my interest.<br /><br />James Lee Burke is an incredibly talented writer, and some of the problem could be my own.  This is the 11th Robicheaux mystery and the 12th Burke novel that I've read since August, so maybe I'm just ready for a break.  Still, I'm determined to see the Robicheaux series through book 14.  I've since started reading Purple Cane Road, and after 100 pages, it's already much more engaging.	2005-10-05

I like James Lee Burke best when he confines his books to local themes, and he does just that in Cadillac Jukebox, the 9th in his Dave Robicheaux mystery series.<br /><br />Robicheaux is still working for the New Iberia Sheriff's Department.  Buford LaRose comes from a prominent New Iberia family and was a former college football hero.  This golden boy is now running for governor.  Over three decades prior, Aaron Crown (a former Klansman) was accused of murdering a civil rights leader, although it took 28 years to bring him to trial.  LaRose wrote a book that helped bring about a conviction.  Now, a filmmaker is filming a documentary in New Iberia to prove Crown's innocence.  Robicheaux is asked to check out Crown's claims, and Robicheaux begins to think Crown was made a scapegoat.  As Robicheaux investigates this case, he gets warned away by a number of strange and unattached individuals.  As in most Southern Louisiana schemes, the mob is always close at hand.  Also, there is a terribly frigtening hit man, Mookie Zerrang, who tortures just for fun.  He's after Robicheaux, although he doesn't know who hired him.<br /><br />The more Robicheaux digs, the more dead bodies turn up (mostly those involved with proving Crown's innocence).  Unfortunately, with people like Buford LaRose, evil deeds are done in their names but they never dirty their own hands.  Robicheaux is determined to not only find some dirt under LaRose's fingernails, but also, some skeletons in his closet.  The plot is made even more interesting by the fact that LaRose's wife, Karyn, had a romance with Robicheaux back in his drinking days.  Robicheaux unceremoniously dumped this homecoming queen and Karyn now has a hidden agenda that includes humiliation and revenge.<br /><br />Robicheaux's new partner, Helen Hoileau, continues to be a good match, and friend Cletus Purcel is always a scream.  A former cop, Purcel tells Robicheaux he is better able to work outside the law to help solve cases.  That's definitely an understatement.<br /><br />I have four more books in this series to read, and I'm going to be sorry to see it come to an end.hat's definitely an understatement.  <br /> <br />I have four more books in this series to read, and I'm going to be sorry to see it come to an end.	2005-09-28

I love almost everything about James Lee Burke including his prose, his characters and especially, the locations he writes about.  But Burning Angel is the second book in a row where I had a problem with the plot.<br /><br />As usual, Dave Robicheaux (deputy with the New Iberia Sheriff's Department) has way too much going on.  First, Robicheaux runs into a \\"friend\\" who grew up in New Iberia and ended up being a Canal Street fixer in New Orleans.  Sonny Boy Marsallus has dabbled in almost everything including being a Latin American mercenary and an independent working for the DEA.  Marsallus thinks his life is in danger and asks Robicheaux to hold a notebook with damaging information.  A plantation owner is trying to gain possession of land that his grandfather deeded to the families of former slaves.  Why he wants the land is a big mystery, but the mob also seems to be involved.  It is also rumored that Jean Lafitte buried treasure there.  Lots of bad guys hover on the edges and there always seems to be a hit out on Robicheaux.<br /><br />There were too many things going on in Burning Angel, and I had a hard time keeping them all straight.  I'm ok with the the local crimes, the mob plots, and even the Viet Nam angle.  But Burke gets very murky when delving into the world of clandestine operations in Latin America.  Usually Burke wraps things up at the end, but there were an awful lot of loose ends hanging here.  Even the epilogue wasn't much help.<br /><br />Despite the plot, there is still enough in Burning Angel to keep me reading.  Burke regales us not just with the beauty of Louisiana, but also her ugliness (her racism, exploitation of the environment, the mob influence, poverty, the crime, etc.).  Robicheaux's new partner, Helen Soileau, is also a good fit.  She's unlike any woman he has teamed up with in the past.  She's not always very politically correct and sometimes shows less restraint than Robicheaux.  Clete Purcell and Helen loathe each other, but a grudging respect develops when they pull together to assist Robicheaux.  It's rather comical.<br /><br />Even though the plot of Burning Angel was not as polished as previous books, Burke is still a better writer than most mystery writers today.  I'm still determined to read them all and I have five more to go., but a grudging respect develops when they pull together to assist Robicheaux.

In The Electric Mist with Confederate Dead is the 6th Dave Robicheaux mystery by James Lee Burke.  While most of this book is first rate, I think Burke got bogged down with the plot.  There was a little too much going on, including a sub-plot in a different dimension.<br /><br />In Confederate Dead, New Iberia is a happening place.  Julie Balboni, a local boy turned mob boss, returns to town.  A major Hollywood production company is filming a Civil War epic, and Balboni is part owner.  The Teamsters are also involved with the filming, which makes for very strange bedfellows.  While the Chamber of Commerce is happy to have so much money being pumped into New Iberia, the sheriff's department is nervous with Balboni's presence.  Soon, the bodies of two prostitutes turn up, brutally murdered.  And the skeleton of a man still in chains and killed in 1957 is found by the star of the movie, Elrod Sykes.  All of these cases are quite a bit for Robicheaux (a New Iberia sheriff's deputy) to juggle at one time, and he is convinced that they're all somehow related.  He also ends up \\"babysitting\\" Elrod Sykes, as Elrod struggles with alcoholism (a malady that Robicheaux knows all too well).<br /><br />One aspect that worked very well in Confederate Dead was the addition of a \\"partner\\" for Robicheaux, FBI agent Rosie Gomez.  The sheriff calls in the FBI to assist with the murdered prostitutes.  Gomez quickly earns the respect of Robicheaux.  When Robicheaux is framed and his own department hang him out to dry, Gomez picks up the slack.  She also learns some important lessons from Robicheaux-especially that it's sometimes necessary to operate outside the normal boundaries of law enforcement to be successful.<br /><br />But I have to admit that I didn't quite grasp the sub-plot with the Confederate dead.  Robicheaux starts seeing visions of Confederate soldiers who were camped in New Iberia, and he has numerous conversations with Confederate general, John Bell Hood, about the cases he's working on and about the war.  While some of it worked well, I thought it got hokey at the end and a bit over the top.<br /><br />Despite this criticism, Burke is one of the best mystery writers today and Confederate Dead is an enjoyable work.he cases he's working on and about the war.

James Lee Burke has given us another strong effort in his fifth Dave Robicheaux mystery, A Stained White Radiance.<br /><br />Book five opens with someone shooting a rifle through a window of Weldon Sonnier's house.  The Sonnier children (Weldon, Lyle and Drew) were friends of Robicheaux's growing up in New Iberia.  Unfortunately, they suffered a horrendous childhood at the hands of their father.  It is obvious that Weldon is hiding something and that his life is in danger.  A few days later, three men break into Weldon's house and trash the place.  When Robicheaux arrives as backup at the scene, he discovers the body of a fellow police officer who was first sent to investigate.  He was executed mob-style.  Robicheaux now applies a full court press to identify the murderers, discover who is behind then, and also, reveal what dark secrets the Sonnier's are hiding.  Burke also has to deal with some issues at home including a sick wife (lupus) who is jealous of an old flame.  We also see Robicheaux more in an AA setting.  Although he remains on the wagon, we see him work the program more than in previous books.<br /><br />A Stained White Radiance touches on the \\"usual\\" southern Louisiana maladies including drug dealing.  But Burke also shows the ugly side of Louisiana that often includes not on the mob, but also rednecks, Nazi's and Aryans.  One character, Bobby Earl, is a former Klansman now running for state office (think David Duke).  He operates on the fringe, getting others to do his dirty work.  Somehow, these guys are all in bed together.<br /><br />Burke has always been a fine writer, but he really tightened things up since the first books in this series.  The plots are less predictable and more enjoyable.  The good guys don't always win and the bad guys don't always lose (which often happens in the real world). Burke's character development has also evolved, and they become more complex and are written in more varied hues.  These changes have provided his readers with a richer texture.<br /><br />In each book, Robicheaux always seems to get into a life-threatening scrape.

Vowell claims not to be a real historian, but instead, tries to entertain.  Critics have called her a social observer.  She is definitely a historical and political observer as well.  However we categorize her, Vowell sews together dozens of stories about the assassinations of presidents Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley to produce an impressive quilt.<br /><br />While most people vacation in happier settings (the beach, Disney World, etc.), Vowell sets out on a pilgrimage to bring the stories of these three assassinations to life.  She travels to Alaska to see totem poles and the Dry Tortugas to see the cell of Dr. Samuel Mudd.  She visits presidential homes, offices, assassination sites and places of death.  She tours museums seeking out bone fragments, bloodied garments, murder weapons and autopsy tools. She traces the escape route of John Wilkes Booth, stopping at the locations where he stopped.  And she visits graves, tombs and monuments.  As she travels, she regales us with numerous stories and observations that tie these events together.<br /><br />Vowell states that \\"history is full of really good stories,\\" and many that she tells are not common knowledge.  Many of the stories are funny, as when she compares the black vomit of yellow fever to her more festive vomiting of key lime yogurt on a boat ride to Fort Jefferson. Some are filled with irony.  When she sees both Confederate and American flag displays at a restaurant in Maryland, she observes that they're geared for those who are open-mined enough \\"of hating blacks and Arabs at the same time.\\"  Some of her stories are touching. When Garfield's doctors determined that moving the ailing president to his summer home in Long Branch, NJ would be better for his recovery, the residents of Long Branch laid a special railroad spur of 3200 feet to his house.  When his train stalled near the end, they pushed his car by hand to its final destination.  Many of her stories provide amazing coincidences.  Robert Todd Lincoln was present or nearby all three assassinations.  Also, as a young boy, Robert Todd Lincoln was rescued off a train track by Edwin Booth (John Wilkes Booth's brother).  Also, at the same time as Edwin Booth's funeral, three floors of Ford's Theatre collapsed, killing 22 federal employees.  Some of the stories are very disturbing.  For instance, the site of John Wilkes Booth's death has become a Confederate shrine.  Or that the Maryland State song, Maryland, My Maryland, contains pro-Confederate lyrics (\\"She spurns the Northern scum\\").  Most disturbing is that when Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people in Oklahoma, he was wearing a T-shirt with Abraham Lincoln on the front with the worlds \\"Sic Semper Tyrannis\\" underneath.  After the bombing, Southern Partisan (the pro-Confederate catalog and magazine where McVeigh purchased the shirt) had a hard time keeping them in stock.<br /><br />Vowell is also a shrewd observer.  She describes Maryland as \\"it was the border state, a schizophrenic no-man's-land with the North at its door and the South in its heart.\\"  Or, \\"whereas the living in Baltimore could use a renovation, the dead rest in resplendent peace.\\"  She is amazing at bringing the presidents and their assassins to life.<br /><br />It is refreshing to read a book where the author has such a fascination and enthusiasm for history.  The only author today that I can compare her to is Tony Horwitz (Confederates in the Attic).  In one story, Vowell tells us that the nickname for Stephen Douglas was The Little Giant.

In A Morning for Flamingos (the fourth Dave Robicheaux mystery), James Lee Burke really hits his stride.  This is the best book yet of the six that I've read.<br /><br />Since Black Cherry Blues, Robicheaux is once again working for the Iberia Sheriff's Department.  After fighting a murder charge in book three, he needs to pay off his debts.  On a routine transfer of two death row inmates, one of the inmates, Jimmie Lee Boggs, plans an escape.  Robicheaux is shot and another detective is killed.  At the end of a three month recovery, a DEA agent from a former book, Minor Dautrieve, calls Robicheaux with a proposal.  Dautrieve wants Robicheaux to go undercover in New Orleans for the DEA.  They will tell everyone he's been fired from law enforcement and are hoping that Robicheaux will lead them to a major mobster in town, Tony Cardo.  Robicheaux is reluctant at first, but takes the job in an effort to find Jimmie Lee Boggs (who has been seen in New Orleans).<br /><br />As the book progresses, Robicheaux gets to know Cardo and the closer he gets, the more conflicted he becomes.  Cardo may be a Mafioso, but he's also a loving father to a handicapped son, a tortured Viet Nam vet and a loyal friend.  His feelings for Cardo become a major complication with the potential to jeopardize the entire undercover operation.  One other complication is the introduction of Bootsie-an old girlfriend whose former husband had mob ties.<br /><br />In A Morning for Flamingos, Burke is running on all cylinders.  His writing is always first rate, but the plot is more inventive and gets away from the formula we've come to expect.  While Dautrieve tells Robicheaux \\"we can't have Wyatt Earp on the payroll,\\" Robicheaux actually shows a little restraint for once.  It is Cletus Purcel who starts behaving like a rogue cowboy.  Robicheaux operates within the law, while Purcel functions on the fringe. The dynamics of this relationship will continue to develop in future books.  But where Burke really excels is his character development.  Tony Cardo may coordinate mob activities and drug dealing in southern Louisiana, but Burke portrays him as a tortured and conflicted man.  For probably the first time in his 50 years, Robicheaux starts seeing things in other than black and white.  And the shades of gray start clouding his vision and his judgment.  Burke also shows us how it is possible to love a city and hate it at the same time.  Robicheaux as a cop has certainly seen the grimmer side of The Big Easy including the welfare projects that produced prostitution, \\"rats, cockroaches, incest, rape, child molestation, narcotics and sadistic street gangs,\\" as well as murder.  Ironically, Hurricane Katrina has given that steamier side of New Orleans a national audience.<br /><br />After Heavenly Prisoners, I decided to read two more Robicheaux and then take a break.

Black Cherry Blues is the third book in James Lee Burke's Dave Robicheaux series, and thankfully, it is a lot less dark and depressing than Heaven's Prisoners, book number two.<br /><br />Robicheaux has resigned from the Iberia Sheriff's Department to concentrate on his boat-and-bait business.  Early on, he runs into an old college roommate who needs some help.  Dixie Lee Pugh works for an oil drilling company, where he overhears two of the company's hatchet-men brag about murdering two men.  When they learn that Pugh overheard them, his life is in danger.  So when Robicheaux starts snooping around, he is also threatened.  Robicheaux goes after the two with a chain, and the next day, one of them is dead and the other (Harry Mapes) has disappeared.  Robicheaux is arrested for murder.  Once he posts bond, he travels to Montana to find Mapes.  What he discovers there is a complicated scheme involving both the oil drilling company and the mob trying to cheat Native Americans out of their land.  Robicheaux's former partner, Cletus Purcel, is involved and working for the mob.  They parted under bad circumstances in Neon Rain, but slowly, Robicheaux comes to forgive and depend on Purcel.<br /><br />Burke writes about Louisiana and New Orleans as a person with a true love affair for this area.  In his writings and descriptions in Black Cherry Blues, it is obvious that he also has a strong affection for Montana.  But Burke's formula hasn't changed any and Robicheaux continues to lack subtlety or discretion as he tries to clear his name.  As one federal agent tells him, \\"you want to write your own rules on a day-to-day basis.\\"  Also, for a smart cop, Robicheaux always manages to walk into an ambush without a clue.  It's a stretch that Robicheaux is still alive after all the scrapes he gets into, book after book.<br /><br />Still, Black Cherry Blues is a fine book despite some minor flaws, and Burke has become one of my favorites.	2005-09-07

Heaven's Prisoners by James Lee Burke is the second book in his Dave Robicheaux mystery series.  While Burke's series has grown to be one of the best ever, in Heaven's Prisoners, he's still in the growing stage.<br /><br />Since book one, Neon Rain, Robicheaux has quit the New Orleans Police Department, cashed in his pension and bought a boat-and-bait business on a bayou in New Iberia.  He has also married Annie Ballard.  They have tried to settle into a quiet life, but it's just not in Robicheaux's nature.  Robicheaux and Annie are boating on the Gulf when they see a plane go down.  Robicheaux straps on his scuba tank, and is able to rescue a small girl (the four adults are already dead).  The girl is a Salvadoran refugee and Robicheaux and Annie name her Alafair and decide to raise her as their own.  But when federal authorities report that only three bodies were onboard the plane, Robicheaux starts investigating the identity of the mystery man and the reason for the cover-up.  He is first visited by the DEA and Immigration.  Then he is threatened by mob enforcers and told to mind his own business.  It soon becomes obvious that the Iberian Sheriff's Department is clueless (the sheriff runs a dry cleaning business with greater efficiency), so Robicheaux reluctantly joins the sheriff's department as a deputy.<br /><br />Heaven's Prisoners follows the same formula of most Burke books.  Robicheaux stumbles onto something illegal or suspicious.  When he starts investigating, he gets threatened and warned off by some bad guys (mobsters, feds, crooked cops and/or unscrupulous businessmen).  Robicheaux can't just leave things alone, and the situation quickly escalates.  He's not the bumbling Inspector Columbo, armed with only a wrinkled trench coat.  Instead, he bursts on the scene with a loaded and cocked .45.  And then something catastrophic occurs.<br /><br />This book is Burke's darkest book yet, and Robicheaux deals with his alcoholism, Viet Nam flashbacks and death.  While he claims to loathe \\"the political hypocrisy and the addictive, brutal ugliness of metropolitan law enforcement,\\" Robicheaux finally admits that he actually \\"loved the adrenaline rush of danger\\" and his \\"feelings of power over an evil world.\\"  Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of his family.<br /><br />What made reading this book especially sobering was reading it immediately after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina to New Orleans and southern Louisiana.  Burke has a true love affair with NOLA and the bayou, and I hope that this area can be brought back to its former beauty (rural areas, towns and cities alike).  Burke quotes an eerily prophetic set of lyrics from a John Fogerty song that read: \\"Don't come `round tonight/It's bound to take your life/A bad moon's on the rise/I hear hurricane's a blowing/I know the end is coming soon/I feel the river overflowing/I can hear the voice of rage and ruin.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed Heaven's Prisoners and it definitely filled in more gaps about Robicheaux's background.  Also, Burke continues to be a master of down-home witticisms.  One of my favorites is \\"I'm floating around on an ice cube that's melting in a toilet.\\"  I have two more books on deck, but then I think I'm going to take a little break.

After reading two Dave Robicheaux mysteries by James Lee Burke, I decided to read this series from the very beginning.  Neon Rain is the 1st book in the now 14 book series and was extremely helpful in filling in the blanks of Robicheaux's past that are only hinted at in later books.<br /><br />Neon Rain opens in New Orleans where Robicheaux is a lieutenant in the New Orleans Police Department.  He lives on a houseboat in Lake Pontchatrain, is recently divorced, is a Viet Nam vet and a recovering alcoholic.  He carries around more than his fair share of scars and baggage.  A man on death row at Angola Prison asks to see Robicheaux hours before he is executed, and informs Robicheaux that there is a contract out on his life.  Robicheaux is just as surprised as anybody, but it involves the chance discovery of a young black prostitute floating dead in a bayou.  In trying to solve the mystery of the contract, the lieutenant stumbles upon lots of graft and corruption in New Orleans that starts with prostitution and drugs, and ends up with murder, tax fraud, and smuggling arms to Central America.  It's sometimes hard to figure out who are the bad guys, who are informants and who are the government agents.  And the more involved Robicheaux becomes, the more dangerous his life comes.<br /><br />This is a good start for Burke, although the plot got a little confusing in spots. Robicheaux is a loose canon, and it's hard to tell why his boss thinks he's such a good cop.  He can be brutal and violent and unreasonable.  And he never follows any rules.  Also, Robicheaux becomes romantically involved with Annie Ballard, but I couldn't figure out why she was attracted to him.  Still, Burke is a master of description and observation.  Some of my favorites include \\"Reason is a word I always associated with bureaucrats, paper shufflers, and people who formed committees that were never intended to solve anything.\\"  Or \\"My father didn't read or write, but in many ways he learned more from hunting and fishing in the marsh than I had from my years of college education and experience as a policeman.\\"  And finally, in comparing himself to a general who also served in Viet Nam, Robicheaux muses \\"Like those Confederate soldiers buried under the lawn of Jefferson Davis's home, some people share historical real estate that will always be their private country.\\"<br /><br />The good news is that Burke took this good book and turned it into a terrific series.  I plan on reading them all.re from hunting and fishing in the marsh than I had from my years of college education and experience as a policeman.\\"  And finally, in comparing himself to a general who also served in Viet Nam, Robicheaux muses \\"Like those Confederate soldiers buried under the lawn of Jefferson Davis's home, some people share historical real estate that will always be their private country.\\"   <br /> <br />The good news is that Burke took this good book and turned it into a terrific series.

After reading two Dave Robicheaux mysteries by James Lee Burke, I was anxious to read a novel by this author.  White Doves at Morning is actually a historical fiction based on the lives of Burke's great-grandfather and great-great-uncle.<br /><br />White Doves is set in New Iberia at the outbreak of the Civil War.  New Iberia is in the Louisiana Bayou-the same locale as his Robicheaux series.  The tart-tongued Willie Burke is the son of an Irish woman who runs a boarding house.  Robert Perry is the son of rich plantation owners.  Yet these two lads are fast friends and they find themselves pulled into the Civil War.  Their roads take them down separate paths during the war.  Perry (by virtue of his birth) is an officer and gets shipped up to Virginia.  Willie starts out as a private and begins his enlistment at the Battle of Shiloh.  I found the parts that involve the war to be the most engrossing in White Doves.  Despite not really believing in the principles of the war, Willie distinguishes himself and eventually becomes an officer as well.  But unfortunately, I think that Burke lost some of his momentum after the war ended.  What happens afterward is too contrived and too rushed.  And things just worked out a little too nicely (something that certainly wouldn't have happened during the long and ugly period of Reconstruction).<br /><br />Burke also deals with many issues back home in New Iberia. The beautiful Abigail Dowling, is an abolitionist from Massachusetts.  Both Perry and Willie are in love with her, although they have a hard time reconciling her politics to their actions (unknown to them, she is actually part of the Underground Railroad).  Willie has taken a liking to an intelligent slave girl, Flower Jamison, and teaches her how to read and write. Flower is the daughter of a plantation owner, Ira Jamison, who is ruthless and refuses to recognize Flower as his daughter.  There are more than enough villains in White Doves, and Burke describes many of them as \\"white trash.\\"  Some of them will get their just rewards, while others will form the beginnings of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />White Doves at Morning is a decent book, and Burke's characters are engaging and his writing is always first rate.  His descriptions of Louisiana are a work of art.  But I just think that he got bogged down with the plot somewhere along the line.

Last Car to Elysian Fields is my second James Lee Burke mystery in a row, and I'm afraid that I've been infected by the Dave Robicheaux bug.  I won't be happy until I've read all fourteen books in this series.<br /><br />In Elysian Fields, Robicheaux is a detective in the Iberia sheriff's department.  He has a host of demons that he's battling (several ex-wives, a recent personal loss, and white knuckled abstinence from alcohol-just to name a few).  But he is also juggling quite a few cases, and not all of them are \\"official.\\"  The case of a disappearing bluesman from Angola prison is over 50 years old.  Also on his plate are the deaths of three underage teenagers who purchased alcohol at a daiquiri bar, pornography and meth ring, a priest friend who was brutally assaulted, an electrician doing shoddy work, a granddaughter who has been cheated out of her grandfather's land, and illegal dumping by chemical companies.  Add to that a crazed hit man from Miami, and a bunch of dead bodies, and Robicheaux's life becomes even more complicated.  Sometimes it's difficult to figure out who has a hit on who.<br /><br />Burke excels when it comes to his characters.  Helen Solileau, is Robicheaux's boss and a woman of great insight and patience.  Robicheaux tests her in so many ways, but Solileau knows that Robicheaux is a good but unorthodox cop and she tries to give him a long leash.  But my very favorite character is Robicheaux's best friend and former partner, Cletus Purcel.  Cletus is now a PI and part-time bounty hunter who spreads mayhem and chaos in his wake.  Each book has at least a few good scenes where Cletus is up to his old tricks including he \\"filled a New Orleans' gangster's vintage automobile with cement, destroyed a half-million-dollar home on Lake Pontchartrain with an earth grader,\\" and \\"cuffed a dirty cop to the conveyor chain in a car-wash and hot-wax machine.\\"  Only a person living in Louisiana can do these things and not spend quality time in jail. Burke also does a good job with hitman, Max Coll.  Coll is a bizarre, tortured and destructive character, yet seems to have a conscience of sorts.<br /><br />I have definitely become a James Lee Burke convert, and I just printed out all the titles of his Robicheaux series in order.

US	53052945	RBP9IYKYET906	0786889004	47168285	Dixie City Jam	Books	4	19	19	N	N	Mike Hammer meets Spenser...	After reading a bunch of bestseller but lackluster mysteries this summer, it was wonderful to discover an author of some substance-James Lee Burke.  Dixie City Jam (the Dave Robicheaux series) reads more like a mystery written by a novelist, and Burke's literary style is unmatched by most mystery writers today.<br /><br />Dave Robicheaux, a former New Orleans PD policeman, is now a detective with the New Iberia sheriff's office.  Robicheaux discovered a Nazi u-boat in Gulf waters, and now a number of people are lining up to find the sub's location.  Will Buchalter is a spooky, brutal, neo-Nazi who is willing to stop at nothing to get his hands on the sub, and haunts Robicheaux and his family (leaving dead bodies in his wake).  There are also several subplots involving drug deals, prostitution, mobsters, crooked cops, and a vigilante murderer killing drug dealers and cutting out their hearts.<br /><br />Burke's characters are a colorful bunch, and Robicheaux's former partner and now PI, Cletus Purcel, is probably the best of the bunch. He will have you in stitches as he goes against the mob.  New Orleans is also a major player in Dixie City Jam, and the sultry, sensuous, steamy city (the locals call it The Big Sleazy) provides a fitting backdrop.<br /><br />Burke's writing is top notch, and his dialog between characters reads like Mike Hammer meets Spenser.  Robicheaux has a background in literature (something rare in law enforcement) and it's easy to see that Burke is a serious writer who shares a love of literature with his fictional detective.  Burke has received a number of deserved literary awards and was even nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.<br /><br />The only negative about Dixie City Jam is that some of it seemed a bit unbelievable.  How Buchalter could have gone on a crime spree lasting decades while eluding detection or capture was a stretch.  But this doesn't detract from this otherwise fabulous book.  Burke is another writer who I'm now motivated to read everything he's written.  I've already started Last Car to Elysian Fields.ed to read everything he's written.

Nevada Barr is fast becoming one of my favorite mystery writers, and Flashback is one of the best mysteries I've read this summer.  National Park Service Ranger, Anna Pigeon, has been transferred to Dry Tortugas National Park as a temporary supervisory ranger.  The Dry Tortugas are off the Florida Keys, and Garden Key (part of the national park) is the home of Fort Jefferson.  This fort served as a military installation and also, a jail during and after the Civil War.<br /><br />Soon after Anna arrives, mysterious events start happening.  A fellow ranger disappears, a speedboat explodes and sinks with at least one victim, and Anna starts to think she's going crazy (the malady that caused her predecessor to take a short-term leave).  At first, it appears that these things are unrelated, but Anna eventually starts to piece this puzzle together.  At the same time, she begins reading letters written by her great aunt, Raffia Coleman.  Raffia's husband was an officer at Ft. Jefferson during the Civil War, and she writes copious letters to her sister about the trials and tribulations of living on the fort.  There was also a mystery at the fort in 1865, and soon, the boundaries between past and present are soon blurred.  Barr alternates the chapters between past and present, and each one ends in a cliffhanger, with the intensity mounting with each chapter.  It is difficult to tell if Anna will escape this book with her life and/or her sanity.<br /><br />As with all Barr books, we learn something new about another National Park.  The Dry Tortugas was named because the keys were filled with turtles and there was no fresh water source.  Dr. Samuel Mudd was the most famous prisoner on Garden Key, and he is best known for treating John Wilkes Booth's leg after Booth assassinated Abraham Lincoln.  He was eventually pardoned because of his heroics treating yellow fever victims at Fort Jefferson.  Barr weaves him into the story, but in an entirely fictional way.<br /><br />I have two complaints about Flashback, but one is that of my own doing-I haven't read them in order.  Also, I was just a bit confused when she first switched to the flashback mode.  But at least the good news is that I still have nine more books to go.r />I have two complaints about Flashback, but one is that of my own doing-I haven't read them in order.

Ill Wind by Nevada Barr is the third book in her Anna Pigeon series, and the fourth book that I've read.  The more I read of Barr, the more impressed I am with her mysteries.<br /><br />National Park Service Ranger, Anna Pigeon, finds herself working in Mesa Verde National Park, home of the Anasazi ruins.  This is a delicate assignment, trying to share the park with the public, while protecting the delicate ruins.  When bad things start happening, one of the park employees claim it is the chindi (or spirits) of the Anasazi, who are protesting the desecration of their sacred sites.  Each of these events is preceded by the appearance of a \\"spirit veil\\" over the ruins the night before.  But when a fellow ranger is found dead under mysterious circumstances, the National Park Service calls in agent Frederick Stanton of the FBI.<br /><br />There are many theories as to what is happening in Mesa Verde.  Although unhappy spirits are not ruled out, the lack of truthfulness with almost everyone involved makes for lots of suspicious characters.  Pigeon and Stanton work together to a thrilling conclusion.<br /><br />As with Tony Hillerman, I enjoy Barr's novels in that they teach the reader something new with each book.  With Ill Wind, we not only learn more about the NPS, but also, the mysterious Anasazi and the ruins they left behind.  It's an unsolved mystery why this civilization lived here for 600 years, and then disappeared without a trace.  We also learn more about Ranger Anna Pigeon with each book.  I would have given it five stars if it hadn't dragged a bit at the beginning.  Still, I have already started reading another Barr, Flashback.	2005-08-17

I thought I discovered buried treasure in the library when I stumbled across \\"I Love a Roosevelt: The inside story of the Roosevelt children by Elliott Roosevelt's irrepressible wife.\\"  This book, written by Patricia Peabody Roosevelt (Elliott Roosevelt's fifth wife) is the bottom of the barrel of the 100 plus Roosevelt books that I have read.<br /><br />Instead of focusing on Franklin and Eleanor's children, I Love a Roosevelt dwells instead on the author and her husband. The Roosevelt children were a dysfunctional group, and Elliott was the worst of the bunch.  They were selfish, they were spoiled, they were jealous and they were undisciplined.  The fact that the five children had 19 marriages between them demonstrates that they weren't very good at relationships.  Elliott always tried to live life as the big man, and exploited the Roosevelt name to try and achieve this.  Success was never in his grasp as he bounced from one get-rich-quick scheme to the next.<br /><br />Elliott constantly had money problems, but even when things were bad, he still lived the rich lifestyle.  In a continuing effort to pay off his debts, he signed away his inheritance, gave up and sold Roosevelt heirlooms, and even sold Hyde Park lands and FDR's beloved Top Cottage.  He also looked for constant handouts from his mother and brothers.  His actions alienated not just Eleanor, but all his siblings as well.  Once he had nothing left so sell, he started writing books.  Several were unflattering and disloyal diatribes about Eleanor.  Then he started a mystery series with Eleanor as sleuth.  His family (siblings) never forgave him.<br /><br />Author Patty Roosevelt tries to put a positive spin on their life, but readers will see through the façade.  Even she writes that \\"marriage to Elliott Roosevelt began to resemble a celluloid epic\\" and that \\"we were on a never-ending emotional binge.\\"  I Love a Roosevelt is a failed and shallow attempt to redeem her husband and to try to convince readers that she was different from Elliott's previous wives.  I almost gagged on the many terms of endearment that Elliott and Patty used (sweetie, darling, dear, etc.).  It seemed so very phony, but I guess this was safer for Elliott (who probably had a problem keeping wives straight).<br /><br />One other major shortcoming is that fact that this book only covers 8 years, from 1959-1967.  There is nothing about FDR and very little about Eleanor (the author only met her about a half dozen times before Eleanor died in 1962).  What she does write about Eleanor is not very endearing. Also, since Elliott lived until 1990, I Love a Roosevelt provides only a very small window in Elliott's life.<br /><br />I'm sorry that I wasted my time on I Love a Roosevelt, and wish the library had tossed this book long ago.  If you're interested in reading the true story about FDR and Eleanor's dysfunctional brood, Peter Collier's The Roosevelt's is a much better and more fascinating book.nce readers that she was different from Elliott's previous wives.

When Henry Wiencek was doing background work for a book on old houses, he visited a plantation home in North Carolina called Cooleemee.  Cooleemee has been owned continuously by the Hairston family, and the present owner is Judge Peter W. Hairston.  Wiencek asked Hairston if he knew of any descendents of Cooleemee slaves, and he was introduced to Squire Hairston.  This chance encounter lead Wiencek on a seven year odyssey to discover the history of not just the white Hairston family, but the black Hairston's as well.  The Hairstons: An American Family in Black and White is an incredibly fascinating book that reflects not just the history of one family, but the story of our nation.  Fortunately for his readers, Wiencek writes this historical narrative to read like a novel.<br /><br />The Hairston's were once one of the richest plantation families.  Together, they owned 45 plantations in three states, and Samuel Hairston was said to own over 10,000 slaves (the most slaves ever owned by one person).  The Hairston's tended to marry other Hairston's to keep the plantations in the family.  But their way of life changed forever after the Civil War.  While the fortunes of the white Hairston's never recovered, the black Hairston's were able to make something of their lives.  Due to perseverance and discipline, they became engineers, farmers, musicians, lawyers, teachers, farmers, principals and ministers.<br /><br />Slaves in the Family by Edward Ball covers a similar subject matter, but Wiencek's book gives us much more of a historical perspective.  The history of the Hairston's in American begins around 1729 and continues to the present.  The author touches on the Revolution, the Abolitionist Movement, the Civil War, Reconstruction, Jim Crow, the Civil Rights Movement, blacks in the military and integration.  These stories are all told through the eyes of the Hairston clan.  Much of the success of The Hairstons: An American Family is due to Judge Peter.  He opened his home and his archives (over 25,000 documents) to Wiencek and never put any conditions on where the author's research might lead.  Cooleemee is also always open to his black brethren, and he embraced these Hairston \\"kin\\" with open arms.  When Squire Hairston passed away, Judge Peter sat in the front row of the church and sobbed uncontrollably.<br /><br />What truly drives this book are the themes of love and friendship, forgiveness and redemption, and loyalty and reconciliation.  We also see how determination, perseverance and faith can overcome so many obstacles.  The Hairston family exhibits great family pride, and over a thousand black Hairston's gather each year for a reunion.  Wiencek will also have you running an emotional gamut from incredulity to outrage to finally, hope.  You will see that despite the horrible history of slavery and prejudice, both sides of the Hairston clan have come together in a spirit of forgiveness and acceptance (something the relatives of Edward Ball were not able to do).  Wiencek also did extensive research to discover the truth behind many family mysteries.  In some respects, it reads more like a mystery, although he wasn't able to solve all the unanswered questions.<br /><br />My only complaints about The Hairstons are minor ones:  the family tree was a bit confusing in spots.  Also, I thought the picture selections could have been better, and there could have been more of them.  A map of the Mississippi plantations would have also been helpful.  But please don't let these small problems detract from an otherwise excellent book.

Once in a great while, a first novel is published possessing such scope and beauty as to be considered a masterpiece.  The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini is just such a book.  The Kite Runner touched my heart the way few books have been able.  It also screams from the rooftops that Hosseini is an incredibly talented writer-a fete even more amazing considering that he has a fulltime career as a medical doctor.<br /><br />Amir is a young boy growing up in Afghanistan with his father, Baba.  Baba is a well respected and affluent businessman, and they have a very comfortable life.  Baba has a personal servant whose son was born the same time as Amir, and Amir and Hassan are raised together and become fast friends.  Things go well until Amir witnesses an event of horrible proportions, and because of fear or cowardice, chooses not to act.  His behavior will change all their lives forever.  At first, Amir's guilt is overwhelming and he behaves in a cruel manner.  Then he tries to repress his actions, but they continue to haunt him into adulthood.  When he finally gets the opportunity to atone for his past, you won't be able to turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />Hosseini gives us a glimpse of the political situation in Afghanistan as the novel takes us from the monarchy to the republic to the Russian invasion to the Taliban.  Amir and his father escape to the United States during the Russian occupation, but we still learn of the continually changing political climate in Afghanistan and the tragic consequences of these changes.  The author also touches on the differences between Sunni and Shi'a Muslims-something very timely in the current events of today.  But where Hosseini truly excels is in the theme of redemption and the universal struggle to come to grips with the past.  He also does a stellar job of portraying a relationship between a father and his son (one of the most complicated of relationships).<br /><br />In The Kite Runner, the young Amir grows up to be a writer of some renown.  I hope that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy for Hosseini.  I also hope that this talented doctor can find enough free time from his professional duties to write another book that will match this masterwork.to be a writer of some renown.

Mohawk centers around two first cousins, Anne Younger and Diane Wood, and their families.  Anne has always been in love with Diane's husband, Dan.  Dan is a paraplegic as the result of an accident.  Anne's ne'er-do-well husband, Dallas, never seems to do right by the people he loves.  Anna's son, Randall, starts slacking in school as he seems more accepted when his grades start sliding.  Diane's mother has a hissy fit and needs to be hospitalized every time she doesn't get her on way.  Anne's mother tortures both Anne and her father.  And Mather Grouse (Anna's father) lives his life by a moral code that affects everyone in his family.  Mohawk is a book of unlikely heroes as people try to make right of the past.<br /><br />Russo is a master of observation and turns this talent into an art form.  Some of those that touched a nerve include:<br /><br />When discussing dealing with her husband, \\"Mrs. Grouse had come to see virtually everything he enjoyed as a potential source of upset.  She seemed intent on making his remaining years one long Lenten season.\\"<br /><br />\\"the most effective lies were those liberally laced with truth.  The lie could be ninety-nine parts truth to one part falsehood, one tarnished part mingling with the pure until it was all tainted, more false than pure fabrication.\\"<br /><br />Mather Grouse \\"certainly understood how perversely loyal human beings could be to mistakes.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately, Russo is not as prolific as other writers, although perhaps that is what makes his books so special.  I've already read Straight Man, Empire Falls and Nobody's Fool.  So I guess I'll just have to content myself with going back and reading some of his earlier works instead.prolific as other writers, although perhaps that is what makes his books so special.

Most people know the tragic fate of the last tsar and his family, and rumors have swirled for almost a century about possible survivors.  When the remains were exhumed in 1991 and the skeletons of two of the royal children were missing, it just added fuel to the fire.  Berry took the known facts, and added lots of fantasy to embellish this tale.  But somewhere along the line, he dropped the ball.<br /><br />The Romanov Prophecy opens in modern day Russia.  The Russian people are tired of the lawlessness and economic uncertainty that have plagued their country since the fall of communism, and have decided to restore the monarchy.  A 17 member independent Tsarist Commission has been appointed to find the \\"true\\" tsar.  There are nine or ten Romanov claimants that need to be investigated.  Stefan Baklanov seems to be the frontrunner, and his claim is bolstered by a secret group consisting of government officials, the military, the Russian Orthodox Church, the Russian Mafia and a group of American businessmen with companies in Russia.  Their goal is to bribe the members of the Tsarist Commission to make sure Stefan assumes the crown, and then control the new tsar like a puppet.  The American's are financing this plot through an American law firm, Pridgen and Woodworth.<br /><br />The main character, Miles Lord, is an African American lawyer from South Carolina who speaks fluent Russian.  An employee of Pridgen and Woodworth, his job is to sift through Russian archives to find anything that might affect Baklanov's claim to the throne.  After weeks of research, Lord finds documents (one from Lenin) that allude to the fact that several of Tsar Nicholas II's children survived the massacre in Yekaterinburg.  But this new evidence now proves dangerous to Lord, and those representing Baklanov now want Lord killed.  Lord gains the assistance of a beautiful acrobat in the Russian Circus, and together, they try to flee those trying to kill him.  He is assisted by a secret organization, and must find clues and solve puzzles to discover the true secret of the Romanov's fate. Of course, he also must travel extensively at breakneck speed.  In this sense, The Romanov Prophecy reads like John Grisham meets Dan Brown (The DaVinci Code).<br /><br />While I enjoy historical fiction and I am not opposed to a little fantasy, The Romanov Prophecy is just too unbelievable.  The fact that the Russian's would restore the monarchy is perhaps the biggest stretch of all.  Also, do we really think that so many Russian factions (mafia, church, military, etc.) would all agree on anything?  Or that two Russian mafia goons and a corrupt policeman could travel the world chasing Lord, without any problems with passports and visas?  Or that the FBI and American police would be so easily fooled by the Russians without double checking? Or that the KGB has informants in US banks where they monitor bank accounts and safety deposit boxes that might still contain tsarist gold?  Also, Lord is supposed to be a brilliant lawyer, but he's totally clueless in figuring out who is betraying him (it takes more than a house to fall on Lord).<br /><br />So while I enjoyed The Romanov Prophecy and was anxious to see how it played out, I just think it had the potential to be so much more.

For vacation, I picked up quite a few books that had beach and or southern themes.  Out of the many I've read, Nevada Barr's Deep South is the best one so far.<br /><br />Anna Pigeon is a National Park Service ranger who transfers to the Natchez Trace as part of a promotion.  Ranger Pigeon isn't even officially on duty when events start happening at a furious pace.  The worst is that a local teenaged girl is found murdered after her prom.  Anna is faced with a variety of obstacles that include nasty alligators, racism, sexism, disgruntled colleagues, a bunch of teenagers reluctant to tell the truth and southerners who dislike Yankees.  Pigeon must also become acclimated to her new home, The Natchez Trace National Park, a lush, beautiful but forbidding place that doesn't give up her secrets very readily.<br /><br />One aspect of Barr's books that is most enjoyable is the education she gives us on the National Park Service and the parks that play key roles in her novels.  The Natchez Trace is actually 444 miles, and is rich in both Native American and Civil War history.  I have never visited this area, but Deep South has certainly peaked my interest.<br /><br />Barr's characters are also so believable.  All of them are flawed in some way or another.  None of them is a true hero.  But most of them look into their souls and try to do the right thing.  The plot was very good and Deep South ended with a bang.<br /><br />I've only read one other Barr novel, but I need to start seeking out her other books.  She certainly has found her own niche in the mystery genre.	2005-07-28

I vacation near Charleston several times a year, so it was only natural that I stumbled onto Dorothea Benton Frank.  Her first novel, Sullivan's Island, was a breath of fresh air.  Frank was smart, sassy, hysterically funny and her characters were a hoot.  Shem Creek is her fourth novel, and it think that she has lost the edge that she showed in her earlier works.  In fact, I think Shem Creek is too much like her third novel, Isle of Palms.  It's terribly predictable and you can tell how this book will play out from the first chapter.<br /><br />Linda Breland is a southern transplant who has been living in Montclair, NJ with her two teenaged daughters.  Her marriage is over, she hates her life, she hates her job and she particularly hates New Jersey winters.  Her youngest daughter is totally out of control.  So she decides to pull up stakes and move back to her hometown, Mt. Pleasant, SC.  She gets a job as a restaurant manager (a job for which she has no experience), immediately becomes great friends with the restaurant employees (they become a surrogate extended family), and rents a great boathouse at a price too good to be true.  In fact, much of this book sounds too good to be believable.  Most of the book is written through the eyes of Linda, but several chapters switch to different characters.  It became very confusing-sometimes I had to go back and re-read paragraphs to figure out who was talking.<br /><br />Still, there is much to redeem Shem Creek.  Frank is good at giving us southern witticisms and observations.  She describes someone as being \\"tackier than white shoes after Labor Day.\\"  In predicting trouble, she writes \\"there ain't no quicker way to bring the devil to your door than for him to think you're having a party without him.\\"  She describes someone's speech by saying \\"There was a civil war going on in her accent.  In one breath she was Scarlet, and in the next moment she was a flawless Edith Bunker.\\"  It's good stuff.  Frank also provides us with several recipes in the back for biscuits and pound cake.  They sound heavenly and play a prominent role in Shem Creek.  I'll definitely try them.<br /><br />So while I thought that Shem Creek didn't live up to Frank's previous efforts, I haven't given up on Frank and will definitely read her new novel, Pawley's Island.s us with several recipes in the back for biscuits and pound cake.

She now heads San Francisco's homicide division.  The calm of San Francisco shatters when it appears that a serial killer is again at work. At first, the targets are black and they seem to be random shootings.  But Boxer figures out that all the victims have ties to the police. The killer leaves a trademark: a drawing of an unusual sort-part lion, part goat and part snake.  The Women's Murder Club (Lindsey and her three gal-pals) discover that this is the symbol of a white supremacist hate group from prison. But they're especially upset to learn that this just might be an inside job.  As with most Patterson books, just when you think the story has ended, there is a lot more still left.<br /><br />One interesting aspect of 2nd Chance is that it gives the reader a look inside the politics of a homicide case.  The African-American residents of San Francisco demand justice.  The mayor pressures the chief of police to make a quick arrest.  The chief of police breathes down the neck of Boxer and her staff for a quick solution, while his PR people try to put a positive spin on things.  The longer the case goes unsolved, the more victims there are. And the FBI is forever on the sidelines, waiting for the chance to muscle in on the case.  I'm sure it's something that goes on during all high-profile cases in big cities, but of which most of us are unaware.<br /><br />Since I read these books out of order, I'll next be hopping to book four, 4th of July. But I think I'll wait for the paperback version.  Most of Patterson's books are one day reads, and I can't see spending the money for a hardback.	2005-07-19

After being terribly disappointed with James Patterson's Beach House, I immediately begin his First to Die.  I'm happy to report that this book is more of what we should expect from a best-selling author.  First to Die is the first book in his Women's Murder Club series, of which there are now four.<br /><br />First to Die is written mainly in the voice of Lindsey Boxer.  Boxer is a homicide detective for the San Francisco Police Department.  When a newlywed couple is found brutally murdered just hours after their wedding (still attired in wedding regalia), Boxer is put on the case.  Two other couples are also murdered, but one is in Napa and the other in Cleveland.  Boxer is unsure whether there is a serial killer at work as even the methods of murder are different.  But it is up to her to try to find the common denominator.<br /><br />Boxer's best friend is San Francisco medical examiner Claire Washburn.  The two of them befriend a crime reporter from the Chronicle, Cindy Thomas, and an assistant DA, Jill Bernhardt.  Together, they dub themselves the Women's Murder Club.  When the case seems to be going nowhere, the various women use their skills to crack open the case, a little at a time.<br /><br />This book will take you on a roller coaster ride from start to finish.  And even when it seems that Boxer has the case all wrapped up, there is still one more twisting turn at the very end.  My only regret is that I started this series with book three, Third Degree.	2005-07-18

I picked up a number of books for a beach vacation, and thought James Patterson's Beach House would be perfect for the trip.  Unfortunately, this is one of the hokiest mysteries I've ever read.  Usually I enjoy James Patterson, but this book was a big disappointment.<br /><br />A Long Island native, Jack Mullen is a senior at Columbia Law when his younger brother is murdered. Peter Mullen is a likable but aimless lad who likes to live on the edge.  He was parking cars for a rich CEO in the Hamptons when he disappears.  His body washes up on the beach the next day, and he's been brutally beaten.  But the chief of police claims it was an accidental drowning or a suicide-even though the medical examiner rules otherwise.  It soon becomes apparent that there is a massive cover-up going on, and the rich CEO, Barry Neubauer, is at the top of the list.<br /><br />Jack and his buddies decide that they're going to have to discover the truth for themselves.  They are threatened, fired from their jobs, and the person who wants to keep the truth buried has lots of power, money and very long arms.  It is at this point that the story loses all credibility, but I can't divulge why without giving away the plot.<br /><br />Perhaps part of the problem with Beach House is that it is co-written by Peter De Jonge. Also, Patterson generally keeps his chapters short (two or three pages at most).  This 356 page book has 113 chapters with a blank page or so between each one.  Without the wasted paper, Beach House could have been at least 33% shorter.  At least you can read it in a day.<br /><br />I'm now halfway through Patterson's First to Die, and I'm enjoying it very much.  So I guess that even good writers can produce a clunker now and then.	2005-07-16

I purchased Islands by Anne Rivers Siddons to take on a vacation to the Low Country of Charleston, SC.  Islands is set in Charleston, Sullivan's Island, Edisto and John's Island, so I thought it would be the perfect book.  While I enjoyed most of Islands, it morphed into something really bizarre at the end.<br /><br />Anny Butler is the director of a Charleston children's welfare agency.  In the course of her work, she meets orthopedic doctor and native Charlestonian, Lewis Aiken.  Aiken falls in love with the spinster Butler (hard to figure out why) and after a whirlwind courtship, they are married.  By virtue of their marriage, Anny becomes part of \\"the Scrubs.\\"  The Scrubs consist of four couples, most native Charlestonians.  Four of them work in the medical field, and thus the name.  The Scrubs have purchased a beach house on Sullivan's Island, and they spend almost every weekend there together.  The first day Anny meets the Scrubs, they pledge that when they start failing, they will move in together and take care of each other.  Over time, events happen that will change the dynamics of the Scrubs including a hurricane, fires, deaths and infidelity.  Three of them take their vow to each other seriously.  But story evolves into one of love gone awry, obsession and revenge.<br /><br />Islands definitely lacks credibility.  Dr. Aikens owns a house on The Battery, a house on Bull Street, a big plantation on Edisto and the beach house with the Scrubs.  Months and sometimes, years go by without Lewis or Anny using one house or the other.  When tragedies occur, most of the Scrubs are likely to abandon one house (without selling it, of course) and purchase something new.  They are also likely to disappear for months at a time (don't know of many jobs where such things are possible).  The Scrubs forsake their families, children and grandchildren for the sake of the group.  And it's a stretch to think that a young librarian would abandon her career (and in some cases, her 7 year old daughter) to become a cook, cleaner and caretaker.<br /><br />Still, Islands has two great things going for it: the Charleston Low Country and Siddons' rich, lyric writing.  Charleston is always a wonderful backdrop, and it was especially interesting reading about how hurricane Hugo affected the locals. Siddons' descriptions of the Low Country can be pure poetry, and only Pat Conroy surpasses her in this regard.<br /><br />So while Islands wasn't quite as good as I had hoped, it was still a good book for a vacation-especially to the Low Country.her 7 year old daughter) to become a cook, cleaner and caretaker.   <br /> <br />Still, Islands has two great things going for it: the Charleston Low Country and Siddons' rich, lyric writing.

John Grisham's readers have come to expect fast-paced action, a riveting plot and decent characters in his works.  Unfortunately, in The Broker, he fails on all three counts.  Grisham's last six books or so have been hot and cold, and The Broker can best be described as tepid.<br /><br />Former powerbroker and hotshot DC attorney, Joel Backman, is serving a 20 year jail sentence for selling military secrets.  He found himself in possession of a sophisticated satellite software program, and tried to sell it to various countries.  As an inept and unpopular president gets ready to leave office, corrupt CIA director, Teddy Maynard, bribes the president to pardon Joel Backman (only 6 years into his jail term).  He plans to plop Backman down into a foreign country under CIA watch, and then leak his whereabouts to those countries wishing Backman dead.<br /><br />It is here that The Broker becomes the Italian travelogue and coffee diary.  Backman is relocated to Bologna.  With the help of a private tutor, he starts learning the language. He learns nouns...he learns adjectives...he learns adverbs...he learns verbs...he learns verb tenses, etc.  You get the picture.  Then he goes out for sumptuous meals, which are described in great detail (all at government expense, of course).  Then he starts seeing the sites.  He tours churches, cathedrals, towers, etc. and we get the history and description of each.  And finally, he stops for a cup of coffee, cappuccino or espresso at least 5-6 times a day.  Without all this \\"stuffing,\\" the book could have been 50% shorter.<br /><br />The climax to The Broker is very unsatisfying and the ending rather weak.  Grisham leaves things a bit open-ended and we can only hope that it's not because we'll be seeing these characters again.  There weren't many that were very likable.  Hopefully Grisham will let them rest in peace.<br /><br />So read The Broker if you're a Grisham fan, but don't expect one of his better works.	2005-07-12

Me Talk Pretty One Day is the 3rd book I've read by David Sedaris in short succession, and it's the best one thus far.  Like Holidays on Ice and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, it's filled with the Sedaris trademark self-deprecating humor.  But unlike the previous two books, it has much less of a dark-side.  The 28 stories are almost divided in two.  The first part of the book is dedicated to American living.  The second half deals with his trying to survive as an American living in France.<br /><br />The stories about France are the funniest of the bunch.  The French think Sedaris represents all Americans, and they're quick to scold him that American's are prudes (during the Clinton impeachment) or that their tariffs are too high (when the price of American products goes up).  The French are sometimes seen as aloof.  \\"The French have decided to ignore our self-proclaimed superiority, and this is translated as arrogance.  To my knowledge, they've never said that they're better than us; they've just never said that we're the best.\\"  Even more confusing is trying to figure out the French language.  All nouns are assigned a sex, and it's often something that defies logic.  \\"Hysteria, psychosis, torture, depression,\\" Niagara Falls, Georgia, Florida and New England are all feminine.<br /><br />\\"Murder, toothache, and Rollerblade,\\" sandwich, corn, string beans, the Grand Canyon, Montana, and Utah are all masculine.  Sedaris gives up trying to figure them out, and just orders things in two or more.  By using the plural, one uses the plural article rather than the article that reflects gender.  This gets a bit expensive when Sedaris starts ordering two appliances, chickens, etc.  It's also hard to store everything.<br /><br />One funny story has Sedaris taking an IQ test with Mensa.  He is crushed when he receives the results and discovers that he's not even close to being classified a genius.  Still, I think that Sedaris is a keen observer of life and a brilliant writer.

McCullough is one of America's foremost writers and historians and has scored major hits with such monumental works as Truman, John Adams and Mornings on Horseback.  While enjoyable, I don't feel that 1776 meets the high standards set in his earlier works.  David Hackett Fischer's brilliant Washington's Crossing is a much more fascinating look at the same time period and covers most of the same events.<br /><br />Part of McCullough's problem with 1776 is that the scope is so very short.  It begins in late 1775 with the siege of Boston, and ends in early 1777 with the Battle of Princeton. It is primarily a story about George Washington and the Continental Army, and military engagements between the Americans, British and Hessians.  The political events of this time period, including the Continental Congress and the Declaration of Independence, are given just a cursory mention.<br /><br />Still, this is a fascinating period in our early history, and it's a wonder that the American's were able to survive.  George Washington was largely untested, and many of those men he placed in leadership positions (especially Nathanael Greene and Henry Knox) were well read in military history but very short on military experience.  At first, Washington was often indecisive, and it cost him bitterly-especially in New York.  But the victories at Trenton and Princeton gave the army a much-needed boost, and lifted the flagging spirits of the young Americans.<br /><br />1776 proved to be a year of unbelievable contrasts.  The Americans suffered some crushing blows (Brooklyn, Long Island, White Plains, Fort Washington), while pulling off some major victories (the British departure from Boston, Trenton and Princeton).  Some of their successes bordered on miracles including the retrieving of cannon from Fort Ticonderoga, the taking of Dorchester Heights, and the successful and secret retreat from Brooklyn.  Both sides were at the mercy of the weather, but it often times seemed that the hand of God was at work for the Americans.  A three-day nor'easter kept the British from attacking Boston.  No wind often kept British ships from sailing at will, and a bizarre fog aided in their retreat from Brooklyn.  Still, conditions were harsh and most soldiers were ill prepared.  Enlistments were only for one year, and desertions were common.  But every time the Americans were at their lowest point, the British would pull back for one reason or another, instead of bringing a quick end to the battle for independence.<br /><br />McCullough's research is prodigious, and the journal entries and letters from \\"regular\\" soldiers were rather interesting.  Unfortunately, the Revolution continued for another 6-1/2 years, so 1776 is merely an introduction.  Also, it would have been nice if McCullough provided us with a brief epilogue.  I had to search the Internet to discover that the British eventually traded the vain, jealous and power-hungry Major General Charles Lee for one of their officers.  He finally got what was coming to him when he was court martialed for refusing to follow orders and the disrespect shown to Washington during the Battle of Monmouth.<br /><br />So, while 1776 is an engaging book, I just expected a little more.oth sides were at the mercy of the weather, but it often times seemed that the hand of God was at work for the Americans.

Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is my second book by David Sedaris after finishing Holidays on Ice (one of the funniest books, ever).  Unlike Holidays, Dress Your Family consists of 22 short stories that are all autobiographical in nature.<br /><br />Dress Your Family doesn't quite have the belly laughs of Holidays, but it is comical nonetheless.  One funny story is about his brother's wedding on the beach with his dogs as attendants (the flower girl was in heat).  In another, he plays strip poker with his friends and makes up the rules in order to keep his clothes.  Sedaris' self-deprecating humor is also amusing.  The author had an unusual childhood, and while most boys were picking up footballs and hockey sticks, Sedaris was picking out wallpaper samples.  But Dress Your Family is also filled with the angst of childhood, and most of us will identify with many of these stories.  Some are downright heartbreaking.  After dropping out of college, his father asks him to move out of the house.  Only later does Sedaris learn the real reason: his father disapproves of his homosexuality.<br /><br />Still, the Sedaris family has center stage here. With mom, dad, four sisters, and a very masculine brother, each one is quirkier than the next.  It's hard to tell how much is Sedaris' very keen powers of observation, and how much is exaggeration.  In any case, it's no wonder that when odd things happen to his sisters, they all scream at him \\"and I don't want to see this in one of your books!\\"  Sedaris always promises to keep their secrets, but everyone knows they will appear sometime soon.  Sedaris is an amazing writer and storyteller, and it is appropriate that he has such a rich source of material.  I'm sure it will keep him going ad infinitum.	2005-07-05

I have long been a Stephanie Plum/Janet Evanovich fan (a natural for a Jersey girl), but I was rather disappointed with some of her later books.  The plots were insipid, the characters were boring, and they just weren't as rip-roaring funny as we've come to expect.  But I'm happy to say that Evanovich is back on top of her game with Eleven on Top.<br /><br />Trenton bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum, has decided to make a career change. She decides that she needs something less dangerous and steadier. She is tired of being shot at, having her cars firebombed and her apartment broken into.  Her search for a replacement job isn't very successful, and she has very short stints at the button factory, Cluck-in-a-Bucket and Kan Klean Dry Cleaners.  But her life isn't in any way less dangerous as someone starts leaving her threatening notes and bombs her car.  So Plum becomes a bit of a PI as she tries to track down this stalker.  She also ends up working for Ranger doing computer searches for his company, Rangeman.  At the same time, Morelli and Ranger are investigating the sudden disappearance of four Trenton men.  Of course, everything is tied together.<br /><br />Eleven on Top has quite a few belly laughs, including a fight between Stephanie's Grandma Mazur and Morelli's Grandma Bella in Stiva's Funeral Home.  It's also quite funny when she swears off donuts and cake.  She instead channels her cravings for sweets into cravings of a more carnal sort.  There are also some comical scenes when Lula asks Stephanie to ride shotgun with her while apprehending FTA's (Lula takes on Stephanie's old bounty hunter position).<br /><br />Most of Stephanie's \\"regulars\\" are back including Morelli, Ranger, Lula, Grandma Mazur and Bob.  Some of the characters who I found becoming boring (Valerie, Albert Kloughn, etc.) only make cameo appearances.  Some Evanovich plots are a bit on the \\"lite\\" side, but Eleven on Top is one of her better ones.<br /><br />One complaint I have with many Evanovich books is that the endings are often rushed and there's no explanation of how things resolve.  Eleven is no exception.  But Evanovich always leaves things a bit opened ended.  Will Stephanie go back to her bounty hunter job?  Will she continue working for Rangeman?  Will she ever decide between Morelli and Ranger?  Will her life even be normal? Keep tuned for the answers to these questions in book number twelve!y Evanovich books is that the endings are often rushed and there's no explanation of how things resolve.  Eleven is no exception.

I fell in love with the writing of Geraldine Brooks when I read Year of Wonders, so I was anxious to tackle her new novel, March.  While I found the story beautifully written and richly moving, it won't appeal to everyone.<br /><br />Brooks takes the well known story of Little Women (Louisa May Alcott) and weaves a tale centering on the absentee father and husband, Peter March.  March starts out as a Yankee peddler, but the abolitionist movement eventually spurs him on to become a preacher. He marries Marmee, and they have four daughters.  Alcott's father, Bronson Alcott, provides the blueprint for the Reverend March, and his good friends are Concord neighbors Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau.  When the Civil War begins, March feels it his duty to enlist-even though he well past the age of the average soldier.<br /><br />March is a man of high ideals and unreachable dreams, but his many flaws keep him from always acting in a noble or heroic manner.  His efforts during the war are both heart warming and tragic.  Brooks gives us a glimpse of some little-known aspects of the war including the running of seized plantations by northern men and former slaves (contraband).  Sometimes conditions weren't much better than working under southern plantation owners.  We also get to see a bit of the abolitionist movement as well as the Underground Railroad.<br /><br />Brooks writes March in the first person (all but several chapters in Peter's voice).  You can read each sentence and feel the beauty of 19th Century written and spoken words.  But sometimes, this becomes plodding and the plot is slow to develop at the beginning.  I can imagine some readers giving up.  Also, while I thoroughly enjoyed March, I might have had an even greater appreciation if I had read Little Women.<br /><br />The Afterword provided a good chuckle.  Brooks' husband is Tony Horwitz of Confederates in the Attic.  She apparently loathed his extensive Civil War research.  But in the Afterward, she apologizes for refusing to get out the car at Antietam, for whining about the heat at Gettysburg, and for complaining about the shelf space needed to house his Civil War book collection.  To our benefit, it now appears that she has been bitten by this same obsessive bugterward, she apologizes for refusing to get out the car at Antietam, for whining about the heat at Gettysburg, and for complaining about the shelf space needed to house his Civil War book collection.

One of the distressing aspects of finding a terrific mystery series is when the author seems to have abandoned the effort.  Fall of a Cosmonaut is the 13th of 14 Stuart Kaminsky Porfiry Rostnikov mysteries, and he hasn't written a new one since 2001.  Having a mystery series set in Russia could be extremely depressing, but through the eyes of Porfiry Rosnikov, we see the eternal hopefulness that keeps Russians from the depths of despair.<br /><br />In 1986, a serious problem develops on the Mir space station.  While the problem is catastrophic, the cosmonauts land safely and a big hush campaign begins to keep this big secret.  But a year later, the cosmonauts on board (along with the three sent to relieve them) are being murdered systematically, or end up dead under mysterious circumstances.  Rostnikov and his son, Iosef, are assigned to discover the location of one of the cosmonauts who seems to have simply vanished.  At the same time, Emil Karpo and Akardy Zelach are trying to find the person who murdered a scientist at the Center for the Study of Technical Parapsychology.  And Sasha Tkach and Elena Timofeyeva are after the person who has stolen an unreleased film to be shown at the Cannes Film Festival on the life of Tolstoy.<br /><br />Kaminsky is always first rate in his plot development, but this book is even more enjoyable than his previous efforts.  Some of the most comical moments involve \\"the vampire,\\" Emil Karpo.  The stern Karpo does not believe in emotion, imagination or the paranormal.  Yet while investigating the murder of the institute's director, this skeptic is exposed to more than a few examples of visions, telepathy and clairvoyance.  Even the slow-witted Zelach seems to have paranormal gifts, and those at the institute are anxious to study him.<br /><br />Fall of a Cosmonaut is the 7th book I have read in this series, and knowing that I'm now halfway done, maybe I'll try to stretch them out just a little more.  It would be a shame to go through them quickly and then not be able to look forward.o go through them quickly and then not be able to look forward.   <br />	2005-06-24

Stuart Kaminsky's Blood and Rubles is the 10th book in his Porfiry Rostnikov series, and I enjoy each book even better than the last.<br /><br />After the communist government has fallen, Russia finds herself in a state of unrest.  As a result, crime is rampant and Moscow Special Crimes Investigator Rostnikov and his associates have more than enough to keep them busy.  Rostnikov is probing the kidnapping of a wealthy businessman.  Emil Karpo is searching for the Mafioso whose crossfire killed his innocent girlfriend.  Elena Timofeyeva is investigating the theft of tsarist treasures.  And Sasha Tkach and Akardy Zelach are trying to nab three youngsters who are suspected of beating, robbing and then killing men who are walking the streets drunk.  Most of the crimes are a direct result of the economic hardships within Russian.  Nobody has enough money, people can't feed their children and living conditions are grim.  Even the police are not immune to this domestic downturn.<br /><br />Once again, Rostnikov is amazing in his grasp of the situation and his intuition.  But even when cases are solved, the Russian justice system is not a well-oiled machine, and Justine is not always done.<br /><br />One of the most entertaining aspects of Blood and Rubles is the black FBI agent, Craig Hamilton, who is assigned to shadow Rostnikov.  The FBI and the Russian police have very different ideas on crime solving.  Russians are also amazed to see a black American who speaks perfect Russian.  Rostnikov and Hamilton working together provide for some comical moments.<br /><br />Kaminsky may be an American author, but he writes convincingly of the Russian condition, including the angst and irony that are a part of everyday life.  He definitely has become one of my favorite mystery writers.  I only wish that I could read these books in order, as their personal lives progress with each book.  Unfortunately, some are out of print and hard to get.	2005-06-20

Carol O'Connell's Killing Critics is her third Kathleen Mallory mystery, and they just continue to get better.  This book has it all: complex plot, memorable characters and some brilliant detective work.<br /><br />An artist, Dean Starr, is discovered murdered in the middle of an art gallery exhibition.  His death is made to look like performance art.  NYPD Special Crimes Unit detectives Mallory and Ricker are called in to investigate.  Twelve years previous, there was a brutal double homicide in an art gallery owned by the same man, and the circumstances are very similar.  Mallory's late father, Markowitz, was on that case and although he got a confession and a conviction, he never for a minute believed that he had the right man.  As Mallory and Riker find out more about this new murder, the more parallels there are to the old one.  Yet, the NYPD considers the old case closed, and will not allow them to \\"officially\\" investigate.  The list of suspects is very long, and there are also a good number of people who would like to see the murders remain unsolved.  Those in high ranking office are vulnerable including the police commission and a state senator.<br /><br />In Killing Critics, O'Connell gives us a crash course on the New York City art world, including artists, works of art, galleries, gallery owners, art shows, art critics, art patrons and art investors.  It truly is fascinating.  She also opens the door wider into Mallory's troubled childhood, and we better understand why she remains so scarred.  All the major characters (Mallory, Riker and Butler) are fleshed out in greater detail.<br /><br />Two things kept me from giving this book five stars.  First, I thought it was a bit slow at the beginning, although it quickly picked up speed and the ending will blow you away.  Second, I thought it stretched O'Connell's credibility to have Mallory challenge a former Olympic gold medalist to a fencing duel (she only had one semester of fencing in college).  Still, these criticisms aside, this is an awesome story and O'Connell is one of the few writers who gives us mysteries with meat.ill, these criticisms aside, this is an awesome story and O'Connell is one of the few writers who gives us mysteries with meat.   <br />	2005-06-15

I have read about a half dozen Porfiry Rostnikov mysteries by Stuart Kaminsky, and I think A Cold Red Sunrise was the most enjoyable so far.<br /><br />A young daughter of a dissident living in Siberia dies under mysterious circumstances, and an investigator from Moscow is sent to Tumsk.  When he is brutally murdered, Porfiry Rostnikov (a detective in Moscow's Bureau of Special Projects) is dispatched to this same Siberian town.  Rostnikov takes with him his trusty associate, Emil Karpo.  Rostnikov is expendable and has already been demoted from the procurator's office. He has both procurator spies and the KGB watching him, hoping that he'll do something inappropriate.  At the same time, fellow associate Sasha Tkach is back in Moscow, investigating robberies, black market offenses and attacks on tourists.<br /><br />What made A Cold Red Sunrise so enjoyable is the mini-lesson Kaminsky provides on Siberia.  Covering over 5  million square miles, Siberia is short on daylight, summers and warm weather, but rich in beauty and natural resources.  Nicknamed The Sleeping Giant, it has long provided a landing place for Russian dissidents, prisoners and misfits.  There are not a lot of residents living in Tumsk, but almost everyone is a suspect.  How Rostnikov breaks the case is ingenious.<br /><br />My only suggestion in reading this series is to read them in order.  Since the personal lives of the regulars progress with each book, it will make them more meaningful.  I only regret that I am reading these books much faster than Kaminsky is writing them.  In fact, he hasn't had a new Rostnikov in a number of years.	2005-06-08

David Guterson has given us an amazing book in Snow Falling on Cedars.  It is hard to categorize this novel as it's part murder mystery, part courtroom drama, part war chronicle and part romance.<br /><br />The story begins in 1954 as a Japanese-American fisherman is on trial for murder.  Kabuo Miyamoto is the chief suspect in the killing of fellow fisherman Carl Heine, because of a dispute over farm land.  The entire book takes place on fictional San Piedro Island in Puget Sound.  The inhabitants of this small island tend to be either gill-net fishermen or strawberry farmers.  There are a number of Japanese on San Piedro, and there's an uneasy coexistence with the locals.<br /><br />In flashbacks, Guterson takes us to life on the island prior to World War II.  Living on the island could be hard, but rewarding.  But things changed rapidly with the bombing of Pearl Harbor.  Many Japanese men were sent to work camps.  Soon after, the rest of them were relocated to internment camps.  Many of the local boys (Japanese included) enlisted, and the author gives us glimpses of their war experiences. Those who returned home bore the scars of war, and these things set the stage for the murder trial.<br /><br />This novel is so moving on so many levels.  I was moved by the love story between Hatsue and Ishmael, two innocent teens who were kept apart by the prejudice of their parents generation.  Guterson's love scenes were few, but tender.  I was mortified by the ugly chapter in our nations past when American's of Japanese decent were herded into internment camps.  Their treatment was deplorable.  I was saddened by the continued prejudice toward the Japanese--even well after the war.  My heart was also warmed by the heroic deeds performed by unlikely heroes.  I was also awed by the beautiful prose that often bordered on poetry.  In describing how a wife tried to help her husband recover from the war, Guterson writes \\"She sat across from him at the kitchen table at three o'clock in the morning, while he stared in silence or talked or wept, and she took when she could a piece of his sorrow and stored it for him in her own heart.\\"  It doesn't get much better than this.<br /><br />This year isn't quite halfway over, but I already predict that Snow Falling on Cedars will be one of the best books I read this year.'clock in the morning, while he stared in silence or talked or wept, and she took when she could a piece of his sorrow and stored it for him in her own heart.\\"  It doesn't get much better than this. <br /> <br />This year isn't quite halfway over, but I already predict that Snow Falling on Cedars will be one of the best books I read this year.	2005-06-08

Holidays on Ice: Stories was my first exposure to David Sedaris, and this collection of 6 holiday essays is the funniest book, ever.  With Sedaris, nothing is sacred about the holidays.  He lampoons working at Macy's as a Christmas elf, holiday newsletters, school pageants, and excessive gift giving.  Some of his humor is side-splitting, tears rolling down your cheeks funny.  SantaLand Dairies, about Sedaris working at Macy's in SantaLand is the funniest and the longest story of the bunch.  How Sedaris kept himself sane while parading around as an elf will have you laughing out loud.<br /><br />Other stories are written with a deeper, darker, more satirical wit.  One story, Seasons Greetings to Our Friends and Family, was a little too morbid for my taste.  But all the stories are good, and all of them make us realize how over-the-top our Christmas celebrations have become.<br /><br />I listened to this book on CD, which made it even more enjoyable as it's read by the author.  Simply reading the book will cheat you out of hearing Sedaris mimic Billie Holiday singing Away In A Manger.<br /><br />So in addition to the three or four other Christmas \\"classics\\" that I enjoy reading each year, I now have a new one to add to my list.	2005-06-07

If you are a Nicholas and Alexandra fan and can only have one book in your collection, Tsar: The Lost World of Nicholas and Alexandra by Peter Kurth is that book.  There is not a book around that is so stunningly beautiful, or that brings the world of Nicholas and Alexandra to life as this one does.<br /><br />Unlike many coffee-table books, Tsar gives a comprehensive history of the story of Nicholas and Alexandra from their childhoods to their captivity and death.  It also details the discovery of their remains, although it was published just prior to their state burial in 1998.  The one negative about the text is that Kurth displays a thinly veiled endorsement of Anna Anderson actually being Anastasia. I don't care how similar they may have looked-show me the DNA.<br /><br />But the true story is told through the unbelievable pictures and paintings of both the past and present.  It is in these that Tsar: The Lost World truly excels.  These photographs not only show the beauty of their lives, but also are haunting in that they reveal the true tragedy of the last tsar and his family.  Many before and after pictures are used to show the amazing contrast.  They include The Winter Palace today, and when it was used as a World War I hospital.  Or the tranquil photo of the Palace Square during a snowfall today vs. the Bloody Sunday Massacre scene.  Especially tragic are the pictures of the imperial children along with modern day photos of their toys and playthings.  They truly were innocent victims in this saga.  The pictures of the royal residences are larger than life (many in color) and are alone worth the price of this book.  They include The Alexander Palace, The Catherine Palace, The Winter Palace, Peterhof, Livadia and Gatchina.  It's eerie to see these places today, now so quiet, tranquil and vacant.  A good number of the photos in Tsar are previously unpublished, and many are from palaces and rooms that are not open to the public.  Even a die-hard Romanov fan will find something new here.<br /><br />But for all the beauty of the Romanov's lifestyle, Kurth also shows the flip side including the dead Rasputin, the skeletan remains of the Romanovs, piles of World War I dead, trampled victims from Khodynka (the coronation celebration turned deadly), crumbling buildings, and photos showing the cellar in the Ipatiev House soon after Nicholas and family were brutally murdered there.  They're all very sobering, indeed.  Tsar also features an introduction by Edward Radzinsky, the noted author of The Last Tsar.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for a book that truly reflects the beauty and tragedy of Nicholas and Alexandra, Tsar: The Lost World is a must.  But do yourself a favor and stick with the hardback version.  It is a much more impressive book than the softbound version and one you will treasure for years.an will find something new here.    <br /> <br />But for all the beauty of the Romanov's lifestyle, Kurth also shows the flip side including the dead Rasputin, the skeletan remains of the Romanovs, piles of World War I dead, trampled victims from Khodynka (the coronation celebration turned deadly), crumbling buildings, and photos showing the cellar in the Ipatiev House soon after Nicholas and family were brutally murdered there.

Carol O'Connell's The Man Who Cast Two Shadows is the second Kathleen Mallory mystery, and it's even better than the first.<br /><br />Mallory is a detective in New York City's Special Crimes Unit. Her colleagues all fear she has been killed when a body is found in a park, similar in appearance and wearing a blazer embroidered with her name.  Mallory quickly identifies the victim (whose fingers have been destroyed to hamper a positive ID) and she is given the case.  The detectives only have three clues to work with including an unpublished manuscript, a missing computer file and a cat who knows the murderer.  The clues point to three possible suspects who all live in the same building. Mallory starts baiting them with computer messages in an effort to flush out the killer.  Unfortunately, Mallory herself becomes bait.<br /><br />The Man Who Cast Two Shadows is interesting in that it provides more background into the lives of those characters introduced in book one including Mallory, Riker, Coffey and Charles Butler.  The reader gets a better understanding of their motives and their actions.  These characters all have major flaws, yet they bring a brilliance to the job of solving crimes and seeing that justice is done.  Mallory always seems to be one step ahead of everyone-maybe because she has the ability to think like a criminal.<br /><br />Unfortunately, as in book one, The Man Who Cast Two Shadows contains a strong subplot of magic, and I'm beginning to tire of this angle. It's not always believable.  Also, I prefer books with shorter chapters, and this 278 page book only has seven.  But despite the magic and the long chapters, O'Connell is a thoughtful writer and I'm definitely a fan.	2005-06-01

As a die-hard Romanov fan, I found the story of Empress Marie Feodorovna in Little Mother of Russia by Coryne Hall to be fascinating.  Unfortunately, errors and oversights by Hall kept this from being a truly great biography.<br /><br />Marie, the former Princess Dagmar of Denmark, is best known as the mother of the ill-fated Tsar Nicholas II.  This is a rags to riches to almost rags story.  Dagmar was born into one of the poorer branches of the Danish Royal Family.  Although not heir to the throne, circumstances lead to her father being crowned King Christian IX.  Her sister Alix eventually became Queen Alexandra of England (married to Edward VII), and her brother became King George I of Greece.  Dagmar was not as beautiful as Alix, but she had velvety eyes, a caring heart, a petite figure and a sense of style.  She was originally engaged to the Russian Tsarevitch Nicholas.  When Nicholas died suddenly, his brother Alexander (Sasha) took Dagmar as his bride.  This was a marriage of opposites, yet it was one of the happiest among any royal family at that time. When Sasha ascended the throne on the assassination of his father, Alexander II, Dagmar became the glittering and very popular Empress Marie Feodorovna.<br /><br />Sasha and Marie had a happy family life and reared five children.  But their biggest failing was raising Tsarevitch Nicholas to be a weak man, totally unprepared for the crown.  When Sasha died suddenly at the age of 49, Marie's life took a dramatic turn when she found herself on the outside looking in.<br /><br />Nicholas was totally dominated by his wife, Alexandra.  The situation became worse when after the birth of four daughters, the empress finally gave birth to a son and heir, Alexis.  Soon after his birth, it was discovered that Alexis suffered from hemophilia.  In desperation, Nicholas and Alexandra turned to a number of quacks and mystics before meeting up with the infamous Rasputin.  Marie could only sit by helplessly as Russia headed toward revolution.<br /><br />Little Mother Russia shows how Marie was a woman of contradictions.  She was a loving and devoted mother to her oldest three children.  But after she became empress, she became more remote and detached to the two youngest.  She was an anti-Semite, yet treated Jews with kindness.  She wasn't the most intelligent woman, but she was clever, witty and possessed a strong political acumen.  Marie had a talent for toning down her often stubborn and autocratic husband.  It wasn't until after Sasha's death that she became stubborn herself, as well as selfish and demanding.<br /><br />After the revolution, Marie lost almost everything including two sons, five grandchildren, assorted in-laws, her palaces, her wealth and most of her possessions.  She lived the rest of her life in her native Denmark, supported by her two nephews, King George V (England) and King Christian X (Denmark).  Her meager allowances did not allow her to live as an empress, although she certainly tried.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there are a number of problems that detract from this book.  First, there are a number of typos and errors that are unacceptable.  Little Mother of Russia is generously sprinkled with Russian terms without explanations.  I had to go on Google to discover that a panikhida is a memorial service.  The ending was rushed and not well documented.  On page 357, she states that the remains of two bodies, believed to be Alexis and the missing grand duchess, were discovered near Ekaterinburg and were awaiting DNA testing.  She does not document where she got this information, and I have not seen this mentioned anywhere else.<br /><br />Even with these problems, Marie led a fascinating life and Little Mother of Russia is quite interesting.  Just the photos are worth the price of the book-many never before seen.  So while I thought this book was good, it could have been much better.headed toward revolution. <br /> <br />Little Mother Russia shows how Marie was a woman of contradictions.

The Best American Mystery Stories of 2001 is a compilation of 20 short mysteries and is edited by Lawrence Block.  These stories are a mixed bag by such writers a Joyce Carol Oates, Russell Banks, William Gay, Clark Howard and a host of other writers-the majority of them who are pretty much unknown.  The stories are not your typical mysteries and I was a little disappointed in this respect.  I missed the point entirely of The Face Lift by Roxana Robinson, and I'm not sure why it was even included with this group.  Some I liked more than others including Lobster Night (Russell Banks), Blood Sport (Thomas Lynch), Missing in Action (Peter Robinson) and The Book of Kells (Jeremiah Healy).<br /><br />What I really enjoyed about The Best American Mystery Stories was the introduction by Lawrence Block.  Block recounts the history of short story writing in America.  At one time, there were many venues for short stories, and short story writers were very well paid.  The short story also allowed many writers to sharpen their skills before tackling a lengthier and more ambitious novel.  I listened to this book on CD, and I especially liked those stories read by Block.  He lacks a smooth, newscaster-type voice, but his gravelly tone was perfect for these mysteries.<br /><br />With any collection of stories, some are bound to be stronger than others.

A friend of mine highly recommended the Kathleen Mallory mystery series by Carol O'Connell, and I started with book number one-Mallory's Oracle.  While this book had enough rough spots to keep it from being great, it definitely has great potential as a series.<br /><br />New York City police detective Louis Markowitz picks up a 10 year old homeless street urchin for stealing. Instead of arresting her, he takes Kathleen Mallory home and raises her as his own.  Mallory (as she likes to be called) stills deals with issues from her childhood (unemotional, hardnosed, a loner, etc.), but she has an undying love for her adopted parents.  She follows Louis to the police academy and ends up in the special crimes unit, specializing in computer research.<br /><br />Louis begins investigating the brutal murders of several older, wealthy women from Grammercy Park.  Working alone and hot on the trail of this serial killer, he is murdered alongside another victim.  Mallory takes it upon herself to take on this investigation (without police sanction, of course) and tries to piece together all the bits of information Louis had gathered.  Louis trained Mallory well, but there is still the possibility that following his trail will cause Mallory to make the same mistakes he did, and lead to her becoming another victim.<br /><br />Along the line, Mallory uncovers a complicated plot that deals with magic, s&eacute;ances, and insider trading.  There is also a whole list of colorful characters who are all suspects, and the identity of the killer came as a complete surprise.<br /><br />O'Connell writes with a keen intelligence, but I thought Mallory's Oracle became a bit disjointed at the end.  In an effort to speed up the action or to make things more suspenseful, I felt it started bouncing around too much and lost some continuity.  O'Connell also got sloppy with some of her facts.<br /><br />So while I enjoyed Mallory's Oracle and think the series has great potential, it's not quite there yet.e there yet. <br />	2005-05-17

Roosevelt 1944-1945 by Robert H. Ferrell isn't much of a book, and it doesn't cover much information not previously published.<br /><br />Most FDR fans know the basic facts about his life and death.  In 1944, his daughter, Anna Roosevelt Boettiger, insisted that her father have a complete physical because of what could be seen as a visible and marked physical decline.  Prior to that, the president's standing physician, Dr. Ross McIntire, was a Navy doctor whose specialty was Ear, Nose and Throat.  A battery of doctors from Bethesda Naval Hospital discovered that FDR suffered from severe hypertension and congestive heart failure.  In 1944, there was little the medical profession could do for these two maladies.  Unbelievably, the president was kept in the dark about his health, and he never asked questions about his health, constant medical testing, or his treatments.  These medical experts (who took over his treatment) were also not consulted about FDR's decision to run for a fourth term.<br /><br />There is not much new in The Dying President, except what comes from the diaries of FDR's distant cousin and confident, Margaret Daisy Suckley.  But even these revelations don't add much to the story, other than the fact that FDR did know that Dr. Howard Bruenn was a cardiologist.  Ferrell does offer the theories that FDR could have suffered from stomach cancer or melanoma.  But he provides no additional research to prove or disprove these already published speculations.<br /><br />When discussing a book written by Dr. Ross McIntire about FDR, Ferrell describes it as \\"absurdly thin.\\"  The same can be said about The Dying President.  The body of this book is only 152 pages, and 36 of these pages are photographs.  Ferrell also claims that FDR was such an ill man, that his omissions and mistakes changed the course of history.  History reveals otherwise.  Even his own cabinet member, Frances Perkins, was quoted as saying \\"He has a great and terrible job to do, and he's got to do it, even if it kills him.\\"<br /><br />I recommend you save your money and read The Hidden Campaign by Hugh Evans or FDR's Last Year by Jim Bishop for a better accounting of Roosevelt's last years.reat and terrible job to do, and he's got to do it, even if it kills him.\\"   <br /> <br />I recommend you save your money and read The Hidden Campaign by Hugh Evans or FDR's Last Year by Jim Bishop for a better accounting of Roosevelt's last years.   <br />	2005-05-14

Vanishing Act by Thomas Perry is the first book I've read in the Jane Whitefield series, and was a most pleasant surprise.  Instead of dealing with a cop, a PI or a bounty hunter, Jane Whitefield is a half-Indian (from the Seneca Tribe) who serves as a guide to help people \\"disappear.\\"  She uses her native skills to help those who are trying to flee from an abusive spouse or an unsavory past.<br /><br />In Vanishing Act, an ex-cop turned accountant, John Felker, is being framed by unknown persons and there is a contract out on his life.  He seeks out Jane, whom he has heard about by word of mouth.  But the men pursuing Felker are right on his tail, and Jane must work hard to give them the slip.  But just as Jane thinks everything is finally under control, two bombshells are dropped on her, and things are not as they seem.<br /><br />One thing that I really enjoyed about this book is the background on Native Americans that Vanishing Act provides.  Jane is from upstate NY, and there is much about the tribes from that area-especially before and during the Revolution.  Even when she travels to California, we are given information about the California Indian tribes.  In this respect, Perry is a lot like Tony Hillerman and his series of Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn mysteries.<br /><br />But while there is much to like about Vanishing Act, I thought the plot at times completely implausible.  It's hard to believe that when Jane finally identifies the murderer, she would chase him up into the Adirondack Mountains without notifying anyone of where she was going, calling the police, and even leaving a message with someone as to the identify of the killer.  It was just a bit beyond belief.<br /><br />Still, I thoroughly enjoyed Vanishing Act, and am planning to read Shadow Woman next.	2005-05-14

I always thought that no author could rival Martin Cruz Smith when it came to writing Russian mysteries.  But Stuart Kaminsky's Porfiry Rostnikov series certainly comes close.  I just finished The Dog Who Bit a Policeman, and so far, it's the best of the bunch that I've read thus far.<br /><br />As post-Soviet Russia moves into a state of greater lawlessness, groups of Russian Mafia are vying for control.  Things are getting out of hand and more and more people (innocent and otherwise) are being killed.  Chief Inspector Rostnikov and his assistant, Emil Karpo, are trying to keep the conflict between two rival groups from escalating to an all out war.  Another group of Mafia is running regular dog fights, and Sasha Tkach and Elena Timofeyeva go undercover in a very dangerous operation to infiltrate this brutal and deadly enterprise.  Meanwhile, Rostnikov's son, Iosef (who is now a policeman) is working to find a Moscow government official who has gone missing.  In between, the central characters must also deal with a host of other issues.  Rostnikov's wife, Sara, has apparently had a relapse of a brain tumor and needs further surgery.  Iosef and Elena have started dating, and Iosef wants Elena to marry him.  Sasha's wife, Maya, is fed up with the brooding Sasha and is threatening to leave.  Corruption is still very much evident, even among police officials.  And there is not enough money, goods or food for most of the Russian population.<br /><br />I listened to this book on tape (unabridged) on a long trip, and it was suspenseful enough to keep me on the edge of my seat for approximately 11 hours. My only minor complaint was that hearing it on tape, it was difficult to keep the characters straight at the beginning.  My only other recommendation would be to read the Rostnikov series in order.  Since the personal lives of the characters continue to evolve with each book, it would make for better continuity.  Still, a Kaminsky book, in any order, is better than most mysteries out there today.ost mysteries out there today. <br />	2005-05-11

I don't know how The Partner by John Grisham has escaped me for so long as this is one of his earlier books.  It has the action packed, conspiracy laden plot that we have come to expect from him.  I read this 480 page book in less than 24 hours.  While it was entertaining and suspenseful, I knew it was impossible for one character to have everything figured out.<br /><br />Patrick Lanigan is a partner in a law firm in Biloxi Mississippi when he is killed in a fiery car crash.  He is burned beyond recognition, and his remains are cremated and then buried.  But when several weeks later, 90 million dollars goes missing from his law firm, Patrick becomes the chief suspect.  Four and a half years later, Patrick is discovered living in Brazil, and is captured and tortured by some disreputable characters who are working on behalf of the companies that were bilked of their millions, including two insurance companies.  Patrick does have the money, although he doesn't know the exact location of it.  But he also knows a terribly powerful secret that can bring many people crashing down if the information was to be made public.  The Partner becomes a literary game of chess as Patrick uses this information while bargaining with the FBI, the Justice Department and Harrison County Law Enforcement.<br /><br />But while The Partner is entertaining, it is totally unbelievable.  First, Lanihan has managed the almost perfect crime, and there are just too many coincidences to be realistic.  He becomes an expert at disappearing, becomes proficient in a new language, masters electronic surveillance, tackles offshore banking, learns to hide money, creates gasoline bombs, and a host of other skills.  I'm not sure that Lanigan was even likable, and when the book ended with a shocker, I wasn't sure if I was glad or sad for Patrick.  In fact, there weren't a whole lot of likable characters in The Partner, except for maybe Sandy McDermott, who was Lanigan's college friend and served as his lawyer.<br /><br />So if you're looking for something with lots of action and some twists and turns, The Partner is vintage Grisham.  But don't expect it to be believable.  It's more a light, summer beach book than a work of great literature.lawyer.    <br /> <br />So if you're looking for something with lots of action and some twists and turns, The Partner is vintage Grisham.

In John Grisham's The Last Juror, he gives us a break from his usual fast paced, conspiracy laden legal thrillers.  Instead, he offers an old fashioned, Southern-style tale best told on a lazy hot day sitting on a veranda with a tall glass of sweet tea.<br /><br />The main character is Willie Traynor.  Willie shows up in small town Clanton Mississippi to work for a dying family-owned weekly newspaper.  Willie isn't particularly ambitious, and his rich grandmother has pulled the plug on his college education after 5 years at Syracuse with no degree. Through a series of unforeseen events, Willie ends up purchasing the newspaper and turning it around.  Southerners are slow to accept outsiders, but Willie ends up being a \\"character,\\" which charms most of his fellow neighbors.  He starts dressing in seersucker suits and bow ties, purchases and restores an older home, visits every church in the county (but refuses to join any of them) and befriends people on both sides of the color line (this is back in the early 1970's when things were still very segregated).  He quickly befriends Callie Ruffin, a self-educated black woman who speaks perfect English.  They meet when Willie wants to write a human interest story about her remarkable family (seven of her eight children are college professors with doctorates).  Miss Ruffin also serves as friend, mentor and mother-figure to young Will.<br /><br />Things in quiet Clanton change dramatically when a woman is brutally murdered. She knows her killer, and gives his name to a neighbor before she dies.  The killer's family has political clout, and a guilty verdict isn't always a foregone conclusion.  The defendant also threatens the jury that he will get them if he is convicted. Miss Callie is the first black woman to be picked for a jury in Clanton, and actually holds the position of The Last Juror.<br /><br />Grisham has used Clanton for two previous books, and some of the characters make repeat appearances.  The best of the bunch is lawyer Harry Rex.  But Grisham does a fine job fleshing out the characters for this book, the likes of which could only be found in a Southern town.  The plot isn't as action-packed as his previous books, but he still manages to deal with important issues including integration, changes to penal codes, local politics and political corruption.<br /><br />My only complaint about The Last Juror is that I saw the end coming a mile away (and I don't usually figure out the villain in a mystery).  Otherwise, I thought The Last Juror was a fine book and a fun read.  After some weaker efforts, Grisham has managed to come through with a fairly big hit.the bunch is lawyer Harry Rex.

(Buzz) Bissinger, was a regular for the Philadelphia Inquirer for a number of years.  He even won a Pulitzer for his series on the Philadelphia court system.  So when he took a leave of absence from the paper in 1988 and moved his wife and family down to Odessa to write about Texas football in Friday Night Lights, it was only natural that he would come up with a huge blockbuster.<br /><br />Odessa is situated in the Oil Belt of West Texas.  The fortunes of Odessa took a dive when the oil boom headed south, and it is constantly ranked as one of the worst places to live in the entire nation.  But there is one area where Odessa excels year after year, and that is the football program at Permian High School.  It has not just the most successful program in all of Texas, but also the United States as well.  Bissinger got permission to follow the team for an entire season, starting with pre-season practice in August.  He attended practices, met with players, interviewed coaches and fans, and also met with a few football critics.  He attended games-always on a Friday night with a stadium packed with 20,000 screaming fans.<br /><br />Along the way, he learned much about football, the oil business, Odessa, and politics.  Some of what he saw was good.  The pride in the Permian Panthers gave the entire town something to rally around.  The Panthers were not always the most physically talented team, but Permian coaches always got the most from their well-prepared and well-conditioned athletes.  But Bissinger also saw many negatives surrounding football mania.  Football took a backseat to academics at Permian, and more money was spent for athletic tape for one year than for English supplies.  Football players were treated like gods, and authority figures looked the other way when they misbehaved.  Players were expected to play injured-at the expense of being called a slacker or losing a coveted starting spot.  Racism was always an underlying theme in Odessa, which seemed a contradiction considering the strong religious values Odessians claimed to hold dear.  The girls at PHS were relegated to support roles, and heaven help the girl who appeared too intelligent.  And the fans tended to be rabid.  When Coach Gaines lost for the second time in the 1988 season, he came home to discover almost a dozen \\"For Sale\\" signs on his front lawn.  These signs would also make appearances on the lawns of players who happened to have a bad game.<br /><br />When Friday Night Lights was first published, the people of Odessa felt outraged and betrayed.  A book signing in Odessa had to be cancelled because of more than a few death threats.  But at least the book forced a few Odessians to look at themselves in the mirror, and they didn't like what they saw.  The book I read has a 10 Year Afterward, and Bissinger tells of some of the major changes brought about by Friday Night Lights.  Academic programs were beefed up and test scores are on the rise.  More money and efforts are being directed toward women (both athletically and academically).  Fans have toned down a bit, although football still holds center stage.  And he gives a synopsis of the six players he highlighted in the book.  Almost all discovered that there was little that could top playing Friday night football in front of 20,000 fans.<br /><br />Friday Night Lights is not just a sports story, and Bissinger shows that he is equally talented whether writing about Texas football or the city of Philadelphia.

If someone had told me that Simon Winchester's The Meaning of Everything:  The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary was a riveting read, I wouldn't have believed them.  But after listening to just one CD (unabridged), I was sold!  I challenge a fiction writer to compose a novel so compelling.<br /><br />The history of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) actually has its roots in the history of the English language and the British Isles.  As various countries invaded and occupied England, a large number of foreign languages contributed to the jambalaya that has become English.  Unbelievably, the first English dictionary wasn't written until the early 1600's.  Dr. Johnson wrote the first widely used dictionary in the mid-1750's, and it was approximately 100 years later that work began on the OED.  The Philological Society of London determined that there was a great need for a newer, more comprehensive book.<br /><br />In 1861, The Philological Society set a goal to create this new reference book, and set up guidelines for its creation.  The original time frame was 10 years, but when five years later they were only up to \\"ant,\\" the society realized that this was a much more difficult job than anticipated.  In all, it took 68 years and 3 weeks to see this lofty work completed.<br /><br />This task is even more amazing in that this was before computers, and everything had to be handwritten.  The society had to decide what words were to be included, the proper pronunciations, a variety of meanings, their root words, etc.  The vocabulary was to include all English words from 1150 on, plus early words still in common usage.  It is no wonder that the OED ended up being 10 volumes, rather than the two originally planned.<br /><br />At times during the 68 plus years, it appeared that the OED project was close to death.  But someone always appeared on the scene at crucial times to ensure its continued progress.  Probably the biggest contributor was Dr. James Murray, a self-educated son of a Scottish tailor.  As senior editor for many years, he resurrected the project from near extinction and gave the OED its format.  Unfortunately, he didn't live to see the OED completed, although after 35 years as senior editor, it was nearing completion.<br /><br />There were many interesting and colorful characters who worked behind the scenes with Murray, and Winchester covers them with awe and delight.  It is almost a miracle that so many individuals with so many idiosyncrasies could create such a perfect work.<br /><br />After finishing The Meaning of Everything, I was tempted to pick it up and start all over again.  In any case, I'll definitely read Winchester's related tome, The Professor and The Madman: A Tale of Murder, Insanity, and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary.a self-educated son of a Scottish tailor.

After Polar Star, Renko finds himself back in Moscow and restored to his former position as an investigator.  The Soviet Union is on the brink of collapse, and five or six different groups of Russian Mafia are vying for control in Moscow.  One man, Rudy Rosen, is a tie to these many groups as he serves as a \\"banker\\" to them all.  He also is an informer for Renko.  When Rosen is brutally murdered, Renko has the difficult job of trying to find the killer.<br /><br />Renko's search takes him from Moscow to Germany, where the possible suspects include gang members, the KGB, a Russian businessman and even a Russian prosecutor.  There are many shady situations in Russia as communism begins its freefall, and the waters are definitely clouded.  But Renko is extremely intelligent and also, very observant.  Through hard work and perseverance, the waters start to clear for him.<br /><br />Reading about this period of Russian history is always fascinating.  It is also interesting to read how Radio Liberty (sponsored by Americans) broadcast out of Germany.  This was the only way Russians could discover what was really happening in the USSR.<br /><br />My only complaint about Red Square is that it seemed rather disjointed for the first one hundred pages or so.  It was often difficult to keep characters straight and to follow the plot.  But things really picked up halfway through, and the remainder of the book was riveting.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />So while I think Red Square fell just a little short of Gorky Park and Polar Star, it is still a fine effort by Cruz Smith.	2005-05-01

I enjoyed Cassandra King's novel, The Sunday Wife, and was anxious to start her new effort, The Same Sweet Girls.  I am sorry to say that I did not enjoy this book as much as I anticipated.<br /><br />The Same Sweet Girls is a group of six women who forged a friendship during their undergraduate years at a religious women's college in Alabama.  It is now 30 years after graduation, and they continue to meet several times a year for friendship, catching up and to crown a new queen.  Of course, they all have \\"issues.\\"  Several new crises present themselves in The Same Sweet Girls, including the serious illness of one of them, the unhappy marriage of another, separation, divorce, estrangement from children and dealing with an abusive but ever present ex-husband.  Unfortunately, this \\"girls group\\" theme has been already done by Patricia Gaffney in The Saving Graces and Anne Rivers Siddons in The Outerbanks.  So there's no novelty here.<br /><br />While The Same Sweet Girls consists of six women, King alternates chapters in the first person of only three of them.  I am always floored when authors write chapters in this style, and convince you that you are listening to different people.  King fails in this effort, and all three women are written in the same voice.<br /><br />Still, The Same Sweet Girls has some redeeming qualities.  The six women are all Southern Belles, and this book is filled with Southern witticisms and good common sense.  These girls aren't really girls and they're not very sweet, but they're often very funny.  It's a fairly fast read, and I was anxious to find out what happens at the end.<br /><br />So while I can't say that I didn't enjoy The Same Sweet Girls, I just was expecting a little more from Cassandra King.	2005-04-20

Polar Star by Martin Cruz Smith is the second in his Arkady Renko series, and the sequel to his bestselling book, Gorky Park.  Things ended badly for Moscow investigator Renko in Gorky Park.  He's been fired from his job and removed from the party.  Polar Star opens with Renko relegated to as close to a modern day Siberian work camp as you can get-a fishing factory ship called the Polar Star in the Bering Sea.  Renko has spent a good part of a year stuck on the \\"slime line,\\" where he guts and cleans fish.<br /><br />Events change quickly for Renko when a young, flirtatious cafeteria worker is scooped up in a fishing net, murdered.  Renko is called on by the ship's captain to help assist as Renko is the only person on board with a background in investigation.  At first, the officer running the investigation tries to convince everyone it was an accident.  But Renko knows better, and finally convinces enough people that he is allowed to investigate independently.<br /><br />The Polar Star is working on a joint fishing expedition alongside American ships, and the possible suspects include not just Russians, but also, Americans.  But as more crew members turn up dead, Renko's job becomes more perilous and his life is in danger.  There aren't too many good places to hide on a fishing boat.  The last chapters will have you on the edge of your seat!<br /><br />I am amazed that Cruz Smith can write about Russian characters in a way that penetrates their psyche in such a convincing manner (especially considering he isn't Russian).  Polar Star is also fascinating in that it takes place during the tail end of the Soviet Era, and we get a glimpse of how Russian's struggled to \\"see things in a new way.\\"  Usually, this \\"new way\\" was contrary to communist doctrine.  Also, not much is known about these joint US-Soviet fishing expeditions.  Americans and Russians certainly make for strange bedfellows. The KGB and CIA are always lurking in the background as they each try to spy on the other.  Polar Star is also interesting in that it fills in the gaps since Gorky Park.  Renko had many unresolved issues at the end of book one.<br /><br />Only one thing would have improved this almost perfect book-a map of the Bering Sea and the surrounding lands.  This is not exactly an area well known to most of us.  Otherwise, I think that Cruz Smith is one of our finest mystery writers today, and I already have Red Square waiting in the wings.y on the other.

But there are also other delicate problems such as what is best for the tribe, and what obligation does a white mother owe an adopted Native American child.  There are no easy answers.<br /><br />My one complaint about Pigs in Heaven is that there is a major coincidence that seems a bit unbelievable (I won't tell for fear of spoiling the story).  But I forgive Kingsolver this indiscretion for the beautiful prose to be found here, as well as the heart-warming ending. Most of Kingsolver's characters are short on book learning, but are keen observers of the world around them. Some of my favorites include:<br /><br />On parenting, \\"it's the one job where, the better you are, the more surely you won't be needed in the long run.\\"<br /><br />About women's friendships, \\"Sympathizing over the behavior of men is the baking soda of women's friendships, it seems, the thing that makes them bubble and rise.\\"<br /><br />Or while complaining about men who refuse to talk, \\"I think Roscoe used up his whole vocabulary when he asked me to marry him.  All that's left now is `Where's it at?' and `When's dinner?'\\"<br /><br />Even Kingsolver's chapter titles are priceless.  The two about Las Vegas are called \\"The Twilight Zone of Humanity\\" and \\"The Church of Risk and Hope.\\"<br /><br />I haven't read a Kingsolver yet that I didn't like, and have Prodigal Summer waiting in the wings.e Twilight Zone of Humanity\\" and \\"The Church of Risk and Hope.\\" <br /> <br />I haven't read a Kingsolver yet that I didn't like, and have Prodigal Summer waiting in the wings. <br />	2005-04-12

It hasn't taken me very long to become an avid fan of Stuart Kaminsky's Porfiry Rostnikov series of mysteries.  My latest read is Rostnikov's Vacation.<br /><br />The Soviet Government was big on sending workers on vacation.  As the book begins, the Soviet regime is hanging on for dear life in the midst of economic reforms.  Things appear very fishy when many high-ranking officials in the police and KGB are all ordered on vacation at the same time.  Yalta was a big vacation spot for senior officials, and Rostnikov and wife Sarah are spending their vacation there.  But there are not many left \\"minding the store\\" in Moscow.  A colleague of Rostnikov's (also on vacation in Yalta) turns up murdered, so Rostnikov's vacation becomes a working one.  He soon discovers that this colleague has uncovered a plot to kill Gorbachev and make it appear as it if was done by the CIA.<br /><br />There are also a number of interesting subplots.  Associates Emil Karpo and Sasha Tkach are involved in cases of their own.  Tkach has gone undercover in an effort to apprehend a group of criminals who are preying on Jewish computer technicians.  Karpo is on the trail of a drug-crazed Russian murderer and his American cohort.  Both cases are extremely dangerous, and pose a serious threat to the two detectives.  One aspect of the plot I didn't like is that it became a little confusing at times.  While the KGB is usually a lurking presence in Rostnikov's life, this time, at least one agent appears to be on Rostnikov's side.<br /><br />What I especially enjoyed about Rostnikov's Vacation are the descriptions of life in the Soviet Union during the fall of communism.  Historically, Russians have faced tremendous hardships.  This period in Russian history was especially unsettling for the people of Russia.  Money was scarce, food and goods were hard to find, and many people went months without receiving a paycheck.  Survival was difficult.  Yet, Russians have always learned to put a positive spin on life.<br /><br />Kaminsky is engaging enough that I am determined to read this entire series.

There aren't too many cities in the US with as many ghosts as Charleston, SC--except for maybe New Orleans or Savannah.  In Charleston Ghosts, Margaret Rhett Martin provides us with a look at 18 different ghosts known to haunt Charleston and the low country.  The spirit world is alive and well in Charleston, and there are ghosts of many happy and unhappy people who lived and died in the area.  Some of these are more well-known than others.<br /><br />Perhaps the most famous is Revolutionary War patriot, Isaac Hayne.  Most people think that Mel Gibson's character in the movie, The Patriot, is based on the life of Francis (Swamp Fox) Marion.  It was actually a compilation of Marion and Isaac Hayne.  After Hayne was hanged by the British, he began to make regular appearances in Charleston.  His voice and his footsteps could be heard for 100 years outside of Peronneau House.  While some people may have doubted his appearance as a ghost, the outrage over his death certainly stirred his countrymen to a stronger resistance and eventually, independence.  So in a sense, he definitely came back to haunt the British.<br /><br />The most infamous spirit belongs to Lavinia Fisher.  Fisher and her husband operated a boarding house outside Charleston called Six Mile House.  When a solo boarder showed up at their door, the pair would murder them while they slept, and then confiscate all their belongings.  When they were finally caught, Lavinia went to the gallows in her wedding gown.  Her ghost has been seen in a number of locations, including the Old Jailhouse.<br /><br />While short and light, Charleston Ghosts is not exactly a scholarly read.  I also noticed many discrepancies between the book and the many Charleston Ghost Tours that are prevalent in the Holy City.  Still, it's a fun book to pick-up and read before wandering the streets of Charleston.	2005-04-05

I have read a number of James Patterson novels, but 3rd Degree is the first book I've read in his Women's Murder Club series.<br /><br />Lindsay Boxer is a homicide detective who works for the San Francisco Police Department.  Boxer's world is blown to bits when she witnesses the explosion of a residence as she is jogging in San Francisco.  A backpack left at the scene claims responsibility in the name of a domestic terrorist group.  She calls on the skills of her three buddies (news writer Cindy, DA Jill, and medical examiner Claire) to help her solve the crime.  Deputy Director of Homeland Security, Joe Molinari, also becomes embroiled in this case.  But it quickly becomes more than one instance-as more people are murdered and the broad scope of the crimes increase<br /><br />There are few clues at the beginning, but Boxer, her Women's Murder Club friends, Molinari, a few errors by the terrorists and a terrorist turncoat allow them to start piecing together this complicated puzzle.  The situation is made even more complicated by the budding romance between Boxer and Molinari, along with the possibility that Boxer and her friends are not impervious to becoming victims themselves.<br /><br />3rd Degree is extremely fast moving with lots of plot and decent characters.  It also doesn't get bogged down with too much description (unlike some mystery writers today).  It kept me turning pages faster and faster, and reading late into the night.  But while it was a fast read, it was also a satisfying book.  I guess I'll have to go back and read books one and two in this series.	2005-04-05

There are few places in the U.S. with as many legends as the tribal lands of the West.  In Skeleton Man, Tony Hillerman weaves a fictional tale around a real occurrence-the collision of two commercial planes above the Grand Canyon in 1956.<br /><br />John Clarke is a diamond merchant with a cache of diamonds chained to his wrist.  One of these precious blue-white gems is intended for his fianc&eacute;e, who is pregnant with their child.  While flying home, his plane collides with another over the Grand Canyon, and bodies and debris rain down for miles.  Clarke's father refuses to acknowledge his son's fianc&eacute;e or child.  Years later, Clarke's daughter, Joanna Craig, sets out to prove her paternity and to claim the inheritance she has been denied.  The discovery of two diamonds brings her to the Grand Canyon in an effort to find her father's arm (which legend says was seen chained to the case of diamonds).  Her search is not so much for the diamonds, but for DNA.  But there are also those who have a lot to lose if Joanna is successful, and they set about trying to obstruct her investigation.<br /><br />Jim Chee, Bernie Manuelito, Cowboy Dashee and Joe Leaphorn are all pulled into the case in varying degrees.  They must wade through legends, traditions and 277 miles of Grand Canyon to solve this mystery.  Some Hillerman books are better, and some efforts worse-but I enjoy any effort that educates the reader on Native American traditions (which Skeleton Man does provide).  Also the information about the Grand Canyon is fascinating.  However, it's hokey to think that an arm bone can be found in the canyon decades after a crash.<br /><br />One of the subplots is the impending marriage between Officer Jim Chee and spunky Officer Bernie Manuelito.  Jim Chee has been engaged twice before, and as Manuelito starts to get cold feet, we wonder if the third time will really be a charm for Chee.<br /><br />Tony Hillerman continues to be one of my favorite mystery writers, and fans will enjoy Skeleton Man despite some flaws.ans will enjoy Skeleton Man despite some flaws. <br />	2005-03-29

I can think of no better author to listen to on a long car trip than David Baldacci.  On a recent trip, Hour Game made a long trip seem not long enough (we ran out of miles before we ran out of book).<br /><br />Ex-Secret Service Agents, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell (from Split Second), become embroiled in a series of murders when Michelle discovers the body of a prostitute while out for a jog.  The victim wears a watch set at 1:00, and it appears to be a copycat of the Zodiac serial killer.  Soon, more victims show up, and each is murdered in the style of a famous serial killer (Son of Sam, John Wayne Gacy, etc.) and each wears a watch set to a specific time (2:00, 3:00, etc.).<br /><br />At the same time they're investigating the murders, Michelle and Sean are also called on to investigate a robbery at the house of prominent aristocrats, Bobby and Remmy Battle.<br /><br />It soon becomes apparent to the former agents that there is a link between the murders and the robbery.  The Battles are a complex and dysfunctional family (think Tennessee Williams) and almost all of them have something to hide.  The more they dig, the murkier the waters become.<br /><br />The situation becomes even foggier when one of the principal characters is killed, and it's made to look like the serial killer has struck again.  Hour Game has so many twists and turns, that just when you think you have everything figured out, you'll discover that you are not even close!  When the killer was finally revealed, I had not a clue.  And the little \\"bonus\\" at the end was even more shocking, but also, unbelievable.<br /><br />There are quite a few characters, and they are murdered faster than the medical examiner can autopsy them (I think the number ends in double digits). Yet, Baldacci does a commendable job of helping the reader to keep them all straight.<br /><br />For my money, I can't think of an author who packs as much action, suspense, twists, turns and quirky characters into one book.  I have read all Baldacci's efforts to date, and I only hope that he'll be coming out with a new story before my next long trip.book.

Morality for Beautiful Girls is the third book in The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series by Alexander McCall Smith.  While this series is quite delightful, I found this book less entertaining and darker than the first two.<br /><br />The engagement plans of Precious Ramotswe and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni hit a snag when the groom-to-be comes down with a mysterious malady.  Mma Ramotswe not only has to run her detective agency, but also must oversee Mr. J.L B. Matekoni's garage, Tlokweng Rd. Speedy Motors.  This actually becomes more the story of Mma Makutsi, secretary and now assistant detective for the detective agency.  In addition to her detective agency duties, Makutsi is also made acting manager of the garage.  How she motivates the two, lazy, girl-crazy apprentices is a stitch.<br /><br />The agency deals with two cases in Morality for Beautiful Girls.  A government official suspects his brother is being poisoned by the brother's wife.  Mma Ramotswe must infiltrate the household as a guest to investigate the accusations.  Mma Makutsi digs into the backgrounds of four young ladies competing for the title of Miss Beauty and Integrity of Botswana.  Neither of these cases is as riveting as in the first two books.  Still, the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books are better than most \\"fluffy\\" mystery series out these days, and I will definitely pick up book number four, The Kalahari Typing School for Men.	2005-03-29

The first Porfiry Rostnikov mystery I read by Stuart Kaminsky was one of the last one of the series.  So I picked up A Fine Red Rain (his third) to gain some more background information.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />Rostnikov sets out to investigate the deaths of two thirds of a high wire circus act (one a suicide and the other an \\"accident\\").  Rostnikov does not believe in coincidence, and when he interviews the third person in the act, he discovers that her life is in danger as well.  The inspector finds that there is quite a bit of monkey business going on behind the scenes of the Moscow New Circus.<br /><br />At the same time, Rostnikov's associates, Emil Karpo and Sasha Tkach are investigating cases of their own.  Karpo is trying to track down a serial killer.  Tkach has come across a black market for western goods.  This subplot is quite fascinating, and gives us an interesting look at the extensive black market (along with accompanying police corruption) during the communist era.<br /><br />Kaminsky's Rostnikov series is excellent, and I only regret that he hasn't been more prolific in writing these particular books.  Fortunately for me, I have at least six or seven more to read.  I'm already working on Rostnikov's Vacation.	2005-03-29

The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series by Alexander McCall Smith is one of the most delightful and charming mystery series ever written.  In Tears of the Giraffe, McCall Smith begins where he left off with book number one, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.<br /><br />Precious Ramotswe is engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni , and it is amusing to see them wade through the minefield of a couple preparing for marriage.  The must choose a ring, decide how to combine households, and deal with a jealous and recalcitrant maid.  Two foster children appear on the scene to make things even more interesting.<br /><br />Mma Ramotswe is the only female detective in Botswana, and she opened her agency to make a living and provide assistance to her fellow Africans.  Precious is not necessarily well educated, but she has an abundance of common sense, logic and intuition.  She can sense where a long dead person is buried nearby, and can tell when a person is lying just by looking at them.  It is fun to watch the self-deprecating Precious match wits with a Duke-educated college professor-and win.  When Precious is stumped, she relies on her \\"bible,\\" The Principles of Private Detection by Clovis Andersen.  The cases she takes on are not much different from those of an American detective, including infidelity, missing persons, etc.  But sometimes, solving the moral dilemmas presented by these cases is more difficult than solving the cases themselves.<br /><br />Tears of the Giraffe is also a book about love.  There is not just the love between Precious and Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, but also their love for their fellow Africans and Botswana.  While written in modern times, it is fascinating to read about life in Botswana, and how Botswana differs from her African neighbors.<br /><br />The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency is not your typical mystery series, and Tears of the Giraffe is simply enchanting.  I have already started book number 3, Morality for Beautiful Girls.	2005-03-17

A friend recommended Stuart Kaminsky's Porfiry Rostnikov series, and after reading one book, I am smitten.  This series pushes all my buttons: a serious mystery, a Russian theme, great characters, and an exciting plot woven around current events.<br /><br />The book begins right after the fall of communism.  Lines are long, tempers are short, and Russian's are having a difficult time adjusting to the new regime.  Living conditions are Spartan and most people share an apartment with a friend or relative.  The Russian Orthodox Church is experiencing a resurgence.  The KGB is not what it once was, and many that were once at the top now find themselves on the bottom.  And the police, who were once feared and respected, are merely tolerated.<br /><br />Inspector Rostnikov and his staff are faced with two separate murders.  In the small village of Arkush, an outspoken priest is brutally murdered.  In Moscow, a young Jewish student is murdered, and his Syrian girlfriend (daughter of an important oil minister) has mysteriously disappeared.  Rostnikov and his partner, Karpo head for Arkush.  At the same time, their associates, Tkach and Timofeyeva investigate the Moscow murder.  Throughout their investigations, they are constantly tailed by the KGB, which can be comical at times.<br /><br />But where Kaminsky really shines is his characters.  All suffer pain and pathos, and all carry a heavy heart.  Rostnikov suffers from a severe leg injury obtained in World War II.  His beautiful wife, Sarah, is recuperating from a brain tumor.  Their son Iosef, a former soldier who fought in Afghanistan, has just written a play that disturbs his parents because of its angst.  Karpo, who was practiced communism with a religious zeal, now finds himself rudderless.  And so it goes.  But despite the hardships and pitfalls of living in Russia, they try to find some solace and comfort in simple things: a beautiful smile, a short line, a half a chicken, family, and friendship.<br /><br />My only regret with the Rostnikov series is that I started with book eight in the series, instead of book one.  But the good news is that I still have a good number of Rostnikov books to enjoy.  I already look forward to the next one.<br />My only regret with the Rostnikov series is that I started with book eight in the series, instead of book one.

But after reading Ten Big Ones, I felt that Evanovich was running out of steam with Plum, and therefore, was a little reluctant to read Metro Girl.  A friend passed Metro Girl along to me, and it took only one chapter to become hooked.<br /><br />Alexandra \\"Barney\\" Barnaby is quite different than Stephanie Plum.  With a background in engineering and auto mechanics, Barney works for an insurance company and lives in Baltimore.  Her brother, Wild Bill, goes missing after a mysterious phone call, and she flies down to Miami to search for him.  She quickly teams up with a famous NASCAR driver, Sam Hooker, when it is discovered that Wild Bill stole Hooker's multi-million dollar boat.  While Barney and Sam are looking for Bill, they discover there are some bad guys also looking for him-and they want first dibs.  They're also trying to scare Barney and Sam off the case.<br /><br />While the story is fun, the plot is totally unbelievable.  We're talking sunken treasure, gold bars, a biological weapons warhead, and some bizarre federal agents here.  Still, I stayed up late because I wanted to see how it ended.  The characters seems a bit less over-the-top than in the Plum series, although they still have their quirks.<br /><br />Still, there were quite a few chuckles to be had in Metro Girl.  When Sam gives Barney a pink hat with rhinestones spelling SEXY, one character observes \\"Totally tasteless.  Very trashy.  It's perfect Miami.\\"  Or when Barney observes that hot, humid Miami air, \\"it was stuck on my face and caught in my hair.  It was the McDonald's milk shake of air.  You had to work to suck it in.\\"  I can relate--we have air like that in the summers in New Jersey, only it doesn't last as long.<br /><br />So, read Metro Girl if you're looking for something fun and fast, but don't expect serious mystery here.	2005-03-07

Peter Collier's The Roosevelt's: An American Saga, is a fascinating look at this famous family.  Most people have a general knowledge of presidents Theodore Roosevelt (TR) and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR), but they may not be aware of the extended family history.<br /><br />The saga of the Roosevelt's in America begins with the arrival of Claes Martenszen van Rosenvelt in the 1600's.  But this story really belongs to TR and FDR.  The two presidents were 5th cousins, and came from different branches of this prolific family.  TR was part of the Oyster Bay  clan, while FDR came from the Hyde Park branch.  Their families weren't particularly close, although they did move in the same New York social circles.  They even pronounced their names differently (\\"Roos-e-velt\\" vs. \\"Rose-e-velt\\").<br /><br />TR blazed a political path as he became governor of New York, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, vice president, and then president.  TR wanted his son to continue his political trailblazing, but the young Teddy Jr. was unable to do so.  Along came FDR and while he belonged to a different political party, he followed TR's example almost to the letter (governor of New York, Assistant Naval Secretary and then president).  But instead of bringing the families closer together, it actually drove a wedge between them.  FDR was always considered a lightweight by the Oyster Bay side.  Now he was looked  upon as a traitor and  a usurper.  Some of the Oyster Bay Roosevelt's even campaigned against FDR.  Eleanor Roosevelt (an Oyster Bay Roosevelt who married her Hyde Park cousin) was a bridge between the two groups, but even that wasn't always enough.  While everyone tried to remain civil, it wasn't always possible.  For a time, Alice Longworth (TR's oldest daughter) was banned from the White House because of her vitriolic tongue, and constant snide remarks and mimicking of Eleanor.<br /><br />While the Roosevelt's had great personal successes, they also suffered their share of tragedies.  Alcoholism ran in the Oyster Bay side, and Elliott Roosevelt (TR's brother and Eleanor's father) died at the age of 34 from the disease.  Eleanor's brother, Hall, also met an early death from alcoholism.  TR's youngest son, Quentin, was killed in World War II.  Another son, Kermit, committed suicide in 1943, and his son Dirck, also killed himself ten years later.  A son-in-law and daughter-in-law of FDR also took their own lives.  It is often very difficult being the children of strong, dynamic and famous men, and Collier relates how hard it was for the Roosevelt children and grandchildren to live in the shadows of these great men.  TR's children always strived to measure up to their Rough Rider father, but without great success.  FDR's children were an undisciplined, spoiled and dysfunctional group, and had 19 marriages between the five of them.  None of the children or grandchildren in the two groups was able to carry on the political legacy left by their fathers.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed The Roosevelt's as it provides much little known information about this important family.  Collier also shows that the story doesn't end with TR and FDR after all, although the Roosevelt's on the world stage stopped with the death of Eleanor.of tragedies.

In The Roosevelt Women by Betty Boyd Caroli, the author gives us a fascinating look at the Roosevelt women from primarily the Oyster Bay branch of this venerable family.  Most of us have a general knowledge of presidents Theodore Roosevelt (TR) and Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR).  We also have some idea of the contributions of Eleanor Roosevelt to the world stage.  The story of Eleanor Roosevelt and her female kin (grandmother, aunts and cousins) is in some respects even more remarkable than that of the Roosevelt men.<br /><br />The book starts with Martha \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch Roosevelt, TR's mother.  This beautiful Southern Belle married the senior Theodore Roosevelt.  While often times spoiled, fragile and frivolous, she was also a caring mother and patient teacher to her children.  According to Caroli, she withdrew from \\"family competition\\" in order that her plain daughters would \\"feel superior to her, to develop both wit and charm sufficient to outshine her inordinately good looks.\\"  Though she never lived to see her four granddaughters, they all credited her for her contributions to the Roosevelt family.<br /><br />Mittie's daughters, Anna Roosevelt Cowles and Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, provide the most engrossing characters in The Roosevelt Women.  While not well schooled, they were both bright, articulate and politically astute women.  They surrounded themselves with powerful, witty and intelligent men and their houses were the center of lively and sparkling conversation.  In later life, Corinne became a published poet and a public speaker.  While these sisters were trailblazers in many ways, they were content to stay in the shadow of their more famous brother, TR, and never flaunted their relationship with him.  Yet, they did everything in their power to help TR reach his political goals.  It has been said that if Anna, Corinne and Teddy were all alive today, the women would make better presidential material.<br /><br />Subsequent chapters cover the lives of Mittie's daughter-in-law, Edith (TR's second wife), Eleanor Roosevelt, Corinne Robinson Alsop (Corinne's daughter), Alice Longworth (TR's oldest daughter), and Ethel Derby (TR's youngest daughter).  \\"Princess Alice\\" is probably the most colorful of the group and was considered the \\"other Washington Monument.\\"  TR once said of his wayward and headstrong daughter \\"I can run the country, or I can control Alice.  I cannot possibly do both.\\"<br /><br />The Roosevelt Women is a very readable book, and often seems more like a novel than a work of nonfiction. But this is by no means the complete story of all the Roosevelt women, as there is very little on the Hyde Park side of the family (Eleanor Roosevelt was an Oyster Bay Roosevelt before she married her 5th cousin, Franklin)  Sara Delano Roosevelt (FDR's mom) does not rate her own chapter. Also, there are no women covered in depth after the generation of Mittie's granddaughters.

Parker, is a bit of a change for the author in that it is a work of historic fiction.  While this story is first rate and well written, my own prejudices kept me from giving it a higher rating.<br /><br />Joseph Burke comes out of World War II both emotionally and physically scarred.  Not knowing what to do with his life, he ends up moving from boxing to loan collection to body guarding.  After the job of guarding a mobster's daughter ends badly, Burke is hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers to guard Jackie Robinson as he breaks into the majors in 1947.  Burke's job is to protect Robinson from those wishing him harm, as well as to protect Robinson from himself.  Burke is an entirely fictitious character, although I've been told that Robinson did have a bodyguard during this period.<br /><br />Things get pretty hairy during the season, and Robinson suffers from prejudice, bigotry, discrimination, intimidation and even death threats.  Throughout, Robinson and Burke become reluctant friends, and each helps the other to grow in ways they didn't expect.  Burke (who happens to be white) also gets to experience first hand the ugly face of discrimination.  They have trouble finding hotels, restaurants and cabs that will accept both black and white clients.  For Burke, this proves to be an eye-opening experience.<br /><br />But my own expectations interfered with my enjoyment of Double Play.  As a person fascinated by history, I have a problem with books that use historical figures and weave fictional tales around them.  In reading Double Play, I was left to wonder how much of it was based on the truth.  Also, I found that the dialogue between Burke and Robinson started sounding much like Parker's more famous characters, Spenser and Hawk. While a riveting tale, it's not exactly a long one, and I was able to finish this book in a day (not something I normally can do).<br /><br />Still, Parker does a fine job in Double Play, and especially, with fleshing out Joseph Burke (this is really his story).  That alone is worth the price of admission.h fleshing out Joseph Burke (this is really his story).  That alone is worth the price of admission. <br />	2005-03-02

Kate Atkinson has given her reader a gripping, moving tale in her latest book, Case Histories.  The first three chapters provide us with three tragic crimes that took place in England years apart.  In each of these case histories, there is some element that is unresolved.  Family members in each of these stories hire PI Jackson Brodie to provide some answers that the police could not give them.  Brodie, a former police inspector, works on these three at the same time, and although they're not related, they still intersect at various points.<br /><br />Where Atkinson excels in Case Histories is her character development.  The characters are a depressing lot, but we grow to like most of them in spite of themselves.  They seem to have trouble dealing with life, yet some parts of Case Histories are downright hysterical.  Almost all of them are haunted by ghosts, and we find that Brodie is no exception.<br /><br />Atkinson also does a good job of weaving together an intricate and very believable plot.  There is a lot to juggle here with the different stories going on at once, but Atkinson makes it seem easy.  In addition to Brodie trying to solve these cases, there is also someone trying to murder him.  He has good success in finding new clues to crimes that are decades old, but not everything is resolved and not all questions are answered.  Overall, Case Histories is an excellent book and I'm anxious to read more of Atkinson.	2005-02-28

Parker, some books are going to be better than others.  Bad Business, the 31st book in his Spenser series, is better than many of his later efforts.<br /><br />Marlene Rowley hires Spenser to tail her husband, who she suspects of having an affair.  Husband, Trent, is a big executive at an energy company called Kinergy (think Enron).  It quickly becomes apparent that Spenser isn't the only PI following people around, and when Trent ends up murdered (in his Kinergy office no less), Marlene then engages Spenser to find the killer.  Marlene is totally obnoxious and self-centered, and is not an easy person to work for.  Spenser encountered lots of twists and turns, and not only is there the business angle, but there are also sex seminars, wife-swapping, an escort service, missing PI's, another murder and a host of other possible motives.<br /><br />But what makes Parker so much fun to read is his witty, snappy, first-rate dialogue.  Spenser interviewing possible suspects is a hoot.  The conversation between Spenser and Hawk is even better.  So even though this book could have been a bit longer, it was definitely worth reading.  Too bad they stopped filming the Spenser television series, as Bad Business would have made one dandy episode.	2005-02-28

Within two years, they became close friends, traveling companions and confidants.  Edna Gurewitsch chronicles the relationship between her husband and Mrs. Roosevelt in Kindred Souls:  The Devoted Friendship of Eleanor Roosevelt and Dr. David Gurewitsch.<br /><br />Eleanor Roosevelt was one of the most intelligent, gifted, powerful, energetic yet humble women of the 20th Century.  But despite all these attributes, she suffered from a definite lack of confidence in her abilities.  This lack of self-esteem had several roots including her miserable childhood, her insensitive husband, her domineering mother-in-law and the shabby treatment she suffered by her five self-centered, spoiled and undisciplined children.  To compensate for this serious lacking, Mrs. Roosevelt surrounded herself with an orbit of friends who served as her surrogate family.  Mrs. Roosevelt demanded much from her friends, but rewarded them with love, loyalty, devotion and generosity.  Her list included Esther Lape, Marion Dickerman, Nancy Cook, Lorena Hickock, Joe Lash, and others.  Dr. Gurewitsch was her closest friend for the last 15 years of her life.  Right before her death, she wrote to him \\"above all others, you are the one to whom my heart is tied.\\"  Once David married the author, they became a threesome.  They even shared a house together until Mrs. Roosevelt's death in 1962.<br /><br />Edna Gurewitsch's book can best be described as a lovefest.  Her fawning descriptions of her \\"perfect\\" husband become very nauseating very quickly.  If there are any warts exposed in Kindred Souls, they belong to Mrs. Roosevelt. She could be demanding and emotionally needy at times, and often revealed a jealousy toward those she felt were usurping her attention.  There were often intrigues between her children and her friends, and even among her friends, as each group vied for Mrs. Roosevelt's love in return.  Her children were the worst, as they often found themselves on the outside looking in.<br /><br />For a Roosevelt fan, there is not much new information to be had, except for the background of Dr. Gurewitsch (which may be interesting, but is not the reason I purchased this book).  For most readers, I'd recommend skipping Kindred Souls and reading instead one of Joseph Lash's Roosevelt biographies, or better yet, Blanche Wiesen Cook's two-part biography on Mrs. Roosevelt (which I understand will eventually be six books in all).he worst, as they often found themselves on the outside looking in.   <br /> <br />For a Roosevelt fan, there is not much new information to be had, except for the background of Dr. Gurewitsch (which may be interesting, but is not the reason I purchased this book).

Instead of a start to finish biography, it is actually a series of snippets from Franklin's long life. The sections are broken into the themes of The Dogood Papers, Franklin and Electricity, The Albany Congress of 1754, Franklin is Fifty, Franklin in London and The Making of a Revolutionary.<br /><br />I was not very impressed with the first two sections.  Extensive biographies by Walter Isaacson and others cover these areas in greater detail.  But Bowen really comes on strong with her chapters about The Albany Congress.  A group of representatives from most of the colonies met in Albany, New York in 1754.  The purpose was to meet with the Iroquois Confederacy to gain their support against the French, and to purchase large tracts of land.  Franklin brought to the table a plan to merge the colonies to form a \\"general government.\\"  While the goal at this time was not independence, Franklin felt that the colonies would be better able to defend themselves, would be able to combine some budget items and also, would gain some bargaining power against the British.  While the representatives at Albany unanimously supported Franklin's Plan of Union, the individual colonies rejected it as they were afraid of losing their autonomy.  Why this is so important is that it provided a dress rehearsal for what was to come 22 years later.<br /><br />Subsequent chapters were also very fascinating and Bowen chronicles how Franklin progresses from staunch Englishman to Revolutionary.  He is definitely one of the most fascinating men of the 1700's and perhaps one of the most brilliant.  But the book stops in 1775 and has nothing on the last 15 years of Franklin's life.<br /><br />In Bowen's defense, she passed away while writing the last chapter of The Most Dangerous Man in America.  Knowing that she was dying of cancer, perhaps she had to rush the writing of this as there was much more that she could have included.  Still, if you're a Ben Franklin fan, it can fill in a number of information gaps.  But if you're looking for a comprehensive book on Franklin's life and work, there are better, more thorough books to be read., perhaps she had to rush the writing of this as there was much more that she could have included.

In Pat Conroy's first book, The Water is Wide, he writes of a universal theme: young idealistic man sets out to change the world and runs into a brick wall.  But while this story has been told by other writers, nobody writes with the passion and emotion of Conroy.<br /><br />The Water is Wide is based on Conroy's experiences of teaching on Daufuskie Island in the late 1960's (thinly disguised as Wamacraw Island in the book).  After his application was turned down for the Peace Corps, Conroy applied for a job teaching black children on this isolated sea island off the South Carolina coast.  His 18 charges were from the upper elementary grades.  What he discovered was an unbelievable shock.  These 18 students did not know what country they lived in, the name of their president, or what ocean lapped their beach. Some couldn't read or write, recognize the alphabet, write their names or count to ten.  Also, none of these children who lived surrounded by water could swim.  Everything Conroy had learned about teaching was obsolete on Daufuskie, and he had to be flexible in his methodology in teaching his students to learn.  Unfortunately, he hits one roadblock after another from supervisors, the superintendent, the school board, his only colleague and even the parents (who liked what Conroy was doing, but didn't want their children leaving the island for trips).  He also runs into hypocrisy, inertia, prejudice, and jealousy.<br /><br />While Conroy is trying to teach his students, they are giving him an education as well.  While the kids from nearby Beaufort are worrying about the homecoming dance, what costume to wear for Halloween, dating, and a host of other non-serious topics, the Daufuskie kids have to deal with poverty, substandard levels of education, alcoholic parents, violence and a host of very serious issues for children so young.  Yet, his students are honest to a fault and very endearing.  Conroy is amazed and enlightened to see the world through their eyes.<br /><br />But Conroy wasn't fated to remain at Daufuskie very long, and not all endings are happy.  He claims to have not made much of an impact on his students (most readers will disagree).  Much of the pristine Daufuskie Island has been turned into a golfing resort.  Many of the same problems still plague the islanders.  Yet, his short-lived career as a teacher gave him the story that really began his literary career. Not many young writers can boast that their first commercial effort not only became a major bestseller, but also a major motion picture (Conrack with Jon Voight). Conroy's agent, Julian Bach, first read The Water is Wide and told him that he was a natural writer and would write many more successful books.  Bach's crystal ball was certainly working well that day as Conroy has since published The Lords of Discipline, The Great Santini, The Prince of Tides, My Losing Season and Beach Music.

After reading Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible, I was impressed enough to read some of her earlier works.  High Tide in Tucson: Essays from Now or Never, is actually a collection of essays, articles, opinions and speeches that first appeared in a number of places including magazines like Smithsonian, Parenting, and The New York Times Magazine.  Although most of them are excellent, on the whole, they are a little uneven.<br /><br />Kingsolver was first a biologist, and many of the articles are written through a scientist's eye.  Her love of nature shines through when she writes about the flora and fauna of her native Kentucky and her adopted home of Tucson.  She tells us about the joys of parenting and the heartache of a failed marriage. She regales us with tales of traveling and living abroad for a spell.  And she also preaches from her soapbox on a number of political and domestic issues (including nuclear weapons, The Gulf War, the mistreatment of children in the US, limited efforts at conservation, working out, her lack of fashion sense, and the trials and tribulations of writing-to name a few).  One of her funniest chapters is about a two-week tour she took as part of a rock band, The Rock Bottom Remainders.  This band consisted of fellow writers, and we can only imagine Kingsolver, Amy Tan, Stephen King, Dave Barry and others sounding more like \\"Hound Dogs in Heat.\\"<br /><br />But what makes High Tide in Tucson different from many other collections is Kingsolver's beautiful prose.  About the Santa Cruz River, she writes \\"In these lean days, she's a great blank channel of sand, but we call her a river anyway, and say it with a straight face too, because in her moods this saint has taken out bridges and houses and people who loved their lives.\\"  Or in describing a sunset, Kingsolver shares with us \\"No one else to see the sun go huge and round, then drown itself, burning a red path of memory on the face of the sea.\\"  Much of High Tide reads like poetry.<br /><br />So while I liked some essays much better than others, overall, I think High Tide is a very worthy book.  Kingsolver has become one of our best writers today.try. <br /> <br />So while I liked some essays much better than others, overall, I think High Tide is a very worthy book.

Most mystery writers today produce books that are like cotton candy:  they're light, fluffy, give you a quick sugar high, and are ultimately unsatisfying in the long run.  Unfortunately, most of these writers produce a book a year-whether they have anything new to say or not.  Once in a great while, a mystery writer comes along whose work is so broad in scope as to resemble great literature.  Martin Cruz Smith belongs to this elite group, and Gorky Park is one of the best mysteries ever written.<br /><br />Arkady Renko is Chief Investigator of Homicide for the city of Moscow before the fall of communism.  While he has a 100% success rate in investigating homicides, his personal life is less than stellar.  Renko is called in when three faceless, fingerless bodies are discovered in the snow at Gorky Park during a spring thaw.  He is able to take what little evidence there is, and starts putting together the pieces of this complicated puzzle.  The closer he gets to the truth, the more evident it is that someone (maybe the KGB or even someone in his own office) does not want him to solve this crime.<br /><br />But what makes Gorky Park so fascinating is the Russian angle.  Solving crimes and investigative techniques are a bit different than in the United States (they tend to use a lot of vodka, for one thing).  Not only does Arkady have the party bureaucracy to contend with, but the KGB is also looking over his shoulder.  It is often hard to tell who are the bad guys.  We also get a glimpse of what it was like to live in Soviet Russia.  Professionals like Renko didn't get very high salaries, and living conditions were often spartan.<br /><br />But where Cruz Smith really excels is in his characters. Renko is probably one of the most memorable characters in any mystery.  He is a very likable, sympathetic man with a kind heart.  His humble, self-deprecating manner belies a brilliant mind, which he needs to fight not just criminals, but also the Soviet system.  But Renko also carries a lot of baggage, and it sometimes interferes with his job.<br /><br />Cruz Smith's plot will keep you up nights, reading to find out what happens. Gorky Park is also filled with ironic wit.  Renko never tries to take himself too seriously, and we learn that humor is the best way to survive in the Soviet Union.  When one character tells Renko that he wants to kill him, Renko responds \\"this is Russia.  Get in line.\\"  The exchange between Renko and an FBI agent about defection will have you in stitches.<br /><br />If Gorky Park isn't the best mystery written today, it's certainly close to the top of the list.Renko also carries a lot of baggage, and it sometimes interferes with his job.   <br /> <br />Cruz Smith's plot will keep you up nights, reading to find out what happens.

I have been with Sue Grafton since A is for Alibi, and the best that I can say about the 18th book in the Kinsey Milhone series, R is for Ricochet, is that it is mediocre.  In Ricochet, Grafton is very short on plot and very long on tedious description.  It's definitely not a riveting tale.<br /><br />Wealthy, retired businessman, Nord Lafferty, hires Kinsey for a different kind of job.  Nord has a ne'er-do-well daughter, Reba, who is about to be released from jail.  Her sentence was for embezzling money from her job.  Reba also has issues with alcohol, drugs and gambling.  Kinsey is hired to serve as babysitter and chauffeur.  Much to Kinsey's surprise, Reba is a likable sort, and Kinsey is drawn to help her-even after her assignment is finished.  Milhone figures out that the embezzlement case is more than it seems, and the deeper she digs, the murkier the situation becomes.<br /><br />But what makes this book a disappointment is the heavy dose of description.  It's not just enough for Grafton to tell us that there are flowers in front of a house.  She also has to regale us with what they are, what they look like (including height, color, etc.), how they smell, the sound of them rustling in the wind, and even their texture.  A description of a toilet seat goes on for a paragraph. Enough already!  It's like taking a bite of a big sandwich and finding very little meat.  The subplots were also unnecessary.  Henry's love interest (Kinsey's landlord) and his feud with his brothers is totally annoying and doesn't add one thing to this book.  The story finally starts moving, but not until chapter 28.<br /><br />Still, I gave R is for Ricochet 3 stars because even a mediocre Grafton is much better than a good effort by many mystery writers today.  There is just too much fluff out there.  So when \\"S\\" comes along, I'll give it a try (but maybe I'll wait for the paperback version next time).	2005-01-12

One of the best parts about a Margaret Truman mystery is the insight into the Washington DC institutions that are featured in her books.  Murder in the Library of Congress is no exception, and we get a fascinating look inside this venerable but widely overlooked treasure.<br /><br />Former lawyer and current art gallery owner, Annabel Reed-Smith, takes a two month sabbatical from her gallery to write an article that will appear in the Library of Congress magazine, Civilization.  The article will be about Columbus' friend and colleague, Bartolome' Las Casas.  Reed-Smith plans to spend two months in the Library of Congress doing research for this article.  Many experts believe that Las Casas kept diaries and even a treasure map from the three voyages he made with Columbus.  But many people searching for these diaries have met with tragic fates.  Almost as soon as Annabel arrives at the library, she discovers the body of the number one Las Casas expert in the world.  Unfortunately, he's been murdered.  Also, 8 years prior to this, another Las Casas expert (who also worked at the library) vanished without a trace.  Annabel quickly becomes immersed in trying to solve these mysteries.<br /><br />While the premise of the plot is plausible, how Annabel seems to always be at the center of things is not.  She is consulted by the police, asked to examine possible clues, and kept up to date on the investigation.  This is the Washington DC Metro Police, not Mayberry RFD.  Also, Annabel's perfect life is just a little too nauseating.<br /><br />Still, the star of this book is the Library of Congress.  She gives both a thumbnail sketch of its history, as well as procedures of operation today.  After reading Murder in the Library of Congress, I'll definitely put it on my list of places to visit during my next trip to Washington.	2005-01-04

In Diane Mott Davidson's The Grilling Season, caterer and amateur sleuth Goldy Schulz once again finds herself in the soup. Goldy discovers the body of Suz Craig, lying in a ditch by the side of the road.  Craig was a vice president of a local HMO, and also the girlfriend of Goldy's ex-husband, Dr. John Richard Korman.  When her body is found, Dr. Korman (prominent ob/gyn) is arrested for her murder.  Korman has a history of brutal physical and verbal abuse toward women, although most people in small Aspen Meadows know little about this violent side.<br /><br />Goldy is a key witness in the case and is told not to interfere in any way with the investigation.  But when she can't stand the whining of her 14 year old son, she agrees to snoop around.  She quickly discovers that Suz Craig is not very well liked (personally or professionally) and that there are plenty of individuals with a good motive for the killing.  Throughout her snooping, Goldy continually cooks and prepares for catering affairs.  The book is sprinkled with a number of recipes for foods mentioned in The Grilling Season.<br /><br />This is my third book of this series, and I'm not really that impressed.  The plots are simple and many of the characters are truly annoying.  Also, for someone who likes to cook, I find the recipes are not even tempting.  This book was a little better than the last book I read, but I'd much rather read Grafton or Evanovich.  There are too many other good mystery series out there.  But at least it's a light, fluffy and very fast read.	2004-12-31

I first read Janet Evanovich's Hard Eight in hardback, and then recently listened to the unabridged audio version on tape.  This book made a long and tedious car trip much more enjoyable.<br /><br />At the beginning of Hard Eight, Stephanie Plum's world is pretty normal for her.  She shares an apartment with her hamster, mooches meals off her folks, hasn't had a date in months, is still torn between Ranger and Morelli, and keeps a gun in her cookie jar (with no bullets).  Things quickly change when a neighbor asks for some help.  The neighbor put her house up for a child custody bond, and is in danger of losing her house when her daughter and granddaughter disappear.  Stephanie agrees to \\"look into it,\\" but when Plum is around, you can be sure it won't be done with discreteness.  In fact, she uses the stumble-bumble method of investigation.<br /><br />Stephanie soon finds herself in a mystery that is more complicated than a simple missing persons case.  She also finds herself up against a number of bad guys including a psychopathic war-gamer and four men in costumes (a bunny, a bear, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon).  As the case unfolds, it is difficult to estimate whether Plum loses more handcuffs, cell phones, vehicles or FTA's (failures to appear).  Dead bodies also turn up all over Trenton including one on her living room couch.  Evanovich's observations about Trenton and New Jersey are a scream and the plot will have you laughing out loud.<br /><br />My one complaint about the audio version is that the reader, Lorelei King, has perfect diction.  People from New Jersey (and especially Trenton) don't have perfect diction. It hurts my ears to hear Trenton pronounced with two \\"t's\\" (it should be pronounced Tren-un) and Mazur butchered in every book recorded so far.  Mazur has a long \\"a\\" with the accent on the first syllable.  There have been numerous readers for the Evanovich series, and each one has pronounced it differently and each one was wrong.  Just once, it would be nice for a reader to consult with the author for correct pronunciations.<br /><br />But despite this, Hard Eight is a fun book.  Some books have been stronger than others, and this is one of the better ones.  Let's hope Evanovich still has some tricks up her sleeve.e, it would be nice for a reader to consult with the author for correct pronunciations.   <br /> <br />But despite this, Hard Eight is a fun book.

Pat Conroy is my favorite author, and it is fitting that he dedicates the same passion for cooking as he does for his writing in his new book, The Pat Conroy Cookbook.  The fact that Conroy is so fascinated with food is in itself ironic.  Conroy grew up in a house where food was important, but good food was not.  In fact, he regrets that his mother \\"looked upon food as a necessity, not a realm of art.\\"  Her idea of seafood every Friday night was fish sticks. This all changed when his wife announced that she was going to law school, and he would have to start preparing the meals for his family (consisting of three young daughters).  Conroy is an avid reader and a keen observer, so he began his education in earnest.  First, he went to the local bookstore.  Instead of recommending something basic and easy (like Betty Crocker), the owner talked Conroy into purchasing a book by the French chef, Escoffier.  Soon, he was immersed in the world of making stock, roux and exotic foods.  He discovered that cooking could be great  fun, and combined the skills of being an artist with those needed to become a mad chemist.<br /><br />As part of his culinary education, Conroy also became an avid collector.  He collected cookbooks, and especially enjoyed those homey books published by churches and civic groups.  They not only offered great recipes, but also precious nuggets of knowledge such as \\"store mushrooms and string beans in a brown paper bag in the refrigerator, not in plastic.\\"  Next, he started a collection of culinary friends.  Some were cooks, some were chefs, and others just enjoyed good food.  Then he started collecting recipes.  Many came from friends and family, others he created or recreated.  He added foods to his repertoire (things such as white asparagus and escargot).  He took a number of cooking classes, and finally, he started traveling.  Living in Rome and France for extended periods introduced him to whole new cuisines.  While I'm not sure that Conroy has become a master chef, he certainly must be an accomplished one.<br /><br />But you can bet that Conroy would not be content to just compile recipes for a book.  The Pat Conroy Cookbook reads more like a memoir with a generous helping of recipes sprinkled here and there.  Each chapter describes a story, saga or anecdote about his life, and is then followed with related recipes.  He tells of preparing a bridesmaid's luncheon for his daughter, cooking for his dying father, and foods to make for funerals.  He talks about foods from Italy and France, and honeymooning in Umbria.  He provides chapters on oyster roasts, pig roasts, Vidalia onions, and grilling.  He regales us with the best meals that his has eaten-both in restaurants and out.  And he tells us of the relationship between food and his writing.<br /><br />The recipes themselves are interesting, intriguing and not too intimidating.  For those that are more complicated, Conroy takes us through them step by step. He also provides the reader with some of those nuggets of wisdom he so admires in church cookbooks, such as drain fried foods on paper bags and not paper towels.  I will definitely try a number of them-especially the low country specialties like shrimp and grits, crab cakes, and pickled shrimp.<br /><br />So whether you like Pat Conroy or cooking, you will love this cookbook.  Not only will it tempt your palate, but it will also provide the reader with a generous dose of \\"The World According to Pat Conroy.\\"  What a tasty treat, indeed.ecome a master chef, he certainly must be an accomplished one. <br /> <br />But you can bet that Conroy would not be content to just compile recipes for a book.

He has been a widower for many years, reveres his Confederate ancestors and the Confederate cause, and lives in an antebellum mansion that hasn't seen paint or repairs in decades.  Dying of cancer, the judge summons his sons home to Clanton to discuss his estate. Nathan \\"Ray\\" Atlee is a law professor at the University of Virginia.  Forrest has struggled with a lifetime drug addiction and lives in Memphis. The judge was not a particularly good father, and both sons dread being summoned back home and go very reluctantly.<br /><br />The story starts moving when Ray arrives home to find the judge already dead.  Things seem neat and tidy (a will on the desk, $6000 in the bank, etc.).  But they take a bizarre turn when Ray finds $3.1 million stacked in boxes in a cabinet behind the couch in the judge's study.  His questions are endless:  Where did the money come from?  Is it dirty?  Is it counterfit?  Should he include it in the estate?  Should he tell Forrest?  Ray starts on a trek to discover the answers to his many questions.  He quickly sees that his life is in danger because of it as someone else has knowledge of the money.  He also comes to realize that the fact that this money will become his is very appealing to him.<br /><br />Ray eventually finds the answers to most of his questions, but the ending is a little rushed and a bit open-ended.  I figured out fairly quickly who the villain was (not something I usually do).  The Summons just doesn't pack the punch of his earlier novels.  I will continue to read Grisham, but will not purchase these novels in hardback.	2004-12-28

My father and my husband (Navy men and boaters, both) had high praise for Robert Kurson's Shadow Divers.  They told me that if I liked The Perfect Storm, I'd love Shadow Divers.  Was I floored by this fabulous story!  In fact, I can't believe that this book hasn't made more of a splash (no pun intended).<br /><br />Shadow Divers chronicles the discovery of a German U-boat off the coast of New Jersey in 1991.  While I remember the press reports of the initial discovery, the saga actually covers a period of six years and is far more engrossing than the original press.<br /><br />The first part of Shadow Divers details the world of wreck divers (not to be confused with pleasure divers).  These divers challenge physical limits and risk their lives with each dive for a number of reasons.  Some like to collect artifacts, more wish to make new discoveries, and others dive just for the thrill and the challenge.  There's also the temptation of sunken treasure and sudden wealth.  After reading this, you will question their sanity.<br /><br />After the discovery of the U-boat (nicknamed U-Who), John Chatterton and Rich Kohler undertake an extensive research project.  They wish to identify the sub, they want to know how it sunk, and they also want to learn what it was doing 60 miles off the New Jersey coast.  They talked to experts, read countless books, and traveled to Washington DC, Chicago and Germany.  What is fascinating is that Naval Archives from the United States, England and Germany were often incorrect on the fate of U-boats (as Chatterton and Kohler soon come to discover).<br /><br />The last part of the book deals with the hardships of serving on a U-boat.  The U-boat fleet lost its effectiveness as the United States developed better technology.  By the end of the war, almost 55% of all U-boat sailors were killed.  Living and working on a sub was a real challenge, and we can only imagine 50-60 men being confined to such cramped quarters for weeks at a time with no showers, clean clothes and little for diversion.  It is also frightening to contemplate what these men must have gone through when they knew their sub was doomed.<br /><br />The U-Who sunk with 56 men aboard to become an underwater war grave, but this fateful vessel claimed many more victims.  During this saga, the U-Who left broken marriages, broken men, and even dead divers in its wake.  But Chatterton and Kohler are finally able to solve most of the U-boat mystery and in doing so, they also learn a great deal about themselves.<br /><br />Shadow Divers is a riveting story, and one of the best nonfiction reads in 2004.  It was even more enjoyable as most of it takes place in my native NJ.  I just can't say enough good things about this book.for diversion.

I am a Jersey girl (minus the big hair and the spandex) and live about 20 minutes from \\"The Burg.\\"  Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series was a perfect fit.  But with her latest effort, Ten Big Ones, I feel that Evanovich is starting to lose some of her momentum.  This isn't the caliber I have come to expect from her.<br /><br />I fell in love with Stephanie Plum because this series is different:  the plots are quirky, the characters are hysterical and the antics are a scream.  When I first started reading the series, I had tears rolling down my cheeks from laughing so hard.  In Ten Big Ones, Stephanie finds herself pitted against the mob.  The plot is rather trite and Stephanie makes one stupid decision after another.  Even the subplots (which are usually entertaining) are boring.  Who cares about Stephanie's sister and her impending marriage?  When will Plum ever decide between Morelli and Ranger?  Even Grandma Mazur disappoints.  The ending wraps up way too quickly and is very contrived.  Either Evanovich rushed this book to meet a deadline, or her editor dropped the ball on this one.<br /><br />Toward the end of Ten Big Ones, Ranger tells Stephanie that \\"the guys like you-you're entertaining.\\"  Well, Ten Big Ones does not provide us with the entertainment we've come to expect from Evanovich.  I will continue to read the Plum series, but hope for a better effort with number eleven.	2004-12-15

If ever there was a royal web, it was spun by Queen Victoria.  Between her children and her grandchildren, they occupied almost every royal house in Europe. The Royal Web: by Ladislas Farago and Andrew Sinclair chronicles just one small part of Victoria's web-the royal house of Prussia.<br /><br />Princess Victoria (Vicky) was Victoria and Albert's oldest child.  She was probably the most intelligent and politically astute of all the children.  Knowing that she would never be a monarch in he own right, her parents recognized that an advantageous marriage would allow her to become queen, or even empress of another power.  Albert had visions of a united Germany, and from the time Vicky was still an infant, he set his sights on Vicky marrying into the Prussian Royal Family.  With this goal in mind, he set out to educate Vicky in a way that he never did his oldest son, Bertie (later King Edward VII).  While Vicky was still a teen, she married the Prussian prince, Frederick .  Fritz was the son of Emperor William I, and spent much of his married life as the Crown Prince.<br /><br />The marriage of Fritz and Vicky was a love match-one of the few among royalty in the 1800's.  Both had a liberal vision for the future of Germany.  Unfortunately, Emperor William I and Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck did not share this view.  In fact, they did everything possible to suppress the liberals, and Vicky was even accused of being an English spy.  This was also a turbulent time for the Prussians as the war-hungry Bismarck goaded Prussians into war with the Danes, Austrians, French and even fellow German states.  By the time Fritz became emperor, it was too late to make any major changes.<br /><br />At first, I thought this was going to be a basic biography on Fritz and Vicky.  But it was short on personal history (little is mentioned about their children except for William, who became Kaiser William II).  It also gets bogged down in battles, wars, espionage, and political intrigue.  While the authors try to simplify the history of Germany during this time (which consisted of 38 independent German states), it would have been helpful to include a map of Europe and Germany.<br /><br />Overall, Royal Web was an interesting work.  One thing that the authors had at their disposal was the many volumes of letters between Victoria and Vicky (they wrote almost daily).  The relationship between the future Kaiser and his parents is also fascinating and disturbing.  Also, while Vicky and Fritz were born into the wealth and privilege of royalty, their lives were filled with tragedies and disappointments.  Things didn't quite play out as expected.  So while I wouldn't discount Royal Web, if you're looking for a straight biography of these two, there are many better books to be found.igue.

In The Runaway Jury, John Grisham tackles the controversial topic of the liability of tobacco companies for the health problems and deaths of smokers.  Celeste Wood lost her 51 year-old husband to lung cancer due to smoking.  After 16 previous law suits brought against tobacco companies (that all ended with either a hung jury or a judgment for the tobacco companies), this trial begins in Biloxi, Mississippi.  We are quickly introduced to Nicholas Easter, who is trying his hardest to be selected for this jury.  Easter has a murky past and we're unsure of his motives.  But he not only is selected for the jury, but also becomes the jury's unofficial leader.  As the jury selection process begins, we learn about the sleazy actions by the tobacco interests to not only make sure that jury members are sympathetic to the tobacco companies, but they also try to buy their votes.<br /><br />During the duration of the trial, Easter and his girlfriend, Marlee, work a scheme that they've been planning for years.  We are not sure which way they will fall or what the real reason for this scheme is, and this book will have you turning pages very quickly to discover what happens.  Grisham takes on some weighty questions including 1) how much should tobacco companies be liable for the harm their products cause 2) do cigarette manufacturers really target children in their advertisements 3) do tobacco companies intentionally keep nicotine levels high to addict more smokers and 4) how much (if anything) should plaintiffs be given for harm done due to smoking?  I think one of the best parts about The Runaway Jury is how 15 complete strangers interacted over a period of weeks.  It is interesting to see the judicial system through the eyes of a juror.<br /><br />But the one thing I disliked about this book was that the plot just seemed too hokey to me.  Maybe I am naive enough to believe that it is impossible for so much jury tampering to go on.  Or that two novices can outsmart ex-FBI and CIA agents.  Even the ending seemed totally unbelievable (and my husband was able to figure it out way before it happened).  Also, while Nicholas and Marlee are putting their plan in action, I wasn't sure if we should root for them, or not.  When someone breaks the law to right a wrong, isn't that still a wrong?<br /><br />So despite some obvious flaws, it was still a quick and entertaining read.

I decided to read Cassandra King's The Sunday Wife for two reasons:  King's husband is Pat Conroy (my favorite author), and The Post and Courier of Charleston, SC gave it a good review.<br /><br />Willowdean \\"Dean\\" Lynch is the wife of a Methodist minister, who happens to be an ambitious and self-serving rising star in the church.  Dean had a difficult childhood and ended up in foster care.  She carries a number of scars from her childhood, the number one being low self-esteem.  But one thing that enriches her life is her musical heritage and her musical talent.<br /><br />She falls for a young, handsome preacher, Ben Lynch, and somehow \\"wins\\" this lucky prize.  But what Dean quickly discovers is that it is not easy being the wife of a minister.  Not only does she live in a fishbowl, but everyone (including Dean) is expected to orbit around her husband.  She is expected to suppress all personal desires including the desire for a musical career and a family.  The bulk of the story begins as Ben takes a job with a prestigious parish in the Florida panhandle.  The adjustment isn't easy for Dean.  But she becomes friends with the \\"rebel\\" Augusta, who slowly gets Dean to open her eyes to the fact that she is not living life on her own terms, and that she is certainly not meeting her potential.  When a crisis occurs, Dean is finally faced with making difficult decisions about her life and her future.<br /><br />The Sunday Wife appealed to me as the cast of characters found in this fictional parish can be found in almost any church.  There were women that were jealous of Dean, women that were overly critical of her, and those who continuously and unashamedly flirted with her husband.  There were control freaks, divas, gossips and those who feigned friendship for the wrong reasons.  Many of them were superficial, holier-than-thou hypocrites.  But there were one or two who truly cared about Dean and opened their hearts to her. King's first husband was also a minister, and we are left to wonder how much of this story is autobiographical.<br /><br />The Sunday Wife isn't a Pat Conroy book by any means.  But I did detect the hand of Conroy in some of the writing-especially in the last chapters.  And while it's not the great literature we've come to expect from Conroy, it is a noble effort just the same, and King has much to share with her readers., and we are left to wonder how much of this story is autobiographical. <br /> <br />The Sunday Wife isn't a Pat Conroy book by any means.

If it is possible for a book to be fascinating and tedious at the same time, Simon Sebag Montefiore's Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar is just that.  This is not your typical Stalin biography.  There is almost nothing about his childhood and his time in the seminary, and just a basic outline of his early days in the party.  Instead, the bulk of this book focuses on 1929 to Stalin's death in 1953.<br /><br />Montefiore sets out to solve the puzzle that is Joseph Stalin-the most complex and contradictory of men.  At times, he showed a tender side.  He was good with children, adored daughter Svetlana, spent hours in his garden and fed the birds daily.  He loved to sing and was partial to the hymns of his youth.  When a minister told Stalin that he had severed ties with his parents because his father was a priest, Stalin sent financial assistance to the family anonymously.  The Soviets hated any monarchy, but Stalin enjoyed the trappings of Imperial Russia and likened himself to a tsar.  He revered Ivan the Terrible, who became his role model.  But words cannot describe the atrocities committed in Stalin's name, and monster is too good a word for him.  His secret police (the NKVD) ruled through brutal, unrestrained terror.  Anyone suspected of being an \\"enemy of the people\\" was jailed, interrogated, tortured, deported, exiled and/or killed.  If one member a family was guilty, the entire family became victims.  He ordered the arrest and murder of friends, rivals, enemies and even his family.  His paranoia was so great that his philosophy was it is better to kill innocent victims than to let one guilty person go free.  Even his policies caused millions of people to perish.  While it is difficult to find any definitive numbers on how many Russian deaths are attributed to Stalin, the guesses range from 20 to 50 million people.<br /><br />This book is not just about Stalin, but also the many ministers, advisors, magnates and extended family that orbited around him.  Early on, they were one big happy, Soviet family.  They lived together in the Kremlin, worked together, played together, and vacationed together in the Crimea.  But during the 1930's, Stalin started the Terror, and many fell victim to his wrath.  Some lived to tell and were eventually given other jobs.  Others weren't so lucky.  Some of the names are familiar (Molotov and Khrushchev), but most are not.  Sometimes it's difficult to keep them all straight.<br /><br />One aspect that brings new life to Stalin's story is that Montefiore had access to newly opened Soviet files.  Some of the stories told here have never been told before.  He also interviewed a number of children and grandchildren of Stalin's various ministers.  They are also able to give a more personal view of Stalin.  But one thing that was tedious about this book was the Russian names.  Many Russians were known by their first name, patronymic, last name, \\"nom de revolution,\\" maiden name, and/or familiar name.  Joseph Stalin was also Joseph Vissarionovich, Joseph Djugashvili, Koba and Soso.  He's easy enough to keep straight, but when Montefiore uses primarily last names, it throws the reader off when he all of a sudden switches to first or familiar names with the other ministers.  One thing that was also disconcerting is that many of those interviewed by Montefiore still believe that Joseph Stalin was a great man.  I couldn't help thinking while reading this book that Montefiore agrees with them.  Still, despite some flaws, Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar is a monumental work and a worthy read for any Russophile.him.  Early on, they were one big happy, Soviet family.

I Know This Much is True by Wally Lamb is one of the best books that I have read this year, and it's fitting that this powerful and moving story was chosen as an Oprah Book Club selection.<br /><br />Forty-one year old Dominick Birdsey has not much going right in his life.  His identical twin, Thomas, suffers from schizophrenia, he's divorced from a woman he still loves, his mother has died of cancer without revealing the identity of his real father, and he has a complex and frosty relationship with his abusive stepfather.  When his brother goes off the deep end, Dominick starts meeting with Thomas' psychiatrist.  Dr. Patel soon discovers that both brothers are \\"lost in the woods\\" and that the \\"normal\\" twin also needs much help.  She takes Dominick on a voyage of discovery through the past (both his and his family's), and starts him on a mission of renovation.  In the process of therapy, Dominick sees how it is possible to love, hate and resent those he loves at the same time.  He learns the keys to friendship, betrayal and forgiveness.  He discovers that arrogance and \\"power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed.\\"  Throughout this process, he discovers that he actually has two fathers, rather than none.  And he is also able to incorporate the best qualities of his twin to become a much better and more sensitive man.<br /><br />I was reluctant to pick up I Know This Much Is True because of the length (901 pages), but I ended up reading it in record time.  I just couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  At first, this book reminded me of Pat Conroy's The Prince of Tides.  On first look, there are many similarities:  one twin with mental problems, an abusive father/stepfather, a psychiatrist who realizes that the \\"healthy\\" twin also needs help.  But the more I read, the more I realized that Wally Lamb's story is all his own. Now I'm sorry that I let this book sit on my nightstand gathering dust for over a year.  Several friends have told me that they enjoyed Lamb's first effort, She's Come Undone, even more.

I enjoy books that have historic themes, teach me about different cultures, and make me feel that I'm actually a part of the story.  With The Red Tent, Anita Diamant succeeds on all three levels.  I really felt like I was in the middle of this story with roots in the Old Testamant.<br /><br />The Red Tent is seen through the eyes of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and granddaughter of Isaac.  Jacob was a herdsman, and life was not easy during this period in history-especially for women.  But one thing the women of this story do have is the gift of sisterhood.  In this respect, their lives are rich.  And no where are their bonds as close as when they occupy the red tent-something done once a month (during menses) or during a childbirth.  Many may look upon the red tent as a confinement.  But the women look forward to their three days and three nights spent there each month.  They would gossip, share secrets, and pass along their stories to a younger generation.  They celebrated their gift of giving life and gave offerings for this gift to their gods.  They also assisted their fellow sisters in childbirth.  Jacob had four wives, so Dinah had many mothers to dote on her and teach her the secrets of being a woman.<br /><br />What I found fascinating about The Red Tent was the window it provided to a past culture.  We learn what they ate and what they drank, where they lived and how they dressed.  We also see the diseases they suffered from, how they died, and the gods they worshipped.  And since Dinah became a midwife, we get a glimpse of childbearing techniques.  We also see different areas as the characters travel from Iraq to Israel and finally Egypt.<br /><br />The Red Tent is a work of fiction, and should not be looked upon as an embellishment of the Bible.  Dinah is barely mentioned in the Bible, and the fictional Dinah tells us that it is up to daughters to tell their mother's stories.  The Red Tent is Diamant's vision of how Dinah's life could have played out.<br /><br />What made this book even more fascinating is that I also recently read Dan Brown's bestseller, The DaVinci Code.  While The Red Tent celebrates the feminine gifts of giving life (the sacred feminine), the premise of The DaVinci Code is how the early Christian leaders did everything in their power to suppress the sacred feminine.  While neither book should be taken as gospel, reading them so close together made for an interesting contrast.<br /><br />Diamant is a talented author, and I look forward to reading more of her works.<br /> <br />What made this book even more fascinating is that I also recently read Dan Brown's bestseller, The DaVinci Code.

It turns out that Dr. Geis liquidated all his assets over the course of the last year of his life.  Glory is left without very much money and her stepchildren accuse her of foul play.  So Glory begs McGee to find out what happened to the inheritance.  Of course, Travis discovers that the good doctor has more than a few skeletons in his closet, and there are a number of suspects.<br /><br />The plot in this 8th book is a little thin, and I figured out fairly early who the blackmailer was.  But I still gave One Fearful Yellow Eye four stars as the writing is sharp and crisp and as good as any previous McGee.  Two favorites include:<br /><br />\\"Take her home.  Boat her, beach her, bake her, brown her, and bunk her.  You too are a sucker for busted birds, starving kittens, broody broads.\\"<br /><br />or<br /><br />\\"There was no color in the world.  Gray sand, gray water, gray beach, gray sky.  I was trapped in one of those arty salon photographs of nature in the raw, the kind retired colonels enter in photography contests.\\"<br /><br />In terms of philosophizing, this book is MacDonald at his best.  Also, while I tend to like McGee better in his native Florida, Chicago is rather a good setting for him.<br /><br />This is my 8th Travis McGee and I'm a long way from being tired of him.  I'm anxious to start number nine-Pale Gray for Guilt.	2004-10-25

There are many books of pictures of the Romanov family, but Nicholas and Alexandra: The Family Albums by Prince Michael of Greece is probably the best of the bunch.  Since Nicholas became tsar and husband at almost the same time, their family life is very well documented in pictures.  There are the usual official photographs taken by professional photographers.  But the Romanov's were also big shutterbugs.  They all owned cameras and it is in these candid shots that we really get a chance to see life within the palace walls.  In addition to formal portraits, we see the Imperial Family at work, at play, on vacation and just relaxing. We also see extended family members (most of them European royalty from England, Sweden, Germany, Denmark and others).  Many of these photographs were taken from the albums of individual family members, and were hidden in communist archives.  They were only made available after perestroika.<br /><br />This book also gives us a glimpse of the many residences of the Romanov's.  While the Alexander Palace was their primary home, they also spent time in the Crimea (Livadia Palace), Spala (their hunting lodge in Poland), Standart and Polar Star (Imperial Yachts), and The Winter Palace in St. Petersburg.  Some of these photographs are of never before seen interior shots.<br /><br />Nicholas and Alexandra are criticized for being ineffective rulers, but in one thing they can't be faulted--they were loving and devoted parents.  The closeness of their family life comes through very clearly in The Family Albums.  There are also pictures of their captivity, that are extremely haunting.  But looking at this book just magnifies the tragedy of their fate.  They gave up not just palaces, jewels, clothes and priceless objects, but because of poor leadership, they also cost this beautiful family their lives.  That is the most heartbreaking loss of all.	2004-10-20

After thoroughly enjoying Jhumpa Lahiri's Pulitzer Prize-winner, Interpreter of Maladies, I was anxious to start her first full-length novel, Namesake.  This young and talented author has proven that her Pulitzer was not a fluke.<br /><br />The story begins in India.  Like most Bengali's, Ashoke and Ashima have an arranged marriage.  They move to America when Ashoke is offered a fellowship.  When he is eventually offered a professorship at MIT, they decide to try and make a life for themselves in this unfamiliar land.  Ashima gives birth to a son (Gogol) and a daughter (Sonia), and these first generation Americans embrace American food, customs and culture.  While not ashamed of their Bengali heritage, the children are more bored by the old ways.  Lahiri takes this story through their early adult years, and shows us how hard it is to straddle both cultures.<br /><br />Lahiri's book is so appealing in that she writes of universal themes.  First, she shows us how difficult it can be to make a life in a new homeland, and the guilt and problems resulting from first generation Americans who have a foot in both cultures.  Also, that love that grows from arranged marriages is often more enduring than marriages that are based on love.  And finally, how the values of our parents become more important as you get older-and sometimes when it is too late.  The importance of names is also a major theme in Namesake.  Sometimes, your acceptance of your name is the key to accepting yourself as a person.  There are themes that appeal to almost all of us.<br /><br />Lahiri's writing is fully satisfying, but not in a rich or overblown way (much like the many foods she describes in Namesake).  Her prose is graceful and elegant, but with a surprisingly simple style.  Lahiri has a way of looking into the heart and soul of her characters without a lot of excess.  Also, I found her characters haunting.  All in all, I hope that this fine author is already working on her next book.<br /> <br />	2004-10-18

After thoroughly enjoying Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible, I picked up her book, The Bean Trees.  While without the power and emotion of Poisonwood, The Bean Trees is a charming novel nonetheless.<br /><br />Taylor Greer comes from a small town in rural Kentucky.  Pittman is decades behind the rest of the country, and the only thing for teenage girls to do is to become pregnant.  Knowing she has to escape this environment, Taylor packs her things into a ramshackle car, and decides that she will travel until her car breaks down.  While on her journey, a Cherokee woman literally drops a baby into her car, and Taylor must now think of what's best not only for herself, but also this little girl.  She finally ends up in Tucson, and makes a life for herself there.<br /><br />Taylor is not brilliant, but she overflows with good old common sense.  She is also inquisitive and open minded-two traits that endear her to those around her.  Once she lands in Tucson, she is befriended by a number of people (who each possess as kind a heart as Taylor) and she creates a substitute family.  Also, while Taylor does not seem like a religious person, she is a spiritual one and can see God's presence all around here.<br /><br />While The Bean Trees does not have a riveting plot, it is very rich in imagery.  Kingsolver was a biologist before she became an author, and some of her descriptions are priceless.  I especially enjoyed the first rain in the desert, and the blooming of the night cereus.  So for a charming and heartwarming story, you can't go wrong with The Bean Trees.	2004-10-13

I started a love affair with European royalty while in junior high, and as luck or fate would have it, Robert Massie's Nicholas and Alexandra was published during this time.  I was bitten by the Romanov bug and have suffered from this malady ever since.<br /><br />Nicholas and Alexandra, the last Tsar and Tsarina of Imperial Russia, came from a distinguished royal pedigree.  Nicholas was the son of Tsar Alexander III, and his aunt was Princess Alexandra of Wales.  Alexandra was a Hessian princess and granddaughter of Queen Victoria.  As youngsters, they fell in love and \\"Nicky\\" knew that \\"Alix\\" was fated to be his bride.  Theirs was a true love match at a time when royal marriages were arranged for any reason but love.<br /><br />Two events conspired to cause the Romanov tragedy.  First, Nicholas was not a very strong-willed man.  He let others dominate him (including his wife).  When his father died suddenly at the age of 49, the young Nicholas was totally unprepared and untrained to be Ruler of all the Russia's. Second, Nicholas and Alexandra were very family oriented, and it was a crushing blow when their 5th child and only son was born with hemophilia.  In desperation, they alienated much of Russia (to protect this secret) and fell under the harmful influence of Rasputin.  Russia was ripe for revolution, and Nicholas and Alexandra were too blind to see what was happening in their own country until it was too late.<br /><br />Massie does a stellar job of bringing Russian history to life in a way that reads like a novel.  He also writes with a passion born of experience.  When his son was born with hemophilia, Massie started researching how hemophilia affected the royal houses of Europe-especially the Romanov's.  He details not just Russian history, but the history of this dreaded disease including various types of hemophilia, treatments, new advances, etc.  The only negative about this book is in the timing.  Massie wrote what was known in the late 1960's.  But since the fall of communism and perestroika, we now know so much more about what happened to the Imperial family.  Massie took this new information and finished the story in The Romanov's: The Final Chapter.  One book should not be read without the other.<br /><br />Nicholas and Alexandra is one of my favorite nonfiction books, and I find myself rereading it every five to six years or so.  I enjoy it just as much with each subsequent reading.  My original paperback was in such tatters that I finally treated myself to a new hardback copy.  Even after all these years, the tragic fate of the Romanov's continues to haunt us.But since the fall of communism and perestroika, we now know so much more about what happened to the Imperial family.

The Shaker Story by Flo Morse may not be a large book, but it provides a wealth of information about this little known and oft misunderstood religious group.  Some people confuse them with Quakers.  Others think they were simply manufacturers of furniture.  Morse sets out to fill in the gaps.<br /><br />The Shakers were founded in 1772 and thrived into the 1800's.  They believed that you didn't have to die to enter heaven.  Rather, heaven could be found right here on earth if you lived a simple and virtuous life.  Shakers were required to live in villages, where they were totally self-sufficient. Couples had to disavow marriage vows, and men, women and children lived apart from each other.  They did interact during worship where they sang and danced (or \\"shaked\\"). They produced seeds, herbs, hats, cloth, thread, brooms and furniture, and sold these items all over the country.  The Shakers were also prolific songwriters, and they composed over 30,000 hymns and songs.  Music was an important component of their worship.  Only one of their songs, A Simple Gift, has gone mainstream.  Aaron Copland included it as the main melody in his well-known classic, Appalachian Spring.<br /><br />You might wonder what would entice adults to live a celibate life. But this was often more appealing to women-rather than marrying an abusive or undependable husband.  Women had an equal say in village life, and some villages even welcomed blacks as equals.  Many unwanted children were dropped off at Shaker Villages, where they were raised to adulthood.<br /><br />The Shakers started to fade after the Civil War for a variety of reasons.  First, factories started mass-producing the same products the Shakers made by hand, but for a fraction of the cost.  Since members didn't procreate, new generations were not born to replace older generations as they died off.  And public orphanages meant less unwanted children coming to Shaker Villages.  One by one, the villages were dissolved and closed.  Several have become National Historic Sites, and it is fascinating to see how Shakers lived, worked and worshipped.  Still, there are a handful of Shakers in the United States (less than a dozen at last count), although the Shaker glory days appear to be over.<br /><br />So, if you can't visit a Shaker Village (such as Pleasant Valley Shaker Village in Kentucky), pick up Morse's book.  She provides a good look at this fascinating group.sed.  Several have become National Historic Sites, and it is fascinating to see how Shakers lived, worked and worshipped.

All of Pat Conroy's books have one foot in his childhood, and none is more autobiographical than The Great Santini.  Colonel Bull Meecham is a legendary Marine fighter pilot whose military successes are almost as many as his personal excesses.  Lillian Meecham is a Southern gentlewoman with a love of literature.  After moving from base to base each year, the Meecham's finally settle down in fictional Ravenel, SC (Beaufort in real life).<br /><br />The Colonel rules his fighter squadron and his family with an iron first.  While this technique is successful in motivating his pilots, it has disastrous effects on his wife and children.  His cruelty (both mental and physical) is enough to crush even the strongest soul.  While he chides Ben for being a sissy, he suppresses Ben's attempts to act like a man.  Yet, the Colonel can do endearing things, like when he gives Ben his original flight jacket on his 18th birthday.  No wonder Ben has a love-hate relationship with his old man.<br /><br />At a new school, Ben quickly establishes himself as a decent scholar and a talented basketball player.  Several teachers and his principal see the potential in young Ben, and give him the love and mentoring he could never get from the Colonel.  They teach him the importance of standing up for what he believes and to be his own man.  When one of Ben's friends is threatened, Ben defies his dad and goes to his aid.  In doing so, he becomes more of a man than his father will ever be.<br /><br />The Great Santini is a fabulous story, and nobody writes with as much passion and beauty as Pat Conroy.  Conroy takes us through the emotional gamut from belly laughs to tears and back again.  Although some parts of the story are fiction, there is enough truth in that when Conroy's mom filed for divorce from the real Colonel after 33 years of marriage, she handed a copy of The Great Santini to the judge as evidence of the Colonel's violent nature.  Conroy is a definitely success story and despite many scars, he was able to overcome his tumultuous upbringing to become the very successful writer he is.  But perhaps without that childhood, we would not know the Conroy we know today.  Even he admits that \\"one of the greatest gifts you can get as a writer is to be born into an unhappy family.\\"ite many scars, he was able to overcome his tumultuous upbringing to become the very successful writer he is.

What do a crooked party-animal lawyer, an African American drag queen, a wealthy homosexual antiques dealer, a piano player who knows 6000 songs, a Voodoo queen, and the Georgia bulldog mascot have in common?  They are all characters in John Berendt's record setting bestseller, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Never has a work of nonfiction been so informative and so much fun.  Not only are the characters eccentric, but the entire city of Savannah fits that description as well.  This beautiful, antebellum hothouse of the Old South is more a state of mind than a destination.  Savannahian's revere their history, worship their ancestors, are very status and race conscious, and love to party.<br /><br />Berendt spent eight years in Savannah and the first part of this book is more of a travelogue-introducing us to the history of Savannah and the quirky characters that will play a big part in the story later on.  I especially liked Berendt's comparisons of Savannah to her sister city, Charleston.<br /><br />The bulk of Midnight deals with a murder \\"mystery.\\"  Jim Williams (the antique dealer) lives in the stunning Mercer Mansion, and kills an employee in the house.  But was it murder or self-defense?  How the story unfolds is as fascinating as it is entertaining.  Midnight is definitely something that could only happen in Savannah.<br /><br />Midnight is a huge book, and it has had a major impact on this small city.  At first, many Savannahian's were aghast at \\"The Book\\" and especially, the way it portrayed their eccentricities.  But many residents came around as tourism skyrocketed (and increase of over 46%) as readers flocked to Savannah.  The Midnight Phenomenon has been a boon to the economy, and there are now tours, lectures, slide shows and even a gift shop based on The Book.  Even the Bird Girl statue that graces the cover had to be moved to the museum for safekeeping.<br /><br />I fell in love with Midnight when I first read it a number of years ago.  My husband and I also listened to the unabridged book on a long drive to Savannah, which made it even more enjoyable.  The movie version is an extremely poor and not very authentic adaptation of the book.

MacDonald's 7th book in the McGee series, Darker Than Amber.  McGee and his sidekick, Meyer, are minding their own business when a case is pretty much dropped in their laps.  As the two men are fishing while tied up to a bridge, a woman is thrown off the bridge and sinks right in front of them like a stone.  McGee dives overboard and is able to rescue the woman-despite the fact that her feet are wired to a cement block.  The woman, Vangie, turns out to be a high-priced prostitute who was involved in a scam gone bad.  It takes sometime, but McGee and Meyer are finally able to get the gist of Vangie's story, and they of course decide to help.<br /><br />MacDonald does his usual job of providing a great tale of mystery, murder and intrigue.  But one of the things I most enjoyed about Darker than Amber is that after having several cameo appearances in earlier books, we finally get to meet a fleshed-out Meyer.  McGee and Meyer perform a good Dr. Watson/Sherlock Holmes routine, and their camaraderie rivals many of the other detective-sidekick combinations including Spenser and Hawk, and Poirot and Captain Hastings.<br /><br />I am now 1/3 of the way through this 21 book series, and I have not been disappointed in a one.  In fact, MacDonald just gets stronger and stronger with each subsequent book.  It won't be long until I finish the entire series.	2004-10-08

For those who love reading about the Romanov's, Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia is one of the most beautiful and thrilling books available.  This book was originally compiled as the exhibition catalog for the prestigious Nicholas and Alexandra Exhibit put on by the Broughton Company in Wilmington, Delaware.  This 408 page tabletop book, is filled with incredible photos (most in color) of the close to 700 imperial items that were on display from the State Hermitage Museum and the State Archive of the Russian Federation.<br /><br />Nicholas and Alexandra contains fabulous paintings, letters, gowns, diaries, photos, icons, Faberge' eggs, frames, jewelry, dishes, sculptures, flags, uniforms, military decorations, weapons, porcelain, toys, and gifts given to the royal family.  It also includes a reproduction of Nicholas' library in the Winter Palace, as well as Tsarina Alexandra's grand piano, the throne from the Winter Palace and the coronation carriage originally designed for Empress Catherine II . The paintings of the royal wedding and Nicholas' coronation are especially impressive, while photos of items from their murder will leave you with a lump in your throat.<br /><br />While this book is short on giving any kind of in-depth history about the Romanov family, it goes a long way in showing just how they lived.  It's amazing to look at the dresses and uniforms and to realize that for positions larger than life, the Tsar and Tsarina were actually very small people.  Nicholas was a rather short man at approximately 5 feet 7 inches tall. More than anything, you get a glimpse of the tragedy of their fates and the things they gave up because of Nicholas' misguided leadership.  No wonder this story still haunts us--even after 87 years.	2004-10-05

I believe that in the United States, the most elegant, beautiful, gracious and historic city is Charleston, South Carolina.  Religion has always played a prominent role throughout Charleston's history, and The Preservation Society of Charleston has compiled a beautiful coffee-table book entitled The Churches of Charleston and the Low Country.<br /><br />I have heard that there are more Episcopal Churches per square mile in Charleston than in any other U.S. city.  While I'm not sure that this is true, it is evident that Charleston has a very large number of churches in various denominations.  In fact, because of her abundance of churches and the many steeples that grace her skyline, Charleston has been nicknamed The Holy City.<br /><br />Charleston has a fascinating religious history.  Although an English Colony with the Anglican Church being the official church, The Lord Proprietors enacted laws allowing for religious tolerance and the freedom to establish churches in other denominations.  Charleston's early tolerance was a model for the rest of the colonies, and many groups including French Huguenots, Quakers, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Roman Catholics and even Jews settled here.  Beth Elohim happens to be the oldest continuously operating synagogue in the nation.  The Churches of Charleston gives a thumbnail sketch of the history of 63 churches and synagogues established prior to 1900. It also includes beautiful photographs of church interiors and exteriors.  While many of the churches are in downtown Charleston, some are in the outlying low country including Edisto, Wadmalaw, Mt. Pleasant, Summerville, John's Island, Sullivan's Island, Rockville, and McClellanville. Some of the more prominent churches get several pages, while lesser-known buildings may get a page or less.<br /><br />For a prospective tourist or someone looking for a parish home in the Charleston area, this book is an excellent source for photographs and history.  It is also a lovely book to own if you are interested in Charleston, or like reading about historic churches.  If you want a real in-depth look at the history of religion in Charleston or the specifics of a historic church (such as St. Michael's or St. Philip's), there are better sources to be found.lso a lovely book to own if you are interested in Charleston, or like reading about historic churches.

Barbara Kingsolver's The Poisonwood Bible is the most rich, moving and powerful book I have read this year.  The Reverend Nathan Price is a Baptist minister from Georgia.  In 1959, he decides that there is no better place to sow the seeds of Christianity than the Congo.  He packs up his wife and four daughters, and they leave the segregated South for the Congolese jungles.  But like the garden seeds Reverend Price brings with him, the jungle is an inhospitable place for both American vegetables and Christianity.  Rather than adapt and adjust, Price becomes even more stubborn and arrogant in his determination to bend the Congo to his ways.<br /><br />The key to this story is Price's wife and four daughters, and each chapter is told through their eyes and each with their own voice.  The women are left to make most of the preparations for their trip, and they quickly learn that almost everything that they have packed is useless in the jungle.  But unlike the rigid Price, they learn to adjust in order to survive.  They are able to develop an appreciation for the beauty of the Congo.  They also make connections with the locals that the Reverend finds elusive.  In doing these things, they come to realize that the self-absorbed, unbending and all-knowing Price might not have all the answers after all.<br /><br />What makes this story even more fascinating is the political events that were happening in the Congo at this time.  The Congo was first a colony of Belgium, and whites exploited the Congolese for diamonds, rubber and cobalt.  In the middle of their stay, the Belgians give the Congo their independence, and things get very ugly as different groups struggle for control.  Even the American government gets involved in some very unsavory shenanigans in trying to influence the outcome.  It becomes a dangerous time for the Price family, and their very survival is at stake.<br /><br />The daughter's stories are lyrical and poignant, and their time in the Congo will affect each of the Price women in different ways--even long after they're gone.  Kingsolver's spellbinding words and memorable characters will also touch your heart and leave you thinking about this book long after you're done.affect each of the Price women in different ways--even long after they're gone.

I was reluctant to read The Lords of Discipline as I'm not much interested in books with military themes.  But I finally decided to read it as I love Pat Conroy and it takes place in my favorite of all cities, Charleston, SC.  Wow!  Not only was I blown away, but I also have a new book for my top ten list.<br /><br />Aspiring novelist and basketball player, Will McLean, finds himself a college student at the Carolina Military Institute (The Citadel--thinly disguised).  Will was not interested in the military, but he promises his dying father that he will attend his alma mater.  Will doesn't exactly excel in military studies, but he's a decent student, an athlete, and his professors and peers recognize him for his integrity and his sense of fairness.  Still, this is not an easy time to be a student in a military academy--especially in the South.  The Viet Nam War was raging, the military was unpopular and desegregation was knocking on the doors of Southern schools.  The Fourth Class system is brutal at best, and most cadets will look on their freshman year and Hell Night as living nightmares.  There are also rumors of a powerful and clandestine group of Institute students and alumni called The Ten.  While nothing has come forward to prove their existence, the possibility of such a group casts a cloud over the Corps of Cadets.<br /><br />Will and his roommates have survived the trials and tribulations of their underclassmen years.  But circumstances change very rapidly.  The first black student enrolls at the Institute and Will is asked to be a secret mentor to Cadet Tom Pearce.  It quickly becomes apparent that a group of cadets is trying to run Pearce out of the Institute.  Will steps in to intervene, and he discovers a truth so horrendous that this knowledge can bring down the Institute.  It also makes Will and his roommates targets.  Not only is their graduation now in jeopardy, but their lives are also in danger.<br /><br />Conroy is a master wordsmith, and I find myself reading his sentences over and over again.  It's comparable to taking a bite of a decadent dessert, and rolling it around on your tongue to savor every forkful.  His descriptions are priceless, his characters well fleshed out, and the plot will have you marathon reading to finish this 498-page book.  I especially loved his observations about Charleston and the low country.  Conroy also deals with timeless and universal issues.  They include the struggles of a young boy growing into manhood and how difficult it is to stand up for your beliefs.  Also, how those that love you can cause the worst hurt, and how those you think are loyal friends can betray you in a heartbeat.  Conroy dwells on how it is possible to love and hate something at the same time (in this case, the Institute), and how the righteous don't always prevail.  And while things might turn out in the end, they might not turn out the way you envision them.<br /><br />The one bad thing about Pat Conroy is that he is not one of those \\"serial\\" bestsellers who produce a book every year-whether they have anything to say or not.  While we often have to wait years between books, Conroy's works are definitely worth the wait.  Also, after reading The Lords of Discipline, I suggest picking up his nonfiction work, My Losing Season.  Detailing his senior year playing basketball for The Citadel, Conroy will reveal how much of The Lords of Discipline is autographical.I find myself reading his sentences over and over again.  It's comparable to taking a bite of a decadent dessert, and rolling it around on your tongue to savor every forkful.  His descriptions are priceless, his characters well fleshed out, and the plot will have you marathon reading to finish this 498-page book.  I especially loved his observations about Charleston and the low country.  Conroy also deals with timeless and universal issues.  They include the struggles of a young boy growing into manhood and how difficult it is to stand up for your beliefs.  Also, how those that love you can cause the worst hurt, and how those you think are loyal friends can betray you in a heartbeat.  Conroy dwells on how it is possible to love and hate something at the same time (in this case, the Institute), and how the righteous don't always prevail.  And while things might turn out in the end, they might not turn out the way you envision them. <br /> <br />The one bad thing about Pat Conroy is that he is not one of those \\"serial\\" bestsellers who produce a book every year-whether they have anything to say or not.  While we often have to wait years between books, Conroy's works are definitely worth the wait.  Also, after reading The Lords of Discipline, I suggest picking up his nonfiction work, My Losing Season.  Detailing his senior year playing basketball for The Citadel, Conroy will reveal how much of The Lords of Discipline is autographical. <br />	2004-09-27

In Pat Conroy's masterpiece, The Prince of Tides, not much is going right in Tom Wingo's life.  He drinks too much, has lost his teaching/coaching job, and his marriage is on the rocks.  He grew up with an abusive father whose violent behavior left physical and emotional scars on all the Wingo children.  His mother was more supportive, but was powerless to protect her children from her husband's wrath.  She also put her social ambitions before anything else in her life.  The only that has gone right in Tom's life is that he lived his entire life in the low country of Charleston, SC--one of the most beautiful and nurturing places on this earth.<br /><br />Things come to a head when Tom learns that his beautiful and talented twin, Savannah, has tried to commit suicide again.  As she lays comatose in a New York City mental hospital, Savannah's psychiatrist, Susan Lowenstein, urges Tom to travel to New York.  Doctor Lowenstein realizes that the only thing that can help save Savannah is to unlock the secrets of her terrible childhood (something that all the Wingo children have long suppressed and refuse to talk about).  Tom flies to New York reluctantly, and at first, presents Dr. Lowenstein with a façade made up of humor, sarcasm and even rudeness.  But Dr. Lowenstein eventually is able to break down Tom's protective shell to discover the horrors that took place during the Wingo's childhood.  She also realizes that in trying to save Savannah, that this might also be Tom's last chance to save himself.  But it turns out that Lowenstein has erected her own protective mask to hide her own unhappiness.  With a remote husband and a spoiled son, Tom is able to turn the tables and help the good doctor in promoting a little self-healing as well.<br /><br />The Prince of Tides is my favorite of all fiction books, and one of the most moving and emotional novels I have read.  I think Conroy is one of our best living authors, and his words seem more like music than the written word.  For those that know Conroy's background (including his own abusive father), it is disturbing to realize that much of this story is autobiographical in nature.  I watched the movie after reading the book, and while the movie was quite good (especially the actors including Barbra Streisand, Nick Nolte and Blythe Danner), the movie can't hold a candle to the novel.  Major storylines had to be left out and the plot greatly simplified.<br /><br />If you can only read one Conroy, make The Prince of Tides your choice.en word.

MacDonald has really hits his stride.  I have been reading this series in order, and each book gets better and better.<br /><br />As always, McGee jumps in to help a friend who was swindled of his $250,000 inheritance (we're talking 1960's here).  Arthur Wilkinson was scammed in a land deal by a crooked lawyer, a slick salesman, a brutal hoodlum, and even his own wife.  McGee, Wilkinson and Chookie (Wilkinson's former girlfriend) combine forces to discover how the scam operated and to try and recover some of the money.  Early on, we learn the identity of the bad guys, so there's no mystery here.  But how McGee infiltrates this group to investigate their modus operandi is MacDonald at his best.  When the situation suddenly goes out of control, you can't turn the pages fast enough.<br /><br />Bright Orange for the Shroud doesn't follow the formulae of his previous books in that McGee doesn't develop a love interest.  Also, there is less mayhem and murder, and more of the good guys are still alive at the end.  In some of MacDonald's books, McGee travels the country, but McGee is best when keeping to his native Florida.  His base of operation for this book is his own houseboat, The Busted Flush.<br /><br />I can't believe this series was never turned into a television series or a movie. With the resurgence of interest in MacDonald, perhaps it's not too late.	2004-09-21

Two of my favorite books are Tony Horwitz's Confederates in the Attic and Blue Latitutdes.  So I was anxious to read his earlier works.  One for the Road was actually published in 1987, but was re-released in 1999 after the success of his later books.  Twenty seven years old and freshly married to a girl from Australia, Horwitz decides to take a break from his newspaper job and follow a teenage fantasy to hitchhike through the Outback of Australia.<br /><br />The Outback is more desolate than you could even imagine.  Thousands of miles of highway snake through this barren area, and many of them are not even paved.  In many spots, livestock outnumber people by as much as 2000 to one.  The landscape has very few distinguishing characteristics save for the many abandoned cars and trucks that dot the roadway.  People who travel through Aboringinal areas need special permission.  And maps are totally undependable when it comes to landmarks in that rivers are dry, lakes are nonexistent, and towns may consist of a few houses, a petrol station and always a pub.  Even a large town sneaks up on Horwitz in that almost all the houses, hotels, shops and restaurants are burrowed underground.  Kangaroos, wombats and emus far outnumber cars, and a busy road might see three vehicles in a day.  Traveling becomes more an act of survival than a pleasant pastime.<br /><br />The Outback is made even more interesting by the people Horwitz meets.  A young couple with a baby travel 800 miles round trip every 2-3 weeks for supplies.  Young men give up their jobs to try their luck in the opal mines.  A Tasmanian family rides through on vacation.  A group of Japanese scientists are searching for a clearer view of Halley's Comet.  And ranchers and Aborginals abound.  The Outback is truly a melting pot, and Horwitz finds people from almost all parts of the glove. What ties all of them together are the pubs.  Very few of the inhabitants of the Outback will drive by a pub with out stopping for brew, and then stocking up more for the road.  Alcoholism is a major problem in Australia.<br /><br />Horwitz loves to travel and seems to have made it a career.  One for the Road is entertaining, but this book is a lightweight next to Confederates in the Attic (where he travels through the south) and Blue Latitudes (following the journeys of Captain Cook).  Still, for a person who will probably never travel to Australia, it's a fascinating look at a very remote area.  One for the Road also gives us a peak at the future of what this talented writer will become. And finally, as a young groom, it allowed Horwitz one last folly before settling down for good.or brew, and then stocking up more for the road.

But Chaz doesn't foresee two major problems that will develop because of this impulsive action.  First, Joey Perrone was a collegiate swimmer and she is able to survive her long ordeal at sea through skill, determination, and two lucky circumstances (including a floating bale of marijuana and a timely rescuer).  Second, Joey and her rescuer, Mick Stranahan, will stop at nothing to make Chaz pay for this misdeed, and he quickly discovers that his life is spiraling out of control.<br /><br />The characters in Skinny Dip are among Hiaason's best.  In addition to those mentioned above, there is Redneck Red Hummernut, a crooked farmer and polluter who pollutes the Everglades at will.  Earl \\"Tool\\" Toole is a drug dependent, Neanderthal of a bodyguard, who collects crosses from roadside memorials for his yard and actually has a tender spot in his heart.  Former governor, Skink, makes a cameo appearance.  Joey's brother, Corbett, has fled to New Zealand where he would rather raise sheep than deal with human beings.  And my favorite was former Minnesota native, detective Karl Rolvaag, who lives with two pythons and dreams of returning to a state where life is normal.  Rolvaag sees right through the very shallow Chaz, and sets out on a mission to solve this case before returning to Minnesota.<br /><br />While Skinny Dip is hysterically funny, all Hiaason's books have a sobering message.  Much of the action revolves around the Florida Everglades, and we learn how development, poachers, farmers and polluters are destroying this fragile eco-system. Sometimes, those that are hired to save the Everglades are actually contributing to its demise.<br /><br />So while some mystery writers might write more believable plots or less hokey characters, there is no writer today that writes more entertaining, hilariously funny novels as Hiaason.s more entertaining, hilariously funny novels as Hiaason.   <br />	2004-09-11

MacDonald's Travis McGee series.  In number 5, the gold in question is actually 28 ancient gold idols.  An old friend from McGee's murky past gives McGee a call asking for help.  Sam Taggart has disappeared for three years, and has been in some trouble. Taggart also has in his possession 28 gold idols from various ancient civilizations including Incan and Aztec cultures.  But before McGee can render any assistance, Taggart is brutally murdered and all but one of the idols goes missing.<br /><br />McGee goes on a quest to discover not only who killed his friend, but also to unearth the mystery of Taggart's 3 missing years.  He also looks for the stolen idols.  He gets assistance from Taggart's former fianc&eacute;e, Nora, and this case takes him from Florida to Mexico and then to Los Angeles.<br /><br />While I really enjoyed MacDonald's first four books, I found A Deadly Shade of Gold harder to read.  This novel is double the length of his first four books and I wonder if MacDonald was experiencing some growing pains in trying to expand on this series.  I found the plot extremely cumbersome in spots.  It definitely lost momentum about two thirds of the way through.  Also, it was hard to keep track of the many characters, and I found the Cuban connection a little confusing.  Still, I would not discount MacDonald and will continue to read the rest of this series (21 books in all).  His mastery of observation is nothing short of brilliant.	2004-09-04

David Hackett Fischer's Washington's Crossing is an amazingly, well-written story about this pivotal event.  In scope and number, The Battle of Trenton does not seem impressive.  It lasted but two hours and the combined American and Hessian forces totaled less than 5000 men.  But in our fight for independence, it was a huge event for three reasons.  First, American forces weren't having much success and a loss at Trenton would have probably meant the end of our fight for independence.  Second, beating one of the best armies in the world gave the Americans a much needed psychological boost.  And third, this victory made the rest of the world (especially France) take notice that maybe this ragtag bunch of soldiers meant business and were worth backing.<br /><br />Normally, when I read a book about the military or about wars, my eyes glaze over.  But Fischer provides a riveting tale that kept my interest despite military strategies, battles, weapons and the like.  The first 200 pages explain the events leading up to the Battle of Trenton, including the arrival of British and Hessian troops in 1776, The Battle of New York, and the retreat of the American army through New Jersey.  He then details Washington's Crossing on Christmas night, The Battle of Trenton, The Second Battle of Trenton, The Battle of Princeton and The Forage War in early 1777.<br /><br />What makes Washington's Crossing so engrossing are the many tidbits, trivia and information Fischer provides.  He explains the difference between British, Hessian and American troops in terms of training, experience, education, uniforms and weapons.  He also gives us insight into how it was possible for the upstart Americans to beat two of the best armies in the world.  We learn that many British commanders (including Lord Cornwallis, General William Howe and Admiral Richard Howe) were sympathetic to the American cause, although they drew the line at independence.  Americans look on Cornwallis as a loser, but he is revered in England and Ireland for his many accomplishments both before and after the Revolution.  We also hear how when soldiers were leaving the army in droves because their enlistments were up, Thomas Paine wrote a disturbing series of articles called The Crisis (\\"These are the times that try men's souls.)\\"  These articles stirred enough passion for the fight to cause soldiers to re-enlist and civilians to sign-up.  He also puts to rest many myths including the one that Hessian troops were drunk on Christmas night.<br /><br />What makes Washington's Crossing even more timely for me is that many of the events leading up to The Battle of Trenton took place within 20 miles of my home.  Four Delaware crossings were actually planned for that fateful Christmas.  One of them left from Dunk's Ferry (which would have landed in my hometown of Beverly), but was unsuccessful due to hazardous river conditions.<br /><br />Washington's Crossing wasn't exactly a light summer read, but it was an amazing and fascinating story.  I hated to see it end.  While not an autobiography, this book ranks right up there were other recent books dealing with this period including McCullough's John Adams, Isaacson's Ben Franklin and Chernow's Alexander Hamilton.nd Admiral Richard Howe) were sympathetic to the American cause, although they drew the line at independence.

Needing money for her rent, Stephanie picks up what she thinks will be an easy apprehension.  Maxine Nowicki, a waitress at a local diner, has gone missing.  She has jumped bail after being arrested for stealing her boyfriend's car.  But not only has Maxine disappeared off the face of the earth (or at least Trenton, NJ), everyone who might have knowledge of her whereabouts has either shown up maimed, missing or even dead.  Of course, things are much more complicated than they first appear and Stephanie ends up having to solve a mystery or two before she can find Maxine.<br /><br />What makes Janet Evanovich's books so much fun are the regular, recurring characters.  Grandma Mazur is always armed and ready to assist.  Lula is now working for Vinnie in the bond business, and owns her own stun gun (don't get her mad).  Cop and friend Joe Morelli is very much in the picture.  However, the dangerous and mysterious Ranger (fellow bounty hunter and mentor) is becoming more tempting as a romantic interest.  And Joyce Bernhardt (another bounty hunter and Stephanie's archenemy) always has her nose where it doesn't belong.  Stephanie also seeks help from a new character, cross-dresser Salvatore (Sally) Sweet.  Sally alone makes the book worth reading.  Evanovich also has Stephanie branch out a little bit, and the scene where Stephanie and her entourage go to the Atlantic City casinos is really a hoot!<br /><br />Each Evanovich book gets better than the last, and I think that the Stephanie Plum series is the funniest and most entertaining mystery series out there. I first read this book, and then listened to it on tape during a trip.  It was just as funny the second time around, and the audio version should come with a warning: \\"This tape may cause the driver to become distracted due to laughing\\"	2004-08-17

If you are looking for a fun and entertaining beach book (especially about the low country beaches of South Carolina), Dorothea Benton Frank's Isle of Palms is just the book.  Having previously written Sullivan's Island and Plantation, Frank's third book is her best effort yet.<br /><br />Summer is coming and 37-year-old Anna Lutz Abbot decides that it is time to take control of her life.  Three traumatic events occurred during Anna's childhood, and she has pretty much lived her life as a victim.  A divorcee' raising an 18 year old daughter, Anna decides to buy a house, make a career change and find a romantic interest.  A terrible wrong in her life must also be righted.  Things don't always develop as Anna expects, but sometimes the surprises are the most rewarding.<br /><br />What makes Frank's books so much fun are the sassy writing, witty dialogue, and colorful characters.  Frank's descriptions are hysterical.  At one point, she tells us the difference between Southern gentlemen, bubbas and red necks-something that only a person raised in the South could do without offense.  Her characters are especially memorable from gay ex-husband Jim, to Lucy the intellectually challenged and surgically altered bombshell neighbor to beautiful daughter Emily, who comes home from college in Gothic attire.<br /><br />On the minus side, this story is a bit unbelievable in parts.  Anna doesn't quite deal with issues involving both parents and her childhood.  Also, the book is written entirely in the first person. Most of the chapters are seen through Anna's eyes, but several are told by the nosy neighbor, Miss Mavis.  At the start of a new chapter, it was sometimes confusing to figure out who was speaking.<br /><br />But negatives aside, Isle of Palms is an entertaining read.  It was especially timely as I actually read it on a South Carolina beach, and am familiar with many of the sights Frank mentions.  Her latest book, Shem Creek, has just been published.

It is about time that someone set the record straight about Alexander Hamilton, and Ron Chernow does an impressive job in his new biography, Alexander Hamilton.  This is no easy task as Hamilton is the most complex and contradictory of men.  He possessed a brilliant mind, but often lacked common sense.  He was arrogant and unrelenting with his enemies, but had a kind and romantic heart for loved ones.  He was accused of being aristocratic, yet never had much wealth and was a staunch abolitionist.  He was loved and revered by the Federalists, but hated by the Republicans.  He had numerous successes, yet brought about the end of his own political ambitions and the Federalist Party by his own hand.  This was mostly caused by his major inferiority complex and his very thin skin.  Hamilton was also a prolific writer, and any biographer is faced with the task of wading through thousands and thousands of letters, drafts, pamphlets, articles and other documents.  No wonder Hamilton has remained the most unknown and under appreciated of our founding fathers.<br /><br />Chernow starts with Hamilton's tragic childhood, which provided a shaky emotional foundation for this giant of a man.  He was born out of wedlock in The British West Indies.  By the time he was a young teenager, his father deserted the family and his mother, grandmother and uncle all died.  The father of a friend saw great potential in the young Hamilton, and paid to send him to the colonies.  This act of generosity changed his fate forever.<br /><br />Hamilton enrolled in King's College (now Columbia) just on the verge of the Revolutionary War.  He was quickly drawn to the Patriot side. He enlisted in the military and rose through the ranks to become General Washington's aide-de-camp.  Hamilton wanted a command of his own, but Washington was reluctant to part with his valuable aide.  But he did give Hamilton a command at the Battle of Yorktown, and his troops performed admirably.<br /><br />But it was after the war that Hamilton really distinguished himself.  He was the main catalyst in the formation of what became the Second Continental Congress.  When the states appeared reluctant to adopt the new Constitution, Hamilton responded with his wordy but powerful Federalist Papers, which helped sway the vote for this important document. Hamilton was the most brilliant as the nation's first Secretary of the Treasury.  He had a blank slate to work with and when he assumed this position, the US was pretty much bankrupt.  He single-handedly set financial policies and the course of capitalism for this new country.  He established the treasury, set up the US Bank, arranged for foreign loans, created the Coast Guard, set up a tax system, established a customs service, encouraged the role of manufacturing with help from the government, etc.  He also arranged for the federal government to assume the state debt from the Revolution and pushed for a standing army and navy.  In some ways he was ahead of his time.  He advocated the establishment of government inspections for American goods (something not done until T. Roosevelt's administration) and also lobbied for the creation of military academies, military hospitals and a veterans administration.<br /><br />Despite Hamilton's many successes, he wasn't without his very vocal critics.  Republicans (especially those from the south) did not trust bankers and banks, and were clueless about finances.  They loathed Hamilton and accused him of financial improprieties.  They were also jealous of his relationship under President Washington.  Thomas Jefferson was often at the center of these attacks, and his treatment of Hamilton was downright disgraceful.  In some instances, Hamilton didn't help his own cause.  He was a flirt and a ladies man and when he had an affair with a married woman, he was blackmailed by the women's husband.  When the affair became public knowledge, it detracted from his public persona and probably cost him his chance of becoming president.  He would not compromise and when he felt insulted and or threatened, he often times said or wrote too much in anger, when it would have been more beneficial for him to keep quiet.  He was constantly challenging men to duels when they spoke against him, but friends were able to intercede and extract apologies from those showing offense.  Ironically, the duel with Aaron Burr (that killed him) was the first where he had been challenged.<br /><br />Still, Hamilton was a fascinating man and probably the most brilliant in the establishment of our new nation. As Chernow states, \\"If Washington was the father of the country and Madison the father of the Constitution, then Alexander Hamilton was surely the father of the American government.\\"  With the many biographies of our founding fathers that have been printed recently (including John Adams and Ben Franklin), Alexander Hamilton (the man and the book) towers above the others.m his chance of becoming president.

MacDonald's Travis McGee series is like eating potato chips:  you can't eat just one.  But unlike potato chips, each book tastes better than the last.  In The Quick Red Fox, the 4th book in this series, MacDonald really hits his stride.<br /><br />Film-star Lysa Dean calls in McGee on a top secret and very sensitive job.  Dean was at a party with nine other people when some compromising pictures were taken.  The actress has been blackmailed once over these photos, and a year after the original blackmail scheme, she receives more photos and a threatening letter.  Afraid that the release of these pictures will jeopardize her film career and interfere with her planned marriage to husband number five, she asks McGee to investigate.  She also gives McGee her young, beautiful and efficient, but very frosty personal assistant, Dana Holtzer.<br /><br />McGee and Holtzer crisscross the country trying to interview the other members from that fateful party.  Some are scarred, some are missing and some are mysteriously murdered.  But despite all the odds and lots of dead ends, McGee is able to assemble the pieces of this intriguing puzzle.<br /><br />The Travis McGee series continues to get better and this was the best one yet.

A Purple Place for Dying is the third book in John MacDonald's Travis McGee series, and McGee comes upon his most troubling case yet.  McGee is brought to the Midwest by a big, brassy, bossy Blonde who needs help.  Mona Yeoman suspects that her husband has pilfered her trust fund, and she wants a divorce.  McGee's job is to find out what happened to the money.  McGee doesn't particularly like Yeoman, but is tempted to take the case because he needs the money.  But before he even has a chance to say yes, Mona is murdered right in front of his eyes, and this changes everything.  What makes things even more mysterious is that her body disappears when the police are called to the scene of the crime.<br /><br />McGee could simply take his return plane ticket and fly home to his native Florida.  But for whatever reasons, he decides to stick around and do some snooping.  There are many twists and turns and also a few more mysterious murders.  As usual, McGee finds himself in danger the closer he comes to the truth.  And the truth comes as a complete surprise.<br /><br />Each MacDonald book gets better than the previous one.  We also get to see McGee become more fleshed out as a character.  Still, it seems that the early books in this series are more of a novella length, but MacDonald corrects this with later books.<br /><br />Overall, the McGee series is a true gem, and I'm glad to have discovered these wonderful mysteries.	2004-07-28

I'm an avid reader of mysteries and I thought I had a basic knowledge of all the prolific writers (even though I haven't sampled all their works).  But when a friend recommended John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series, it wasn't even on my radar screen.  I started this series with the first book, The Deep Blue Good-By, and was completely blown away!<br /><br />Travis McGee is a combination of a Mickey Spillane and a Dashiell Hammett character.  McGee is a beach bum who lives on the houseboat, cruises chicks, enjoys the good life, and does as little work as possible.  When the money runs out, he acts as a modern day Robin Hood-helping those who have been swindled recover their losses (for a percentage, or course).  But what makes McGee so much fun is that he is a lovable rake with an astute sense of the world and the people around him, which sometimes borders on brilliance.  Having attending the University of Pennsylvania, Syracuse and Harvard, MacDonald is no slouch, either.  Some of McGee's musings include:<br /><br />\\"A woman who does not guard and treasure herself cannot be of much value to anyone else.  They become a pretty little convenience, like a guest towel.\\"<br /><br />and<br /><br />\\"A man with a credit card is in hock to his own image of himself.\\"<br /><br />The plot is fast paced, and will keep you turning pages as quickly as possible.  And while McGee seems to solve at least part of the mystery, the ending isn't entirely happy.  The Deep Blue Good-By is definitely a book with an edge.  While written in the early 1960's, this story could have been written today except for the absence of cell phones and computers.<br /><br />The only reason I gave The Deep Blue Good-By four stars instead of five is that at 144 pages, it is just a little light.  But I am happy to have discovered this entertaining series, and have already started the second book, Nightmare in Pink.	2004-07-24

Nightmare in Pink is my second Travis McGee (and the second in the series), and it is even more riveting than the first.<br /><br />McGee gets a call from an old war buddy who is in a VA hospital.  Mike Gibson is blind and disabled, and when he asks McGee to check something out for him, McGee acquiesces-mostly out of guilt.  Mike's beautiful and younger sister, Nina, is engaged to be married when her fianc&eacute; is mysteriously killed in a mugging. While cleaning out his things, Nina discovered $10,000 (we're talking 1960's here) and thinks he was in on something shady.  The police haven't been able to solve the mugging and they haven't been told about the money, so McGee agrees to snoop around.  Unfortunately, the case is in New York City and this Florida boat-bum is literally a fish out of water.<br /><br />Mike and Nina quickly join forces (in more ways than one) and uncover a complicated financial scam to rob the fianc&eacute;'s former boss of millions.  Of course, the closer they get to solving the crime, the more they expose themselves to danger.  At one point, McGee is even drugged, kidnapped, and held against his will in a mental hospital, where he is subjected to experimental hallucinogens.  How he escapes will have you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />McGee again continues with many profound observations.  One that I especially liked is \\"A good listener is far more rare than an adequate lover.\\"<br /><br />Nightmare in Pink had only two drawbacks that I could see.  As with The Deep Blue Good-By, this book is a bit light at 143 pages.  Also, while the plot was riveting, it was also unbelievable in spots.  But John D. MacDonald has a new fan, and I have A Purple Place for Dying up next.	2004-07-24

After reading Dan Brown's Angels and Demons and The Digital Fortress, I was anxious to read the best-selling DaVinci Code.  Although it was fast and entertaining, it was not without some flaws.<br />DaVinci Code combines the religious theme of Angels and Demons with the cryptography theme of The Digital Fortress.  Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon (of Angels and Demons) is called in by the French police when the curator of the Louvre of found murdered.  Before the curator dies, he leaves several cryptic messages and arranges his body in a symbolic pose.  Cryptographer Sophie Neveu shows up at the scene, and she quickly informs Langdon that he is their chief suspect.  Neveu is also the granddaughter of the victim.  They set out on a whirlwind adventure to solve the murder on their own.<br />Three other men are also found murdered the same night, and it is discovered that all four victims belonged to a secret society, The Priory of Sion.  Robert and Sophie's search leads them to such topics as the beginning of Christianity, the role of Mary Magdalene, the Knights Templar, Opus Dei, Pagan Worship, and the search for the Holy Grail.  But what was a big disappointment is that The DaVinci Code is filled with a large number of historical inaccuracies.  Even a novice will know that Prince Charles and Princess Diana were married at St. Paul's, and not Westminster.  The plot is also unbelievable in spots, although the plot for Angels and Demons was more of a stretch.<br />Still, I listened to the unabridged DaVinci Code on a long trip, and reader Paul Michael did a stellar job of bringing this story to life.  I thought his accents were especially good.<br />So, accept this book for what it is-an entertaining work of fiction, but not a definitive historic research.	2004-07-20

South Carolina by Henry Leifermann is one of a series of Compass American Guides.  Each state is written by a different author, and South Carolina is not only the best of them all, but also one of the most informative and concise guides ever written.<br />South Carolina is a diverse and beautiful state, and few states can boast that they begin at the Atlantic Ocean and end at the mountains.  The author first provides us with a crash course in history from the geology of South Carolina, to the Colonial Era, the Revolution, the Antebellum Era, The Civil War and through to race relations and the diverse population that makes up this state.  Leifermann also includes chapters on the Sea Islands, Charleston, Coastal Plantations, Myrtle Beach and Grand Strand, Coastal Plain, Piedmont, and the Blue Ridge.  In addition to maps, timelines, paintings, and drawings, all the chapters include wonderful photography by Eric Horan.<br />This book is also packed full of pertinent information such as facts about the climate, the economy, the population, and specifics (state bird, state flower, etc.).  It also provides the reader with practical information such as bed and breakfasts, hotel chains, restaurants, historic sites, festivals and events, museums, parks and forests, tours, golf courses, and places to get tourist information. It even includes a recipe or two.<br />So, if you're planning a trip to South Carolina, forget the AAA Tourbook and pick up Leifermann's book instead.  You won't be disappointed.	2004-07-10

Pat Conroy is my favorite author, and after reading everything else that he has written, I decided to pick up a copy of The Boo.  The Boo is Conroy's first book, and the only way he got it published was to publish it himself.<br />The story started when Conroy was fresh out of The Citadel and still wet behind the ears.  He discovered that the beloved Thomas Nugent \\"The Boo\\" Courvoisie, Commandant of Cadets at The Citadel, was fired from his job.  At The Citadel, the Boo could best be described as a character--calling all of his cadets \\"lambs\\" and himself The Good Shepherd.  If you were naughty, you were a bum, and if not, you were called Bubba.  While meting out discipline and demerits, the Boo proved to be a father figure to most of the cadets and tried to make this military college a little more palatable.<br />The Boo is actually a collection of short stories, anecdotes, letters, cartoons and photographs.  And it's not just about The Boo, but The Citadel and the Corps of Cadets as well.  Many of them are hysterical, but not all endings were happy at The Citadel.  The Fourth Class System could be brutal (and even fatal) for those who were weak or couldn't survive.  This book also includes a glossary to help the reader keep track of those military terms Conroy throws around such as brace, rack, pop-off, shako, plebe, knob, etc.  Some of the definitions are a hoot including:<br />Clemson-a cow pasture in the upper part of the state<br />VMI-a school burned by the Yankees during the Civil War and unfortunately rebuilt soon afterwards<br />Why this book is so great for a Conroy fan is that it gives the reader a peak at the writer Conroy would later become.  The Citadel was not a nurturing environment for aspiring writers, although Conroy did have a few mentors there.  The Boo gave Conroy a voice, and even he admits that this book is \\"The Lords of Discipline in embryo,\\" which became his first best-selling novel.  In the movie version of The Lords of Discipline, the character of Boo (called Bear in the movie) is wonderfully played by Robert Prosky.<br />Since Conroy became a famous author, The Boo has been re-released, and he even writes a new introduction.  So for Conroy diehards, The Boo is an absolute must.  While it is not great literature and doesn't quite measure up to his later and more famous work, it does provide us with a picture of where this talented author has come from.character of Boo (called Bear in the movie) is wonderfully played by Robert Prosky. <br />Since Conroy became a famous author, The Boo has been re-released, and he even writes a new introduction.

I picked up Lois Battle's Storyville because of my love of New Orleans and my fascination with its history.  Unfortunately, this book did not live up to expectations.<br />Storyville was the Red Light District in New Orleans-legal from 1898 until 1917.  This story bounces between the lives of the denizens of The District, and those of an upper-crust family, the Ransome's.  Their lives intersect when the Ransome's son falls in love with a prostitute, which causes a \\"downward spiral of events\\" that will change all their lives forever.<br />Storyville starts off with great promise, and Battle makes a good effort to develop her characters.  But halfway through, the characters seem to get bogged down in the plot, and the ending is especially weak and unbelievable.  Also, many of the characters are unlikable from the beginning, but even those that I originally liked became loathsome by the end.<br />This book does offer a few redeeming tidbits.  The characters who work in Storyville are quite colorful, and the description of a meeting of the madams of The District (including one drag queen) is quite entertaining.  The book touches on such topics (however lightly) as the suffrage movement, the Spanish American War, the building of the Panama Canal and even some background on the Civil War.  There are a few morsels of history about New Orleans and The District that are interesting and informative, but there aren't enough of them.<br />So, if you're really interested in reading about Storyville, there are much better books to be had.	2004-07-01

Lalita Tademy has woven together a moving and heartwarming tale in her first novel, Cane River.  Chosen for Oprah's Book Club, Tademy uses the skeleton of her family tree as the basis for this fascinating work of historical fiction.  The author had personal knowledge as far back as her great-grandmother, who was born into slavery.  She gave up a lucrative job to search out her family genealogy, which took two years to research and led to the writing of this book.<br />Tademy was able to document as far back as Elizabeth, a kitchen slave who was sold from Virginia to Rosedew Plantation on the Cane River in Louisiana.  The book traces the lives of Elizabeth and her daughter, granddaughter, and great-granddaughter (Suzette, Philomene and Emily).  All four women were born into slavery, and all had children by white plantation owners (whether by force or by choice).  They each had enough intelligence and enough drive to make sure that these men provided a better life for both themselves and their children.  Each generation benefited in a different way from not having to work the fields to better living arrangements to education for their children and even the deeding of 163 acres of land.  These four women also had the strength to keep their family together despite difficult times, and to even help them thrive into the 20th Century.<br />But along with the successes, this is also a tale of heartache and tragedy.  Slavery was never easy, no matter what the circumstances.  Many times, a plantation owner would die and his slave families split up and sold to settle the estate.  One happy slave couple were allowed to marry, only to have the husband sold up North because the executor of the estate wanted the wife to himself.  Yellow fever, pneumonia, other diseases and childbirth claimed many lives.  As each generation got lighter and lighter in complexion, there was the temptation to sever family ties and move to another part of the country so that they could pass as white (as one son actually did).  After the Civil War, Emily lived in a common-law marriage with a Frenchman, building a house, running a store, and raising 5 children.  When their house, their store and their lives were threatened by local whites, they were forced to separate.  The Frenchman married a white woman, and the results were tragic.  And despite the Civil War, blacks still had very few rights.  When the Frenchman wanted to leave his estate to his mixed children (the only ones he had), they were denied because they were illegitimate.  Of course they were illegitimate-it was illegal for mixed couples to marry.<br />Tademy's research provides the reader with much to enrich this book including photos, drawings, maps, newspaper articles, wills, personal letters, tax records, and census lists.  And although it is sometimes difficult to keep everyone straight in this story (a major problem with a book that spans 137 years and multiple generations), Tademy also provides us with a family tree to help.<br />So if you're looking for good historic fiction or even a book to share with a book group, Cane River is an excellent choice. I would love to see Tademy continue this story in another book.te (as one son actually did).

Although a book about the plague in 17th century England, this is not just a story about disease and death, but also a moving tale about survival, passion, compassion and unlikely heroes.<br />Based on a true story, this historical novel weaves a fabulous and heartwarming tale about how one small town in Derbyshire dealt with the plague.  Year of Wonders is told through the eyes of a lowly and uneducated peasant girl named Anna Frith.  Anna is a young widow with two young sons.  She goes to work for the Anglican rector and his wife, Michael and Elinor Mompellion.  Elinor takes Anna under her wing, and becomes not just a teacher and mentor, but also a friend.  The town is thrown into chaos when it is discovered that the plague has struck.  Rector Mompellion convinces the town that they must close their borders and that all residents must stay (to prevent it spreading to other villages).  He also offers a promise that no one will suffer alone, and he convinces the earl from a neighboring town to provide food and other necessities.  What follows is a tale of tragedy and triumph.  The plague lasted over a year, and two thirds of the townspeople perished.  Mompellion, Elinor and Anna take on the task of ministering to the town in ways that are heroic.  They find themselves battling not only this dreaded disease, but also superstition, greed, and even murder.  And despite their own tragedies, they discover that their efforts make them stronger and that they have more courage than they thought possible.<br />Brooks' writing is truly elegant, and Anna's thoughts and words are written in the lyrical but simple cadence of the 1660's.  Anna describes her husband; \\"his hands were big, cracked things with broken, blackened nails, and his idea of lovemaking was a swift and sweaty tumble, a spasm and then sleep.\\"  I just couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  There is also much historical research including not only the plague itself, but also of the living conditions in a small English village during the 17th Century.<br />While this is Geraldine Brooks' first novel, she has two nonfiction books to her credit including Nine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic Women.  I will definitely be reading more of this talented author.ened nails, and his idea of lovemaking was a swift and sweaty tumble, a spasm and then sleep.\\"  I just couldn't turn the pages fast enough.

So I was anxious to start The Escape of Alexei by Vadim Petrov, Igor Lysenko and Georgy Egorov.  Those looking to this book for a Romanov-fix won't find it here.<br />The premise that someone could have survived the Romanov massacre in Ekaterinburg in July 1918 is a tempting one.  It gained even more momentum when two bodies turned up missing when the remains of the Royal Family were found in 1978.  The group chosen to kill the Romanovs was a disorganized bunch, and the scene of the murder was complete chaos.  But the theory that Vasily Filatov was actually the tsarevich Alexei is a laughable one.<br />First and foremost, there has been no DNA testing, and the authors give us lame excuses why this has not been done.  We've already been duped by Anna Anderson, who was proven by DNA to be an impostor after her death.  Second, the fact that a hemophiliac could live to the ripe old age of 83 stretches the imagination-especially without medical intervention.  The book does have good photos, but the young Alexei looks nothing like Filatov.  There are many statements made by Filatov's family, but just because Filatov loved the celebrate New Years' and birthdays, read poetry, or played classical music doesn't prove he was Alexei.  Filatov also didn't seem to pass on much concrete information about growing up as the tsarevich.  There are just too many gaps in the story, and too much lacking here.<br />The book itself is tedious at times-especially the background information at the beginning.  The body of the book is only 176 pages, and much of it is repetition.  And the 26 page appendix is filled with worthless information.<br />So, for true Romanov aficionados, I suggest you pass on The Escape of Alexei and pick up something a little more worthwhile.	2004-06-18

Tony Horwitz has had two back-to-back smash hits in his Pulitzer prize-winner Baghdad Without a Map and the critically acclaimed Confederates in the Attic.  He now has added another gem to his body of work in Blue Latitudes:  Boldly Going Where Captain Cook Has Gone Before.<br />James Cook seems largely to be forgotten to history.  Yet, his was probably the most incredible voyage of discovery.  Just the story of how Cook came to be a navigator is a fascinating one.  In a day where the children of laborers did not receive an education, a mentor took notice of Cook and paid for four years of school.  Cook was ambitious and worked hard to fill in the gaps in his education.  As a teen, he moved from a store clerk to working on a coal ship to finally joining the Royal Navy, where he rose very rapidly through the ranks.<br />The tales of Cook's three voyages to the Pacific are an unbelievable story.  This man of humble beginnings became one of the world's greatest explorers.  In the course of 10 years, his Pacific travels covered over 200,000 miles at a time when one third of the world was unknown and unmapped.  He traveled \\"140 of the earth's 180 degrees latitude, as well as its entire longitude.\\"  He probably named more places (rivers, islands, points, bays, bluffs, etc.) than any other man, before or since.  He was a shrewd handler of men--both those above and below him in rank.  He was a prolific writer of journals and logs, which are still read today.  Cook was also a brilliant surveyor and chart maker, and his map of New Zealand was used up until the 1990's (when it was finally replaced by satellite images).  His voyages also led to the discovery of thousands of new plants and animals, and his claiming land for Britain helped to eventually lead Britain in becoming a major empire that spanned 11 thousand miles.<br />But what makes Blue Latitudes a true delight is Horwitz's travelogue.  In his attempt to follow in Cook's footsteps and see locations as Cook might have seen them, Horwitz travels to Canada, Tahiti, Bora-Bora, New Zealand, Australia, Niue, Tonga, England, Alaska and Hawaii.  With his sidekick Roger, his travels are often hysterical.  His week spent on a replica of the Endeavour (complete with 14 inches of hammock space) is especially a hoot.  But it is also depressing to discover that the European explorers (not just Cook) changed the way of life on these islands.  Many brought with them disease, STD's, materialism and religion.  They also tried to eradicate the native culture and native populations.  Horwitz also discovered that while Cook is revered in England, he is pretty much reviled among the Pacific nations he visited.  Yet ironically, journals, diaries, logs and sketches from Cook's travels are  in some cases the only record of these native cultures.  It was also distressing to Horwitz was to discover that very little actually exists from Cook's time.  Places he lived, worshipped and worked are pretty much gone.  The sites he visited are also much changed.  Cliff Thornton, president of the Captain Cook Society told Horwitz that \\"the best you can do is catch an echo of the man.  You can almost never reach out and touch him.\\"<br />The only thing lacking from this almost perfect book is pictures.  There are plenty of maps and a painting of Cook.  It would have been fascinating to see photos of the many places Horwitz traveled.  I don't expect to be traveling to Bora-Bora, Tonga, Niue, Tahiti, or the other locations mentioned any time soon.  Still, Blue Latitudes is a wonderful book and even those not much interested in history will find a fascinating  story here.e seen them, Horwitz travels to Canada, Tahiti, Bora-Bora, New Zealand, Australia, Niue, Tonga, England, Alaska and Hawaii.

This book certainly provides the reader with a wild ride!  While I liked the history in Angels and Demons, I thought the plot was less hokey in Digital Fortress.  It also provides a fascinating look inside the National Security Agency.  The NSA is more secretive than the CIA and FBI.  The NSA is responsible for gathering global electronic intelligence data, which can come from within our own country, other countries, or even from groups (such as terrorist organizations).  Much of the communication that the NSA monitors is encrypted, and Digital Fortress gives us a peak at the job of a cryptographer, or code breaker.<br />We are introduced to NSA head cryptographer and her boss, Susan Fletcher and Trevor Strathmore.  Their job is made much easier by the use of a top-secret, billion dollar computer called TRANSLTR.  But there is always the threat of a code that can't be broken, and when TRANSLTR takes more than 15 hours and still can't crack a code (most codes take less than an hour), the possibility of such a dangerous situation becomes a reality.  This code came from a disgruntled ex-NSA cryptographer, and he seems to be holding the NSA hostage.  There is murder, mystery, and mayhem and I had little clue who the villain was until the very end.<br />Through it all, Brown also presents the debate on how much the government should be allowed to know vs. the freedoms of our citizens. Should the NSA be able to snoop our e-mail and phone conversations at will?  It's a tough balancing act.<br />So, if you're looking for great literature, this isn't it.  But if you want a book that is suspenseful, fast-paced and thoroughly entertaining, Dan Brown is your man.	2004-06-02

Not only was it chosen as a Today's Book Club selection, but most reviews have been very favorable.  I must admit that I was a bit disappointed.<br />The Photograph opens with a landscape history professor and widower, Glyn Peters, searching through some old papers. He discovers a photograph of his late wife, Kath, holding hands with her brother-in-law.  Kathy was an incredible beauty and a free spirit who seemed to have it all.  But this picture shows Glyn that there is a Kath that he doesn't know at all, and it rocks his world.  All of a sudden, he's confronted with a host of baffling questions.  Was Kath really happy?  Was her affair with brother-in-law Nick full blown?  Were there other men?  Who else knew about this affair?  And especially, how does this change Glyn's perception of his marriage?  He becomes obsessed with trying to find the answers to these questions, and the book reads a bit like a mystery.  Each person Glyn questions (family, friends and acquaintances) is forced to revisit the Kath they knew and the relationship they had with her.  And they each learn that this happy-go-lucky free spirit had a very dark side nobody took the time to discover.<br />The concept that one photograph can change the lives of so many people is a tantalizing one.  Each chapter is written from the viewpoint of one of the main characters, and Lively has a knack for making her characters very real (although most of them weren't very likable).  But on the negative side, I found the plot to be very plodding and deliberate in many spots.  With only 40 pages left to read, it took me three nights to finish as fatigue got the better of me before my curiosity did.  It also had way too much description in parts, and I got tired of reading about gardens, ponds, flowers, trees, walls and pergolas.<br /><br />But just when I was feeling very let down, Lively gives us a grand ending that made this book worthwhile.

As an avid reader of all things Roosevelt, I was rather disappointed in Rodger Streitmatter's Empty Without You: The Intimate Letters of Eleanor Roosevelt and Lorena Hickok.  The story of how Eleanor and Lorena (Hick) became such intimate friends (maybe even physically intimate) is a fascinating one.  Hick was a hard-nosed AP reporter who had a successful 20 year career in a profession dominated almost exclusively by men.  In the course of covering FDR's first campaign, she found a kindred spirit in Eleanor.  Both women were needy:  they both had tough childhoods, suffered humiliations and tragedies, and were deeply wounded by those they loved.  They struck up a lifelong friendship, although the intensity of this relationship waned after the first 3 years.  During the course of this friendship, they wrote each other almost every day, and sometimes more than one letter in a day.  Hick also lived at the White House for some of this time.<br />What I found so disappointing about Empty Without You is that out of the many thousands of letters that Eleanor and Hick exchanged throughout their lifetime, Hick destroyed a good many of them-especially those letters from the beginning of their relationship when it was the most intense.  There are not many surprises here, and those few that allow a peak at their level of intimacy have been extensively quoted in other Roosevelt books.  Also, I found that the story itself is rather depressing.  Hick gave Eleanor the knowledge and power to recast the job of First Lady so that Eleanor could better achieve her own political agenda.  She encouraged Eleanor to give weekly news conferences with only women reporters invited.  She also prodded Eleanor to start writing newspaper columns-monthly at first, and then her daily My Day column that ran for 27 years.  Finally, Hick suggested that Eleanor write her autobiography before FDR's first term was even finished.  At first, Eleanor depended on Hick to help her with her writing.  But Eleanor was a quick study and soon no longer needed Hick.  Unfortunately, in broadening her horizons, Eleanor had less and less time for Hick.  To make matters worse, Hick was forced to give up her newspaper job because of conflicts of interest, and took on a job traveling the country on behalf of FERA to report on the progress of relief programs.  Hick missed the career that had brought her great success, name recognition, positive reinforcement and financial security.  Hick also suffered from depression and mood swings-especially when her time with Eleanor did not go as planned.  Unfortunately for Hick, her ugly and frequent outbursts were an embarrassment to Eleanor and had just the opposite effect: instead of bringing them even closer, Eleanor started to pull away.  Still, Eleanor never completely abandoned Hick and did much to take care of her (especially financially) as they aged.<br />One thing that I did enjoy about Empty Without You are the reports that Hick wrote for FERA.  Although she mostly gave snippets of these in her letters to Eleanor, boss Harry Hopkins was correct when he predicted that Hick's well-written reports would in the future become a window on the Great Depression.  But overall, there is not much new or enlightening in this book.  If you want to know more about the relationship between Eleanor and Lorena, I'd stick with Doris Faber's Life of Lorena Hickok: E.R.'s Friend.or was a quick study and soon no longer needed Hick.

I am a lover of almost all types of mysteries, but never before have I read a mystery that takes place during the Civil War.  Owen Parry has filled this void with Faded Coat of Blue.  This is a delightfully charming book that doesn't gloss over the dark side of war.<br />Abolitionist and Army Captain Anthony Fowler is found murdered on the edge of an army encampment near Washington DC in the early days of the war.  General George McClellan chooses unsuspecting clerk, Captain Abel Jones, to investigate the murder.  Jones is a transplanted Welshman who has already seen warfare in India as part of the Queen's army.  Coming to the US for a better life, he finds himself pulled into the Civil War.  Jones can best be described as a plodder. He is not a brilliant man, but a loyal, fair and deliberate one.  He has strong Christian values and tries to live his life by them.  Jones latches on to this murder inquiry and refuses to let up-even when he discovers the disturbing truth, his life is threatened and his superiors call him off the case.<br />Parry is a master at making us feel that we are living during the 1860's.  He fills his book with enough historical fact to be convincing, and has thoroughly researched such topics as The Civil War, the military, immigration, prostitution, disease, food, clothing and general conditions at this point in time.  One of the best parts in this book is a conversation that takes place between Abel Jones and Abraham Lincoln.  Although such a conversation is totally fictional, Parry has enough knowledge of Lincoln to write a dialogue that could have actually passed from Lincoln's lips.<br />But what makes this such a charming and delightful book is Jones himself.  Written in the first person, Jones speaks with the rich and lyrical language of a man from Wales.  I will admit that it took me a chapter or two to grow accustomed to this style of speech.  But once I did, I was smitten.  Jones is also a keen observer of human nature, and some of his observations are priceless.  A few that caught my eye include:<br />\\"War disappoints long before it kills.\\"<br />\\"The wickedest place in hell should be reserved for those who paint war in glory and cause young men to dream of it.\\"<br />\\"There is too much puffery and pretense in a novel for me.  It is very much a lady's province, and I always suspect the men who write the things of unsound habits.\\"<br />Abel Jones is sometimes a little too rigid and self-deprecating to a fault.  But he is an endearing character, nonetheless.<br />Faded Coat of Blue is a book that I hated to see end.  But the good news is that Parry is making the exploits of Abel Jones into a series, and Call Each River Jordan, Shadows of Glory and Honor's Kingdom have already been published.  They have definitely been added to my reading list.his observations are priceless.

US	53052945	RJVPTONC1KY3Z	0671027360	141370518	Angels & Demons	Books	4	11	12	N	N	Brain candy...	A friend gave me Dan Brown's Angels and Demons and advised me to read it before his more famous The DaVinci Code.  I was surprised to read some really negative reviews.  Yes, the book is not without some flaws.  The characters could be fleshed out a little more, there are numerous errors, and the ending was a bit hokey.  But Brown takes his readers on a thrilling, fast-paced ride with lots of twists, turns and bumps.  I was so anxious as I neared the end that I read the last 200 pages of this 569 page book in one night.<br />Angels and Demons starts out with an elite scientist/priest being murdered at a top secret nuclear research facility, C.E.R.N.  The body has been branded with the word \\"Illuminati.  The Illuminati was a powerful, clandestine group founded during the days of Galileo when the Roman Catholic Church was persecuting scientists and suppressing scientific discoveries.  The victim, Leonardo Vetra, has been trying to prove through science the existence of God.  Vetra, and his daughter Vittoria, have developed a revolutionary new discovery-antimatter.  It has the potential to be the greatest source of energy, but it also has the power of mass annihilation.  Vetra's killer has stolen a considerable amount of this antimatter from Vetra's lab.<br />The C.E.R.N. director calls in Harvard professor and expert on religious symbology, Robert Langdon.  Langdon has extensive knowledge about The Illuminati.  Langdon teams up with Vittoria to try and solve this mystery.  Not only must they find the stolen antimatter (which has been stashed somewhere inside The Vatican and will explode within hours), but they also must help to find four kidnapped cardinals (on the eve of the election of a new pope).<br />For those who find fault with this book, there is so much that makes it worth the read.  We get some history on Roman Catholicism, the papacy and The Vatican.  We learn many tidbits of Vatican trivia.  The Vatican Archives and Library must be an unbelievable treasure trove.  We also learn some tidbits about Rome-her history, her famous landmarks, churches, fountains and works of art.  Brown takes us through the steps to electing a new pope.  And of course, there is the age-old discussion of organized religion vs. religious belief vs. science.  But what makes Angels and Demons especially fascinating is that there is so much truth interspersed throughout the book.  C.E.R.N. is a real research facility, and antimatter has already been discovered.  The Illuminati were an actual group, and we're left wondering if they really died out (as Langdon surmises).  And of course, there is all that history previously mentioned.<br />This book has a blockbuster ending that includes a miracle or two.  It was a little far fetched in spots, but still enjoyable.  And I had not a clue who the real villain was until the very end.<br />So despite some flaws, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Angels and Demons.

US	53052945	RAIUN15IK51C4	0380731851	733601761	Mystic River	Books	5	2	3	N	Y	Mystery with some meat...	There are many mysteries written today that are light, fluffy and entertaining.  Some are a little more serious.  And then there is Dennis Lehane's Mystic River.  It will blow the rest of them out of the water.  I was just floored by this powerful book.<br />The lives of three 11 year old boys are changed forever when one of them is abducted in a car.  While the abducted boy escapes after four days and has a happy homecoming, things will never be the same.  The event will scar each of them in a way that will leave them somewhat broken and will affect them the rest of their lives.  It also causes the end of their childhood friendship.<br />Twenty-five years later, Sean is a state trooper with a failing marriage.  Jimmy is an ex-convict trying to put the past behind him and raise three daughters.  And Dave still tries to deal with the demons that haunt him ever since he was abducted as a boy.  The lives of these three will converge again when one of their daughters is brutally murdered.<br />What makes Mystic River so outstanding is that Lehane is a good study of human nature.  We see people trying to be strong and confident when they're not.  We read about families trying to survive in difficult circumstances.  Fathers try to make the lives of their children a little better than their own.  Lehane is also a keen observer of relationships, and some of his observations are downright profound.  He definitely has the pulse of marriages, friendships and families as they all deal with stress, grief, love, hate, jealousy, passion, survival and revenge.  It makes for a fascinating story.<br />I've read many reviews that are critical of the ending.  I think the ending is just perfect-dark and unpredictable with a major issue left unresolved.  Perhaps Lehane wants to remind us that life isn't fair and that not everything works out in the end.  In fact, it more accurately reflects our own gray world, even though most people would rather see things in black and white.<br />I haven't seen the movie yet, but have heard rave reviews about the acting.  After enjoying the book so much, I can't wait until it comes out on DVD.haven't seen the movie yet, but have heard rave reviews about the acting.

If you thought that Janet Evanovich's One for the Money was hysterical, Two for the Dough will have you in stitches!  We get to learn a bit more about bounty hunter, Stephanie Plum.  In trying to capture Kenny Mancuso while trying to track down a truckload of stolen caskets, Stephanie stumbles onto something much more serious and even life threatening.  Many scenes take place in a funeral home in Trenton, and the antics of Grandma Mazur will have you wetting your pants.  No corpse is safe when she's around!<br />Many of the regular characters become more fleshed out including Vinnie, Connie, Ranger, and especially heartthrob cop Joe Morelli.  The best character in the bunch is Lula-a prostitute introduced in book one who now wants to join Stephanie as a bounty hunter.  Think 200+ pound African American in spandex miniskirts. The two of them working together is a blast.  Stephanie is also becoming a little more savvy in her job and now sports a stun-gun.  But she still has much to learn, which makes the story funny and maybe a little more realistic (no James Bond-types to be found here).<br />I read the book first, and then listened to the audio version.  One thing that is really annoying with many audio books (this one included) is that so many of the readers mispronounce so many words-especially names of places.  Also, this book was only made available in the abridged version.  But even so, Evanovich will have you coming back for more.	2004-04-27

I picked up David Dickinson's Goodnight Sweet Prince because I am fascinated with the Victorian era, and especially, with Queen Victoria and her family.  The Sweet Prince in the title is Prince Albert Victor, oldest son of the Prince of Wales (later to become King Edward VII) and second in line to the throne.  Prince Eddy (as he is nicknamed) wasn't the brightest or most honorable of souls.  He had no interest in learning and would probably be classified as special education today.  He also had unorthodox sexual preferences, and was known to frequent prostitutes of both sexes.  It was rumored that he had syphilis, and there was even talk that he was the real Jack the Ripper.  His family was hoping that a marriage to Princess May of Teck would help set him straight and make him more respectable.  Just days before his wedding, he died suddenly of influenza at the age of 28.  But was influenza the real killer?<br />It is not a stretch to think that maybe Prince Eddy was murdered.  He was an embarrassment to his family and would have made a questionable monarch.  Britain and the Royal Family had nothing to lose and everything to gain by his death.  In fact, Britain was much better off having Eddy's brother, King George V and his bride, Queen Mary (Eddy's former fianc&eacute;e) lead the Empire through World War I.  It is also believable that the Royal Family engaged in a cover-up.  For those who think that they couldn't possibly stoop so low should remember that this is the same family who euthanized King George V as he was dying.  They wanted his death to be reported first in the morning newspapers, and not the scandal sheet evening tabloids.<br />But what I did find a stretch was the plot itself.  A British Lord, Francis Powerscourt, dabbles as a private investigator.  He travels all over the Empire and Italy in search of the killer.  There are scandals and cover-ups going back many years that Powerscourt must uncover.  Interspersed throughout is a romance that I don't think adds much to the story.  Also, although the book is filled with many true facts (the many affairs of the Prince of Wales, the many scandals involving Prince Eddy, etc.), there are also many more tidbits that are total fiction.  There is also very little about the Royal Family-a disappointment to me.<br />So as mysteries go, Goodnight Sweet Prince did not live up to my expectations, although I have to admit that I have read a lot worse.adds much to the story.

And Vespers is one of the best of the bunch.  The detectives of the 87th Precinct are faced with the brutal murder of a young priest from a poor, inner-city parish.  There are very few clues, but through hard work and perseverance, they're able to assemble a short list of suspects.  Each suspect has their own sub-plot, and they include a drug dealer and his supplier, a volatile, violent parishioner, a congregation of Satanic worshippers and a mysterious woman who was having an affair with the victim.<br />Eventually, detectives Hawes and Carella are able to piece together the mystery and the ending came as a complete surprise!  I wasn't even close to guessing the identity of the murderer.<br />So if you're looking for a mystery with a little more meat and a little less fluff, McBain is your man.  His novels definitely provide a more realistic look at police-work in a big city than many other authors.	2004-04-18

While the first book I read was a bit fluffy, this Edgar award-winning book really packs a punch.  New Orleans Mourning starts out with a bang when Mardi Gras King of Rex is murdered during a Mardi Gras parade.  Policewoman, Skip Langdon, witnesses the whole thing and is quickly included in this homicide investigation.  The King is Chauncey St. Amant, who has more than his fair share of enemies, including most members of his own family.<br />In the process of investigating the murder, Langdon discovers that there are a whole bunch of skeletons in the St. Amand closet.  In fact, the St. Amand's have all the high drama and dysfunction of a Tennessee William's play.  And the closer Skip gets to solving the murder, the more someone tries to scare her off the case.  This fabulous mystery has a great ending and will leave you shaking your head.<br />Although the mystery itself is quite good, my favorite parts of New Orleans Mourning were the descriptions of New Orleans.  Smith goes into great detail about the history of the city, the evolution of Mardi Gras, the development of jazz, etc.  New Orleans is unlike any other city in the US and is one of my favorite places to visit.  It was also helpful to read the first Skip Langdon to get much needed background on how and why Langdon becomes a police officer.	2004-04-18

Axel Speeter seems weird by most people's standards, but he seems to have everything under control, and likes it just fine.  He's lived in a room at a Motel 6 for as long as he can remember.  He keeps all of his clothes and personal belongings in milk crates and Folger's coffee cans stacked along one wall.  He mistrusts banks and his life savings of $266,000 can also be found in those coffee cans.  He runs a taco concession at the Minnesota State Fair.  And his surrogate family consists of one of his workers, and her college-age daughter.<br />In Richard Hautman's Mortal Nuts, things seem just swell until Carmen (Speeter's surrogate daughter and sometimes druggie college student) mentions to her ex-convict, Aryan Nation boyfriend that Speeter keeps large sums of cash in his room.  This sets off a chain of events that start at the beginning of the fair and lasting the weekend and a half that the fair runs.<br />Hautman is a master at oddball characters, and there are more than enough of them in Mortal Nuts.  It's also fun to see the workings of the Minnesota State Fair-from the food concessions and the freak shows, to the show animals and the rides.  It truly is a world unknown to many readers, myself included.<br />This is my second Peter Hautman, and he continues to grow on me with each book I read.	2004-04-18

To say that this is the most interesting, quirky, entertaining and fun mystery that I have read in a long time would be an understatement.  Things start off very quickly when the local high school principal of a small town in Minnesota is found bludgeoned to death.  Principal Egge is not very well liked, and almost everyone becomes a suspect.  Events snowball out of control, and soon we have another murder, some poisoned dogs, slit tires, threatening graffiti several assault victims, and some unsettled spirits, to boot.<br />The plot of Soldier's Gap is very well done and when you think you've got everything figured out, you'll still be missing some key pieces.  But what drives this successful novel are the characters-they're a scream!  They show us all their quirks in a way that could only be observed in a small town.  First, Deputy Jenkins is a nice enough guy, but seems to be living under a cloud.  There's Sheriff Kline who smokes and eats too much, tells horrible jokes, and is a walking heart attack.  Also on staff is half-breed Mingo Jones, who is trying hard to reconnect to his Native side.  There is a city council woman who tries to run the town like she ran her 3rd grade classroom.  Add to this mix a superintendent of schools with the morals of an ally cat, and a host of disaffected teens who grew up in dysfunctional families, and are now pretty dysfunctional themselves.<br />But what makes Soldier's Gap even more entertaining is Schwinghammer's genius at turning a phrase and his word play.  He describes someone looking like \\"the cat that ate a very expensive South American macaw.\\"  Something else is \\"dead as disco.\\"  It makes for hysterical reading!<br />I am very impressed with Schwinghammer's first effort, but it leaves me rather unsettled.  This is a book that I heard about on Amazon, but I don't think it's had many mainstream reviews.  Yet, it ranks up there with the best that I've read in the last several years.  How many other fabulous books are out there that never get reviewed by national sources? And how many more never get published?  I hope that this author publishes his next book sooner, rather than later.I've read in the last several years.

Mysteries are so popular today, and there seem to be so many different styles.  One author writes police drama, and another PI cases.  And then there are the many \\"themed\\" mysteries including cooking themes, antique themes, Native American themes, etc.  And then there is Janet Evanovich with her Stephanie Plum series, which falls into the \\"hysterical\\" theme!<br />In One for the Money, we are introduced to Stephanie Plum.  Stephanie lives in Trenton, NJ, was just laid off from her job as a lingerie buyer, and is desperate for work.  Through a series of threats and blackmail, she gets her sleazy cousin Vinnie (who owns his own bail bond company) to hire her as a recovery agent.  Of course she is clueless about being a bounty agent, and is given an especially tough job right off the bat-bringing in Joe Morelli, a vice-cop accused of murder.<br />The plot is a scream and it will have you laughing out loud (make sure not to eat or drink while you're reading).  But the characters are what make this book, and they're characters that you could only find in Trenton!  Grandma Mazur will have you in stitches.  Also, while some mysteries showcase cops or PI's who are always on top of their game, Stephanie bumbles through her cases, which is probably more realistic in the long run.  You will also enjoy the descriptions of Trenton-the row houses, the nosy neighbors, the stores, the big-haired girls in spandex, and especially, the food.<br />So, if you want to read one of the funniest mysteries around, start with Evanovich's One for the Money.	2004-04-18

David Baldacci has given his readers another barnburner with his latest book, Split Second.  Secret Service agent Sean King is on the campaign trail with a presidential candidate, when this candidate is assassinated right under Sean's nose.  Although  King isn't the team leader, he takes the blame and ultimately leaves the service and tries to pick up the pieces of his shattered life.  Fast forward eight years.  Rising star Secret Service agent Michelle Maxwell has the presidential candidate she's guarding kidnapped under mysterious circumstances.  Maxwell seeks out King to compare notes, and as they dig, they discover that not only are there many similarities between the two cases, but that they're actually connected.<br />As with most Baldacci books, this one is filled with murder and mayhem, bugs and bombs, and a few kidnappings.  You also suspect that one of the bad guys is working on the inside, but I couldn't figure it out until the person revealed him/herself.  The ride has enough twists and turns to make you carsick, and the plot will keep you guessing until the end.<br />One thing I have noticed about Baldacci as he becomes more prolific, and that is more of the good guys are still alive at the end of the book.  This might make for happier endings and more satisfied readers, but it doesn't make a book more realistic.  Still, this one will keep you at the edge of your seat from start to finish.	2004-04-18

I also feel that this is a story where the review should not spoil the plot for those people who have yet to read it.  So I will keep this short.  But I will say that the reader will fall in love with Pi Patel-the 16 year old son of a zookeeper, whose family is attempting to move from India to Canada.  You will love Pi's intelligence, his innocence, his quick thinking, and especially his faith.  You will also marvel at the relationship Pi achieves with an unlikely character, and how they help each other to survive an amazing ordeal.  You will also be amazed at what Pi has to do to survive.  The Life of Pi is definitely a book that ends with more questions than answers, and it will haunt you long after you've finished reading.  My only criticism is that I feel the religious theme could have been played throughout the book a little more than it did.  But despite this, The Life of Pi is a great effort by the author, and I found that I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find out the ending.	2004-04-02

Carl Hiaason has set the standard for wacky, crazy, side-splitting hilarious mysteries with a serious message, and after several near misses, Hiaason is back in the game with Sick Puppy.  Taking place in Florida, a young eco-terrorist millionaire, Twilly Spree, is on a rampage over a chronic litterbug.  But unfortunately for the litterbug, Twilly's vigilance uncovers a much more serious problem than just litter.  In fact, Palmer Stoat is a sleaze-ball, lobbyist who is trying to trash the entire state of Florida by turning pristine barrier islands into large golfing communities.<br />As with most Hiaason books, the characters are a scream. In addition to Twilly and Palmer, we have a sexual pervert, a crazy hit man, a spineless governor, two porno stars, a ruthless developer, a kidnapped wife, a sick dog, and a host of crooked politicians.  We also see the return of Skink, ex-governor turned eco-vigilante.  But Skink has a more minor role than in previous books, and the story really belongs to Twilly (kind of a Skink in training).  The plot has some amazing twists and turns, and the ending will blow you away.  But for all the hilarity, Hiaason has an important message about the rape of Florida by tourists, politicians and especially developers.  And while the good guys usually end up winning in Hiaason's books, that usually doesn't happen in real life where money and greed are involved.<br />The only thing that kept me from giving Sick Puppy 5 stars was the fact that there are a large number of characters and it was difficult at first to keep them all straight.  In fact, I purchased the abridged book-on-tape for a trip, and several of the more minor characters and sub-plots were eliminated.  It made the story much easier to follow.  Still, I loved this book and would rate it not just my favorite Hiaason, but also one of my favorite mysteries.	2004-03-26

Gwen Bristow's Celia Garth may have been published in 1959, but it is truly a classic that is just as timely today.  Charleston is always associated with the Civil War, but most Americans do not realize how much fighting went on in and around Charleston during the Revolution.  In fact, there were more Revolutionary War battles in South Carolina than in any southern state.<br />In Celia Garth, we follow the life of a 20 year old seamstress.  Celia goes back and forth between a Charleston townhouse and a plantation on the outskirts of town, and we receive a look at what it was like to live during the Revolution.  The book ties in many historically documented facts including Francis Marion and his men, the British bombardment of Charleston, the siege of Charleston, British atrocities to plantations, the rebel spy network, actual battles and many famous military leaders.  It is fascinating to read how Charlestonians were forced by Patriot troops to give up all their food supplies (except for rice), causing townsfolk to starve.  Life was definitely not easy.<br />It is also fun to read about sites that are still in Charleston, and how they figured in the struggle.  St. Michael's Church steeple was painted black to make it harder for British warships to see.  Also, Patriots stored over 10,000 pounds of gunpowder in the basement of the Old Exchange building so that it would not fall into Loyalists hands.  The British never did find it-even after they took control of the city and the Exchange Building.<br />The story itself is riveting, and I found myself staying up extra late to keep on reading.  I couldn't wait to see what happened next.  Although this was written with teenage girls in mind, don't let this be a deterrent.  The 300 plus pages and the heavy dose of history make for extremely interesting reading.  So, if you can get your hands on this classic, you've discovered a true treasure.	2004-03-23

Author Edward Ball comes from a long line of plantation owners from the Low Country of South Carolina.  In his first book, National Book Award-winner Slaves in the Family, Ball set out to trace the ancestors of slaves once owned by the Ball family.  Little did he realize that this research would lead to the discovery of his own ancestors of color, and what a fascinating tale this would be.  This story is the basis of his second book, The Sweet Hell Inside, which is one of the most moving, poignant and haunting books I have ever read.<br />The Sweet Hell begins with plantation owner, William Harleston.  Harleston never married, but took a house slave named Kate as his common-law wife.  Together, they produced eight children.  After the Civil War, William purchased a house in Charleston for Kate and the children, and even left her an inheritance when he died (something rare in the 19th century South).  The story of the Harleston family is a study of Charleston's high yellow society, or the black elite.  Not accepted into white culture, they were also not comfortable among their freed slave brethren.  Ball follows four generations of the black Harlestons.  We see that they were educated, sent to college, trained in various professions, and lived a very comfortable life.  The members of this family were also multi-talented.  They became businessmen, sea captains, artists, musicians, pastors, photographers, and influential members of Charleston's black society.<br />Much of the success of the Harleston family begins with Kate and William's son, Edwin.  Edwin started the Harleston Funeral Home to provide upper-class black families with the same services offered by white undertakers (who would not handle black clients).  The short history that Ball provides about the mortuary business is fascinating.  Several other family members stand out in this book.  Edwin's son, Teddy, becomes a classically trained painter.  Unfortunately, he is needed in the funeral business and his painting career suffers.  Edwin's daughter, Ella, marries the Rev. Joseph Jenkins.  Together, they run the famous Jenkins Orphanage.  There are a host of other brothers, sisters, nieces and nephews that make-up the tapestry of this wonderful story.<br />But for as fortunate as this family was, they also suffered more than their share of heartaches including infertility, economic setbacks, illness, and early death.  They also faced discrimination in their hometown.  A musician moved to Europe to earn the respect he deserved as a performer and composer.  Teddy had to travel north to enjoy classic artwork in museums (Charleston's museums were for whites only). Also, his own city never recognized his artistic talents until after his death.  Pneumonia, heart disease, a ruptured appendix and TB were among the maladies that cut down family members in their prime.<br />The Sweet Hell was a book I didn't want to end.  There is a family tree and many photos of family, places and even Teddy's artwork.  But I wanted more.  So on a trip to Charleston, I visited many of the places mentioned in the book.  First, I rode by Kate Harleston's house (the original homestead).  Since the book was published, this dilapidated house is now being renovated.  I discovered that I have passed the Harleston Funeral Home hundreds of times, but never noticed it before.  It is still in operation, although no longer run by the Harleston family. I found the Plymouth Congregational Church, where most of the Harleston's worshipped.  The most moving sight was the old Jenkins Orphanage.  The orphanage and the Old Jail both share a block.  It was eerie walking in this now quiet, residential neighborhood, trying to imagine what it must have been like when hundreds of orphans and hundreds of inmates were both in residence. Add a Jenkins band or two, and it must have been a happening place!<br />All in all, I just can't say enough good things about The Sweet Hell Inside.  Edward Ball's new effort proves thathe is a writer with an incredible voice.that he is a writer with an incredible voice.	2004-03-17

National Book Award-winner, Slaves in the Family, is one of the best nonfiction books I have read in the past ten years.  Edward Ball comes from a very prominent family of plantation owners in the Charleston Low Country.  The patriarch, Elias Ball, immigrates to the colonies in the late 1600's.  Being very prolific when it came to progeny, he soon had children and grandchildren owning over two dozen plantations along the Ashley and Cooper Rivers.  After the Civil War, the Ball plantations were sold or lost, one by one.  Yet today, the Balls are still very prominent in Charleston Society.  Their family tree is well documented, and instead of being plantation owners, they now count lawyers, judges, doctors and priests among their ranks.<br />In Edward Ball's first effort, he sets out to find the descendants of the thousands of Ball family slaves.  This was no easy task.  Many slaves had no last names.  Others moved to distant states.  Some descendants had no wish to speak with him.  Ball also encountered reticence from his own family.  The extended family did not like to talk about slavery.  On the few occasions when the subject was raised, they all espoused the party line: 1. Balls never mistreated their slaves  2. Balls never separated slave families and 3. Ball masters never slept with female slaves.<br />Using surviving Ball journals, diaries, ledgers and inventories, Edward was able to contact a good many slave descendants.  I found the most moving parts of the book are when Edward's research validates the oral history of many slave ancestors, and in some cases, helped them to fill in the missing pieces of their genealogical puzzle.  Edward's research also helps him to discover more about his own ancestors.  Contrary to Ball oral history, not all Ball plantation owners treated their slaves admirably.  Also, slave families were sometimes separated-although mostly due to economic necessity (i.e. when slaves were sold to settle an estate).  But what really shocked the author was when he discovered that he had ancestors of color!  But save that topic for another book.<br />The only part of Slaves in the Family that bothered me was Edward Ball's insistence on being an apologist for slavery. Although slavery was a horrible institution, Ball was in no way responsible for what his ancestors did hundreds of years ago. Still, this is just a minor distraction in an otherwise fabulous book.  In addition to reading Slaves in the Family, I also listened to it on tape and enjoyed it just as much the second time around.

I loved Edward Ball's first literary efforts, Slaves in the Family and The Sweet Hell Inside.  They both touched my heart in a way that few books have managed.  So I ordered Peninsula of Lies: A Story of Mysterious Birth and Taboo Love before it was even published, anticipating great things.  I must admit that I was rather disappointed.  Ball follows the life of Gordon Hall, who claimed his gender was misidentified at birth.  Gordon (Dawn) ends up in the 1960's living in Charleston, SC, and the book traces his sex change operation, his marriage to a black man, and the birth of a daughter.<br />Ball sets out to answer some troubling questions including: Was Gordon/Dawn really misidentified as a male at birth?  What exactly did her surgery entail?  Was her daughter really her biological daughter?  And if not, where did she come from?  Ball conducted lots of research including interviews with family members, friends, and even some of Dawn's doctors.  As a result of this research, Ball gives us a crash course on sexual deviations including the difference between homosexuals, transsexuals, transvestites and hermaphrodites.  He also recounts the history of sex reassignments (sex change operations) in the 20th century.  And in the process, he unravels the mystery about the controversial figure.<br />Before Peninsula of Lies was even published, it was touted as Charleston's answer to John Berendt's bestseller, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.  Unfortunately, Berendt fans will be greatly disappointed.  Midnight has increased overnight tourism in Savannah by tens of millions of visitors, as readers flock to the city to see the various sites mentioned in the book (especially the Mercer House).  Peninsula of Lies will have a fraction of that impact on Charleston, if any.  I can't envision Peninsula of Lies tour buses roaming the streets of Charleston.  The only site I'd make an effort to see is Dawn's Society Street house.<br />Still, the story is quirky and interesting.  Dawn was a published author, and wrote a number of books including biographies of Princess Margaret and Lady Bird Johnson.  She also inherited a fortune from Isabel Whitney, but ended up spending it all rather quickly.  There are a good many photographs and drawings that are quite good including photos from her wedding, of her daughter, her Charleston house, and her pets.  However, this book did not live up to expectations, and it is definitely not another Midnight.  It also doesn't come close to Ball's first two efforts..

Having been a Romanov fan for over 30 years, I don't know how Journey by Robert and Suzanne Massie escaped my notice for so long.  Written in journal style, both authors alternate entries that detail their experiences with hemophilia on many different levels.<br />First, their oldest child, Robert Jr. (Bobby) was born in 1956, and was quickly diagnosed with hemophilia.  Journey chronicles their experiences in dealing with this disease on a first hand basis for the first 18 years of their son's life.  Second, it shows how they educated themselves about this chronic, debilitating and sometimes fatal disease.  At that time, the treatment of hemophilia was not very sophisticated, and they were often at the cutting edge of pioneering treatment.  Thirdly, in the course of their research, they became fascinated with the story of Queen Victoria and how hemophilia (that was passed through her) affected so many of the royal houses in Europe.  This led them to the last Tsar and Tsarina, Nicholas and Alexandra Romanov.  The Tsarevich Alexei was a hemophiliac and how Nicholas and Alexandra dealt with this crisis changed the course of Russian history and the Russian monarchy.  The Massie's also give great details about the different forms of hemophilia-some more severe than others.  We learn that Alexei had a relatively mild form of the disease.  While the only treatment available in the early 1900's was ice and immobilization, Bobby Massie required hundreds and hundreds of transfusions to get him through childhood.  And finally, Journey details the politics of the American Red Cross, and various government agencies and private companies in dealing with the treatment and manufacturing of blood agents for hemophiliacs.  Don't believe for a minute that their first priority is what is best for the patient.<br />This book also relates the story of how their research led to Robert's writing the classic, Nicholas and Alexandra.  This was the book that hooked me on the Romanov's while still in high school, and is still today one of the best written on this subject.<br />Journey was published in 1973 and much has happened since then.  There are now many more treatment options available in the treatment of hemophilia.  Unfortunately, much of the blood supply used for treatment was contaminated by HIV in the 1980's and many hemophiliacs ended up with AIDS.  But the good news is that Bobby has grown into a brilliant man.  After receiving degrees from Princeton, Yale, and Harvard, he is now an Episcopal priest and a published, award winning author in his own right.  He is married with several children.  The bad news is that for whatever reason, Robert and Suzanne Massie's marriage did not survive.

Millions of words have been written about the Civil War, but Pulitzer Prize-winning author, Tony Horwitz, provides some refreshing insights in Confederates in the Attic: Dispatches from the Unfinished Civil War.  Traveling through ten different states, Horwitz sets out to answer several ageold questions about The Civil War (or The Late Great Unpleasantness or The War of Northern Aggression-depending on which side you're on).  But first and foremost, why can't Southerners put the Civil War behind them?  Why do so many of them insist on living in the past?  Each chapter is written from a different state and they are informative, disturbing, poignant, and often downright hysterical.  Just the chapter names are amusing including \\"At the Foote of the Master\\" (about expert Shelby Foote), \\"Gone With the Window\\" (about Atlanta's continuing obsession with Gone With the Wind), and \\"The Oldest Confederate Widow Tells Some.\\"<br />Horwitz traipses through battlefields, camps with re-enactors, seeks out little-known stories, and checks out dusty museums and personal collections.  He also talks with dozens of people (both Civil War experts and simple folk) about such topics as slavery, The Daughters of the Confederacy, the Confederate flag controversy, Civil Rights, prisoner of war camps, The Ku Klux Klan, and various Civil War luminaries.<br />The most enjoyable parts of the book involve Horwitz tagging along with some hardcore re-enactors.  His romantic vision of a cozy re-enactment weekend (complete with camp fire, hardy stew and good camaraderie) is quickly burst when he's made to remove or discard almost everything he has including his clothes, eyeglasses and food (they're not vintage 1860's).  Also, Confederate re-enactors tend to constantly starve themselves to obtain the appearance of emaciated Southern soldiers.  Some hardcores even go so far as to soak uniform buttons in urine to achieve the correct \\"patina.\\"  This sounds more like work than fun.<br />Horwitz definitely provides us with some new material, interesting observations, and refreshing insights.  In fact, I enjoyed it enough after reading it that I purchased the unabridged book on tape so that my husband and I could listen to it while traveling.  I can't think of too many nonfiction books that I've enjoyed more!tely provides us with some new material, interesting observations, and refreshing insights.

Pete Hautman's Short Money is a delightfully charming, outrageously funny mystery along the lines of Carl Hiaason.  Hartman takes us on a runaway roller coaster ride with policeman, Joe Crow.  Crow's life is out of control, and he has drug problems, marriage problems and job problems.  Of course, most of his problems are of his own making.<br />Joe takes a new job that seems rather simple, and things are never as simple as they first appear.  The plot is hysterically funny and without giving too much away, Joe has to deal with a sleazy brother-in-law lawyer, a runaway kid, a missing cat, two crazy brothers (one downright psychopathic), a scheming plastic surgeon, a druggie wife, a farm for canned hunts, and several wild animals.  There are more than a few belly laughs, and I actually had tears rolling down my cheeks from laughing so hard in several spots.<br />I have been told that Short Money is not Hautman's best effort.  If this is the case, I can't wait to read more.	2004-03-12

With all the positive reviews, I was looking forward to a great read.  Was I ever disappointed!  All I can say is that I guess I just don't get it.  After 830+ pages, I don't see what so many readers are raving about.<br />Crimson Petal is being touted as a 21st Century Victorian novel. We follow the lives of perfume heir, William Rackhan, and a prostitute named Sugar.  The characters are all terribly unsympathetic.  William turns out to be a cad, and Sugar is less admirable than we are lead to believe.  Wife Agnes Rackhan is downright crazy, and their family doctor is a snake.  There are other assorted characters who are also insufferable.  They seem to float in and out of chapters without contributing very much to the story.<br />The plot is much ado about nothing.  When the story line finally starts picking up, the book ends very abruptly with loose ends dangling left and right.  So much of the plot was also unbelievable.  How often in Victorian society was a prostitute (raised in a brothel, no less) well read enough to discuss class literature with her clients?  How likely is it that someone would bring a prostitute into their very prim and proper home to serve as a governess?  Why would that same prostitute (who was often written up as being one of the best in London) not change her tell-tale name when trying to become part of respectable society?  It just makes for incredulous reading.<br />I'm not saying that there isn't some merit to be found here. I always enjoy reading about Victorian Society, and find that this is a fascinating period in history.  Faber also has a way with words and can often turn a phrase that can border on genius.  But on the whole, I would have rather spent the 2 weeks it took me to read this book, reading something much more enjoyable.  It makes me wonder where Faber's editor was on this one...	2004-03-10

It is only February, but after reading Richard Russo's Straight Man, I predict that I have already read one of the best books I will read this year.  I discovered Richard Russo last year, and having read Empire Falls and Nobody's Fool, this book is the best of the lot.<br />Russo follows the exploits of William Henry Devereaux.  \\"Hank\\" is an English professor and acting chair in a podunk branch of a Pennsylvania state college in a dying town.  At the beginning of the novel, Hank recalls a scene where while driving up a hill that is snow-covered, he loses traction and careens down the hill, out of control.  His life follows a similar path.  He doesn't have a budget at school, hears constant rumors of tenured staff layoffs, tries to oversee an English department that is terribly dysfunctional and trying to remove him as chair, suffers from a physical malady, and always seems to be in the middle of a controversy.  And like several other Richard Russo characters, Hank is his own worst enemy.<br />Still, the story is delightful and Russo a wonderful and creative storyteller!  I was especially drawn to the reflections and observations on everything from marriage, to academia, to life in general.  The cast of characters is a scream and their antics will keep you laughing.  It will also reaffirm your belief that things tend to work out for the best in the end.  I definitely feel that Russo is one of the best authors today, and I can't wait to read his other books.	2004-02-20

I have always been interested in Thomas Jefferson, and always believed that he was the true genius and renaissance man of his time.  It wasn't until reading Walter Isaacson's Benjamin Franklin: An American Life that I discovered how underrated Franklin is in the recording of our nations history.  There are many reasons for the overlooking of Franklin in our past.  First, he wasn't a young buck at the founding of our nation--unlike his much younger colleagues including Jefferson, Adams and Washington. He never became president, unlike the three names just mentioned.  Also, he did much of his work for the nation behind the scenes and aboard--first in England trying to change conditions that brought about the Revolution, and then in France trying to convince the French to step into the war on our side.  He was also influential in negotiating a peace settlement with the British.<br />Despite all his success, Franklin always considered himself first and foremost a printer.  He was proud that through hard work and effort, he was able to overcome his lack of formal schooling and become successful.  He didn't believe that a man should receive automatic stature in society based on his name or position.  He wasn't a religious man in terms of organized religion, but was a firm believer that you served God by serving man. He constantly worked on his &quot;virtues&quot; and kept a list of how he fared on 13 different ones each week.<br />I have always thought of Jefferson as the primary inventor of this era, but Jefferson's inventions were mainly mechanical in nature.  It was Franklin who was the true scientist of his time.  He experimented with the relationship between colors and heat, theorized (correctly) on how colds were spread, invented bifocals, figured out how nor'easters traveled, experimented with how oil affects water, and invented the Franklin Stove, the lightening rod and the armonica.  Of course, he is most remembered for his experiments with electricity.  Much of the electrical vocabulary we still use today was first coined by Franklin.<br />Franklin was also a man of great convictions, and used his pen and his presses to forward his beliefs.  Later in life, he became an abolitionist and fought for the end of slavery.  Still, he wasn't a man without faults.  He was especially cold and neglectful toward his family.  However, all in all, Isaacson gives a thorough overview of Franklin's life, trying to balance the public man with the private one. The one major flaw I found in this book is that I felt Isaacson wraps things up too quickly at the end at the expense of the Constitutional Convention.  Also, many events could have been explained in greater detail.  But overall, it is a great biography that provides good insight into this giant of a man.the electrical vocabulary we still use today was first coined by Franklin.<br />Franklin was also a man of great convictions, and used his pen and his presses to forward his beliefs.

Being anxious to read more about Ben Franklin after finishing Walter Isaacson's new biography, I picked up A Little Revenge by Willard Sterne Randall.  I was floored by this fabulous account of the complex relationship between Benjamin Franklin and his illegitimate son, William.  Ben was one of the true geniuses of the 18th century.  He was statesman, lobbyist, peacemaker, writer, printer, inventor, scientist and above all, a staunch patriot.  Unfortunately, all great men have their flaws and Franklin's was in his treatment of his wife and family.  William was born before Ben married, and common-in-law wife Deborah raised William as her own.  Randall details how father and son came to be so totally different in almost all aspects of life.  Ben lived a more simple life, while William liked the trappings of high society.  They had different tastes, different upbringings, different education, different religious beliefs and most importantly, differing political views.  Ben believed in the sanctity of the middle class.  William believed in high society, and his classical English education in the law led him to the position of Royal Governor of New Jersey.  It was this fact that proved to be the wedge that drove father and son apart irrevocably.<br />In many respects, Benjamin was an odd father.  While William was still a schoolboy, Benjamin took him to tour England and Scotland.  Ben kept a ledger of every penny he spent on William for clothes, food and lodging, and considered these expenses a loan.  When William went back to New Jersey to assume his position of Royal Governor, years went by without any communication from Ben.  Ben often  treated his surrogate English family with more care and concern than his wife and children.  Ben also seemed to be unexcited and perhaps even jealous of William's accomplishments.  Father disapproved of William's girlfriends, didn't want him to get married, and left England in a rush to avoid his wedding and the ceremony appointing William governor.  When William had an illegitimate son of his own, Ben and William fought over the child's upbringing, custody, education and even his affections (Benjamin usually won).  Benjamin liked to maintain some control over William-even as an adult, and usually did it by controlling the purse strings.  William liked to live beyond his means and was constantly borrowing money from his father.  Father and son found themselves on opposite sides of the war for independence.  After the war, Benjamin forgave his many English friends and resumed his relationships with them.  He never forgave his son.<br />This book is especially strong in giving details about the French and Indian War, and the period before and during the Revolution.  In fact, I found this book much more informative than Isaacson's critically acclaimed Ben Franklin biography in these areas.  What made this book even more fascinating for me (and thrilling to read) is that many of the major scenes take place in Burlington, NJ-then the capital of West Jersey.  William built a governor's mansion here and the Assembly met here.  I work in Burlington and even worship in the same church (St. Mary's Church, now 301 years old) as William Franklin.  It is hard to believe that this small little pre-Revolutionary town played such a huge role in the founding of our nation.  Randall describes a scene from December 1775. William called the NJ Assembly together in Burlington to try and get them to broker a separate peace with Britain, and to break the back of the Continental Congress.  The rebels sent Sam Adams, George Wythe and John Jay to argue (and win) their case.  The image of these three giants of the Revolution traveling to Burlington is exciting to contemplate. Also, we discover that William has often been maligned throughout history.  He find that he was an intelligent and fair man, and a fairly decent governor.  The fact that he was the last Royal Governor in the colonies probably had something to do withhis leadership abilities.  It is just unfortunate that his blind loyalty to the crown kept him from siding with the rebels, and ultimately led to his imprisonment, the death of his wife, and his exile to England.<br />All in all, I think that Randall's work is masterful, and I enjoyed it even more than Walter Isaacson's Ben Franklin: An American Life.

It is also wonderfully illustrated by Gessler with watercolors.  This 159 page book is packed with a myriad of entertaining tidbits.  It includes historical facts, famous festivals, Charleston vocabulary, places of interest, interesting characters (past and present), famous restaurants, some traditional recipes and LOTS of trivia.  It also touches on such diverse topics as The Civil War, The Citadel, Slavery, making indigo, architectural details and places to shop.<br />Very Charleston is the perfect book for a new visitor to Charleston.  There are a few minor inaccuracies (for example, there are more than 3 zones for carriage tours).  But these do not detract from the book.  However, a visitor seeking a more in-depth look at the Holy City would be better served by more serious reading.  Still, Very Charleston is a very enjoyable and interesting introduction to this beautiful and historic city.	2004-01-28

Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill are two of the most influential men of the 20th Century, and Jon Meacham's Franklin and Winston is a commendable effort.  How the friendship between these two men evolved is a fascinating read.  Theirs was a friendship forged from the war, and Churchill cultivated the relationship knowing that help from the US was the only way to defeat Nazi Germany.  All relationships have their ups and downs, and Churchill and Roosevelt were no exception.  Franklin's treatment toward Winston was downright shabby when they started dealing with Joseph Stalin.  Still, in their many fact-to-face meetings, they were able to do much together including tracking the progress of the war, coordinating allied activities and especially, cutting through red tape when it came to equipment and supplies.<br />There have been other books written about these two giants, but Meacham had the advantage of some newly discovered letters in the FDR library, as well as personal interviews with Mary Soames (Churchill's daughter), Pamela Harriman (Churchill's ex-daughter-in-law), and Robert Hopkins (son of FDR aide and cabinet member, Harry Hopkins).<br />Churchill was a man who wore his emotions for all to see.  It was obvious that he loved and revered FDR and was crushed by his sudden death.  On the other hand, FDR could be a very cold and unemotional man.  He was also a man who used people, and then wrote them off when they were no longer of use to him.  We are left to wonder how their friendship would have survived after the end of the war if FDR had lived--especially after Churchill's defeat as Prime Minister only months after the war ended.  The changing world scene may have also served to shift the balance of their friendship.  Before WWII, the United States and England were two dominant world powers.  After the war, China and the Soviet Union replaced the British Empire as a major force.  I wonder if FDR would have treated Churchill in a diminished capacity as the fortunes of the British Empire waned.<br />I especially enjoyed the many stories and anecdotes about these two men.  Churchill, especially, can best be described as a character!  He was a heavy handed drinker and a demanding guest.  He loved to stay up late and seemed to do his best work after midnight.  Winston didn't like American whiskey or Roosevelt's nightly cocktails.  Both men had strong, intelligent wives, although Eleanor and Clementine didn't particularly like each other.  While Clementine couldn't keep up with Eleanor, Franklin had a difficult time matching Winston's energy and stamina.<br />All in all, Meacham has provided us with a very good sketch about two great men.as the fortunes of the British Empire waned.<br />I especially enjoyed the many stories and anecdotes about these two men.

Yes, there are various books on this same topic that are better written.  And at 160 or so pages, it is rather light.  But it deals with some universal themes that occur with any person who plays or coaches a sport.  Things like the fine line between love and hate for a coach.  Sometimes we hate coaches for the torture and discipline they put us through, but love the results and the fact that coaches push us to our limits.  Often times, coaches see things in us that we might not know we possess.  It's also surprising to find out at times that the coaches we revere as gods are actually human, after all.  It was also interesting to read the dynamics between the various players of different teams and different generations.  For some former athletes, playing on a championship team becomes the most defining moment of their lives.  On the minus side, I thought Grisham could have done a better job at character development.  Also, I'm a little skeptical of commercially successful authors who publish such short novels.  It's as if they're just putting something out there to meet a deadline.  Still, Bleachers has some redeeming qualities and it proves to be a quick but enjoyable read.	2003-12-10

Having just finished Robert Parker's Death in Paradise, I immediately picked up Perish Twice and thought I was reading the same book.  There are just way too many similarities between Jesse Stone (Death in Paradise) and PI Sunny Randall.  Both are divorced.  Both are still stuck on their ex's and meet them once a week for dinner. Both are quick with a comback, although Sunny has more interesting friends than Jesse Stone.  In both books, the plots are a bit lame and they resolve themselves a little too quickly.  Both are quick reads with way too much paper wasted between dozens of chapters (66 chapters in Death in Paradise vs. 58 in Perish Twice). You can read each book in only 90 minutes.  The only reason I gave it three stars is that Parker's dialogue is always first rate.  Otherwise, I wasn't much impressed with Perish Twice.	2003-11-26

Death in Paradise by Robert Parker is a very entertaining, but very light mystery.  We follow the exploits of Paradise chief of police, Jesse Stone, as he tries to solve a murder mystery, get his drinking under control and get his love life on track.  While Parker's dialogue is first rate, it seems to read more like a screenplay than a novel.  Also, the plot seems to resolve itself just a little too quickly.  My biggest complaint, however, is all the wasted paper.  With 1 to 1-1/2 blank pages between each chapter--and we're talking 66 chapters and almost 300 pages here, it's almost as if Parker tried to make a novella into something larger.  So for Parker fans, you'll enjoy this book but don't expect a deep, complicated or dramatic mystery.	2003-11-25

I was a little intimidated by The Correction by Jonathan Franzen, mainly because of the length.  But when I read that my favorite author, Pat Conroy, gave it rave reviews, I decided to give it a try.  I have to say that I was NOT disappointed!  You'll follow the lives of one of the most dysfunctional families ever, as their lives careen out of control--mostly through their own doing.  The characters are quirky, the plot is a page turner (even though nothing much seems to happen) and the writing style is superb.  But the thing I especially enjoyed were the observations about life and about relationships.  In this respect, The Correction reminded me of Richard Russo's Nobody's Fool and Empire Falls.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I felt the story got bogged down in certain sections.  But overall, I was pleasantly surprised and won't be so reluctant to read Franzen's next effort.	2003-11-25

If you look in the dictionary, you'll find a picture of King Edward VII illustrating the word &quot;cad.&quot;  In fact, you will also find him next to rogue, rake and bon vivant.  Well, not really--but he would be a perfect match!  In Edward the Caresser, Stanley Weintraub explores the life of Albert Edward, The Prince of Wales, who later becomes King Edward VII.  &quot;Bertie&quot; is perhaps one of the most colorful royals of the last 200 years.  The oldest son of Queen Victoria, Bertie is a disappointment from the time he is small, and it just continues throughout his adult life.  Because of her lack of confidence in Bertie, Victoria gives him very few royal responsibilities and he will come to the throne at age 59 with very little training.  The Prince of Wales uses all his free time to over-indulge in eating, drinking, smoking, gambling, hunting, traveling and most of all, women.  He associates with many upper-crust gentlemen of questionable character.  And he tends to go from one controversy to the next.  His name is dragged through the courts for a variety of offenses from gambling to divorce proceedings.  He is blackmailed on more than one occasion over indiscreet letters he has written to various women.  He has a number of illegitimate children and often stands as their godfather when they are christened.  He also gets himself into tremendous debt financing this opulent lifestyle.  But the people of England love the prince--mainly because he is personable and also, because he shows himself to his mothers' subjects: something the Queen stopped doing after the death of her consort.  Bertie is definitely a charmer, and as he opens hospitals and plants trees, the British come to forgive him his indiscretions.<br />One of the things I found most fascinating is comparing the life of this Prince of Wales with that of Charles, the present Prince of Wales.  Although a full century separates them, they are made from the same cloth.  Both men have spent the majority of their lives in the role of Prince of Wales.  Both their mothers are long livers, and they've had to go through life doing inane jobs waiting to become king.  They were both married to beautiful women who were adored the world over, and both cheated on their brides.  At least Charles hasn't had a stable of mistresses (unlike Bertie), but ironically, the present prince must have assumed he was still living in Victorian society when it was perfectly fine to remain married to your wife and have a mistress, also.  There is also irony in that one of Bertie's favorites, Alice Keppel, was the great-grandmother of Charles' current squeeze, Camilla Parker Bowles.  Charles has also gotten himself into his fair share of controversy over the years, and we are left to wonder whether he will ever reign as king. (These comparisons are mine only, and are not made by the author in this book).<br />In terms of the book itself, I became a little bored when Weintraub went into great detail about the Prince's Indian expedition and got tired of reading the details about what he bagged on each hunt.  Weintraub also has a disturbing habit of alternating between proper names and titles when mentioning various individuals.  For instance, he sometimes mentions Benjamin Disraeli and sometimes Lord Beaconsfield (they are one in the same).  It gets very confusing with less well-known individuals.  I also think that the author does not do just to Bertie's wife, Alexandra.<br />All in all, Edward the Caresser is an enjoyable read.

US	53052945	R314JWO3QMLPTN	0312244967	276400422	Victoria's Daughters	Books	4	13	13	N	Y	Fascinating read...	For anyone interested in reading about Queen Victoria and/or the British Royal Family, Victoria's Daughters by Jerrold Packard is sure to please.  When a monarch rules as long and as prominently as Victoria, most books limit themselves to the highlights (or low points) of her reign.  And considering that she had nine chileren, all of whom lived to adulthood (a rarity for Victorian times), it is only natural that we really find out very little about them in most biographies.  So Victoria's Daughers gives us great details about their lives, thier personalities and especially, their relationship with their famous mother.<br />Vicky is probably the most well-known of the daughters as she became Empress of Prussia and produced the obnoxious and overbearing Kaiser Wilhem.  Next comes Alice, who married Louis of Hesse.  Alice was nurturing, religious and was responsible for improving the quality of medical care in Germany.  She was also the mother of the ill-fated Tsarina Alexandra.  Helena was the dowdy, dull daughter but managed to find a husband who was well suited to her and had the longest and happiest marriage.  Louise was the most beautiful daughter.  She was an artist and also a rebel.  She was the only one to marry a commoner and also, was the only daughter to remain childless.  Baby Beatrice was the daughter expected to sacrifice her adulthood to care for the Queen.  When Beatrice finally fell in love at the late age of 28, it took a 6 month battle before Victoria would allow her youngest child to marry--and only on the condition that Beatrice and her husband make their home with Victoria.  There was such an age difference between the children that when Vicky (the oldest) got married, Beatrice (the youngest) was still a baby.<br />This book is filled with many stories and anecdotes about growing up in Victorian society and under Victoria's influence.  We learn that Albert, Prince Consort, was actually the better parent while the children were young.  He spent countless hours tutoring Vicky and Alice in the skills and knowledge they needed to be first ladies in their new homelands.  Ironically, neither Albert nor Victoria thought to prepare Bertie, their oldest son and heir to the throne, for the tremendous responsibilities he would face as King Edward VII.  Victoria insisted that her daughters write to her daily and continued to try and influence them throughout their lives.  She thought breastfeeding babies was common and vulgar, and was highly upset when she discovered that Alice and Vicky were both breastfeeding their children.  Not only did Victoria employ wetnurses for this job, but insisted that these nurses stand while feeding her children--in deference to their royal status!  When Vicky and Alice complained to their mother about customs in their adopted lands, Victoria urged them to continue doing things the English way (not something that endeared them to their new subjects).  Even when Vicky became Empress of Prussia, Victoria considered her a British princess first and foremost.  We also read about the trials and tribulations these daughters faced knowing they might be carriers of that dreaded disease, hemophilia.  Alice and Beatrice ended up being carriers, while brother Leopold suffered from the disease.  Finally, we read about the large number of grandchildren of Queen Victoria (40 in all) and the many problems associated with them.  She was much more patient, understanding and loving to her grandchildren than she was to her own children.  Many of this generation became rulers in their own right including King George V, Kaiser Wilhem, Tsarina Alexandra, Queen Ena of Spain, Queen Marie of Romania, Queen Sophie of Greece and Queen Maud of Norway.  No wonder she is considering the Grandmother of Europe.<br /> There are some minor flaws in this book that prove to be distractions.  First, Packard repeats himself over and over again.  He keeps telling us that Victoria and Alice were estranged, but yet never really gives us concrete evidence of this.  He also relates how the marriage between Alice and Louis was very unfulfilling to Alice, yet she continued to love him dearly (?).  I think Packard should have presented the facts without trying to make assumptions.  There were also quite a few typos and I wonder where the editor (or proof reader) was on this.  Finally, I think the author could have done a better job selecting photographs and perhaps, had more of them.  All in all, I think it was a good book that could have been a little better.ives us concrete evidence of this.

The main character is ne'er-do-well Donald Sullivan.  &quot;Sully&quot; drinks and smokes too much and eats and sleeps too little.  He is too stubborn for his own good, and can always be depended on to make the wrong decisions.  He rarely does well by the people in his life including his ex-wife, his son, his girlfriend, his best friend or his lawyer.  He grew up with an abusive father who still haunts him despite the fact that he died a few years back.  Despite all this, you can't help falling in love with Sully, and even though his life seems totally out of control, you can't help but feeling that Sully is enjoying life in spite of himself.<br />Russo's book does not contain high drama, but you will be entertained by the comical antics and quirky characters of this small, depressed town in upstate New York.  The characters and dialogue are always real and always first rate.  And despite an inherent sadness about the hopelessness of North Bath and Sully's plight, there are enough comical scenes to keep you chuckling throughout.  And there's always the expectation that things might just work out for the best.  Richard Russo has jumped onto my favorite author list to join Pat Conroy and Larry McMurtry.	2003-10-13

Princess Alice of Greece is one of the most fascinating of all the royals, but unfortunately, the least known.  Perhaps the British Royal Family has kept the lid on this biography because of embarrassment?  But Hugo Vickers tells this long repressed story in Alice: Princess Andrew of Greece.<br />Alice was born when royalty was at its zenith, and she was surrounded by some of the most important personalities of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Her great-grandmother was Queen Victoria.  Her father was Louis of Battenberg, First Sea Lord and her brother was Dickie Mountbatten, Last Viceroy of India.  Alice's sister Louise became Queen of Sweden, and her mother's sister was Tsarina Alexandra.  Alice's youngest child and only son is Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and husband to Queen Elizabeth II.<br />Alice topped an idyllic childhood by marrying Prince Andrew of Greece.  In a day when most marriages were arranged, this was a love match.  There was no familial opposition as Alice was from a morganatic marriage and her groom the 4th son of King George I of Greece.  Unfortunately, her married life was marred by sadness, heartbreak and tragedy.  The Greek monarchy and the Greek government were as unstable as the weather.  On numerous occasions, Alice had to flee Greece with her family for extended periods of time.  She lived through two world wars where a good many of her relatives were on the German (enemy) side including her sons-in-law.  Her father-in-law was assassinated by a disgruntled Greek, and dozens of Russian relatives, including aunt Tsarina Alexandra and her entire family, were murdered during the Russian Revolution.  A plane crash in England in 1937 took the lives of one daughter, son-in-law, two grandchildren, and a Hessian aunt. Perhaps as a result of these many setbacks, Alice succumbed to schizophrenia and had to be institutionalized for a good many years.  The story of Alice's subsequent recovery, her conversion to orthodoxy, her becoming a nun and establishing a religious order make for a fascinating saga.<br />Unfortunately, this book is not without some major flaws.  First, Vickers writing style leaves a lot to be desired and his run-on sentences are a big distraction.  One example can be found on page 77: \\"Presently the whole party moved to Buckingham Palace, attending a ball at the Russian Embassy and the King's Birthday Parade, in which Andrea [Andrew] rode to Horseguards Parade in the procession directly behind the King, little realizing that this would one day be the annual duty of his yet unborn son.\\"  The many footnotes (sometimes 3 or 4 per page) are very tiresome and provide more information than we really need.  I have no clue how someone could read this book for a book-on-tape.  Also, the author could do a better job identifying Russian Royalty.  Most Russians are identified by their first name, followed by a patronymic (their father's name followed by \\"ovich\\").  For instance, the tsar's name was Nicholas Alexandrovich (Nicholas, son of Alexander).  Vickers doesn't follow this rule and when he names a Grand Duke Michael, it is often difficult to know which of the dozen or so Grand Duke Michael's he is referring to.<br />Still, Alice is an interesting book and it was not an easy story to write, as Alice destroyed most of her papers and letters throughout her lifetime.  It also includes many never before seen photos of Alice and her extended family, including a poignant photo of her processing in her nun's habit for the coronation of her daughter-in-law.

This is the second Diane Mott Davidson that I have read, and although it is light and fluffy and entertaining, we're not talking great fiction or even great mystery here.  Davidson is one of the many mystery writers nowadays who has come upon a theme, and her theme is food.  The main character, Goldy Bear, is a caterer and while she's running around solving crimes, she's also cooking up a storm. Three things kept me from giving this book more stars. First, the plot is rather hokey and it's hard to believe that after Goldy's fiance' is kidnapped just minutes before her wedding, that in the three days following, she would take on last minute catering jobs.  Also, Goldy never listens to the police and always tries to solve things on her own (makes you wonder why she hasn't been killed).  Second, I'm a devout Episcopalian and while I usually enjoy books with Episcopal themes, the complicated jargon of the Episcopal Church even got tiring to me after awhile.  Most non-Episcopalians would be hard pressed to give definitions of narthex or ambry.  Finally, as someone who likes to cook and entertains quite a bit, I found that the dozen or so recipes that are included in this book didn't even appear appetizing (except for maybe the cinnamon buns).  Anyway, I will admit that I was anxious to keep turning pages to see who the villain was in this book.  But overall, I don't think it is one of Davidson's better efforts.	2003-09-14

While I enjoyed this book by Dashiell Hammett's daughter, Josephine, it was not quite what I expected. I purchased Dashiell Hammett: A Daughter Remembers thinking that it was going to be an in-depth biography about Dashiell Hammett.  Instead, it is a short book filled with remembrances of her dad that are short snippets and stories and anecdotes.  While the book is filled with many wonderful photos, the story skips around a bit and Jo Hammett doesn't delve into any one topic (early years, married life, Lillian Hellman, service years, prision time, etc.) in any great detail.  Still, Hammett was a very fascinating character and his daughter tries to give us just a little insight into the real man.  She also tries to separate some of the Hammett-myth that was created and perpetuated by long-time friend and lover, Lillian Hellman.  While I enjoyed the things that I read, I just wish there had been more.	2003-09-14

Penalty, which can best be described as horrid.  I couldn't believe that someone as prolific as Dick Francis could sell so many books if they were of this caliber.  This summer, my same friend gave me a big bag of mysteries to read, and I planned to skip Whip Hand.  But as luck would have it, I ran out of books before I ran out of summer and Whip Hand was the only one left.  Was I pleasantly surprised!  In fact, this turned out to be the best mystery I have read all summer.  The main character is Sid Halley, an ex-jockey turned PI whose small stature belies all the hidden baggage beneath.  He also brings the same passion to win that he had as a jockey to his investigations.  Halley has three separate mysteries dumped on him: a mail fraud, a syndicate fixing and racehorse tampering.  The racehorse tampering was especially timely after spending some time in Versailles Kentucky this summer, site of the tragic and still unsolved horse tampering case.  Not to give the story away, but this book is filled with action, drama, suspense, believable characters, just a little romance, and a plot that will have you guessing until the very end.

N & A ends with the execution of Nicholas and his family, but we discover in The Final Chapter that much has happened since the original was published in 1967.  Lots of new information has become available due to perestroika, the fall of the Soviet Union, the opning of many long-sealed records and archives, and a renewed interest in the monarchy.  All of these changes make us realize that there are many more chapters to the Romanov story, and this book is filled with mystery, tragedy, science, bickering, intrique, and above all, a profound sadness.<br />We read about the discovery of the Romanov remains and how and why this was kept secret for so long.  We learn about the DNA testing to determine the authenticity of the remains and the subsequent fighting over that. Of course, there is the problem of the two missing skeletons and the controversy this causes.  We are introduced to a number of Romanov imposters including Anna Anderson.  We learn about the fates of the true surviving Romanov's and their battle over who should be claimant to the throne.  We also are informed of the destruction of the Ipatiev House by Brezhnev so that it wouldn't become a monarchist shrine.  And finally, we hear about the rumors of a vast Romanov fortune that is supposed to be in foreign banks and has never been found.<br />Since this book has been published, the Romanov remains have finally been reburied in St. Petersburg.  But even this could not be accomplished without the bickering of the surviving Romanov's (as characterized in The Final Chapter).  Some of them even boycotted the event.  It is not always a pretty story.<br />The Final Chapter is also filled with fascinating tidbits of information.  For instance, Prince Philip (husband of Queen Elizabeth) provided blood samples for DNA analysis as his grandmother was the Empress Alexandra's older sister.<br />All in all, this is a fabulous  book!  Those who expect this to be a boring, dry history will be pleasantly surprised.  No author has told the Romanov story with as much style, passion and completeness as Robert Massie.  It is no wonder that the story of Nicholas and Alexandra refuses to die, and why new generations of readers become enthralled with this tragic story--even 85 years after their deaths.dmother was the Empress Alexandra's older sister.<br />All in all, this is a fabulous  book!

Weighing in at 110 pages (171 counting index, sources, and notes), this book is a fascinating account of Susan Pringle Frost and her firm hand in the creation of the preservation movement in Charleston, South Carolina.  To understand this story, one must know a little history of Charleston.  Once one of the richest and most beautiful cities in the country, Charleston took a devastating downturn after the Civil War.  So when ravaged by fire, hurricanes and even a destructive earthquake, Charlestonians did not have the money to raze and rebuild like many others cities (including Richmond and Atlanta).  Instead, they had to restore.  As a result, the turn of the century saw many of Charleston's historic buildings still intact but needing lots of work.<br />Enter Miss Susan Pringle Frost.  Born in 1873 to a very old Charleston family that became impoverished after the Civil War, Pringle Frost was a woman way ahead of her time.  She was able break away from the ties that bound traditional Victorian women and to move into a more modern age.  Having never married, she first went to work as a court stenographer in 1901--a time when women weren't accepted into the workplace.  She eventually went into real estate and became the first woman realtor in Charleston.  She was a firm believer in civil rights when it was an unpopular stand in the south.  She got involved in the suffrage movement, and hitched her star to Alice Paul.  The skills that she learned during the suffrage battles, she used to great effect to get the preservation movement started.  She badgered public officials, she recruited followers, she begged loans from bankers, and she was the key motivator in founding the Preservation Society of Charleston--still the premier preservation society in the city.  Even before the PSC was founded, she single-handedly contributed to preservation efforts by purchasing run down homes in once properous neighborhoods and restoring them at her own expense.  When the city wanted to tear down the homes that make up the now famous Rainbow Row and build something modern, Miss Susan purchased six of them and saved the entire block from the wrecking ball.  Without Pringle Frost, Charleston would not be the charming city that attracts millions of tourists each year.  Her contributions to the city of Charleston are so very impressive and author Sidney Bland does a fine job of bringing this story to life.on efforts by purchasing run down homes in once properous neighborhoods and restoring them at her own expense.

The characters seem flat and shallow, although maybe you have to read from the beginning of the Paul Madriani series to get more background on recurring characters.  The writing seems rather bland and dry.  Some parts were very predictable and I figured out the villan halfway through the book (something I don't usually do).  The first half of the book showed great promise, and then proceeded to sink with each successive page.  The plot was very convoluted, and even at the end when things were somewhat explained, it still seemed totally unbelievable.  Too many questions were left unanswered and the entire plot didn't make sense.  As someone who reads dozens and dozens of mysteries every year, I wasn't impressed with Mr. Martini.	2003-08-23

When I first saw that this book was published, I was skeptical that enough information could be gathered about Queen Victoria's death to make for interesting reading. Was I wrong! The Last Days of Glory: The Death of Queen Victoria by Tony Rennell contains not just lots of interesting information, but also all the high drama required of a good Victorian novel.  The cast of characters is unbelievable.  They include:  1. a robust queen whose rapidly failing health is kept from her public until the last minute 2. a reluctant heir who would rather go fox hunting and spend time with his mistresses than attend his mother's deathbed or assume the throne  3. a passel of children and grandchildren who hover about and argue with each other 4. an obnoxious, arrogant and overbearing grandson (Kaiser William II) trying to make nice with his British cousins (who all loathe him) while trying to muscle his way into the death scene  5. a personal doctor who is second guessed at every opportunity, is never allowed to physically examine the queen and who serves as a spy to the Kaiser  6. a bishop who tries to interject too much &quot;churchiness&quot; into the death scene and is finally asked to leave  7. a head dresser who has promised the queen to sneak a large number of objects and mementos into the queen's coffin (without her family's knowledge) including several from the queen's devoted Scottish servant, John Brown (also rumored to be her secret husband) 8. a large number of heads of state who scheme and plot and politic against each other at the funeral, even though most of them are related to each other 9. an Empire of British subjects who have never known another sovereign and 10. a large group of faithful but bumbling government officials who have no clue how to bury the old monarch or install the new one because they haven't had to worry about such things for over 63 years.<br />Add to this story a lost effigy for the burial sarcophagus and over 100 daily newspapers scrapping for every little tidbit of information, and you have a saga most fiction writers could only dream about.  To make the story even more interesting, we learn about the changes in the Empire and the world during the course of Victoria's reign.  Telegrams have revolutionized communication, telephones are in their infancy, and no one really believes that the new horseless carraiges will become popular because they're too expensive.  Queen Victoria's death takes place at the dawn of a new millennium, so the end of the 19th Century and the end of the Victorian Era occur together.  Also, the British Empire will never again be as great or as grand as it was during Victoria's reign. It all makes for fascinating reading.<br />The only flaw I could find in The Last Dayas of Glory involved a historical fact.  The Russian Tsar and Tsarina, Nicholas and Alexandra (Victoria's favorite granddaughter) got married after Nicholas became tsar and not before.  But other than this minor error, I find no fault here.

I am a recent convert to Janet Evanovich and read her previous 8 Stephanie Plum books in a span of about 4 months.

But with To the Nines, Janet AND Stephanie are at their peaks!  Of course, we have the usual zany cast of characters including Stephanie, LuLu, Connie, Vinnie, Joe Morelli, Ranger, Grandmom Mazur and the rest.  Add to that a very pregnant sister, a crazy webmaster, a trip to Las Vegas, a guy on a visa bond who vanishes, the usual love triangle, a fluffy dog and lots of dead bodies, and you have Evanovich at her best.  I usually read mysteries because I find them interesting and like to learn something (Tony Hillerman comes to mind).  But I read Evanovich solely for enjoyment--you will split your sides laughing and have tears rolling down your cheeks.  They're that good!	2003-08-11

Unfortunately, Clint Eastwood butchered the movie and cheated movie-goers out of the true flavor of the book.  Just last week, my husband and I listened to the book on tape and it was just as good--if not better, the second time around.  How good was it?  Well, our trip took us 14 hours in the car and we were tempted to sit in the car when we arrived home so that we could hear the end of the book!  It was that riveting.  Baldacci is definitely the best of the lawyer-turned-writers.  His stories are action-packed, his characters are well fleshed out and believable, and his plots of full of suspense.  For my money, give me Baldacci over that &quot;other&quot; lawyer anyday.	2003-08-05

Pat Conroy's My Losing Season is surely one of the best books I've read this year.  I was a little hesitant about reading this non-fiction book about his senior season playing basketball at The Citadel, but found that this should not keep readers away. First, Conroy fleshes out the trials and tribulations of his turbulent childhood with his abusive father, and we realize that all his fiction (The Great Santini, The Prince of Tides, etc.) is more factual than one expected.  It's also sad to see Conroy as a boy trying unsuccessfully to reach out to his father through basketball, but the scars that result from his father's rejection are what helped to make Conroy such a masterful storyteller.  Conroy once said that the greatest gift than any writer can receive is to be born into a dysfunctional family.  It is also interesting to read about college basketball in the late 1960's.  This was a period of time when southern colleges were still pretty much segregated and when players still did underhand foul shots.  Still, don't let all the basketball intimidate you.  The first time I read this book, the development of Pat as a basketball player was my primary focus.  But several months later, I listened to this book on tape and I was more tuned in to the development of Conroy as a writer.  Conroy truly is an artist and this book will make you laugh, it will make you cry, and it will make you want to read more of this talented writer.	2003-06-23

As with most Hillerman mysteries, this book follows the same formula.  First, a crime has occurred on Native American lands due to the exploitation of Native American resources.  Jim Chee and Joe Leaphorn again work together to solve a crime, although they seem to be less adversarial with each book.  Both characters have budding romantic interests, although things are still unresolved at the end.  Ineffective FBI agents still try to wrestle control of criminal investigations from the Tribal Police.  And the Tribal Police still try to do their jobs within the parameters of their Indian (mostly Navajo) beliefs.  Hillerman's mysteries are fascinating in that they educate the reader about Native American cultures, lands, life on the reservation, religious beliefs and a host of other topics.  However, I would recommend that a reader new to Hillerman skip this book for now, and start with his earliest mysteries which give more background into Native American beliefs and vocabulary.  It will also be helpful in that the personal lives of his characters continue to develop in each novel.  Still, The Wailing Wind is an entertaining mystery for Hillerman fans and I found it much better than his last effort.	2003-06-23

The Hidden Campaign by Hugh Evans is a very disturbing book.  The goal of The Hidden Campaign is to investigate the cover-up that occurred among the doctors of Franklin Roosevelt to keep his serious health problems from the American people--especially during his campaign for a 4th term in office. The book raises many questions including:  1. Why was ENT (ear nose and throat) specialist Vice Admiral Ross McIntyre allowed to serve as FDR's primary physician?  2. Why didn't McIntyre treat FDR for chronic hypertension when it first appeared in 1937?  3. Why was FDR or his family never notified that he had congestive heart failure in 1944?  4. When a cardiologist was finally called in, why were his recommendations not followed?  5. Why didn't FDR's doctors tell him that he probably wouldn't survive a fourth term?  This book tries to answer these questions and many more. It is obvious that FDR's life was sacrificed for the sake of the war effort, the nation and perhaps even for the benefit of his cronies.<br />Ross McIntyre is definitely the villain in this story, although Evans never really tells the reader who was calling the shots here.  Even years after FDR's death, McIntyre was still trying to perpetuate the lies that FDR suffered from nothing more serious than bronchitis and sinusitis, and that his death took his doctors by complete surprise.<br />While I found this story fascinating, two things kept me from giving it five stars.  First, parts of it read like a doctoral dissertation with actuarial charts of life expectancy of presidents, parents of presidents, FDR's children, vice presidents and cabinet members.  Medical records in the appendix contain medical jargon that will not be understood by a novice.  Second, at only 134 pages for the body of this book, I thought it was a little light.  Still, it is an eye-opening story that shows how the life of perhaps the greatest leader in the 20th century was sacrificed (without his knowledge) on the whim of his doctors.  This cover-up truly ended up being a tragedy for us all.This cover-up truly ended up being a tragedy for us all.	2003-06-07
US	53052945	R3DO0012497B15	0962536830	920991568	The President as Architect : Franklin D. Roosevelt's Top Cottage	Books	4	10	11	N	Y	Top Cottage is not quite top form...	Being a lover of all things Roosevelt, I was thrilled to discover that not only is FDR's Top Cottage in Hyde Park open to the public, but that there is now even a book on this fascinating structure.  FDR built Top Cottage as an answer to Eleanor's Val-Kill cottage, as a hideaway from the craziness of his mother's \\"big house\\" and as a place to retire.  Sara Roosevelt was very opposed to this project and is rumored to have made FDR promise he would never spend the night there as long as she was alive.  He apparently honored this commitment and never slept there overnight, even though she predeceased him by three years.<br />This house is fascinating for several reasons.  First, it was designed by Roosevelt himself, with some help from architect Henry Toombs.  This is perhaps the first house designed by a president since Jefferson's Poplar Forrest.  It also has a barrier-free design for a wheelchair bound inividual--something unheard of in the 1930's.  And with the exception of the Little White House is Warm Springs, Georgia, it was entirely his to decorate as he saw fit.  Mother and wife had no influence here.  FDR was able to use Top Cottage to escape, to entertain friends, and to even host royal dignitaries and important guests.  Unfortunately, we know that he never lived out his dream to retire there.<br />When I ordered this book, based on the price and the description, I expected something of a coffee table-type book.  In this regard, it is less than I expected.  When the house was purchased in 1997 and before restoration took place, a \\"historic structure report\\" was completed.  This report is the basis for the book.  There are many photographs and drawings, although many are just variations on floor plans.  All the photos are black and white.  There are several interior pictures from the FDR years, but not nearly enough.  One chapter details every room--walls, ceilings, baseboards, appliances, etc.  Another lists everything that needed to be done to each and every room.  This doesn't exactly make for riveting reading.  The few interior pictures after the restoration show only empty rooms, and the reader is left wondering whether the cottage has been furnished or not.<br />Still, there is much information to be gleamed from this book for readers who are fascinated by the Roosevelt's.  The story of the planning and construction of this dwelling is very informative, as well as how the cottage was used once constructed.  This book also details the history of the cottage from the time of FDR's death until it was purchased for historic purposes in 1997.  The author also goes into great depth about all the work that had to be done to restore the cottage to vintage FDR.  While any Roosevelt fan will enjoy this book, it is a little rough going for a novice.  Also, I thought the ... price tag a little steep.

How incredible that a first time author should hit a grand slam on his first at bat!  And as with any grand slam, Shawn McBride touches all the bases.  This book is hilarious, sad, poignant, touching and always refreshing.  We quickly fall in love with the hero of this book, Henry Toohey.  Henry is a typical 13 year old--he tries to be cool, agonizes over his hair, hangs out with his buddies, loves sports, describes every woman by her cup size, worries about his dysfunctional family and is in love with a neighborhood girl.  Henry also possesses a heart of gold and a garbage mouth.  We follow Henry through three days of late summer as he hatches a plan to propose marriage to his girlfriend and at the same time, save his sorry family from themselves.  He is a naive romantic who believes in \\"happily ever after.\\"  Although Henry's scheme doesn't go as planned, the end results are satisfying and touching nonetheless.  The events in these three short days also prove to have a maturing influence on the young Henry and he ends the book much closer to manhood than at the beginning.<br />Although the book itself was thoroughly enjoyable, it was made even more so for those of us who recognize the neighborhoods, the parks, the churches, the neighborhood games (stickball and freedom), the sports teams and the houses complete with statues of assorted saints.  It was also nice that this book was published first in paperback, thus making it more affordable for the average reader.  I gave a number of them as gifts for Easter--something I couldn't have done if they were hardbacks.<br />So, to Mr. McBride, congratulations and here's hoping that this is just the beginning of a long and distinguished literary career.  It is truly a delight to read a new, fresh and young voice in the publishing world.voice in the publishing world.	2003-05-14

This was my first book by John Jakes and I found it quite enjoyable.  Yes, the story was light and fluffy in some spots and sappy and melodramatic in others. Yet, it still covered many heavy topics including the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, the division of families over these wars, the horrors of slavery, the abololitionist movement, the destruction of the way of life for the Charleston elite, and the rebuilding of the city.  I found it to be a real page turner and couldn't wait to get to the next chapter and the next to find out what happens.  My one major complaint about this book is that sometimes events seemed to take place out of order, and in several spots, the story doesn't follow the family trees in the front.  Also, as historical fiction, I don't think Jakes can compare with James Michener.  Still, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and can't wait to start North and South real soon.	2003-05-11

I wasn' t sure whether to love or hate the main character, Clay Carter.  It was hard to believe that after having such high work standards and low need requirements, that Carter would be so stupid as to get roped into such questionable schemes.  I thought the ending was especially weak.  Still, it was an eye opener into the world of sleaze-ball tort lawyers and I now understand why tort reform is such a hot topic with politicians.	2003-03-07

It is several chapters too long and we do get tired of Mayes' whining.  We have little pity for her trying to restore two houses at once and we don't need to hear about every meal and shopping excursion.  It certainly does not surpass her first effort, &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun.&quot;  Still, as someone who has never been to Tuscany (or Italy for that matter), many of the descriptions in &quot;Bella Tuscany&quot; are little treasures.  Who wouldn't want to live where you can go to one local farm for ricotta, another for pecorino romano and a third for wine?  Or where Roman and Etruscan ruins are to be found in so many unsuspecting places?  Or where fabulous meals can be made with only the simple ingredients you grow in your garden?  Or where every small local church has a major work or art or two?  I do have two recommendations that would have made this book more enjoyable; a map of Tuscany and Italy would have been helpful in identifying the many places Mayes visited.  Also, I would have enjoyed more photographs other than those on the dust jacket.  Maybe the few &quot;teaser&quot; pictures are to whet our appetite for her 3rd book, &quot;In Tuscany.&quot;  In any case, while this book has some character flaws, I think potential readers need to try to overlook these and to dig deeper for the jewel within.	2003-03-06

It was great to read about so many of the local spots we frequent (Grace Church, The Market, Magnolia's, Poogan's Porch, The Citadel Mall, etc.). Unfortunately, the mystery was extremely trite.  Halfway through, I had more than enough of many of the obnoxious characters including C.J. and Momma.  The entire tale was totally unbelievable.

I have at least 100 different books about the Romanovs in my personal library, and I have to say that this is the bottom of the barrel.  The writing is trite, the research is flawed, and there are so many inaccuracies that I question this book being called non-fiction.  There were so many things Sullivan could have developed in greater depth--especially the relationship between Victoria and her sister.  Of course, Ducky was such a shallow individual that I imagine it must have been difficult to write a biography about her.  Past reviewers seemed to either love or hate this book.  I suspect that the raves came from Sullivan's friends.  Any historian familiar with Romanov history will identify this book for what it is--a very flawed attempt to make a minor character in Russian/German/English history into a major one.	2002-10-20

I found this book terribly confusing with the story jumping around between past and present and the assortment of characters.  I thought that the character of Charlie Taft was very undeveloped and that he should develop a &quot;passion&quot; for the dead Imogene rather laughable.  I could not understand why people had such sympathy for George Remus and was disappointed by the ending.  Any book that I start, I force myself to finish.  Many times I'm surprised halfway through.  But I now wish I had bailed out on this book after a couple of chapters.  It wasn't worth the time.  I read in Holden's notes that he had two editors for this book.  Perhaps that was a big part of the problem.  This will certainly be my first and last Holden.	2002-10-20

The characters were whiney and insipid and the plot was very slow to develop.  After wading through this book hoping things would imrpove, the ending was a complete bomb.  I haven't read many Patricia Cornwell books, but all that I have read were much better than Hornet's Nest.  Think I'll stick with Hillerman, Hiaasen, Grafton, Evanovich, P.D. James and Elizabeth George.	2002-06-25

Many previous readers have already given in-depth reviews on the particulars of this book (history of weather forecasting, hurricanes, Galveston, etc.).  What I found very lacking was the absence of photographs.  After reading this book and then checking out some web sites that showed pictures of Galveston after the storm, I had no idea how bad the city looked after being ravaged by this terrible disaster.  Larson himself mentions that the Galveston Library has over 4000 photographs pertaining to the storm.  It would have increased the reader's appreciation of the storm to have included at least a few of them.	2002-03-09

But I have to admit that I find this book a bit on the fluff side.  His observations, stories, and reminiscences were all rather interesting, but I thought that for the price of this book, there wasn't quite enough of them.  It's almost as if he's growing more and more prolific at the expense of substance (I feel very similarly about Crazy Horse).  The bang for the buck isn't to be found in this book.	2002-03-09
