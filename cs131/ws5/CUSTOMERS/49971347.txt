She was a fascinating woman of her age.  Devotedly religious, she found a life similiar in many respects to Mother Teresa of our age - although Miss Dix was much more effective using legislation as a tool in her relief work.  Her work with the mentally ill has been studied by many professionals in the field.  David Gollaher brings all the available historical documents together in an easy-to-read format for the general public.  I hope this book will be rereleased for a new generation of students, social workers, nurses and doctors.  Highly recommended for any public or private library.	2004-05-29

Each generation of thought stands on the shoulders of previous thought.<br />I highly recommend reading this book.

I am not a Catholic, but I have the utmost regard for what this man has accomplished.  The title of this book gives away the author's regard for him also.  The Americans give credit for the fall of communism to former Presidents Reagan and Gorbachev, especially in the video series 'Biography of the Millennium' done by A&amp;E, but without the Pope's knowledge of the Central Europeans it would have just been a dream of theirs.  I read this book with a great deal of relief that it had been published during the Pope's lifetime.  He would probably regard the historical oversight of his work with less frustration than many of his supporters.	2001-11-18

It explores such a new territory of philosophy in a true scientific fashion.  Its arguments are vitally important to the average person today.  If we have one day of our time to donate to alleviate suffering, do we?  If we have $100 of our money to donate to alleviate pain, do we? And who do we donate our time and money to?  Does the average person read stories of hunger and starvation in other countries, or do we tend to turn our attention to the divorces of movie stars?  The Western world likes to pride itself on moral responsibility, and some have what is referred to as 'compassion fatigue'.  Jamie Mayerfeld wants to measure the degree of suffering of each individual, as possibly an effort to ensure that our own compassion is divided accordingly.<br />This book is a technical read for those who will attempt it, but it is worth the effort of those who care enough to wonder if their compassion is truly being delivered to the one person most in need.	2001-08-11

As you read this insightful book, it is good to keep this in mind.  He had a neighbor's perspective of Winston Churchill and (although centuries separate their lives) of Isaac Newton.  These essays were the most valuable of the entire book.  These men were two of the most influential men that the world has ever produced.  With the knowledge of their exquisite gifts, emotionally both of these men had to conduct their lives.  Churchill's 'black dog' makes us wonder if today he would have been able to hold a powerful public office, with society's fear of mental illness.  Storr documents much of Churchill's emotional life and discusses Newton's also, which is very valuable to the reader.  This book was written by one of the most prominent psychiatrists of the 20th Century, who in the same vein as the neurologist Oliver Sacks, fortunately decided to expand his career by publishing books.	2001-06-28

Americans have so much, and it is hard for us to imagine the degree of poverty in other third-world countries.  Rose Ericson begins to introduce the subject of what fair trade means to these nations.  To us it is only a $1 sometimes, but that $1 in a poor nation can supply food for a day to an entire family.  In our hurry to accumulate material goods, we must be careful to not take advantage of the artisans and producers of these third-world nations.  Fair trade is a concept whose time has come.	2001-06-28

The authors have clearly been involved with the movement for long enough to realize many of its strengths and weaknesses.  They also know that it needs to be shaped to meet the demands of young women today, while at the same time addressing the needs of older women.  They discuss the issue of abortion, which alienates many women who would otherwise consider themselves feminists.  MANIFESTA is a book for men to read also.  It helps them to understand the daily struggles in life women are facing.  Although the authors are living in more cosmopolitan areas than most women, men and women will learn from this book.  I hope this effort by Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards will inspire many young women to write books on what feminism means to them, too.  I believe only then will the older generation of feminist really understand the revolution that has occurred.	2001-06-15

Nowhere to go, the homeless mentally ill have drifted in and out of hospitals since deinstitutionalization.  And the problem is getting worse in many states, not better.  When Fuller Torrey wrote this desperate plea, he wanted society to see the plight of the chronically mentally ill.  Today many persons want to forget that the mentally ill need supportive homes, as do those with advanced Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.  Maybe those with schizophrenia or severe manic depression have not been able to contribute as much to the workings of our modern day society, but they need nursing care as Fuller Torrey outlines in this book.  Why won't we as a society see this, he asks?  He himself was confronted with the tragedy of mental illness within his own family, so he understands the level of care that is needed to do the job right.  A classic discussion that I recommend for any public or private library.	2001-06-07

While every woman will not agree with all of Gloria Steinem's views, this book has become a classic.  It addresses a fundamental problem in the female life cycle.  The author has developed a clear insight into her own inner struggles, and has a remarkable ability of introspection.  One may have the genes, the education, the financial security, and many other advantages in life, but if a woman is lacking in self-esteem their talents are wasted.  The author has seen if happen among women, and obviously felt compelled enough to write a book about the problem.  Gloria Steinem is a voice, one voice, but what a voice!	2001-06-06

She is a recent winner of the National Medal of Science, and a great thinker in the fields of medicine and philosophy of medicine.  The book is written for the general public so they will become part of the great revolution of knowledge in the neurosciences.  She details not only traditional psychiatric illnesses, but expands this view into the neurological illnesses.  This is important as now psychiatry and neurology begin to merge, each developing a new respect for the field of the other.  She details how psychiatry cannot solve all of our modern day society's woes, but must turn these over to individuals to seek answers.

It in its own way has moved mountains of ignorance.  It brought life to not only the patients in the book, but millions of neurologically impared patients in the world.  It explained, along with the great movie 'Awakenings', how one could live but not really have complete life.  This is a tragedy the medical profession must continue to confront with better research and treatment.  Oliver Sacks originally wanted to be a researcher, but it was not in his destiny.  What he became, as documented in this book, was a unique facilitator of science.  He became a truly unique being that has blessed our humanity.	2001-05-14
