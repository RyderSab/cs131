Not a whole lot really happens.  Reading it and coming to the end, I realized that Jordan realized that he had a fantasy franchise on his hands and was going to milk it for all it was worth.  Don't get me wrong the book is well written, there are some tense moments that get your blood racing.  But there is no big monumental event like the first three books ended with. Yes there is the big meeting of the Aiel, but since when is the climax of a fantasy novel a meeting.  The final two chapters pack in all the action or confronting multiple forsaken, which could have been built up more along the way.  There is the trolloc attacks on Emonds Field, and the rise of Perrin as a warrior leader among his hometown people.  However there are certain plot points that are beginning to wear on me: The Whitecloaks being so corrupt, yet none of them seeing that they are corrupt, the ever present fear of the Dragon and the One Power, and the fact that none of the 'good guys' can get it together and kill the 'bad guys'.  When you have beaten a forsaken, just kill them, don't wait for a trial, when you have pure evil at your fingertips ready to be killed, don't let it walk free.  I can see why most people I have talked to about this series give up around the fifth book. <br />T	2004-04-30

Mr. Pennick's insights are quick and concise.  This is ibe of the best instructional books I have ever read. The only advice I have to give is to take one tip at a time.  Pick one thing to work on, when you feel you have achieved what Mr. Pennick said, then move on to something new.  The tips are also sprinkled with tales of yesteryear and legends of the game. It is difficult to read this without wanting to put the book down and try each tip as it comes along, I would say read the book once, then go back and work on the things that made hte most sense to you.<br />T	2004-04-27

This book is a collection of observations of Mr. Rooney, observations that have been poorly researched in some cases (Stating that police officers have a arrest quota was one of the more laughable beliefs). The book is entertaining for a few pages, then Mr. Rooney's constantly whining voice started eating at my brain and I just got sick of the whole thing. If you are a real fan of Andy's 60 Minute spots, then this would probably interest you.   I, however, was nauseated by the constant bitching of a man who has more than most could ever hope to have.  <br />T	2004-03-30

A collection of Op-Ed pieces, speeches givin, short family tree and some things that had no where else to go.  As a fan of Kurt, I own most of his books, and I had this one for 3 years before I read it because I wanted to read more of his fiction before I found out about the man.  Some of the articles mention his past novels and it is helpful to have read them to get a true understanding of what he is talking about. It was refreshing to see that Kurt believes the worst book he ahs written is Slapstick, he gives it a D.  I never liked that book, and now I feel like it is OK to not like it.  All in all this is no more than a short attention span book that will fill 5 minutes here or there.  If you have just a passing interest in Vonnegut, do not bother with this book.  However if you are a big Vonnegut fan like me, you might want to pick this up and get a little insight into his warped mind.<br />T	2004-03-26

Unlike most series out there, it makes no difference which order you read these in.  Just a collection of stories of people who are too stupid to be alive, and aren't. However, one glaring flaw in this book is the constant listings of tales that are &quot;unconfirmed by Darwin&quot;. If the story is unconfirmed, essentially meaning it is untrue, why put it in a book of &quot;true stories&quot;.  A few of these false Darwin's would be OK, but this book is nearly half full of these falsehoods.  It was a little disappointing.  However, it is amusing to read the tales and imagine what kind of morons would partake in such activities.  Really you could read any of the books in this series; they are essentially the same, so if you have a choice between the 3 (so far) pick the cheapest. <br />T	2004-02-28

In that time I was surprised to see how graphic and violent the novel was. Most fantasy books I have read simply gloss over the fact that people die. Brooks makes sure you know that there was a loss and you feel it more.  Another refreshing change was one of the main characters dies. I did not want to see the character pass, but it was nice to see that sometimes heroes fail. After being halfway through this book, I started looking at the Shannara series to see which \\"Trilogy\\" I should read next and I found out that this book contains a spoiler in reference to the Heritage of Shannnara series. Oops. I guess I will have to just act surprised.  All in all I would recommend this book to any fan of fantasy, It was truly enjoyable.	2004-02-05

I bought it for my 6th grader and read it to make sure it was \\"appropriate\\".  I find that for the most part it is, but it has its disturbing moments.  The illustrations in the novel definitely add to the unnerving nature of the book. The character of the other mother is not fully developed, but is a villain you can still root against.  Coraline is a fine, strong character.  The novel is also filled with trademark Gaiman off kilter humor.  I found it very enjoyable and would recommend it to most anyone.<br />T	2004-02-04

It is not. This is a collection of essays and speeches that DNA had given, with a few short stories. The short story titled the Salmon of Doubt is a Dirk Gently novel that does not have a firm ending, which is obviously because DNA died before he finished writing it. All in all there were some astute observations and some wonderfully comic moments from DNA. I would only recommend this book to true die hard friends of DNA.

While the title of this book may lead you to believe that this book is all about the inside of a newsroom.  That is not entirely true, but it is close.  Mr. Goldberg not only shows us why bias is apparent in the network news room he also picks certain topics(homeless, AIDS, man bashing...) and does a little investigative reporting of his own. I found all of the passages well written and they grabbed my interest. One thing to remember is that this book is not written by a right wing wacko. This is written by a democrat who never voted for Reagan or either Bush.  This is just a man who was sick of seeing the slant and the hypocrisy that goes along with it.

For those that have enjoyed the first two parts of this series, this book will not disappoint on most levels.  For the most part the book does not deal with the Dragon, but the people chasing the Dragon. The action is fast and exciting when it happens.  During the middle of the book Jordan chose to focus on one group for 230 pages. That is all well and good, but I found myself wanting to know what was happening to the other characters. The chapters did breeze by, all with logical ending and starting points, so the flow was definitely quick. I have heard bad things about the series after about book 5 or 6, people just begging for it to end, however I have not reached that point yet. I am still emotionally connected to all the main characters and would be not be happy to see them die, except maybe Nyneave and her damn tugging of her hair. OK OK I get it she tugs on her braid when she is nervous or angry. But does she have to do it in every chapter? Anyway, you should enjoy this journey into the Wheel of Time. Thanks T	2004-01-19

Gaiman skillfully created a fantastic world full of impossible possibilities.  From people keeping their life hidden to people falling through the cracks.  The banter between the arch villains Croup and Vandemar is so light and breezy you forget they are pure evil. The Marquis is a slick, likeable, fast talking charlatan. He is equal parts mischief and good and evil. You never know what to expect. Door and Richard are the main characters, and they are built flawlessly with Gaiman's narrative.  This is a very enjoyable novel.  I got this book because I enjoyed American Gods, I can safely say that this is Gaiman best effort at a Novel to date. <BR>T	2004-01-10

I started reading the book when I was 14 years old, I remembered being enthralled. As time passed and I have grown up, my opinions have changed. The tales told in this book are very formulmatic and childish. As I was finishing the book I would read aloud to my wife the most ridiculous passages just so I was not the only one who had to suffer. To a 12-14 year old fan of the Batman character, this would qualify as an interesting read, to a grown man who has distanced himself from the caped crusader, this is an awful collection.<BR>T	2004-01-09

Not having been a Tolkein aficionado, it was difficult at times to realize who was who in the narrative. After seeing the film by Peter Jackson, I was able to visualize, with greater ease, the cast of characters.  Overall the book is very good, filled with everything you would expect from a fantasy novel, because in essence Tolkein created the Fantasy novel. You have plenty of running and fighting and philosophy.  If you have only seen the film, and enjoyed it, you should read this book to fill in the cracks, it makes everything make more sense.

The cast of good characters pitted against almost insurmountable odds.  Against an evil presence that consumes and kills.  Pretty standard for a Stephen King Novel.  There are many references to the killings in this novel and many ways of death.  Again, typical of King. One thing that was not typical of King was the power and presence of God.  In this novel it is God's will that people survive and it is God's will that evil will lose.  The suspense is engrossing from the first page to the last.  You grow to feel for the characters and most of all you HATE the villain, the unformed entity TAK.  Most horror novels have a villain that you can't get behind and loathe.  There is no worry for that in this book, TAK is pure evil on paper and it is easy it hate it. Which makes the ending (which is a little predictable) more uplifting.  All in all this is a fine read which failed to get 5 stars only because I have read a few too many horror novels and could see cliches littering the pages.<br />Thanx for your time. T	2002-05-07

The difference in this one is that Arthur is finally starting to actually do things. rather than jsut standing around saying what.  In this one we get to see Arthur and trillian save the universe, and we learn to fly, which was my favorite part of the novel.  The key is to throw yourself at the ground and miss.  I enjoyed it. I am in the process of reading the entire trilogy, but I am putting it down after each book because, not being a fan of Sci - Fi,  I do get a little tired of the names and ridiculous situations.

It is filled with book excerpts and magazine articles and 2 works of fiction, the rest is all \\"true\\".  Or at least as true as Mafia stories go.  My favorite excerpts from this book were the brief portion of Donnie Brasco.  It showed just how mundane going undercover in the Mob can be.  I also quite enjoyed the section from \\"Killer\\".  We get to see the mob through a hitmans eyes.  He tells you how cold he is and how after the first couple of hits, he could murder someone then go spend a quiet evening with his family.  He never felt remorse because in his mind \\"You must have done something pretty bad to bring em to your door.\\"  Also the excerpt from \\"Boss of Bosses\\" is comical in the sense that the Mafia Don of the Gambino crime family convinced the 2 FBI agents that had him in custody, to take him out to lunch.

But I do not see that as a determent.  Through the 800+ pages of text you meet many different and fascinating characters while our core is basically defined in the first hundred and expanded throughout.  There are many typical fantasy elements.  The naive group sent on a chase or being chased never having enough time to wonder about what is happening to them.  However as noted by a few other reviews here, Jordan knew what he was doing when he wrote this.  He introduced you to a few characters and let them slip by, and you know you will see them again in one of the (as of now) 8 sequels. All in all the only real difference between this and all other fantasy novels I have read is the strong presence of women as warrior/leaders.  The novel is finely written and if you truly enjoy it, it will take up more than a few evenings to reach the climactic ... well it doesn't really end, so much as it runs out of room. If you are a fan of fantasy I highly recommend this one, if you are not a big fantasy fan, perhaps you should start on something lighter.<BR>Thanks For your time.<BR>T	2002-04-27

I may be one of a handful of people who have ever compared Heller to Adams, but the irreverence and the quick chatter gave me a definite feel of Heller.  One of these reviews said that this book was a great work of British comedy, don't let that scare you, it is really a great work of comedy.

I am a very poor golfer, if I break 100 I am a happy man.  however I do enjoy the game (I am still trying to figure out why).  This book takes you trough about a year and a half of life in the professional golf world.  Through all levels of the game, the PGA Tour, the Senior Tour, The Nike Tour and Q-School.  Through reading this book you learn what a world class golfer must go through to be that good.  Realize that in golf, there are no home games so that means enormous amounts of time away from family. Also, golfers have to work everyday to maintain that edge. This is such a tight knit group that competitors will actually give pointers to each other during practice.  It was a well written piece that shed a lot of light on a world most of us will never see.

This was a look at the world of Atlanta, Socialites and business is a town that (apparently) is not that far from the sticks.  Since I have never been to Atlanta, or anywhere down south, I do not know if this rings true to socialite, elitist Atlanta.  It is a good weaving of 3 tales, A successful Atlanta business man who has made some bad decisions lately and is about to lose it all, the mayor of Atlanta and an old friend teeming up to prevent a social tragedy involving a heinous deed perpetrated by a despicable man, who just happens to have the right social standing, and a laborer who is sent to prison after the worst string of bad luck I have ever seen and finds salvation in the words of Epictetus and Zeus.  I found the book engrossing at times and long winded at others.  If there had been about 200 fewer pages I would have rated this book a 4 or a 5, but it just seemed to drag a little. If long novels don't bother you then I strongly suggest this one. If you are more a fan of the quick, short book, don't bother.  Thanx for your time, T	2001-09-01
US	50543029	RFHVHA3BMH8V4	1583220208	123703959	God Bless You, Dr. Kevorkian	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Quick, Snappy, and Deep.	If you have never read Vonnegut, I suggest starting here. This ia a fine novel with a unique premise. Each chapter the author is killed and brought back to life so he can interview souls on the other side, both famous and ordinary. The insights brought back are well worth the trip. The major flaw in this book is the fact that it is only 77 pages (paperback). With a cast of characters that could span all of human history, there was so much more that could have been done. Thanx for your time, T	2001-08-27

This book is very typical of Kurt and his craft.  It is very similar to the 12 other books by him that I have read in pace and patterns.  But like Slapstick, his look at the future did not enthrall me.  Also I am not an environmentalist so the overall theme of the book &quot;Humans will destroy the Earth if we don't do something&quot; didn't touch me.  The only character in the book who is compelling is the headless son of Kilgore Trout.  His roll is the events is so passive that you can't &quot;root&quot; for him. And there was no one else in the book to grab my attention.  All in all it was written well and read quick, like all his previous books, but there was nothing in it that jumped out and begged for attention.  Thanx for your time: T	2001-04-18
US	50543029	RZTWQ2QEUJSFD	038529929X	313045692	Hannibal: A Novel	Books	1	2	3	N	N	A waste	A waste, a total waste of Hannibal Lecter and the writing ability of Thomas Harris.  There are parts of the book that are on the edge of your seat good,  but those are few and far between and overshaddowed with Harris' infatuation with gore.  Between pigs eating people, dogs eating a human face and the finale,  the book just leaves you sick. And regretting wasting the time to read this book.  I rated this book a 1 but it should have been a  zero, but the scale doesn't go that low so I'll have to make do. Thanx for your time:  T	2001-04-18

In this novel Puzo steps out of his standard world of massive corruption (mafia), into another, politics.  The book is fast moving and if you read the cover jacket it only tells about the first quarter of the book.  There  is much more.  It is a sttory of a man who tries his best to be a decent  man, but after a string of horrible events that ruin everything he has once  held dear, he slowly makes the transition to &quot;the dark side&quot;.   With subtle change you watch the character of Francis Kennedy turn from a  man of honor to a man of evil.  Some of the elements of the book are  completely unbelievable, but isn't that what fiction is for?	2000-05-29
US	50543029	R2OTSZ9OH7L61F	0440206154	247672694	Red Dragon	Books	5	0	0	N	N	A great book that just kept getting better.	I got the book Red Dragon because I enjoyed the movie silence of the lambs and the pure evil that is Hanibal Lecter.  I was a little disappointed that Lecter was a rather minimal character. However taht is where my  disappointment ended.  Will Graham is a truly engrossing character and the  villain Francis Dolarhyde almost made you feel sorry for him. All in all a  great fast read that keeps the pages going until stunning twist and a  startling ending.	2000-05-26

After all the mahines are more efficient than man could ever be.  Thoughout the book the question is constantly posed  &quot;if machines do all the work, what is a human being for?&quot;  The  question is mainly left unanswered by kurt, I guess he leaves that up to us  to figure out.  All in all it was a good book that kept my interest and i  would recommend to anyone, especially someone who is a fan of Kurt  Vonnegut's work.	2000-05-26
