That's the typical party-line though, so I really shouldn't be surprised.  If there's no hero-worship of Clinton, then someone should be cast aside as absolute bumbling moron.  Right.  Bottom line is that Mr. Freeh was dead on the money with his assessment of Billy boy and that's what irked Billy so much.  Billy didn't see that coming when he first appointed Mr. Freeh, but then, boy howdy how the tables did turn.  An agent who actually did his job, no matter what the stakes, and no matter whether it meant going after his boss.  (Psst...folks, in much lower levels of employment, we have things called whistle-blower laws which are similar in nature and, when utilized, tend to be regarded by the very same liberal blow-hards as sacred.)  Anyway, I digress.  When Freeh realized the scope of Billy's absolute depravity and corruption, it was an all-bets-are-off kind of deal, and the rest is history.  Now, is some other fool down below indicating that Freeh is responsible for the state of terrorism today?  I'm sorry, I thought you said a few weeks ago that \\"Dubya\\" was.  Ok, today it's Freeh.  Yeah, right.  Sorry fella, that fault rests with Billy Boy too, who was handed these terrorists many times but declined to act.  Ultimate responsibitly and ultimate authority people...that's the point.  And that's the scope of this treatise. Get over your stupidity and politics and just take a gander for a second at the simple truth of history as it has been played out and firmly established.  Or, as you're known to do, stick your fingers in your ears, close your eyes, and sing....ignorance is bliss after all, right?	2005-10-12

Mainly because I hardly recollect any teachings being given to me on Jesus in the boardroom.  but, then again, those back-room visits with priests are repressed to the furthest vestivules of my memory, and for good and just reasons I might add.  But, I think the most profound element/principle of this book comes in it's final chapter, when it's revealed that when you're acting as Jesus in the boardroom, it's important not to aggravate the Jewish board of directors, for they have a tendency to over-react and literally crucify people over the tiniest of slip-ups.

Better yet, if you've been considering one BATALI cookbook, this is definitely it.  This is, by far, the best entry in his series of cookbooks, and I own them all.  Perhaps the largest, certainly the most luxurious, and, for the general cooks out there, DEFINITELY, the most easiest, least-complex, easy to grasp.  Another outstanding point, the recipies are not totally time consuming, something that is invaluable in this day and age when most don't have countless hours to prepare foods for the daily meals.<br /><br />There are countless recipies in here.  I cannot begin to address them all.  But importantly, they are all accessible, feature tasteful, easy to find ingredients (something many cookbooks go out of their way to avoid doing - hello Nobu and Charlie Trotter), and outside of containing recipies written in a coherent, easy to follow manner, feature incredible prose and stunning photography.  This is not only a cookbook you can prepare wonderful meals with, but one you can just sit down and PLEASURABLY read.<br /><br />Definitely get this.

It's the same type of thing she was apparently after, albeit FAR more disturbingly, in other travesty, \\"AMAZING YOU: GETTING SMART ABOUT YOUR PRIVATE PARTS.\\"  Yes, that's what other \\"book\\" this genius is responsible for.

Why not contribute to the whole realm of B.S. by writing a treatise on B.S., analyzing B.S. and all of its ramifications, implications, effects, etc.  I mean, come on.

If you're new to the sport, or even if you're a vet seeking to oil the gears a bit, this is truly a valuable source.  I come, as my name suggests, from an old-school background anyway.  My father saw to that.  Kid Blackie and John L. were names that I just about wore on my sleeve from my earliest childhood days, and when the Kid became the Mauler, that name went straight on my chest - even though I always carried his name by honor.  So, with Donovan's book, I have a bit of a bias and approach it with a sense of warmth and respect anyway.  But, even without all that, it has the bare bones that many books do not - invaluable knowledge, information and skills.

But it repeats and repeats at all stages of Dempsey's career and life.  While enjoyable, and I'll admit I am a history buff to a degree, I found it somewhat misplaced here and, after a while, annoying.  I had wished Kahn would stick to the ropes and Dempsey and left out \\"all you ever wanted to know about...\\"<br /><br />All told though, a dam* fine book and one I will truly treasure.  I definitely, definitely recommend this one.	2005-02-09

After years of hearing about the hype of this, I've done it.  Was it worth it? Does it live up to the sensationalism?  The answer is a resounding &quot;no.&quot;<br />I'll put it this way...if you are an heir to the Che, Fidel, Mao,  Lenin, or Marx family, you'll enjoy this book immensely.  For, as hopefully others have noticed, this is nothing more than quasi-fictionalized socialist/leftist propaganda.  Apparently, the west is bad and capitalism and all its ideals are inherently evil.  Yes, it's to each according to his needs, from each according to his ability in this book.  And Ms. Allende's message reads loud and clear.<br />I find it (somewhat) amazing that more people haven't noticed this.  It is a modern day &quot;Manifesto&quot; disguised as a some epic, dramatic tale.  Perhaps it is epic and dramatic, but each and every element of the tale--(if one pays attention to details, or are details just another opiate of the masses? Ms. Allende, I'm looking in your direction)---goes to establishing or demonstrating some evil of capitalism and the west, and glorifies all that is socialist.<br />Fine if that's your cup of tea.  More power to you and your pathetic political ideals. Its success rate has been clearly established....as has capitalism's.  But my point is this...don't confuse the issue as to what this book is truly about or truly espouses.  Call it for what it is.  Don't hide behind some faux b-s drama or deny the fact.  At least you'd deserve some degree of respect to simply come out and say what you believe.	2001-12-15

As has been said countless times here, this is a different type of Doc Ford book.  Perhaps I did somewhat of a disservice to myself---I started my love of (fictional) Randy Wayne White with \\"The Ten Thousand Islands.\\"  I then worked my way backwards to \\"The Mangrove Coast,\\" \\"Captiva,\\" and \\"North of Havana.\\" I have yet to pick up \\"Sanibel Flats,\\" but I plan to very soon.<br />Each of those aforementioned books (with the exception of \\"Sanibel Flats\\" and the present review) is Doc Ford tales in the first person.  This book is told from the third person.  It is a somewhat difficult transition to make.  The same is true for \\"Sanibel Flats\\"---I've discovered that from a cursory glance at it.<br />Doc Ford works so brilliantly in the first person, it's hard to accept anything else.  Perhaps it sounds a bit odd, but it causes a little alienation to arise between the reader and the character that is Doc Ford.  In other words, the reader does not feel as \\"inside\\" the character.  Presumably this is intentional, but it is difficult coming from the more recent Ford tales to the earlier ones.<br />That aside, this isn't a typical Doc Ford novel either.  It places a bigger spotlight on Tucker Gatrell (Ford's uncle) and his \\"friend\\" Joseph Egret.  But it is a Ford adventure nonetheless, and it is a (...) good one at that.  Randy Wayne White is an absolute master of this genre, and, as many reviewers state, is the definite heir apparent to the throne of John D. MacDonald/Travis McGee.<br />Definitely pick this one up at some point.  Start from the beginning and work your way forward rather than vice-versa.  And, definitely pick up his non-fictional works as well.  They are absolutely amazing.  I can't wait until his new non-fiction work is released in January.<br />Also, if you haven't already done so, look into anything by James Hall.  I'll leave it up to you to find (come on, don't you want to find anything yourselves?!! j/k), but there is an absolutely fantastic Hall book that involves the very same subject matter of White's \\"Ten Thousand Islands.\\"  It is very good to read them back to back.<br />Enjoy!t involves the very same subject matter of White's \\"Ten Thousand Islands.\\"  It is very good to read them back to back.<br />Enjoy!	2001-11-28

If you are coming to Hall via Hiaasen/Shames/Dorsey/Barry or even Leonard, a word of caution:  Hall tends to use a slightly more doom and gloom approach to his writing.  His is a work that is going to have a more ominious (even melancholy)tone to it---no offbeat hijinks to level off the atmosphere.  With the other authors, save for instance Randy Wayne White, you get a little humor to lighten the load somewhat.  Not here.  Here, you better hang on because it's going to be a bitter armageddon.<br />This is classic Hall.  The story involves a huge amount of topics, all of which Hall (like a juggler) never lets fall.  There are times when Hall returns to a point/storyline a bit late, but I truly only say that as a word of caution to those with severe attention-span disorders.  But, as I cautioned above, the storylines here weigh pretty heavy.<br />Topics include a mafioso guy with a penchant for child pornography.  An under-developed, highly-sexed-in-situations girl who in involved with an incestuous relationship with her father (whom she is trying to kill).  The incest-father is an ex-cia masterkiller who is slowly poisoning the stroke-victim-husband of his exwife (incest victim's mother).  Not to give too much away, mafioso guy is related to incest victim and exwife and has his hand in the murder. Or does he? How????

To those who think Tim Dorsey isn't in the same league as Hiaasen, Shames or Leonard and the rest of the ilk....I think you need to seriously develop some taste.  You want to talk about &quot;borrowing&quot; from Hiaasen?  Then read &quot;Big Trouble&quot; by Dave Barry.  As much as I love Hiaasen, and have read almost every one of his books, his approach thesedays is so extremely color-by-the-numbers, that you can see what's coming from about 20 miles away.<br />Dorsey stands on his own and he does it incredibly well.  With nods of the head to Hiaasen and even Barry (they do a &quot;cameo&quot; in this book), this book is its own creation.  It owes very little to the other authors. This book has many twists and turns, and it's fantastic to see how these characters get what's coming to them.  There are many times that what is going on in the story is just laugh-out-loud funny. Contrary to some of the short-attention-span readers below, you DO care what happens to these characters.  They DO come to life and make you feel as if you almost know them.  Having lived in Tampa, as well as South Florida before, maybe this is a humor that is best appreciated by Florida folks.  Maybe there's something that's lost in the translation on its way to other states (Virginia and Oregon, I'm looking in your direction.)<br />A word of &quot;caution&quot; I suppose is in order.  Not to give away the ending of this book, but, it just ends.  It ends with an old-fashioned radio program ending such as:  &quot;Will our hero escape the death trap?&quot; or &quot;What will become of?&quot;  Yes, no perfect-wrap-it-up-in-a-pretty-bow style &quot;EPILOGUE&quot; endings so famous with Hiaasen and ripped off by Barry and Shames.  Perhaps some kudos are in order for creative marketing skills, I don't really know.<br />Having said that about the ending, the story continues and is  picked back up in &quot;Hammerhead Ranch Motel.&quot;  So, my advice, buy both of these books to get the complete tale, or you will be just left wondering.<br />You want some Florida authors that make Hiaasen (again, even as much as I love him), Shames, Barry, and Dorsey, seem like school children? Look into James W. Hall and Randy Wayne White.  They are truly gifted and epitomize literary skill.  If overall wackiness is your genre, look further into anything by Christopher Moore.<br />Enjoy it for good writing, great humor, and a entertaining story. If you're constantly reading line by line, looking for things similar to other authors, get a life.  You have far too much time on your hands if that's the case.  If it is the case, think about this, someone (and I won't name names) said that all fiction is styled directly from &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Huckleberry Finn.&quot;  Put that in your pseudo-intellectual pipe and smoke it., or you will be just left wondering.<br />You want some Florida authors that make Hiaasen (again, even as much as I love him), Shames, Barry, and Dorsey, seem like school children?

US	51393802	R1Q4SSA7J6RKQP	0446343455	293791358	Tourist Season	Books	3	2	4	N	N	An obvious first attempt...	Perhaps I did somewhat of a disservice to myself.  I began my love of Hiaasen with &quot;Stormy Weather.&quot;  Then I went to &quot;Sick Puppy.&quot;  Then I went back to &quot;Lucky You.&quot;  Next, I went to &quot;Native Tongue.&quot;  I still haven't read &quot;Strip Tease,&quot; largely because I am somewhat put off by it from the travesty that was the movie with Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds.<br />I put off, and put off, buying the first two works of &quot;Tourist Season&quot; and &quot;Double Whammy.&quot;  I can't quite explain it, but something just wouldn't motivate me to get them.  Then, I realized that I love Hiaasen's work far too much, and just broke down.<br />Well, my reluctance was *somewhat* justified.  This first book is a rather dull (by Hiaasen standards) tale.  The characters are nowhere near as endearing as his later ones....especially those that we get introduced to in &quot;Double Whammy&quot; (i.e., Skink and Jim Tile)...and who later become downright loveable (i.e., &quot;Stormy Weather,&quot; &quot;Sick Puppy,&quot; etc.).  I'm reading &quot;Double Whammy&quot; now, and find it to be much, much better than this...but still a hair shy of the greatness Hiaasen later acheives.<br />Furthermore, I found that this book just kind of ended....and that was it.  No real climax, nothing approaching the level that Hiaasen reached in his later works.  Ok, perhaps this is understandable since it was his first outing.  It's just, having read his incredible works first, I was let down by this one and didn't find to be anywhere near the &quot;amazing&quot; story that many allege (or review) it to be.<br />In addition, it somewhat dated by today's standards, and I found that I had to slip into somewhat of a nostaliga-esque mindset to appreciate the beauty of a woman coming home from her jazzer-cise classes, wearing leg warmers and turning on her brand new Sony Trinitron television.  Hopefully you catch my drift somewhat, but if not, just appreciate that this book was written circa 1985-1986, and it reflects it.  Get in your best &quot;Dallas&quot; or &quot;Knotts Landing&quot; (or, ok, even &quot;Miami Vice&quot;) mindset, and you'll be fine.<br />All in all, not altogether bad.  Just glad I became such an avid fan of Hiaasen by working backwards.  Had I read this one first, I don't know if I would have continued to make the effort.his book was written circa 1985-1986, and it reflects it.

Ok, let's just get the obvious over with...yes, this in exactly the same &quot;neighborhood&quot; (if not &quot;house&quot;) as Carl Hiaasen.  Having said that, think Hiaasen as in &quot;Stormy Weather,&quot; &quot;Lucky You,&quot; or &quot;Sick Puppy,&quot; or even &quot;Native Tongue.&quot;  It is, not to be blasphemous or anything, better than Hiaasen's work(s) in &quot;Tourist Season&quot; or &quot;Double Whammy.&quot;<br />I've been reading Barry for over ten years now, and his typical sarcasm and wit shines through every page of this one.  Sometimes it gets a bit over-the-top....in other words, there are times when just a few sentences (commenting on some idiosyncratic or esoteric facet of life) would have sufficed...yet Barry, in his usual news article form, goes on and on and on.  Those who know Barry know what I'm talking about.  It's those sentences in which he uses about 25 commas, 10 colons, 8 semi-colons, 6 hyphens, 5 &quot;....&quot; (look who's talking...), and 30 parentheticals.<br />That's a bit much and it, at times, makes for long-windedness that ventures far beyond the story-line and amounts to a more of a Andy Rooney-esque commentary (&quot;did'ya ever notice how...&quot;).<br />But, that critique aside, and aside from the (now)quintessentially Hiaasen type yarn, this is vintage Barry.  It is funny, intriguing, and really makes you hate to put the book down.  I found that I read it in two sittings.<br />All in all, very enjoyable.  The characters are absolutely hilarious, and, as in Hiaasen's work, leave you dying to know how they get what's coming to them.<br />Also, for more in this vein, check out the later-works of Hiaasen mentioned above.  In addition, for another Florida-mystery-spoof-type road that is a little less travelled, look into the works of Tim Dorsey.  His &quot;Florida Road Kill&quot; and &quot;Hammerhead Ranch Motel&quot; are pretty dam* good....even by the godfather's (Hiaasen's) standards.	2001-10-10

The photographs are simply timeless and beautiful.  I can't quite describe the vibe that it captures or conveys, but I found myself somewhat saddened by the book.  The pictures kind of struck a whole \\"Dead Poet's Socitey,\\" \\"Carpe Diem\\" mood with me.  At the same time, they conveyed the beauty of a time in California (or for that matter, the U.S.) that is forever lost and will never be recaptured.  A time of innocence and naivete, before everything became so tainted, jaded, and overcrowded.<br />I don't know, maybe that's just a crock.  At any rate, as a surfer of 20 years, this book really touched me.  I think it will touch any fellow surfer, or for that matter, ocean lover.<br />Definitely pick this one up before it goes out of print (as these things so swiftly seem to do).	2001-07-27

Much like it's worthy counterpart's book (Tra Vigne), this wonderful piece should not fail to delight and please all those who happen across it.<br />First, if you are lucky enough to have dined at Terra, you'll already understand the beauty of (and behind) this book.  Quite simply, this is a work of art.  Why is that the case?  Well...<br />Design--Beautiful graphic design and photographs.  The layout is incredible and the photos are enough to make you drool.<br />Dialogue--Add to that delightful text and dialogue.  Much closer to what this book achieves is the word &quot;prose&quot; as opposed to merely &quot;text.&quot;  The stories and dialogue are true pleasure to read.  It makes this much more than simply a &quot;cookbook.&quot;<br />Recipes--The recipes are, much like the food at the restaurant, exquisite.  They are just delicious. Their difficulty ranges from relatively easy to moderately difficult.  But, they are very easy to follow, making even the harder recipes accessible to the average &quot;joe.&quot;<br />I strongly urge those considering this one to just go ahead and make the purchase.  You will not be disappointed.  It will be book you will treasure, and will reach for time and again.<br />Also, look into the Tra Vigne cookbook.  It too is on the same level as this piece.	2001-01-02

I'll try to sum it up in a few main points...<br />Design--the design on this book makes it a work of art.  The photographs and layout are literally awe-inspiring. A word of caution...the size is very cumbersome and doesn't exactly make for ease in the kitchen.<br />Text--Very enjoyable text and it is pleasurable reading.  Most helpful are pointers on technique and procedure.<br />Recipes--Most are difficult, a few are pretty easy.  Herein lies the caveat/point of caution.  To understand this point, one must understand the philosophy of this restaurant/Keller.  Food is a work of art and presentation is everything in Keller's mind.  With that in mind, be ready to break out the tweezers and forcepts to get this food to appear as it does in the restaurant/book.  It can be painstaking and frustratingly over-done.<br />On the restaurant--It is a very good restaurant and worthy of most of the commendations about it.  It is perhaps one of the best dining experiences I've experienced.  However, it is becoming, in my humble opinion, slightly over-rated.  The wait on reservations has now hit the 3 months+ mark. (From those slightly less demanding, I've heard stories of a 6 month wait.) In other words, if you would like to dine there in April, better make reservations in January at the latest.  To be honest, the experience is not THAT fabulous and such a wait is more of a product of hype than of quality.  You would be better off going to Terra or Tra Vigne in the same area.  It would likely be more enjoyable as well.<br />Don't get me wrong.  This is a fantastic book and it is a fantastic restaurant.  It is just not THAT fantastic if you follow me.<br />But as for the book, purchase it if you understand what you're in for--it will be a valuable addition.	2001-01-02

Simply put, this is a terrific addition to your cookbook library.  Why? Well, in a few main points, because:<br />Easy, very accessible recipes.  Practicality is the cornerstone of much of Oliver's recipes.  You won't find overly difficult or complex recipes here.  Very easy-to-do, simple-to-follow approaches.  Very easy to find ingredients.  At the same time, taste and presentation are not sacrificied either.  The recipes are simply delicious.  Very important.  By comparison, everything that Bittman tried to achieve in the &quot;Minimalist&quot; cookbook is acheived and far surpassed by Oliver.<br />Thoroughly enjoyable text.  Oliver is very funny.  His humor and wit come across strikingly well.  His stories are personal as well.  His writing makes for simply enjoyable reading.  Quite a bonus when it comes to cookbooks.<br />Very nice graphics and layout.  The photographs are beautiful, and the design that went into the publishing of this book is top of the line.  Very good.<br />Also a plus, more so for novice chefs (or beginners), is the inclusion of many helpful tips and pointers.  Oliver puts in his two-cents worth on what to look for in &quot;staples&quot; or the basics of cooking.  Anything from raw ingredients, to cooking utensils.  Nice to have and refer to when/should the need strike you.<br />VERY WORTH having this text in your kitchen.  You will enjoy it and value it.  You and yours will also reap the benefits of this text by way of some outstanding recipes.<br />Enjoy!	2000-11-21

This is an incredible book to have in your collection, if, for nothing  else, the reasons below:<br />Incredible graphic design.  A general rule of  thumb--if Chronicle are the publishers of the book, it'll have a fantastic  layout.  These are the guys who brought to life Michael's devastatingly  good vision in the &quot;Tra Vigne&quot; cookbook.  Likewise, they also  published Georgeanne Brennan's &quot;Potager&quot; and &quot;Mediterranean  Herb&quot; cookbooks.  The layouts are ALWAYS superb, and each and every  release has beautiful photographs and dialogue.  Which brings me to my next  point.<br />Great dialogue.  Offers a surprisingly thorough history of olive  oil.  Likewise, it offers a good summary on how to pick, store, and use  different types of olive oils, as well as offering a mini glossary of olive  oil colloquialisms (i.e., &quot;extra-virgin&quot; and &quot;first-cold  pressed&quot;, etc.).  Also, Peggy's personality and humor come across very  well and make the text quite an enjoyable read. This is something that just  isn't normally found in many cookbooks who only see things through a  step-by-step, color-by-numbers approach to cooking.<br />Of course,  importantly,<br />Very good recipes.  The recipes are extremely tasty.  Most  are amazingly simple, yet turn out spectacular.  The approach is very  simple, yet home-y...including ingredients typically found (or readily  available) to the novice, home cook.<br />Get this book and I guarantee that  you will not regret its inclusion in your collection!	2000-09-18

Far surpasses &quot;Catcher&quot; if  you ask me.<br />These are (you guessed it....nine) short stories.  Most are  quite dark and have an excellent ability to instill the reader with  brooding/uneasy feelings.<br />Take the opener....&quot;A perfect day for  bananafish&quot;.  This is what lead me to J.D. Salinger, and particularly  this work.  As an aside, and a piece of factoid--take it for whatever its  worth--this work inspired The Cure to record the song  &quot;Bananafishbones.&quot;  But, this story is kind of a creepy, weird  little story with an ending that just blew me away.  (No pun intended for  those who have read it.)<br />And so it goes, from that one forward.  The mood  has been set.  One after the other, dark, rather cold, stories.  But, it's  all painfully good.<br />All in all, a good collection of stories from one of  the greatest American authors.	2000-08-23

Bittman is an excellent chef, and generally has fantastic ideas in the kitchen.  His works usually provide for (almost) immediate accessability,  and relative ease.<br />However, I don't follow what brought him to the  &quot;less is more&quot; camp on this one.  I wouldn't expect this approach  for Bittman, and one can sense that he is venturing somewhat outside his  normal/typical mode.<br />Whereas this book does not necessarily provide for  difficult recipes, it does provide for slightly esoteric ones.  Often, the  recipes call for items not typically kept in the house.  Of course, I'm  speaking &quot;typically&quot; in the &quot;rank-and-file&quot; sense of  most people out there.  I guess what that means is that if you are a devout  follower/worshipper of Martha Stewart or only subscribe to the Crisco way  of cooking, this book isn't for you.<br />I do immensely enjoy this one, and  find it to be a valuable inclusion to my cooking texts.  The recipes are  almost always delicious and take (at most) mid-level effort.<br />Worth  having, but don't over-expect.	2000-08-23

This book epitomizes that notion.<br />Simply, this is it.  This is the be  all, end all of texts on this masterpiece by the late F.L.W.<br />I have been  an admirer of F.L.W. since I was in the fifth grade, and had to do a report  on earthquakes and buildings.  Living in S.F., I guess this was a hot  topic.  But, in a showing (foreshadowing?) of extremely good taste---if I  do say so myself, I chose F.L.W. and the TransAmerica building.  For those  of you out of the loop, that's the &quot;pyramid&quot; building you see  when looking at (virtually every) snapshot(s) of the S.F. skyline.  I  hadn't yet discovered Fallingwater, but I would eventually be shown the  way...<br />This is such an incredibly beautiful house.  Honestly, I could not  imagine the blessing of owning that house and living there.  This text,  however, sets it all out.<br />EXCELLENT photos, both inside and out....in  different seasons as well.<br />VERY GOOD text and dialogue.  Provides a  great understanding of the dream, planning, undertaking, and completion of  this masterpiece.<br />This is an incredibly text.  I cannot urge you enough  to purchase this one.

To those already in the know, would you expect anything less from such an  incredible place?<br />Of course not.<br />To those considering, consider no  further.  This book is IT! Why? Well:<br />Superb graphic design--almost  worthy of the price of admission in itself.<br />The recipes--Absolutely  perfect for implementing your own Pavlovian experiments.  One almost begins  salivating just thinking about the contents of the book.<br />The difficulty  (of the above)--Minimally difficult.  At times, the recipes can become a  bit vexing for those who have only dabbled exclusively in (a) stir-fry; (b)  deep-fried anything; (c) shake n' bake; or, (d) Stouffer's.  Joking aside,  some of the recipes are difficult.  Most however, a very well suited to the  novice chef.<br />The dialogue--Excellent.  I can close my eyes and be in the  courtyard...having those wonderful smells waft to and fro...the feel of the  crisp air...particularly when there is that ever-so-slight chill in the  air.  Michael's wonderful abilities are no longer limited to the kitchen.  They never were, mind you, however now others can realize that.  The book  will bring to mind an array of images and memories in a strikingly  Steinbeck-ian, Hemingway-ian, Calvino-ian, or [insert your favorite author  here]-ian way.<br />Get this book.  It, in many very real ways, is more than a  book of recipes.<br />You will enjoy it.	2000-08-14
