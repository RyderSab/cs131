The tale begins with two threads: Joe Dixon, Frank's brother, goes off to become a World War One aviator and is killed (or is he?) and Frank, already an amateur detective, goes to Europe to investigate. Meanwhile, Carson Keene, Carolyn's father, is about to marry a woman young enough to be Carolyn's sister and Carolyn, thinking only of Carson's happiness, flees to Paris.<br />In the course of their European adventures, both Frank and Carolyn meet up with and befriend some of the famous literati of the \\"Lost Generation\\", such as Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.<br />Frank discovers that Joe had married a French woman while overseas and sets about tracking her down, while Carolyn discovers that her step-mother had a somewhat shady past. Eventually Frank and Carolyn meet and, gasp, fall in love!<br />Unfortunately, the course of true love never runs smooth and that, along with Carson's death, break the loving couple up, as Carolyn leaves Paris to return to River Heights. Never one to mope, Frank puts his time to good use in tracking down clues about his brother's long-lost wife - a trail which leads him to England.<br />I don't want to give away the story here, I'm sure you'd rather find out for yourselves how this all turns out in the end.<br />I enjoyed Mystery Box despite the somewhat improbable nature of the plot. I just find the premise of both Frank and Carolyn hobnobbing with some of the most famous writers of the 20th century a bit hard to swallow but if one suspends disbelief, it shouldn't bother you too much! The dialog rings fairly true, despite some lapses into sappy romanticism. Some of the action would not out of place in any one of your favorite series books. All in all, this is an enjoyable read for lovers of Nancy or thebrothers Hardy.	2004-01-04

Dixon and The Hardy Boys	Books	1	12	15	N	Y	A Bitter Disappointment	\\"The House On The Point\\" is a modern rewrite of the classic Hardy Boys adventure, \\"The House On The Cliff\\".   Reading it brings to mind the old axiom: \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\\"  The original \\"The House On The Cliff\\" is one of the best of the Hardy Boys canon and can scarcely be improved on, yet the author tries - vainly.  For no reason at all, he changes the name of some of the major recurring characters in the series and has the Hardy Boys and their friends jive-talking in 40's slang.   Additionally, there is the excrutiatingly dull prose and a pedantic attention to minute details that leave nothing to the readers imagination, thus making this book a chore to get through.  The original outline for \\"The House On The Cliff\\" is available to any researcher at the NY Public Library. The author should have consulted that instead of attempting to \\"modernize\\" this classic story with his rather bizarre ideas.  Your best bet is to stick with the Applewood Books edition of \\"The House On The Cliff\\".	2003-04-11

PLOT IN A NUTSHELL: Upright, hardworking-but-poor orphan Ted Scott dreams of a career in aviation while he toils away at his menial job in the mammoth plant of the Devally-Hipson Aero Corporation. His foster father, Eben Browning, was swindled by Brewster Gale, so Ted beats up both of Gale's obnoxious sons a couple of times (An act repeated in most of the other stories as well. You'd think they'd learn to steer clear of Ted!). He then impresses/saves a couple of rich (and apparently very lonely) businessmen, Walter Hapworth and Paul Monet, who wine and dine him and then send him to flying school. After a series of aerial adventures both at school and in the service of the Post Office, one of the rich guys builds him a plane, Ted makes a grueling solo flight to Paris and becomes a world famous hero.<br />THE END<br /><br />Comments: The Ted Scott series was written to cash in on the aviation craze that swept the nation after \\"Lucky Lindy\\" made his famous flight. This story is so close to recounting that flight and Ted Scott so closely resembles Charles Lindbergh, it's a wonder Lindy didn't sue for royalties!<br />  The Syndicate must have had it's ghosts working overtime on this volume, since it hit the stands not long after Lindy landed in Paris! Aviation stories had become a staple for \\"Boys\\" series' starting not long after Wilbur & Orville made the first flight, however, there were several other aviation series started around this time (Andy Lane, Slim Tyler, Randy Starr among others) but, for my money, the Ted Scott series is superior to them all.<br />  This story is well written (surprisingly so, considering the fact that it was rushed into print). It carries the reader along with the right blend of action, adventure and a bit of mystery. I don't know if kids back then were smarter but the prose is certainly superior to that which is written to the same age group today.<br />  Ted is a likable hero; loyal, brave, intelligent and self-effacing to a fault and, despite the fact that Ted has amazingly bad luck in the air, his adventures aren't too improbable.	2003-01-21

US	52837293	R2HY73D8G70D3B	0448089319	820267631	The Secret of Wildcat Swamp (The Hardy Boys, No. 31)	Books	4	5	6	N	N	One of the better stories in the series	This review is based on the original version published in 1952 but it should be noted that the plot of the revision closely follows that of the original. It is at times difficult to compare the very early volumes with the latter volumes but I regard this story as one of the best overall in the canon. The opening two chapters might be regarded as a bit weak compared to other volumes in the set, since a mystery is dumped into the brothers laps when Cap Bailey pays them a visit at their home.<br />  After laying down a framework for the mystery before them, the brothers hope to gain some information by going to the local prison to see some unsavory men who are mixed up in the affair. We are introduced to three memorable criminals: Willie The Penman, Jessie Turk and Gerald Flint. Willie and Flint are already on the loose, Turk is in jail but stages a prison break by the end of chapter 1.<br />  The next several chapters are very eventful. The brothers make their way out of Bayport, heading west with the criminals hard on their heels. By Chapter 5, the brothers and Cap Bailey are in Wildcat Swamp, on horseback camping in the desert and the woods near and in the swamp. Immediately they are attacked by \\"an enormous wildcat\\", letting the reader know that the beasts are forever lurking through the swamp. Strangely though, no more appear throughout the remainder of the book. From this point onward the book is suspenseful, well written and adventurous with a fairly good mystery that is not solved by dumb luck.<br />  The trio spend the next few chapters dodging perils in the swamp while digging for fossils, which is the underlying plot throughout the book. By chapter 9 they are approached by Snake, Snide and Willie, who identify themselves as Forest Rangers and order them out of the swamp in a memorable scene. Later that night the boys eavesdrop on the Rangers in conversation, only to be shot at. The trio stand their ground and refuse to leave the swamp. These middle chapters are fascinating and one experiences that wish fulfillment that the Hardy Boys series is famous for, as we can envision ourselves camping by fire in just such a swamp.<br />  While further digging for fossils in the swamp, round about chapter 10, Frank finds a sign ending in \\"ERS\\", which fits a sign found in earlier chapters that read \\"Here lie the Bodies of Twenty Wildcat\\" Deducing that it was wildcatters, not wildcats, that were buried there suddenly leads to the speculation that oil lies on the property. This detective work blends in beautifully with the title of the book. The Boys visit Mrs. Sanders, the owner of the property, to alert her of their findings then return to their camp.<br />  Chet arrives quite unexpectedly and he remains with Cap at the camp while Frank and Joe are away alerting Sanders. Here the book takes its greatest turn as the Rangers, in yet another memorable and suspenseful scene right out of a movie, overwhelm Cap and Chet in a cave and tie them up until they are rescued at the end of the book. Frank and Joe are ambushed on route to Sanders property, but escape a couple chapters later.<br />  This book is like something out of 1881 rather than 1952. They hop a freight train, only to have it wrecked and roll off the tracks, hijacked by the Flint's gang. They eavesdrop on a campfire of thieves and eventually learn enough to put away the gang.

It is similar to The Twisted Claw, in that it belongs to another era. Often underrated, Wildcat Swamp should be regarded as one of the best books of the series, certainly among the volumes from The Mark on The Door onward.pters are fascinating and one experiences that wish fulfillment that the Hardy Boys series is famous for, as we can envision ourselves camping by fire in just such a swamp. <BR>     While further digging for fossils in the swamp, round about chapter 10, Frank finds a sign ending in \\"ERS\\", which fits a sign found in earlier chapters that read \\"Here lie the Bodies of Twenty Wildcat\\" Deducing that it was wildcatters, not wildcats, that were buried there suddenly leads to the speculation that oil lies on the property. This detective work blends in beautifully with the title of the book. The Boys visit Mrs. Sanders, the owner of the property, to alert her of their findings then return to their camp. <BR>     Chet arrives quite unexpectedly and he remains with Cap at the camp while Frank and Joe are away alerting Sanders. Here the book takes its greatest turn as the Rangers, in yet another memorable and suspenseful scene right out of a movie, overwhelm Cap and Chet in a cave and tie them up until they are rescued at the end of the book. Frank and Joe are ambushed on route to Sanders property, but escape a couple chapters later. <BR>     This book is like something out of 1881 rather than 1952. They hop a freight train, only to have it wrecked and roll off the tracks, hijacked by the Flint's gang. They eavesdrop on a campfire of thieves and eventually learn enough to put away the gang. All that remains is to capture them, which is done over the remaining chapters. <BR>     This book contains non-stop action and appeals to one's sense of adventure. It is similar to The Twisted Claw, in that it belongs to another era. Often underrated, Wildcat Swamp should be regarded as one of the best books of the series, certainly among the volumes from The Mark on The Door onward.	2001-09-29

This review concerns the original text edition by Applewood Books. <br />The Boys smash the fake eye surgery scam of quack Dr. Grafton and help Virginia Sinder and her grandma. This is a really good story! Another winner by Leslie McFarlane! The action never lets up from beginning to end. The sub-plots tie together nicely (except for Chet being sent to Boston, which is never adequately explained) and nobody does anything particularly stupid (except the inexplicable behavior of Virginia Sinder and her grandmother which borders on idiocy, proving the old adage of the apple not falling far from the tree!) The Boys show plenty of guts, quick thinking and some decent detecting. Grafton is one of the meanest, slimiest villians ever! Aunt Gertrude is annoying, ill-mannered and ill-tempered as usual. Definitely in the top 10 of all the stories in the original canon.  <br />	2001-05-19

They decide to explore lonely s Cabin Island but are chased away by a surly stranger (Hanliegh). On the way back, they nearly come to ruin in an accident with another iceboat manned by Tad Carson and Ike Nash, a pair of obnoxious bullies.<br />Heading home from this near disaster, they find a message from Elroy Jefferson (who's car they recovered in The Shore Road Mystery). They head over to Jefferson's posh digs to collect a reward and obtain permission to camp out on Jefferson's Cabin Island retreat over the Christmas school holiday.<br />The Boys along with Chet and Biff head out to the island on their iceboats and have an unpleasant encounter with Ike and Tad, who are in cahoots with Hanliegh. They chase Hanliegh off the island and settle in for some rousing winter adventures.  Soon, they find their supplies stolen and head to the nearest town to get more from elderly storekeeper, Amos Grice, and, incidentally, discover from him that Jefferson had a valuable stamp collection stolen many years ago.<br />Back at the island, they have more adventures, discover a notebook dropped by Hanliegh indicating that the stolen stamps are hidden in the chimney of the cabin. They make a search and, surprise, find nothing.<br />Later, during a howling blizzard, they are forced to rescue Hanliegh who has come to grief in an iceboat accident. The storm increases in intensity, finally blowing down the chimney of the old cabin. Searching through the rubble, the Boys discover the stamp collection which miraculously has escaped any damage whatsoever despite being walled into a chimney over a huge fireplace for more than twenty years. They return the stamps to Jefferson and pick up yet another reward and Jefferson's offer to let them use his Cabin Island retreat any time they want.<br />Comments: This tale appears on almost everyone's list of favorite Hardy Boys stories and with good reason. The story is well written and paced and the prose is charmingly evocative and descriptive. One can almost picture oneself ice-boating and camping along with the Boys and their chums.<br />The mystery is, as usual, solved pretty much by dumb luck (aided by the infamous foul weather that seems to plague Bayport) but this doesn't take away from the excitement and mystery presented here.<br />The action is not too far removed from that which a teenage detective could accomplish. The villians are bad but not too bad and the mystery not too difficult to solve.<br />As in a few other of the earlier stories, the Boys arm themselves in this book (this time with rifles) and, although they threaten to use them, no shootings take place (except for a hapless fox who meets his demise in a totally extraneous sequence.)<br />Apparently the accident with the iceboat shook up Frank more than he cared to admit because the suggestion to go camping had to be made twice to him! When the suggestion was made the second time, Frank acts like he never heard of such a thing before - oh well!<br />I'm glad to note that, for once, the Boys' chums got a share of the reward but sadly there was no lip-smacking feast to cap off the Boys triumph in this case!<br />The revised version of this story by Andrew Svenson sticks close to the plot of the original and although the charm of McFarlane's prose is completely lost, it still ranks among the best of the revisions.	2001-05-19

This is a good story but, it's got some things that annoy me.        For one thing, Leslie McFarlane seems to be pandering to his audience here. The \\"innocent horseplay\\" that is so glibly dismissed as youthful hijinks in the first two chapters is only slightly short of criminal behavior and certainly is not what we expect of our heroes or their chums.        And how about that party at Chet's for 15 to 17 year olds that goes on until 2 AM, complete with orchestra and in the middle of the greatest economic depression in the country's history?        For another thing, Aunt Gertrude is at her obnoxious, overbearing worst in this story. For whatever other faults the villian Chris may have had, one can only admire his audacity for standing up to the old hag. Just once I'd like to see perennial jellyfish Laura Hardy get enough gumption to stand up to Gertie and say something along the lines of \\"Gertrude, you old battle axe, this is my house and these are my boys, so kindly shut up and mind your own business if you wish to continue sponging off us!\\" but, alas, Laura has never said a word.        Another odd thing is the complete absence of Fenton, who is out west on a case. Not a word from him or to him, even when Joe is kidnapped! I kept expecting him to show up and somehow tie his current case into the plot but he never did. Instead, those two dopey government agents show up for the climax. It would have been just as easy to tie Fenton into the plot, so why use those two dopes at all?....        We also discover another Hardy relative, a \\"Cousin Hattie\\" of Gresham. Just who she is related to is open for speculation but it is Gertie who refers to her as cousin. We also learn the Gertie is 65 years of age, which has to make her Fenton's elder, if not eldest, sister.        The one part of the story I particularly enjoyed was the Boys' trip to the city. Their adventures there are plausible and well written. The recounting of their trek back to Bayport (sleeping in CentralPark, taking trollies etc.) lends an air of authenticity to the story.

The Plot: One day shortly before summer vacation, the Boys, along with Chet, Biff and Jerry, are out motorcycling along the Shore Road and decide to investigate the spooky old abandoned Polucca house, high on the cliffs overlooking Barmet Bay. Once inside, they hear a shriek which scares all but Frank and Joe out. The Boys investigate but find nothing. They leave but a storm forces them all back to the house. They hear more shrieks, get locked in and part of the house starts to collapse! They finally get out but have problems with their motorcycles and find their tool kits stolen.<br />They are distracted by a boat chase out on the bay. There are shots from one boat and the other boat explodes! The Boys row out to save the pilot of the boat. Finding him injured, they bring him to a nearby farmhouse to recuperate. The man gives his name as \\"Jones\\" and claims \\"Snackley got me - the rat!\\" The Boys return home and Fenton tells them that Snackley is an infamous smuggler.<br />The next day, the Boys return to the farmhouse only to find the farmer and his wife bound and gagged. \\"Jones\\" is missing and the Boys give chase but lose him. Returning home, they find that Fenton has disappeared and a forged note left behind. They start a search and a truck driver reports he saw Fenton walking out by the Polucca place.<br />The next day, the Boys, accompanied by Chet, Biff, Tony and Phil, go out to the old home but find it's now occupied by some seedy characters. The occupants claim ignorance but Franks spots Fenton bloodied cap hanging inside the house!<br />They report their findings to Chief Collig, the fat, pompous leader of the Bayport PD, and his moronic sidekick, Det. Smuff. The cops dither and the Boys have to shame them into making an investigation. Reluctantly, the Chief agrees to go the next day and, of course, discovers nothing.<br />Fed up, the Boys take matters into their own hands and go out with Tony on his boat, \\"The Napoli\\", to explore the cliffs by the Polucca place. They find a hidden cove but are chased away at gunpoint by Snackley. Hanging around nearby till after dark, they overhear the smugglers. Frank and Joe go ashore and find a hidden cave entrance. They discover that it leads all the way to the cliff top and the smugglers are stashing their booty there.<br />Overhearing Snackley threatening Fenton, they attempt a rescue and are captured. Snackley threatens to send the Boys out to a watery grave with his partner-in-crime, Li Chang.<br />Later, Fenton overpowers the guard and they escape, only to be spotted and chased into the Polucca house. There's a running gun battle and Fenton and the Boys are recaptured. Suddenly, the state police show up and everything is thrown into turmoil. Fenton and Snackley have a life-and-death struggle and the gang is finally rounded up.<br />The Boys and Fenton split a $5,000 reward, we find out that Snackley was Polucca's nephew and that he had murdered the old man. With some of that 5 grand, the Boys throw a big dinner party for their pals in the barn behind the Hardy home.<br />Comments: The best story in the canon! A dark, violent tale of smuggling, drugs, kidnapping and murder! None of the other stories can match this one for sheer exciting adventure! I've always thought this tale would make a great Hardy Boys movie. The Boys show plenty of guts and good detective ability in this one. Fenton plays a major role here and he works well with his sons. The gun battle and fight at the climax is the most thrill-packed prose in any Hardy story. If you read only one Hardy Boys book, it should be this one.<br /> Rating: A+They find a hidden cove but are chased away at gunpoint by Snackley.

Alger's talent as a storyteller can not be denied as the reader is carried along from page to page, eager to find out what will happen to the eponymous hero next.   Why the author of the forward to this volume has chosen to continue to spread the myth of Alger's pedophilia is puzzling. The debunked and universally discredited biography by Alfred Mayes first started this canard in the early part of the 20th century and succeeding biographers have parroted Mayes' lies. Mayes himself admitted, in print, that the entire biography was a hoax from start to finish.   Alger should be remembered for his stories which paint a vivid picture of 19th century New York City street life and for the tremendous humanitarian work he performed for homeless children of New York City.	2001-04-26
