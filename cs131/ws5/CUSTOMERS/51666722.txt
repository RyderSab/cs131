The result was far short of my hopes.  (1) The writer seemed to know little about guns and shooting, which is  important in a story when most of the characters are snipers, (2) the  description of battle was strangely boring and unmoving [try &quot;the  forgotten soldier&quot; or &quot;black hawk down&quot;], (3) the love story  was simply silly, (4) making the woman American was pointless and  unrealistic and (4) everything was relentlessly pro-Russian. Not worth  reading, especially considering the weak writing and excessive cliches.	1999-10-01

The North Koreans and reporter  were photocopied from the John Wayne movie  - The Green Berets.  The writing style is dry and unimpressive.

The only nagging question I had was his assumption that if something didn't happen it must be impossible.   If Africans didn't  domesticate animals then they must be impossible to domesticate.  The  interesting part of the book is only about half its contents.  The rest is  filler - a combination of repitition, politically correct musings and  historical tid bits.  It would have been nice if he had instead spent the  space addressing some of the arguments for and against his theories.	1999-07-06

The diet takes no willpower and I lost an average of slightly over three pounds a week.   I feel great!  My wife, family and friends can't believe I'm losing so much weight.   I will stay on the diet in some form for the rest of my life.  I  had been gaining weight steadily since college and diets just did not work.    I wish I had known about the diet years ago but I believed that only a  low calorie diet could work.  After the reading the book and beginning the  diet it was as if a great secret was revealed to me. Although you should  read the book, the diet boils down to two rules.  Eat as much protein and  fat as you need not to be hungry.  As for carbohydrates, start very close  to zero and adjust the amount based on the weight loss you experience.  If  you're not losing, cut the carbs.  if you're losing too fast, add a few  carbs. Thank you Dr. Atkins for changing my life.	1999-03-10

However, the author(s)  should have focused on a smaller number of main characters and should have  tried to come up with a better ending.  The middle portion of the book had  some nice action and sexual scenes.  There was too much  legal detail in  some of the chapters.
