I gave this book two stars instead of one, just because a bad Judy Christenberry book isn't as bad as a stinker written by a lesser author. In other words, you could do much worse, I suppose.<br /><br />At first I had hopes for this book. The general premise of the story had real potential. But then I started to wonder, \\"When is the character development going to start? Where are the descriptive passages that help you understand how the characters *feel*?\\"<br /><br />They aren't there--at least not very much. It's like this was an outline for a book that should have been about twice as long in its finished state. The whole book had a distanced, sterile, unemotional quality to it.<br /><br />The story itself *could* have been okay, but there wasn't enough convincing conflict or passion. Everyone was sort of . . . dull and one dimensional. We are too often *told*, rather than *shown*, why the characters react and feel the way they do. Physical descriptions of the main characters are barely there, so we can't even visualize what they look like. We didn't learn much about the characters' backgrounds, either, which would have helped us understand and empathise with whatever emotional \\"baggage\\" they had.<br /><br />Usually in Christenberry's books we are treated to colorful characters with flaws and passions. We also have become accustomed to humor and conflict and getting emotionally sucked in to the character's lives--nope, not here.<br /><br />I suspect that Judy Christenberry was given some sort of restriction from the publishers when she was working on this book--or *something* was holding her back, because this book just missed the mark completely. It was flat and dry and lacking that special component that makes her books usually so engaging and fun to read.<br /><br />Bleh.	2005-06-24

My Spanish is bad, but since this is a Spanish-language novel, I'll give it a shot. (Estoy aprendiendo espa&ntilde;ol, pero escribo muy malo en espa&ntilde;ol.)<br />Es historia OK.

Pero, era una historia divertido. Cuatro estrellas. Quiz&aacute;s 3 1/2.<br />This was an OK story. I felt like the girl was far too dense -- constantly assuming that the guy couldn't possibly care for her, when it was so blatantly obvious to everyone else that he did. That is basically my main complaint. Ethan was an okay guy -- kind of clueless, a bit hypocritical and in denial -- but a lot of guys are like that, and they aren't bad guys. It was just that Arabella was far too dense. What did she need, a sledgehammer?<br />There were also far too many issues left unexplored or unexplained until the end of the book. A simple declaration of what was *really* going on could have cleared the air far sooner. But oh well. If that had happened the conflict and drama would have been over, and then it would have been a pretty dull book, now wouldn't it?	2004-06-22

I discovered this old Silhouette Romance in a dusty used bookstore, and what a treat it is. Without giving away too much of the plot, it revolves around a young woman who is an employee (editor, I believe) of the publishers of Silhouette Romance books. (Yes, we're talking about the same company that published this book!)<br />The hero is insecure and annoyed by the absurd fantasy of these books. His mom reads them, this woman he is interested in reads them, but these &quot;fantasy&quot; stories are full of strong, handsome, rich heroes with names like &quot;Thorne&quot; and &quot;Rock&quot; and how absurd is that? He is none of these things, he thinks, and so he feels that he cannot live up to this woman's expectations.<br />I really liked this book. There is more to this book than just the fact that this woman works for Silhouette Books, however, that detail amused me no end. Only Debbie Macomber could pull off a tale such as this!	2004-06-19

This was an okay book and I can tell that Brenda Jackson is a good writer. She's got a good sense of humor, a nice sense of pace and I probably am going to read her \\"sequels\\" to this book. But I have to be honest -- there should have been more room for something like, you know, a plot or more character development or more drama. Too many of the pages were used up describing more and more sex acts.<br />Yes, so I'm a bit of a prude, I admit it. But that's not really what my complaint is about. I've read other authors who are just about as explicit and \\"spicy\\" in their descriptions of lovemaking and I can deal with it if the rest of the story is gripping and engaging. But what made this book different was that so many pages were devoted to descriptions of sex and it seemed to me that the overall plot suffered because of it.<br />Okay, so maybe I overstate it a bit -- there was some plot in there, some conflict in there, sure. But over and over and over again, the same hot sex scenes, just a little different this time. Come on! I'd rather have read something more, you know, dramatic. Something that moved the plot along. Some more *action* of a different kind. But most of the story was set up in this isolated cabin, with these two people bursting at the seams with lust. It kind of got stale after a while, you know?<br />Not to say that I thought it was *that* bad. Like I said, it's obvious that Ms. Jackson is a skilled writer and she fleshed out the characters of Delany's brothers enough so I want to read about what happens to them in her following books. And I'm hoping that the next book I read will have, you know, a little more room for a *story*. That's all.	2004-06-08

There are examples of awkward and somewhat untidy rendering coupled with mediocre drawing skills. This combination does not make for a good art instruction book.<br />Colored pencil can easily look messy and blotchy (or uneven) if rendered improperly. There were definitely some examples of that here. Also, one would assume that a portrait book would show, well, portraits that were well-drawn. Nope, not here. Some have misaligned features which are rendered with little sensitivity.<br />There also seems to be a lack of understanding about how to use color as well. Some of the shadows and dark colors are \\"overkill\\" and too harsh for the face.<br />However, to be fair, a few of the portraits were not bad. Some portraits used a deliberate \\"light touch\\" with a more limited color scheme (one portrait in particular springs to mind) and these looked better.<br />There was also little actual *drawing* instruction. Sorry, but just teaching the graph or grid method isn't going to hack it. That's just one tool used for drawing, and it very easily can become a crutch of that's all an artist knows how to do. What about drawing from life? How can someone use a graph or grid to draw from life?<br />I understand that the author is a very encouraging teacher and that's great. But my goodness! This certainly is not the best colored pencil book out there. A *much* better choice would by any colored pencil book by the fabulous Bet Borgeson. Now *that's* colored pencil done right.	2003-12-23

The story and writing was quite competent, and I thought this was a nice tale in many ways. The main characters were engaging, the secondary characters (Jordan's brothers) were likeable. The plot moved along well and there was enough drama and conflict to make it a fairly interesting read.<br />Frankly, however, this book did not stand out as being all that remarkable or unique compared to other books in this genre. The thing that I believe made it distinctive was the *very* explicit (compared to other Harlequins) sex scenes. Very. Explicit.<br />Some readers who are not familiar with Foster's writing may be offended by her extremely spicy love scenes, others may not. In fact, most likely this writer is well-known for her explicit love scenes, and this may contribute to her apparent popularity -- though I confess I am not that familiar with her work (this was my first Lori Foster book).<br />To readers who could take or leave the explicit sex scenes (I consider myself in that category) then this is not the best choice in Harlequin Romances. There are far better writers (in my opinion) in this romance genre. However, for readers who enjoy the hot sex scenes and don't mind if the plot is only somewhat above average, this would be a good choice.	2002-11-17

Where am I? Oh! Oh, sorry about that, I was taking a little snooze. Reading \\"His Hometown Girl\\" made me nod off more than once.<br />I don't want to seem too unkind -- this was a \\"nice\\" book with a \\"nice\\" plot and \\"nice\\" people. Your 12 year old kid or your sheltered grandma could read it and never blush. That's got to be worth something, right?<br />And it had the seeds of a good story. The characters were likeable. The hero was a nice guy, how could you not like him? The heroine -- well, maybe she was a little dull, but still, she was a nice person, as was her grandma, and her sisters, and her horsey...<br />The problems with this book were:<br />Too long. I was ready to scream from boredom at 180 pages. Since it went on for about 240 pages this was a problem. It really should have been about 150 pages, tops. I am assuming the publisher requires all books from this line to be a certain length, so the author just padded the story until it was long enough.<br />Not enough drama or conflict. The dramatic elements were all there, too. The girl feels that she will never get more than a \\"lukewarm\\" love. She's got a depressed mom. There are close-minded townsfolk. There's a frowning and disapproving woman who was supposed to be the girl's future mother-in-law. The hero had plenty of his own drama as well -- his \\"from the wrong side of the tracks\\" background, his drunken mom, the judgment he perceives from the town because of his humble and sometimes embarassing roots. It's all there -- all the conflict and drama. But so much of it is barely allowed to be explored. Sure, there is some conflict in the last 30 pages or so, but that wasn't nearly enough drama to compensate for the tedium and boredom that came before.<br />Too much filler dialog. We read pages and pages of \\"sweet\\" and \\"cute\\" dialog between the hero and heroine. Sure, a certain amount of this dialog was fine, and it was (to a certain extent) written with finesse. But enough! Give us some drama! Some conflict! Some in-depth exploration of the characters! Come on!<br />I know this is from Harlequin's \\"Inspirational\\" line of romances.

I gave it two stars instead of one because the second story didn't grate on my nerves as much as the first one. But neither of them were very good.<br />First off, the \\"royal\\" thing seems phony and forced. Blech. Make us care, a little more, please. Because I didn't care about the royal angle in these stories. It didn't really push the plots along that much at all.<br />Secondly, the \\"Mary Poppins\\" character that pops in and out of these two sisters' lives is annoying. She's not in the stories enough for us to really understand her, she's just in there enough to irritate and interrupt. I didn't like her.<br />The first tale (\\"A Royal Mess\\") had a heroine that I didn't like very much. Oh, I found her tolerable eventually, but she seemed like a big pain for the most part. The story did have some strengths to it (I found the \\"pity pets\\" angle amusing) but for the most part, it just did not ring true to me.  The ending was laughably weak, and absurd. I cringed as I read it.<br />And, dare I say it? While I am accustomed to these kind of romance novels having love scenes that might be called \\"spicy\\" or \\"hot and sexy\\", the first tale's love scenes ventured a little too closely (in my estimation) into just plain \\"dirty\\". As  I read, I couldn't help thinking, \\"I'm reading a dirty book!\\" I guess it's a \\"Your mileage may vary\\" sort of thing (and I do admit to being a bit on the prudish side) but we all have our limits, and this book obviously pushed past mine.<br />The second tale was marginally better, with a heroine that was a little more comprehensible and not quite so annoying. The hero was OK, but I tired of hearing him described as a \\"badass cop\\" (oh puleeeeze) when his being a policeman really wasn't that huge of a part of the plot. Sure, it helped move along the beginning of the story, but he could have easily been a variety of other professions, and the story would have been just about the same.<br />The romance seemed forced, and \\"true love\\" came too quick. Too \\"fairy tale\\", even for a silly romantic comedy. And, did I mention, neither of these stories were all that funny? Because they weren't.airy tale\\", even for a silly romantic comedy.

It's important to read them in order, as certain events and characters are in both books.<br />Two brothers are challenged by their eccentric grandfather to complete a certain task (hold down a unique \\"career\\" for a month). Whoever does the best gets the family business.<br />In the first tale, \\"Operation Babe-Magnet\\", Dexter is the super-achiever geek bookworm. He must take on the \\"career\\" as a male escort--certainly the last job this uptight, shy fellow wanted to undertake! He ends up being hired to impersonate a popular self-help love author. In order to play the role, he is transformed into a super-fabulous hunk (\\"babe magnet\\"). He learns a lot along the way, and falls in love with the book's publicist.<br />In \\"Operation Beauty\\"  Dex's brother Sam has to go \\"undercover\\" in a lingerie company. Sam's job requires that he go in drag, however, which mortifies this super macho babe magnet greatly. And things get more complicated when a beautiful coworker asks Sam's \\"female counterpart\\" to share an apartment with her, and talk about \\"girly\\" things!<br />Sam hides behind a charming facade--he is a happy-go-lucky high school drop-out who has a \\"love 'em and leave 'em\\" attitude about women. The most charming part of this tale is when we discover why Sam is the way he is, and how he isn't really a superficial playboy, but rather a guy who is fervently trying to prevent anyone else from discovering his \\"secret\\".<br />I especially liked the way the author told both Sam and Dexter's story-- each brother has their own set of insecurities and world views. Each brother thinks the other has some special \\"advantage\\". In reality, both brothers are special and unique. Their tales are different and both equally charming. (I must confess, though -- I found Sam's story--and his deep dark \\"secret\\"--to make him particularly endearing.)<br />The two stories are wrapped up masterfully with a short little epilogue.

I just finished reading &quot;The Valentine Two-Step&quot; (a companion book to this one) so I decided to read this book as well. I enjoyed the characters, and it was nice seeing some &quot;familiar faces&quot; show up again in this book.<br />One thing I will say, this book fits a certain somewhat predictable formula, just like the &quot;Valentine Two-Step&quot; did. There is an underlying &quot;mystery&quot; that comes to a head by the end of the story. The same kind of affable character turns out to not be so affable after all (and we have fair warning of this beforehand) just like in &quot;Valentine&quot;. No shock or big surprise in any this. It's not hard to figure out &quot;who dunnit&quot; in both books.<br />I guess I am a little surprised that the author couldn't have made it a *little* harder for us to figure out the answer to the mystery. Did she have to follow the same exact formula (that was first seen in &quot;Valentine&quot;) in this book as well? It was painfully easy to see what was coming.<br />But still, this does not detract from the basic appeal of the book for general romance fans. It is what it is. A nice little romance tale.

Interesting and unique premise, with some suspense and danger mixed in. A definite page-turner. The writing was solid, and it kept me interested from the first page to the last.<br />I did find some of the dialogue at the ending (uttered by the villian) to be just *so* B-movie, though. I mean, come on. We're heard this all before in old re-runs of mystery and film noir flicks! I cringed a little at that. But still, that was a relatively minor issue.<br />My main concern was that this steadfast law officer could &quot;cross over the line&quot; into wholly inappropriate and unprofessional behavior with his female prisoner. Sure, he beat himself up over it, and sure, he kept on reminding himself that he shouldn't do it, BUT HE STILL DID IT. It was dumb, dumb, dumb, and in the Real World, it could have had serious consequences. In the Real World, only an imprudent and unprofessional man would have behaved in such a way.<br />Sure, since this is a romance novel, a fantasy, it makes for a juicier tale if he behaves in a certain way. But it was extremely dumb, and I lost a certain amount of respect for his character because he behaved in this way.<br />But, with that said, it was definitely a unique tale, and pretty decent read.	2002-10-30

A nice little story following the ups and downs and misunderstandings of a married couple on the brink of divorce. Very romantic and sweet.<br />However, I could not help but think that 184 pages of heart-wrenching domestic torment could have been resolved by one of the characters simply saying, &quot;Honey, I want kids.&quot; I mean, really! How difficult would that be to do? It was so painfully obvious that this was the main problem in their marriage.<br />But hey--if one of the characters had said that early in the story, there would be no story, would there?

I have been drawing for a long time (since I was 4). Drawing is a major influence and passion in my life, so I always am looking for new art books, and new perspectives on drawing. I consider this book to be an excellent addition to any artist's (or aspiring artist's) library.<br />Also, I once attended a class taught by one of Betty Edwards' students. It was such a helpful and inspiring class, and everyone improved dramatically. It was a wonderful class.<br />Even though I am no longer a drawing &quot;newbie&quot;, I found new insights and new ways to observe and see, thanks to this book. It truly can help new artists and &quot;non&quot; artists draw more accurately. It's amazing! Fabulous!<br />However, this book is not the ultimate book on drawing, and it should never be regarded as such. It cannot possibly answer every question, or provide every insight. It is only a first step. Drawing accurately is just one component to being an artist. (And I hasten to add, I'm REAL big on drawing accurately, I think it is important.) There is a lot of exploration and growth that each artist must undertake in order to fully develop. There will be further study of anatomy, color, line, etc. etc. This book does not pretend to teach everything, and no one should expect it to.<br />But, don't worry about that right away, if you are a &quot;newbie&quot;. Get the book, enjoy it, learn from it, and then look into other books. This book will give you that needed &quot;jump start&quot; and will help you gain a great deal of confidence. You will be most pleased with the progress you will be able to make, thanks to this book.	2002-04-30

That's because they teach you how to draw more freely, and because even though you may *think* you will never take your art more seriously, things can change in ways that you don't anticipate. And if they do change, and if you only ever followed what was in this book, you may end up regretting it, very bitterly, later.<br /><br />2) IF YOU INTEND TO STUDY THIS BOOK ALONG WITH SEVERAL OTHER GOOD BOOKS AND FOLLOW ALL OF THEM EQUALLY: Then again this book might not be so bad, because other books (like the aforementioned Betty Edwards and Bert Dodson books) will show you better and more well-rounded techniques, so at least you can make an informed choice about what path you want to follow.<br /><br />3) The author seems to be very enthusiastic about art, and also seems like a genuinely nice person. That shouldn't be underestimated. If she gets people interested in art, that isn't a bad thing, but again, refer to #1 and #2. There are other far better books that will give a more well-rounded introduction to drawing. If you like this book, fine, but please expose yourself to other techniques, unless you are completely certain you're never going to be anything other than a light hobbyist.<br /><br />With that out of the way, my reasons for giving the book 1 star still remain.<br /><br />First, some of the drawings are not very well drawn. There is a drawing of a bald person (in profile) that is simply awkwardly done and anatomically incorrect. Other drawings show similar lack of proportion and anatomical correctness. (I haven't seen the newer edition of this book, who knows, maybe the drawings have been improved.) The example artwork can be overblended, flat, and with unattractive features like each tooth outlined too heavily, so the portraits have people with ugly, somewhat dirty-looking teeth. A few portraits did look okay, however. (I liked the Ryan White portrait.)<br /><br />The blending pencil technique: This has become heavily overused, especially among newbies, and is the only method taught here. Additionally, it's not demonstrated well here. Some of the blending is flat and unattractive (like the too-dark lines between people's teeth).<br /><br />Many more experienced artists will remind the newcomer that blending graphite like this *because* you haven't learned the other ways of rendering pencil is a big mistake. In other words, don't decide to only do blending, just because you've never become comfortable drawing with pencil any other way. Look around you; you'll see all sorts of drawing and sketching techniques out there. Blending seems &#34;easiest,&#34; which is why beginners often use it. That's no reason to stick with it for forever!<br /><br />The grid method: Used by old master artists to transfer their sketches to a larger surface. But the old masters didn't use the grid to copy photos. The old masters did know how to draw freehand, and from life. (And even if you think that some of them didn't, there are plenty of artists living *today* who can. So there's really no reason to think that drawing freehand is beyond your ability. It's a skill that you can learn, and books like the Edwards and Dodson books can teach you that skill.) Or, to put it another way, using the grid occasionally, or using it when you're a new artist and gradually moving past it is one thing. Using it all the time, for every art project, is treating it like a crutch.<br /><br />This book rationalizes excessive grid use by saying that the old masters used it (which is a misrepresentation of their use of the grid.) Thanks to books and tutorials like this, I personally know of many artists who never learned how to draw without it, which means they in essence *can't* really draw (freehand). This can potentially lead to lots of problems and perhaps some embarrassment. Non-artists expect us to be able to draw something right on the spot. The thought that some of us are unable to actually draw never crosses their minds. And, many teachers will expect students to work from a live model. Those who only copy with grids will not be able to keep up. There are a lot of situations where being too dependent on the grid can come back to haunt artists.<br /><br />So in conclusion, if you take pride in your work and someday dream of being better, AND, *if* you have difficulty drawing without the grid or are uncomfortable drawing unless you can blend your pencil strokes, then you're creating a problem for yourself. Don't let your pride or your fear of failure prevent you from moving from the comfort zone of grid+blending graphite.se by saying that the old masters used it (which is a misrepresentation of their use of the grid.)

But this book did not disappoint. It is a very nice book.<br />The artist indeed has a true grasp on how to draw the portrait. He gives several very detailed step-by-step lessons, which are very helpful.  He also  illustrates and explains to the reader things like: the different shapes of the head, feature placement, and more. He makes a sincere attempt to educate to the artist on what the face is about.<br />One of the most important things to note is the excellence of the artwork. All the likenesses are spot-on. It is a delight to see a book full of very nice artwork! This is an essential element as far as I am concerned. If the author is a poor artist, why should I believe anything they are trying to teach me?<br />I do have a problem with some of the smaller sketches. They were fine, but lacked a little detail. Also, a few of the features on these small sketches got a little &quot;wonky&quot; (crooked eyes, etc.) But these were minor things. Obviously this artist is very capable, and really understands how to get a likeness.<br />It is also important to note that this book will actually help an artist *enhance* their drawing and observation skills. It  illustrates and explains the true fundimentals of looking for a likeness, how to &quot;plot out&quot; the placement of the features, how to *understand* the face. This is the most important key to getting a good likeness. This is a far more preferable way of learning portraits than just mindlessly copying by using mechanical aids like tracing, or the &quot;grid&quot;. Those methods may be preferred by some because they are &quot;simpler&quot;, but they will not assist the artist in developing their drawing skills, or in truly understanding what makes a likeness. They will also not assist an artist in learning how to draw from life. The only way to truly get an evocative and convincing likeness is to *understand* the face, not just copy shadows and shapes.<br />This is a medium-sized book, and cannot be expected to cover all the details of drawing the portrait. But it is quite delightful,  in its own way.s to *understand* the face, not just copy shadows and shapes.<br />This is a medium-sized book, and cannot be expected to cover all the details of drawing the portrait.

US	52595452	R24FA0GIR9WER8	1581800991	427151229	How to Draw Portraits in Colored Pencil from Photographs	Books	1	24	35	N	N	It would help if the author was a good artist.	I've created (and sold) countless portrait drawings and paintings through the years, and I love drawing portraits. I was expecting that with all this good feedback, this book would be something special. I was appalled.<br />I'm sorry, but the drawings just weren't very good. There was one portrait in particular (of a young African American boy) that was truly warped. The features mishapen, the rendering, shading and color were all off. Actually, all the artwork in this book is rather amateurish. Some of the artwork was a little better, but generally, it was decidedly mediocre. The colored pencil techniqe isn't good either. I confess that I lose respect for an art instruction book when the art examples in the book are rather bad.<br />And then there's the \\"grid\\" thing, which is the *only* drawing method taught in this book. Sure, it is a good learning aid, and is useful in many ways. But other drawing techniques (like freehand drawing) should be learned, so that the artist can have some measure of freedom and flexibility. The grid method is way too limiting to be used exclusively. It can almost be something like a \\"crutch\\", if an artist never moves past it. (Always having to draw those squares, squares, squares on everything! Yikes!)<br />That's why it's too bad that this book only covers the grid method. Most artists will discover that as their skills develop, they will eventually want to start drawing from life, (or eventually even draw things from their imagination). They'll never learn any of that from this book. Get Betty Edwards' drawing book, if you want to learn more about how to *really* draw. This book doesn't cover a fraction of it. And for colored pencil techniques, get Bet Borgeson's fabulous colored pencil books. She's absolutely marvelous.<br />I'm glad that this book helped other people, and I'm sure there must be something good in it (though I couldn't see where. I guess I was too blinded by the mediocre artwork). But there are FAR better drawing and colored pencil books out there.nd colored pencil books out there.	2002-03-07

This is an exquisite book. The drawings are utterly fabulous, but the text and &quot;teaching illustrations&quot; are also outstanding. The author has such a friendly and accessable way of writing, his text is a joy to read. Every bit of it has value - no fluff here. I even learned a lot from his drawing material recommendations! (I have been pretty settled on what drawing papers I use, but after reading his chapter on it, I went out and got new drawing pads!)<br />It's an absolute treasure. The artwork is brilliant, and gorgeous. A must-have for any library.	2002-03-07

I am sorry to be so harsh, but the first illustrations I noticed in this book were of the face. And they were BAD.<br />Awkward and amatuerish.<br />There was one detailed illustration of an eye (showcased because I assume the author was proud of the drawing) and it was *wretched*. The eye was creepy-looking, the iris looked loopy, the pupil was lopsided and not round. (Irises and pupils are supposed to be *round*.)  Come on. There is no excuse for an author of a drawing book to not understand this basic thing about the human eye. There's *especially* no excuse when this artist is writing a BOOK about drawing people! Give me a break. The other drawings of the face were also pretty horrid.  Oh, I suppose they are marginally OK if you want to draw comic books, but *not* OK if you want to understand the actual anatomy and structure of the head.<br />I don't doubt that there is some useful information about anatomy in this book. But I was completely turned off by the BAD drawings. So, only one star from me.<br />There are plenty of other good anatomy books out there, written by artists who actually can draw well. (Burne Hogarth, George Bridgman, or Louis Gordon, for starters.) Try one of their books instead.	2002-03-05

I am learning new things left and right.  I am very happy I got this book.<br />I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it's a bit of a slim book for the price.  Try to get a discount price on it if possible.  And - don't expect to be amazed by *every* tip.  Some of them probably will not be new to you.  But it's still definitely worth a look.

All keyboard shortcuts, the CD (there was at least one file that wouldn't open in my Mac) and all instructions.  The author takes pains to give step-by-step instructions for certain tasks, like &quot;Go to your C Drive&quot;, etc. etc.  This information is utterly *useless* for the Mac user, since no such instructions are given for the Mac platform.  It's like the Mac doesn't exist in the author's universe.  Sorry, we do exist, and we do buy Dreamweaver books. Really!<br />It is true, many functions are identical in Mac *and* PC, so a lot of the step-by-step instructions given in the book will be the same on either platform.  But not all functions are the same.  And it does begin to grate after a while, to see that apparently it never even occurred to the author to aknowledge this.  So, if you are a &quot;newbie&quot; Mac user and really need step-by-step instructions for *everything*, be warned.  DON'T BUY  THIS BOOK!  It is certainly NOT meant for you.<br />I paid a lot of money for this book.  I expect that I should be able to use every bit of it.  I am utterly astonished that the publisher and author did not try to cater to as many potential customers as possible.  It would have taken very little extra effort to make at least some feeble *stab* at acknowledging Mac users, (on the CD, at least) but no such attempt was made.  Why?  Doesn't the author realize that many Mac users are design-oriented, and are big Dreamweaver users?  Why alienate even a small portion of your potential patrons?  I am confused.  I have bought *many* design-related software books (for Photoshop, etc.) and never, NEVER have I seen one neglect the Mac contingent.  Never.<br />If Macromedia didn't care about the Mac platform, they'd have never developed a Mac version of Dreamweaver. Too bad the author of this book forgot that..	2001-08-08

I really liked Scott Kelby's &quot;Down and Dirty&quot; Photoshop book, so I thought I'd better get this.  It's excellent as well.  It's rather a slim book, but packed full of good information.<br />It does have some very basic stuff in it (like using the clone stamp) but it has more advanced/intermediate information in it as well.  I learned some exciting new Photoshop techniques the first time I opened the book!  It is an excellent book to thumb through while you are in front of your computer.  Lots of good advice, and fun easy tips!<br />This book would be *excellent* for the beginner/intermediate Photoshop user, who wants some &quot;instant results&quot; to some common problems and challenges.  (I cannot speak for the more advanced Photoshop user, since I'm not one!)  But certainly, a less experienced user will find MUCH to help them in this book.<br />I consider it to be a great companion book to one of the larger, more comprehensive &quot;Bible&quot;-type Photoshop books.  I don't feel it would in any way replace one of those kind of books, though.  But it will give many people some great new ideas, and give them a &quot;jump start&quot; if they feel they are stagnating in their Photoshop knowledge!<br />Another great thing about this book (as well as the &quot;Dirty Secrets&quot; book) is that it introduces the user to new tools, techniques, keyboard shortcuts, etc., while in the process of going through the tutorials.  You may *think* you are just learning one specific &quot;trick&quot; or technique, but you end up taking away some fabulous new Photoshop techniques that you will use in other areas.  You will find that this book will expand your understandng of Photoshop in ways you didn't expect!<br />The instructions are easy to understand, and the illustrations helpful.  The writing is written in an easy, friendly manner, which makes it an accessable book for any user.	2001-07-07

I got my first Mac ever about a year and a half ago, being a PC person before that. Being a book fanatic, I used this Mac purchase as an excuse to go out and buy lots of Mac books! The Mac Bible was one of the first I bought. It still remains the book I consult most often.<br />I found it had an absolutely fabulous &quot;history of Mac&quot; section, so I was able to catch up on all the Macs through history. I was keenly interested in that, and still am. I love to read about the old LCs, and such. (Yes, I'm a pathetic geek.)<br />But there's more to that to this book. Just lots of explanations on OS features, different kinds of problems you'll encounter, and some of the best software to use on a Mac. It has a great index, so you can find the information you need quickly. I have it by my Mac at all times. What would I do without it?<br />I can't explain it - this book has EVERYTHING. I read it eagerly (I even had it before I got my Mac! I ordered the Mac, and read this book while waiting for it to arrive.) This book helped me adjust to the world of Mac-dom very quickly.

I just had a problem with a few details in the beginning, and more than a few problems with the ending.  But not everyone will share my feelings, I am sure.  It's a matter of taste, and opinion.  I have read the Austen book countless times, am rather devoted to it.  But I also enjoyed both TV miniseries ('96 and '79) and am capable of being a little flexible about the plot and storyline of this wonderful book.<br />I definitely could tell (and it is obvious from the author's own acknowledgements) that this book is primarily inspired by Colin Firth's portrayal of Darcy in the '96 A&amp;E miniseries.  Which is fine as far as I'm concerned.  I liked Firth, and the A&amp;E production brought out a more &quot;earthy&quot; Darcy - which really grew on me after a while.  Though I hasten to add that Darcy isn't as &quot;earthy&quot; in Austen's book.  (And I have to admit, I am very fond of the '79 series, with David Rintoul's fabulous, icy-cool Darcy.  I feel like it followed the book far more religiously.)<br />I guess my main objection to the ending of the book (after the wedding) was that there was TMI.  Too Much Information!  There was too much detail about the honeymoon, and the passionate side of their marriage.  Hey - I have no problem believing that Darcy and Elizabeth had a passionate and happy love life, but I couldn't see Jane Austen's Darcy actually writing such details in his diary.  Ever.  (Granted, these &quot;details&quot; were more PG-13 rated, and downright tasteful compared to most romance novels being written these days!)  But still, seeing them disclosed in Darcy's diary like that - it did not ring true with me.<br />I also found certain details about the characters to be, well, out of character.  A certain amount of things I was able to accept, because I believed that Darcy was (at heart) as &quot;earthy&quot; as the A&amp;E TV version.  But a few things just pushed the envelope too far.<br />However, I did enjoy the middle of the book, where Darcy meets Elizabeth, their courtship, etc.  I found the author's insights on *his* thoughts to be quite enlightening.  When reading the middle of the book, I often found myself thinking, &quot;Of course!  Of COURSE he was thinking that!&quot;  I really enjoyed most of the author's &quot;spin&quot; on what he was thinking, and usually felt she had it just right.  And, I did appreciate some of the details given about his childhood, since they did seem to explain why he was so &quot;proud&quot;, and uptight.  I only had a few problems with the beginning part of the book.<br />All-in-all, it was a nice read.  I think the author is capable, and talented.  However, if you are devoted utterly to the Austen novel, and cannot bear any kind of deviation from it, then this is not the book for you.  If you are familiar with the original book, but absolutely love the A&amp;E series, you'll like it better.  If you are a big romance novel fan, you will like it even more!  But you need to be familiar with the original story.

(It's kind of hard to drag an iMac to work every day, so I just bring the book!)<br />The tutorials are fun, and I feel like the author is there with me, urging me on.  Everything is clear and easy to understand.  There is a definite sense of humor in the book which I enjoy, though I understand that not everyone will.  I do admit that I am not a big fan of emoticons, or cute little abbreviations like &lt;lol&gt; or &lt;gr&gt; (which mean &quot;laugh out loud&quot; and &quot;grin&quot;) and I would not miss them if they were removed from this book.  But hey - that is a small annoyance, and does not detract from the immense value and friendliness of this book.<br />This is a Mighty Fine Photoshop book.  I am on the newbie side when it comes to Photoshop, and I am finding it very helpful in pushing me to the &quot;intermediate&quot; stage in Photoshop expertise.  The bundled CD is great as well.	2001-04-15

For some reason I resisted buying this book for a while, but one day, on impulse, I did.  I am very glad I did.  I have not finished it yet, but so far, I am impressed.  The writing is in a clear style  that is easy to understand, and it covers other important aspects to Photoshop (and digital imaging-related topics) that I haven't seen in my other Photoshop books.  It has ample images and screenshots, all in the appropriate places, which makes learning and understanding easier.  Also, there is a &quot;troubleshooting&quot; feature scattered throughout the book, where the author answers commonly encountered problems.  I discovered many answers to things I had been wondering about, while just thumbing through this book!  I am really glad I bought this book on impulse, I think I made a wise choice.<br />Another thing that impresses me - the special website for users of this book, ps6.com.  (Any Photoshop user can access most of the site, though.)  It has the sample files you'll want to use when going through some of the book's step-by-step tutorials.  (No need for a bundled CD, the sample files are on the site!  You will need a password that is found in the book to get to the images, though.) I really was impressed that the author took the trouble to have a special site for this book's readers.  The author seems committed to his readers, and in providing a helpful, comprehensive and informative book.	2001-04-13

I figured that the people that published the book, NAPP, had to have something good going for them!<br />It's a GREAT book. I still need to learn *a lot* more about Photoshop (though I use it a lot) and I decided that I needed to push myself a bit to advance my skills.  So, I got several Photoshop books, including this one.  The other more &quot;basic&quot; books were needed, and helpful, but this book really got me excited!  I find I am learning all sorts of little details about Photoshop (new keyboard shortcuts, new functions, new features) from this book!  Not only am I learning the &quot;tricks&quot; (which are great fun) but I am also learning Photoshop BETTER in the process.<br />If you are a bit of a Photoshop newbie, you owe it to yourself to get this book.  You will have fun, and you will find yourself becoming more well-rounded in Photoshop!	2001-03-31

I was fortunate to be one the many students of Hogarth when he taught figure drawing in Los Angeles.  He was a remarkable teacher, and his drawing style, and teaching style, is certainly \\"dynamic\\".  All his books are great, but \\"Dynamic Figure Drawing\\" is a particular favorite.  While you may find Hogarth's comic book roots not to your taste (and you don't want to have your art look too \\"Hogarth\\") - don't deprive yourself of his books.  He has much to offer, and many details about the figure that are very valuable.  My drawing has been forever impacted and improved because of what he taught me - in class and from his books.<br /><br />Just because you absorb much from his books (and you will) it doesn't follow that you will adopt his \\"comic book\\" style as well.  Learn from him, and many other artists' works, and consider yourself well-rounded!	2001-03-24

I have a job with a lot of &quot;reading time&quot;, so I bring books to work.  This book was GREAT for studying at work - the illustrations helped me grasp new concepts and techniques about Photoshop, without having my computer in front of me!  The book is lavishly illustrated (hence the &quot;visually&quot; in the title) and this is a great learning aid.  A lot of the information stuck in my brain because I could see a visual reference in the book.  It's also a good book to just thumb through, and find out how to use a new technique.<br />I wouldn't want to rely on it as my *only* Photoshop book, but I found it to be a great study aid.  I intend to get the Photoshop 6 edition, since I have recently upgraded my software.  The only downside to this book is that all the screenshots are of Windows!  Since I use my Mac for most Photoshop work, I wasn't crazy about all the Windows screenshots - but I survived!  ;-)	2001-03-15

I mean, it explains some very basic things about the web, color, fonts, stuff like that.  Things I already knew.  But hey - not everyone knows this stuff yet - we all have to learn sometime!  So if you feel like you are a total newbie, this is a very nice book.  It makes no assumptions about what you know about Adobe products, internet applications - well, anything.  You won't feel overwhelmed with a lot of complicated technical information with this book.<br />It's a good book, just mostly for beginners.	2001-03-15
