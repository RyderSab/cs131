Dory Lambert was living a privileged life and nursing a life-long crush on the chauffeur's son (who has eyes only for her sister, Jill) when her father was accused of fraud.  Suddenly Dory finds herself poor and struggling to keep her family's estate intact for her aunt.  Her idea to turn their estate into an exclusive hotel works perfectly and things are finally turning around for her when Chase, the aforementioned chauffeur's son, returns. <br /> <br />Chase McKay has a little bit of a chip on his shoulder.  The family his father worked for all of his life sent him away to college after he was caught in a compromising position with Jill, their daughter.  Now worth upwards of 9 figures, Chase has returned to his childhood home be with his ailing father, who he hopes to convince to retire and come live with him. <br /> <br />This is the first Lynn Michaels book I've ever read.  I decided to give it a try because she's been around for a while and I thought, hey, why not?  Anyone who's published that many books has to be pretty good, right?  Wrong. <br /> <br />\\"Honeymoon Suite\\" is written in what I'd describe as a Susan Elizabeth Phillips style.  We follow the heroine around for a few years before we get to the meat of the romance.  The problem is that instead of the early years being a time where we see Dory developing into a character who needs someone like Chase in her life, we're really just being told the sob story about Dory's family losing their money.  We have to follow the whole Lambert clan through their overblown reaction to their circumstances, and I am bored to tears. <br /> <br />The romance itself barely begins before it stalls for nearly half the book while Chase picks up where he left off chasing after Dory's sister Jill and eventually marrying her.  He seems to be living out this adolescent fantasy about proving everyone wrong or something.  And we're supposed to believe he's an intelligent high-powered businessman!  Dory is in sadly unrequited lovewith this moron and we're supposed to hope that she eventually ends up with him.  She's such a martyr, though, I suppose we shouldn't be surprised she'd want someone who seemed incapable of appreciating her.  Dory has to sacrifice everything to save her family, she forgets about having a social life for basically all of her twenties because she's too busy looking after everything, she has to take in the orphaned child and raise him as her own, she has to be worshipped like a goddess by the household staff for whom she'd do anything.  It's just ridiculous. <br /> <br />I give this book 1 star because that's as low as I can go.  Too many characters, the over-baked loss of money storyline, an unlikable hero, a far too good to be true heroine, and some of the most boring pacing in the world make this book something you'll want to avoid like the plague. <br />	2005-02-09

Actually I think this is the first one I've ever read intentionally (I thought, hey, medieval vampire story, sounds cool).  Anyway, I can't say with any authority that this IS an original vampire story because I don't read them often enough, but it certainly felt new and fresh to me. <br /> <br />Simon was a young, idealistic Crusader devoted to his liege lord.  Ambushed and attacked at his lord's wedding by a castle full of vampires, Simon is the only survivor of his group.  Not by chance, but because he is a ruthless and dedicated warrior.  He is \\"turned\\" by the vampire leader Lucan Kivar.  Though he defeats Kivar, he is cursed to the life of a vampire, and embarks on a quest at the urging of his lord's intended bride Roxanna who had also been turned and by the wizard Orlando (who happens to be a dwarf).  Simon is to find \\"the Chalice\\" which can cure vampires. <br /> <br />Isabel is the orphaned mistress of Castle Charmot.  At age 26, she has cleverly avoided the machinations of the king and the would be suitors he has sent her way.  Her father's aging knight has helped her to keep her independence by playing the part of the \\"Black Knight\\" who challenges any suitors and bests them, but he is growing to old to protect her any longer and so Isabel prays for true Black Knight to rescue her. <br /> <br />In writing out premise for this novel I feel like I'm not doing justice to the story.  It's a well planned and very believable tale.  Blue's prose is clean and sharp, with no fluff.  And does she ever use it effectively, beautifully shaping her characters with some of the best \\"show, not tell\\" characterization I've ever seen in a romance.  If you're looking for the heavy-handed, infantile typical romance novel means of revealing the characters' personalities, this is not the book for you.  I'm so sick of having authors tell me how independent a heroine is--I want to be shown.  Don't tell me fifty times that the hero is tortured--let his actions and thoughts speak for themselves.  Blue does just that, and does it very well. <br /> <br />Simon comes to Castle Charmot ten years into his quest, believing that the Chalice (or a clue to its whereabouts) is there.  He's been living like a vampire, and trying to keep from killing the innocent, but he does feed on humans from time to time.  I realize that the whole \\"tortured hero\\" thing is pretty much stock for a vampire hero, but he just feels so real to me.  There's nothing contrived about him.  He's not perfect, but he tries to do the right thing--and unlike so many vampire heroes he's not trying to do good because he's been converted by the virgin heroine's innocence of by some silly supernatural interference, he fights his vampire nature and wins most of the time.  When he meets Isabel he starts falling for her almost immediately, and I really like that, when there's no silly, contrived reason the hero won't make a move for the heroine.  Simon is just wonderful in his angst-ridden love for Isabel. <br /> <br />Isabel is a great heroine.  She really is independent (for years she's gotten by on her own), but she's not afraid to seek help when she needs it (none of this \\"I must do it on my own or become a martyr!\\" business with Isabel).  She's practical, she's smart, and she's willing to be ruthless to achieve her goals. <br /> <br />Kivar returns to play the villain and causes mostly believable havoc for our protagonists.  He's fairly one dimensional in his evil, but a horror setting is one place I'm willing to overlook simplistic villain characterization.  Pushing our lovebirds through the story toward what is a remarkably good ending.  No over-the-top fairy tale epilogue for Simon and Isabel--oh no, they're together, but still fighting for their happily ever after. <br /> <br />\\"My Demon's Kiss\\" isn't perfect.  There's a plot hole or two (Roxanna & Orlando; and the man Simon turns into a vampire) that are really lead-ins for future books.  I don't mind that, but I'm not a fan of introducing things like that in what should be a stand-alone book and then leaving them hanging.  Isabel gets a little ditzy for the sake of some plot twists toward the end, but I'm willing to forgive it.  Also, Isabel's mother died when she was born, but Isabel is alarmingly uninformed about her mother which doesn't really fit in with the sharp sort of character she is.  And then there's Simon whose dream has been to return to Ireland, the country of his birth, but he never gets there and it seems he never will...so why introduce it at all?  But oh well, these are small quibbles with what is otherwise a very good book. <br /> <br />A great and refreshing read, \\"My Demon's Kiss\\" is a must buy for all romance fans.  I give it four stars, about the highest rating I ever give, and anxiously await Ms. Blue's (who apparently has written under the name listed for the copyright, Jayel Wylie, as well) next installment.	2005-01-11

My sister made me buy this book because the heroine's name is her nickname.  I bought and read at her insistence. <br /> <br />Jenny Penny is a lady's maid with a weakness for the finer things in life.  When the niece of her employers dresses her up like a lady and drags her before the highlander who stole her breath earlier in the day, Jenny finds herself playing the part of a lady to Callum, Viscount Argyll.  Moonlighting as Lady Eros, selling her wildly popular face cream (for which people have found a different use), Jenny's life soon gets wild and crazy. <br /> <br />I don't really know where to begin with my review.  This book is written like a chick lit novel, which makes it difficult to review in the style I normally use for a historical romance.  Jenny is the center of the story, the entire book being told from her point of view.  This might have worked if she'd been a better character.  She's what would happen if the Shopaholic and Becky Sharp mated--and not in a good way.  She's got all of the surface angst of a real character, but in execution she's shallow and lacks self awareness.  There's just no depth to her at all. <br /> <br />I don't feel like I know the hero.  In fact, I'm not even sure what he looks like.  You can be sure I have no idea why he falls in love with Jenny.  The endearing parts of her story and character are only revealed to the readers, not to the hero.  Actually, I'm not all that sure why Jenny loves Callum either.  The romance, like Jenny, lacks depth. <br /> <br />\\"Lady in Waiting\\" just feels like a silly story, and it only gets two stars from me.  The characters aren't three dimensional, Jenny's predicaments and shopping addictions are wallpaper, and the hero is a non-entity.  This book reminds me of the work of other authors, but falls short because the characters aren't good.  I'll try to explain what I mean: Julia Quinn's light-hearted stories work because her characters have soul; you root for Pamela Britton's working classheroines because they feel real, flaws and all; Karen Marie Moning's rompy tales are never a joke because her protagonists have chemistry dripping from every pore; Lisa Kleypas's flawless characterization makes you fall in love with everyone she writes. <br /> <br />I'd like to be clear, Caskie is a capable writer.  Her prose has tightened since her debut and she has really trimmed down on the over-the-top gags.  I'm glad to see that the horribly irritating match-making Featherton sisters have been reigned in and made more palatable.  But in the end this is just a mediocre effort.  I have the oddest feeling that the author doesn't have a real understanding of what makes good romance.  I can be hard on the genre, but deep down I have deep affection for it.  I think the same is true of the greatest romance authors.  Somehow, I get the feeling Caskie has a lack of respect for the genre and its readers.  If she'd rather be writing literary fiction or maybe even romance's more glamorous cousin, chick lit, that's what she should do.	2005-01-07

Morganna \\"Morgan\\" KilCreggar is orphaned young thanks to a clan feud, and left mostly to her own devices.  She lives life as a boy, training herself to have assassin-like skills with daggers and a bow and arrow.  Robbing dead bodies with a small band of village boys, Morgan manages to scrape by.  Until one day, on an abandoned battlefield, she tries to rob the body of a man who isn't dead. <br /> <br />Quickly recognizing the \\"boy\\" Morgan's intelligence and deadly skills with various weapons, Alexander \\"Zander\\" FitzHugh forces Morgan to be his squire as punishment for trying to rob him and for being a robber of the dead.  The younger son of a Highland laird, Zander has made a name for himself as a warrior and pseudo-political figure (he's a fourteenth century Robert The Bruce contemporary) promoting the unification of Scotland.  Using \\"Squire Morgan\\" to continue his mission to gain allies in as many clans as possible, Zander is somewhat astounded to find himself attracted to his male squire. <br /> <br />I like a gender-bending medieval heroine once in a while and that along with the fact that this is another of Zebra's $3.99 debuts prompted me to give Ms. Ivie a try.  I was not disappointed. <br /> <br />So often, the \\"girl dressed as a boy\\" thing doesn't work because the author isn't willing to commit her character completely to the role--Ms. Ivie side-stepped that mistake quite handily.  Morgan really lives as a boy.  She's tough, she's deadly, and she thinks she can do anything.  I love her; she's awesome.  I think she's the best gender-bending heroine ever. <br /> <br />Then there's the romance.  Ms. Ivie whole-heartedly committed to making it feel real.  Zander falls in love with Morgan truly believing she's a boy.  Truly!  I love it!  We see the real struggles of a religious fourteenth century man \\"realizing\\" he's gay, thinking he'll go to hell if he acts on his feelings, but totally going for the love of his life anyway.  This is absolutely perfect.  I cannot applaud this enough!  And you really believe that Zander doesn't know that Morgan is a girl, because she totally does NOT act like a girl.  So rarely in a romance does an author really go for the jugular with inner struggles; so rarely does a historical romance author embrace what would have truly been a character's religious and cultural beliefs, not letting them be transparently modern in their beliefs; so rarely is a romance author willing to step outside the normal bounds of having an unquestionably feminine heroine and an unquestionably alpha, headstrong hero. <br /> <br />Naturally, Zander's clan is the one Morgan's clan was feuding with, and of course at first Morgan intends to kill him.  Then she starts to fall for him and her plans change.  Her internal conflict doesn't quite have the emotional impact of Zander's, but it is believable.  Meanwhile \\"Squire Morgan's\\" skills are becoming legendary, and Morgan's fame begins to eclipse Zander's to the point that she becomes a national hero. <br /> <br />Somewhere about two-thirds of the way through the book the romance begins to resolve itself and the book starts to run out of steam.  Then we have stereo-typical historical romance situations.  Morgan starts to turn a little too feminine a little too fast once the cat's out of the bag on her masquerade.  And, Zander starts to turn into a less-likable, domineering male.  Things don't fall utterly apart, but they do become more conventional which leaves me a little less than thrilled. <br /> <br />In the end, I give \\"Lady Of The Knight\\" three stars.  It probably deserves more than three, because there's a lot that's excellent about it.  Unfortunately the book's problems hold me back from rating it any higher.  On top of the loss of momentum, there are far too many secondary characters, the laughingly predictable usage of historical figures, clichd romance novel circumstances, and a villain who too neatly wraps up the original plot.  Don't get me wrong, I think this book is worth reading, but I'm not blind to its flaws.  If you like medievals, and especially if you like gender-bending heroines, this story is for you.	2005-01-02

Jill Strathern just caught her husband, pants down, with his secretary.  Inexplicably fired the same day from the San Francisco law firm they both work for, Jill leaves her husband and the lifestyle she loves behind to go work in a small practice in her hometown. <br /> <br />Mac Kendrick is recently divorced and trying to maintain joint custody of his eight year old daughter.  He's recently moved home from the big city to become sheriff of his small hometown.  He has his daughter, Emily, on a trial basis for the summer. <br /> <br />I can't decide what this book wants to be.  It's like the author started with a premise instead of a plot and just let the story meander from there.  I can't really say for sure since I couldn't finish the book. <br /> <br />Jill moves in with her eccentric, psychic aunt next door to Mac.  Way back when Jill turned eighteen she dropped her dress and offered herself to Mac and he promptly threw up.  She's scarred, or whatever.  He doesn't remember it because he was drunk.  Anyway, we're supposed to believe that Jill never lost her crush on him and is ready to pick things right up where she left off.  Mac is even more unfathomable, he just starts kissing Jill and I have no real idea why other than that he thinks she's hot.  The relationship development is really adolescent. <br /> <br />As you might have guessed this book is a sales pitch for small town life.  We've got the ridiculous mayor, Jill's nutty legal clients, the wonder-woman police dispatcher granny, the over-eager boy scout social worker, Jill's hostile secretary, etc.  Everyone's a character--more like a caricature. <br /> <br />Mac's drama with his daughter is boring.  This little girl keeps having creepy \\"bad feelings inside\\".  I want to wretch. <br /> <br />Jill's mob boss client shows up from San Francisco to add more \\"drama\\" (because we needed more characters I guess?  isn't there a formula for the number of characters that can successfully be introduced in a four hundred page novel?)  Jill's other clients are page fillers, most likely to distract readers from the fact that the romance has zero chemistry. <br /> <br />I got about halfway through the book before I decided to give up.  Let's just say I finally realized it was never going to get any better.  It was just boring; boring and eye-roll inducing.  Being a small town girl, I don't mind the small town thing if it's done well, if the characters are people you can care about, if *gasp* the central romance is good.  This book just wasn't much of anything. <br /> <br />In the end, I give \\"Someone Like You\\" one star.  This is not a good book, but I wouldn't be surprised to find out this author is capable of better, because her prose and style don't really lack anything.  Anyone else sucked in by the back blurb, be ware--this book isn't what it masquerades itself to be. <br />	2004-10-26
US	17963721	RIA16BB93SE9X	0843952210	414558860	The Fall	Books	1	20	28	N	N	Big fall for Dain.	Juliane Le Gel married young as she was instructed.  Things went wrong, however, when the witness of the consummation of her marriage told the tale that, though she was obedient and submissive in the bedchamber, Juliane's husband couldn't rise to the occasion and breach her maidenhead.  Because the marriage couldn't be finalized with consummation, Juliane was divorced from her husband.  Given a reprieve, as she saw it, from the hardship of marriage, Juliane built a reputation for herself as the \\"Frost Fair\\".  The legend was that though many men had tried to win her, none could keep from \\"withering\\" when she looked at them.    Ulrich of Caen is a [illegitimate] born knight with a reputation for the ladies.  He comes to Juliane's home with a couple of his buddies to try to \\"melt the ice\\" of the legendary Juliane.    I find myself writing this review in a very stilted manner, and can't help but think that it's because I've been damaged by the heavy medieval style in which this tale is told.  This is not the first Dain book I've read, and she's usually very good at helping to create a tone for her book with her prose.  If she's writing Puritans and Pirates, it feels like a book about Puritans and Pirates.  If she writes a Western, let me tell you, it feels like a Western.  Normally if she writes a medieval, it really feels like a medieval.  This feels like a medieval, but one written by a Victorian author.  \\"The Fall\\" is too vague, too wordy, too artificial to work.  I had to force myself through the first fifty pages, the whole time shaking my head in disbelief that this could be a Claudia Dain book--often I slide along so easily in her prose that I find myself reading a whole book in one sitting.  That was simply not the case this time around.    Juliane isn't really frigid.  She's just been skillful about creating an aura of it around herself.  Employing servants, family members, and even animals in her quest to have a cold shower affect on every man she meets.  Sureshe was successful, but by the end of the book I have myself wondering why.  The whole basis of the legend was a lie, Juliane's first marriage was consummated, she's not a virgin, but her husband was convinced to go along with the story and walk away from her by her father for reasons that are never really revealed and therefore seem fantastical.  Why would her husband walk away?    Also, Juliane's set up is as a strong heroine, and she is strong, but she's also a little dumb and emotionally ignorant.  She's totally blind to the true feelings and machinations of an uncle who likes to meddle.  It's apparent that she's into Ulrich, but she resists him like crazy for a reason that feels really false--she says she doesn't want him to know her legend is a lie or something to that effect.  She runs off after their wedding and gets herself \\"intimately violated\\" (yes, actually \\"intimately violated\\") just because she's trying to prove that Ulrich doesn't control her or something.  I just don't really like her.    Ulrich has baggage, as even medieval rakes are wont to do.  He has no money or land, and decides to marry Juliane when she's offered to him (because her father thinks she's the man for him just because he can get it up--even though the father knows the whole frigid thing is a myth) so that he can take the land he'll get and make the son he already has heir to it.  Yeah.  Juliane's own children will be landless and penniless so that Ulrich's [illegitimate] son can have the only estate they're given.  Never would a medieval woman's family have made such a match for her, knowing that.  Typical romance author mistake, though, we see this sort of thing all of the time.  People forget the main consideration of arranged marriages was not furthering the interests of the two people marrying so much as it was furthering the prospects of any products of the union, and therefore the importance of both families involved.  Sorry, tangent.    Anyway, these two, somewhere in the middle of the strange little \\"game\\" of courtly love they're playing fall in love.  Then (and here's the thing that really made the book a total loss for me), they consummate their marriage two days after she was brutally \\"intimately violated\\".  Yeah.  And it's a full blown \\"we're having the best sex of our lives\\" sex scene.  Okay you haven't heard the worst yet.  The \\"bedding\\" is witnessed by his best friend, her sister, and her brother.  That's right.  It's like a bad porn movie.  And it's not one of those historically accurate \\"witness the consummation\\" moments.  It feels really dirty.  Squick.    I have to give \\"The Fall\\" one star.  It just doesn't have any redeeming qualities--though the secondary romance comes close.  I'd love to play the part of fangirl (which I am when it comes to Dain, honestly), but I have to be honest.  The plot looks like someone used it for target practice.  The characters aren't very good.  The prose, from an author who's normally excellent, is awful.  And, there are some downright disgusting and horrific scenes.  I love Claudia Dain, she's so much better than this.  Go read \\"The Marriage Bed\\", or \\"Tell Me Lies\\", or \\"A Kiss To Die For\\", or heck ANYTHING else by Dain.  She's normally amazing, but we all have bad days, right?    Also, there are \\"Taming of The Shrew\\" elements here.  I guess.  Sort of.  But not enough to mention.  I don't really think that comparison was Dain's intention at all, nor do I really think it is founded.	2004-10-20

Raised on her father's Jamaican sugar plantation, Grace Welbourne has developed a sincere disgust for the way her father's slaves are treated.  She'd love to get away from plantation life, but can't leave the traditional way because she's decided (much to her father's chagrin) never to marry.      Giles Courtney, playing follow the leader (as he's always done), wants to get married because his business partner and former captain has found great happiness with a wife.  Now a captain in his own right, Giles (like any seventeenth century privateer turned decent citizen again) wants a nice traditional life with a wife and family.    Giles is instantly bowled over by the beautiful Grace when he makes a stop to pick up sugar from her father's plantation.  He scores points with her when he refuses to transport some slaves for her father, citing his general dislike of slavery.  Over the course of an afternoon, these two take a cautious shine to one another.  When Giles returns to the Welbourne Plantation a few months later at Grace's father's invitation, he and Grace frolic in their mutual hatred of slavery and bond over the death of a young slave girl.  After a few hours together, Giles asks permission to marry her; finally repulsed beyond her ability to bear by her father's treatment of his slaves, Grace agrees to marry Giles to get away.  Also, she is pretty sure he's a nice guy.    Grace is a difficult character to like.  Sure, some awful things have happened to her, and she has to deal with some things that would have been difficult to reconcile in her time period, but I'm just not sure I like her.  Rather than being somewhat grateful to Giles for marrying her in spite of her insane family, Grace is temperamental with him at the beginning of the marriage.  A little later, she completely loses it in an almost uncharacteristic moment of weakness when Giles tries to consummate the marriage, sure there are deep seeded reasons for this, but I just don't buy that she would utterly collapse, she seems so strong otherwise.    Giles is a good hero.  Reed does an excellent job of moving him from \\"first mate\\" follower in her previous book to \\"hero in his own right\\" here.  It's so cool to see him chasing after Grace when she's kidnapped, his ruthless side emerging as he goes along to the point where he coolly dispatches the villain without blinking an eye.  I was skeptical about Giles being the hero when I read the back of the book, but he turned out wonderfully.    I'm not thrilled with the fact that Giles and Grace are only given a few days as a married couple before she is kidnapped.  It's a little difficult for me to buy that these two could have come to deeply love each other in that time.  Not that their brief married days aren't wonderfully done, and so touching--I just wish we'd been able to see more of that.    The heavy emphasis on slavery was, at first, one dimensional victimization, but quickly moved into stories of African triumphs of spirit and intelligence that I truly appreciated.  One of Reed's greatest strengths is her ability to fully flesh  both her story and her characters.  I'm not thrilled with the long separation during Grace's kidnapping.  Nor am I thrilled with the fact that, on top of slavery, we have to take deep looks at prostitution, molestation, and incest.  It's all a bit depressing when things are all said and done, and the romance doesn't quite have the oomph to pull away from the relentless gloominess of the world our characters inhabit.    \\"For Her Love\\" is very readable, if nothing special.  Special kudos for the seventeenth century Caribbean setting (which has become all too rare in the historical romance market) and for a black/white interracial romance (as someone in such a relationship, I'm always happy to see someone breech this final racial taboo).  The romance is nice, but lacks steam.  The hero is excellent, but I find the heroine somewhat lacking.  Reed's strength is in writing a story that keepsyou turning the pages.  I give this book three stars; it is above average, but not on the level of her last work \\"Into His Arms\\".	2004-10-20

She's not terribly bothered by her fall from grace because she is sort of a country girl anyway, so she just lives quietly on her family's rural estate.  Things are fine until she goes to a ball and dresses like a whore.  She's only saved from complete disgrace because the Duke of Clayborough says he thinks she's original. <br /> <br />Hadrian Braxton-Lowell, Duke of Clayborough, is instantly enchanted with Lady Nicole.  Mistaking her for a married lady of experience, he makes romantic overtures toward her.  After a hot make-out session in the woods, Hadrian learns that Lady Nicole is in fact an innocent spinster.  Hadrian has been betrothed since childhood and is nearly ready to marry his fiance, so he breaks things off with Lady Nicole. <br /> <br />\\"Scandalous Love\\" is almost a good book.  I like the idea of the story.  Nicole is sort of an underdog heroine and I like that.  There are some really poignant moments where she is embarrassed and Hadrian helps her or makes her feel better about herself.  I like the idea of Hadrian too.  He's torn between his growing attraction for Nicole and his genuine affection for his lovely little fiance.  This story's problems, however, outshine its finer points. <br /> <br />Lady Nicole is spunky to the point of annoyance.  She constantly puts herself in embarrassing situations, then has to be \\"saved\\" by Hadrian.  We hear that she wasn't exactly a success as a debutante, but she is easily convinced that the eminently eligible Duke of Clayborough is interested in marrying her--making her seem a bit simple.  There's an eye-roll inducing misunderstanding at the end of the story that has her flouncing off in a huff and then demanding a divorce.  She's just too much. <br /> <br />Hadrian is a pretty good character.  I like that he's honorable and tries to do the right thing.  There are some nice moments when he comes to Nicole's rescue.  Really, my only problem with him is that he falls for Nicole to begin with.  Not that the reasons why he likes her aren't covered, they are, it's just that those reasons make me lose all respect for him.  It seems to me that he didn't know what a good thing he had with his fiance, and I really wish he'd spent a little more time mourning her loss. <br /> <br />In classic Brenda Joyce style, the story never drags but clips along at a brisk pace.  There's not much subtlety to the resolution of the situation with Hadrian's fiance--we all saw that coming--but I do appreciate that the fiance wasn't vilified, though she was a little too conveniently disposed of.  We're shown a passionate romance, but I'm not very enthusiastic about it. <br /> <br />With a lackluster heroine, a more likable \\"other woman\\", and a less than suspenseful plot \\"Scandalous Love\\" gets two stars--it's not awful, it has potential, but it just didn't do it for me.  Brenda Joyce has written some good books, but this isn't one of them. <br /> <br />And I can't end without doing this.  I have two quick nitpicks: <br /> <br />First up is title misuse.  The daughter of an earl, a marquess, or a duke who has been given the courtesy title of \\"Lady\\" like Lady Nicole would only ever be \\"Lady Nicole Shelton\\" or \\"Lady Nicole\\".  Never would she be referred to as \\"Lady Shelton\\".  Nor would Nicole's mother, or any nineteenth century British noblewoman, be called \\"the Countess Jane\\" or anything like that.  She would occasionally be referred to as the \\"Countess of Dragmore\\" but mostly as \\"Lady Dragmore\\", and only ever called \\"Lady Dragmore\\" to her face--not to be confused with some common usage in other European countries. <br /> <br />Second is the fact that Nicole's mother was an actress.  It's flaunted as a point of pride in the book, as if Nicole were living in contemporary Beverly Hills and not Victorian England.  While it was not unprecedented for a peer to marry an actress in Victorian times, the bride would have been shunnedby society.  It hurts the believability of Nicole's situation when she's ostracized for jilting a fianc, but her mother is in no way censured for having been an actress.  An actress would have been grist for the gossip mills of the Victorian nobility for at least a generation or two and she never would have been accepted anywhere, in fact her children would have been lucky to have entre into every echelon of polite society. <br />	2004-08-24

Gavin Montgomery is deeply in love with Alice, a young, impoverished lady from a neighboring estate.  Alice's father rejects Gavin as a suitor and then promises her to another man.  Devastated that his lover will be marrying someone else, Gavin succumbs to pressure from his family and decides to marry an heiress whose lands border his to the north.<br /><br />Forced by her brute of a father to accept a betrothal to Gavin, Judith Revedoune is distraught over her fate.  Her mother raised her to be a nun and she'd had no idea she would ever marry.  Things look up, though, when she meets Gavin at their wedding ceremony.  They seem to have instant chemistry and it seems that maybe marriage won't be so bad.  Until, that is, she overhears Gavin swearing his undying love to Alice in the Garden during their wedding feast.<br /><br />Jude Deveraux's books are really hit-and-miss for me.  I've liked some of them, and I've really hated others.

She's got the barebones of a heroine you'd enjoy, but she does some really dumb things and then rants about how she doesn't have to answer to anyone and then she readily participates in the \\"big misunderstanding\\" by acting like a spoiled child.  Sure she was independent, and all of those tough heroine things, but the way her independent spirit was written made her seem bratty and petulant.<br /><br />Gavin was an unintelligent jerk.  He was one of those wholly selfish beings who is incapable of seeing the world from anything but his own point of view.  At first when the author introduced this as a trait of one of the psychotic villains I thought she would use it to teach Gavin a lesson about himself, but self-awareness was a little too much to hope for, from the author and the hero.<br /><br />If life isn't going Gavin's way, he lashes out at anyone around him.

She saves him from the villain, but he'll believe everything the villain says about the naughty things she's done.  Don't be mislead, he's not an alpha hero, he's a megalomaniacal tyrant.

Karen Ranney is one of the most frustrating authors.  The MacRae series has held no appeal for me.  I bought two of the earlier highland lord books and couldn't finish either one.  Why I bought this one, I'm not sure.  I picked it up on impulse, remembering that while Karen Ranney has put out some lousy stories, she's also written some brilliant ones.  Any author who can make a leper into one of the greatest romance heroes of all time has to have a few more good books left in her.  So I bought, I read, and while I'm not thrilled, I see serious signs that Karen Ranney may be moving back into top form. <br /> <br />Young and madly in love, Jeanne du Marchand was a French noblewoman whose dreams were about to come true.  At sixteen, she found herself carrying her lover's child, expecting to marry him so they could begin their happily ever after.  Fate and her arrogant jerk of a father step in.  Her father tells her that her lover has abandoned her and sends her away to bear her child in disgrace.  After the child is born he has it taken away from her and sends her to a convent where she is to pay for her sins for the next nine years.  Jeanne hopes that her lover will come for her, hopes to be reunited with her child and endures physical and mental torture at the convent so that she can find them again someday. <br /> <br />At seventeen, Douglas MacRae's heart was shattered when he was abandoned by Jeanne.  A servant tells him Jeanne is with child and has fled from him, never wanting to see him again.  Leaving France for his native Scotland, Douglas is distraught, but resolves to return to France and at least find his child.  At Jeanne's family estate, he learns that she has borne their child and left it with an old peasant couple.  Douglas takes his malnourished, nearly dead infant daughter from the couple and returns with her to Scotland, hating Jeanne for abandoning the child.  He names the baby Margaret. <br /> <br />Our story really begins when Jeanne and Douglas meet again ten years later.  Jeanne has been forced to flee both the convent and France because of the Revolution, and decides to make her way to Scotland.  She's working as a governess for a business associate of Douglas's.  When her employer makes improper remarks about her to Douglas, Douglas seeks her out and offers her a job as his governess.  Jeanne takes Douglas up on his offer when her employer molests her and threatens to make her his mistress. <br /> <br />\\"So In Love\\" is, as you have probably guessed, a story with a HUGE misunderstanding.  Jeanne is mad at Douglas because he never came back for her and their child.  Douglas is mad at Jeanne because she left him and deserted their child, leaving the infant to die.  Do they ever have a conversation and figure all this out?  Yeah, about thirty pages away from the end of the book.  This story left me gritting my teeth in frustration over the unnecessary lack of communication. <br /> <br />Jeanne is, in almost every way, an excellent heroine.  She's had a rough time of it, but she's a survivor.  Despite the terrible things that have happened, she still has a soft heart underneath her armor and you find yourself really hoping she'll get a happy ending.  It's weird, but even her reluctance to explain to Douglas and clear up the big misunderstanding is so well done that I almost buy into it (almost), and oddly it never leads me to question her intelligence.  She's tough with the villain when he reappears, not giving an inch, and I just can't help but like her. <br /> <br />Douglas is a fairly likable hero too.  He's raised his daughter, and I'm as much a sucker for the \\"sexy hero raising a kid alone\\" thing as the next girl is.  It is even believable that he offers to hire Jeanne despite the fact that he hates her so much, because deep down he's a good guy and hates to see anyone in her tough position--and of course deep down he's still in love with her.  Douglas's character is a little less believable with the bigmisunderstanding thing.  He hasn't been stuck in a convent being tortured for the last nine years, and he should have the intelligence to realize that they were just teenagers and that whatever he might think she's guilty of, Jeanne has obviously changed--not that she's really guilty of anything, as he'd discover if they just had a conversation. <br /> <br />Karen Ranney specializes in angst.  When she's on her game, she's an absolute master at it, and she really makes an effort in \\"So In Love\\".  It's sad, but for what it's worth I want to say that \\"So In Love\\" is hands down the best \\"misunderstanding\\" story I've ever read.  It's readable, in spite of the frustrating elements.  In fact, for me, it was downright enjoyable.  The character development is thorough, the love story is poignant, and because they were so young when they were separated, you want to give the protagonists the benefit of the doubt. <br /> <br />I give this book three stars.  While this isn't a masterpiece, I'm glad I read it.  Karen Ranney seems to be done with the MacRae series and she also seems to be almost fully back on track.  I'd recommend this to any Ranney fan who can stomach the \\"misunderstanding\\" angle, because otherwise it's excellent.  If you're new to Karen Ranney, I'd say read it if this kind of story appeals to you.  If you're not sure about this story but you love your romance with serious angst, then do whatever it takes to find yourself a copy of Ms. Ranney's \\"My Beloved\\"--it's on my all-time top ten list.	2004-08-09

Taking advantage of a case of mistaken identity after Waterloo, he leaves behind his life of privilege as the heir to a dukedom to become stable master for a knighted ex-soldier and his family. <br /> <br />Rebecca Tremaine was caught kissing a fortune hunting young nobleman and her parents forced her to become engaged to him.  She doesn't want the marriage and pours her heart out to her friend Connor.  When Connor proposes to help her runaway, Rebecca is more than willing to accept his help. <br /> <br />\\"The Runaway Duke\\" is one of those stories I find myself liking in spite of...myself.  I'll try to explain.  I'm not usually a fan of cartoonish Regency era (this is a little later than that) too-cute, fairy tale-ish romance novels.  Of the hundreds that have been written, I've liked only three or four, but I think I'll be adding \\"The Runaway Duke\\" to that short list.  It's \\"one of those\\" books done in a way that kept me turning the pages, had me loving the characters, and allowed me to ignore the things I usually would have a problem with. <br /> <br />Connor serves Rebecca's family for five years before they run away together and their romance actually begins, but it's pretty obvious that he's been subconsciously jonesing for her for quite a while.  Why is that a problem?  Well, Rebecca is eighteen for only a couple of days before Connor helps himself to her maidenhead.  And he's twenty-nine at the time, if memory serves.  He's basically been panting teenaged Rebecca for a while and the minute she crosses the jailbait line he's on her like white on rice.  It's a little off-putting. <br /> <br />Rebecca is a little too lovable, a little too precious, a little too quirky--a little too everything not to be a little irritating.  I do like her, but I find myself wishing she had some believable faults or something to take the \\"irresistible\\" polish off her. <br /> <br />I liked the characters in spite of the problems I hadwith them.  With a little suspension of disbelief I can forgive Connor and pretend it's the eighties again when the bodice-rippers shoved sixteen year old virgins at thirty-five year old guys without blinking an eye.  Rebecca does have an engaging quality even with all of her blinding perfection, and I find myself pulling for her.  The story is a little outlandish, but then what historical romance isn't?  That's sort of the definition of the sub-genre.  I admire the fact that the villains are interesting, and that they're three dimensional; that alone covers a lot of the author's other sins.  All in all, I liked \\"The Runaway Duke\\" even if I didn't love it. <br /> <br />I give this book three stars.  I like the author; she's got a strong narrative, her characterization is good (and will probably only improve with time), she gives the story a slightly dark undertone that adds volumes to its appeal, and the well-developed romance keeps me turning the pages.  I'd recommend this to fans of upbeat Regency era historicals--it's better than what you've probably been reading lately.  For those looking for a heavier element in their historical romance, you might want to give this a try if the storyline appeals.  There are some good things here.  Can't wait to see what Julie Anne Long comes up with next.	2004-08-09

I've been anticipating this book since the minute I put down \\"The Dark Highlander\\".  Of all of the authors on my \\"automatic buy\\" list who've been putting out hardbacks lately, there was only one for whom I would actually spend the extra money.  I love Karen Marie Moning.  Her books just speak to me, and I'm so happy to say that \\"The Immortal Highlander\\" was worth every dime.    Adam Black, Tuatha D Danaan extraordinaire, has been punished for his act of kindness toward a human.  He's been sentenced by his occasional lover the Faery Queen to live a human life among mankind while under a spell that makes it impossible for other humans to see or touch or hear him.  He's about to go stir-crazy after living his invisible life for a few months when he comes across Gabby O'Callaghan who-amazingly-can see him.    Gabby is the last in a long line of women who can see faeries.  Knowing that her life is forfeit if one of the Fae ever discovers that she can see them, Gabby has tried to create a normal modern life for herself.  She's in law school, she's searching for the perfect job, she's tried to have boyfriends, in short she's done her best not to let her weird, supernatural ability keep her from being normal.  Though she's accustomed to running across ethereally beautiful Faeries but pretending all the while that she doesn't see them, she's so taken aback by the sight of Adam-whose beauty is stunning even by Fae standards-that she stares a moment too long, allowing him to realizes she can see him.    So begins Adam's forceful courtship and coercion of Gabby.  You'd have to have read everything by Moning to really understand the nature of Adam.  He's known as the \\"Dark Fairy\\" for a reason.  When compared to other Faeries he's a humanitarian, but he's still a ruthlessly selfish being.  While he needs Gabby's help to get him re-instated to his full Faery powers, he also want to get in her pants and while he won't force her, he'll manipulate her to get what he wants-even stooping to blackmail.  Everything about Adam is \\"alpha\\" to the extreme, and in another author's hands he'd have been an unforgivable jerk, but Moning takes Adam and puts him through the wringer to create her most magnetic hero to date-and with this author that's really saying something.    Gabby is not quite the miracle of a character Adam is.  While Adam is in many ways a stock Moning hero, for some reason I buy into his uniqueness more than I do Gabby's.  Not that her character type isn't good.  She's a typical Moning heroine, and I like Moning's heroines.  They're invariably smart, out-going, funny, lovable virgins, but I guess they're just too much alike and starting to wear a little thin for me.    I'm also not thrilled with this book's re-visitation of past Moning characters.  It's fine that they're there, but do we need the cute references to their stories?  Do we need yet another character's affirmation that past heroes and heroines were the smartest, prettiest, coolest, etc.?  Personal pet peeve.  (And if we had to revisit characters, why couldn't it have been Circenn and Lisa?  I'd have loved to have seen Adam interact with Circenn.  Really my only complaint about how Adam's character was handled in \\"The Immortal Highlander\\" is that I still don't feel like his relationship with Circenn has been resolved-the fact that he's Circenn's father has had such a big role in making Adam different from his fellow Fae, I was really hoping it would get some serious screen time in this book.)    All in all, though, this book is excellent.  I unreservedly give it four stars.  Karen Marie Moning's voice pulls you into her passionate world of Highland warriors, Druids, Faeries, time-travellers, and spunky twenty-first century heroines.  Her intricate, vibrant, finely-honed prose stands out like a Faberg among plastic Easter eggs.  She's the absolute best the romance world has to offer and consistently delivers some of the most delicious, irresistible heroes around.	2004-08-09

Meara O'Rourke is surprised when after only having met the woman once years ago, she's suddenly summoned to her birth mother's bedside.  Sheila Black tries to tell her long-lost daughter something important, but doesn't get it out before she passes away.  It turns out Sheila had recently married a man who died instantly in the car wreck that eventually claimed Sheila's life and that half of this man's estate now belongs to Meara as Sheila's only heir.<br />\\"Meant To Be\\" reads more like a chick lit with a beefed up suspense angle than it does a traditional romance.  Mostly because of Meara's first person narrative and the chick lit prerequisite \\"life changes\\" she's implemented just prior to the story beginning (complete with a new list of rules to live her life by).  From the beginning when the birth mother's final words of mystery trailed off with her dying breath I knew that I was in for a fairly unoriginal \\"girl discovers herself and love along the way\\" type story.  Not that those can't be good if done well, but that isn't the case here.<br />Meara just isn't a very likable heroine for me.  She's been unlucky in love, but instead of truly deciding that she's the problem (as a list of new rules would imply), all of her boyfriends are conveniently at fault for the problems in her past relationships.  Meara's birth mother Sheila was only married to her husband Mitchell for a few days before they both died and Mitchell didn't have time to amend his will to protect the interests of his two children.  His property, a large area of timbered Pennsylvania wilderness with an inn and an old house, had in fact belonged to his children's recently deceased mother.  Instead of instantly relinquishing legal rights to this property, as would have been the moral thing, Meara instead drags her feet.  Later, on an environmental crusade that serves only as a rant for the author, she decides she's keeping the half of Mitchell's property because she hears there's a new development coming in the area and decides she needs to \\"protect\\" it.<br />Meara's romantic interest in the story is Fletcher Black, Mitchell's son.  We never get inside Fletcher's head, with the novel being written in the first person, but he just seems like a stock contemporary hero who's been burned in love and therefore swears off all women FOREVER.  His cosmopolitan ex-love interest is conveniently evil and slutty while Meara, the wholesome pie-baking nature-lover, happily plays her antithesis.  He's a wood carver who loves the forest he grew up in and only wants to live in an isolated cabin there instead of in San Francisco where he's been living and working for several years.  Fletcher seems to be attracted to Meara because her interests match up so neatly with his own, but I just don't feel any real chemistry between them.  He has some pretty good reasons to be leery of her considering the way she mucks up the dispersal of his father's estate and I can't really see what she does to endear herself to him to begin with.<br />All in all, I just didn't enjoy this book at all.  The writing was fine, but the story and the characterization were poor.  The suspense isn't really that suspenseful, and to my mind isn't really resolved as we never know who Meara's birth father is.  The villain is conveniently one dimensionally evil without having any deep motivations.  I give \\"Meant To Be\\" one star.

Spinster Amanda Briars is a Dickensian era novelist living an independent life in London.  As a gift to herself for her thirtieth birthday, Amanda has engaged the services of a top madam to find her a man to initiate her in the ways of love.  Plain and nearly a wallflower, Amanda doesn't suffer from terrible insecurities, but she doesn't seem to think she could get a man without paying for him.<br />Jack Devlin is a hard-nosed publisher who started with nothing and in a few short years is leading all aspects of England's literary industries.  Having recently acquired one of Miss Briar's early manuscripts, Jack shows up on her doorstep thinking a meeting has been arranged by a friend to discuss the publication of her work.  He's a little surprised, but quickly adapts when he realizes that Amanda thinks he's a gigolo.<br />The premise might make you think that Amanda is one of those silly historical heroines who do stupid things just for the sake of an outlandish plot (and the first couple of scenes might not convince you otherwise), but as we dig into the story we find that she's actually a sharp, normal person.  Kleypas's characterization is, as usual, first rate and you find yourself sympathetic to Amanda who just wants to experience a little bit more of life now that her \\"advanced\\" age allows her to do so.  I'm an Amanda fan right up until about the last fifth of the book when her otherwise strong character begins to suffer for the sake of a conflict in the romance.  Suddenly, she's unassertive, dishonest, and willing to play a quiet martyr, and I find my warm feelings for her starting to cool.<br />From the moment of their first meeting, Jack is taken with Amanda.  He's read her work and respects her as a writer, but he's also compellingly attracted to both her body and her personality.  I've been in kind of a drought where it comes to finding heroes who would make your toes curl lately, and I'm really happy that I ran into Jack in \\"Suddenly You\\".  He's got a dark past, but he isn't overly weighed down by his baggage.  There is definitely a reluctance to commit on his part, but when he does-watch out.  And the love scenes?  Don't burn yourself, they're very hot.<br />I was really into this story until about three quarters of the way through.  The romance and characterization were so well done that things were wrapping up a little too soon I think, so the author had to introduce some conflict.  I can understand why it was done, but the story really seemed to suffer for it.  There's a reluctance on the part of both the protagonists to be honest that is completely out of character for both.  No one wants to say how they feel after they'd been so forthright throughout the story to that point.  It's like the romance just runs out of steam and there's a last ditch effort to revive it at the expense of the characters themselves.  Toward the last few pages, things started to turn around and the hero and heroine were back on track, but it was hard to recover from the let-down of their unnecessary angst.<br />In the end, I have to give this book three stars, although if there were a three and a half star rating, that would be more appropriate.  Lisa Kleypas is a first class romance author who consistently delivers stories worth reading and characters worth loving.  If you haven't read anything of hers, I'd suggest you browse through her offerings and just pick the storyline that appeals the most to you, because you'll probably love it.	2004-07-18

I'd never read Leslie LaFoy before this, and I have to say that I'm really impressed with what I saw.  I'm actively seeking out some of her older titles, and the excerpt for her next book also looks promising.<br />Alexandra \\"Alex\\" Radford is an Englishwoman who was born and raised in England.  In her mid-twenties, she finds herself on English soil in the position of tutor to the heir of the raja in whose court she was raised for most of her life.  Because the young heir is suddenly without bodyguards (one dead, one brain-damaged), Alexandra (who also doubles as a dealer in Indian silver and other goods) turns to a highly recommended private investigator to help her find replacements for the lost bodyguards.<br />John Aiden Terrell has been trying very hard to lose himself in a bottle over the last year.  Upset over the loss of his lady love, for which he blames himself, Aiden (as he's mostly called) isn't happy when his old friend Barrett Stanbridge pulls him out of the gutter and forces him to clean himself up to be of help with Stanbridge's private investigation firm.  Not sure what he thinks of Alex, Aiden is more than a little miffed when he's assigned to handle her bodyguard needs.<br />This story goes along much like you'd expect it to.  Aiden moves in with Alex and her young charge, and the sexual tension between them builds.  Neither is really looking for a happily ever after, and I revel in stories where the protagonists are totally unprepared for total commitment.  This is where I really appreciate the rich storytelling style of the author.  She takes a story that shouldn't really have many surprises and digs deep enough into it to make it seem new and engaging.<br />Alex is such a beautiful character.  She's English, but she's also very much Indian.  Her interesting combination of Western and Indian philosophies is so well done.  Beyond just being a slightly exotic heroine for an English historical romance, she's also an embraceable character.  She's flawed, but she doesn't have intelligence problems and she doesn't seem to have trouble making the best of bad situations.<br />I like Aiden, but not nearly as well as Alex; his hang-ups end up feeling a little false, given his otherwise astute nature.  Not saying that his character is a disaster, just that he isn't a stand-out hero--although the final scenes help to up his \\"yum\\" factor.<br />I enjoyed \\"The Perfect Temptation\\", and was somewhat perplexed when what I'd first loved about it started to become a problem.  The intensity of Ms. LaFoy's style starts to become a little heavy toward the middle of the book.  It's hard to explain how it happened, I just felt that things started to get thick and more difficult to wade through.  Toward the end I was happy with the way things were moving again, and it's hard to say why I was having trouble turning the pages toward the middle, because I don't feel like it was the story itself.  This might be one of those times when it's just a matter of something not working for me personally, because I can't really put my finger on what about the writing quit working.<br />All in all, I think \\"The Perfect Temptation\\" is worth a peek--especially if you haven't read Ms. LaFoy before, because she seems to be an under appreciated talent to me.  I give this book three stars: it seemed to drag in the middle for me and the hero wasn't all that great, but I really feel that the bulk of my problems may have been matters of taste rather than actual issues with quality.	2004-07-17

George Pembroke, Viscount Sedgewick, lost his beloved wife two years ago in childbirth.  Heartbroken, his only consolation is his daughter; he neglects the small son born at his wife's death.  After spending his mourning period drinking, gambling, and whoring George is finally ready to take up the responsibilities of fatherhood again.  <br />Sally Spenser is the spinster daughter of a deceased vicar.  Her brother's attempts to marry her off to a disgusting old man have led her to consider becoming a governess.  Plain, poor, and only faintly connected to a noble house, Sally has few other options and is staying with her oldest friend Glee while she tries to decide what to do with her life.  Glee is George's sister, so Sally has known (and been in love with) the handsome George most of her life.  After the death of George's wife (who Sally was secretly jealous of), Sally has made an effort to reach out to George's motherless children.<br />Because George's children love Sally, Glee suggests that he hire Sally as his governess.  Realizing that won't work because he's a single man and she's still a young woman, George instead proposes a marriage of convenience to Sally.  It's really an interesting arrangement, because while George likes Sally he can't imagine being attracted to her and the two of them also have a tendency to argue as Sally isn't afraid to criticize George for his behavior toward his children.  I admire the way the author sets up their marriage, it really feels like a marriage of convenience and not just a plot device.<br />George is a difficult hero to take.  While he is fairly real and flawed, the fact that he has held a grudge against his baby son is difficult to swallow.  Not that he's been overtly cruel, he's mostly just neglected him, but then again, that's a terrible thing to do.  My feelings for George are mixed.  I'm sympathetic about his wife's death and enjoy the way he falls for Sally, I just wish he had treated his son a little better.  Theneglect could have existed without being quite so extreme.<br />I like Sally.  She's tough emotionally, but still vulnerable.  I love her interaction with his kids.  There's never a time when she comes across as too \\"goody-goody\\" or \\"heart-of-gold\\", she's real, but she's nice, and I like that.  Again, I appreciate that she isn't magically made an heiress or discovers that she's a beauty in the right clothes or anything.  She simply is who she is and manages to get her guy anyway.<br />I liked \\"An Improper Proposal\\".  It's one of those stories that could turn into a self-pitying disaster--or turn out to be a case of ugly duckling turns beautiful swan, but it doesn't.  There's also the factor of the first wife; George really was deeply in love with his first wife, she isn't found out to be an evil slut post-mortem or anything, she was a nice woman he truly adored.  The author doesn't take any of the dangerous routes with this story, but instead creates a sweet and satisfying romance where the heroine really is plain and poor and has been truly overlooked, and where the hero honestly loved his first wife and thought he'd never love again.  I enjoy stories like these where the author doesn't cop out with melodrama or drastic make-overs.  There were many great things about it, but there were problems too.<br />I had trouble with the author's style of writing.  Her prose is simple, not necessarily a bad thing, but she seemed to have trouble portraying the grittier side of a tale like this.  The prose and the characterization were a bit shallow, which detracted from what this story could have been.  I've read some truly poorly written books, and I don't want to say that the author comes anywhere near being a bad writer.  I guess essentially my problem is that her style didn't quite match her story.  This is probably more an issue of taste.<br />The only other problem that sticks out in my mind was with her knowledge of English titles.  Despite some usage by modern royaltyand some variations found with medieval nobility, except in the case where a noble family's surname happens to be the same as their title, a peer and their family would not use their title in place of their surname.  If Sally is George's wife, she would be Sally Pembroke, Viscountess Sedgewick--formally addressed as Lady Sedgewick, her name is Sally Pembroke, not Sally Sedgewick.  Along the same lines, George Pembroke, Viscount Sedgewick is only addressed as Lord Sedgewick or George Pembroke--he is not called Lord George Pembroke or Lord George Sedgewick.  The use of the courtesy title of \\"Lord\\" before a first name is reserved for the younger sons of Marquesses and Dukes (occasionally for the eldest son if no other titles are possessed by the line, but that's rare).<br />In the end, I give \\"An Improper Proposal\\" three stars.  It is readable--in fact for me it was a page turner--with a great story told the right way.  Apart from the hard to like hero and some inaccuracies, my problems were mainly with the depth of the characterization and the writer's style being a bit lighter than the story she was trying to tell.  I think I'd recommend this book to fans of this type of story, or to anyone who's read as many lousy books lately as I have, because despite my somewhat lukewarm review, this book was a welcome and enjoyable read.  I will most likely read Ms. Bolen again.	2004-07-14

I bought this book mostly because of the quantity of good reviews I read here (you'd think I'd have learned by now) and elsewhere.  Let's just say I was greatly disappointed.<br />Eliza Merriweather is a Regency English artist whose only dream is to go to Italy and study with the masters there.  Hampered by the fact that she was born into a fairly good family and has two younger sisters along with two matchmaking great-aunts who are her guardians, Eliza is forced to endure one Season before she can run off to follow her dream.  Though they know of her plans, her aunts, armed with their father's military strategy guide, are convinced they can find husbands for both Eliza and her debutante sister Grace.<br />Magnus MacKinnon, the Earl of Somerton, younger son of a dissolute Scottish lord has just inherited the family title after the death of his equally dissolute elder brother.  Magnus, having been in the military prior to becoming the earl, is unprepared to deal with the enormous financial burdens he inherited and, having made what looks to be a very poor investment with his remaining funds, is faced with marrying money or losing everything.  He meets the decidedly penniless Eliza shortly after she's committed a huge faux pas during her presentation.<br />This book is yet another unoriginal attempt to cash in on the appeal of humorous Historical Regency romances.  From the first few pages with the dotty, matchmaking aunts and the too precocious heroine I could see disaster looming.  This could have been a great story, if told the right way.  There could have been believable problems with better portrayals of the protagonists.  &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; just doesn't doesn't deliver on its possibilities.<br />Eliza is an artist.  Or so it seems.  Sure, she says she's an artist, and we see her painting, but I never really believe it.  Judging by her attitude and outlook, painting seems more like a hobby to her.  I've known some artists in my time and know that they come in all shapes, sizes, creeds, and personalities, but there's one thing that tends to unify them, no matter their style or medium, and that is that their art is not just a 9 to 5 job, it's who they are and deeply affects nearly every aspect of their lives.  I don't see Eliza looking at the world from what are believably an artist's eyes; she seems just like every other ninny of a Regency debutante in the romance world.  Her conflict over her wish to study in Italy would have been brilliant if it would have been something I could buy into, but it wasn't.  On top of the fact that I'm not sold on her commitment to her art, she's also incredibly selfish.  Her sister Grace is made to seem like a self-centered brat toward the end, but I really think that depiction should belong to Eliza.  She does some things that truly could compromise both of her sister's future prospects and doesn't even have the intelligence to realize it--and when they're pointed out to her, she's slightly contrite, but then commits the same mistakes again.  I found her almost wholly unlikable when she could have been such a wonderful heroine and that's a shame.<br />Magnus barely exists for me.  He's Scottish, but other than his brogue-ridden speech and a couple of statements, I would never guess.  Apparently he was in the military too, but other than a few pat references, you would never know it.  I feel the same way about Magnus's military career that I do about Eliza's being an artist.  Also, Magnus makes some really dumb and selfish decisions.  He makes an investment that is, as other characters point out, a horrible decision.  He pursues Eliza, knowing he most likely cannot marry her, which seems really inconsiderate to me; at the least some cogency could have been added to a character who is mostly an enigma if he'd had to spend some real time pining after what he couldn't have instead of knowing he couldn't have it and trying to take it anyway.  This character just didn't work for me atall.<br />Filled with matchmaking schemes, &quot;cute&quot; elderly relatives, wallpaper motivations, unpleasant characters and too-trite-to-stomach moments &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; gets a two star rating from me.  Why do I even give it two stars?  Well, I will say that there are glimpses of promise in this book that elevate it above a total disaster; I really believe with better execution, it could have been excellent.  The prose is very good, and it is at times very readable, it's only when the author tries too hard to be funny or cute that it doesn't work for me.  I'd even say that I'd give this author another try if someone I trusted said her next work was worth the bother--I can see that there is some real potential here.  All in all, though, I'd not recommend this book to anyone.  You've seen it before, and you've seen it done better.	2004-07-12

Harriet Sainthill was apparently jilted by her fianc&eacute; (who was scandalous, I guess) in one of the author's previous books.  A spinster living with her Viscount brother and his family, Harriet wants a change in her life and decides to become a governess.  Yes, you heard me right.  A Viscount's daughter wants to become a governess; not because she's homeless or has no money or family, but just so she can be independent or something.  (Go ahead and chuck your disbelief out the window now, because things do not get better from here.)<br />Lord Nathaniel Bennett (the author insists he has a title of his own, but he wouldn't, so I won't use it) has recently lost his brother and sister-in-law to illness.  His four year old nephew (now a duke) and two young nieces have, through Nathaniel's neglect, fallen into the clutches of an unscrupulous great-uncle.  Facing a legal battle for custody that he fears he can't win and fearing for the life of his nephew, Lord Nathaniel decides to kidnap his nieces and nephew from his uncle.<br />Harriet is one of the worst romance heroines I've ever seen; she's just a stupid know-it-all.  We're introduced to her as she (having no parental experience herself) interferes with her brother's discipline of his son, then proceeds to lecture her brother on parenting.  I'm not even a parent and that bothers me.  And then, she has this idea about becoming a governess.  I'm not one to harp about historical accuracy, but come on.  A daughter of a viscount would never resort to taking employment unless she had no other option.  Not to mention that if she's as infamous as the book makes her seem, no one would hire her--Regency governesses had to have impeccable reputations.<br />Nathaniel is a blah hero.  I'm told he's a rake, but other than an \\"other woman\\" sex scene there's nothing to support it.  We know he's less than strong because he didn't take responsibility for his brother's children (as his brother asked on his deathbed), but things get worse when he decides that kidnapping them is the answer.  It's hard to say what the best solution to the problem is as we're never given enough information about the brother's will and laws of the time to make a determination, but it seems to me that kidnapping was one of the dumbest courses of action.  So, basically, Lord Nathaniel comes off as a weak, dim, poor excuse for a rake.<br />I've covered my problems with the characters, but those aren't even my biggest issues with the book.  I'll try to give you an example of what bothered me most:<br />I began reading and, for the first few pages, was intrigued with the style and initial set-up of the story.  Then things began to get tedious.  The story meanders through repetitive, non-essential detail.  After forty pages the protagonists hadn't yet met (a pet peeve of mine); my sister happened to call and we started a discussion of how much we hate it when it takes forever for the hero and heroine to meet.  Then I went back to reading and called my sister when I hit page fifty and they still hadn't met; we had a good laugh and I started reading again.  I hit page sixty and called her once more, because they still hadn't met!  She told me to quit reading.  I told her I wanted to review the book and therefore had to read more than sixty pages.  I kept reading, and when I hit page seventy (they still hadn't met!) I called her again.  Neither of us could remember reading a romance where it took this long for the romance to begin; she told me I was an idiot for continuing to read.  I kept going and was relieved when the hero and heroine finally found each other a page later, only to be flabbergasted YET AGAIN when, after the scene where they meet, I'm treated to a repetition of the scene on page eighty, only this time from another point of view.  The first hundred pages could be cut down to twenty without a single pertinent detail being removed.<br />Ok, did you notice my last paragraph--how long and filled with useless,meandering detail it was?  That's what the book is like: miles of unnecessary rambling.<br />\\"To Tempt a Rogue\\" has other problems too.  The romance is almost non-existent; Harriet and Nathaniel have no chemistry and seem to \\"fall in love\\" just because they're in the same place at the same time.  There is a \\"big misunderstanding\\" because the heroine, twit that she is, makes assumptions.  The heroine tips the evil uncle off to their hide-out --the twit factor again--but the hero takes responsibility for her stupidity (proving he's no genius himself).  Our hero's young charges don't act like any children I've ever met.  The dialogue is done about as poorly as any I've ever read.  The endless droning about carriage trips, Scottish scenery, nightgowns, baby dolls, etc.  drove me nuts--especially when many things like the legal situation with the hero's charges and the heroine's past (apparently you have to read a previous book to find out all the details about it) are woefully under explained.<br />I give \\"To Tempt a Rogue\\" one star.  The pacing is, frankly, boring; the characters are unlikable; the story, despite endless detail, in not cohesive.  And, I'm irked by the inattention to accuracy.  Avoid this book; it was my first of Ms. Basso's and will be my last (though I have the impression that she's capable of better than this).<br />Also, a bit of research into the use of Regency English titles (particularly, the non-disbursal of them to younger sons) would benefit the author.ring detail it was?

US	17963721	R3CMXOAUKCMZUL	0821777548	556267220	Somebody Wonderful (Zebra Debut)	Books	3	3	5	N	N	It really is Somebody Wonderful.	I'd like to begin by saying that this is one of those times that I find the five star rating system woefully inadequate.  Really this book deserves three and a half stars or even three and three quarters.  Ok, that's silly.  Let's just say I enjoyed it a little more than the &quot;average&quot; grade implies.<br />Timona Calverson is the daughter of a wealthy English peer who happens to be an obsessed dinosaur hunter.  Consequently, Timona has grown up bouncing around the world from dig to dig, getting into some infamous adventures and being one of those free spirited late Victorian era heroines everyone loves.  When she is kidnapped during a brief stay in New York, Timona manages to get away from her captors only to be attacked by a gang of youths shortly after her escape.  Dressed as a boy, Timona is taken in by the cop who rescues her from the gang.  Slightly stranded, and entirely besotted with her hero, Timona firmly entrenches herself in his rundown one room flat--and his life--in an attempt to win his love.<br />Michael &quot;Mick&quot; McCann is an Irish policeman in later nineteenth century New York City.  Toughened by his immigration to the U.S. and by the corruption inherent in the New York police force, Mick tries to make amends to his conscience by helping those he can.  When he first meets Timona he assumes she's a prostitute on the run from her pimp, but feels a deep attraction to her anyway.<br />I'm not sure if this is a debut for the author.  The amazon.com listing says it's a Zebra debut, but normally when a book is actually an author's fist book they make a point of mentioning it a dozen times in the acknowledgements.  Anyway, I can't tell.  If this really were the author's debut, I wouldn't be surprised, because there are a few plotting mistakes where she's trying to do too much in too little space and a few side stories that are dropped a little too abruptly--common debut errors.  Overall, though, I find &quot;Somebody Wonderful&quot; thoroughly enjoyable.<br />I'm not sure if it's intentional, but Timona (or Timmy as Mick calls her) comes off as a little bit dim.  She puts me in mind of Ben Stiller's character from Zoolander who is described as &quot;a sweet simpleton&quot;.  Don't get me wrong, Timona is very loveable, and she's not annoyingly stupid in an &quot;independent&quot; way, she just doesn't seem to be in step with the real world.  I think she's supposed to come off as someone different, without the baggage carried by 99% of the people in the world, but to me she just seems a little slow.  Not that this is a big detractor from the story, but it's a little difficult to reconcile.<br />Mick is priceless.  He's exactly the sort of big, tough Irish policeman you want in a novel like this.  I love the fact that his character is flawed.  He participates in the corruption of the police force, but on the other hand he's a relentless do-gooder.  It's such a wonderful contradiction, if he were one without the other his character just wouldn't work, but as both he's magnificent.  The development of his affection for Timona is so well done that it makes me sigh.  Mick alone will make this book worth your while.<br />As you can probably tell, I like this book very much even as I'm aware of its flaws.  How can I not like it when it's often laugh-out-loud funny and its characters are so loveable?  So what are the problems besides what I've already mentioned?  Well, it begins in a slightly sketchy way, and at first I was sure it was going to be awful.  Then there's Mick's other love interest who is dropped and scarcely thought of after about the first third of the book.  Adding to the problems is the introduction of a whole new (large) batch of secondary characters half way through when Timmy meets back up with her father (and believe me, there were already plenty of secondary characters at that point).  And, there's kind of a convoluted villain plot that feels only partially developed to me...Ah, but I don'tcare!  I love it anyway!<br />At the more than reasonable price of $3.99, I would recommend this book.  True I only give it three stars, but I have never given a book more than four, and I'd rate this just below four stars if there were a way to do it.  Totally entertaining and totally worth your while (and with a totally hot hero), &quot;Somebody Wonderful&quot; is exactly what it says it is.  (And can I just say that I love that Kensington is doing this $3.99 debut thing?  This is the second book I've bought just for that reason, and I've thoroughly enjoyed them both.)<br />Ok, I know you thought I was done, but I can't end without mentioning the cover.  It's really not bad, but couldn't they have done a better job of making the picture look less contemporary?  It could have been taken last week.	2004-06-30

In order to receive his full inheritance, thanks to a strange requirement of his uncle's will (think Richard Pryor in &quot;Brewster's Millions&quot;), Rein Montgomery, the new Duke of Wroxly, is forced to try to survive London's slums for one month's time; he must do this without a penny of his own money, any help from friends or family, and while making sure no one knows his true identity.  Fate seems to take a hand when he's injured (just as he arrives in the Rookery) by a young Covent market girl who feels guilty for injuring him and agrees to take him in--temporarily.<br />Anna Brooks has fallen on hard times.  Raised somewhat gently in the country, her circumstances were reduced considerably when her parents were lost at sea and she now supports herself and her senile grandfather by selling kitchen utensils in the marketplace.  Though she dreams of a happily ever after, she's wise enough to be proactive about improving her future.  Taking her grandfather's penchant for inventing to heart, and inspired by the loss of her parents in a storm she wishes they could have outrun, she has invented a new kind of sail which will greatly increase the speed of naval ships.  Having sunk everything she has into her invention, as a woman she has little hope of selling her idea and improving her living condition until the Royal Navy announces a contest with a reward for whomever can invent a better design for sails.  She's close to the contest deadline when Rein &quot;Hemplewilt&quot; stumbles into her life.<br />&quot;Scandal&quot; begins with over-the-top, too precious prose, but eventually evens into a fresh, not so saccharine tone.  The characters are vivid--something I've come to expect from Ms. Britton--jumping off the page to act out their lives for your enjoyment.  I feel like I'm watching a romantic comedy set in the Regency period rather than reading a traditional romance novel, and that's not a bad thing.<br />Anna is just the sort of heroine you love to root for,she's down on her luck but she's smart and practical and you can tell she's going to land on her feet.  Despite the fact that she's well aware that &quot;Mr. Hemplewilt&quot; is some sort of gentleman and probably far beyond her reach, she doesn't hesitate to dream that they can have a future together and I like that.  We don't see Anna having pity parties and despairing that she's not good enough, at the same time she's not presumptive or demanding of equal treatment in a ridiculously modern way.  I really admire how well her character is drawn, so likeable and so plucky, but so obviously a real product of her times, not a modern day heroine dropped into the nineteenth century like we see so often these days.  My only real problem with Anna is that as the story progresses I begin to get a feeling of déjà vu, her story and character being only slightly different from those of the heroine of Ms. Britton's last novel &quot;Tempted&quot;.<br />Rein is a so-so hero.  His character is entertaining, and his actions consistent, but I find myself wishing he'd come to the correct conclusion sooner about how to deal with his post-slum relationship with Anna, or else at least atone for not having done so.  It makes it hard to really like him as a hero.  He seems more like a slightly dense secondary character, which I realize he was once, than a true leading man.<br />In the end, &quot;Scandal&quot; is just a little too familiar for me to be thrilled with it.  I see Anna experiencing nearly identical feelings to those of Mary in &quot;Tempted&quot;, and instead of being moved I am bored.  The hero, while fun to read about, isn't someone I'm thrilled with as a lead character.  I give this book three stars.  It's very readable, and no doubt many will enjoy it, especially those who haven't read this author's &quot;Tempted&quot;, but it's nothing to write home about, and not nearly as good as its predecessor.<br />And why is it called &quot;Scandal&quot;?  I don't recall a scandal in the book.	2004-06-29

Gently born but impoverished, Julia of Childress has become one of the greatest cooks in medieval France.  Jealously guarded by the abbess of the convent in which she was raised, Julia longs for a husband and family of her own as many of the other girls at the convent have found.  Finally, along comes a count with enough clout to make the abbess relinquish Julia's considerable talents for the period of a year.  Though she's incensed at being bartered for like a piece of property, Julia is excited at the prospect of adventure outside the convent walls--she hopes that at her new home she might be able to snag a husband.<br />Griffin, the Comte de Grandaise, has an olfactory peculiarity.  He was born with a sense of smell so powerful it will put modern day readers under the impression that it is akin to a super-power.  Unable to stomach most food because of his condition, Griffin is enamored of Julia's cooking and determinedly wins her services for a year.  Not prepared to be presented with a noble born lady instead of a homely, lower class cook, Griffin finds himself drawn to Julia for more than just her culinary skills.<br />At first I was as enchanted with &quot;The Marriage Test&quot; as every character in it seemed to be with Julia's food.  I loved the large role the food itself played, it really added to the entertainment value of the story.  Later, some of the food description did get a little old, but overall I didn't feel it detracted in any way from the story.<br />Julia is a strong woman, but not headstrong.  She realizes she has to play by the rules of her time and does the best she can to arrange her life the way she wants it without the extreme hysterics we so often see from medieval heroines.  Later in the story, when Griffin is forced at sword point to marry Julia, her reaction is so real to the situation and afterward her reaction to Griffin's treatment is so genuine I'm moved to tears.<br />Griffin doesn't fare as well as Julia.  His character never quite gets the polish it needs.  It seems he has a decent backstory, but it's not explored satisfactorily.  In the end, he's a little bit of an enigma and a little bit of an idiot.  I can understand Julia's attraction to him, but I'm never quite as sure what his real feelings are.<br />The romance isn't bad, in fact it has moments of greatness, but they're not enough to make for a stellar read.  Toward the end, the love story is resolved a little too early so the author introduces a silly, totally undeveloped hang-up on Griffin's part that has me gritting my teeth as it's an obvious device to add a final bit of drama to the romance.  Not that the hang-up was the only problem because the story had really run out of steam before that.<br />All in all &quot;The Marriage Test&quot; is easy to read and at places truly entertaining and moving, but doesn't quite pull together into a really good book.  I give it three stars because two wouldn't do justice to the excellent heroine and the well researched and entertaining plot.  I've read a Betina Krahn book before, but I can't remember which one it was, which may not be a good sign.

Lord Lockwood has been exposed to gossip since he first married his wife, but the latest rumor circling in Regency London could ruin his political career--his sexual preference is being called into question.  Faced with disgrace at the least and prosecution or even death at the worst, Lockwood knows he must quickly find a way to counter the rumors.  His secretary, eager to avoid the scandal that names him as Lockwood's lover, presents a plan that Lockwood take a mistress and be very public about it.  Lockwood agrees to find a \\"mistress in name only\\".<br />Laura Lancaster is an actress not by choice but necessity.  An American stranded in London without anyone to rely on, she's taken up a profession which pays more than that of a common laborer and which she seems to have some talent for.  Though actresses are known as loose women Laura has guarded her virtue carefully, but after losing her steady job decides to take her best friend's advice and begin to search for a gentleman protector.<br />\\"Until You're Mine\\" starts with a great idea.  I don't think I've ever really read a story about one of the truly infamous actresses of Regency London--I loved Pamela Britton's \\"Tempted\\", but don't quite think Mary falls into that category.  In most romance novels the actress ends up being the slutty ex-mistress or something, so I was intrigued to read a story that made an actress the heroine.<br />I wasn't disappointed in Laura.  She seemed self-possessed and bright enough to take care of herself, even if it meant doing something unpleasant.  Her mother was a French courtesan who had tried to push her into the business, and Laura fled to London to escape an attempted rape by the man her mother intended to be her \\"protector\\".  But despite her disgust with the world's oldest profession, Laura is more than willing to consider it when she has to, which I admire in a way--I hate it when a heroine would rather die in a gutter than do what it takes to survive.  Later in the book, herintelligence falters a bit to accommodate the increasingly outlandish plot, but on the whole I still find her likeable.<br />Lockwood is an interesting hero.  The fact that he's married adds a deeper tone to the first half of the book; it almost made me wonder if there would be a traditional romance ending--well done on the author's part.  Overall, Lockwood comes across as a decent guy who's had to deal with a flauntingly unfaithful wife for several years and is frankly sick of the scandals she causes.  He's just a politician trying to do good, etc., who wants to avoid gossip by finding a woman to play his mistress.  I'm never quite sure why it is that he only wants to have a mistress \\"in name only\\" instead of the real thing.  It's never really clear if that's an emotional dilemma, or an ethical one, I wish it had been explored more.<br />The first half of \\"Until You're Mine\\" had me hooked, I loved the characters, loved the original feel of the story, but then things started to slide downhill.  The man Laura once fled from is reintroduced to the story to add some action I guess.  Lockwood's wife returns and is one dimensional right up until her next-to-last scene--too late to make her truly interesting.  A lot of \\"historical romance\\" type plot elements are introduced and I'm never really sure why.  It doesn't seem to be the way the book was going originally.  The author may have had pressure to add things or beef up the action, I'm not sure.  In the end I just wish it had finished the way it began.<br />I'm giving \\"Until You're Mine\\" three stars.  It's very readable, and I know there are readers who won't mind some of the changes in the second half that bothered me.  This was my first Lisa Higdon, but I intend to read her again because I really do like her style.	2004-06-28

I kept telling myself I was saving my one stars for books that were so bad I couldn't finish them.  Apparently I was wrong, because I did finish this one.  It was like a horrible accident on the freeway--I just couldn't look away.<br />Casey Turner is a cardboard cut-out tomboy heroine in late nineteenth century Texas.  Because she loves her daddy and their ranch so much she's willing to marry a guy she hates to save them.  Sure she walks around wearing pants and sort of acting like a cowboy, but of course underneath it all she's beautiful and fiery and loyal and all of those things a western heroine should be.<br />Michael Donovan's father owns the ranch next to the Turners, and his father and Casey's have been feuding since whenever and so Michael and Casey carried on the feud into the next generation.  Sent back east for college, Michael is called home right after graduation because his dad has been shot and is paralyzed and Michael has to take over the ranch.<br />There's this thing about both of their fathers being ill and dying and the bank foreclosing on the Turners that convinces the fathers to make their kids marry and merge their ranches.  It really doesn't make sense, especially not in a western setting.  The villains are really campy and I enjoy them more than anything else in the book, John and Karen are at least a little entertaining.<br />The problems with this book are plentiful, but the worst is the writing itself.  For the first few pages I was sure that I'd accidentally picked up one of those teenaged romances or something, because the writing seemed so simplistic.  Here's a line from the book:<br />==<br />\\"What do you need me to do?  Name it. I'm ready.\\"  Casey was ready to do whatever was necessary.<br />==<br />Um, redundant much?  The whole book is like that.  It reminds me of exercises you did in third grade, when they gave you three simple sentences that you had to combine to teach you how to make compoundsentences.  I can't believe it was published like this.  \\"Brazen\\" made me realize that Strunk & White should be elevated to the status of super heroes.<br />It's not just the simplicity of the writing that's a problem; the characters and plot are beginner-level too.  Don't get confused, Michael and Casey don't have an Anne and Gilbert thing going on--they really don't like each other, never have.  Then they fall in love.  Just because it's a romance novel I guess, because I don't see anything besides some kissing that makes them think they're in love and I'm not even sure why they want to kiss to begin with.<br />This lousy novella masquerading as a $6.99 full length historical is a bad read.  Save your money, run the other way.  I only give it one star only because they don't let you do zero.<br />Oh, and shouldn't a novel with a name like \\"Brazen\\" have hot love scenes?  I prefer tasteful love scenes, but these were positively antiseptic.	2004-06-22

Recently engaged, she convinces her lieutenant fiancé to let her help him catch the infamous pirate Black Jack Rhys.  Dressed as a serving girl in a pub where the pirate is being set up, Lorelei recognizes Rhys as the man she danced with at a society party the night before and immediately fingers him as the man they're after.<br />Jack Rhys had a rough life.  His mother was a prostitute (is that a pirating prerequisite?), but he's raised himself up from a cabin boy to be the captain of his own ship.  He kidnaps Lorelei in hopes of luring her fiancé and his father (Jack's nemesis) into a trap.<br />Lorelei isn't just feisty in the wallpaper sense, she really is, and I find it refreshing to see a heroine who is self-possessed and confident.  She does come across as a little dim sometimes, but on the whole she's likeable.<br />Jack is a little complicated because of his horrible childhood, but we never really get the satisfaction we need from the build-up of his story because the book ends on a total cop-out.<br />The romance is nice, and I find myself wishing I could see it in a different setting where it would come off as a little more believable.  Jack falls hard for Lorelei, and I'm a sucker for a strong guy who is flattened by gut-wrenching love for his gal.<br />One of my biggest problems with this book is Jack's pirate ship, which seems more like a fantasy rendition of a pirate ship than reality.  All of the pirates are nice.  Some of the men have wives on board.  It seems that everyone and their brother has a cabin on their own, and I'm beginning to wonder if this is supposed to be some late eighteenth century cruise ship or something.  Let's just say that if you're looking for gritty pirate fare this isn't the place to find it.<br />Overall, &quot;Master of Seduction&quot; is very readable, if a little forgettable.  The heroine is cool and the hero is pretty much ok.  It gets three stars because it balks at real emotional depth and because the story drags in places, then ends unsatisfactorily.<br />And the cover?  Yuck.  And wasn't the hero blonde?	2004-06-22

Her parents were cold scientists and so she got sort of cold or something and then rebelled or something and then I guess her parents died while she was working for an insurance company.  Anyway, let's just skip her unnecessary back story and say that she's 25 and in Scotland to lose her virginity when she falls down a hole/cave right onto McRip VanWinkle.<br />The last thing Drustan MacKeltar knew he was in sixteenth century Scotland mourning the death of his brother and the fiancé he'd never actually met.  Now, he wakes up with Gwen on top of him in the twentieth century.<br />\\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" is a lot of fun.  Not fun in a corny \\"rompy\\" sense, but just sort of escapist fun.<br />Apparently Drustan was put into a cursed sleep and was accidentally awakened by Gwen.  Our pair of lovebirds wander around Scotland for a few days in the twentieth century trying to come to terms with each other before Drustan sends them back in time with some mystical druid magic his clan was entrusted with.  Things go wrong, Gwen sort of ends up fending for herself in sixteenth century Scotland, Drustan can't remember her, etc.  I don't really know how to describe the story without spoiling some of the more major points so I guess I'll just avoid it.  There are some frustrating misunderstanding type situations and no one seems to act terribly intelligently, despite what we're constantly told about them.<br />Gwen is not the greatest heroine, in fact I find her pretty irritating a lot of the time.  Drustan fares a little better, but I'm never quite sure why he fell so quickly for Gwen.  I dunno, I guess for me there's more sexual chemistry than romantic chemistry between them.<br />\\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" is very readable, and great for a poolside read, but it's not exactly setting the world on fire.  On the other hand if you're a fan of Ms. Moning, or just a fan of a well written time-travel you'll probably enjoy this one.  Also check out Ms. Moning's \\"The Dark Highlander\\" or \\"To Tame a Highland Warrior\\".	2004-06-22

Four stars from me isn't what it is with many reviewers--with me four stars are about as good as it gets.  I'm almost ashamed I only paid $3.99 for it when I pay two or three times as much for books from authors who don't come close to Paula Reed's quality.<br />Faith Cooper is the sheltered Puritan daughter of a loving home.  When she unknowingly attracts the attention of the cold, hard-line, middle-aged minister in her Massachusetts town she finds herself in an unexpected quandary.  When the minister tells her parents that she must marry him, they look for a way out, but believing the man is God's vessel on earth they feel they would be fighting God's will to go against him.  Faith, ever obedient and seeking to be a good Christian woman, knows she cannot marry this man and so decides she must risk disownment and leave the family she loves.  Her plan is to seek refuge with an aunt in Jamaica who was disowned for marrying a Catholic.<br />Geoff Hampton is leading the life he always wanted.  A privateer and captain of his own ship, he seems merely amused when he finds the prim Puritan stowaway.  He doesn't expect to be irresistibly drawn to the woman, and he doesn't expect her to slowly make him change his perspective on life.<br />The plot of &quot;Into His Arms&quot; isn't original.  You're probably reading the description and thinking that you've seen this before.  Trust me, you haven't.  Paula Reed has given this story such depth that for the first few chapters I'm convinced it can't be a real romance novel.  These characters are so well fleshed out that every action and motivation seems real and sincere.  There's nothing brand new here, and to be honest there are many clichés, but here they're handled so gently by this master storyteller that I find myself deeply moved--this is proof that in the right hands, even the most tired plot becomes new again.<br />Faith's crisis and subsequent journey have not just caused an inconvenience, they've forced her to question her faith and take a hard look at the beliefs she's held dear all of her life.  There's character development and an internal journey here that you just don't see in romance novels.  Not that there isn't romance, because there is and it is so passionate but so sweet at the same time that I find myself completely swept away by it.<br />Geoff doesn't quite get the full character treatment that Faith does, but the book doesn't really suffer for it.  He grows as his love for Faith grows and he eventually experiences his own sort of epiphany.  The funny thing is that the plot would make you think that Geoff is the bloodthirsty, lusty pirate type, but he isn't.  In a way, he's really a beta type hero.  Not to say he isn't a thoroughly and deliciously confident male, but he isn't a jerk like you expect normal alpha heroes to be.  I love him, he's not just a romance novel hero, he's a real life hero you could live with.  I'd happily jump &quot;Into His Arms&quot;.<br />There are a few minor problems with this book.  I enjoy the way that the anti-villain, Diego, is portrayed and how he's fully fleshed out, but I think his character gets a little too much attention.  But maybe that's just because I'm so accustomed to normal romance formula, or maybe it's because I begrudge him every paragraph that could have been dedicated to the love story.  Regardless, I actually hope he gets his own book, and that might be the first time I've ever thought that about a secondary character.<br />Also, the story slows a bit toward the end; not terribly, and it's still very readable, but it ends more in the way you'd expect a real book to, rather than a romance novel.  Again, this problem may be more from me expecting formula and not exactly getting it.  My preference would be to tighten up the story just a bit, and maybe tighten up the romance a little.  But in the end I don't really care about anyof my minor issues with the book.<br />&quot;Into His Arms&quot; is beautiful.  I absolutely recommend it to anyone, and actually plan to hand it off to a couple of my friends who aren't romance fans.  It's that good.  And, it shows the potential this author has.  I am almost afraid to say that I'm expecting great things from her, because I've read good debuts before and thought authors would get better but then they didn't.  Then again, I've never read a debut this good, so I'm quietly crossing my fingers.  Buy this book, you won't regret it.	2004-06-17

Heartbroken after finding out about the wager, she and Lord Dare have been in a fierce battle (fought quietly in the ballrooms of London) for six years.  When Dare seems to be seriously courting another woman, Georgiana decides to intercede to &quot;teach him a lesson&quot; so that he doesn't hurt this woman as he hurt her.<br />Viscount Dare inherited a financial mess when his father died four years before, so for the sake of the aunts and brothers he loves he's decided to marry rich to repair the family fortunes.  He's just begun to court a rich young woman when Georgiana steals his attention, placing herself firmly back into his life by moving in with him under the guise of playing companion to his elderly aunts.  Dare never ruined Georgiana as he could have, keeping the stocking for himself and losing the wager.  (Something Georgiana seems to lack the intelligence to realize.)  He enjoyed seducing her, and even underneath their thinly veiled war of words (and sometimes fans) he still feels a small attraction and if she's willing, he'll pick things up where they left off six years ago.<br />With a bevy of secondary characters (useless except for the fact that they're obvious advertisements for future books), &quot;The Rake&quot; is mostly Georgiana's attempt to teach Dare a lesson.  The first 100 pages were difficult for me to get through, only my determination not to have wasted $6 kept me going.  After the first bit, the reading became easier, mainly because the comedy-type situations had thinned out and there was some real emotion coming through.  At the end, though, one scene with stupid actions on the part of both the hero and heroine left me cold.<br />I don't like the fact that Dare seduced Georgiana and never offered to marry her, as a man's honor at that time could be measured by that very action; it's also made clear that Dare would have no interest in Georgiana if she didn't have money, and that fact is played off as something we simply ought to be grateful for.  I'm thrown off later when Dare seems likeable in other ways after his behavior to both Georgiana and the other woman he's courting.  It just doesn't seem consistent with his character that he could have been so totally careless in his actions.  Toward the middle of the book, I don't really believe that he's capable of the behavior he's guilty of; I think bad characterization is to blame. <br />Georgiana is a moron.  There really isn't much more to say.  I think she was silly for being so easily seduced all of those years ago, and her ideas for revenge are totally irrational.  At the moment I'm at a loss to name one likeable thing about her.<br />&quot;The Rake&quot; is more a comedy of manners type Regency than a true historical romance (except maybe for the love scenes).  Between the lousy characterization and the slight change in the tone of the book, I find it hard to believe that the fans of either type of book would be truly happy with it as a whole.  &quot;The Rake&quot; gets two stars from me only because I could stand to finish it--my one star ratings are reserved for books I can't get through.	2004-06-16

I love Karen Marie Moning and read this book years ago, but loved the new cover so much I had to buy it (and read it) again.  Bless Dell for these hot but not disgusting covers.  Ever since \\"The Dark Highlander\\", Ms. Moning's books have had the best covers in the biz.  If a romance novel has to have a shirtless man on the cover, this is what it should look like!<br />Ok, enough drooling, on to the review...<br />Before I start, let me say that while a four star review may be the lowest rating some reviewers will give, with me it's actually about the best a book can be.  I'm saving my five stars for stuff that really knocks my socks off, and with Ms. Moning I'm pretty sure that there's a sock-knocker-offer in the offing and I want it to get the respect it deserves when it comes.<br />Gavrael McIllioch is a sixteenth century highlander who left his home at the age of fourteen after going into a Berserker rage and wiping out the invading army that nearly destroyed his people.  Believing that his father had murdered his mother in an inherited moment of insanity, Gavrael seems intent never to return.  Two years later he's found by the youngest daughter of another Scottish family and is taken in and essentially adopted by them.  We meet up with him several years after that when he's known as \\"Grimm\\" and has been living the life of a mercenary.<br />Grimm receives a message from the man who took him in at the age of sixteen.  It says simply, \\"Come for Jillian\\".  Dropping everything, Grimm races to answer the call.<br />Jillian St. Clair is a beautiful, wealthy young woman with everything going for her, except that she was once spurned by Grimm, the only man she's ever loved.  Now 21 and considered a spinster, Jillian has convinced everyone that she's saintly and not meant for marriage.  The illusions that she's built-up around herself begin to topple when her father brings Grimm back into her life in the hopes that he will marry her.  Around Grimm, Jillian becomes a feisty, quick-witted termagant.<br />The interaction between Grimm and Jillian is excellent.  Both are guarded for their own reasons: Grimm because he believes he's doomed by the fact that he's a Berserker to never be able to trust himself not to hurt a woman; Jillian because Grimm hurt her so badly when he left her before.  They argue and snap at one another, but the sexual tension bubbling under the surface is thrilling!<br />Jillian's father has brought two other suitors to vie with Grimm for Jillian's hand, but when Grimm won't even enter the competition things really heat up.  Sometimes Jillian's actions during this part of the story are a little exasperating, but she's cool enough to admit to herself that she's being annoying and it adds a depth to her character that lets you forgive some of the silly things she does.<br />Despite my overwhelmingly warm feelings for this book, it does have a few problems.  I don't want to spoil the story, but let's just say that there's a major misunderstanding regarding Grimm's past, and it bugs me that a little bit of information gathering on the parts of several people could have eliminated the problem altogether.  Also, the fact that Grimm so easily turned away from his father without being certain about what he thought is really out of character, I think.  It's like common sense is totally sacrificed for the sake of plot and I don't like that.<br />Also, we're led to believe that Jillian's father is one of the best, most respected men in Scotland, but he actually puts total faith in the main villain.  The actions of Jillian's father in general are irritating, which would be fine if it weren't obvious that he's meant to be a likeable character.<br />Really my problems with \\"To Tame a Highland Warrior\\" aren't that big, and I love it in spite of them.  This is a book not to be missed.  The chemistry between Jillian and Grimm is magnificent.  Theirs is a truly great love story.<br />I recommend anything else by Ms. Moning, especially \\"The Dark Highlander\\".  Come on, you know you want to add another one of these covers to your library!	2004-06-15

First she loses her beloved lifelong fiancé, then her father betroths her to a cold man twice her age.  It's not surprising that she's willing to take any chance that comes her way to avoid the match her father made, so she's decided to visit her cousin in the West Indies to avoid the marriage for a little longer.<br />Nicholas Sabine is an American shipping magnate who is caught behind enemy lines during the War of 1812.  Because he's defended his ships when the British attacked him, he is labeled a pirate and sentenced to hang.  He was behind enemy lines for a good reason, to bring his sister home with him, and despite being sentenced to death is most worried about finding a way to take care of her when he's killed.<br />With an idea you would only find in a romance novel (and probably already have), on the eve of his execution Nicholas asks Lady Aurora to be his wife.  He'll leave her a great deal of money if she'll find and take care of his little sister for him, and for Aurora it means she doesn't have to marry the man her father's chosen.  Oh, one last thing, she has to agree to consummate the marriage so no one can say it isn't legal.<br />So they marry, consummate, he lets her think he's dead.  She finds his sister, heads back to England, mourning the husband who made her &quot;feel things&quot; on her wedding night.  He escapes, heads to England to find her.  She's shocked that he's alive and doesn't know if she wants to be married to him now that he's back.  After a bunch of bedroom scenes her \\"dead\\" fiancé shows back up.  You can probably imagine how it goes from there.<br />In a historical sense, there's a lot wrong with &quot;The Passion&quot;; actually in any sense there's a lot wrong with it.  Aurora seems to care about what society thinks and yet she willing marries a condemned American pirate.  Her cousin offers her another way out of her unwanted marriage, but she doesn't take it and instead marriesa criminal.  Then, when said criminal shows back up, she's not sure she wants him for flimsy reasons about the fact that he's a rake and her not being sure of him, or what people would think.  Honestly, her reasons for not wanting to be with him are nonsensical and just an excuse to keep the story going an extra two hundred pages.  She's an English noblewoman, who is legally married in the early nineteenth century-she's not going to find some magic way out of it.<br />Before I let on that the book is totally past redemption, I do have to say that I like Nicholas.  Obviously, I think the heroine is totally unworthy of him.  I'm never really certain that either of them are in love, despite what they say, but he seems committed to giving her the benefit of the doubt and still wants her even after she rejects him about a hundred times.  There's something noble about most of his actions.  In fact, he's the only reason I kept reading the book after about page 100.  I skimmed every scene he wasn't in past that point.<br />I give \\"The Passion\\" two stars.  It's really not very readable, and the hero is the only thing saving it from being a total disaster.  Oh, and the love scenes?  I didn't see anything special.  There were a lot of them, to be sure, but nothing earth shattering.  If you want to see this story done right, I'd read Kathleen E. Woodiwiss's &quot;Shana&quot;.  This was my first Nicole Jordan and probably my last, so I have nothing else of hers to recommend in its place.	2004-06-15

She's a little taller than is fashionable, has a \\"lush\\" figure, she was born illegitimate and to top it all off she has a slightly checkered past.  Because she's been ruined, her half-brother's society friends seem to think she's fair game to be hit on (and pawed at), but like the self-possessed, confident woman she is, Kat has no problem fending off the unwanted advances.  And they are very unwanted, because when Kat was ruined she had her heartbroken by an unscrupulous rogue.<br />Devon St. John has ventured into Scotland to visit a friend--and also to outrun an enchanted family ring that \\"dooms\\" the holder to find their spouse.  He didn't outrun the ring, his recently married brother planted it on his person before he ran away.  When he discovers it, he decides the best way to avoid the \\"curse\\" of the ring is to distract himself with a decidedly ineligible woman--and his friend Malcolm's sister, Kat, seems to fit the bill perfectly.<br />\\"And the Bride Wore Plaid\\" is an upbeat style Regency historical, although it's a little less funny than it could have been and comes off mostly as light-hearted.  I like that Devon is instantly attracted to Kat for her slightly larger-than-life looks, and their chemistry is great.  The story drags a bit until Kat gets a little competition for Devon in the form of her brother's extremely beautiful sister-in-law.  There's also a nice subplot involving some marital strife between Malcolm and his wife.  Kat is a fairly likeable character.  Devon is likeable too, although he is a little elusive; I'm never sure that I really have a bead on him and his motivations.<br />I only have two major problems with this book.<br />First, there's an irksome attempt at a fairy tale angle (which is thankfully not terribly overused) with Kat having a \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarves\\" thing going on.  All of her giant \\"dwarves\\" are unnecessary and pointless; there are plenty of secondary characters without them.<br />My other problem is with Kat's \\"past\\".  I can't say \\"And the Bride Wore Plaid\\" is the first book that I've been bothered by something like this, but it's the first I've reviewed where it came up so I'm going to go into it.  I will say that the fact that Kat is not a virgin is integral to the plot; it's pretty safe to say that Devon wouldn't have been interested in her if she hadn't had a little experience.  Here's what bugs me: why do women who've had extra-marital sexual experiences always have to regret them in historical romances?  I'm at the point that I'd rather an author not write about experienced women if they're always going to have either had a bad sexual experience, or a good one that they enjoyed at the time but then greatly regretted.  If a heroine is going to defy the dictates of her society and willingly have sex before she's married, can't she do it for a good enough reason that it wasn't a mistake?  I'd like to think that most real women who had have affairs before marriage in those days did so because they truly wanted to and felt it was worth it.  Obviously there would be some who regretted it, but I tend to think there would be a higher percentage of women who didn't.  Okay, I'm done with that little rant.<br />In the end, this book is readable, but also nothing terribly exciting, so it gets three stars.  I've read the rest of the books in this series about the St. John ring, but can't really say there's one I'd recommend more than \\"And the Bride Wore Plaid\\".  If you liked any of the others in the series, or if you're already a Karen Hawkins fan, you'll probably like this book.<br />Sidenote: If you're a big Julia Quinn fan and you haven't read any Karen Hawkins yet, you should do so immediately.  I don't know anyone who loves one of those authors without loving the other.  Just so you know.	2004-06-11

Just a farm girl from Texas, the fact that her stepfather is the illegitimate son of a Duke has inspired Lydia to dream of her own glittering fairy tale in the world of the ton.<br />Rhys Rhodes, the Marquess of Blackhurst, hasn't had an easy life.  At all.  Ever.  After being abandoned by the brother he loved while in his teens (Lydia's stepfather), things went from bad to worse for Rhys who was basically disowned by his remaining family until the death of his older brother which left him the heir to the family's dukedom.  &quot;Forced&quot; to do some things he wasn't proud of to survive the years while he was outcast from his family, Rhys is convinced no woman could ever love him.  Then he meets his step-niece, Lydia, but can't possibly be with her (even though she definitely wants to be with him) because of some misguided notion about his past making him not good enough for a girl who wants a fairy tale.<br />The love story between Rhys and Lydia isn't bad, even if their nearly uncle/niece relationship is almost a turn-off.  Most of the time that their romance is developing I enjoy it, even if I'm occasionally irritated by Rhys's attraction to Lydia's &quot;innocence&quot;.  Toward the end of the story, however, Rhys is so thoroughly on the martyr train I lose patience quickly.  He makes some really dumb &quot;self-sacrificing&quot; decisions for unsupported reasons right after proving that he can act a little selfishly if he wants to.  Lydia isn't bad; she's not a standout heroine, but not a pushover either.  There's also an abundance of characters from past Heath novels in this book, so many that I almost feel like she's trying to see how many of them she can bring in without completely directing the story away from the leads--I've read the other books, but can't really say that I'm at all interested in how any of the characters are doing &quot;now&quot;.<br />This is the second Lorraine Heath book I've read in a couple of weeks, and even though I like &quot;Love With a Scandalous Lord&quot; better than the last book I read (&quot;An Invitation to Seduction&quot;), I'm still not thrilled with it.  I give it three stars because it falls a little more on the side of good than bad.  Having just finished it a few hours ago it's already fading into an undistinguishable lump in the pile of so-so romance novels in my memory.  In my last review I recommended Heath's &quot;The Outlaw and The Lady&quot; and &quot;To Marry an Heiress&quot; instead, and feel compelled to do the same again here.	2004-06-10
US	17963721	R128V8HA668NDB	0743456181	553104352	Almost Like Being in Love (Lost Texas Hearts, Book 2)	Books	3	8	11	N	N	Almost Like Suspending Disbelief...	Orphaned at age 8, Pepper Prescott had a troubled youth, bouncing around the system and acting out a bit before she eventually pulled her life together to become a successful landscaper in Washington, DC.  Her newly ordered life comes to a grinding halt when she witnesses a crime perpetrated by the military self-help author she idolizes.  The one bright spot in her checkered past was the high school year she spent on a ranch in Idaho with a foster mother who genuinely loved her, so when she is accused of committing the crime she witnessed, it's the first place she runs to.  <br />Enter Dan Graham, Pepper's first and only love, who was devastated when she ran away from home all those years ago.  The son of the owner of the neighboring ranch, Dan felt he needed to leave town after Pepper ran away so he joined the &quot;army&quot;.  Several years later he returns home, apparently retired from the &quot;special forces&quot;, after being seriously injured while fighting &quot;terrorists&quot;.  He's been looking after the ranch of Pepper's foster mother who has recently died.<br />We see a touching romance between Pepper and Dan.  Normally reunion stories leave me slightly irritated that the protagonists didn't just work out their issues at the time that they split, but things are handled so well here that I really believe these two needed the intervening years to bring them to this point where they could be together.  Dan has never gotten over Pepper, and almost from the moment he sees her again, he wants to be with her forever.  His attempts to lure her to his way of thinking are steamy and meaningful at the same time.  I adore this love story.<br />Things would probably be all right if that was all there was to &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;.  I like both Pepper and Dan.  The problem is that there's a convoluted plot about Dan actually still being active in the army and working with a superior to capture the terrorist he's after.  Also, throwing plausibility completely out the window, the crime Pepper witnessed in Washington, DC is in fact connected to the terrorists who are seeking Dan in Idaho.  It's just ridiculous.  It's distracting.  I'm almost angry about it.  This could have been a wonderful story.  The human side is so well done, the characters are so likeable and have such excellent chemistry--why this crazy plot that detracts from the emotional story?<br />There's so much inaccuracy here that I don't really know where to begin.  Though Dan is referred to as &quot;special forces&quot; in the &quot;army&quot;, the way his relationship to the terrorists is described would mean he actually would have been involved in the intelligence community.  In &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;, the &quot;army&quot; is actually running battle operations within the United States, which is silly, as everyone knows their jurisdiction is only OUTSIDE of our borders--we have internal law enforcement, both local and federal to handle domestic matters--never would anyone in the &quot;army&quot; be authorized to do something like this within the US, and I'm inclined to think that a situation like this if it were outside the US would actually be handled by the CIA not the army.  Dan is a lieutenant, but we're never told that he went to school to become an officer and I'm almost afraid the author doesn't know the difference between enlisted men and officers.  Another reviewer covered the inter-military inaccuracies, read that review for more information regarding those issues.  Also, there seems to be such an effort to remain politically correct and offend no racial, religious, or national group that we don't even know who these terrorists are or what they represent, which is irritating.  It's like having a villain in a story and not knowing anything about their motivations or ambitions, only that they're &quot;bad&quot;--it's almost cartoonish.  And last but not least, completely contrary to everything that we know about both characters, Dan and Pepper are deliberately drawing &quot;bad&quot; people to their idyllic little Idaho paradise with apparently no thought to the friends, neighbors, and family members who could be threatened by the presence of international terrorists bent on violence.  Dan's father actually lives next door to the ranch where Dan has set up his terrorist ambush, but Dan never considers what could happen if the terrorists (who surely are capable of it) hurt his father to get to him.<br />Really, I'm torn about giving this story three stars.  On one hand, the romance between these two great characters deserves to be recognized for how wonderful it is; on the other hand, the laughable terrorist plot deserves a zero.  I'm a big Christina Dodd fan, I enjoy her historicals very much and I liked the contemporary prequel to this book, &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;.  In the end, I'd say I liked this book more than I disliked it, but I have a hard time recommending it to anyone.  If you're a Dodd fan, I'd say check it out and like me you'll probably revel in the romance and try to overlook the other problems.  If you've never read Christina Dodd, though, I'd steer you toward &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot; if you want a contemporary or if you want historical romance try &quot;A Well Favored Gentleman&quot; or &quot;Rules of Surrender&quot;.	2004-06-09
US	17963721	R13HZX6BMICFK3	0060529466	846427863	An Invitation to Seduction	Books	2	24	25	N	N	American heiress in Victorian England--overbaked, familiar	Mary Ellen &quot;Kitty&quot; Robertson, the adopted daughter of an American tycoon, wants to be an elegant and respected lady like her adopted mother.  Well travelled and supposedly sophisticated, Kitty is engaged to a handsome, impoverished English lord.  Having selected her betrothed because he is charming, a good friend, and seems a &quot;safe&quot; (you won't be able to forget that term, believe me) choice for a husband, Kitty is surprised to find herself passionately drawn to the dark and serious Duke of Weddington. <br />The duke, a close friend of Kitty's fiancé, is instantly taken with the beautiful red headed American heiress after he encounters her near his home on the coast of Cornwall.  Knowing that Kitty's fiancé has a dark secret, Weddington is convinced that Kitty will never be happy with the man she has chosen and decides to pursue her himself.<br />At the beginning of &quot;An Invitation to Seduction&quot; I liked Weddington.  His character showed some hints of depth regarding a tragedy in his past and some lingering physical ailments, but any interesting character development is lost in the overwrought plot of this story--though I did like the fact that he had his own money and didn't need Kitty's, but liked her for herself.<br />I find Kitty to be a very grating character, with little to recommend her beside the facts that she is beautiful, rich, and American (in that order).  The primary issue driving her life choices is so silly and immature that even the author ends up brushing it off as an over-complicated hang-up toward the end.  I must say that she did seem to have grown up a bit by the end of the book, but it wasn't enough to make her sympathetic or likeable.<br />One of the redeeming points of this story is that Kitty's fiancé is a relatively three dimensional character and is not conveniently vilified as is so often done in the romance genre.  His secret, however, is painfully apparent from the beginning.<br />There are occasional hints at what the story could have been if it had been drawn out with a more subtle hand, but that's not enough to make &quot;An Invitation to Seduction&quot; a good read.  It does pick up a bit toward the middle, but by the last thirty pages it was so ridiculous that I put it down for a week, only bothering to finish it when I got sick of seeing the book on my night stand.<br />If this is your first Lorraine Heath book, I'd encourage you to try some of her others, like the very good &quot;The Outlaw and The Lady&quot; or even &quot;To Marry an Heiress&quot;.	2004-06-07
