This small volume (98 pages), is easy to read and understand; and is chock full of useful information. Author Simone Kelly answers questions you did not know you had, until you read a chapter and have that \\"Ah Ha\\" moment when everything comes together. If you are getting ready to build your business web site or are puzzled by the lack of hits and clients your present web site brings in, you must buy this book and read Chapter 12, \\"Wanna Know What Makes Them Click?\\". It is eye opening. \\"Jack of All Trades, Master of None?\\" is not simply a how-to book, it is workbook and a journal. Do yourself a favor and really think about the authors questions before responding to them; be honest, then write your answers in ink so you are not tempted to make changes later. Two of the questions threw me for a loop. \\"What do you love and really enjoy doing?\\" \\"Would you do this job for free?\\" On both, I answered too quickly and had to do a fast back stroke. I had not given these questions enough thought. Kelly advises her readers on page 9, \\"We have to take time to dig deep\\" for our answers.<br /><br />More advice from author Simone Kelly, \\"Stop Being a Jack!\\" Definitely recommended.<br /><br />Vannie(~.~)<br />[...]	2005-09-11

All are members of the Macko and Rubin \\"New Girls Club.\\" MIDLIFE CRISIS AT 30: HOW THE STAKES HAVE CHANGED FOR A NEW GENERATION--AND WHAT TO TO ABOUT IT  is the result of much research and countless interviews with women who changed their lives and are happy that they have done so.<br /><br />This book is a Godsend for 30 something business women who feel slightly out of sync or unhappy but not quite sure why. They will gain insight from the shared wisdom of the women who were interviewed. The women here were, and are, gutsy and courageous. Some walked away from weddings, others walked away from lucrative paying jobs to take chances and fulfill their dreams. Somewhere along the way, they realized that having it all is not necessarily the key to happiness or success.<br /><br />The first part of MIDLIFE CRISE AT 30 addresses trends, statistics and labels so I skimmed through that very quickly. However, as I continued reading these inspiring confessions and stories I found myself going back to read the first portion of the book to get the hard data on this complex issue.<br /><br />This is an important book. Authors Lia Macko and Kerry Rubin, both media  producers have done a great service for women in their thirty's who need guidance, advice and a little help from friends.<br /><br />Highly recommended for 30 something's and boomers like me who wonder if they made the right choice.<br /><br />Vannie(~.~)<br /><br />Work & Family @ BellaOnline.com<br /><br />[...]	2005-05-15

Two good friends collaborated and wrote THE FAMILY CFO. One is a certified financial planner and a principal in a large financial planning firm, the other is a journalist whose articles have appeared in Forbes magazine, Wall Street Journal and other publications.<br /><br />One of the first things THE FAMILY CFO authors do is to help couples get past the idea of not talking and sharing personal information about money. Allvine and Larson show couples that co-mingling, managing and talking about their money together is indeed necessary. They talked to real couples about their very real financial problems. As it says in the introduction -<br /><br />After reading this book, you and your partner will know how to:<br /><br />**Make effective financial decisions together without tension or arguments.<br /><br />**Reduce the time it takes to run your finances.<br /><br />**Use money as a tool to help you define your long-term vision and set goals, bringing you closer as partners and moving your relationship forward.<br /><br />The charts, worksheets, resources and retirement information in THE FAMILY CFO is invaluable. If you know a couple getting married be sure to give them a copy of this book along with that bottle of good wine.<br /><br />I grew up in a home where my mother never knew how much money my father made. She received a weekly allowance to run the house. When I was married the whole of it was about finance. We never had enough money and we were bogged down in debt. We pulled in opposite directions and never resolved anything. I wish THE FAMILY CFO: THE COUPLE'S BUSINESS PLAN FOR LOVE AND MONEY had been available then.<br /><br />There is much information for singles also. There are great finance resources and web sites.

He becomes that involved. You can almost hear him explaining that each of the five senses he brings into play are necessary to make your party work. He talks about the look, the scent, the touch, the taste and the music. Each component is important and relative to the other. For instance for a dinner party he calls Ya-Ya Sisterhood, a beautiful outdoor garden party is planned with pale colors, lots of flowers and delicate china. I admit that this touches my southern girl heart. Among the music he suggests is Bette Midler's \\"Miss Otis Regrets\\". Tutera's attention to small details can make any party special; he bought wind chimes for the garden.<br /><br />Several of the party ideas are a bit lavish for modest pockets but most of his ideas can be reasonably adapted. You will find that you don't always find a 'how-to' after an idea or tip has been given. However, that's not a real problem because the photographs by Charles and Jennifer Maring, are not only beautiful they also give you guidance.<br /><br />David Tutera appears on ABC's The View as contributing entertaining expert. His clients include Star Jones and Elton John. However, if you have a question concerning your next party you can talk to Tutera online in the The Party Planner forum on the Discovery Channel.<br /><br />Vannie(~.~)<br /><br />Work & Family @ BellaOnline.com<br /><br />[...]	2005-05-11

It offers excellent advice to new retirees or those thinking of retiring. Ellen Freudenheim has written a book that goes far beyond the standard ABC's of retirement. The author assumes that you want a 'real' life after you leave your primary job. Each section of the book offers good advice to those who want more. I loved the \\"Anchor Activities\\" section Growing, Doing and Just Being. Readers are encouraged to continue growing spiritually, to do what they have wanted to do, and to continue being who they are, but much more so. Sound advice is given concerning the retirees awareness of his or her new financial situation; and how to move on mentally and physically.<br /><br />As one who has recently retired, I read this book from beginning to end and found information that I have already begun to use. Freudenheim provides little windows into the lives of some people who have retired and are happy with their decision to do so. Some of those profiled continued doing more of what they enjoy, some made changes so drastic it boggles the mind. Might I suggest that this book is not just for those thinking of retirement? It will be useful to those who wonder with a fair amount of trepidation what they would do if they did retire.<br /><br />This book has the right title, Looking Forward: An Optimist's Guide to Retirement.

Books	4	49	51	N	N	An Early Start to Understanding Finance	This book is an excellent introduction to the how and why of finance. Author Robert T. Kiyosaki has written this short book in clear concise language that cannot be misunderstood by the teen in your family. At the outset, Kiyosaki puts the young reader at ease by talking about the myth of IQ and intelligence. He immediately erases any thoughts of \\"I am not smart enough to understand this book\\". Once again, as in his previous books, Kiyosaki emphasizes how the rich think differently from those who are in the middle and poor class. Rich Dad Poor Dad For Teens is an easy to read 'think positive about finances' book for young people. Included is a two-page glossary that proved to be very helpful to the young teen (age 15) who read this book after I did.<br /><br />In this day and age of consumer greed and high end designer clothing for teens, there is a chapter that addresses Stretching the Dollar. Kiyosaki does not say be frugal, instead he advices the teen to think of ways to recycle old clothing, how to buy in bulk, etc. I was particularly impressed with a revealing exercise under the heading of  The People Whom You Spend Your Time with Are Your Future . Now that can be scary--but what a powerful statement. I had earlier talks with my young friend concerning this very subject. Reading and discussing  Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens together gave us the opportunity to delve into this troubling issue again, this time with very positive results. He walked away feeling good about himself.<br /><br />I recommend Rich Dad Poor Dad for Teens: The Secrets About Money--That You Don't Learn in School!  This book can definitely help teens to accept and understand financial responsibility.<br /><br />Vannie(~.~)<br /><br />Work & Family @ BellaOnline.com<br /><br />[...]	2005-04-27

I did not know what to expect when I started reading \\"Dumb As Me.\\" What I found was a hard-hitting novel about a bragging womanizer named Justin who wasn't quite as smart as he thought he was. The<br />language in \\"Dumb As Me\\" is strong but is necessary to tell the story and to allow readers' to get into the protagonist's head. Justin Drake's single mission in life is to have sex with as many women as possible, as often as possible. He has so many women and aliases' it's hard to keep up with them. He justifies his actions by saying that \\"no matter how much I give out in the<br />streets, I still brought. . .home.\\" Justin's life takes a turn when he meets Eden, 'the only woman who can hold a candle to his [long suffering] wife.' Still, he cheats on both of them without any thought to consequences which may follow. He has no reason to, his wife had left him before, but returned. However, Jason's world is not what it seems and this player's life is not without pain. The ending of \\"Dumb As Me\\" is shocking and moving. It's a harsh ending to a harsh lifestyle. Michael Gainer's writing style has edge and grit that kept me turning pages to find out when and if Justin Drake would pay dues for being THE MAN. You don't have to sanction a player's lifestyle to find it fascinating.Vannie(~.~)	2003-02-24

Miller has written a good old fashioned fast paced mystery that is begging to be a movie. When janitor Ed Dixon is accused of murder he calls his financial advisor Audrey Wilson. He calls her because he has no friends and no family to speak of, except his estranged wife and she hasn't answered one of his letters in all the years he had written to her. When one of the young female teachers is killed in an upscale teaching academy Ed Dixon is caught literally with his pants down. Popular teacher Jackie Daniels is dead and all eyes are on Ed as the number one suspect. Everyone seems to have only kind words for Jackie, 'she was a fine young teacher. . .responsive to her students . . . admired by her peers.' No one has kind words for the janitor though. Students made a play on his last name after they found out that Ed had been reprimanded for sexually harassing the young teacher. The head master calls Ed a society cast-off. Jackie's father A.J. Daniel is determined that Ed Dixon goes to jail and will do anything in his power as her dad and as the city's wealthy, influential district attorney to see that this happens. But was Jackie Daniels the paragon of virtue she appeared to be? Why was she so brutally murdered? With the help of her new attorney friend Audrey is able to secure legal counsel for Ed, so they can find out the truth and to make sure that Ed gets his day in court. To her surprise Audrey finds herself attracted to this new friend. Now she has two mysteries on her hands, who really killed Jackie Daniels and why she is so drawn to a man who is not her type nor her color. Taxes, Death & Trouble is a tightly woven murder mystery of the first degree. I recommend this novel and anxiously await the further adventures of Audrey Wilson who is not shown here as the solver of the crime but is central to the story. The next in the series is titled 'Accrual Way to Die.' The witty play on words bespeaks Ms. Millers accounting background. Vannie(~.~)	2002-10-07

I cannot believe how much information there is in this small book for writer's and reader's as well. Mr. Fleming shares his vast knowledge with the reader. His excellent Writer's Resource section alone is worth more than the cost of the book. Mr. Fleming has removed weeks maybe months of research legwork and has put everything one needs to know to get started in the world of writing in less than 400 pages.This book is a very necessary tool for all would be authors. It also gave me a diffferent view of and a brand new respect for my favorite authors for their hard work and dedication to their craft.Why would anyone not interested in writing buy this book? Because it gives you insight into the whole genre of writing. Because you get a chance to read interviews with editors and author profiles. You also get URL's to websites, a list of AA booksellers with addressses, telephone and fax numbers and much more.I so recommend this book.Vannie	2000-11-04

I first discovered Sandra Kitt when I read &quot;The Color of Love&quot; and was absolutely blown away by it. With &quot;Close Encounters&quot; Ms. Kitt continues to see and write about the world as it really is. She understands that while the world is Black and White there is no color boundary when it comes to love. As usual her characters are real. They could be the people next door.The herione Carol Taggert gets caught in police crossfire in more ways than one.  As a Black women in NYC gunned downed by a stray police bullet, her first thoughts would be to sue the City wouldn't it?  Carol's family background and the lessons taught to her by her father and mother keeps her from doing that, but it doesn't stop her from having misgivings about how she feels about the White police officer who may have been the person who shot her. For me, &quot;Close Encounters&quot; was more than a interracial love story, and I don't think that it was meant to be just that. This book is about understanding who you are, how you feel about yourself and how you fit into the scheme of someone else's life and how they fit, whether you like it or not, into yours. And how 10 seconds can change your life forever. After the shooting, Carol starts to think about her past, how she treated her loving adoptive parents and about the husband she had chosen for all the wrong reasons. Police Officer Grafton realizes that outside of his fellow police officers, the only other people he has any real contact with are women that he sees for one reason only and the &quot;scum&quot; of the City. His total tunnel vision focus on &quot;policing&quot; had a negative effect on his broken marriage and is now having the same effect on his daughter. Both characters go through a lot pain and suffering as they reasses their lives and try to fight what they both know is a losing battle. They are bound together by more than the accidental shooting. He realizes it first and together they fight the odds against them. This is the kind of novel that I will read again and again.This is a wonderful book.is is the kind of novel that I will read again and again.This is a wonderful book.	2000-10-22
