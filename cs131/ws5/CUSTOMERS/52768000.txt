It was a lot of fun. <br /> <br />What truley set it apart for me is that Bruce Campbell was very self-depricating.  He was the butt of many of the jokes, but you still rooted for him. <br /> <br />This was a great/fun read that you will eat up while lounging on the beach or beside the pool this summer.	2005-06-13

To me it was a book about race relations told through the eyes of a racist.  While you don't always agree with Soledad, you can understand where she is coming from.  <br />The action scenes were quick and at times brutal; definately not the spectacular kind of action found in comic books like the Justice Leage or Avengers.  I guess what I'm saying is that it was as realistic as you can get in this kind of fiction.<br />The prose was James Ellroy like.  Terse and quick.  Don't use 7 words when 4 will do.  It seemed to me like the prose was ment to reflect Soledad.  She is not the type to be flowery and neither is the writing.  <br />Give this book a shot (pun definately intended).	2004-01-14

You could read it from cover to cover and take everything literally, and enjoy a good serial killer story.  Or you could stretch your brain muscles and read between the lines.<br />Much like the characters in the book I believe you, the reader, should not believe everything you see, or read.  A hint that Tim Underhill might not be a reliable narrator comes at the very beginning of the book.  Tim believes he is a witness to a hit and run accident that leaves a man dead.  However it turns out that it was just a movie being filmed and the man hit by the car is fine.  <br />This just sets up that nothing in this book (even the book itself, in my opinion) is as it appears.<br />When you're done with the book ask yourself, did I really read what I thought I did, or is there more in the background?  <br />I would love to go deep into examples of why I feel that Tim is an untrustworthy narrator, but I don't want to ruin anything for people who want to read this.  <br />Like I said you can read this as a straight forward mystery, or you can question the narrator and see where the answers to those questions take you.<br />As the X-Files said: Trust No One	2003-12-30

I had this one read in about the time it would take to watch the movie.  <br />Being a fan of Romero's classic Living Dead trilogy, I was very excited to hear about this great new zombie movie from the director of Trainspotting.  The screenplay moves very quickly.  Our heros are at constant odds with the environment, the Infected, and each other.  Pretty big homages are paid to Romero.  The scene in the abandoned grocery store (the mall in Dawn of the Dead), and the climax in the house (the house in Night of the Living Dead) come to mind immediatley.  There are others like the chained Infected (the chained zombie in Day of the Dead).  <br />This is a great screenplay, and I can't wait until this movie gets a theatrical release in America (August 2003).	2003-04-09

It combines some of Buffy's best television writers with some of my favorite comicbook artists.  <br />Most of the stories work very well.  My favorites being the first two stories by Joss Whedon with art by Lienl Yu and Tim Sale, and the western (the creative team escapes me).  The very first story illustrated by Yu is very short, but very sweet.  It sets up the history of the Slayer and primes you for the rest of the stories in the book.  Not to mention Yu is one of the best artists working in comics.  <br />The second story illustrated by Tim Sale is a masterpiece of short story.  It had a heart that I felt the rest of the stories lacked.  This story was told through the eyes of the Slayer's Watcher.  It tells the tale of how he trained his Slayer to protect the people from the supernatural menace of the vampires, but perhaps he has done his job a little too well.<br />The western story I like mainly because I have a soft spot in my heart for westerns.  This story has an ending that fans of Buffy season 3 will appreciate.<br />The rest of the stories while good just didn't have the punch that these three stories had.  Some of the stories didn't use their page count very well.  Amber Benson's story seemed to have high aspirations, but was far too short to have any real impact.  The story illustrated by P. Craig Russell seemed to have a bit of a cheat in the way one of the faces was drawn before and after the big reveal.	2003-01-31

Don't get me wrong there are big differences between the families, but this is another coming of age story by Champion Joe that involves gruesome murders.  <br />I guess you could call this a sequel in tone to the Bottoms.  Once again our hero is a young lad spending his time investigating a couple of grisly murders.  What sets this book apart from the Bottoms is that this family is a little more affluent, and live in a nicer town.  Also aside from the basic premise of a young man solving murders the stories and characters are completely different.<br />I enjoyed the fact that the father in A Fine Dark Line is not a perfect man.  He has a temper that can go off at any second.  He has no qualms about &quot;slapping a teenager smart,&quot; or beating on a man who abuses both Stanley's and his own family.  <br />I liked that we actually witnessed the hero, Stanley Jr., getting smarter as the book progressed.  I felt the writing style got a little better as the book went on, and since it was written in the first person from Stanley Jr.'s point-of-view, I thought the writing style reflected the protagonist getting smarter.<br />My one complaint is that this book lacked much of that famous Lansdale dialog.  You know the kind.  The dialog scenes that would have you belly laughing.  Those kinds of dialog.  <br />To be kind, there is a great dialog near the end of the book between Stanley Jr. and one of his family's tormentors.  I won't say any more.<br />&quot;The worm has spoken.&quot;	2003-01-29

Very different from the other Clancy books that I have read, but very good none the less. While Clancy's books deal with espionage, and war, this book takes those aspects and put them in the background. Shoved to the foreground is a revenge story. This is a great book with characters that you care about, and some very exciting action sequences. This book is highly recommended.	2002-12-02

The other two are Fight Club and Survivor.  Those two novels I loved.  The prose was short sweet and to the point.  The stories moved along quickly and were darkly comic.  <br />Lullaby had all of this as well, but for some reason this novel just didn't click for me.  Maybe it is the fact that the other novels that I have read by Chuck were very distinctly saterical, and I could not find the satire in this novel?  Was Chuck saterising the american family?  Modern society's need to impose itself on nature?  <br />This novel moves along at a very quick pace, and the ending is pretty good.  However I would recommend his other works before you read this one.  My personal favorite: Survivor.	2002-10-09

I know some of you are probably asking why I chose this one to start with.  Well the answer is simple.  I didn't want to read a Jack Ryan book, and this one deals with John Clark.  I'm sure I would have had a deeper understanding of some of the other characters who are in the book if I read some of Clancy's other books first, but I really enjoyed this novel.  <br />I put off reading Tom Clancy because I'm not usually a fan of the most popular authors (King, Grisham, Patterson, ect.).  However after some prodding I broke down and read Rainbow Six.  It was great.  I am a big fan of action movies, and that is exactly how this book read.  There are 5 big action sequences, with minor action scenes, like training, thrown in for good measure.  And when bullets and testosterone are not flying, there are some pretty good character moments.  Having never read a Clancy novel before I now feel that I know John Clark and Domingo &quot;Ding&quot; Chavez pretty well.  <br />Some people argue that the book doesn't really get going until the end, but I beg to differ.  I like the lead up the climax.  I liked the espionage that was going on.  <br />All in all I would highly recommend this book.  It is well worth the time put into it.  Plus it has an ending that I just was not expecting, and that is always a plus.	2002-09-30

The characters are interesting if not fleshed out.  If Monty was supposed to be the main character why did we spend so much time with Frank and Jakob?  I was more interested in what was going to happen to Jakob and Frank than I was in what was going to happen to Monty.  I hope that someday there will be a sequal to this set seven years minus 84 days for good behavior.  I would love to see where the characters are after Monty gets out of prison.  See if Frank keeps his promise about being there when Monty comes out.  See if Jakob is still teaching after what happens between him and Mary.  See if Naturelle actually does marry into money as Frank predicts.  See if Monty's dad keeps his bar.  This book had a lot of potential, and I would be very curious to see where these characters end up next.	2002-08-19

I have no major complaints about the book, but for some reason it didn't really do anything for me.  For me the book seemed to have too many characters for such a small book (in paperback it was only about 340 pages).  The short chapters made it a quick read, but there were at least 8 characters that you had to keep track of, and those were only the cops.  Let's not forget the suspects, both red herring and real.  With the suspects and victims added there are at least 12-15 names you have to keep track of.  To me that is just too many for such a short novel.  <br />Don't get me wrong I liked the book.  I thought the dialog was great, and last few chapters were really good.  At first I thought the ending came out of nowhere, but when I went back the clues were there (albeit small, and Mr. Harstad doesn't give the complete wrap up until the epiloge), but they were there.  <br />All in all I was entertained, and thought this was a great summer read.  I'd gladdly go back to the world of Carl Houseman.	2002-08-07

Mr. Gaiman has some brilliant ideas in his head, and luckly for us he also knows how to put them on paper.  After reading Neverwhere and Good Omens, I had high hopes for this book.  Well, the expectations were met and far exceeded.  This novel literaly has everything.  It is a road-trip, mystery, romance, fantasy novel.  And let's not forget about the characters.  Shadow, Wednesday, Mr. Nance, Mr. Ibis, Laura, Mr. Town, ect.  The list goes on and on.  All of these characters are real.  They all have real motivations; none of their actions came off as forced to me.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.	2002-07-24

I realize it takes a big ego to do what Frank Abagnale Jr. did.  However when he talks about the hardships of prisons in France I could not bring myself to feel sorry for him.  What ever was done to him, it obviously didn't work.  He went right back to scamming people.  I know he is supposed to be some sort of Anti-Hero, but that just doesn't work for me.  He comes across more as an arrogant jerk than an anti-hero.  I just could not bring myself to root for him in anyway.  The only reason I finished the book is because I was on a long flight, and had nothing else to read.  Here's hoping the movie is better.	2002-07-09

While the story itself is fun and adventurous, I was let down by the telling of the story.  While I felt the ending was much better than the begining, the Narrator just got on my nerves.  Everytime the story got interesting and exciting, this voice would come out of nowhere and say something like, &quot;This was not the last time that Bilbo would use his sword Sting, but that is something you will hear about later.&quot;  I know that exact line was never written, but stuff like it certainly was.  I just think you shouldn't have to be told what will happen later so bluntly.  Maybe a subteler form of foreshadowing is needed, or maybe I am just overly sensitive.  In any case it was a good story, but not great.	2002-02-11

On a 5 star scale like the one here, I think 5=excellant, 4=good, 3= average, 2=has some good parts, &amp; 1=nothing good.  This book for me was slightly below average.  <br />While it did have some good parts (the cliff hanger ending, the fast pace, and the well written action scenes), it fell flat on it's face most other times.  To me the sex scenes just didn't hold true.  It seemed like they were thrown in just to have some sex in the book.  <br />Also, for someone who is supposed to be so brilliant a profiler, Alex Cross did not do much profiling.  He just sat back and let the answers fall in his lap.  First there was the daughter who gave up her father, then the suspect gave Cross a description, and then Cross saw a picture that fit the description that was given to him by the previously mentioned suspect (boy it is hard to use general terms and not give away who the Mastermind is).  All Cross kept saying was the Mastermind wanted &quot;to see these people punisher.&quot;  That is it.  That is all the profiling Cross does in the whole book.  Way to use that degree in psychology to help you track down killers.  This adventure seemed more appropriate for someone like Mike Hammer or Sam Spade, a gumshoe who finds clues or gets confessions or information from a thug by threats or violence.  Cross' big scene where I thought he would show off his smarts was when he and his collegues were interviewing a suspect.  The interigator was &quot;asking the wrong questions&quot; (mind you we are never told exactly what he is asking), but this upsets the suspect.  Finally it is up to Alex Cross to ask the &quot;right&quot; questions.  What is his brilliant question that gets the right information from the suspect?  &quot;You know you have something to tell us, so why not just get it out in the open?&quot;  (Granted I am just paraphrasing the line.)  That is it.  No hostile witness/suspect to cross examine, and get talking.  Just a simple tell us what you know.  If it were thateasy, I would be a cop.  I would love to hear the &quot;wrong&quot; questions that were asked.  Was it something about which shoe does he put on first in the morning, the left or the right?  I have to admit this was my first Patterson book and it will most likely be my last.	2001-12-28

I think that what Ellis is saying is that these people are so wrapped up in themselves  that they don't realize what is going on around them.  Throughout the book  people are described by what they are wearing.  To the narrator these are  not people just articles of clothing.  To further prove this point  characters are constantly mistaking people for someone else.  <br />For people  who came looking for a slasher novel, turn away and never look back.  While  this book is the most violent disturbing thing I have ever read, even the  violence and gore serve a point.  What I feel that Ellis is saying is that  even someone who has everything can still be a violent person.  It also  shows that with all the violence going on around these characters people  don't notice, or just don't care.  The killer, Patrick Bateman, even  confesses to people, and they either ignore him, or play it off as a joke.   <br />This is definately a great read, but only if you know what to expect.	2000-01-24

Dead in the West has everything that you would expect from a great Lansdale book: offensive behavior (incest), violence (zombies eating people), characters that are easy to relate to (the doctor and his feelings towards the indian are very real), and above all humor (Lansdale's dialogue is once again unmatched).	1998-04-10

To say that it was hard to tell who was thinking what in the begining, before Felix took over the book, would be an understatement.  I found myself rereading paragraphs over and over again just so I would know who was thinking what.  This ended however when Felix joined the team.  Once that happened it turned from the Jack Crow story to the Felix story.  Crow was by far the more interesting character, he had human flaws and weaknesses, while Felix was perfect in every respect.  Here's to hoping that John Carpenter does a better job with the story when the movie, scripted and directed by Carpenter, hits the big screen.	1998-04-01

He can make history come alive for people who, like myself were not born for over 20 years after the events in this book took place.  Granted that this is a work of fiction, it brings the feel of the times to the forfront with amazing style and grace.	1998-04-01
