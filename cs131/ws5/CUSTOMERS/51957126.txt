For the reader who wishes to learn about how \\"Tommy\\" saw and fought WWII in Europe this book is a must for your collection. The book covers much of the same ground as the \\"Citizen Soldiers\\" by Ambrose and other such books by Mansoor and McManus who write about the soldier and his world rather than the campaigns and battles they fought in.  The book goes into details of the environment of the British and Canadian soldier from Normandy to the end of the war.  The topics focus on drinking, sex, discipline, looting, and the fears of the men in the 21st Army Group as they went \\"Swanning\\" across Europe.  I found the comparison between liberated France and conquered Germany quite interesting.  While not for the casual reader, the book is a must for anyone who is interested in the Commonwealth perspective of the conflict.  I read this just before Peter Whites \\"At War With the Jocks\\" and it made that book much more enjoyable.	2005-06-01

The Division was sent to NW Europe after the Market Garden fiasco (A battle the Division was planned to be in) and fought all the way to VE-Day.  White is an interesting person himself and his disdain of swearing and his gentlemanly manners are evident to the reader.  White is also an artist who contributes some of the illustrations in the book, he also illustrates to the reader the life of the British Soldier at war.  You see the life and death struggle with the enemy and the boredom of the soldiers' life in great detail.  White also details the attitude of his men towards the German civilians in the last days of the war.  The book is quite long, and I have top admit losing the author in some places (cultural differences perhaps) but overall I enjoyed the book.	2005-05-18

One fact that I noticed and liked is that Groom checked his facts and used multiple sources to corroborate the facts he presents to the reader.  The book focuses on many different levels of the conflict, from the strategic to the tactical level and also details the events that lead to the climate of 1942. Yes the book is written from an American point of view, but the scope of world events are woven into the story.  I like how Groom takes the time to briefly point out some if the issues that have raised questions in 1942 and since. This is where Groom's use of various sources comes in handy; and He gives us his opinion which he is entitled to. The book flows excellently and portrays the events in this hectic year in great detail.  As an avid reader of history I did find the book very interesting because of Groom's insight and how he is not afraid to insert a personal opinion.  If you enjoyed 1942, I recommend \\"A Storm in Flanders\\" very highly.	2005-05-18

I enjoyed \\"Tug of War\\" by the author and \\"Falaise\\" was even better.  The author gives us the first person view from American, British, Canadian, Polish, French and German participants.  The author goes from the soldier in the slit trench to the rooms where strategic decisions are made.  The book pulls no punches in its critical view of allied decision making. The story flows very well, and is a quick read.	2005-05-18

Berton writes about the genesis of the Canadian military in great detail.  I must admit to not knowing the rolling barrage and the trench raids were of Canadian origin.  After the superb set up, the battle itself shows the infusion of all of these preparations in thier victory at Vimy.

While it helps to have an understanding of the Commonwealth campaign in Normandy, it is not required.  I enjoyed Mr. Copp's unique &quot;Canadian&quot; look at much facts and criticisms leveled at the Canadian Forces.  I feel that Mr. Copp brilliantly dispelled many of the facts that have seen as truths of the campaign.  A great read for a student of Normandy, Canada, and the War.	2003-09-26

The US was not ready to go head to head with the armies in Europe already at war for over 3 years.  This book covers the period in which the US Army first took offensive action in Europe.  In spite of its size it is very readable and full of first person accounts and the view from the top.  One sees the lack of direction and experience that plagued our early war efforts, and how this army would be able to grow into the same one that stormed Normandy. The book covers the British, German, and French view as well, and talks about the inside deals made with the Vichy during Torch.	2003-02-20

I purchased this book after touring the trench exhibit at the Imperial War Museum in London.  I was a good buy, it tell the story of the Hulls Pals, a unit raised in Kitchner's Army that was spared the destruction of the Battle of the Somme.  The story is focused on a BBC television show that reenacted the formation and life of the unit.  The book goes between today and the past describing everything from trench life, to the present day re-enactors finding the uniforms uncomfortable.  Very well done, I have never seen the BBC show, however I enjoyed the book very much.	2003-02-20

With few &quot;unit histories&quot; of the Great War, this one is a must for any serious reader.  The unit, made up from the elite of NYC, and men of more humble backgrounds from upper NY, forged a unit while not heralded, most certainly worthy of this book.  The story, while never quick moving, will be interesting for the serious reader.  The unit saw serious action in breaching the Hindenburg line while attached to the British.  Good for the serious student.	2003-02-20

The story of the fall of Berlin, while told before, takes on a much more human face in this book.  The citizens of Berlin, who were told all along that they were winning the war, were faced with the grim truth.  The fight to survive and escape became the main focus for many proud Germans, and the fatalism of the die-hards leads them to their certain doom.  This is a very human tale that should not be missed.	2003-02-20

The topic, which most Americans have never read about, is very interesting and moving.  The size of the book might scare away the casual reader, however I wished it were longer.  The Isonzo campaign brought together Mussolini, Rommel, and Hemmingway, and left a mark in Italian history.  Italy was pushed into the war by the powerful military elite, the fascists; it's desire to be recognized by the Allies, and its hatred of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  These factors could not save the Italian Army from being slaughtered in the mountains and valleys of northeast Italy.  This book shows the human face to the war, and the futility of conflict.  The Italian generals never learned how to fight a modern war, and threw a whole generation of young Italians into a senseless slaughter.  The book covers the period very well, and paints a vivid picture of the campaign. I would give this a very high recommendation.	2003-02-20

The author makes this small piece of history read as a fiction novel.  It gives the detailed account of a night bomber group and the powerbrokers of the Japanese Empire. The stories, very well researched and written, never collide; yet parallel to weave a splendid story.  The action is tense and faced paced, and you will not be able to put it down.  The authors cite many other works on my bookshelves that I am more eager to read.  The stories of the night modified B-29B, flying from Guam points the roots of US strategic air power.  The story of the inner turmoil of Japan's surrender are also well done and cited.  The book covers (for me) new ground on the use and policy of the decision to drop the atomic bombs.  The third story told, the US fear of a prolonged campaign on the Japanese home islands, and the use of more atomic weapons was very interesting.  This book is for serious and casual history reader packs an atomic punch!	2003-02-20

It might be the one source for a quick look at the history of this great nation and people.  The author who spent a great amount of time in Turkey wrote about the founding of the nation, its hero Attaturk, and its rich history.  While it is very general and simple, it is a great quick snapshot into Turkey. This book is great for a traveler and a good starter for a more serious student of Turkey.	2003-02-20

I enjoyed reading this massive book cover to cover. The title \\"facing fearful odds\\" is an apt title.  The quick change from peace to war trapped these brave men on an island that would become a symbol for the war in the pacific.

The hell that was the Hurtgen was over shadowed by the battle of the Bulge, however the carnage that was endured needs to be told.  The book is a masterful account of the bravery of men who fought in tough terrain and inhospitable climates.  The book, which draws from first person accounts, tells in great detail the battle as it unfolded, and the horrors of war.  While I have read other books on the subject, this gripping, easy to read book is a must for any ETO scholar.	2003-02-20

This book relates numerous first person accounts of the Burma Campaign.  The tales come from officers, common enlisted men, to female nurses.  Their descriptions are very vivid, and show the tragic side of war.  One can also get a better feel of the Japanese culture and their views towards the war.  They view the war from the ground level, without any question such as &quot;why are we here&quot;, regardless of that they seem to have an almost casual attitude towards their own demise, which I found very interesting.  I would rate this book very highly if you have an interest in both the Pacific theater and Japan.	2001-09-07

The key fact that I learned from this book is the fate of the 3 Marines left behind during the island assault, a fact that has not gotten much attention. Wetterham personal involvement adds to the suspense as well, he accompanied JTF-FA to many of the sites in Cambodia, interviewed friends of the 3 Marines, and shows the reader the human side of this tragic event.  The reader sees very clearly the micro management from Washington and the fact that nobody had any clue on how to run a rescue operation of this type.  The book points out very well the tragedy of the event, and how servicemen were sacrificed for the prestige of the President.  Overall a great book!	2001-07-03

The accounts by Sides are very candid and graphic, which adds to the book being about both the tragedy and victory of war.

This book covers some new ground on the &quot;Great War&quot;.  It is very well written and seems to get is facts right.  I wwould recommend this book for the serious WWI reader, it ads to the history of the war even more if you are familliar with some of the other views written about in the past.  The book tells the sad story of the French who bled thier nation white during the war.  It also speaks highly of the Germans, in which Mosier describes their tactics as superior to the Allies. While they did have the edge in tactics, leaders, and terrian, thier goals politically lead to this, not the fact they were so great in the field.  I enjoyed this title, and give it 5 stars to the serious reader.	2001-05-31

Out of all the first person accounts of the Eastern front, this one comes across very differently.  Degrelle is a infamous charater of that time, and is Anti-Soviet/Pro-Nazi slant is evident to the reader.  The story is a worthy one for the experienced reader, yet way to complex for the casual WWII fan.  The discriptions, while not as good as others (ex. Sajer, Gottlieb)tells a vivid story.  The Wallonian's seemed to be in the think of many decisive battles in the war and the book shows this very clearly.

This book should be a top choice of most readers who are interested in the Normandy Campaign.  The book vividly describes the &quot;hell&quot; of this little know battle.  The first person accounts, while common in the book, really describe the problems and bravery of the Canadians during this crucial period.  The author also ties in the larger picture as well as writes about the weapons used.

With a lack or &quot;great&quot; titles on this subject, this book is my favorite if the 3 I have read.  Middlebrook has a great style in writing and all of his works always hits the mark.  While not wasting very much time with the events on the world stage, Middlebrook informs the reader on this important &quot;war&quot; fought at the height the Cold War.  The reader is given many first person accounts (mostly British, with some Argentine, and Falklander comments) which greatly add to the enjoyment of this book.  The reader can see how the UK, one of the worlds Former &quot;superpowers&quot; could very easily have lost this war and control over the Falklands.  The Land, Sea, and Air stories are all told (the Air war was lacking of the 3), as well as some of the behind the scenes maneuverings in London, Buenos Aries, and Ascension Island. Logistically the British were very challenged, this point was not delved into enough for my liking.  Over all, a great author comes through again.	2001-05-08

This body and focus of this work deal with oral histories of the men who volunteered for duty in the more elite arms of the US Army in WWII.  Each chapter covers a different period of the ETO (Torch, Anzio, Holland, Etc.) The chapter first describes the historical significance of the period, then lets the veterans tell their own personal account of what the saw, felt, and reacted to that day.  The candor of some of the stories (fright, and PTSD episodes years after), adds so much to this book.  A must for these who enjoy first hand accounts or the horrors of war.	2001-04-11

With the sparse titles available for WWI, this book tells a very good story.  Two other books that cover the US entry and involvement in the great war (while great books as well) do not tell such a rich and full story as Mead's book.  What I liked most is the way Mead describes the way the other allied nations  tried to use the US troops to help their respective nations.  It also reads like a mini bio of Gen Pershing, who was the commander, and biggest advocate of the AEF as a separate and effective fighting force.  Very detailed, yet reads like a novel.

While Ryan's &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; covers the whole battle from all points, this book tells the German story.  While books like &quot;Arhnem&quot;, and &quot;Poles Apart&quot; cover the British and Polish views, this book only tells the tale of the Germans.  While one cannot grasp the whole battle from this book, it is a great follow up for the serious reader.  The Germans where made up of rag-tag units thrown together quickly, yet beat a crack Airborne Army.  This is a must read....	2000-10-18

From cover to cover Parcells give a Tuna-eye view of a year in the life of a successful head coach.  He pulls no punches, when in comes to player (Eric Green, LT, Ray Lucas), the Refs, and various members of the NFL (Bill Belichick).  I found it very easy to read (3 days, if you are busy)and quite entertaining. For anyone who is a diehard Tuna fan, this book covers no new ground, yet you should read it anyway, for he interesting spin he gives.	2000-10-11

The 1st USV (the Rough Riders) has to be one of the most interesting units  in US military history.  The collection of characters who filled its ranks  could spawn dozens of other titles.  This book is WELL written by Teddy  Roosevelt, one of our most colorful persidents, is a frank and great  account of the life of this unit.  I found it quite enjoyable, and didn't  feel that the book was TR blowing his own horn, he cared very much for his  men and this shows through in this book.  A must for any history buff.	2000-09-06

Normally books where the author goes from first person account to account,  with a brief set up in between, is not one of my favorites.  However, this  book is so well done and ballanced you hardly notice this style.  This book  only covers the German Commonwealth point of view, so no accounts of Omaha  and Utah here (However plenty of references, such as the US refusal of  using Hobart's funnies). The book also goes right into action with only two  short chapters prior the actual invasion, and covers the time frame well  beyond the beach. The American reader will need to brush up on their  &quot;English&quot; due to the slang the British use.  Overall a must read  for any person who wishes a better look at the Eastern half of OVERLORD and  beyond.	2000-09-06

It covers the entire Arhnem operation through  British eyes.  The author goes from one personal account of the action to  another,which blends into a great tapestry of the battle.  The only  drawbacks I could comment on is the action is not fluid, Middlebrook will  cover one area of the battle (e.g. Arnhem Bridge), in its entirety, and  jump back (in time) to another section (Middlebrook tells of a British  battalion dropped in the second lift being detailed to join in the push to  the bridge,  then later tells us of the second lift in which it arrived).   The other is the lack of detail on the Polish cause in the battle. Overall  very easy to read and enjoyable.  A great companion when read with other  MARKET-GARDEN books of broader (Ryan's a Bridge Too Far) and differing  viewpoints (It Never Snows In September, the German point of view, Poles  Apart,the Polish view).  A must for any MARKET GARDEN reader.	2000-09-06

This book is a great sequel to &quot;Steel Inferno&quot;.  For readers of  the first book, some of the early parts of the book can be skipped.

The reader is introduced to the operation from its planning  phase, and continues to the operation and the impact it had.  The coverage  prior to the raid is first rate.  The actual mission itself became a bit  dis-jointed with all the Airborne teams spliting up.  With few books  covering the subject, this work is a must for those who are interested in  this op.	2000-08-04

The Italian Campagian is often overlooked by many military writers, this  book fills a gap.  I did not enjoy it as much as other WWII titles.  I  found the first few chapters quite boring, with sections of fact that were  new to me.  Until more books on the &quot;battle for the boot&quot; are  written, this book is a good addition to your collection.	2000-08-04

I read this book while I was living in Italy, so I found it even more  interesting. The fall of Rome happened the same time the Invasion of  Normandy did, and with the Battles in Western Europe raging on, this arena  of combat has allways been overlooked.  While few can name any key battles  after the fall of Rome, the combat was as heroic and bloody as in any  theater.  Brooks does an amazing job of recanting this remarkable campaign.   The level of detail is superb, and the book was very easy to read.  The  vast types of units that are described (US Mountain troops, Ethnic units,  and varoius allies) makes the book even more enjoyable.  This might be a  tough book to find, however keep trying, it is well worth it.	2000-08-04

With &quot;Cassino:The Hollow Victory&quot; by Ellis being the standard,  this book is a close second.  It is also much easier to find, which avid  military readers must keep in mind.  The book starts out with the overall  situation of the Italian front, describes the importance of Cassino, and  descibes to battle to the reader. It seems like every book on the Italian  Campaign sets up the books topic (compare with books on the Bulge and  D-Day), the reader who is knowledgeable will breeze thru it and get to the  heart of the book. If you can't find Ellis's work, grab this one.	2000-08-04

With ony a few great book on the the Hurtgen Forrest campaign (by Mac Donald, and Miller, both hard to get), this work will stand out as being one of the best.  This book is pure Astor, gripping  first person accounts (US point of view), and historical detail will keep  you reading cover to cover.  As a fan of Astor, I rate this ahead of some  of this others (The Greatest War, Operation Iceberg, and a Blood Dimmed  Tide), for the simple reason that he wrote on a battle that has often been  ignored.  Astor also takes you in to Roer campaign as well.  If you like  Astor, The Hurtgen, or the movie &quot;When Trumpets Fade&quot; buy this  book.	2000-07-28

After reading Syndor's &quot;Soldiers of Destrcution&quot; and really enjoying that book, I allways wondered if their were other titles on the infamous Waffen-SS.  This book is a must for anyone who enjoys this  subject.  I found it a quick and easy read.  Lucas tell the history of this  unit in his own words and the gripping stories of it veterans.  The units  battles on the eastern front are covered very well, however some of the  west front battles could use a bit more attention.  The last chapter in the  book covers the units flight to the west in order to surrender to the  Western Allies was brief, but very interesting.	2000-07-24

This book is such a must for any WWII historian.  It is quite readable, in spite the rich detail it goes  into.  The section (about 1/3 of the book) on the units exploits during the  Battle of the Bulge, must rank among some the best first person accounts  ever written!  After reading that section I can see how &quot;Those damned  Engineers&quot; ruined Hitler's winter offensive.  The section on the  bridging of the Rhine is another epic.  I knew prior to reading this book  that they did build the bridge, I was still hanging on every page, as if I  was reading a novel.  Col Pergrin's love and compassion for his troops is  also well noted, he seems like a great leader (I wish we still had a few  like him).  One problem I had (very minor) was my lack of knowledge of the  various types of bridges, which does not take away from this book, but if  included would add so much to it.   Overall I loved it!	2000-07-24

Books	5	47	53	N	N	Great book, a must for a history buff	While not much is written about the Boxer Rebellion, Diana Preston, does a great job.  I could not put this down, it reads like a novel.  Preston vividly re counts the events leading up to the rebellion, as well as the  conflict itself. The discription of the charaters in the same detailed  light (the sexual habits of the players is also mentioned, but not over  done)places a face on the conflict. It also descibes the awkward union of  the world powers that sent troops to rescue the legations in Peking. What I  noted the most is that in some aspects  China has changed very little.  The  maps and pictures help with the story.  I liked this book very much, and  being an avid history reader I could not tell if this was a novel or a  history book. If you are looking for a great read that covers this period  (in which so few books are written) buy Preston's book.	2000-06-26

Lets a admit one thing, in the movie &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; you favorite charater was General Sosabowski, played by Gene Hackman.  If it was, or you have ever had any interest in The General, the Polish  Independant Parachute Brigade, or the battle of Arnhem, you must read this  book.  The author is an expert on the Polish military, and his great  writing comes through in this work.  The book tells the tale of Sosabowski,  and his men from the fall of Poland in 1939, to thier heroic action in  Operation MARKET GARDEN.  The book is told from the soldiers view, which  graphically comes alive for the reader.  It also cover the units history  (Rather the personnel) up until 1992.  One of the best unit histories that  I have read.	2000-06-18

This book is a great first person account on the hell of the Russian Front. Bidermann's account of his  AT gun crew knocking out Soviet tanks in the the Crimea, reads like a  novel.  Bidermann also fills parts of the Divisions (132nd ID) history that  he himself was not present for with great detail.

The author has a personal connection to the division (his father commanded it),  and tells its story with a great level of detail.  While the story is not  as colorful as some of the Guard formations (books on the 29th, 45th and  30th have more of a regional flavor) it still covered some new ground about  these unique formations.  If the reader is familiar with the Army's WWII  manpower and unit/personnel formation policies, some parts of the begining  of the book can be skipped.	2000-06-13

I can never read enough about the Normandy Invasion.  Out of all the titles, I liked this one the best (sorry Mr Ambrose), it tells the story of the &quot;Blue and Gray&quot; division,  as well as the bloody assault on Omaha Beach.  It breaks down the formation  of a US infantry division in great detail.  Detail, is also the best word  to describe the way Balkoski re creates one of the most heroic days in US  Military history.

While its history is not unlike most other regiments, the appeal of this book is the heroic tale it tells.  Formed by frontiersmen and city folk, the regiment is brought into service  at Ft Snelling and travels east.   The battle accomplishments are well  noted by the author in great detail.  The pinnacle of this work is their  charge on the second day of the battle of Gettysburg.  The reader will  place the 1st Minnesota along the lines of the 20th Maine, a Union regiment  who saved the Army of Potomac from defeatin the battle.

It reads very well and spares no small detail. It gives you a &quot;leather-necks&quot; view of the the war in France.	2000-03-08

Syndor's book is a great work on the tale of the SSTK Division.  Syndor shows the inception of the division from men of the  concentration camp system, describes its fight for respectability among its  army peers, and reviews its record as a crack fighting division.  The book  reads very well.  The only negative criticism I do have is that the maps  could be better and detailed more.  This not withstanding this is a must  for anyone who wishes to know and understand the combat arm of Hitler's  personal army of destruction	2000-03-08
