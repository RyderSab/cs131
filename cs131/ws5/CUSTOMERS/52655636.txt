On February 12, 2003, former CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg appeared at the University of Miami with MSNBC's Chris Matthews. Within 30 minutes, a hostile audience of college students was won over - listening to Goldberg calmly handling Matthews's rapid-fire questions. His composure suggested he might someday be a commentator about politics, culture and the media with wide appeal.<br /><br />Last week, Goldberg said what shocks him about a \\"smart and sensitive liberal\\" like Jon Stewart (Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\"), is Stewart believes cultural issues don't matter.<br /><br />But in \\"100 People Who Are Screwing Up America,\\" Goldberg says they DO matter, and he explores how 100 people are most responsible, in his view, for America's cultural decline.<br /><br />Goldberg, who spent most of his life as a Jewish-American Democrat in New York, says political correctness - that is, trying hard to not offend, trying to be tolerant about almost everything - has rightly or wrongly defined liberalism to the average Joe on the street who lives, as he says, between Manhattan and Malibu.<br /><br />His book suggests that being politically correct - to embrace the hard left portion of the Democratic party, for example - prevents you from being judgmental. In otherwords, if you consider yourself a hard liberal - you might be uncomfortable loudly criticizing things parents with common sense, for example - might deem harmful to their children.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />Goldberg is now hated by many liberals and joins consumer activist and ABC reporter John Stossel as \\"traitors\\" - for refusing to agree, issue-by-issue, with the Democratic party line.<br /><br />\\"100 People\\" includes nearly 70 pages of introductory chapters summarizing issues which bother Goldberg. They include the \\"unfair\\" comparison of the embarrassing Abu Ghraib prison scandal in Iraq to the truly horrific My Lai massacre in Vietnam - as well as the influence on American culture - of celebrities, situation comedies, reality TV, popular music, the news media, trial lawyers, \\"racial enforcers,\\" white collar \\"thugs\\" and angry feminists.<br /><br />Flag-waving patriotism - as defined by the Greatest Generation of the 1940s - has become embarrassing to some liberals. They say \\"we support our troops, but we don't support the war,\\" even though \\"our troops\\" are volunteers. Hearing mixed messages (and \\"our troops\\" do hear them), must be enormously puzzling to soldiers in combat.<br /><br />Hate-filled gangsta rap - not standard rap or hip-hop - is an abomination, says Goldberg. Freedom of speech protects it, but if you're reluctant to criticize its impact on your 10-year old, you might be a hard liberal.<br /><br />Liberals attacking conservatives for \\"blurring the lines separating church and state\\" - have trouble criticizing hard line Democrats Jesse Jackson or Al Sharpton - for bringing politics into their own churches. It's \\"politically incorrect\\" to point out such \\"exceptions,\\" because liberals regard them as one of \\"their own.\\" And the fact they're preachers AND African-American - is the elephant in the room liberals dare not address loudly in public.<br /><br />Conversely, white evangelicals - who similarly inject their views into the political and cultural debate - are regarded as extremists who are sending the U.S. toward fascism. It's a double standard.<br /><br />-----------------<br /><br />In \\"100 People,\\" something has gone awry with Goldberg's old Democratic party - when people like himself, Stossel, Zell Miller, Rudolph Giuliani - even still liberal actors such as Ron Silver - switch parties or loudly disagree with portions of today's Democratic party. Hard liberals say if you like Bush or even \\"some\\" of what he represents - you can't be taken seriously. This is being thrown at Goldberg - as it was thrown at former Senator Zell Miller - an ex-Marine who had the highest approval ratings as Georgia's governor before he decided to back Bush.<br/><br />Mr. Goldberg is upset with a cultural and intellectual elitism - that he believes previously did not exist among liberals. He's puzzled how the party that brought us civil rights, FDR, Truman, JFK, Martin Luther King - could allow itself to be hijacked by the wine-and-cheese gangs of hard left liberals and Hollywood - who believe Republicans are racist, fascist, Bible-toting homophobes.<br /><br />Is the cultural divide overstated? Mr. Goldberg says no.<br /><br />There's been a seismic shift. You hear more about high- and low-profile Democrats - \\"switching\\" to the Republican party - than the other way around. Democrats used to rule. Now elections that were never close, are now VERY close. Democrats lost EVERY state in the South last November. Southerners were a \\"gimme\\" for Democrats during most of the 20th century. Any political party willing to concede the South - must now win more than 70 percent of the vote in other states - to take the White House or to have any impact on legislation. And EVERY Democrat after JFK who became President - was a Southerner. This is too compelling to ignore.<br /><br />By implication, Goldberg is illustrating the decline of the Democratic party, since most on his list are indeed liberals who have aligned themselves with Ted Kennedy, the New York Times and Hollywood.<br /><br />Where \\"100 People\\" falters is the lack of a stand-alone chapter explaining why some lightning-rod figures did NOT make his list - such as Ann Coulter, Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity - while others like Michael Savage did. The Clintons did NOT make his list. But conservative judge Roy Moore (10 Commandments in Alabama's high court) does - for practicing the same \\"judicial activism\\" Republicans claim is being practiced by Democrats.<br /><br />Overall, Mr. Goldberg's first \\"water cooler\\" book still succeeds - because it invites debate about a subjective \\"list\\" from a former liberal-turned-moderate not known for screaming - who quickly admits he and his list aren't perfect. Its success could spawn later editions, creating a \\"franchise\\" similar to yearly-updated almanacs.<br /><br />All lists are fun. But Goldberg is serious - and his views about the impact of public figures and institutions on American society should not, in my view - be dismissed.exist among liberals.

Since 9/11, I've read or viewed more than 200 items related to the terrorist attacks, some good, some bad.<br /><br />In 2005, we SHOULD be better at sifting and digesting information about 9/11, much of it covered in previous works. And so it was with this backdrop, that last week I cracked open \\"102 Minutes\\" with trepidation, wondering aloud whether what was inside could possibly be much different from what I've read or seen previously.<br /><br />In \\"102 Minutes,\\" authors Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn have captured the sights, sounds and smells of that day. Nothing new there. They've also put the reader INSIDE the towers. Again, not new. Think of Picciotto's \\"Last Man Down\\" from 2002.<br /><br />But Dwyer and Flynn have gone further. With \\"102 Minutes,\\" they've largely (but not exclusively), put the reader in the shoes of the regular office worker, not the rescuer. Moreover, they've captured, in page after page - the horrible feeling of what near total deprivation of information going on OUTSIDE the towers - must have been like for those trapped INSIDE.<br /><br />If you're on the 81st floor of either tower, how could you possibly know that your \\"minutes\\" on earth were numbered? Even as the first tower fell, most in the second tower just heard a horrific \\"noise.\\" They didn't know.<br /><br />In two gripping nights, I pored through the pages of this astonishing book and found myself asking the same questions repeatedly. Would I have waited things out, never knowing I was minutes away from death?  Would I have reacted calmly seeing smoke? Would I have accepted my fate and gone down with the buildings?  Or would I have jumped?<br /><br />Combine eyewitness accounts, told in almost novelistic fashion - with parallel stories, photos and diagrams showing interior configurations of the towers, the location of support columns, elevators and stairwells - and you end up with a reader-friendly product that in my mind, is likely to retain its relevance many decades hence - about events within the Twin Towers on the most unforgettable day in American history, equaling or surpassing December 7, 1941 in terms of its impact on our view of world.<br /><br />We know the ending. But on that day, many of the 12,000 who escaped - and all of the 2,749 who died - did not. And this is the foundation upon which \\"102 Minutes\\" rests. Only in hindsight, things which should've seemed obvious were not. You're forced as a reader to suspend harsh judgment against people who made errant decisions based on scant information.<br /><br />Except the terrorists, there are no villains. Yet it's still aggravating to read about the decades of rivalry and the lack of pro-active cooperation between the New York police and fire units who came together that day. Their bravery is not diminished, but it hurts to think that the lack of communication, the rolls of red tape, as illustrated by higher grade radios sitting unused in the trunks of cars - that the competitive spirit in the culture of rescuers wearing disparate uniforms - may have been partially responsible for the loss of some of their own.<br /><br />Weave together stories of those who survived by luck - with stories of those trapped above the impact zones who hoped they would escape or be rescued - throw in doses of madness, tales of brave rescue units working against each other, not on the same page despite their best intentions - and you have \\"102 Minutes,\\" a book that offers drama and heroism on a titanic scale.<br /><br />Long after other 9/11-related books disappear off the nation's bookshelves, long after the final report of the 9/11 Commission is covered with dust, \\"102 Minutes\\" will still feel like a stunning work of reporting that, because it doesn't aspire to be a modern day non-fiction classic - has, in my view - alongside Smith's \\"Report from Ground Zero\\" and D'Souza's \\"What's So Great About America,\\" become just that.

US	52655636	R3VPDUA4G0T7P4	1400060737	595261029	The Birth of Venus	Books	4	470	517	N	N	How real is the "liberating" message of "The Birth of Venus?	Sarah Dunant's \\"The Birth of Venus\\" feels similar to Tracy Chevalier's \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" and Susan Vreeland's \\"Girl in the Hyacinth Blue.\\"  All three are works of historical fiction that have the ability to convince, albeit fleetingly, that they must be true.<br /><br />However, \\"The Birth of Venus\\" isn't based on the Botticelli masterpiece that still resides in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.  It's based on the metaphorical \\"birth\\" -- and transformation -- of a girl-turned-woman whose single-mindedness is constantly thwarted by actions which force her to conform to 15th century Florentine society.<br /><br />I'm not big on novels associated with the feminist school of thought that suggests forbidden romance, in all of its forms, brings liberation.  Yet I was blindsided by Dunant's \\"The Birth of Venus\\" - especially its socko-ending - coming from an author better known for her crime novels and TV appearances in the United Kingdom.<br /><br />Dunant's accomplishment:  She establishes familiar plot threads about her protagonist, Alessandra.  Hers is a page-turning, rebellious story.  You start to feel smug because you think you've figured out how everything's going to end.  But just when you think you're heading toward a familiar train wreck, Dunant puts you through many unpredictable (but mostly plausible) 90-degree plot turns that are wonderfully intriguing.<br /><br />\\"The Birth of Venus\\" may not be high literature, but it's Dunant's best work to date.  Her love for her adopted city of Florence is obvious.  She goes out of her way to spin a fictional tale that's rooted in well-researched, historical reality.  The \\"superstars\\" of the Renaissance make their appearances, but never in a jarring, manipulative or name-dropping way.  They're part of the landscape.  And if you know the geography of Old Florence, you also know that even today, it's small enough that you can't help running into these guys.<br /><br />So what keeps this book from perfection?  In my view, just two things:<br /><br />First, modern slang occasionally surfaces that feels incongruent to 21st century readers who've been drawn into a setting that's more than 500 years old.  Yeah, I know we're reading a \\"fictional translation\\" of Italian narration to English, but it's still a little jarring to read present-day colloquialisms sprinkled throughout a novel that's mostly placid in tone.  Contrast this with erotic passages which for the most part, are devoid of crudeness (though at times described a little too self-consciously).<br /><br />Second, about those erotic passages.  There aren't many.  They're executed, for the most part, with great sensitivity.  I hate sex described in clinical terms.  But a couple of times Dunant comes too close to projecting thoughts into Alessandra's narration that feel pretentious, a little too lyrical or metaphorical, even from the voice of an adult who's \\"looking backward.\\"  Do women really string metaphors about sex together, as you read here, even in their most reflective and introspective moments?  As a result, what's supposed to \\"feel\\" like sexual \\"liberation\\" rings a little false.  And I still don't get the stuff involving the tattoos (you'll know what I mean when you get to it).<br /><br />Suspending disbelief is obviously required when great figures creep into a novel.  \\"The Birth of Venus\\" weaves its \\"tale\\" cleverly, but I wish Dunant's Alessandra had gone no further when she describes the return, years later, of the man who remains an important figure in her life.<br /><br />She beautifully says, \\"We had always been bound to each other through the power of longing, even when we understood nothing of desire.\\"<br /><br />I wished Dunant had stopped there.  Instead, she plows ahead with the inevitable \\"scene\\" that would've been better suggested than described in a way that feels a little forced, posed and \\"artsy.\\"  I became aware of Dunant's writing.  And this isn't supposed to happen.  A great story is supposed to make you less conscious of great prose.<br /><br />I'm still baffled about the mysterious man who's never identified by name.  We're given a few clues, but he remains a cryptic figure, a brooding and tortured artist who returns years later so worldly and wise.  He reads like every woman's fantasy, a Renaissance romantic too good to be true.<br /><br />In the end, these may be small quibbles.<br /><br />It may not be necessary to know the \\"Who's Who\\" of the Renaissance, e.g., Savonarola, Medici, the whole lot of 'em, and it may not be necessary to walk the streets of present-day Florence to \\"get\\" what's in \\"The Birth of Venus.\\"  But they do enhance the enjoyment of a story that's set in one of the world's most romantic cities.  I hope readers less familiar with Florentine art and history get the same wallop I did after finishing it.<br /><br />A helpful tip:  remember this book is being told in the first person AND in the past tense.  This way, when you reach the final 30 pages of Alessandra's story, you'll realize you're being set up for a twist.<br /><br />To my relief, it's unpredictable and immensely satisfying.  Without giving it away, \\"The Birth of Venus\\" closes unconventionally yet beautifully; optimistically yet realistically; quietly yet without being thrown into the throes of depression.<br /><br />I still prefer non-fiction over fiction.  But as I once wrote about another historical novel I equally enjoyed, if more books were written like Dunant's \\"The Birth of Venus,\\" I'd stop going to the movies.man who's never identified by name.

This little book about punctuation has gotta be one of the most unlikely non-fiction bestsellers in recent memory.<br /><br />For most of John Q. Public, a PURE 'reference' book about punctuation will cure insomnia better than a double-dose of sleeping pills.<br /><br />But 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' is different.  It's in the 'reference' AND 'humor' sections at most libraries and booksellers like Amazon.com.<br /><br />Author Lynne Truss - a novelist, radio personality and a former television AND sports critic for the Times of London (geez, what a resume) - obviously isn't the first to say that punctuation MATTERS.<br /><br />But she's the first to scream her case globally, armed with a comical and politically incorrect poisonous pen.  In truth, Truss doesn't take herself too seriously, but she gets to choose what's good and bad, which offenses are egregious and which aren't worth bursting a vein.  Her 'zero tolerance' mantra is actually a selective ruse.  Bad signage in particular gets a big-time skewering.<br /><br />Where Truss succeeds best, though, is going for the jugular to push her point, using hyperbole that's laugh-out-loud funny.  Examples:<br /><br />* If you persist in writing, 'Good food at it's best,' (instead of the correct possessive, 'its'), 'you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.'<br /><br />* Punctuation vigilantes who spot offenses must be armed with tools, such as:  correction fluid, big marking pens, a bucket of paint, a big brush - and - a gun.<br /><br />There are patches in 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' where you want to shake Truss silly for pounding you with one history lesson after another.  Some of it quite dull.  Her stories about the origins of punctuation marks - the changing acceptance of apostrophes, periods, commas, colons, semicolons, dashes, hyphens, parentheses, brackets, question marks and periods - aren't as effective as hard examples about their proper use today.  Although I did laugh at her rueful comment about how upset she is for not volunteering to meet a centuries-old punctuation advocate to have his babies (Aldus Manutius the 'Elder, 1450-1515).  As if she had a choice.<br /><br />'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' is a reference (each punctuation mark has its own chapter), but you can easily thumb (or skip) through some of her prose to get to the meatiest examples.  Truss is best when she demonstrates how two sentences, for example, identical in every way EXCEPT for their punctuation marks, can have opposite meanings:<br /><br />A woman, without her man, is nothing.<br /><br />A woman:  without her, man is nothing.<br /><br />Meanwhile, it's a little disrupting to see what's OK in the U.K. that's NOT OK in America (putting a period outside a quotation mark at the end of a sentence, for example, instead of inside it).  But these differences are noted and Truss doesn't force British usage down your throat.<br /><br />Finally, to critics who say the 'better book' about punctuation is 'Elements of Style' by William Strunk and E. B. White:  Well yeah, of course.  But have you ever tried reading 'Elements of Style' from cover-to-cover?  It's pure reference, not entertainment.  'Eats, Shoots and Leaves' is irreverent, but not irrelevant.  And Lynne Truss, to her credit, pays proper homage to both pioneers.  She even revisits a 1999 Washington Post parody by columnist Bob Hirschfield about the 'Strunkenwhite Virus,' which rejected e-mails with improper punctuation, bringing commerce and productivity to a screeching halt.<br /><br />It's no crime taking on an otherwise dull subject and loading it up with laughs.  Truss obviously wants to reach more than just educators, librarians, writers and readers.<br /><br />With 'Eats, Shoots and Leaves,' she's done it.  So put 'em both on your shelf.per use today.

US	52655636	R2OQMHRVFBRXRK	0060763957	967480762	Michael Moore Is a Big Fat Stupid White Man	Books	4	29	35	N	N	Is this book all lies? A view from a Michael Moore fan...	The worst thing about 'Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man' is its title.<br /><br />Regan Books, an imprint of Harper Collins - the same publisher of Moore's 'Stupid White Men' - obviously wants to sell more books. This gives the misleading impression of yet another anti-liberal screed. A better, less shrill title for this book would've been 'Michael Moore, Enigmatic Genius' - because that's who he is and what's inside is largely presented, in my view - with rational anger, not screaming (despite a definitely snide tone).<br /><br />'Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man' is a re-hash of what we already know about Moore. What's devastating, however, is the cumulative effect of reading all of Moore's failures (and successes) catalogued in one volume, which includes more than 30 pages of 'notes and sources' that all historians demand in a non-fiction work seeking to take itself seriously.<br /><br />For a long time, I've been just a hair short of revering Michael Moore. He's never dull and is blessed with wonderful gifts. I've followed him from 'Roger and Me' to his cancelled stints with 'TV Nation' at two networks, to his bestsellers, 'Downsize This!,' 'Stupid White Men,' 'Dude, Where's My Country?' and to his masterpieces, 'Bowling for Columbine' and 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' He's fabulous taking complicated subjects, making them provocative, simple to understand and wildly humorous and entertaining.<br /><br />Yet while gaining popularity and power, 'Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man' reveals how Moore has become incrementally more reckless, exposing weaknesses that have become, with each passing month, too compelling to dismiss, even for fans of his work like me. I miss the old Michael Moore.<br /><br />While never agreeing COMPLETELY with his politics, I think Moore is a brilliant satirist, perhaps the finest of his generation. His work has a point of view and a lot of humor. But I didn't think Moore himself wanted people to take his views literally.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />'Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man' states that Moore's 'truths' are meant to be taken as fact. Any attempt to get Moore to reconcile his 'facts' with historical records, has been occasionally met with histrionic rage. He has threatened lawsuits, accused skeptics - even some of us who remain fans of his work but not his politics - of being 'Attacko Wackos' engaged in a 'conspiracy' against him.<br /><br />Authors Hardy and Clarke (who should be described as compilers, since some material isn't their own) seek to undermine Moore's credibility. You can argue they haven't done it well, but to me, having READ this book, I can now say they've planted seeds of doubt bigger than the size of watermelons. They're clearly unafraid of Moore successfully winning a libel lawsuit against them.<br /><br />By tracking Moore's life and work, from birth to present day, the authors demonstrate an inescapable pattern of contradiction, manipulation, paranoia and hypocrisy that's difficult to ignore. What I felt in the past was just 'nitpicking against Moore,' is blown apart by snapshot-in-time, side-by-side comparisons of his life and work, with events as they actually occurred, quoting original source material.<br /><br />'Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man' is also eerily clairvoyant about 'Fahrenheit 9/11.' The authors couldn't review it before its release, but they accurately predict some of 'Fahrenheit's' themes, based on what Moore presented in his book, 'Dude, Where's My Country?' It turns out the stories about the Carlyle group - to the 'escaping' Bin Ladens, to that pipeline in Afghanistan - are presented here AND in 'Fahrenheit.' The authors try to debunk some Moore's most important accusations - that they correctly anticipated - would appear in 'Fahrenheit.'<br /><br />Having finished 'Michael Moore is a Big Fat Stupid White Man,' I still regard 'Fahrenheit 9/11' as a masterpiece of partisan entertainment. But it's NOT a CBS documentary.

Uh-oh.  Lawrence McAuliffe's book reads, initially at least, like another tale shoe-horned into that dreary subset of military fiction set during or in the aftermath of Vietnam.  It's a genre that conditions me to expect prose that will force me to slog my way through many grimy and ugly details, underscoring the realities of war and its horrors.  This, in my view, is why books about war, be they fiction or non-fiction, are rarely popular with the greater body of readers who actually BUY books.  And that's women, not men.  And many of the men and women who do buy such books have already been touched in some way by similar sagas or lived through them.<br />\\"Purple Sun\\" is about a three-decade quest by two Vietnam vets to uncover the mystery of a third man, a wounded private, Billy Kern, who was left behind.  Private Kern escapes death, but he doesn't come home.  He seemingly \\"chooses\\" to disappear in the jungles of Vietnam.  What happened to him?  Did he become a monk as some believe?  If so, why?  If not, did he just die in battle?  If so, where and how?<br />After Chapter 4, \\"Purple Sun\\" takes off like a rocket, with spare, cut-to-the-chase prose that quickly moves the reader across vast swaths of geography and time.  It has an \\"I can't stop reading\\" quality many other authors never achieve -- simply because they try too hard to articulate the impossible -- cramming so many adjectives into paragraphs requiring laser beam attention, forcing one to read passages over and over again until they stick (and sometimes they never do).<br />Not so with \\"Purple Sun.\\"  McAuliffe's triumph is his ability to pull you into a seemingly complex story using simple and compelling prose, generously using what I can only describe as the novelistic equivalent of cinematic \\"jump cuts.\\"  He uses a lot of 'em and they work.  The result is a 30-year spiritual journey that feels like 30 minutes, with zero degradation in the plausibility of the story.  (At least until the end, which is Kubrick-like in execution.)<br />The first 220 pages of \\"Purple Sun\\" -- going from Vietnam to Wyoming to Vietnam and back again -- have an unflinching clarity that makes you give a damn about what happens.  The mystery of Private Kern is so compelling, you pray for a bolt-of-lightning payoff.  You get it and you don't.  By the end, the purpose of the journey is accomplished, but I still came away asking many questions about the missing Private Kern.<br />Without giving the ending away, we ultimately learn what happened to him.  But it's a \\"what-you-see-is-what-you-get\\" resolution.  The type of reader you consider yourself to be will determine whether you think this is a strong or weak conclusion.  The \\"redemption\\" described on the cover of this book (an over-used word found in the marketing summaries of many novels), is left open to debate.  Any uplift is subtle at best.  It puts pressure on you, the reader, to draw your own conclusions.  This is what Yann Martel's Booker Prize-winning spiritual novel, \\"The Life of Pi\\" attempted, with astounding results in 2002.<br />However, unlike \\"The Life of Pi,\\" there are no clues nor allegorical references that amuse.  There are no clear rationalizations for what happens.  There's humor in \\"Purple Sun,\\" but not much.  This is a straight-ahead tale with two significant flashbacks, leading to an ending that may leave some readers feeling short-changed.<br />I believe this was by design.  Private Kern's actions are purposely ambiguous, riddled with a type of monastic/theistic drive and symbolism beyond the reach of mathematics, science, human logic and reason.  This may satisfy contemplative readers and war-scarred veterans to whom I'm forever grateful for their service -- but may prove maddening to secular types who scoff at ethereal conclusions -- which come after 25 fabulous chapters filled with brilliantly simple prose and zero false profundities.<br />Hence I think \\"Purple Sun\\" is just short of great.  The \\"Life of Pi\\" and \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" -- two \\"crossover\\" books which, while also not perfect, explore themes associated with the mysteries of the human mind and healing powers of spirituality -- are blessed with near perfect conclusions.  The last paragraph of \\"The Dogs of Babel\\" in particular -- has a soaring quality that satisfies readers, secular and non-secular alike -- without proffering clear answers.<br />\\"Purple Sun\\" comes close to achieving the same.  While it doesn't take a great leap for me to ponder the \\"whys\\" of Private Kern's fate, I confess it was strange to be presented, after more than 20 chapters of unbridled clarity, such an ambiguous conclusion.  After all, we've traveled thousands of miles with these guys looking for Private Kern.  But we know nothing about Kern's inner thoughts.  We only know what others hear and see.  And he's the mysterious centerpiece around which everything revolves.<br />I think \\"de-mystifying\\" his fate a little bit could've been accomplished without a literary sledgehammer or overt preachiness.  A single additional explanatory sentence, a piece of dialogue perhaps, would've given Private Kern's fate a less obscure meaning for those of us who forever aspire to understand our brave men and women in uniform who sacrifice themselves in the name of a noble concept (a sovereign nation with liberties) with equal spiritual significance.<br />Minor flaws aside, anyone can tackle \\"Purple Sun.\\"  It doesn't have the standard Hollywood ending, and that's a good thing.  However, be prepared for a conclusion that may cause endless debates among mainstream readers.  I was happy to read this book.s, science, human logic and reason.

Back in 2000, &#34;Girl With a Pearl Earring&#34; became one of the first major novels I had read since John Irving's &#34;The World According to Garp&#34; more than 25 years ago.  As an ex-journalist, I can't explain my aversion to fiction, other than to say that anything akin to &#34;once upon a time&#34; is already six feet under to me.  Truth has always seemed stranger than fiction.<br /><br />I was attracted to this book for one reason.  I was at the Maurithuis Museum at the Hague in the Netherlands in 1996 and saw Vermeer's &#34;Girl with a Pearl Earring&#34; and &#34;A View of Delft&#34; (both pictured on the book's dust jacket) in person.  They are the most unforgettable paintings I have ever seen.  Vermeer's paintings are incredibly hypnotic, drawing us into a time and place that no longer exists.  By virtue of thousands of brush strokes, we are pulled into a time warp which places us into a scene the same surreal way that an old photograph does.<br /><br />This is what author Tracy Chevalier has wonderfully achieved.  Unlike other paintings riddled with religious motifs, nearly all of Vermeer's 35 known works have the ability to force you to think, &#34;Yes, this must have been what ordinary life in Holland was like more than 300 years ago.&#34;  And one can be quite moved by this even if one loathes cheap sentiment.<br /><br />The book's triumph is taking the tangible, that is, the painting which still resides in the Netherlands -- fusing it with what historians know about life in 17th century Holland -- and then concocting something that not only is believable, but plausible, even though our minds are telling us, &#34;But this is still a piece of fiction.&#34;<br /><br />Griet, our heroine, does seems mature beyond her years.  Yet her thoughts are not unbelievable when we remember our own youth, what scared us, moved us, what made us care about what others thought.  We felt wise beyond our years.  Only later did we discover how naive we were, how much more we had yet to learn.<br /><br />Griet's narration reads better if we imagine her telling her story from the point of view of an adult reflecting about her thoughts when she was 16, and not in the present tense, as presented here.  Still, there's a soft rhythm emanating from her narration that doesn't seem pretentious in a way that would call attention to the author's writing style, the mortal sin of any book.  When something is good, we don't think about how words are strung together.  We are so enthralled that time loses all meaning, like a dog whose only notion of it is something nebulous that must last forever.<br /><br />The events which force Griet to work for Vermeer and the tragedy that occurs later, have less emotional impact on Griet as a 17th century girl than if she were a 20th century girl.  They are treated without sappiness.  We watch Griet's transformation as an attractive young woman who is already aware of her effect on men, to something more complex and cunning.  We listen to her efforts to de-feminize herself to deflect unwanted attention, her silly and resigned rationalizations in her trading of dispassionate &#34;minor&#34; sexual favors to achieve her goals, however vague they may seem.  We deduce that Griet is a creature of the moment in her actions, but oddly, in her mind, she is also a girl who has one eye on her own future, as well as her family's.<br /><br />The greatest scenes in the book are the conversations, sparse as they are.  When Vermeer tackles the complex subject of religious attitudes toward paintings and whether they have any relevance to the viewer, despite the fact that his paintings are not riddled with religious themes -- he does so with such clarity and logic -- that it has you soaring into the stratosphere, like listening to Einstein breaking down the theory of relativity into simple language that anyone can understand without being offended.<br /><br />In addition, Griet's efforts to articulate her emotional feelingsabout the master Vermeer are wonderfully conveyed.  She is explicit in almost every other emotion, but never about her growing romantic feelings toward Vermeer.  Yet it is clear in her narration that she loves Vermeer in her own special way.  This, to me, is what others have long said to be the essence of romance.  It is the notion of &#34;what if?&#34; and all that it entails, while the rest is just &#34;life as it all turned out.&#34;<br /><br />The few sexual passages in this book do seem off-kilter to its mostly placid and intelligent tone.  They were necessary to illustrate Griet's awareness of her allure, as well as her low self-image, which betray her confident narrative.  But it would have been better to allude rather than to describe what seems mildly lurid.  My first thought was, &#34;Well, here's the 'PG-13' portion of the book which calls attention to itself.&#34;  The placid tone Chevalier has painstakingly created is now a little jarring, a mild rant against the sufferings inflicted upon women by bestial men throughout time.<br /><br />The book's ending (without giving it away) is &#34;Zhivago-esque&#34; (the movie and not the Pasternak book, though purists say one should never compare apples to oranges).  It is soft, oblique and rich with a wonderful sense of irony and closure.  It has a completeness that takes many other authors several hundred more pages to convey.<br /><br />Turning fiction into reality, mixing facts with a creative extrapolation of how the &#34;Girl with a Pearl Earring&#34; came to be, is the magic all of the world's best writers desire.  Minor faults aside, Chevalier's account is brilliant enough that in my mind, Vermeer's painting is now inextricably linked to Chevalier's book.<br /><br />The girl now has a name and her name is Griet.  The result, quite eerily, is this.

US	52655636	R1S5WYOX30XJPR	0871136791	11590154	Cold Mountain	Books	4	54	65	N	N	PLEASE Read...Tips to Conquering &quot;Cold Mountain&quot;	I consider myself a pretty sophisticated reader. But I share many of the same sentiments others have about the titanic struggle to conquer &quot;Cold Mountain.&quot;<br />&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; has two primary stories. The first is about a wounded Civil War deserter named Inman who spends much of his time wandering home, facing obstacles to return to a beloved woman he hasn't seen in years. The second is about this beloved Ada and her friend Ruby, who transform the land upon which they live into a self-sufficient farm. Flashbacks recall things as they were between Inman and Ada before the war. These memories drive Inman home. Will he make it? If he does, will Ada remember? If she remembers, will she return his love? If these parallel stories intersect, will there be a good payoff?<br />I wish what I've described was as simple as the book. &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; reads like a reflective diary with microscopic details that do little to drive this plot quickly forward. Worse, UNLIKE a diary, it's told in the third person. It's not, &quot;I thought this&quot; or &quot;I did that.&quot; It's &quot;Inman thought this&quot; and &quot;Ada felt that.&quot; Yet this isn't a dumb book. Ambitious, yes, but trash this isn't.<br />But who wants to read something that feels like work? I wondered, &quot;why am I torturing myself?&quot; Just to prove I can do it because it won a big-time award? Just to be a pseudo-intellectual hot-shot? Of course I don't want an easy, dumbed-down read, but I don't want a biology, geology or botany lesson on every page. Yet I finished &quot;Cold Mountain.&quot;<br />So why am I still giving it four stars?<br />First, some tips about how I got through it. Just like a mountain that can only be conquered in little steps, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; requires, even for sophisticated readers, a level of concentration I haven't devoted to any book since college. Do NOT be distracted by noise, lest you be sent backward a few sentences or worse, a few paragraphs or pages. Savor the meaning of one sentence at a time. Go slow and read no more than one chapter per sitting. But keep at it. Don't stop in the middle of a chapter. You don't want to go back because you forgot where you left off. But if you start daydreaming about your job or a trip to the food court, stop.<br />Using this &quot;disciplined&quot; method of tackling &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; - by the time I got about a quarter of the way through - I started discovering TWO reasons why this book achieves excellence, albeit the kind that will forever polarize readers, and rightly so.<br />FIRST, &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; is a purposely challenging and romantic (yes it is), novel with many bloody, grimy and depressing details. It's difficult because it has none of the sentence structure with which we're accustomed. But my negative attitude began to shift when I realized the novel is written like an old museum relic, the only surviving account of thoughts from a random dead narrator from the 1860s.<br />Author Charles Frazier has accomplished the near impossible, recreating a style of historic writing that feels as Greek as reading Jane Austen or Shakespeare for the first time. Everything animal, mineral and vegetable is given character. The mood is beyond melancholy, and there's danger around every corner. Nothing feels certain.<br />SECOND, I began noticing, and not in any pretentious way, that every page in &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; had at least one or two nuggets of information made more beautiful through the eyes of a 19th century narrator ignorant of the 21st century. Stuff like:<br />&quot;All that night the aurora flamed - and (the men) vied to see - who could most convincingly render its meaning down into plain speech.&quot;<br />&quot;(Describing a mentally challenged young man): Everything he saw was (newly) minted, and thus every day was a parade of wonders.&quot;<br />&quot;(Inman as he inspects a freshly covered grave): If (there's) a world beyond the grave as (the) hymns claim, such a hole (seems) a grim and lonesome portal to it.&quot;<br />I think most who dislike &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; are rightfully reacting to its tedious historical style and unconventional structure rather than the admittedly conventional story that lurks within its pages. But I also think, because I had the same negative reaction initially, that approaching this novel with more discipline, you might come away with greater respect for Frazier's ambitious effort to take a conventional romantic story and have it &quot;re-told&quot; - 19th century style - hence feeling unconventional compared to what's found in most present day bestsellers. It just stands out.<br />I'm glad I gave it another shot.nd the grave as (the) hymns claim, such a hole (seems) a grim and lonesome portal to it.&quot;<br />I think most who dislike &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; are rightfully reacting to its tedious historical style and unconventional structure rather than the admittedly conventional story that lurks within its pages.

In my mind, \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a fine book.  Regard it as a fable of what might happen to some of us after we're dead.<br /><br />People have argued that it's too sentimental -- and riddled with more cliches than what's found in director Frank Capra's filmography.<br /><br />But its structure -- as a book -- is marvelous.  \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" moves quickly and is never dull.  I believe it's the kind of title that will never go out of print.  And yet it will forever polarize readers.<br /><br />I think it's too easy for intellectual snobs to scoff at works like \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" -- excluding or denigrating all that's mainstream and \\"popular,\\" as if the unwashed masses who made this book a success are all wrong -- and they themselves are clear-headed and right.<br /><br />Just ignore them.  \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is for you if you find thick and weighty titles a little daunting after a while.  It's the perfect \\"break,\\" a refreshing change of pace for a guy like me who's used to reading so many books that feel like work -- filled with depressing themes or mind-numbing sentences -- determined to impress critics or juries who give out prizes.<br /><br />\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" cuts through all that and gets straight to the point in fewer pages.  It's not designed to please snobby critics who are always suspicious of commercial success.  And in my view, it's mean-spirited to read reviewers accusing Mitch Albom of \\"selling out\\" -- when it's obvious that he's tapped into something that resonates and brings optimism to many people who might otherwise avoid books.<br /><br />\\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" is a great response to fashionable pessimism among wine-and-cheese intellectuals.  This book isn't Hemingway.  So what?  As I raced through its pages, I began thinking to myself, \\"gee, the content is good and the writing is solid -- why can't more books be as effortless to read like this?\\"<br /><br />Reading so many books over so many decades, I was still blind-sided by what is revealed on the last page.  (Don't cheat -- it has no text -- but it's a doozy.)  Only a person with a heart of stone will feel nothing after he or she sees that last page.<br /><br />However simplistic, I won't fault Albom for knocking out something aimed straight from his heart to mine, even if he doesn't always connect.  \\"The Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" refuses to be dismissed and its fans will always outnumber its critics.

I don't know why it took so long for me to discover this little \\"fits-in-your-coat-pocket\\" book.<br />During our first trips to Manhattan, we used all those \\"other\\" fold-out maps and guides and BOOKS, even the old-fashioned \\"gas-station\\" variety maps that unfurled like huge posters that blow away while walking between tall buildings.  Carrying those, you might as well walk around with a huge sign on your back that says, \\"tourist who's lost, please take advantage of me.\\"<br />Well, we've made about six trips to Manhattan since 9/11 alone, and this book (recently updated, hence retiring the other we used) has joined us every time.<br />It has more than just landmarks.  It identifies nearly every building, hotel and best of all, street numbers, north to south, east to west.  This is really handy when you have an address but you have no idea where so-and-so block number is (and I'm too old to use those so-called \\"easy formulas\\" locals use to figure out where the numbers start and end depending upon the intersection you stand).<br />Moreover, the subway maps are great.  Not just weekday routes, but weekend and holidays are here too.  Again, it's so much better to have a fits-in-your-hands booklet like this than even that huge subway map the MTA dishes out for free.  Even outbound trains taking you outside Manhattan and into the boroughs are featured.<br />I guess my only quibble for us visitors is how to grab a subway and train combo to get to other side of the Hudson, you know, like to Liberty State Park in New Jersey?<br />Routes to the other NYC boroughs are well and good (someday it would be great to have a map of the main streets in Queens, the Bronx and especially Brooklyn included, but please don't make the book much thicker; who wants to carry an almanac?; leave that for Frommmer's and Fodor).<br />But it'd be nice to find a map book that doesn't feel like the world stops and ends in Manhattan.  This Tauranac still serves its purpose though, and if you're ever on the island, it's near impossible to get lost.

I am astounded by two things associated with Steve Hodel's \\"Black Dahlia Avenger.\\"<br />* This is NOT just about the Black Dahlia murder. This is an absorbing and painstaking reconstruction of events associated with the murder of Elizabeth Short, as well as about a dozen other sex-related (and to date unsolved) murders of women across several years in Los Angeles.<br />* There is an amazing volume of mean-spirited venom about this book that, in my view, feels disproportionately harsh, given what author Hodel, a former homicide detective who has investigated more than 300 murders in the Los Angeles area, has accomplished. Hodel is not an amateur sleuth. His credentials are solid.<br />What's best about \\"Black Dahlia Avenger\\" is until the very end, Hodel maintains an eerily professional sense of detachment about everything he uncovers. There are no sensationalistic pronouncements (or even sensationalistic photos) - and whenever he launches into something unproven, he tells the reader up front what must remain in the realm of \\"speculation\\" - while expressing an opinion that feels like common sense.<br />Hodel writes and acts like the former homicide detective he is; and only at the end does he allow the reader a window into his emotions. Yet this is an engrossing read, accessible to all. It reads and tracks better than a fictional whodunit.<br />\\"Black Dahlia Avenger\\" is simply one of the finest true-crime books ever written. Author Hodel is so exhaustive in his research, he even devotes an entire chapter to what five decades of \\"mythology\\" associated with the Black Dahlia have done to taint our view about the crime and the victim herself.<br />Hodel explores everything: the possible nature of Elizabeth Short's relationship with his father, police corruption and payoffs, the motives behind covering up or destroying evidence, the significance of an illegal abortion ring and its relationship to the LAPD, the relationship between the police and the press, the circle of \\"friends\\" the murderer and his accomplice had, their obsession with surrealism, sexual submission, etc. - an eerily timed incest trial involving his father and half-sister, an oddly coincidental 40 years worth of self-imposed \\"exile\\" by his father that in retrospect appears related to fears linked to the Dahlia - the list goes on and on.<br />Yet best of all, Hodel does the most prudent thing any detective would do before going public. Beyond conducting an exhaustive number of interviews, he obtains \\"blind\\" handwriting analyses from a forensics expert, and to further convince himself and the reader that he's on the right track, he submits all of his data, as in a real murder investigation, to a surprised and perhaps initially skeptical deputy district attorney, Mr. Steve Kay in Los Angeles.<br />Deputy D.A. Kay, while qualifying his opinion as being his own, declares that based on evidence gathered, author Steve Hodel is correct; his father George was the prime suspect in Elizabeth Short's murder, and if alive, he would be prosecuted for this as well as for the murder of Jeanne French, which occurred a month later.<br />The negative reviews are so shrill and insultingly dismissive that they go beyond trying to diminish author Hodel's accomplishments (e.g., calling it a \\"Daddy Dearest\\" screed; I assure you this book is not). They feel like an attempt to trash Hodel, to convince you his book shouldn't be explored at all, that it doesn't belong on ANY bookshelf. Maybe some of it isn't rock solid, but Hodel is up front about what is and what isn't, and is beyond careful, using qualifers to help the reader along.<br />Some of the venom is focused on the author's discovery of two mysterious photos in his father's personal album that resemble Elizabeth Short. Some claim the woman doesn't look like the Black Dahlia at all. Well, one only needs to look at other photos of Elizabeth Short, and not just the few that appear in the book, to be convinced there is indeed a resemblance. Common sense dictates that absent a resemblance, Hodel's investigation AND his book would not have reached first base, let alone all the way to acquiring a favorable opinion from deputy D.A. Steve Kay. Perhaps in a later edition, author Hodel should include other photos of the victim, combined with opinions of renowned medical examiners, as part of his response to skeptics.  However, the photos were merely a launching point for Hodel's curiosity.  By the end of the book, the evidence gathered makes those photos superfluous.  His investigation in no way rises or falls on just two photos.<br />After many decades of reading Dahlia books, I'm finally convinced that author Hodel has come closest to presenting the best and most plausible explanation of what happened, backed by voluminous research and exhibits. Give it a chance and read it from cover-to-cover. Trust me, this one is a winner.lance.

In \\"What Liberal Media?,\\" Eric Alterman has done a lot of research to counter a three-decade old \\"thesis\\" that seems accepted by middle-America, but not by most university professors and liberals living in our biggest cities.<br />Yet I'm disturbed by Alterman's recent public appearances. They seem to create doubts about the man himself. As a former news director and reporter, and present-day media strategist by trade, I know credibility is fundamentally critical to win \\"converts.\\" But Alterman doesn't have it. A columnist in one of America's most liberal publications, \\"The Nation,\\" Alterman doesn't appear as convincing as Bernard Goldberg did, for example, at MSNBC this month, surrounded by a huge crowd of potentially hostile college students in Miami.<br />Alterman's dismissal of Bernard Goldberg's \\"Bias\\" is unconvincing. \\"Bias\\" was ground-breaking because: 1) it was written by a liberal Democrat who had insider information about his experiences with senior editors at CBS News, and, 2) it was filled with information, however anecdotal and regarded as \\"unscientific\\" by some, collected over three decades in the great city of New York.<br />Alterman trashes Goldberg. But Goldberg's arguments were plausible and not as loony-sounding as Alterman tries to make. People in newsrooms DO NOT have a hidden agenda. Liberal bias occurs naturally when you're surrounded by like-minded peers striving to be \\"politically correct.\\" Walter Cronkite is an avowed leftist. But you'd never know it if you watched him on TV. And that's how, Goldberg says, it should be.<br />Alterman's ability to win converts, as Goldberg did, will depend on reactions from people who MATTER. If only liberals buy or read this, very little will be gained. It would be nice if a conservative said, \\"you know, wait a minute, Alterman has a point.\\" That's what Goldberg did, casting seeds of doubt in liberals without ranting, which is what Alterman and Coulter do on opposite ends of the political spectrum!<br />\\"Bias\\" was a memoir of frustrations, written by a liberal who feels journalism should offer balance to viewers who \\"live between Manhattan and Malibu.\\" Goldberg torched his career in network news. Alterman, a liberal, preaches to a choir of liberals. Goldberg, a liberal, reached out to both liberals and conservatives, many who remain friends. In the end, Alterman is in the same position as Limbaugh, but less powerful; hence, his effort to win \\"converts\\" will prove futile.<br />If Alterman accomplishes half of what Goldberg's \\"Bias\\" did, then \\"What Liberal Media?\\" will have longer shelf life and relevance. This is a good start to force the ocean liner into a U-turn. But Alterman needs other voices, ironically, conservative \\"insiders\\" who agree with him, to create momentum. He's worth reading, but despite many footnotes, his book lacks the necessary firepower that made \\"Bias\\" such a compelling \\"inside\\" read. Liberals had no choice but to take Goldberg's book seriously; only the mean-spirited dismissed it as musings from a disgruntled ex-employee. Conservatives, however, may pass on \\"What Liberal Media?\\" because of its \\"absolute\\" tone. And that would be a shame.Bias\\" was a memoir of frustrations, written by a liberal who feels journalism should offer balance to viewers who \\"live between Manhattan and Malibu.\\" Goldberg torched his career in network news.

US	52655636	R3L6HCN6Y5AH9I	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	4	23	31	N	Y	Why did the "The Lovely Bones" become a mega-bestseller?	On August 14, 2002, I attended an Alice Sebold reading. As an ex-journalist, I'm a cynic. Until that day, I had only read about five novels since 1978. Most fiction involves less research and \\"rules\\" than non-fiction.<br /><br />Yet Sebold spent five years writing \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"  She didn't intend it to be a Great American Novel (awful clich&eacute;), a handbook about managing grief.  Then astoundingly, it sold more than one million copies in less than two months. Why?<br /><br />On May 8, 1981, Alice Sebold was raped, an incident that nearly destroyed her. She wrote an explicit, shocking and almost neglected book in 1999 called \\"Lucky.\\" It was this knowledge, as a non-fiction reader, and not hype or current events, that drew me to \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" You may not have to know this about Sebold. But if you do, what she writes in \\"The Lovely Bones\\" assumes credibility, even if you're shaking your head in bewilderment, having trouble believing what's in it.<br /><br />\\"Hype\\" is a fashionably pessimistic word being used with excess to leverage what in my view are elitist comments against this book. \\"Hype\\" is a product of marketing with little relevance to quality. I agree with whomever said the following: People who give into \\"hype\\" expecting a seismic shift in their lives before turning to \\"page one,\\" are doomed to disappointment. Hype doesn't give a book \\"legs.\\" Word-of-mouth does.<br /><br />Narrating from the dead, as Susie Salmon does in \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" isn't new. In the shorthand of cinema, you can quickly point to \\"Sunset Boulevard (1950) and \\"American Beauty (1999).\\" She may seem wiser beyond her \\"years,\\" but it isn't critical to separate adolescent vs. adult narration. \\"Real time\\" exists for the living. Susie's dead.<br /><br />In \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" the only thing that matters is what remains in memory. We question what we can't see, yet invisible things like oxygen, love, hate, lust, sorrow and hope are undeniable. After people die, we hear their voices, we remember their touch and the way they look. They're in the next room, watching TV, reading, whatever. Sebold captures our obsession, our \\"presence of mind\\" about the dead. This obviously resonates with people, many without the time to read 10 books per year. To denigrate fans of this book smacks of unnecessary snobbery that promotes literary \\"class distinctions.\\" Conversely, sophisticated readers raise valid criticisms that wouldn't be as intense if they read the \\"NC-17\\" horrors of \\"Lucky.\\"<br /><br />Sebold creates an atmosphere absent of shrillness or clinically described violence. A \\"quick read\\" is not synonymous with shallowness. Expressing the intangible with sentences 10-25 words in length is near impossible. But Sebold's ability to impart abstract thoughts into simple sentences can't be dismissed. This is not a murder mystery. If it was, it'd be ordinary. This is an admittedly broad-brush story about family connections that pushes the thriller into the back seat. Splitting hairs about the plausibility of character motivations misses the big picture of \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" It's not literature aspiring for greatness, filled with big words, tortuous sentences and the type of false profundities that wins awards. It's a book that achieves something greater for most writers -- a chance to weave a collection of universal themes -- through an accessible narrative that sophisticated readers as well as the greater body of people who have zero desire to read can appreciate.<br /><br />Perhaps this is why disappointed readers keep using words like \\"overrated\\" or phrases like, \\"doesn't live up to the hype.\\" They're comfortable with authors requiring more words leading toward a revelation that feels closer to irony and \\"truth\\" than uplift. Hence what's \\"familiar\\" seems trite.<br /><br />But Sebold isn't trite. We demand logical human behavior, but there's a randomness about everything that lies ahead. Wry observations bring the ordinary to the surface without, in most cases, pretentiousness. Accusations of peddling cheap sentiment ring false because she draws upon her past to conjure up spare, abstract subtext and expressions to carry her tale. She succeeds using observational symbolism without wielding a preachy sledgehammer. Looking for religious dogma in heaven? Forget it. To Susie, \\"heaven\\" is just a shorthand for where she \\"is.\\" It could be anything.<br /><br />Sebold's idea is that the dead do more than just \\"think.\\" There are reasons why they suddenly seem near, then disappear. She told ABC News that she doesn't think too much about heaven. But she obviously thinks a lot about the dead, especially victims of violence. Some complain her characters are \\"caricatures.\\" Composites of traits we've seen in friends and ourselves makes a concept less believable? Susie's \\"voice,\\" regardless of age, represents her view, however subjectively precocious, illogical or formulaic. Only one chapter goes off the tracks, proffering a scene that comes too close to \\"Ghost.\\"<br /><br />Is this a book for the ages? Maybe not. But I'm disturbed that a \\"commercial\\" success, even unexpected (as some forget this was), can be disproportionately punished with contempt in forums, unworthy of being labeled a \\"literary success.\\" If the masses like it, hype is responsible and it must be suspect, despite glowing reviews from respected critics, many with advanced degrees in English and comparative literature.<br /><br />For me, a non-fiction reader, the restrained poignancy of Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a surprise in the aftermath of her uncensored and harrowing memoir, \\"Lucky.\\" In the hands of any writer bereft of real-life misfortune, concepts about death in a fictional tale, wouldn't have worked. It's impossible for me to ignore the author's history, despite her repeated statements that a huge gulf exists between \\"Lucky\\" and \\"The Lovely Bones.\\"<br /><br />Yet the success of \\"The Lovely Bones\\" proves it doesn't matter. Thirty years from now, people will still be talking about it. I'm convinced no matter how hard Sebold tries -- the legacy created by her non-fiction \\"Lucky\\" and her fictional \\"The Lovely Bones\\" -- will remain preserved AND inextricably linked. This is why she succeeds in restating, however inadvertent, the universal message that if life is defined by only what we see, our dead remain in the past.

It attempts - and succeeds - to cover every slice of our hobby.<br />Color illustrations decorate every page, accompanied by disarmingly breezy and informative text by this husband and wife team (the former a charter popular arts historian featured weekly on PBS' most-watched television series, \\"The Antiques Roadshow\\").<br />There's a timeless quality to this product that makes one wonder if a second edition will ever be necessary.<br />Think of the most desired movie posters in the world, from \\"The Mummy\\" to \\"Tiffany's\\" to \\"King Kong.\\"  Think of the great cult favorites and hyper-popular genres, from James Bond to Hitchcock to sci-fi to film noir to Disney to foreign classics to horror to musicals to silents.

Unless someone told you, you'd never know, for example, that her world famous pinup shot -- taken on the bed by Life Magazine photographer Bob Landry -- was shot more than 60 years ago!<br /><br />The same holds true for the nearly 300 other photos that grace this book, some recaptured in all of their Technicolor glory.<br /><br />Get \\"Rita Hayworth: A Photographic Retrospective,\\" before it disappears!

Unlike many 9/11-related \\"rush-to-market\\" books, those responsible for this spectacular volume took their time, painstakingly endeavoring (my guess), over the course of more than six months, to create something \\"different,\\" that would be well-received, that would offer readers more for less, without going overboard with sentimental excess.<br />Skinner's \\"World Trade Center\\" is a welcome surprise, not only because of its conscientious attention to detail, but also because of what its creators chose to present inside, especially its illustrations, which were culled from many sources nationwide.  The result is an art-intensive product that is still comprehensive in scope about the history and cultural impact of lower Manhattan and the World Trade Center, from the 1940s to the present.<br />At first, the cover makes the book look like another \\"tribute,\\" dispensible and repetitive, a postcard-type souvenir that might ultimately find its way into the \\"remainder\\" section of any bookstore.<br />But its contents are opulent and lavish, without sacrificing content devoted to the history and controversy that led to the World Trade Center's construction and destruction.<br />At every turn, you are reminded that the Twin Towers were dismissed, if not hated by many architectural critics, bereft of the affection or warmth reserved for other New York City landmarks such as the Empire State or Chrysler Buildings.<br />Chapters are devoted to the world of lower Manhattan before, during and after the World Trade Center, as well as the effect these Towers had or didn't have on the regional and national stage.  There are humorous cultural references (and photos) associated from everything from thrill-seekers tight-roping across the towers or jumping from a parachute or climbing its mighty walls, to the buildings' numerous appearances in films such as \\"King Kong,\\" \\"Independence Day,\\" \\"Men in Black\\" and \\"Working Girl.\\"<br />Skinner's text occasionally undercuts itself with histrionic and obvious declarations (e.g., as in the introduction, referring to the 9/11 attacks as being \\"psychopathic,\\" etc.), previously expressed elsewhere, hence redundant to most readers.<br />However, when Skinner STICKS to history and restrains his subjective observations to the debate that led to the design, construction and political and economic atmosphere of the New York City of the 1960s and 1970s, the result is marvelous.  This volume is dedicated to what the World Trade Center was before and after 9/11, with keen insight on the fact, for example, that the Twin Towers never reached its goal of being a world center for \\"trade,\\" in spite of its name.  Every page is graced with illustrations more likely to be found in a coffee-table book costing more $$$.  The layout is subtle and understated, yet wonderfully creative, hence, made more dramatic.  The photos, particularly the satellite shots of lower Manhattan before and after 9/11, are all magnificent.  Three color fold-out sections enhance this volume, which are as high in quality as what you would find in a book published by National Geographic.<br />Among the greatest decisions made by the creators of this volume was to step away from excess verbiage in the final large section that records what actually happened on 9/11.  Following a well-written and understated essay, page after page of incredible color photos re-visit the day.  Simple captions, absent of editorializing, serve only as labels for readers.<br />The tremendous power and strength of this volume is enhanced, in my opinion, by the following:  Because its publishers secured permission from many news sources, the most spectacular pictures are packed into one book and properly credited.  The result -- from showing the jet slamming into the south tower, the collapse of both buildings, the facial reactions of onlookers, the rescue efforts by public safety officials, to the shot of President Bush putting a comforting hand on the back of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's head -- is despite the fact we've seen these images before, it's gratifying to find them represented in a single sturdy volume that is, perhaps by design, shaped like one of the two towers.<br />With a few nagging exceptions when unneeded editorializing creeps into the text, \\"World Trade Center\\" is a \\"straight-ahead\\" book, easy at first glance to overlook.  It's always a pleasing surprise to learn otherwise after you get past the cover.<br />In rare cases, as with \\"One Nation,\\" the wonderful volume about 9/11 by the editors of Life Magazine, there are occasions when \\"speed\\" can work, as long as journalistic principles are embraced.  Conversely, it's often said that the best things in life are those that take the longest to produce.<br />In the case of Peter Skinner's \\"World Trade Center,\\" the publishers opted to take their time.  As a result, the end product is one that zooms past other illustrated volumes about the events of 9/11, specific to New York City, hence, in my opinion, it deservedly earns a place in your permanent library.ph Giuliani's head -- is despite the fact we've seen these images before, it's gratifying to find them represented in a single sturdy volume that is, perhaps by design, shaped like one of the two towers.<br />With a few nagging exceptions when unneeded editorializing creeps into the text, \\"World Trade Center\\" is a \\"straight-ahead\\" book, easy at first glance to overlook.

After receiving a few mean-spirited e-mails about my review of this book, I feel I must clarify a few issues.<br />Again, I've gone through nearly 30 books about 9/11. After you get past the austere black cover, this paperback falls with a thud.<br />Simply put, this book tries too HARD to be profound.  You see images you've seen before, such as the sequence of shots of one of the jets slamming into the south tower of the WTC.  Nothing new.<br />Two things bug me:  Layout and content.<br />In the layout, you get the feeling the editors are trying to SLEGEHAMMER the reader with the obvious.  I hate this.  For example, in some essays, certain words and phrases are laid out into single lines, as if they are poetry.  Then there is the awful decision to use fonts of varying sizes to EMPHASIZE certain passages.  This is a pretentious device that, I'm sorry, calls TOO MUCH ATTENTION to itself.  It is completely unnecessary and smacks of a patronizing tone intended to magnify the depth and gravity of what occurred on 9/11.  We all know about that dark day.  We DON'T need it pushed into our faces under the umbrella of \\"literary art.\\"<br />Meanwhile, about the Chomsky essay:  It's short but it's awful.  It's laid out, again, in a way that feels like \\"padding.\\"  His message reads like an \\"I told you so\\" lesson.  Here's what he does:  He points to America's \\"sins\\" of the past and then turns them around in a way that makes you want to believe that it's NOW THE UNITED STATES' TURN TO SUFFER.

On October 19, 2001, my wife and I walked more than 50 blocks from downtown to mid-town Manhattan, stopping at each fire station along the way.<br />Every stop had its own story to tell, without the need for eloquent prose or a \\"tour guide\\" leading the way, stating the obvious.<br />Images of lost firefighters and burning candles were out front, with hand-scrawled tributes plastered on every available space, written by heart-broken individuals from throughout the country, and NOT just from New York.<br />Of all books attempting to capture the flavor of a well-done tribute to ANY cause or group of individuals (in this case, the Fire Department of New York, now world-renown as FDNY), \\"Brotherhood\\" succeeds wonderfully in a way that SHOULD seem obvious to most, but apparently not, especially when compared to countless other \\"rush to market\\" though \\"well-intentioned\\" tributes of similar bent.<br />\\"Brotherhood\\" follows a perfect, \\"by-the-dots\\" formula that all pure \\"tributes\\" should follow, at least in terms of composition and design. And that is, use minimal text and heart-wrenching images that speak a thousand words.<br />Too often, creative teams associated with such efforts go overboard by stating the obvious, manipulating viewer or reader emotions unnecessarily with narration, captions or adjective-filled text to articulate the intangible. The result is a product, however well-intentioned, that is undercut by an over-zealousness to stamp into words, a generic and universal feeling when none are required.<br />The cumulative effect of image after image -- of empty fire stations, burning candles, faces of those lost, notes written by children, flowers of every hue, empty boots marked by their owners -- is ultimately equal parts devastating and uplifting, without a trace of maudlin excess. Its understated presentation proves to be the best thing going for it.<br />More than any other symbol, the fire stations of New York City offer the greatest lasting visible personification of courage, its inhabitants giving no thought of what the word itself means other than something that others (you and I) have attached to that innate sense of mission that seems to course through every firefighter's veins.<br />With introductions by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (the only other major volume blessed with the Mayor's words is \\"One Nation,\\" by the editors of Life Magazine, which by itself should be enough endorsement), Fire Commissioner Thomas Van Essen and Pulitzer-prize winning author Frank McCourt -- and supplemented by wonderful text absent of cheap sentiment by Tony Hendra -- \\"Brotherhood\\" offers a stark blend of prose and spectacular images that enable the reader to conjure his or her own personal set of emotions, without being sledge-hammered into being told how to feel.<br />As a writer who prefers a mix of substance and tribute over tribute alone, I have surveyed more than 25 products associated with 9/11, and have learned AGAIN to never to judge a book by its cover or by liner notes alone.<br />To date, \\"Brotherhood\\" is one of only a small group of 9/11-related products that truly deserve to be on your permanent shelf, and one of only two pure \\"tribute books\\" worthy enough to be labeled, \\"keepers.\\"<br />The other volumes, all available ...include: \\"September 11: A Testimony (by Reuters; the second worthy \\"pure\\" tribute available), the aforementioned, \\"One Nation (by the editors of Life Magazine),\\" \\"September 11, 2001: A Record of Tragedy, Heroism, and Hope (by the editors of New York Magazine)\\" and \\"The World Trade Center (by Bill Harris).\\"<br />Save your money to buy these volumes -- and consider the rest as no more than heartfelt souvenirs and memorials -- worthy of browsing, but not buying.nification of courage, its inhabitants giving no thought of what the word itself means other than something that others (you and I) have attached to that innate sense of mission that seems to course through every firefighter's veins.<br />With introductions by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani (the only other major volume blessed with the Mayor's words is \\"One Nation,\\" by the editors of Life Magazine, which by itself should be enough endorsement), Fire Commissioner Thomas Van Essen and Pulitzer-prize winning author Frank McCourt -- and supplemented by wonderful text absent of cheap sentiment by Tony Hendra -- \\"Brotherhood\\" offers a stark blend of prose and spectacular images that enable the reader to conjure his or her own personal set of emotions, without being sledge-hammered into being told how to feel. <br />As a writer who prefers a mix of substance and tribute over tribute alone, I have surveyed more than 25 products associated with 9/11, and have learned AGAIN to never to judge a book by its cover or by liner notes alone. <br />To date, \\"Brotherhood\\" is one of only a small group of 9/11-related products that truly deserve to be on your permanent shelf, and one of only two pure \\"tribute books\\" worthy enough to be labeled, \\"keepers.\\"<br />The other volumes, all available ...include: \\"September 11: A Testimony (by Reuters; the second worthy \\"pure\\" tribute available), the aforementioned, \\"One Nation (by the editors of Life Magazine),\\" \\"September 11, 2001: A Record of Tragedy, Heroism, and Hope (by the editors of New York Magazine)\\" and \\"The World Trade Center (by Bill Harris).\\" <br />Save your money to buy these volumes -- and consider the rest as no more than heartfelt souvenirs and memorials -- worthy of browsing, but not buying.	2002-01-09

I've surveyed or browsed or reviewed about 20 items relating to the World Trade Center attacks and this is among the top three that I can recommend.<br />It's a &quot;slim volume,&quot; to borrow a cliche that book collectors use, but what's inside is an excellent illustrated history of the Twin Towers, supplemented by wonderfully chosen photographs, all laid out in sequential order, leading up to that fateful day in September.<br />Most of the other books in this &quot;category&quot; are truly &quot;tributes,&quot; filled with emotionally-laden text and images designed to pull the heart strings.  This one, despite being called a &quot;tribute,&quot; is in fact, a handy summation of history and pictures that places the Towers in their proper context.  You're moved, but you're also getting terrific information about an &quot;icon&quot; that we didn't know was an &quot;icon&quot; until it was destroyed.  It's the story about two buildings we took for granted -- criticizing and disliking them -- until they were taken from America forever.  Now the ground beneath it is sacred.<br />I'm not knocking the other &quot;tributes,&quot; but it seems that a lot of them contain too much or too little -- some have almost zero text, and those with pictures -- are just different views of the same thing.<br />There is a &quot;straight-ahead&quot; style to this book that betrays its title -- yes, it's a &quot;tribute,&quot; but it doesn't feel like a &quot;rush to market&quot; item like the others that have been offered in the last month -- just in time, in kind of a dark way, for Hanukkah or Christmas.<br />The other books I can now recommend are:  &quot;One Nation,&quot; by the editors of Life Magazine -- and &quot;September 11, 2001:  A Record of Tragedy, Heroism and Hope,&quot; by the editors of New York Magazine.  Buy these three books for your PERMANENT library and simply browse through the others at your local bookstore before you buy.	2001-12-18

Here is your 3-step solution....	As I've written elsewhere, if you can't get a ticket to this, the greatest Broadway show of all time, here's what you should do, courtesy of Amazon.com.<br />1. BUY THIS BOOK. It contains all of the lyrics, super pictures, and more important, not only the entire script, but the entire chronology, from its inception as a movie to creating the stage story to slapping together the first few songs to nervously hosting the first previews in Chicago to its blockbuster grand opening at the St. James Theater in New York! It doesn't get more comprehensive than this!<br />2. BUY THE ORIGINAL CAST ALBUM ON CD. This contains every song, from start to finish, sung by the award winning cast. The lyrics are here too.<br />3. BUY THE DVD/VIDEO, &quot;Recording The 'Producers' - A Musical Romp with Mel Brooks.&quot; This is the closest you can get to seeing the musical, albeit not on stage. And don't be fooled by the liner notes. This isn't ONLY the 85 minute version that aired on PBS, it has extra footage that clocks the package at around 1 hour and 40 minutes!<br />I saw the show in October and I'm going back to New York to see it again in March. I've NEVER been this INSANE about any entertainment product (books, films, music, staged theater) in my LIFE.<br />With all three items -- the book, the CD and the DVD/video -- you get a pretty good idea of what makes &quot;The Producers,&quot; with its spectacular mix of merriment and mirth, mayhem and satire, so great! It deserves all of its hype. You can't oversell it!<br />Every song is a show-stopper, a throwback to the riffs that feel like a &quot;best hits&quot; package from the greatest musicals ever made. A little bit of Cole Porter, Gershwin, vaudeville and classic dance melodies reminiscent of Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly (e.g., &quot;Gotta Sing-Sing!&quot; -- as in prison!), with lyrics that are so happily vulgar and irreverent that you're lucky you're not more doubled-over in pain from laughing so hard if you could only see the girls wearing pretzels on their heads and others doing the swastika &quot;circle&quot; march (visible via a tilted mirror toward the audience), done in Busby Berkeley style! Heck, there's even a bit of an homage to the Andrew Sisters (e.g., &quot;He's a Hot-sie-tot-sie Nazi!  Woo-woo, he's a hot-sie-tot-sie Nazi! Woo-woo!  The Fuhrer...is in a FUROR!&quot;)...<br />Sadly, this original cast won't be together much longer, but the traveling show officially begins next year (it'll be in San Diego from December 2002 to January 2003)! So the wait won't be as long as we thought!<br />To recap -- get the CD, the DVD/Video and THIS BOOK! Then you'll save some big-time $$$ until the show arrives in your backyard!

I couldn't wait for this book to arrive in the USA so I bought mine from Amazon.co.uk during the summer.<br />Scandal, death &amp; ashes.  The graveyard is a playground in post-Victorian England!  Yes, pretty enticing stuff.<br />But first, picture this...<br />This is a book with more than 90 chapters.  Some contain a single line of text.  All chapters present each character's point of view, all told in the first person.  Quickly you're halfway through the book.<br />Someone else once said (HBO's &quot;Six Feet Under,&quot; in fact), death makes life important.  Chevalier's wonderful third novel accomplishes, without a sledgehammer, to deliver the message that if we do what in our hearts seems right, then we can ignore the burdens of judgment from a society that demands to define what is right.<br />&quot;Falling Angels&quot; is one of the more strangely accomplished novels of the new season.  Its sullen title fools you into thinking of a Merchant-Ivory film, deftly paced with the usual examinations of class distinction and what is considered &quot;right and proper.&quot;  While this theme runs through &quot;Falling Angels,&quot; Tracy Chevalier again demonstrates her skill at research and reinventing a familiar genre.  If you didn't know, for example, how we buried our dead 100 years ago, you will here.<br />Chevalier is an atmospheric author.  She isn't into mindless murder, action, explosions or venues set in courtrooms .  She's more interested in implosions between people.  So if you're into novels of such ilk, this isn't for you.  Chevalier's last novel, the wildly popular &quot;Girl with A Pearl Earring,&quot; was loaded with atmospheric poetry, calm romance and explorations of art and religion in a narrative tempo akin to the pace of 17th century Holland.<br />But in &quot;Falling Angels,&quot; Chevalier dismisses the narrative style she used in &quot;Earring&quot; -- choosing to weave her meticulous research of graveyards, class distinction and the early 20th century suffragette movement in the United Kingdom -- into a tale of scandal, romance, death and betrayal.  Her settings include a graveyard, homes of different classes, and a destructive event in central London that hurls the reader toward a bittersweet conclusion.  That it all occurs in the aftermath of the death of Queen Victoria, who was an icon of an era steeped in moral values, magnifies the forbidden by ten-fold.<br />We follow two girls, Maude Coleman and Lavinia Waterhouse, from 1901 to 1910, as they age from 5 to 14.  But &quot;Falling Angels&quot; forces you to make observations of the adult world around them and how they are affected by events beyond their control.  Naturally as they age, they grow more confident.  And as they age, we see that while appearances mean everything to the world, only personal thoughts and hidden actions represent real truth.<br />Despite its familiar theme, &quot;Falling Angels&quot; is a book about doing what is right and morally correct versus doing what truly makes one happy.  The narrative moves forward, always in the first person, from the mouth of each major protagonist who commits his or her own brand of &quot;against the grain&quot; behavior and/or scandal.<br />&quot;Falling Angels&quot; seems to suggest that moral structure are inventions of man, the things that keep us in order.  And simply put, such inventions are not natural.  The better &quot;angels&quot; of our nature strive to do what is deemed correct, because this is the way we are &quot;brought up.&quot;  Yet the psychological, physiological and genetic codes of humans are not abstract.  They are in constant conflict with moral structure.  If we fail to recognize this, we let society cast us as &quot;failures,&quot; even if we aren't.<br />Chevalier doesn't preach, and the grisly details of the scandalous portions of her story take place mostly &quot;off camera,&quot; vividly residing in the imaginations of the reader.  I like this.  But the true masteryof &quot;Falling Angels&quot; is the abrupt change of pace that occupies the last third of her novel, a portion which carries the momentum of a locomotive.  A cast of thousands, mostly nameless, gather for a pivotal event that proves devastating.  Chevalier delivers a big &quot;set piece&quot; filled with thousands of activities going on at once -- and the surprise is -- even though they're told from different points of view, the reader is never confused.<br />This is where Chevalier has revealed a new dimension in her story-telling skills, using the narrative device of offering different points of view to best effect, moving forward with only minor cross references backward, avoiding going over old territory except to refresh the reader's memory.  This last third sets the reader up for Chevalier's &quot;home run.&quot;<br />Without giving it away, &quot;Falling Angels&quot; provides a conclusion whereby sadness and joy can co-exist.  However, Chevalier seems to suggest that what's deemed &quot;right and wrong&quot; by society can shackle us beyond death.  Sometimes, our true desires, even beyond our earthly lives, cannot be achieved except under the cloak of darkness.<br />So if it seems that most of the &quot;angels&quot; in &quot;Falling Angels&quot; fall, in fact, they all have the opportunity to rise.  And wonderfully, there is redemption better left unsaid that concludes Chevalier's story that emotionally lifts the reader, without succumbing to the maudlin &quot;Hollywood ending.&quot;  Will this redemption require help from &quot;scandalous&quot; friends and/or &quot;upstanding&quot; individuals?  And if so, what of it?<br />One comes away from &quot;Falling Angels&quot; feeling that &quot;falling&quot; in the eyes of society is just a state of mind, especially if we're the targets of harsh judgments.  We have more control of our self-worth than we think.<br />We should all be glad we don't live in 1910.  But truly, is today any different?astery of &quot;Falling Angels&quot; is the abrupt change of pace that occupies the last third of her novel, a portion which carries the momentum of a locomotive.

After a long delay, the latest volume in the Hershenson-Allen behemoth series of movie poster books, &quot;Not Nominated,&quot; is finally here.<br />This latest enterprise, in my mind, can truly be called, without apologies, a &quot;reference&quot; volume, possessing qualities consistent with what I associate to be the purest definition of what this word is supposed to mean.<br />The critical aspects are these:  Beyond printing each &quot;year&quot; on the vertical edges of each page, this volume isn't all about images.  It lists Oscar winners.  It lists every film that was nominated for Best Picture.  It illustrates, in wonderful color, posters of films that in most cases, were ROBBED of a Best Picture nomination.  But the editors keep going.  They list &quot;honorable mentions,&quot; a concession that the panelists on its selection committee (for which I was honored to be a member), did not always agree with the choices that ended up in your book.<br />I'm conceited when it comes to Oscar.  I'm a professional writer who happens to be an amateur film historian, who, in 1972, was a winner in the San Diego Union-Tribune's Academy Award history contest, having studied this subject obsessively, watching every Oscar telecast since 1962.  So it's obvious why I would disagree with my fellow panelists on a number of selections, and in such cases, why it was a lousy feeling to see some of my choices &quot;overruled&quot; and put into the &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; category, or worse, not even listed at all.  Yet the selection process was completely fair.<br />Some choices were obvious and expected, e.g., &quot;Singin' in the Rain,&quot; &quot;The Third Man,&quot; &quot;The General,&quot; &quot;Queen Christina,&quot; &quot;City Lights,&quot; &quot;Pinocchio,&quot; &quot;North by Northwest,&quot; &quot;Rear Window,&quot; &quot;Some Like it Hot,&quot; &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany's,&quot; &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; and &quot;2001.&quot;<br />But some choices were baffling.  How can anyone, for example, leave off films like &quot;The Seven Year Itch (1955),&quot; &quot;Duck Soup (1933),&quot; &quot;National Velvet (1944),&quot; &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945),&quot; &quot;Black Narcissus (1947),&quot; &quot;Key Largo (1948),&quot; &quot;The Miracle Worker (1962),&quot; &quot;Two for the Road (1967),&quot; &quot;A Man and A Woman (1966),&quot; &quot;Glory (1989),&quot; &quot;The Commitments (1992),&quot; &quot;Fearless (1993),&quot; &quot;Dead Man Walking (1995)&quot; or &quot;Three Kings (1999)?&quot;<br />And some selections, forgive me, were overrated.  What's a film like &quot;Dracula&quot; doing in there?  &quot;Frankenstein,&quot; yes, but has anyone tried to sit through &quot;Dracula&quot; in its original, un-musically scored version without unintentionally laughing?  A film that stands the test of time does so without falling back on the post of the technical limitations of any era.  Is the monetary value of the film's poster and/or its standing as an iconic title greater than the merits of good old-fashioned story telling?  Dracula is a classic, but a Best Picture nominee it wasn't, nor should it have been, any more than &quot;Blazing Saddles,&quot; despite my tremendous affection for the latter.<br />What about &quot;Journey to the Center of the Earth&quot; over &quot;Pillow Talk?&quot;  &quot;How to Murder Your Wife&quot; over &quot;The Flight of the Phoenix&quot; or even &quot;Cat Ballou?&quot;  &quot;A Funny Thing Happened to the Way to the Forum&quot; over Billy Wilder's &quot;The Fortune Cookie?&quot;  Perhaps the worst was seeing the ponderous &quot;Far From the Madding Crowd&quot; selected over Stanley Donen's underrated &quot;Two for the Road&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Jackal&quot; knocking off Bogdanovich's enchanting, &quot;Paper Moon.&quot;  And the panelists who, in apparently sufficient numbers, were responsible for putting garbage like &quot;Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls&quot; even on the &quot;Honorable Mention&quot; list deserve 50 lashes with an well-oiled, leather whip.<br />Debating cinema as art (as opposed to posters) makes for great fun, and this is why this book is worth buying and talking about.  But I was most happy with four selections in particular that were associated with the agonizing process the editors' chose to make this book historically credible.<br />The first was Ernst Lubitsch's &quot;The Shop Around the Corner (1940),&quot; that wall-to-wall Margaret Sullavan-James Stewart howler that still holds up as being done one of the greatest romantic comedy films from Hollywood's Golden Age.  The second was &quot;Say Anything (1989),&quot; writer Cameron Crowe's first directorial effort.  The third was Terence Malick's haunting &quot;Days of Heaven (1978).&quot;  But the fourth, the one that brought the most joy, was the panel's selection of David Lean's wonderful 1945-46 collaboration with Noel Coward, &quot;Brief Encounter (1946).&quot;  I can only count on one hand the number of people I know out here on the West Coast who have seen this near perfect 86-minute film.  Yes, I disagreed with some of the choices, but this particular selection confirmed that the editors did their homework in their efforts to create a credible cross section of non-Hollywood industry historians to join their &quot;jury.&quot;  I applaud them for selecting this movie despite the higher profile titles released the same year, such as &quot;Gilda,&quot; which even though was among my selections, I was only mildly disappointed to see &quot;missing the cut.&quot;  The latter is high grade &quot;B&quot; material compared to &quot;Brief Encounter.&quot;<br />Moreover, I applaud the editors for assembling one of the finest pictorial books ever published about Oscar history, featuring posters associated with films that were shamefully overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Admittedly, not all of the posters feature great art, but the point is to document history.  I hope there will be a second volume featuring the films that at least made &quot;honorable mention.&quot;  For this first volume (which no one in publishing history has ever done in terms of subject matter), panelists were limited to listing just five &quot;losing&quot; films each year.  But we know that some years it was feast or famine in terms of quality.<br />Combining great images with great history, if Hershenson and Allen continue to keep the quality as great as this, they'll be publishing forever, and not just to the narrow band of hard core movie poster collectors who DON'T make up the greater body of book buyers in America.t;Honorable Mention&quot; list deserve 50 lashes with an well-oiled, leather whip.<br />Debating cinema as art (as opposed to posters) makes for great fun, and this is why this book is worth buying and talking about.

Yes, I disagreed with some of the choices, but this particular selection confirmed that the editors did their homework in their efforts to create a credible cross section of non-Hollywood industry historians to join their &quot;jury.&quot;  I applaud them for selecting this movie despite the higher profile titles released the same year, such as &quot;Gilda,&quot; which even though was among my selections, I was only mildly disappointed to see &quot;missing the cut.&quot;  The latter is high grade &quot;B&quot; material compared to &quot;Brief Encounter.&quot;  <br />Moreover, I applaud the editors for assembling one of the finest pictorial books ever published about Oscar history, featuring posters associated with films that were shamefully overlooked by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  Admittedly, not all of the posters feature great art, but the point isto document history.  I hope there will be a second volume featuring the films that at least made &quot;honorable mention.&quot;  For this first volume (which no one in publishing history has ever done in terms of subject matter), panelists were limited to listing just five &quot;losing&quot; films each year.  But we know that some years it was feast or famine in terms of quality.  <br />Combining great images with great history, if Hershenson and Allen continue to keep the quality as great as this, they'll be publishing forever, and not just to the narrow band of hard core movie poster collectors who DON'T make up the greater body of book buyers in America.	2001-05-05

It is historical, factual and meticulous.  Yet it is not TOO detailed.<br /><br />* Unlike typical historical treatments of people whose accomplishments are regarded so magnificent that they are automatically given an entrance ticket into the pantheon of immortality, Sobel's story of Galileo and his relationship with his daughter is engrossing, spellbinding and bereft of the technical minutiae that bogs down many works of non-fiction.<br /><br />* Too often, authors attempting to bring life to the thoughts and actions of great figures, go so overboard with tiny details that they undercut their own efforts.  They disrupt the narrative momentum so critical to good old fashioned story-telling.  There's nothing worse than to read half way down a page and then realize that you missed everything crammed so badly into two paragraphs that you're forced to read them again.<br /><br />* \\"Galileo's Daughter\\" is a work of non-fiction and an easy read, despite its potentially forbidding subject.  While much verbiage is expended about the master's fight to prove Copernicus' theory of a sun-centered galaxy, in the face of recriminations and potential persecutions from the Catholic Church, the author's method of tackling this issue is unlike anything you will ever find in a boring textbook.  The result is pure entertainment, like watching a drama about a clash of ideas and egos, the stuff movies are made of.<br /><br />* After a while, you are lulled into thinking that the title of Sobel's book is merely a subtext to what is really Galileo's story.  His daughter's letters simply humanize the \\"legend\\" of Galileo, transforming him into a domestic, a real person, a parent with the normal concerns for his children.  For all of his cranial powers, Galileo is not so self-absorbed that he abrogates his responsibilities as a father.  He comes off as a concerned parent who endeavors to provide the best for his children.<br /><br />* But then the twist!

As a journalist, I can't explain my aversion to fiction, other than to say that anything akin to \\"once upon a time\\" is already six feet under to me.  Truth has always seemed stranger than fiction.<br /><br />I was attracted to this book for one reason.  I was at the Maurithuis Museum at the Hague in the Netherlands in 1996 and saw Vermeer's \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" and \\"A View of Delft\\" (both pictured on the book's dust jacket) in person.  They are the most unforgettable paintings I have ever seen.  Vermeer's paintings are incredibly hypnotic, drawing us into a time and place that no longer exists.  By virtue of thousands of brush strokes, we are pulled into a time warp which places us into a scene the same surreal way that an old photograph does.<br /><br />This is what author Tracy Chevalier has wonderfully achieved.  Unlike other paintings riddled with religious motifs, nearly all of Vermeer's 35 known works have the ability to force you to think, \\"Yes, this must have been what ordinary life in Holland was like more than 300 years ago.\\"  And one can be  quite moved by this even if one loathes cheap sentiment.<br /><br />The book's triumph is taking the tangible, that is, the painting which still resides in the Netherlands -- fusing it with what historians know about life in  17th century Holland -- and then concocting something that not only is  believable, but plausible, even though our minds are telling us, \\"But this is still a piece of fiction.\\"<br /><br />Griet, our heroine, does seems  mature beyond her years.  Yet her thoughts are not unbelievable when we remember our own youth, what scared us, moved us, what made us care about what others thought.  We felt wise beyond our years.  Only later did we discover how naive we were, how much more we had yet to learn.<br /><br />Griet's narration reads better if we imagine her telling her story from the point of view of an adult reflecting about her thoughts when she was 16, and not in the present tense, as presented here.  Still, there is a soft rhythm in her narration that doesn't seem pretentious in a way that would call attention to the author's writing style, the mortal sin of any book.  When something is good, we don't think about how words are strung together.  We are so enthralled that time loses all meaning, like a dog whose only notion of it is something nebulous that must last forever.<br /><br />The events which force Griet to work for Vermeer and the tragedy that occurs later, have less emotional impact on Griet as a 17th century girl than if she were a 21st century girl.  They are treated without sappiness.  We watch Griet's transformation as an attractive young woman who is already aware of her effect on men, to something more complex and cunning.  We listen to her efforts to de-feminize herself to deflect unwanted attention, her silly and resigned rationalizations in her trading of dispassionate \\"minor\\" sexual favors to achieve her goals, however vague they may seem.  We deduce that Griet is a creature of the moment in her actions, but oddly, in her mind, she is also a girl who has one eye on her own future, as well as her family's.<br /><br />The greatest scenes in the book are the conversations, sparse as they are.  When Vermeer tackles the complex subject of religious attitudes toward paintings and whether they have any relevance to the viewer, despite the fact that his paintings are not riddled with religious themes -- he does so with such clarity and logic -- that it has you soaring into the stratosphere, like listening to Einstein breaking down the theory of relativity into simple language that anyone can understand without being offended.<br /><br />In addition, Griet's efforts to articulate her emotional feelings about the master Vermeer are wonderfully conveyed.  She is explicit in almost every other emotion, but never about her growing romantic feelings toward Vermeer.  Yet it is clear in her narration that she loves Vermeer in her own special way.  This, to me, is what others have long said to be the essence of romance.  It is the notion of \\"what if?\\" and all that it entails, while the rest is just  \\"life as it all turned out.\\"<br /><br />The few sexual passages in this book do seem off-kilter to its mostly placid and intelligent tone.  They were necessary to illustrate Griet's awareness of her allure, as well as her low self-image, which betray her confident narrative.  But it would have been better to allude rather than to describe what seems mildly lurid.  My first thought was, \\"Well, here's the 'PG-13' portion of the book  which calls attention to itself.\\"  The placid tone Chevalier has painstakingly created is now jarring, a rant against the sufferings inflicted upon women by bestial men throughout time.<br /><br />The book's ending (without giving it away) is \\"Zhivago-esque\\" (the movie and not the Pasternak book, though purists say one should never compare apples to oranges).  It is gentle, oblique and rich with a wonderful sense of irony and closure.  It has a completeness that takes many other authors several  hundred more pages to convey.<br /><br />Turning fiction into reality, mixing facts with a creative extrapolation of how the \\"Girl with a Pearl Earring\\" came to be, is the magic all of the world's best writers desire.  Minor faults aside, Chevalier's account is brilliant enough that in my mind, Vermeer's painting is now inextricably linked to Chevalier's book.<br /><br />The girl now has a name and her name is Griet.  The result, quite eerily, is this.  After reading \\"Girl With a Pearl Earring\\" --  how can anyone look into those luminous eyes of the girl in Vermeer's painting -- in quite the same way again?	2000-04-09

If you are the least bit interested in the jaw-dropping beauty of what has become a lost art --  the exercise of drawing images associated with the advertising of a  Hollywood film -- this is the book to have.  No other genre, in my opinion,  was more dark and foreboding and in turn experienced a burst of creativity  than posters associated with the film-noir period of Hollywood, which  roughly ran from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s.

With the notable exceptions of Oliver! (1968), Cabaret (1972), Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), Tommy (1975) and Evita (1996), Hollywood has essentially turned its back on a genre that this book re-captures in all  its glory.  The images are superb, the color and quality are sublime.  Though the book is straightforward, a thread of sadness runs subconsciously  from its first to its last pages, as one ruminates about what this genre  was all about, what it could have been and why it is, for all intents and  purposes, dead except on the New York, London and Toronto stages.  From  Astaire and Rogers to Gene Kelly, Streisand and even the Beatles, it's all  covered here.  Though it seems awkward to most of today's audiences to see  a person in the middle of a scene break out into a song with no band  playing behind him on screen, this was the accepted norm and was often the  the portion of a film that had an audience soaring in their seats.  That  such a feeling has all but disappeared makes this book all the more  precious, preventing this genre from fading into the wisps of memory.  The  beautiful thing about this book is the unexpected.  Rather than delve into  the expected great musicals with the standard American images (which are  included in great detail nevertheless), this book includes artwork from  other countries, art that is more &quot;in your face&quot; and thought  provoking.  Who can forget the image used for the Polish version of the  1972 release of &quot;Cabaret?&quot;  (Joel Grey's face in the center of  four stocking legs bent into the shape of a swastika?)  This is the kind of  thing that you would never have seen printed or distributed in the U.S.,  works of art that can only be bought for thousands of dollars today at many  of America's biggest auction houses.
