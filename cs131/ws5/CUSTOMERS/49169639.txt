It wasn't your average story.  It was more of a history, that served as a background for nearly all his other stories.  Despite this, it wasn't published until after  Professor Tolkien died.  If you haven't read anything by J. R. R. Tolkien,  I would suggest The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings.  The Silmarillion is  something to read after you're already a fan.  I recall one section that's  maybe five or six pages long that was only a description of what a  particular place looked like, but some of the stories in here are great  (for example, &quot;Of Beren and Luthien&quot;).	2000-07-29
