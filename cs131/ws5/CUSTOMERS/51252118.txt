US	51252118	RQF13OTZ1FRC7	1569472343	401690791	Hokkaido Highway Blues	Books	3	4	9	N	N	Out of Tune	I think I would have liked this book better had I read it before I lived in Japan for 7 1/2 years. Then I wouldn't have nitpicked it so much. However since I did, I must say that it is the little things about this book that bothered me. I appreciated his humorous explanation of his fluency and how he dealt with it in the book, but then later in the book, it really seemed as if he believed his own bull...er...PR. I don't know Mr. Ferguson's fluency, but from his description it is close to my own, and based upon that I highly doubt that everything that he insists was said actually was. <br />The author tries very hard to pass himself off as the consummate Japan expert. That's fine, if it's true, but if it's not, it is merely annoying and distracting to catch him in an error. Just as an example, he mistakenly claims that the Northern Japan Alps are located in Tohoku. During the 4 1/2 years I lived in Nagano, I saw the Northern Japan Alps every day, and they are not anywhere near Tohoku. This would have been easier to take had Mr. Ferguson showed a bit more humility and not come across as such a know-it-all.<br />Finally, the author's dealings with women really angered and disgusted me. He laments his inability to find love, but he never really considers that he might be part of the problem. He is so in love with himself that there is no room in his heart for anyone else.<br />Having said all that, the book is better than a lot of other books that I have read in this genre. It's not Learning to Bow, but it is also not as bad as every book with &quot;Fuji&quot; in the title either.	2002-08-30

I would guess that the author had a very negative experience in Japan because there is a great deal of anger and frustration directed at a lot of people. Japanese male characters are scheming, slimy, and even sinister. Japanese females are bubble-headed bimboes. And American men who live in Japan are the worst, no better than animals, driven only by their desire to corrupt the \\"easy\\" Japanese women, and emotionally unprepared to handle \\"adult\\" western women. <br />The lead male character in the book makes a comment that he would never date a Japanese woman because he only wants to be with adults, or something like that. And the whole book is filled with characters and statements like that. I found it blatantly offensive, bordering on racist. I can speak from the experience of more than 7 years living in Japan that her characters are not an accurate representation of Japanese people. Of course there are people who fit into those categories, but no more so than in America.<br />I am sorry that Ms. Backer obviously had such a terrible time in Japan, but this novel is not a good way to deal with her frustrations. Others will read this book and assume that it is an accurate representation of the people who live in Japan. It is not. If you are looking for a much better book in this genre, I recommend either Learning to Bow, or Audrey Hepburn's Neck.	2002-08-30

This book helps a lot with the Joyo Kanji, the nearly 2000 glyphs that are mandated by the Education Ministry for basic competence. <BR><BR>This book presents the characters in the order they are introduced to Japanese school children, so there's no risk of getting a complex, obscure Kanji until you are ready for them. Each character is introduced with its possible pronunciations and meaning, just like most other Kanji dictionaries. <BR><BR>The two things that make this book unique are the detailed &quot;etymological&quot; explanations of the formation of each character, and the suggested mnemonic devices for each glyph. The mnemonics are not always useful, and often you can come up with better ones yourself, but the explanation of the formations of the characters is outstanding. By understanding how the character was formed, you learn the various elements that make up all kanji, making them easier to learn as you go along. An additional benefit is that by knowing the origins of the character, you won't be thrown off when you happen upon kanji written using the old style, which depending on where you live and what you do, may be fairly often.<BR><BR><BR>The only thing that I found disappointing about this book is that is doesn't give stroke-by-stroke instructions on writing most kanji. Granted, that would make the book a MUCH larger volume, but when faced with a 23-stroke monster, some idea of where to start writing it would be helpful. Of course, if you use a word-processor exclusively, you'll never need to know.	2001-11-15

The author claims that her status as a university professor do not make her experiences special or unique. However as someone who has been in a similiar situation and now leads a more normal life, I say that it MUST. I also found her criticism of other foreigners unfair and prone to caricaturization. While there is value in observing the \\"ugly tourists\\" and those who have \\"gone native,\\" it is also important to look inside to see if we can find any of those people inside ourselves. The author chooses not to, and comes across as somewhat elitist as a result.<BR><BR> I was confused by the author's representation of her linguistic skills. She often claims to have little language ability, but then she also claims to have complex communications with people who do not speak English. I had great difficulty justifying the two ideas, as my own experience has been that even when you think you know what is going on, you probably don't. And I speak, read and write Japanese quite well.<BR><BR> I had difficulty with her presentation of a Japanese man who has an outspoken, artistic, independent French wife as typical. I have known a few people like that, and while I'm glad they are my friends, I wouldn't dare try to pass any of them off as typical.<BR><BR> Finally, I got the feeling that the author wasn't really \\"going to\\" Japan as much as she was \\"running away\\" from America. In her book, Japan generally receives favorable treatment, while America is often criticized. The author seems to have a thinly-veiled Lafcadio Hearn complex, where she wants to replace her American identity with a Japanese one. I have lived here for quite some time, and while I enjoy many aspects of living here, I know it is impossible for an outsider like myself to ever be assimilated. I have accepted my role as a perpetual guest, and I have learned to respect and enjoy my American identity. (At least when not surrounded by Americans acting like idiots.) Not only does the author seem to want to give up her American identity, it seems like the image of her desired Japanese identity is romanticized and unrealistic. That is an unhealthy way to live and an invitation for disappointment....	2001-07-31

While David Breashears was there, and he shares his perspective on it, this book is really his autobiography, and contains so much more than just that one incident. <BR><BR> David Breashears is a rare individual in this day and age. He is an adventurer and an explorer. But even more than that, he is a remarkably honest individual. I have read many autobiographies in my life, and this is the first one I have ever read where the author made a serious attempt to document the facts of his or her life without any &quot;editorial slant.&quot; More than once Breashears points out where he was wrong without attempting to make excuses or explain it away. That kind of honest self-appraisal is rare and refreshing. And in the case of his failed marriage, it is bittersweet. Perhaps there is something about the nature of alpinists and mountaineers; at high altitude it is necessary for their very survival to view reality for what it is, rather than what they would like it to be. Some have paid a heavy price for wearing rose-colored glasses on the mountain. But I think there is also something about David Breashears that is unique, his ability to face the truth without fear or flinching. And that is what makes this book worthwhile.<BR><BR> If you have an interest in mountain-climbing or high-adventure, this book will thrill you. But even if you don't, if you admire people who can look back on their own lives without pretense, this book will move you.	2001-06-29

While the quantity of terms and the quality of the translations are good, there are two fundamental flaws with this book. <BR> 1. All the Japanese terms are written in Romaji, or alphabetic characters. While this may be adequate for those who are just learning the language, it is very limiting for advanced speakers, who are probably more likely to use the high-level expressions contained in this book. I realize that the first edition of this book was published in 1991, but would it have been too much to ask to include the Japanese? Even for a beginning user it can be quite helpful to have the Japanese text to show to a native speaker when communication breaks down. Sometimes Romaji can't cut it.<BR> 2. It's only English-Japanese. If you want to go the other way, you're pretty much out of luck.<BR> This dictionary is [inexpensive], but in this case you get what you pay for.	2001-05-14

However author Robert Whiting has provided an extensive list of notes and references in the back of the book to support his work. And the information that his book contains is frightening, and perhaps to those who are new to Japan, surprising. <BR> <BR> Corruption in Japan runs deep, and this book dives all the way to the bottom. Whiting has done a remarkable amount of research and has had amazing access to those people who really run Tokyo and by extension Japan, namely organized crime. Using a relocated New York Mafioso as his catalyst, Whiting exposes how deeply ingrained the Yakuza are, with influence extending as high as the Prime Minister's office and as far afield as the US and Indonesia.<BR>  <BR> Nicola Zapetti knew and worked with some of Japan's most powerful Yakuza, and in Japan, many argue that the Yakuza are the most powerful group of all. Yoshio Kodama, a pardoned Class-A war criminal, ultra-right wing politician and well-known Yakuza once referred to himself as &quot;the worlds richest fascist.&quot; LDP kingmaker Shin Kanemaru was found with millions of dollars in cash, bearer bonds and gold boullion in his house, much of it bribes from the Yakuza.<BR><BR> New Prime Minister Koizumi has been labelled a &quot;reformer&quot; by the media in the West. Those who have read Whiting's book know enough to doubt both his sincerity and his chances of legitimate success at changing this system which is corrupt at its very core.<BR><BR> If you want to understand the Japan that they don't teach you about in Polical Science and Business classes, you need this book.	2001-05-14

Considering the subject of this book is Japan, that's probably not the best way to go about things. Many of the Japanese words introduced in this book are written as they would be transcribed in French, not English, leading to possible confusion. In addition, the translation is at times not very good. The text gets quite clunky and seems poorly organized in places. The one thing this book has going for it is the abundance of high quality photographs. Visually, this book is stunning, filled with lots of slick, high-gloss images. So buy this book for the pictures, but if you're actually going to read it, beware the information. There are many other books that are much better.	2001-04-16

While this book does have some pretty salty expressions, it has a great deal more depth than that, including expressions you might actually use. Also, many slang dictionaries are out-of-date before they hit the shelves. Being able to say the equivalent of &quot;I'm a hep cat, daddy-o&quot; in Japanese may have some humorous value, but in the grand scheme of understanding what is being said around you, it's not very useful. So this book has chosen to be quite conservative in the slang and colloquial expressions it uses. As a result, more than 80 percent of the expressions introduced in the book can be used today. It's a good first step out of the textbook and into the real world.	2001-02-16

The dictionary does not contain every ingredient, utensil and dish that may be found in Japanese cuisine, but it makes a valiant attempt to do so. Entries are listed with a romanized pronunciation as well as the Japanese characters, sometimes with several variations of how to write the same term. In addition the excellent appendices explain in detail how such staples of the Japanese kitchen, such as shoyu and katsuobushi, are made and used. An invaluable reference for anyone who does not read Japanese at native-level fluency.	2001-01-30

Like much of the rest of the Power Japanese series, this book does a good job of introducing vocabulary that you may not find in other sources. However the vocabulary is so high level that beginning and intermediate learners will have a hard time memorizing it and using it in conversations. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the book covers such a wide variety of specialized fields that the terms may be inadequate for an advanced learner. Advanced learners may be better served by reading books written for Japanese people about a particular subject. If you find books written for adults too difficult, books written for children and teens may be helpful. Beginning and intermediate learners might impress some people by reading sentences out of this book, but you'll probably never use a lot of this vocabulary, and hence will probably forget it. There are better books to spend your money on.	2001-01-30

As other reviewers have stated, the humor in this book is often lost on Japanese people, but if you've ever lived here, you'll probably laugh yourself to tears by the middle of the book. I use the author's explanation on why few people travel to Japan for tourism often, and it always gets laughs.  <br />Be very careful about using the Japanese in this book, as some of the phrases are quite offensive. Still, this is a good antidote when you've read too many boring phrasebooks, or you've had a nasty bout of culture shock.	2001-01-30

This book introduces 101 of the basics in a comprehensive, but easy to understand, way. Each expression is explained with a full page of text that includes an sample usage and also a full page illustration that often helps you to understand and remember the expression. For more advanced learners, I recommend checking the Power Japanese series for appropriate titles (there are several). If you're like me, you'll appreciate that this book allows you to express concepts in a way that native speakers will understand. Once you can seamlessly integrate these expressions into your everyday speech, you will be well on your way to fluency.	2001-01-30

McConnell has written the first comprehensive academic overview of the JET program. But although this book is written primarily from an academic perspective, it has enough human stories and anectdotes to keep a casual reader interested. This book lays out every aspect of the JET program, both from the viewpoints of participants and administrators. The Japanese government should buy these books for all new participants so that they know what JET is and how it works before they arrive. Knowing what to expect would smooth the transition of new JETs tremendously, and would probably reduce the number of JETs who bail out before their first year is finished. If you are already in JET and haven't learned everything about the program yet, this will help fill in the blanks. If you were a JET, this book will bring back lots of memories, hopefully all good.	2001-01-22

The culture shock, the unbending bureaucracy, the complex and often disaffected attitudes of students, the instant celebrity and lack of privacy that goes with it, are all symptoms that JETs experience. I read the book and often found myself nodding in agreement, having experience the same events and feelings myself. If you want to have an intimate look at the world of education in Japan today, Feiler's book is an excellent place to start. If you are thinking about joining the JET program, this book is a must, along with Importing Diversity.	2001-01-22

This book is almost universally considered to be among the most important works of Japanese literature of all time. But don't let that turn you away from this book. It's not biographical, but considering that Soseki lived and worked in conditions he wrote about, the story has a sense of reality and understanding that others often lack. Soseki's main character is the ultimate embodiment of the &quot;ugly outsider.&quot; As a member of urban high society, his sophisticated sensitivities are constantly assaulted by the coarse nature of the rural lifestyle and people that surround him. An effectual foreigner, he is constantly reminded that he is a fish out of water, often in a humorous way. A highly recommended book if you are planning on living and working in Japan, or to anyone who is feeling like an outsider. You may find a kindred spirit, as well as inspiration to reevaluate your situation.	2001-01-22

Pitchers pitch &quot;until their arms fall off.&quot; Fielding practice is done until players drop from exhaustion. Fans chant highly organized and rhythmic chants at the same piercing volume, all game long, regardless of the score. It's not &quot;play ball&quot; in Japan, it's &quot;work ball.&quot; And into this arena come the foreigners. Often bench-warmers and minor leaguers in North America, they are expected to become instant stars in Japan. The pressure and the intense work ethic drive many away after only a few weeks or months. Others, like Randy Bass, become national heroes, appearing on TV commercials nightly. However even Bass must have felt his outsider status when he was intentionally walked for the rest of the season when he challenged Sadaharu Oh's single-season home run record. If you are interested in baseball, or in what happens when Japan meets the outside world, this is the book for you.	2001-01-22

Japan's culture is very different from so-called &quot;Western&quot; culture, and in addition, Japanese culture is less prepared to handle non-conformists. As a non-Japanese, you are afforded a bit more leeway, but by reading this book, you will have a better idea of what to expect, and can act accordingly.

While this book has a wry sense of humor and fantastic events occur all the time, it still has a ring of plausability to it. Things may not happen in the real Japan the way Brown describes them, but if you have lived here for a while, you certainly can imagine that they might.  The characters are brilliantly developed. Your first impression is of a cardboard-cutout stereotype, but as the novel progresses, each reveals personal quirks and characteristics that give them depth and make them interesting. The range of feelings the book covers are fantastic, going from slapstick to poignancy and everything in between.  Some people talk about &quot;Memoirs of a Geisha&quot; as *the* novel to understand Japan, but even though it is excellent, it describes a Japan that no longer exists. The Japan in Audrey Hepburn's Neck is alive now, and it shows no signs of disappearing. If you want to know about the modern Japan, and be highly entertained while doing it, this is the book.	2001-01-15

It presents a side of Japan that is almost unheard of, the disenfranchised. Told as a series of first-person vignettes, with each person similar but distinct. This is the raw underbelly of Japan, violent, disatisfied with life, desperately seeking for an unknown goal. A quick look at the domestic Japanese news reveals that there is a serious crisis of identity occuring, and this is one of the few books that reveals the true roots of the problem. In my time in Japan, I have known people like the characters in this book, and in general the stories ring true. The only thing which prevents me from giving this book 5 stars is that the few places that the Japanese language is used in this book, it is odd or even incorrect. Still, the stories seem to provide an accurate insight into the thinking and lifestyles of many young Japanese.	2000-12-12

The author states as much in the introduction. Having said that, the book is very good at what it attempts to do, namely give novice readers a basic understanding of the key elements of Japanese popular culture in the post-War era. A book which covered every fad, popular music group, TV program and movie during that time period would be larger than several phone books and would have a hard time selling. What this book does well is describe, in a fair amount of detail, the important cultural icons, from Misora Hibari and Sazae-san, through Pink Lady and Doraemon, ending with SMAP and Sailor Moon. If you're looking for a primer on Japanese pop culture over the last 50 years, this is the book. If you already have deep personal knowledge or are interested in only one thing (like anime), you may be disappointed.  One other small problem with the book is that because it is in print form, the information is fixed in time, but Japanese culture goes on. In other words, some of the stuff in this book is dated. The concept of the book might better be served by a web site, but I doubt that Mr. Schilling could make a profit with such a site. If anybody decides to try though, please let me know.  I'd visit!	2000-12-12

She has become noted for her knowledge of traditional Japanese culture, and this book is an excellent example of the author's deep knowledge of the subject. In great detail, accompanied by simple but clear illustrations, she explains things that were once common, but are rapidly disappearing. One of the most interesting segments for me was the section on traditional thatched-roof houses. They are plentiful in Nagano, where I live, but I didn't imagine that any were left in Tokyo. Not only does the author interview a person that makes thatched roofs, but she gives an interesting and detailed account of life in a thatched roof home, both from point of view of the older generation who can't imagine anything else, and the younger generation who aren't as enthusiastic. Like all other developed nations, Japan's traditional crafts are rapidly disappearing, as young people become accustomed to convenience and expediency. Kiritani has preserved, in text form at least, an important part of Tokyo's and Japan's cultural history.	2000-12-11

At times, this book smacks of outright prejudice, particularly the parts about Quakers.<BR><BR> This book tries to pass itself off as a serious and probing investigation of the Japanese imperial family and US influence in Japan from Meiji through the post-war period...If you're interested in the Japanese imperial family, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan by Herbert Bix is an infinitely better way to spend your money. That book won a Pulitzer Prize...	2000-08-18

In addition, it's written with a sense of humor and a down to earth attitude that makes it very enjoyable to read.  If you've never been  snorkeling before, the first chapter will &quot;get your feet wet.&quot;   If you're an experienced snorkeler or diver, the descriptions and maps will  help you maximize your time on Maui.  The only thing that prevents me from  giving it 5 stars is that some of the maps contain small inaccuracies.   Nothing that you can't figure out when you're there, but a little  disconcerting.  Still, an extremely helpful book.  If you like snorkeling,  and are going to Maui, you need this one!	1999-12-28

All of the worst stereotypes of &quot;western men&quot; living in Japan are dragged out here and presented as fact. Other groups receive a good dose of vitriol as well, but the basic message of the book seems to be  &quot;Western men - culturally hegemonic barbarians who take whatever they  want and respect nothing, Japanese women - naive, but scheming, floosies  who want to snag a western man, but haven't really considered the  repercussions, Western women - forgotten and maligned &quot;real  women&quot; who are just too independent and mature for Western men to  handle, and Japanese men, the misundersood 'diamonds in the rough,' who  when given a proper chance, can far outshine their Western counterparts.   In short, gross stereotyping and rampant male-bashing.  It is unfortunate  that Ma chose to write this book in this way, as there are a lot of  Japanese-Western relationships that could have benefitted from accurate,  complete information, and useful advice. The main message that I found in  this book was that Japanese woman - Western man relationships are destined  to fail because both sides are immature, unrealistic, selfish and  superficial.  The secondary message seemed to be that Japanese man -  Western woman relationships were always mature, realistic, unselfish and  very real.  What claptrap!  Don't waste your money!  I hope eventually  someone writes a good book on this subject, as this one definitely isn't.	1999-11-04

This book is a  must for any westerner living in Japan, or planning to do so.	1999-07-23
