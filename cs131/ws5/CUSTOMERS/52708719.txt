The problem is that his imagination is limited.  After the umpteenth pirate attack on the main character's ship, the rape and murder of his friends and family begins to become laughable.  \\"Oh, another pirate attack, whoop dee doo!\\" you might think once you reach the mid point of the book.<br />Anthony also puts in frequent rationalizations for pedophilia, incest, rape, and murder.  My problem is not specifically that I disagree with his ideas but rather the clumsiness with which he presents them.  The lover of the main character tells him the story of her childhood when she was a prostitute but makes it clear that the man with whom she slept until age ten was a good man, just different.  If, perhaps, that character had been a part of the book and shown the reader that he was a good man, it would have been okay.  Instead, Anthony violates the fundmental \\"show, don't tell\\" rule of fiction.<br />If you can forgive all that, the writing style is simplistic.  While reading the book, I hoped it was intentionally written simplistically to reflect the fact that the supposed author of the narrative is fifteen.  However, the later books continue in the same style.  If the book had otherwise been enjoyable, this would be a minor point, but given that the content of the book is unappealing, the lacking in style is damning.	2004-01-20

Sex in books is fine and sex between main characters often serves to show the reader something important about them.  In this book, Anthony sets up political situations that can only be solved by sex, such as the loophole that marrying another officer in the Jupiter Navy allows you to bring that officer into your unit, or raping a pirate girl allows you to claim her for your own.  As in volume one of the series, Refugee, the sex is handled obviously and clumsily.<br />Little improvement is made on the style of the book over that found in Refugee.  The greatest benefit to this book's story is that it is not a seemingly endless stream of pirate attacks.  There is a good variety of events in this book, some of which are quite memorable, such as the songs sung by migrant workers or the comparison of space battle tactics to those of ancient Europeans.  Still, the overall writing style seems simplistic and of course the gratuitous sexual content makes the otherwise interesting parts less palatable.	2004-01-20
US	52708719	R84MB1UWZQV07	0345457684	556713066	Altered Carbon (Takeshi Kovacs)	Books	3	5	8	N	N	Interesting but flawed	As a fan of both hard boiled crime stories and cyberpunk scifi, this book sounded like it would be my ideal.  Unfortunately, it mixes those genres but does not succeed in them.<br />The book's biggest failure is the lack of common sense applied to the premise.  In this world, any mind can be put in any body, and in fact the protagonist was born Japanese but inhabits a hispanic body throughout the book.  This concept is throught provoking but I felt it was mishandled by Morgan.  For instance, prison terms are served by putting a person's mind in storage while the body is given to someone else to use.  Since the mind has no consciousness, this amounts to punishment by time travel.  Also, characters constantly flip flop as to whether they associate their identity with their bodies or not.  At one point someone will say &quot;all bodies are the same&quot; and at another he will lament not having his original body.  This cognitive dissonance could have been an interesting concept to explore but it seem the book doesn't take the idea too seriously.<br />The writing is also workmanlike.  Morgan indulges himself is boring, cliched dream sequences throughout the book.  His attempts to imitate the classic hard boiled allegories manage to seem out of place primarily because they occur too infrequently.  That being said, the pacing is quite good and the book is a page turner.  Thought the story was ultimately overblown, I did manage to care enough to finish the book.<br />I think Morgan shows promise.  For his next book, he could use a better editor to reel in some of his sillier ideas.  But I will keep an eye on his work in the future.	2003-11-19

I've enjoyed the new 3rd edition D&D rules and this book uses the same basic concepts to let you play in the modern world.  I think the rules work well for the modern world whether you decide to run a fantasy campaign or a mundane spy campaign.  The book is also attractive and well laid out, unlike the new D&D books.<br />The biggest difference between D&D and D20 Modern is the attitude towards classes.  In D&D, your class is what you are: a wizard, a barbarian, a cleric.  In D20 Modern, a class just adds something to your character.  The basic classes are Strong, Fast, Tough, Smart, Dedicated, and Charismatic.  Each gives you abilities in line with one of the basic ability scores.  You are not only free to mix different classes, but encouraged to do so.  The addition of advanced classes like Soldier or Techie adds another layer of customization.<br />The other modern concepts are handled well.  Guns do decent damage but not vastly more than the weapons found in D&D.  This is tempered by the massive damage rule which states that any time you receive damage equal to or greater than your constitution score you must make a fortitude save or be reduced to -1 hit points instantly.  Similarly, driving vehicles is handled much like character movement, with associated feats and skills to allow you to be a more effective driver or pilot.  Finally, the vagaries of modern finance are abstracted away with an elegant wealth system.<br />If you're looking to move players who are familiar with D&D into a modern setting, this book is definitely the one for you.  If you just want an RPG system that allows heroic modern scenarios, again this is the system to get.  The D20 system allows you to take advantage of a wide variety of D20 compatible supplements as well.<br />Overall, I think this is a great system and a great purchase.	2003-04-15

Watchmen is it's own self contained story chronicling a world much like ours where heroes, super or otherwise, exist.  It's also an analysis of where the archetypal figures in all other comics originate.  He explores each character's past and how they came to be who they are today.  He also explores the common themes of comics: good vs. evil, the end of the world, the contrivance.  He's created a story that not only entertains but also teaches.	2003-02-10

But this book lives up to the high standards set by Meyers' work.  It uses a similar itemized style to present information in easily digestible chunks.  Each item is useful in it's own right, filled with insights from a veteran Java programmer.<br />The best thing about the book is the concrete examples Bloch provides from the Java APIs.  He is honest about where they went right and where they went wrong.  The only thing I can find wrong with the book is the chapters on threads and synchronization as I don't use those features of Java these days.  But when I do, I'm sure I'll be happy to have them.	2001-11-09

Both of those books offer many concrete suggestions on how to improve your C++ coding and do things you didn't think you could do.  Effective STL, on the other hand, offers mainly suggestions of what not to do.  You'll find most of the items tell you that you should not use a specific technique because it is not portable, not a clean design, or simply because it will not work.<br />All of this is good to know, but I didn't find it as useful as his other two Effective books.  Other than the use of the built in looping functions like for_each the book didn't really provide me with many new &quot;tricks&quot; for my &quot;bag.&quot;<br />However, all the information in the book is useful, and the intermediate level STL programmer will probably learn a lot of ways to avoid problems by reading this book.  Hopefully there will be a second edition in the future that will give the book a little more utility.	2001-10-09

The first half of the book detailing the metamorphasis of Europe is interesting and exciting but the second half where you discover the cause of the change is less interesting.  I liked the adventurousness of the first half, but I found the second half to be plodding in some places.<br />Still, Wilson is a great author and this book is better than most of the science fiction being published today.	2001-07-16

The information in this book will make you twice the programmer you are now if you work in any object oriented language.  Fowler presents clear and simple ways to take existing code and make them more succinct, modifiable, and comprehensible.  He presents extensive code examples that are long enough for you to understand what's happening but not so long that you lose your place in them.<br />The book uses Java as it's language of choice but in most cases this is not a problem.  I can only recall a couple of the many refactorings presented in this book where specific focus on Java's way of doing things might obscure the message.  If you know C++ or Java you will have no difficulty understanding this book.<br />For the last few months I've been using refactoring in my programming, but until I got this book I didn't have a clear set of steps for many of the refactorings I was doing.  Having a refactoring library I can refer back to while programming is the real value of this book.  I expect to keep it nearby whenever I program.	2001-07-16

Like another reader I picked this one up in the bargain bin because it seemed interesting based on the inside cover.  I actually enjoyed the book quite a bit; as a computer scientist I was surprised how few mistakes Harry made in his descriptions of modern and near future computing.  There were a few errors, usually in terms of scale, like some of the things depicted in the book would take a lot more computing power than he says they have.  Overall, though, I would say it's the best description of current technology by a layman I've read.<br />As to the story, it mostly consisted of the main character going from place to place and learning about new technology.  The constant revelations kept me interested, but by the end things had been built up so much that I was disappointed with the story's climax.  I also felt the ending was a bit too formulaic for an otherwise different book.<br />Overall, it's a fun book and one that will probably open your eyes if you don't follow the major developments in technology.  If you can get it for a buck or two in the bargain bin I would reccomend giving it a try.	2000-12-28
US	52708719	R3LIRHGF55B88A	038080896X	752277523	Killer on the Road	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Not do different from Ellroy's other work.	Reading the other reviews here I've noticed two trends:<br />1) People say serial killers are really like the character in this book.<br />2) This book's plot os not as intricate as those found in other Ellroy books.<br />I can agree with 2 but I've never been inside the mind of a serial killer so I can't vouch for 1.  However, I have to say that I found Pluncket a believable serial killer, and to me, that's all that matters.  I don't really believe that all serial killers must fit into a certian profile; there are many unsolved murders in the world that are probably the world of serial killers who do not.<br />I found this book to be as interesting as other Ellroy books because of the intense focus on a single character as compared to looks at a number of characters that are not as detailed.  I personally enjoy the characterizations in Ellroy's books more than the plots, although I do appreciate both.  So this book was a treat for me.<br />I have to agree with some other reviewers, though, that the end of the book was less satisfying than the beginning.  Using the &quot;end at the beginning&quot; format did not impress me, nor did some of the final moments of the book.<br />Despite a few small complaints and some dissimilarity to Ellroy's other work, I would reccomend this book to any Ellroy fan or to those interested in intense characterizations.	2000-10-06
US	52708719	R1ISE23VVPDNEJ	0679441859	963527230	My Dark Places	Books	5	5	5	N	N	An amazing book.  Essential for all Ellroy fans.	My Dark Places chronicles James Ellroy's life and his search for his mother's murderer.  It gives the reader an amazing amount of insight into the mind of one of the most important living writers.  You can see the seeds of much of Ellroy's work here, especially Killer on the Road.  If you want to understand Ellroy's work and his perspective, this is essential reading.<br />However, the book stands very well on its own.  Despite what some of the other reviews have said, I found myself fascinated by every element of the book including Ellroy's detailed descriptions of his young and his exposition of Stoner's past cases.  One of Ellroy's best virtues in fiction is that all of his characters seems alive and vibrant if not honorable.  In this book he shows the same skill in describing real people, allowing you to see into the souls of Ellroy and Stoner and understand to some degree what each man has been through.<br />Ellroy's descriptions of his troubles and the cases Stoner was involved in only serve to reinforce one of the prime themes of his fiction, that of the world as a corrupt place.  Certainly there are good people, there are innocents, but for every one of them there is someone corrupt qand capable of things the innocents would never consider.  He demonstrates the struggle that each person must go through to live in this world as he did in many of his novels, such as American Tabloid, Brown's Requiem, and Killer on the Road.<br />Ultimately, this book serves many purposes.  Read as an autobiography, it reveals much about what drives Ellroy to write the books that he writes.  Read for pure titilation it offers sex, violence, and drugs although classical music takes the place of rock and roll.  It can also be read as an analysis of man's essential character, and an examination of the human condition.  All in all, this is a monumental work.	2000-10-06

Having read Expiration Date and Earthquake Weather, I expected Anubis  Gates to be as good as those two.  I had also heard from a few different  people that it was Powers' bets book.  So perhaps that is why I wasn't as  happy with it as his other books.<br />The thing that initially turned me off  about the book were the two groups of beggars in London.  They seemed  entirely unrealistic, and I had come to think of Powers as a writer that  can do fantasy that is plausible in the real world.  However, many aspects  of this book seemed implausible to me.<br />I did like his spin on time  travel, however.  Its nice to read a book featuring time travel that isn't  all about going back and fixing things.  That was a positive aspect.<br />All  in all I thought this was a decent book.  I may have enjoyed it more if I  didn't have such high expectations for it.  If you've never read Powers,  you'll probably enjoy it immensely, because it does have his characteristic  depth and imagination.	2000-08-18

It provides a detailed history of all the Crusades as well as the Templar's part in each of them.  What I found most interesting in the book were all the political details.  It becomes  apparent at many points that if the Christian invaders of the Middle East  had been organized together rather than engaging in constant infighting  they would have been able to hold onto their teritory much  longer.<br />Another nice feature of the book is the amount of time spent on  the original inhabitants of the Middle East and later in the book on the  Mongol invaders.  The author does not evince any sort of bias and treat  each group equally in his assessment, pointing out both their honorable and  despicable deeds.<br />I would reccomend this book to anyone who is interested  in history, warfare, or secret societies, although the secret society  aspect it downplayed here.	2000-07-15

The primary difference is that the holograms in Dream Park  have no substance, so to create an illusion of reality real world actors  and objects are used along with the holograms.<br />Its an interesting concept  and isn't a rip off of Star Trek at all because the book was written before  The Next Generation series ever aired.  Perhaps TNG got the idea for the  holodeck from this book!<br />Along with &quot;rides&quot; where people are  presented with various holographic images of fantastic worlds and  environements, the Dream Park features Games.  The games are essentially  role playing games where a bunch of individuals come together to act as  magicians, warriors, etc in a fictional holographic environment run by a  game master.<br />My main problem with the book is that it tries to do too  much.  Along with the plot of a group of people role playing in the game,  there is also a murder which makes the book into a mystery.  There's also  an exploration of the characters which is quite interesting, but it gets  tedious when you start to notice most of the character interaction is just  people going off to have sex.  Although there's nothing graphic, there's a  lot more sex than is called for in this book.  I'm not a prude but I felt  that the sex really didn't add much to the book.<br />Overall the book was  pretty good.  The Cargo Cult which formed the basis of the game is a real  entity and was carefully researched by the authors.  I'd reccomend anyone  who likes role playing to give the book a try, but don't expect to be  amazed.	2000-07-15

I have to say that the pacing was excellent and that it is a fun adventure book.  However, the characterizations are overwhelmingly absurd.  Ever character in the book is  a ridiculous aberation.  One or two peculiar characters in a book, I can  tolerate, but when every character in a book is either bizare or a lunatic,  credibility starts to stretch.  The gimmick of using Arthur Conan Doyle as  one of the main characters was also quite annoying to me, because the book  could easily have been done without this.  I did finish the book, but I was  pretty unsatisfied, and I'll probably be ditching it at the used bookstore  sometime soon.	2000-04-29

It takes a little while to get going, about 100 pages, but after that you won't be able to put it down.<br />Apparently, many of the  other readers here were greatly affected by the book.  It really is a  wonderful story.  I have a very low tolerance for preachiness and false  niceness which is all too common in popular novels.  However, the words and  ideas in this book ring true.  The experiences seem very real, not created  by the author simply to force his views on life on us.<br />If I had any  criticism of the book, its that I wish he had explored the boundaries of  the replay condition more fully.  But its still a wonderful book and I'm  sure in ten years I'll remember its message while forgetting any quibbles I  have about it.	2000-04-29

It covers an interesting twist on scifi: what if there weren't lots of &quot;M Class&quot; planets out there where humans could casually show up and start colonizing?  What if other planets had organisms completely toxic to  humanity?<br />Like Darwinia, around the middle of the book you start to  realize there's a much larger conspiracy going on, but unlike Darwinia, the  two halves flow together easily.<br />There was a lot of emotional intensity  in this book, and it had a very satisfying ending.  I thouroughly enjoyed  it.	2000-04-29

It is an excellent primer on how to design reusable classes in C++.  It discusses a number of aspects of  programming we tend to ignore, like the difference between logical and  physical design.  Anyone who wishes to write reusable, stable software in  C++ should read this book.<br />I have one criticism, though, and that is that  I believe the book is poorly organized.  Although each individual peice of  information in the book is useful and well thought out, I found that I  wished he would cover things in a more natural order.  Often I would read  something and have to go back and reconcile it with what had been said  earlier in the book, which was sometimes difficult.  Don't let this  criticism stop you from reading, however.	2000-04-14

The thing that struck me most about this book is how much it reminded me of how my friends and I used to write in High School.  We'd have some topic to go over, usually one we didn't care about, and we'd just put out any old  thing to just get credit.  The Meaning of Star Trek almost seems like  that.<br />The biggest problem that I have with the book is that it is so  selective in terms of the material it looks at when attempting to prove a  point.  On the whole, I believe the author discusses about ten to fifteen  episodes in depth, and mentions another 10-15.  This is from a series of  shows that have literally hundreds of episodes to choose from.  He just  selects the episodes that let him prove his point and ignores all the rest,  even if they do not agree with the point he is making.<br />He does put a  perspective on the Star Trek universe that was new and different from my  own thought and what I've read in other books, but his perspective is very  biased.  It almost seems like he decided beforehand that he wanted to say  some things were true of Star Trek and then only focused on those episodes  that would specifically prove his point, rather than examining the serieses  in detail and drawing conclusions based on the whole picture.	1999-11-24

I really can't add a whole lot to what has been said by prior reviewers.  I think that they pretty much nailed it on the head.  But here's my take anyway.<br />The first 1/3 of the book is excellent and a must read.  As  mentioned before, the list of logical errors and fallacies is great food  for thought.<br />The second 1/3 is still very interesting, although Shermer  doesn't really back up his claims about the feedback loop concept which he  uses to describe cult accusations.  Unfortunately, this book doesn't  provide enough information to prove his hypotheses, and although it has an  extensive bibliography, I don't have the time to read all these other  books.<br />The final 1/3 of the book, on creation and the holocaust, is  really the worst.  The creation section is readable, but he spends too much  time complaining about the creationists methods and not enough analysing  why they believe what they do.  The holocaust section is really the worst.   His arguments are really not convincing.  They are basically,  &quot;Everyone knows the Holocaust happened so, the deniers are  wrong.&quot;  I actually do believe it happened, but I don't think that  Shermer could have convinced me if I did not.<br />Basically, the book is a  fun read, its well written and often humorous, but I think Shermer gets a  little too carried away on some subjects.  I would reccomend it to anyone,  with the caveat that the end is a tad boring and unbeleivable.	1999-11-02

I remember reading this back in my grade school days right after it came out.  At that time I read all three books in quick succesion and loved them.  Thinking about all the fond memories I had about the books, I  decided to reread the series and see how they fared on a second  perusal.<br />Tantras is easily the worst book in the series. Unlike the first  book, Shadowdale, it does not go to any lengths to develop the chracters;  instead it uses the setup provided in the first book and does not deviate  from it.<br />I was very annoyed at a trial that occured early in the book.  I  felt that the characters acted very inconsistently and that there was some  pretty poor writing there.<br />The character of Cyric, who was quite  interesting in the first book, becomes little more than a sound bite here.   He becomes one dimensional, and doesn't get any better as the books move  on.<br />I would suggest that you slog through this one only so that you can  read Waterdeep, which is a good book.  My might just want to stop at  Shadowdale, though, because that was the best book in the series.	1999-11-02

I remember getting this when it came out about four or five years after the Avatar trilogy.  I started to read it but couldn't get into it, and its been resting on my shelf since.  Recently, I decided to reread the Avatar  trilogy because it was my favorite of the ADnD series I used to read when I  was younger.<br />Unfortunately, the Avatar trilogy did not fare as well with  time as I had hoped.  It was in no way bad after ten years, but it didn't  live up to the high regard I had for it when I read it the second  time.<br />Prince of Lies, on the other hand, was a great deal of fun.  I  started reading it right after finishing Waterdeep and it kept me  interested until the end.  The political intruiges of the gods as well as  the battles and the extreme characters all made it quite interesting.<br />I'd  reccomend this to anyone who has read the Avatar trilogy.  If you haven't,  though, you might not be as interested in some of the characters.	1999-10-23

I remember reading this back in my grade school days right after it came out.  At that time I read all three books in quick succesion and loved them.  Thinking about all the fond memories I had about the books, I  decided to reread the series and see how they fared on a second  perusal.<br />In the end, I found Shadowdale to be the best book of the three.   It had a lot of action, a grand adventure, and good character development.   Unfortunately, this book is much better than the other two.  They pretty  much stop the character development and focus more on carrying out  predictable stories based on the excellent foundation created in the first  book.	1999-10-23

I remember reading this back in my grade school days right after it came out.  At that time I read all three books in quick succesion and loved them.  Thinking about all the fond memories I had about the books, I  decided to reread the series and see how they fared on a second  perusal.<br />My opinion of Waterdeep is that it is not as good as Shadowdale,  but significantly better than Tantras.  Its a solid conclusion to the book,  and if no one has ruined it for you, the ending will blow you away.  I was  completely wowed when I read the book for the first time about ten years  ago, but this time much of the effect had been lost.<br />Like Tantras,  there's really no character development in this book.  Everyone pretty much  follows the path that was set for them in the first two books.  There are  some nice moments, and some great battles.  And an annoying and pointless  scene involving Kelemvor and a crow.<br />If you got past Tantras, you owe it  to yourself to read this one.  Its a solid conclusion to the trilogy, and  the best part is that you get to read Prince of Lies, a much better book,  next.	1999-10-23

Sheff makes it so  dramatic that you wonder whether he's making it all up because its almost  too good to be true.	1999-09-08
US	52708719	R3U1XOLJI2R0IR	0312860382	212689501	Darwinia	Books	5	1	2	N	N	An excellent book, but slightly flawed.	Like all of Wilson's books, Darwinia turned out to  be a real page turner.  I've been a huge fan of his since I found Gypsies at the library, and have found all of his work to be excellent, including Darwinia.<br />Like most of  his books, Darwinia focuses on a world that is suddenly changed  irrevocably.  But, unlike many authors, elements of character are always  paramount to the physical events of the book.  In most of Wilson's books,  this is an asset, especially in The Harvest, a book which contains some of  the most powerful and emotional characterizations found in any type of  literature.    In Darwinia, however, the focus on character seems at times  to make the story less cohesive.  While that main character of Guilford Law  is always interesting and compelling, I was saddened when I found that the  second half of the book focused less on the New World of Darwinia and more  on the cause of the New World's appearance.  The variety of new flora and  fauna in the first half of the book kept me interested and excited to find  out what would show up next, but in the second half of the book, that  excitement was missing.<br />I wouldn't say that the second half of the book  was bad, but in for my taste, I would have prefered for Wilson to wait  longer before revealing the cause of the Miracle, and spend more time  developing the landscape.<br />I would wholehearted reccomend this book to  anyone, but it is somewhat melancholy.  The end was very well done and was  not so ambiguous and dark as the end of his other works, like A Hidden  Place or The Harvest.  I felt that overall the book was excellent.	1999-08-31
US	52708719	R1X987QHEQEHD1	0451450574	679645063	Quad World (Roc)	Books	1	3	4	N	N	This book is awful.  Conceptually flawed and poorly written.	My beautiful girlfriend Nully gave me this book to torture me.  She said,  &quot;This is the worst book I ever read, and now you're gonna read  it.&quot;  I read it.  I wasn't happy. I would go into a detailed analysis,  but its too painful.  I'll just say that this book has unneccasarfy plot  twists every other page, about five or six different revelations about the  main character's ACTUAL identity, and a slew of annoying characters.  Just  stay away from it.	1998-09-25
