I READ THIS BOOK AWHILE BACK AND THE REASON I GIVE THIS BOOK ONLY 3 STARS IS BECAUSE I DONT REMEMBER MUCH OF IT.  MOST OF THE BOOKS I READ ARE SO GOOD THAT I REMEMBER THE MAIN PARTS, LIKE WHY KATHLEEN LEFT ERIK.  FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CAN'T REMEMBER.  I ALSO DID NOT LIKE THE FACT KATHLEEN WAS CHEATING ON SETH.  ALL SETH DID WAS LOVE HER AND TREAT HER WITH RESPECT.  ERIK IS OF COURSE A MAN THAT GETS WHAT HE WANTS, INCLUDING THE MARRIED WOMAN.   <br />THE THING THAT I LIKE WAS THE ENDING.

I LITERALLY PICK UP A BOOK AND WITHIN 2 DAYS ITS FINISHED AND THEN PICK UP ANOTHER ONE.  THIS BOOK WASNT SUSPENSEFUL OR TWISTED IN ANY WAY.  JUST A NICE BOOK TO READ.  IT WAS NICE STEPPING AWAY FROM SOME OF THE HARSH STUFF I'VE BEEN READING.  READ THIS ON A RAINING DAY.	2004-06-22
US	29658551	R2ZSSNJMYZRCM6	0446612812	841117264	Have You Seen Her?	Books	5	4	5	N	N	MY FIRST BOOK	WOW!  This was literally my first book that I've read on my own and what a book!  Before this book was introduced to me by my boss I hated to read.  I thought why would I waste my time on reading a book when I have a 2 year old who keeps me busy enough.  I was so glad that I started this book.  From the moment I started reading I was hooked.  I took every free moment I had to read.  Since this book I've read other romance/suspense books but this in particular was my all time favorite.  Ms. Rose knows how to grab a reader from the beginning.  I have to admit the love scenes caught me a bit off guard.  I didn't realize you could be so descriptive when it came to that subject.  <BR>I would have to highly recommend this book.  It's well worth it to add to your library.<BR>A bit of advice before you start this book.  Read Don't Tell first.  I didn't have the pleasure of reading it first, but when I did I was kind of disappointed in myself for not reading first.  Don't Tell, which is just as good as Have You Seen Her, will answer questions you might have in this book.  Enjoy!!!	2004-06-10

Although I was not impressed with the ending I did enjoy probably about 3/4 of the book.  There were just little things that bothered me.  Like for instance unless my memory is shot I thought when Sybill was at the family party Phillip drove her back to her hotel in his car yet the next day she drove in her car, which was left behind at Quinn's home the night before, to go talk to Anna.  Does that make sense?  One big guestion I have is that if Sybill never really knew what love meant how can she fall so fast and quickly in love with Phillip?  Another big thing that put me off with this book was that it doesn't really tell you much about Phillip.  To me the book was more about Seth and Sybill.  Maybe I just need to read the other series books to understand.	2004-06-09
