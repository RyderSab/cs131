The good thing in this book is that it does give the reader the spy network that the Soviets had in other countries and how the info that they've gathered went to Stalin and also the letters that Hitler supposedly written to Stalin(although the authenticity has not been comfirmed). This book shows all the more that Staln committed a grave military blunder in ignoring all the warnings, which cost millions of lives and almost cost the destruction of the Soviet Union and anyone whose intrested in learning more about the espisode of WW2 should read this book.	2005-10-09

I really like the fact that the book explores thier similarities and their diffrences in personality, command style, and circumstances in which they found themselves under. <br /> <br />The one weakness that the book has is that I couldn't use the bibliography all that much in looking up instances and I found myself somewhat frustrated. <br /> <br />Despite this flaw, I think that this is a very good book about Patton and Rommel which should be read.	2005-07-11

However, for those who want to learn more about what happened andwho are researching it(like myself), I do not think that this is a suitible book since it doesn't go into the \\"what\\" and especially not the \\"why\\". <br /> <br />All in all, despite the defecienties(which are somewhat considerable), it is a good book(especially for those who want to know about these people).	2005-01-25

The book basicially gives you the G2 on a lot of things that militaries use in the past, in the present and will use in the future in that great \\"Gunny style\\". <br /> <br />This is a great book for fans of the show, for historians, for military mensas and for anyone who is in or knows someone who is in the military. <br /> <br />For these reasons, I highly recommend this book.	2005-01-04

I personally think that the best part about the book is that you get to learn about the long-term effects of these types of incidents(and puts to rest some notions, especially that the communities are unified, when this book shows that is clearly not the case), but the one problem that I do have with the book is that the author tends to repeat the same points over exessively. <br /> <br />Definitely recommended reading for educators and anyone who's intrested in the dymanics of school shootings.	2004-07-22

I thought that the foward that she wrote was very incredulious and, with the fact that she is one of the people that are suing the parents of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, somewhat two-faced.<br />I thought that this was a very underpar book and I would not recomment it.	2003-07-11
