Chip Kidd, graphic designer of book jackets and what not has finally decided to write a book of his own.  The book is about a dude going to college in the 1950s and dealing with a zany, ecclectic teacher that is self assured and downright perterbed with society.  He wants things to be more imaginative and sincerely challenges his students to make the best out of his class: Graphic Design.  It's a book about taking what you have and making something out of it.  it's about taking your life and doing something important and leaving behind a legacy that, even if nobody witnesses it, you will be able to feel pride in your own undertakings.  <BR>There is some egotistic undertones of college savants, but that adds to the enjoyment.  Take this book with a grain of salt because it's not quite salient enough alone, that is unless you view it as a piece of art.  I think Kidd does.

[[[[[From The Battalion]]]]]]<br />Sam the Cat is an original and feisty piece of American fiction. Klam takes a big torch and burns away pretense and facade. This collection of seven short stories disregards everybody's concerns and emotions but the teller's. In many ways, this novel is naked, but does not shy away from its nakedness - it runs into crowds. <br />The title story, \\"Sam the Cat,\\" is about a guy who constantly attempts to find comfort in his life. He constantly dates women and enjoys sex in a vain attempt to settle into society. <br />At a bar, Sam's eyes follow a pair of legs from the ground up - along the calves, thighs, midsection, up the back, the neck, and finds himself convinced that this is what he is looking for. The head turns quickly and he is staring eye-to-eye with another man. This does not align with his world view, but he somehow finally feels comfortable. <br />This is the type of story Klam is going to tell. He deals with the emotions that people feel. He is bold and uncut and tells the whole truth. The truth is not that Sam is gay or straight, but that he is thinking, feeling and discovering. <br />In \\"There Should be a Name for It,\\" Klam details a beautiful relationship of love and happiness that is interrupted by an unplanned pregnancy. Jack treats his wife Lynn disrespectfully and leaves her and her mother to deal with the pregnancy. The mother's only advice comes in a foreign language: aborto, that is, abortion. Jack's tragic abandonment, both emotionally and physically of Lynn is Klam's social commentary of the harsh reality women face. <br />Klam has a voice that is shamelessly honest. His article on romancing the drug ecstasy in the New York Times Magazine is a perfect example. He is relentless in his pursuit of accuracy. Although hard to accept, the quality is necessary to get attention. <br />Through his stories, Klam invents the reality of individualism - the notion that events happen differently to different people and thatthere are no standard rules for response or reaction. From the outside looking in, perhaps that is the notion readers have the most trouble dealing with.	2001-09-16

Palahniuk asks us to pretend to think deeply about the reason we treadmill through life hiding our problems and insecurities behind the guise of perceived imperfection and incapabilities.<br />Choke is the freeze-framed version of Fight Club that went over our heads in a cloud of nihilism. It was never about nihilism; it was about questioning the path that's brought us here.. This nine-inch nail is hit hard and driven past the cerebral cortex into the very crux of human depravity, emotion and despair.<br />Nymph-O and museum worker Victor Mancini discovers at a young age that - during a moment of choking - &quot;...the whole world cared what happened to him.&quot; When flailing and turning blue, he was on center stage and in a position to make the one who saved him a hero. Victor intentionally chokes to manipulate the &quot;hero&quot; nightly. The hero then plays a paternal/maternal role, virtually sponsoring his egregious lifestyle and subsidizing his Alzheimer's-exasperated mother. This also includes cards on birthdays, calls on holidays. <br />Thus Palahniuk constructs a cockamamie, ludicrous storyline and asks us to enjoy his humor and bizarre plot's unfolding. Laughing out loud is simply inescapable. But the plot is merely a physical embodiment that draws us inside. Although the storyline is absurd, that only sets up a foil for his brilliant microscoping of human emotions and desperation. The plot adds the thickness of void fulfillment upon introducing Denny the, um, rock-collector, except that is too casual. Denny is the comedic avatar of overkill.<br />Some have called Choke's Victor an antihero, but they are not seeing the big picture: heroes no longer take on the form of men in blue tights and red capes - the new hero, the Palahniuk hero fights his battles within his mind, life. This is represented by Choke's first-person cataloging of introspection and inner struggle not to decide based on precedent. <br />In Palahniuk's world, there is no Xanadu, no Brigadoon. The reality is dystopia. Within this construct tragic is interchangable with realistic. Life is not clean. &quot;There are chickens with no legs...Blind chickens without eyes. Without beaks. Born that way. Defective. Born with their little chicken brains already scrambled.&quot;	2001-09-04

The book was great as far as the character portrayal went, word choice, metaphors, but the ending was jacked.<br />I'm furious to read books such as these.  Steinbeck acknowledges a problem with society and so he 'corrects' it.  FYI Stein, you can't just kill problems.<br />Lennie is a poor dull-thinking, massive ogre who travels from farm to farm with 'friend' George.  They stop at one farm where Curley and his 'soft fist' presides.  <br />Curley is a wee man and he picks on Lennie.  Lennie counterpoints by shattering Curley hand altogether.  The story is entertaining, and going good.<br />Then Lennie gets a little overzealous and kills a woman.  Whoops!  He had no idea because he is not mentally there.  He is a kind man who thinks as a boy and is still trapped in the stage William Blake referred to as Innocence.  <br />Steinbeck takes unecessary measures to get Lennie out of the picture and uses George as the tool.<br />I've said it before and I'll say it again: If Steinbeck wrote a proposal for a plan to 'deal with' retards it would be written well but would be substanially devoid of heart and humanity.<br />Nobel Prize or Zombie Lies?  Are people actually READING his book?  Something seems puffer fish and cursory about his esteemed station in society as a literary great.	2001-03-24

From The Monitor<br />Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist, a semi-biographical book, is unrefined tedium consisting mostly of unrequited personal correspondence, to wit: an amalgamation of rambled letters sans response during an eight-year span, 1968-1976, in the life of Hunter S. Thompson.  This book is conceptually flawed in its publisher's-literally-clearinghouse mentality of profiteering: selling \\"Hunter S. Thompson\\" without tilting at integrity.  What editor Douglas Brinkley has done, in effect, is organize Thompson's e-mail outbox by date, print them, slap on a cover and insert a suppressed envy/spite congratulatory forward by David Halberstram. The next logical step was stamping on it, an adhesive price tag.  Fear and Loathing in America has accomplished nothing, save slake the palates of Fear-and-Loathing-junkie-sponges who fiend for everything and anything Thompson. <br />Thompson, who is infamous/famous for his \\"Gonzo\\" journalism, the Visigoth-resistant, in-the-trenches-to-write-and-write-I-will attitude, has failed miserably.  Fear and Loathing in America is an anecdote after years of swine success.  Thompson seems to have gone to the Darkside: sellout commercialism.  At no point in Fear and Loathing in America does the book make an effort.<br />The letters, individually, from Thompson are to his mother, strange bedfellow Oscar Acosta-the assumed Samoan attorney character in Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey in the Heart of the American Dream, his various editors and publishers, etc...  These letters are interesting in a voyeuristic sense and for the politic/journalism pundits on, perhaps, a nostalgic-reminiscence level, but otherwise platitude. The quality of Fear and Loathing is its humanization of anti-heroified Thompson.  It showcases his struggles and emotions unmolested, uncut, and unrevised.  Fear and Loathing can be inspirational in this regard as encouragement for felled and flailingauthors slumming to make it in the seemingly more-sinister-than-execution, \\"publish or perish\\" world.  <br />Thompson's letters to his brother regarding tuition and to The Alaskan Sleeping Bag CO regarding a returned \\"Alaska Hunting Coat\\" which, according to Thompson looked nothing like the picture in the catalogue, are simply not worth reading.  Despite the authorship and book jacket featuring a 1960s Thompson, this book reads nothing like the picture.<br />Disappointing at best, Fear and Loathing in America is hopefully a brief stutter before Thompson decides to say something profound as he has done with a furious and frothing pen in the past.	2001-03-24

I won't spend too much time discussing plot, but briefly, it's about an indigent, indigenous family who thrives, er, exists on fishing and pearl-diving.  Kino, the man of the house, finds a beautiful pearl one day.  It is supposed to be the panacea that brings him and his family out of their impoverished strife. It could buy his wife new clothes and SHOES! and send his son to school.<br />Instead Steinbeck lets the pearl represent all that is bad, corrupt, evil and avarice.  He paints Kino a fiend for wanting a better station for his family.  I will not say the end is a fag's end, but let me say, Of Mice and Men ended in a similarly dismal note.<br />How would Steinbeck address today's problems of poverty?  I don't know, but I have a feeling his welfare policies would be well written (as far as diction goes) but substantially desperate.	2001-03-24

(not since the opener to Ray Bradbury's Farenheit 451 that is: &quot;It was a pleasure to burn.&quot;)<br />The Gunslinger is one of the most romantic (think Hemmingway, Nelson Algren) novels of all time.  Our hero is the last of the Mohicans, so to speak, in a land where shi--err--stuff has happend and the world has moved on.  <br />Desolate disaster and death lies behind every town's facade and there is one man who can possibly put an end to the wrong; a true man that can but try: the gunslinger.  He escapades across desserts and mountains in search of the Dark Tower--the eiffel that holds the worlds (Earth, his world, and the existing others) together.  Along the way he meets a boy named Jake. Jake is a piece of the puzzle that the gunslinger must solve, a pawn to the Dark Man's chess game.  <br />It is a blood-sworn journey the gunslinger is on.  His past, his training, and lost lovers are stops along the way.  The only solution he knows lies in his Sandalwood grip pistols crisscrossing his midsection.  It is a sad tale, but a very palatable one if you reflect on how our world too has moved on.  <br />If you love King or hate him, let The Gunslinger set the record straight.  It is the first in a (currently unfinished) Dark Tower series and is like nothing King has ever pinned.  It is a dark novel which exists in sour dreams.  The best, the best King has done.  It's straight from the hip of his drug-addled past (a fact that is evident in the novel).  <br />This book is one that has been overlooked by movies, universities, demagogues and egotists, but mark my words: The Gunslinger will emerge in the 21st century as a powerful novel, as evident and poignent in society as Romeo &amp; Juliet; once dissected, will be served in High School along with sloppy joes, John Steinbeck.<br />Kevin Burns	2001-03-24

Why is Hispanic literature not recognized as American Literature?  Why is the economic and political advancement of Latinos stagnant?  Why has \\"American media...made it clear that mainstream society does not have time, space, or inclination to focus attention on Hispanic matters\\"? Growing up in Edinburg, Texas, Portales has examined the traits and plights of the Latino people with his own eyes rather than solely through sheets of statistics.  Portales, existing in the midst of the Latino struggle for social equity, has not only blamed \\"white America,\\" or \\"media America,\\" but also places blame on the Hispanic Americans.  For example, the Latino high school dropout rate is 47%; Portales chides Latino parents' apathy, charging them insouciant, and attacks the public education system for being defunct and placing the weight of the educational heavens on the assumed Atlas- teachers.<br />Portales, during an internal struggle, chose to title his book \\"Crowding out Latinos.\\"  His original title was, \\"Crowding Out Latinos?\\"  Upon further examination, the latter title was too imprecise, too wishy-washy, and failed to state the problem, but instead, question its existence.  This brand of noncommitment, claimed Portales in conversation with me, is a step in the adverse direction, a step that America has hitherto preferred.<br />Portales boasts, \\"The United States Census for the year 2000 is sure to count more than 32million Latinos.\\"  With America's total population standing near 273million, roughly one out of every nine Americans will be Hispanic.  Howmuch larger will the Hispanic elephant need to grow before gaining recognition in the American room?<br />Crowding Out Latinos is a well-written treatise to rally Hispanics, nay, to call America to arms and face the problems of a pained and struggling people, a people without whom, America-the ideal, the liberty-would not exist.<br />(All information within is either cited within the book or gathered from conversations with Marco Portales)	2001-03-24

You've been here before if you follow King.  King is the greatest novelest of his time-nobody supplants you into a book as well.   He is more than just a horror author and has proved that in novels such as The Green Mile and Hearts in Atlantis, and I would argue, Wizard and Glass (a beautifully romantic piece.)  However, he puts down horror in Dreamcatcher, his time-tested strut. Meet the SSDD guys, Henry, The Beav, Pete, and Jonesy (friends from grade school, now middle-age).  They go to a cabin known as &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot; once a year for hunting.  This trip however holds some extra-err-terrestrial surprises.  Once you meet McArthy you will understand. If you were of the many that damned King's last few publications (I am not among that number) then this novel will ressurect King in your mind as this flatlining, show-stopping, heart-palpitating novel scares you into wet pants. Dreamcatcher has the feel of old King (think suspense levels of Christine and The Shining) with the character situating of Desperation, with underpinnings of a cynic yet religious King who relies heavily on mysticism and human nature to win battles. You know it's King, you KNOW it's good, stop wasting time with reviews and get on it!  Sweet Dreams.	2001-03-21

Impressed?         Aztec is an epic historical fiction novel, often categorized with James Clavell's Shogun or the works of James A. Michener, which enraptures its audience with a firsthand vivid account of the 16th century life of the Mexicatl (Aztec) people in their city Tenochtitlan (present-day Mexico City).  Jennings uses `Mixtli' which is Nahuatl (language) for Dark Cloud, to tell the story of his life ab ovo. Mixtli tells his story to an audience consisting of friars, a bishop and scribes whom were charged by the King of Spain to write down verbatim the words that escaped Mixtli's mouth so that his august Majesty could know of the people (Aztecs) he had recently conquered.<br />Jennings reveals a people, a place, and a time period that is often forgotten.  He takes you through religious ceremonies, sacrifices, and festivities that are completely alien to any of today. The myths, suppositions and lore of the Mexica people come alive through Mixtli's narration.  Mixtli's life is exciting and diverse, he wears many hats: a scribe or `word knower', a peddler of booty, a passionate and sometimes clumsy lover, a cartographer and a very unlikely warrior.  Mixtli travels throughout his nation and to far off lands and experiences much through intention, and more often, through error.  He learns various tongues along his travels and eventually picks up Spanish, which makes him a great but reluctant tool of the Spaniards. So much of Jennings' novel is comprised of such a wealth of sensible, believable information that it is easy to forget Aztec is a fictional account. I would be hard pressed to prove or disprove the elements of truth in Aztec.  I can only rely on the experts: Professor J. Pino of Kent State University found Aztec's representation of cultureand religion a \\"total horselaugh\\"; the Denver Post had this to say: \\"The history, geography, art, literature, and religion of the Aztecs are all here, along with a wealth of information about the people themselves and the way they went about the business of living.\\"  Now what?  Even the `experts' seem dubious. To any reader of historical fiction, it should be evident that certain liberties are taken regarding factual information; something may be added or subtracted, or even sugarcoated for effect, this is often called `artistic licensing'.    <br />Whether or not you believe Aztec is a grandiose misrepresentation of the Mexica people during Spain's occupation in Mexico during the 1500's, or an accurate story down to the letter about the ways and means of a great people, you simply cannot deny Jennings' skill of seizing readers' curiosity, welding their hands to the book.  Although, I must admit there were times when I felt dirty reading portions where Mixtli nonchalantly addressed incest or grisly religious rituals, purportedly indigenous of the Aztec people, it has been the best read of the summer.  In reading Aztec, I spent most of time admiring Lake Texacoco, enjoying walks through the great city of Tenochtitlan, and despising the \\"smelly\\" Spaniards for their `divine' right to pursue \\"Gold, Glory and God\\". I could empathize with Mixtli in the good times and the bad. <br />However, when you pickup Aztec, don't expect a quick read, for it is 1000+ pages, but expect to live, or at least dream of life among the Mexica people for days to come. Jennings has finished this race first place.	2001-01-25

The Dark man has entered the world and is working his dark magic as everyone falls under his spell of plague except the fortunate few who have some chromosomal indifference to death.  The characters have a choice which is more closely linked to a calling pulling them either for good (GOd) or evil Dark Man.  We jest at ourselves unbelieving that his identity is the same as Satan's.  Will good champine over evil?  Let your previous King experience be your guide, or better yet, pour through this oft poetic text of mayhem until the bitter/beautiful end.	2001-01-22

He cordones off sanity for the duration of a few kids innocence.  Trial strikes in the form of evil incarnate. The plot of it is one of King's best.  He sculpts good v evil every time with the perfect clay.  It is hard to withstand the draw of voyerism to see into the post innocent, for the most part, post Derry chapter of these kids' (now adults)lives.  This book is SCARY.  Forget what you've heard and forget what you've seen edited on the Superstation.  IT is a pants-wetter.  In the depth of night, reading with just a singular light in the house, you will shiver, and inevitably you will have to take a restroom break.  My suggestion to you is bring a ward of evil along.  Be wary when you lift the toilet seat. Boo, a real frightfest.	2001-01-22

He is not a great author, that is why i'm only giving it 4 stars.  At his absolute best, he is only a 4.  Michael Brock is a power DC attorney who decides to live life, like marky mark, on the wild side.  He goes into near pro-bono street law, a step down from his emminent partnership in a world-class law firm.  The read is quick, fast paced--perfect for a 2hr flight.  There is not much potency in a Grisham novels, but in this at least, there is story.  This is a worthwile read albeit it does not really solve the moral problems of today, it solves another: entertainment.  This book is entertaining, and mindless.  Take a break from reality.

It is a tale of bloody debutchery, sex, Christianity, and of course, redemption. A queerincidence is that while reading the books in tandom, Regulators first and then Desperation, I was purged by two utterly physical reactions.  At points King is so graphic in Regulators that my stomach, reeling, nearly exploded in a green-pea-soup of vomit.  That being physical side-effect numero uno, during Desperation, I was so into the Johnny Marionville character that my heart sped up and my eyes gushed tears as the book ended.  Juxtaposing these two emotions tells me that King has a knack for evoking reaction from his works.  You cannot simply pick up a Kingian book, read it, then move along; he makes you think and makes you feel.  Stephen King is one of the most provocative authors, truly gifted with a penchanct for great dialogue, surreal action, and cathartical closure.  Desperation is his best.	2001-01-21

So here she is, on trial for the death of her father.  What happens next is predictable and totally canned.  The blades in the series seem to get more and more decrepit and less romantically deified. I hate to draw this tragic paralell, but the new brand of blades are Wolverine without his adamantium, for those of you who remember that time...  I had trouble facing the last 150pages because they were no doubt going to be as dusty as the first 150.  I'm jaded.  I have wanted to hear tales of triumph, exploits and adventure within the margins of A Tale of Kings Blades--series (because that is what they are)but I've been let down, and with Sky of Swords most of all.

Never has life been pictured in a more abstract-realism pastiche of trial, error, depspite and purification.  TragicHero Thomas Covenent is the best and most philosophizing character of all time.  He revels in pain and despair, dealing with the ultimate social paralysis, leprosy.  He lives in a land of spite and distrust and is transferred to another place, The Land.  What happens next shakes up Urlord's reality.  Everything changes and rather than be ignored, he is honored and charged by expectation.  This is the perfect story for all infirmnities.  The introspection of TC is revolutionary, as it discusses the battle of despair.  If you have not read this book, I cannot help you.  Feel the Land work, take away, work, take away...ARGH Covenant!

So much of the nature of the series, both one and two, are revealed through the poetic form of Donaldson's delightful prose.  This book has been said to drag on by some readers, but this is innacurate, because Donaldson doesn't waste words.  Everything is necessary to meet an ultimate climax.  The new giants are wonderful and giants in general bring so much hope for humanity whereas Covenant can bring cynicism and Lord Foul despair.  Vain is a mystery and symbolic on a level: there is no one cure that will dispell all hurt and despair.  But, Covenant is the white gold... This book is beautiful.	2001-01-20

Raider is truly a pimp in his own swordweilding right.  He is a student from Ironhall--as seen in Gilded Chain, but refuses to serve the king.  Conflict of interests as well as metaphysical no-nos constitute this.  Duncan has us follow Raider to the neighboring land of savage and fire.  Chivial, the setting for Gilded Chain, has been warring with the 'fire lands' for many years and is an arch enemy.  Raider's birthright and special circumstances make for a good read, however, Duncan is somehow lacking as an author.  It is hard to put a finger on--the storyline is fantastic, but the manner in which he writes is somewhat lackluster.  It is easy to find yourself too mired to go on, and just then something worth half of the builded expectation takes place, yet you continue to read.  The mysteries and unclarity about future events, that innate catlike curiousity is fundamental for a Duncan reader.  Without this natural querity, this book would fail.  Marginal, good at best, Lord of the Fire Lands ranks 3.	2001-01-20

There seems to be nothing but despair as the evil sunbane has taken over and the beautiful people sacrifice bits of theirselves to conjure power everytime.  There seems to be no way out as Harukai are fettered in the catacombic bowels of a prison waiting to bleed for the sunbane.  The unreality and the unjustification of such incidence pains the reader, praying for a panacea to cure this rotten state.  Thomas Covenant is the only hope and Linden Avery makes for a new hope.  This piece is written perfection of everything wrong in the world, the corruptible everything, and the curable nothing.  This paralell with mankind is insightful and poignant.  This book is intriging and painful, but no doubt, one of Donalson's best.	2001-01-20

Let it be known that I just finished Bentley Little's The Ignored right before I poked around Bad Karma, thus through a fiendishly evil pair of eyes I roved the grey-lit passages of (real author) D Clegg's mindwarping mayhem.

It's hard to say much about this book, hard to speak of the catharsis and emotional whirlwind that breezes through the brain and heart of a reader.  The title itself speaks volumes, however dubious.  It is an apt title, but one that also begs question.  This is no fag end.  Donaldson, I believe knew where he was going all along in the battle of despair and despite.  He knows the world through the jaded eyes of knowing a killer (leprosy) and knowing the pain it can cause.  This book serves as an inspiration to humanity on a social level, and an inspiration to writers on a professional level.  Never has 'fantasy' been so well defined.  I will never forget the Land or the giants who were filled with a mournful myrth or the bloodgaurds(haruchai) who gave their lives in service for a greater good and I will never forget the Chronicles (1&amp;2) which instilled in my life such peace to unrest, such love to despite.	2001-01-20

Donaldson is craftwork majic.  He has extended his prose into the third novel, THe Power that Preserves.  It is impossible not to read the final chapter of this epic work known as the 1st Chronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbeliever.  Characters such as Saltheart and Bannor and Mhoram make this tale multi-dimensional.  The Land is in trouble and once again Covenent is called upon.  How Covenent cannot answer the call breaks my heart.  This is only momentary, because he indeed desides to roll up his sleeves and join in the fight against despair.  THere is no better chronicles or trilogies on the face of the planet.  Kudos Donaldson! Hooray Stephen R!  Covenant for President!  Excellent read and worth every minute.	2001-01-20

The idea is not that original: A king has rettainers known as blades, bound to serve with their life.  The special powers they have to protect their ward in times of exigence is non-standard, but possibly a spinoff from legendary tales such as Beowulf.  The novel lacks action, but when Duncan desides to infuse action, it is worth waiting for.  One scene with blade Durendal and immortal Herat is quite dazzling.  Durendal is a character to watch and is the most skilled of all blades, ostiensibly since the dawn of the Ironhall--the forge center for blades.  The book is good, but oftentimes corny and melodram.  Worth the paperback price, surely, but don't splurge on hardcover.	2001-01-20
US	49955888	R1VKZAJPSKDVNL	0375404120	939433309	Glamorama	Books	5	0	1	N	N	'Glam' according to Ellis	Glamorama, a first person narrative, is a very dishelving novel, a tour de macabre, in which Ellis relentlessly rails on the lifestyles of the rich and famous through his poignant satire.   Bret Easton Ellis, author of Less Than Zero, The Rules of Attraction and others, scares me-not in the run-into-mommy-and-daddy's-bed-because-a-monster (in the form of blowing tree leaves) moves-about-outside-my-window way, but in a questioning humanity's depravity and pondering societies' moral existence sort of way. His writing is perfection of the English language.  He picks the sublime words and expressions to describe situations and uses the perfect pop culture allusions to demand your presence in every scene.  This is a profound literary feat, but at times you find yourself in racy, sexually explicit, and often deranged atmospheres, (i.e. manage-a-trois ending in mutilation,) which are uncomfortable-to say the least.   Victor Johnson/Ward is the main character and not necessarily a `model' citizen.   He attends photo shoots, poses for magazine covers, parties with the social elite of Hollywood, and is as empty as a pauper's wallet.  He treats women with an uncaring heir of arrogance-as if they merely exist for his entertainment-and drops them like last season's leather pants as soon as he finds someone better.   His conversational skill is-\\"um\\"-limited as well.  The moment some controversy or depth in topic arises, he immediately spouts out, \\"Um...baby, you look-er-Uma-ish, totally sexy.\\"  This is usually followed by a \\"thank-you Victor, you look great yourself,\\" or an abrupt exit by either party (moving on to something/someone better.)  Thus, Victor is the avatar-the physical embodiment-of self-centrism.  His motto is, \\"The better you look, the more you see,\\" very rich.  Ellis is making a statement about the lives and superficiality of Glam-America, the models, movie stars, fashion savants, et al, and how they seemingly sleepwalk through existence.   Where a normal satire stops, Ellis begins.  After you taste the shallow fruit of Glamorama, Ellis intrigues you with a perplexing and very mysterious plot.  With its abrupt turns and miss-leads, as a labryinth, the plot leaves the reader fingernail-biting nervous, fashed, and eager to find a way out.  Unfortunately, ending on the same note as Ellis' controversial book, American Psycho, \\"this is not an exit.\\" Pick up Glamorama because Ellis is incredible; because when the show stops and the director calls \\"cut\\" (you'll understand the director reference in good time) you will cheer for an encore, however, with sweaty palms and a somewhat shaky smile.	2000-11-12

Robbers  is of a faux-western cops and robbers brand written with neo millennium panache.  Robbers' threshold for audience entertainment and captivity is Texas-sized.  <br />Pulling over for gas and smokes<br />This book ignites into wild conflagration in the opening scene, when miscreant Eddie puts a bullet in the head of an \\"A-rab\\" cashier after squabbling over a penny and a pack of smokes.  Cook opens Grisham-like with this injection of drama, tightening the reader's grip of the novel.  After doing the deed, Eddie runs out to his ragtop Cadillac only to be chided by his partner-in-crime, Ray Bob, for neglecting to score the dough from the cash register.  Ray Bob, instead of accelerating for a mad escape, runs frustrated inside the 7-Eleven to finish the job.  His seemingly foolish and firebrand move is wont to make readers tense, but the delayed getaway drizzles a relaxing bit of humor.<br />  In steps the law<br />Rule Hooks is a Stetson wearing, Dodge truck driving Texas Ranger charged to capture the two villains Eddie and Ray Bob.  Hooks proudly comprises Texas cowboy stereotypes: drawl, racist tendencies and poor grammar, but with the do-you-feel-lucky schtick of Dirty Harry Callahan and the court-is-adjourned intelligence of Perry Mason.  His lines are not as graceful as those of Callahan but his guarded emotions, steely eyes, and cold calculation rival even the Dirty one.  He pursues the scoundrels relentlessly from Austin to Galveston, stopping along the way only to refill on women and rest.  <br />Christopher cooks<br />For a first time novelist, Cook shows potential, and then realizes it with his vivid veritas, on the money metaphors, and pull no punches prose.  Towards the beginning of Robbers Cook lays it on thick seeming eager and overstated.  As the book progresses, however, he sheds his verbose penchant and settles into a comfortable niche.  Also, his zero conversation quotation policy is annoying at the onset, but once the trend and pace of the book are revealed, it seems quotation marks would only inhibit his signature straight-story flow.   Cook writes in a seemingly satirical fashion sometimes as he reaches for the hyperbolic limits of human depravity just to gloss over them without remorse in a paled Bret Easton Ellis fashion.  Otherwise, his comedic attempts are straightforward and for the most part pointed in the roughneck/redneck Texas direction.  As an Austin, Texas resident, Cook is fully aware of the Texas reality, which can at times be funnier than fiction.  <br />Robbers in brief<br />Eddie and Ray Bob are killers.  Hooks is the law, therefore he chases them.  Eddie is usually kind, sensitive, slightly dim-intellectually speaking, and has no real intention to murder.  Ray Bob however, fiends unabashedly for bouts of the ultra violence.  Often, Eddie is merely along for the ride, a victim of circumstance, until he meets hitchhiker Della, and falls in love.  Della brings out the soft side in Eddie, which infuriates Ray Bob because he doesn't want to lose his \\"runnin' buddy.\\"  Hooks is rather apathetic to the soap opera drama that is a bizarre crime triangle; he only cares about his numero uno objective: chase down the elusive convenience store killers.   Robbers has the normal ingredients of a cop and robber story, but is saved from being trite by Christopher Cook and his chronically fast paced literary force feeding savoir faire.  For a new writer, Cook brings intrigue and cannot be overlooked as a bright and upcoming fiction author.	2000-11-12
