I really enjoyed this book and highly recommend to all that this is one to read. <br />The story is a bit inspirational but by all means, the story is not too \\"cushy\\" it has plenty of \\"meat\\" and real life on the pages. Have you ever wondered \\"What would happen if.....?\\" or \\"I wonder what became of so-and-so after I......?\\" <br />That's one of the formats of this book that makes it so good and very different. Great storyline! <br />I do feel that the proof reader could have double checked the writing one more time because there were a few mistakes that could have been corrected which would have made the flow of reading a bit better. <br />Great story though and a book that I think would be enjoyed by everyone. <br /> BH  5/29/05	2005-05-29

When I saw this book on Oprah, I wanted to purchase it and read all of the tidbits of priceless info it has packed into it. It is a terrific book to help us all learn the \\"why and how\\" our bodies need to be taken care of.  <br />After seeing this book and the authors on GMA, I was inspired to write this review in hopes to spread my enthusiasm about this published nugget of knowledge about how simple it really is and can be for all of us to be healthier and live longer lives. <br />I enjoyed the breakdown of chapters focused on certain body systems as well as the quizzes that I was able to take. <br />I highly recommend purchasing this book.  <br />The simplicity of the explanations and the analogies used make this book worth having on all of our bookshelves. What a wonderful teaching tool that we can share with our children. Maybe we can all start a generation of healthier-eating young adults. Wouldn't that be magnificent?!! <br />Great book!!!	2005-05-10

Lots of clues but no give away information.<BR>This is the first book I've read by this author but it won't be my last, that's for sure.<BR>There's small town politics threaded through the whole story. It gives the book a touch of humor without turning the story into a silly whimsy......far from it! Very serious &quot;who-done-it&quot; situations. A story showing how some politicians can play a game with innocent people and how rock stars can mesmerize their fans.<BR>Who is this sick serial killer? Is there a connection between the super Rock Star, the murderer, and the philandering mayor?<BR>The character developement is terrific. <BR>The story is one that is interesting right up to the last pages and is FULL of surprises!<BR>Add this to your list of &quot;must read&quot; books.<BR>A story you will remember for a long time.	2002-08-28

Here is a story told through mental reflections of the past by a woman struggling with reality and skeletons in her family's closet.<BR>The writing and telling of this story about post partum depression is outstanding. The words flow between the past and the present as Ellen tries to put her adult life together and deal with every day situations.<BR>How can a loving mother be consumed with such a depression? How can a loving family handle living their lives and understand post partum depression? This book was an eye opener for me.<BR>How can a very loving father and husband keep life going in a normal direction while he's dealing with this type of sad situation?<BR>I recommend this book, but not to everyone.

I bought this book after attending a book signing and hearing Sue Monk Kidd read a chapter.<br />This author took a lot of her time to chat with everyone. Ms. Kidd is a wonderful person and after hearing the chapter she read, I was captivated!!<br />I learned a lot from this book of fiction. The turmoil of the Civil Rights movement was brought to life in a personal kind of way, because I felt like I knew Lily and the Boatright sisters.<br />I didn't live in the Charleston, SC area until 1979, and now that I read this book, I understand so much more about the people here and the challenges everyone faced.<br />Lily is a survivor.<br />Her mother passed away when Lily was a very young girl. Lily hung onto a tiny handful of memories, which lead her to her \\"adopted\\" family and knowledge of her mother's personality and relationship to Lily's tough, crude father.<br />This is a story with bits of surprises woven through the story. It's also a story of friendship, love, understanding, and forgiveness.<br />A wonderful book by a terrific author! I highly recommend reading this book.<br />I personally think it would be a great education piece for high schools because the story brings the Southern 1960s to life in a very interesting, relatable way!	2002-06-21

I enjoyed this book and following each character in the story. We all know a person who has lost their life in an auto accident, so this book will touch a nerve in almost any reader, man or woman.<BR>   The story starts off a little bit slow while introducing the characters, but a story based in a lazy, friendly, small Southern town can't start off any other way. The pace soon picks up and you will have a hard time setting this book down.<BR>   There is a bit of mystery and wonder twisted through the story. Who could've done such a terrible thing? Wait until you read this book and find out the circumstances of each person in the wonderous sleepy little town in North Carolina.<BR>   The emotional ups and downs of a man who has lost the love of his life, will keep the reader turning pages. Watch how sadness changes a his outlook on life. Will he come back to being himself? Will he ever love again? Read this book, if you are looking for a book with &quot;real&quot; people and emotions.<BR>   When Jonah, the young little boy who lost his mother, is treated with kid gloves by teachers, and it almost costs him reading and learning skills until the right teacher comes along.<BR>   A great book and well worth reading. Will this end up being a movie, too? It sure could, and it would be a good one!	2002-06-05

First, let me say that this is an excellent book, and I will read more by this author! She has a gift for writing with feeling and her use of adjectives makes the reader actually &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;smell&quot; India. Great book!<BR>   Anju and Sudah are girls that were born on the same day to mothers that just received horrible news about their husbands and then went into premature labor.<BR>   The 2 girls grow up closer than sisters and have a secret sense between them, very similar to identical twins. As the girls grown up, one of them moves to the USA and becomes more &quot;Americanized&quot; while the other stays in India and holds on to the &quot;old traditions&quot;. A lot changes, but their love and bond between them stays strong.<BR>   I highly recommend reading this book. It will be enjoyed and easily relatable by any woman. The interaction of grandmothers, mothers, daughters, and aunts is wonderful to read and watch.<BR>   There is a nice little surprise in the story to give it a touch of suspense and wonder.<BR>    Arranged marriages and life's circumstances test the connection between Sudha and Anju, which keeps the reader thoroughly engrossed. <BR>   This is a novel that can not be put down, once you start reading.

This is a story told by a man at 3 different times in his life. The author's descriptive writing of WWI was perfect and gives the reader the understanding of how grusome the front line was. But also the story conveys the closeness and familiarity of the soldiers during their lives traveling to the front line. It's quite an appreciated lesson in history. Patrick's bonding and friendship with Daniel is touching, in a masculine way, and carries over to has caring of Julia.<BR>The wonderful story from an 81 year old's view of his life is so amazingly real. This story should make any reader view their elders in a new way. The storyline is so perfect. At times it is a little depressing but that's because this story is so real and life is depressing at times. But this story is also blissful at times. The love and care that is obviously given by Patrick to everyone connected to him is the bittersweet part of this story.<BR>I highly recommend everyone to read this book. It would be enjoyed by men and women. It's an excellent history lesson as well as a lesson about life. I am very glad that I read this book.	2002-01-25

Joyce is entering a lonely stage in her life because her daughter is growing older and more distant as well as a lack of connection to her husband.

This is one of the best gifts I've ever given my children entering adulthood. It's short, caring, and a quick easy to read up lifting book. The writing explains to the reader to pay heed to your &quot;second attention&quot; which is the fact that you have what you need inside and to use it. Reading this book helps the reader to understand that none of us should take the reactions of other people so personally. The teachings here are so very basic and reading this book just basicly helps the reader understand life and tolerate it better. I highly recommend reading this little piece of knowledge and see how it will change the way you react to situations and feel more in control of your life.

This was a book that I bought and read only because it was our book club choice and THANK GOODNESS for that or I would've never read this terrific piece about history and foreign culture. Wonderful book....one Oprah's very best picks.<BR>The writing is beautiful and brings new understanding about India's struggles with poverty and caste systems. The bittersweet cultures and traditions are displayed through this story using 4 main characters and involving many background characters to make this book so realistic that as a reader, I felt like I actually visited this country and knew the characters. I didn't always like some of the characters but I could feel their sadness, their fright, their loss and sorrow, and even their desire to make it.<BR>I recommend everyone, yes everyone to pick this book up and read it. It is long. It is, at times, depressing. It is, at times, cruel. And there are some scenes written about that are rather crude. But all of this is needed to tell the story of India during the 70s and the changes it was going through as well as the corrupt government. Here's a book to make an American feel the privileges our country gives us, or any truely free country.<BR>This is a book that would be great for seniors in high school to read eventhough there are some explicit and dramatic scenes written about that don't paint a very pretty picture.<BR>And the author's writing is tremendous. Flowing with the book's activities put together in a way that makes the reader very anxious to keep reading. The use of some Indian words did slow the reading a bit for me but the story would not have felt so authentic or have such an impact without them.<BR>This is a gem of a book. A true &quot;travel-read&quot; into another time and culture. It has opened my eyes to a different time and place in history and I'm very thankful it was a book club choice and that I read this book. Highly, highly recommended.	2002-01-05

I am a reader of self help and positive thinking type of books. I read this particular book when it first came out in '96...almost 6 years ago....and it still remains a favorite for me. It touches on more than the common &quot;rah rah rah&quot; method. This book makes you realize the unbelieveable strengths that we are ALL born with, but that we don't develope. All of my life I've heard the term &quot;mind over matter&quot; and didn't pay it much attention. This book puts reality to that saying and now I truely understand what it means. The human mind is a God-made computer and none of us use our brain to it's fullest potential. Ms. Milteer writes with such an easy flow, that this book is hard to set down, almost like a novel!!! It's astonishing.<BR>Excellent book that I seriously recommend to everyone....readers and non-readers. The ideas and the realization that this book brings will change your life and give you control of yourself and the situations that are presented to you....large and small.<BR>During a week's bout with the flu, I picked this book up just to thumb through it and ended up reading it again....thank heaven.

It's very quick read giving the reader a feeling of reading a girl's journal and developing into a story as the girl, Gretel, grows up. The relationships between Gretel and her mother and her cousin and her bestfriend,Jill, are the center of this book. <BR>This is a story of real life. There's the brother who has everything going for him, including a chance to go to Harvard. Gretel watches the strength that her mother shows in the open but hears her mother's emotional pain at night. Gretel is brought up around strong women and knows how to survive and be a strong woman herself.<BR>I enjoyed this book tremendously and will recommend it to anyone looking for a very good book to read. <BR>Gretel and the people in her life are very relateable. She endures loosing family members, money struggles, resentful teen years. <BR>Upon finishing this book there is a moral to the story. Money and social position don't always equal happiness and love.<BR>Do pick this book up and read it. It's a very quickstory with a lot to say.	2001-12-14

The first thing I have to say about this book is that it's funny and will make the reader understand how a super large family really can make it financially.<BR>I read this book the first time because it was required in junior high (now known as middle school). I just read it again with my teenage daughters to maybe bring some understanding to them about saving time and money and that time is money. This father is the king of creative spending and overlapping chores to save time.<BR>A very enjoyable book to read. This is an excellent book to co-read with your children of any age and might help you get a few frugal points accross to them. <BR>It's a comical read laced with some very neccesary ideas of financial knowledge.<BR>This is a quick book to read, and in my case a shared time of family financial understanding. Don't pass up reading this fun book. It'll make you laugh and think...&quot;That's a good idea.&quot; reading about dad's fanatical penny pinching ways. <BR>A great story that everyone should read.	2001-12-12

During their reunion, they talk to Madam Zoya the futune teller/psychic who gives them a chance to go back into their life and change life's direction if they choose. Some choose to and some don't. It's interesting to watch lives take such different directions because of only 1 choice change.<BR>This book will make the reader think about choices made and maybe choices not made and maybe choices wished were made.<BR>The small amount of time travel was very interesting and imaginative.<BR>It's a light read in my opinion with surprising twists til the very end.

That's what makes this a wonderful fresh story of personalities in the Bible.<BR>Michal sees and falls in love with David at a very young age. They married, he told her promises that weren't fullfilled in her eyes which made her bitter.Many years later, after Michal is marries to a very nice, even-tempered man,Phalteil, David has Michal taken from her home and brought back to him. He &quot;re-claims&quot; her as his wife and she does not go down without a fight. She narrates about a different David than I remember but it's easy to see why she feels the way she does. King David is very cunning and has a roving eye. Enter Bathsheba......and Uriah's murder.....and Bathsheba's pregnancy.....the deaths of David's sons.....the birth of Solomon( I loved that part)..... the lack of supervision by David of his household.<BR>This book is excellent! The descriptive writing of Michal's courtyard was awesome. I could feel the hot weather. I could hear the fountains. I could almost even see the stars in the clear night sky.<BR>Great book....Great writing....I'm eagerly looking for another book by this author.

There is so much more to this book than I could possibly write in this review and oh, so very much to read in between the lines. This is such a &quot;real and could be in your neighborhood&quot; story. There is no exaggerated, descriptive writing and no unbelievable situations. <BR>Some of this story....actually a lot of this story is sad and will almost rip your heart out. Kate and Tyler's mother died of breast cancer at the beginning of the girls' teen years, a difficult time to start with. The loneliness this causes them is heartbreaking. They miss their &quot;normal&quot; life tremendously. Their father, Davis, doesn't handle the loss of his wife very well at all. He finds a woman to fill that void in his life and basicly moves in with her, letting Kate and Tyler live alone in the house on the cul-de-sac in a well-to-do neighborhood with it's upper class residents. Davis feels that his daughters are old enough to take care of themselves with him stopping in a few times a week. 17 year old Kate also fills her void and loneliness the wrong way and ends up pregnant and scared and not sure where to turn. 15 year old Tyler takes on a lot of responsibility and is mature beyond her years. She cares for her sister, delivers a baby at home, and much more.<BR>There is so much more to this story and this book would be one of the best discussion stories I've ever read.<BR>I highly recommend reading this book. It is hard to put down and has such a wonderful easy to read flow. Oh, and there is some suspense here! Who is the father? Watch how all of the lives twist and change. A person's death or a person's birth can change so many lives in some of the strangest ways. Some good and some not so good.<BR>I absolutrly LOVED this novel. Excellent writing. I like to read a book that I don't have to study to know who is who and what's going on. This one starts off great and keeps getting better. There are even little side twists that could turn out to be very good stories also. GREAT BOOK :-)	2001-10-30

Please Ms. Rolens, write some more. You're a terrific author!!<BR>The story is about family love.....unconditional love. The earl and mid 20th century is rich with history and this author ties history into this novel with expertise rolled up with suspense.<BR>There's the primitive childbirth practices which caused the death of 14 year old Chastity. Her baby boy, Cappy, being raised by his grandparents and the loved shared between them is heartwarming. And Worthy's love for Willa is so very obvious as well as Willa's love for him in return.<BR>There is everything in this book that is in real life. Some hate, some love, some patriotism, some strange personal endeavors, bullies and meaness. <BR>I belive almost anyone would like this book, I don't understand why anyone would be embarassed about a book of fiction. THIS IS A GREAT BOOK. Pick it up, read it, enjoy it, life isn't always picture perfect.<BR>This story was easy to follow and easy to get to know the characters. I highly recommend this one.	2001-10-17

It's a story of a young 5th grade girl that experiences  absolutly too much abuse and ridicule in her life. The book, Ellen Foster, portrays a girl that  is a survivor of neglect, alcoholism, and poverty. Ellen is a very strong child that witnesses racism and is inadvertantly a victim of the same. She doesn't succomb to selfpity, she is a tough cookie that focuses on her &quot;new mama&quot; and &quot;foster&quot; family.<BR>I really enjoyed reading this book. It's a story told by Ellen using the language of an 11 year old telling her sad life story as she understands it.<BR>I do recommend this book to all of my friends, it actually reminds me a lot of &quot;White Oleander&quot;, another book that I thoroughly enjoyed.	2001-10-11

What I really liked about this book was how much I learned about treasure-trove, deep sea diving, marine biology and all of this done in a very interesting, fast paced dialog. This book is so good that the scenery description made me feel the breeze through the sea air. I would say that this story was somewhat predictable but so is the birth of a child or graduation from college and all of that is still exciting. But, I do want to say that there is a bit of a surprise near the end.....a big surprise. <BR>Pick up this book, it'll be worth your while....it's very interesting, very entertaining, adventurous, romantic, with a touch of mystique and loads of suspence. <BR>You'll truely enjoy this book..	2001-10-10

The first 3/4 of this novel was dry and very hard to follow, in my opinion. The last few chapters were real interesting and enjoyable to read, so instead of 1 star, I gave this book 2 stars. <BR>This novel seemed like a survey, of sorts, about relationships, commitment, and love between different couples of different generations. That was interesting but I find it hard to enjoy a book that is so difficult to know which couple is narrating, since it switched back and forth alot.<BR>This is not one of my favorites and it's not a book that I tell my friends &quot;you just have to read this&quot;.<BR>Based on the other reviewers, I'm in the minority with my review. I do admire authors that will step out on a limb and write a little bit differently. I liked the story but I wasn't fond of the way the book was written.	2001-10-03

She is full of love and improves the lives of the people she comes in contact with that let her be herself. I guess I would say that this is basicly a story of a ditsy blond and her friend, the New Yorkish cabbie. These two people are so different but actually so alike in certain ways.<BR>This is a sweet book and a real joy to read and follow Belle through the story as she learns to be more independent and less frightened of life.<BR>Any of us women should feel blessed if we have just a little bit of Belle in us. I know I'm glad I got to meet her and get to know her.<BR>You won't regrett reading this book. It's a &quot;feel-good&quot; read. :-}	2001-09-30

It's the first James Patterson book I've read, so unlike a lot of other reviewers, I didn't expect it to be any other type of story. Don't let the first sentence in my review fool you, there's alot of sad times and maybe even some tears. This author surely went out on a limb and created a story very different from his others and that only proves what a talent he really is.<BR>I loved the way J. Patterson wrote the end of this book. Very intriguing and imaginative.<br />Do yourself a favor and read this book, but don't expect it to mirror his last one. That's why you need to read this one, because it is different from his norm and it's very, very good.<br />It's a story about how life can really throw a curve when it's least expected and sometimes we aren't ready to catch that curveball and it will hit the ol' bread basket, knock the wind out of us as well as knock us off our feet. It's a story of healing and resilence. It's a story of real life. This book is worth adding to your collection.	2001-09-21

It's a story of a daughter, Amy, who has a destuctive infatuation towards one of her high school teachers. It's also a story of a mother that learns to be more in tune with her daughter and realizing that Amy will make some mistakes and hopefully learn from them like Isabelle, the mother, has learned from hers.<BR>I liked the way the author would write in tidbits of happenings across town in someone else's life in the middle of the main scene in a chapter or paragraph.<BR>This book has a great storyline. I didn't see the TV movie but I can understand why it was such a hit.<BR>I believe any mother would enjoy this book and most probably a lot of fathers.

I read this book and took this course many years ago and I've read the book many times since. This book can only help a person be a better wife, husband, parent, employee, employer, neighbor, doctor, teacher, etc., etc., etc. Even if someone were a recluse, this book would help them to be kinder to themself.<br />We hear of &quot;road-rage&quot;.....people needing selfcontrol.....people hating their jobs. I know a few people that think they just aren't &quot;people&quot; people but this book will help anyone feel a little more in control and a lot less intimidated when dealing with others.<br />This book is not only for sales and it's definitely not a book to teach manipulation of others just for the benefit for one's self.To have better employees or children, influencing them is far better than ordering them. Influencing someone tends to work without supervision.<br /><br />This is a book of learning to be optimistic and caring of others. Excellent book. This publication will NEVER be outdated. I challenge anyone reading my review to read this book and to see and feel how good this book really is. As a matter of fact, I read 5 novels a month and How To Win Friends.......is going to be one of those books this month........again  :-}	2001-09-10

Her mother dies when Jorie and her 2 brothers are very young to be cared for by a father who is a very busy family physician, never knowing when he'll get to go home or when he might be called out for an emergency or child birth. He's a father that in my opinion is rather selfish at times, putting his life first mainly through his profession. There's no hugs and kisses passed around as well as very fe, if any, compliments to the children. The children grow up with a wide range of housekeepers/caretakers with some pretty sad treatment from some resulting with bruises and dangerous rides in cars as well as the boys being tied up to their bed posts or put in closets.<BR>This is an incredibule book and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Every page was interesting. There's only one other book, White Oleander, I ever read that is similar in the respect of very young children fighting all odds and being survivors who use their upbringing in the &quot;school-of-hard-knocks&quot; to their advantage in adulthood.<BR>In a nutshell, this is a story of a single parent doing the best job he knew how to do. He's a good father and provider but he's not a good &quot;mother&quot; at all. He leaves a lot of emotions unspoken as well as no &quot;motherly&quot; advice.<BR>GREAT BOOK.......Read it, you won't be disappointed.	2001-09-04

Very gripping. An under privileged young woman from an immigrant family who always puts other before herself.....or maybe that's not true.....oh, wait, yes it is---I think. That's how my mind was working as I read this book. I almost burned steaks on the grill because this story volleys back and forth so intriguingly.<br />This will give another way to look at the political game during election campaigning.<br />If you like suspense and reading something to keep you on the edge of your seat and reading til you fall asleep at 2am only to wake up at 6 to start reading again....this is the one. If the author's other book, The Trophy Wife, is as good as this.....I will be amazed.	2001-09-04

I like books with more bite and awe to the story. I can't get interested in a story of a 50something woman who's wondering what happened to the girl of her youth; and also wondering what her life would be like if she chose the other road in her journey through life. She's not unhappy, she's just curious. She loves her family, she lives in a house that belonged to her in-laws and she works at a career that makes  her be a person that she really isn't deep down inside................Well, heck....................That book's main character sounds like me......and my enjoyment of reading is the escape from reality it affords me while sitting in my Broyhill with my 2 chihuahuas curled up on my lap, my favorite CD playing. <br />The book has excellent writing and cute storylines, but not for me. Give me some kind of wierdness or dysfunction laced through my reading.	2001-09-02

What a terrific group of people to &quot;meet&quot; and easily get to know. This story takes place in the row houses in Little Itlay in NY. The author does a great job of making the reader feel like part of the &quot;family&quot; of neighbors and tight-knit family. Reading this book was like sitting on the front stoop with these characters catching up on the neighborhood gossip. There are the old world Italians that are actually from Italy and this particular group stick with old customs and beliefs and don't wander to far from Little Italy. Then there are the young, new Italians born in Little Italy but tend to wander out of the neighborhood and meet new friends not from Little Italy or even Italian. We get to meet the overbearing, Italian mother of a son who has a hard time being independent or even wanting to be independent. This story made me laugh at times. I wouldn't call this a comedy, I'd call this a look at a different ethnic culture but also being able to recognize someone familiar. This was an excellent book and story with a lot of people to enjoy. A fun education of &quot;the old ways&quot;.	2001-09-02

I knew this book would be good, especially after I read Sheri's Rapture of Canaan, which was excellent. Bitteroot Landing is a bittersweet type of story because it's about incest and the sad effects on a person's life. Once I started reading this book, I couldn't set it down because I loved and cried for Jael and i was so concerned about her. The situations and conditions that she lived though were horrific. The story starts when Jael is a very young girl dealing with a &quot;loving&quot; but vicious, mean, domineering Mammie----the word &quot;loving&quot; being used very, VERY loosely. She runs away for safety but life doesn't get a whole lot better. She ends up living wild; as in wild animals fending for themselves. As she grows older, she takes advice from the spirits that are around her. There is so much more to this story and I'm not that great at writing reviews, but I do know that this is a terrific story and the author wrote it with such an easy readable flow. This is one of my favorites for sure.<br />I feel that almost anyone would like this book and I highly recommend reading it. The story is a real eye-opener to the harshness of life in some very sad situations.	2001-08-23

I recommend everybody read this little gem of a book that's filled with truth and is essential for any &quot;type A&quot; personality. It's a cute biblical story that is made up of serious life-lessons aimed towards properity.........NOT just money, but anything pertaining to self; ie: time, love, health, savings, possessions, income, etc. I used to own and run 3 retail stores with subcontractors, sales clerks, bookkeepers, service routes, product education seminars, on, and on and on. After reading this book, I realized that my time and health is as valuable as the money brought in, which a lot of times was paid out for overhead. I still own the same company, but I've geared WAY DOWN. It was a hard decision to make and I prayed real hard about what and how to do. We actually now live in a bigger house, enjoy each other more, and are a lot happier about life.......Amazing what reading a tiny little book can do for a life! The point of this story is to work smart and to put yourself first-----Oh, I still hate to say that-----because that's how you'll be more prosperous and more helpful to your family, friends, and all others.<br />It's a short, quick book and I highly recommend reading it.	2001-08-20

Some children aren't vocal or artistic or self-starters or detail oriented and never will be no matter how often they're ridiculed or put in time-out or made to feel inadiquat. It's time for me to get off of my soapbox now, but this is a wonderful book and I recommend everyone to read it. It'll make you understand that a child...as well as any human being...has a way that they react and for any of us not to take reactions so personally...............after all, that's their personality ;-}	2001-08-16

They get together in one of their attics and made a time-capsule, of sorts, by writing their dreams down on paper and inserting them into a blue bottle. They &quot;hide&quot; this bottle in the rafters of the attic and essentially forgot about it because of major life events in all of their lives. The bottle was discovered when the demolition crew started tearing the house down over 3 decades later. This story shows how the depression affected different families in very different ways, all being very traumatic. This book deals with lost dreams, suicide, mental depression and breakdown, lost love, realized dreams, forgiveness, fake Christians, and so much more.  I enjoyed this book because it made me realize how sometimes we take our eyes off of what's important and when that happens, everything gets cofused and doesn't seem to gel right. This book also educated me, in a way, about the stock market crash and the depression. Very enjoyable eventhough sad at times....but isn't that how life is?	2001-08-09

I don't want to give any part of the story away so I just want to say it's an adoreable story of basicly 2 families of different religious backgrounds set in the 1960s through the '80s/90s and the changing mind set of different generations. There are a lot of Yiddish words and customs woven through the story. It's a great book, it's educational in certain ways, and at times it will make you laugh. The characters are very real and when I finished this book, I felt like I just returned from a visit with these folks. This story touches on prejudice beliefs that are instilled by &quot;old&quot; thinking. The light and humorous way that the author handles the situations is what really makes you want to laugh because it's easy to picture these ideas and things really happening and how ridiculous it is. A very good book and one that can be read quickly. A joy to read.	2001-08-03

This story is so gripping and SO interesting, that it's almost impossible to set it down when you start reading. This book will grab you right from the beginning and will keep a toe-hold on you til you finish because it is such a different setting and story. It's hard enough to be a teenager and a senior in high school along with being the star football player. It's also not easy being the son of the town's sherrif, who incidently drinks too much and has an unpredictable, aggressive, and at times a violent personality. Neil also is growing up wondering where his mother is and why she left him with his father instead of taking him with her so he wouldn't have to live with such a combustile dad. This story has so much going for it and so many &quot;little&quot; storylines that tie together ever so amazingly. Just read this book and watch what happens when a group of teenagers attend a &quot;beer party&quot;, drink way too much, say and do things to their friends that can't be taken back or reversed. I enjoyed this book eventhough it is a disturbing story, but it is one that will make the reader think.	2001-08-01

Ninah, always wanted to do what was right in the eyes of the religion she was brought up in but she also didn't understand why the &quot;right&quot; choices only seemed to pertain to the commune she lived in and not for everyone at school. She made some wrong choices but could justfy them as right choices because she prayed about her dilemas and she felt that God answered her prayers with the decision she chose. Actually there are a lot of people that do the same thing in real life.  This book will NOT disappoint you if you choose to read it. It is fiction but it is such an education of religious fanatics and the demeaning punishments that are put upon sins or mistakes made. Excellent book with much, much more story twists than I've mentioned..........teen pregnancy, entering high school, questioning religion, suicide, commune living and sharing wages earned, and a lot more. Like I said.....EXCELLENT BOOK. It will make you think.	2001-07-18

I love every book I've ever read by this author because she is such a great adjective artist that I feel the surroundings that she describes as well as the people in the story. This book is about a woman that starts her young life married to a man she thinks she can help and lets him have the excuse of being a war veteran to explain why he's not-quite-the-man he could be. Nora isn't the perfect mother that she wanted to be and her one daughter, Ruby, rubs salt in that wound any chance she gets. This story is so relatable for any family member because we all have done things while raising our children or to our spouse that hind-sight would've saved a lot of hurt feelings. I certainly think this is a wonderful book to read and I guaranty will be enjoyed. The setting of Summer Island is so refreshing and peaceful---a great place for Eric to be as well as Nora and Dean and Ruby; all for their own special needs.	2001-07-18

This story is so &quot;real life&quot;.The characters are so easy to identify with as well as the jobs they have and the businesses they own. Life and love aren't always fair or easy to deal with, and this book touches on all of those things as well as the wonderful way the author describes the landscape and surroundings.

A sensational book about a man with multiple personalities and his court appointed psychiatrist who, unfortunitely for her, is a natural strawberry blond.

There are soooo many twists and turns to see what happens next. You'll hate \\"Max\\" but you'll love him too//or at least like him. It's almost understandable why \\"Max\\" is the mean cold-hearted person that he has matured to be when the story describes his sexual and mental abuse by his own parents,,,,oh, but he's saved and taken in by a caring person just to be used and adused again. What a magnificent book!!! Do yourself a favor and read this, you will NOT be disappointed....horrified and a bit taken by surprise by some of the goings-on,,,,but definitely NOT disappointed.....It'll keep you turning the pages for sure.<BR>This story is eerie,creepy, and chilling to say the least.<BR>I am most assuredly going to read more of this author's work.

It's a story about a sister and a brother and their young dependence on each other for comfort. The father is hard to explain, but I'm glad I didn't have one like him. He teased and picked on the kids, especially the brother because he wanted him tough like a boy and not a sissy who liked to draw or enjoy music. The downward psychological spiral of the brother was evident. The mother's &quot;escape&quot; was her faith, religion, and her job. The sister's &quot;escape&quot; was her depression, music, and her grandmother. The brother fell into the clutches of his paranoid father. There is a lot more to this story and I recommend reading it. I enjoyed it. It's a story that can emotionally shake you.The story of a young, disturbed boy who turns up missing and the maturing of his sister into womanhood constantly wondering about her brother.	2001-06-26

This story is so very different than anything I've ever read. The basic undertone of this story is a mother's love for her child. Elijah is deathly ill and knocking at death's door when his mother, Dinah, makes a &quot;deal&quot; with a ghost to save her son. This ghost is actually a demon and makes life difficult for Dinah, even unbearable at times. There are a lot of deep lessons in this book, and most of them are the type that none of us like to face; like the acceptance of the eventual death of a young son. Dinah fights that event and never has peace until she does accept that her son is not going to live a long, beneficial, and normally healthy life. The trauma of a fatal illness and the way it effects a marriage is another scene played out in this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone. This is definitely a page turner and one of the best books I've read. <br />This is a very different kind of story. I truely think it would be a great movie because of the story angles and because it is very unique and imaginative. Excellent!!	2001-06-18

This is one of those books that made me feel like I knew these people and that I could actually experience the emotions stirred up by this story. This story gave me a better understanding of ALS/ Lou Gerhig's Disease. A very good book, easy to read and finish because it's so interesting right from the beginning, and the people are so &quot;real&quot;. There's a teenage daughter that has to watch her mother go through her terminal illness, and the author made her so real to life. Excellent book......Pick this one up and read it, you'll most definitely enjoy it and learn from it. There was so much more to this story than an illness though. An almost exhusband who finally opened his heart to love. That part of this book is so touching. Another thing this book did is make me realize how a person's past can form the future if allowed. This is such a great story about much more than a terminally ill wife/mother/daughter. She's got spunk, hope, and faith.	2001-06-04

This book brought back so many of my childhood memories of learning from my Polish &quot;bubchi&quot;/grandmother. I loved this book for that reason because my Polish mother passed away when I was 6 and my new stepmother a few years later would not allow any contact. I devoured this book! It was like a trip back in time. I forgot all about the traditional Christmas meal and the strict Catholic core. I can't say enough about this book. It's a great story to read and anyone can relate to it since America is made up of lots and lots of immigrants. A lot of the book is actually about the new generations wanting to &quot;be different&quot; and break away from tradition, wanting to be &quot;themselves&quot; and not just an extention of mom, grandmom, or great-grandmom. But it's hard to escape something when it's a part of a person and this book is about about that trip. <br />And to the author......Thank you for writing this book. You gave things back to me that I didn't even know I lost. I can hear my grandmother's broken English, I can smell her cooking, I can feel her love for me. Like the book says...I'm a Polish daughter.	2001-06-04

It's kind-of like a fictional story/plot of Men are from Mars- Women are from Venus. I've been married over 21 years, and this fictional book made me realize--Hey, he's just like that, don't take it so personal. The pregnancy and child birth brought back so many memories that I laughed at but way back then--I didn't think were so funny. And the parts about being the mother of a toddler....very true. really a fun book and makes light of serious-real-life situations--the way we should all be to start with. It sure put me in a better frame of mind on the homefront. Just plain fun to read. I sure needed it after reading a very depressing Oprah pick.	2001-05-02

I did like the way the author educated us readers to the ways of the old world while also portraying how some modern-day people live.

I have read most of Oprah's Book Club books and this one is as good as or maybe even better than most of them. There's the suppressed women jobs of working in a pickle factory for a terrible boss. There is the lecturous older men praying on the young girls tricking them to allow him to take porno pictures. There's the teens and young adults that are struggling with life and their religious upbringing. There's the headshops, smoking pot, drag racing, psychedelic art, mini skirts, guys beginning to wear their hair long, long straight hair on the girls, Volkswagens, the Vietnam war and alot of other &quot;happenings&quot; that tags the time of this story to the turbulent '60s. This author mentions places in Vietnam as well as situations and she is right on the money. I can't praise this book enough. If you like Oprah's Picks or relationship sagas, you will most assuredly devour this book. I graduated from high school in '69 and my husband served in the Army during the Vietnam war and served 1 1/2 years in the jungles in Vietnam and this book helped me to understand some of the things he witnessed and lived through. Believe it or not, this book is fun at times and fast paced. It's such an easy book to stay interested in and involved in because there are so many different things going on and tied together by a mystery, of sorts. The ending is out-a-sight, to use a '60s term. Pick this book up and read it. It's SO good. I just can't believe it's not promoted more by someone, if not Oprah. It's EXCELLENT.	2001-03-11

The little boy, Luke being the narrator is what made this story so good and absolutely fun to read. There are 2 or 3 parts that made me laugh so hard that I had tears in my eyes!! When the &quot;city girl&quot; came to visit with her new husband, Luke's uncle, and she got terrified by a garden snake----it was hilarious the way that Luke reacted with his boyhood innocence. He just could not believe she'd be so upset. Luke possessed curiousity that caused him to see or hear things that were terrifying and mystifying. Murder, violence, child birth, family love and tradition and so much more was a part of this book. Once you get reading and past the first chapter, it's near impossible to put the book down. Excellent. Don't pass up the chance to read this one.	2001-02-28

I thoroughly enjoyed this book and to be quite honest, I was so surprised how easily it flowed and I absolutely could not put it down. I put off reading this book because I figured it would be a bit hard to understand, a little like reading the Bible. Do yourself a favor and pick this book up and read it. The fellowship of these women is very interesting to read about. There's jealousy, revenge, and cattiness---believe it or not. There's also love, romance, caring, tenderness and also some of the nastiness in life, such as physical and sexual abuse, abortion, and even neglect of the less than perfect newborns. This book has brought a lot of understanding to me about the biblical and ancient times. What a tremendous role the women played as a &quot;single unit&quot;. GREAT BOOK. It's surely a book that, once it's read, it will never be forgotten. I'd give it better than a 5 star rating if I could. I will read more from this author for sure.	2001-02-16

I couldn't really thoroughly read those parts of the story because They were way too detailed for me. But as for the basic story, it was very good. The last 2 chapters were SO GOOD. The ending of this book was exceptional. Bret Lott always writes books with the kind of plots that make you really think about the characters' situations.

This is the second review I wrote, I don't know what happened to the first one. There are family secrets that come out because of hypnotism and the family being brought together by illness and a funeral. Really this story is about some very serious matters but Lee Smith wrote from a lighthearted angle which makes th reader laugh at a lot of the situations. I wouldn't call this book &quot;dark&quot; at all even though it could've very easily been written that way. I liked this book a lot and to think I almost didn't read it because of some of descriptions in some of the negative reviews. Read this book, it's very good. It's about real life and sometimes real life isn't very pretty. There are many people that are raised by their parents and then find out in their adult life that these wonderful people that raised them aren't actually their parents. Their &quot;sister&quot; or &quot;Aunt So-and-so&quot; is their real mother. This is really a good book and it's written from the perfect perspective, with a touch of humor.	2001-02-04

He was reduced to a basic survivalist at such a young, tender age. Maggie didn't know who to trust and there are no clues while reading this book to let you know who Maggie can trust. But at the end, the odd, twisted and demented kidnapper will surprise you. This book will keep you on the edge of your seat and keep you guessing. Very, very good story.

Oh, and the news that the media prints isn't always true and isn't that &quot;history&quot;? This book does get tedious at times but it's definitely worth reading, I know I have thought about this book of fiction/fantasy off and on for the past few decades.

This book does NOT promote the &quot;love&quot; of money but it explains why you shouldn't feel guilty because you are prosperous. The Bible promotes prosperity as well as helping others. Plus, being rich doesn't just mean having a lot of money. this book talks about being rich in all aspects of life. It's the &quot;love&quot; of money that is evil just like the &quot;love&quot; of food is what makes us fat. Does that mean that food is bad? Get this book and read it....you'll gain new understanding of wealth.<br />Read this book, it will show you how being prosperous only benefits everything and everybody. It only makes sense. Poor people can't help poor people. Higher income areas of our country have the higher paid teachers and the best schools and the best SAT scores. That's only one example.

This book is a must if you deal with the public at all. I hope my comments have been helpful but there is so much more to this book than what I have written but my main point is that you will enjoy it, it's very easy to understand and it will be a benefit to read. It has helped me be less stressed out with rude sales people and/or service people because there's even a chapter on them to help us all understand each other.<br />A great book, don't miss the chance to read it.

Don't miss the chance to read this book. It's so sweet to feel the closeness of the women and be &quot;next to them&quot; as they age but it's also sad to feel the bad times they also went through. As I already shared, this is an excellent book. I now live in S.C. but I'm fromm Pa., this story has made me understand a lot of things that I never experienced and used to have a hard time believing really happened, but I am the eternal optimist wearing rose colored glasses. Great story and it's one that you can get right into.	2001-01-11

Back in the fifties when a teenage girl got herself &quot;in trouble&quot;, she &quot;had to&quot; get married and deal with the rest of her life as well as be a good mother. Well that's exactly what this story is about. There are some very good messages in this story and is very worth reading as well as enjoyable since the author leaned a little bit towards the comical look at life. The husband's close relationship to an ex-girlfriend is enough to make any of us female, married readers want to slap him or her. The end of this story is SO imaginative and surprising. Get this book, you'll enjoy it and it's a quick moving easy read.	2001-01-04

I live in the Charleston area, and this author definitely has the lowcountry pegged. At times Myrtle Beach is swarming with teenagers and young adults and this mystery is SO interesting that it's hard to put the book down because the action is never held up with overly descriptive, boring paragraphs. Chase, the PI who lives at the marina, is so believably real as well as the storyline is. The lowcountry &quot;aristocrat&quot; O'Keys family is so interesting. I liked the book a lot and the flow of the story made this a quick page turning read. Jenny's overbearing mother is a piece of work. This one will keep you reading til you're through so don't plan on getting anything else done once you start this book:-}	2001-01-01

Just think about it......some people actually live like this :-{   I really liked this book, but I don't like ooey-gooey, finger in the cheek dimple kind of stories because they are SO unreal. This poor family's life was turned upside-down when the husband lost his job and his ambition and forced a move into his parents home. His parents were resentful of this and that set the tone for the house. The children endured negative situations that they will carry the rest of their lives. The story doesn't have a happy ending in the typical sence, but it does have a happy ending in a different kind of way. I liked the book a lot and if you enjoy reading a story that is thought prevoking, this is definitely worth reading and you will enjoy it.	2000-12-31

As I was reading, I just KNEW who really killed Vincie's father/the hard working farmer. And then I started realizing it wasn't that person but I was then thinking: PLEASE DON'T BE THIS PERSON! And the anguish that pour Vincie was going though wondering why and who could have done this. The descriptive writing about the Vermont area with the die-hard working families and how stern our ancestors were. It's easy to see my predescessors in these hardworking, serious people. I loved this book and recommend it to all.	2000-12-28

JW and Zee and their children are so refreshing. After reading the book, I feel like I've actually met them. And Corrie is such a laid back old soul--I loved him. This wonderful author doesn't overdo the detective into some kind of super-motcho man--JW is an everyday kind of guy with a family that he also has time for; his career just happens to be looking for evidence and then putting it together and come up with a solution.    The story involves college students rooming in houses that are not kept up by the landlord. He owns the houses for the profit made on them. Some of the college students get a little too rapped up in their partying and sometimes revenge to each other. Then throw in arson and there's a story to make you read til you find out if it's arsen or fate and who's behind it all--if anyone is.     Really a super story. The author keeps you reading because you're always &quot;just about to find out more&quot;.	2000-12-20

I didn't like the way the story jumped around SO much. Also it seemed like a bit too much jibber-jabber. But it actually was a good story and written from such a different angle; maybe if the ending would have been as &quot;different&quot; and extreme, it would have made me feel better about reading the book. This book took me longer to read than almost any book I've read. It's definitely not a page turner in my opinion.	2000-12-17

I had to re-read paragraphs to get a grip on the story a little better but I assume the book reads like that because it was written so long ago using the &quot;language&quot; of that era. I read this along with my daughter as suggested by her English teacher. The book did spark conversation about the early 1900s and some of the &quot;symbolism&quot; in the story, which was enjoyable. It's a classic and worth reading but it's not what I call a page turner.	2000-11-23

Such a great writer and thank goodness she shared her knowledge of her homeland. I took this book with me on a cruise to the Virgin Islands and as we passed Haiti, I had the feeling of actually being there ONLY because of the details and customs and beliefs that the author wrote about. The culture and beliefs of the Haitian people were so real. This book opened a new door for me in the way of appreciating other lands. Thank you so much for writing this book----I enjoyed my &quot;trip&quot; to Haiti and I enjoyed the closeness of the women family members as well as the unchallenged respect for the elders. Wonderful book!!  Some of the primative practices and beliefs have adverse effects, as the book also shows. I don't want to say anything more direct because the beauty of reading this book is the education received about this culture. Again, this was truely enjoyable.	2000-11-09

It's funny how, as children, we imagine our parents a certain way----mainly because they are our guidance and our disciplinarians-----but when we are grown up and they let us see their true human events in their lives, it's at times crushing and at times comical and at times refreshing. This is a wonderful story, and as a 50 year old woman, I surely can relate to it as well as understand some of the perplexing attitudes and looks I get from my twin, 16 year old daughters.

When  she goes back home to escape the media, she eventually finds the comfort and loyalty of her hometown very essential and relaxing and finally understands what a privilege it is to live there. This story shows how ruthless the media can be as well as how the media can almost ruin lives by telling half truths. What made me buy this book was the beautiful dust jacket scene. Barbara Delinsky is a tremendous writer. This was the first book I read of hers and it made me read about 4 or 5 more--ALL of them very, very good, but Lake News is still my favorite. Lake News will make you realize the torment that famous people go through and will make you think twice about the news you read or hear. GREAT BOOK!!!!!!!	2000-10-11

A great story about a young girl growing up, maturing and chasing memories of a mother that left her at a young age. Very, very good story. Paige grows into a sweet and talented woman from the average everyday family that marries into a very wealthy family, much to her shagrin.She carries the burden of her mother's unexplained desertion by always thinking she's the cause of anything negative that happens in her life. This is a great story about a young, first-time mother and her uncertainty. Boy, I sure can identify with Paige when she's questioning where &quot;her&quot; life went. She's either Dr. Prescot's wife or Max's mom.Paige worked hard to get her husband through Harvard, then unexpectantly gets pregnant. During this time span is when she realizes she has lost her own identity.

There are so many very interesting mini stories  going on in this novel, that there's NO WAY you'll spend only 1 minutes in  the reading room. GREAT BOOK!	2000-08-27
