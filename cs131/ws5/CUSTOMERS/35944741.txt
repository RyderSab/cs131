Warner believes that these negative parental images are obscure, metaphorical, and atavistic visages from an early time, when overt and covert competition for immediate survival amongst family members was a terrifying fact of daily life.<br /><br />Warner suggests that while most parents may today fulfill the required roles of guardian, nurturer, and provider in most cases most of the time, every adult has the inherent potential to relinquish one or all of them, and become an abandoner at best, and a predator, child killer, or cannibal at worst.<br /><br />Not that Warner lets children off easily: like Camille Paglia, Warner refuses to see children as essentially benign, innocent, and tender-hearted. Warner sees infancy in particular as a time of \\"unappeasable demands and violent greed,\\" behavior which, by a strange but spontaneous circularity, is often the very behavior by which \\"ogres and giants--and cannibal witches\\" are defined. Thus, part of the reason such tales exist and are read to impressionable children is because the stories teach their young audiences to recognize and reject their own worst personal and social inclinations.<br /><br />Does the human need to eat, and thus destroy other life at some level, result in a continuous but little realized psychic cycle of guilt, self-loathing, anxiety, and horror for mankind, especially when commingled with incestuous familial entanglements?  Are we all 'monsters' of some kind at some level? In a hilarious but acute look at the present-day \\"American identity,\\" the author perceives many Americans as \\"pillowy and flaccid and fluffy and fat, like babies,\\" members of a \\"generalized cult of childishness, a widespread, let's pretend infantilism\\" which \\"then fosters the image of the monster babies: they  have something which we lack, which we desire. Baby envy has eclipsed penis envy.\\"<br /><br />Warner also deftly illustrates how Freud's Oedipal theory, in which the young male child secretly desires to destroy the father with whom he feels competitive, is the direct inverse of the ogre's desire to devour his children and thus, Kronos-like, eliminate any competition his offspring may represent in the years to follow. Thus while the son, partially projecting a sense of his own unacceptable instincts, sees the father as the \\"child-guzzler,\\" the father may perceive his child as a life-sucking parasite that may rob him of his future, drain away his vitality, and one day assume his place and position if something isn't done to prevent it.<br /><br />The profusely illustrated 'No Go The Bogeyman' features wonderfully erudite commentary on an enormous number of diverse subjects, including the myths surrounding Kronos, the Cyclops, Scylla, and Circe, Goethe's poem 'The Erkling,' the artwork of Goya, Hieronymus Bosch, Caravaggio, Jacque-Louis David, William Hogarth, Gustave Dore, Richard Dadd, and Henri Rousseau, Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books, Dante's Divine Comedy, Punch & Judy shows, Beatrix Potter's 'The Tale of Samuel Whiskers,' Maurice Sendak's 'Where the Wild Things Are,' 1933's 'King Kong,' Bigfoot legends in America, David Lynch's 'Blue Velvet' (1986), Josephine Baker, Carmen Miranda, Halloween celebrations, and Carnival.some level?

Thomas Steele's definitive '1000 Clowns: More or Less: A Visual History of the American Clown' (2004) offers abundant evidence that professional clowning may represent the ultimate in alternative lifestyles.<br /><br />Though playful behavior is, of course, found in some higher animals, the human activity of professional clowning is always a highly artificial process enacted within a specifically structured framework, thus making the clown a legitimate, knowing, and complexly-organized insider who nonetheless often essays the role of eternal outsider.<br /><br />Clowns are 'betwixt and between' liminal creations whose behavior simultaneously reflects experience and innocence, callousness and sensitivity, seductiveness and repulsion, sincerity and deception. Whether performing in the center spotlight or merely acting as a diversion for another act, the clown is always on stage and constantly negotiating the space between the objective world of his audience and his own very private channels of perception, spontaneity, insight, and response. The truly successful clown becomes an autonomous personage, a \\"demigod of the sawdust\\" who subtly persuades his audience to forget the unknown human factor beneath the facade.<br /><br />The gorgeous visuals in '1000 Clowns'--which are categorized under \\"Photography,\\" \\"Film & Television,\\" \\"Paintings,\\" \\"Graphics,\\" \\"America's Clowns,\\" and \\"Clowns In Movies\\"--underscore the fact that those clowns that appear bizarre, repulsive, and grotesque, such as those that appear on pages 114-116, are typically those with badly designed or haphazardly applied makeup. The stronger the design, artifice, and illusion, the more attractive and desirable the clown; some historical examples presented here include Lou Jacobs, Harry Dann, Felix Adler, Emmett Kelley, \\"Chucko the Birthday Clown,\\" and baby boomer favorite Bozo.<br /><br />1000 Clowns wisely focuses on the classic high period of the American circus, which, uncoincidentally, also coincided with the high point of Twentieth Century American culture.also coincided with the high point of Twentieth Century American culture.	2005-10-11

Quirk's Norma: 'The Story of Norma Shearer' (1988), and John Gilmore's 'Severed: The True Story of the Black Dahlia Murder' (1998), life near the power centers of the entertainment industry during Hollywood's Golden Age wasn't any less desperate a place than it is today.<br /><br />At first glance, Robert Hofler's 'The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson: The Pretty Boys and Dirty Deals of Henry Willson' (2005) appears to be little more than another lowbrow show business expose, but Hofler is actually providing a service by responsibly shedding some badly-needed light into the darker corners of the American psyche. One of the book's themes is the sociology of the American Dream: Hofler examines a world where physical desire and the hunger for power meet and intertwine freely.<br /><br />Broadly stated, 'The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson' concerns the lengths many now well-known men were willing to go to be given an opportunity at stardom.  For a great number, this meant repeatedly spending time on the homosexual casting couch, regardless of what their own public persona, sexual orientation, or marital status might be. 'The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson' supports the idea that yesterday's gossip and scandal is often presages today's historical record.<br /><br />While the book focuses on Willson, Hofler makes it clear that he was only one of many Hollywood agents and talent scouts who typically found the average handsome young man on the California streets more than willing to climb into his bed in return for even a slight industry favor. Hofler underscores that, once his reputation was established, Willson was not always the initiator; while he freely exploited his clients, he was also actively pursued by men who offered their bodies to him freely. At the height of Willson's power, which endured for decades, the problem was not too few willing candidates, but too many: one witness recalls the line of male hopefuls trailing down the stairs of the agent's second floor office and continuing down the block.<br /><br />Despite the publication and notoriety of 'The Kinsey Report on Male Sexuality' in 1948, most Americans of the era remained ignorant about same sex relationships; many were unable to conceive of how such a relationship was possible or could be enacted physically. Supporting Kinsey's conclusions, Hofler provides abundant evidence that there was indeed a much wider range of sexual behavior occurring between males of the period than generally assumed, especially among the ambitious and the opportunistic.<br /><br />Thus, ironically, the idols of millions of teenaged girls, as well as many of the ruggedly handsome heroes of television westerns of the Fifties and Sixties, who were the masculine role models for American men and boys everywhere, were actually both Willson's clients and his sexual partners.<br /><br />The difference between 'The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson' and similar books is that Hofler names names, and names names hand over fist. Hofler is unafraid to refer to Cary Grant, Randolph Scott, and Caesar Romero as  \\"homosexuals,\\" or follow the meandering path of a sexual relationship between Guy Madison and Rory Calhoun, going so far as to inform readers which man was the physically dominant partner and which the submissive.<br /><br />Like many of the men discussed, Troy Donahue seems to have lived in an uncomfortable state of liminal sexual orientation, but Hofler quotes him as admitting that he \\"got into a pile\\" at one of his agent's all-male orgies. A later passage describes a firsthand account in which Donahue, \\"zonked out of his mind,\\" is found hosting a \\"midday drug orgy\\" composed of \\"degenerates,\\" \\"degenerates\\" being standard code of the era for \\"homosexual.\\" Hilariously, Donahue's new bride, Suzanne Pleshette, files for divorce when she finds her spouse sneaking in \\"through the bathroom window at 5 a.m.\\"<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, those clients of Willson's who are still living, such as John Saxon and Mike Connors, state they were able to successfully fend off the agent's advances, or that no advances upon them were ever made, while evidence suggests that most of those who have passed away surrendered willingly or succumbed eventually.<br /><br />Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter, Anthony Perkins, Roddy McDowall, Farley Granger, George Nader, even Raymond Burr--not all of whom were Willson clients--Hofler tosses the idols of a generation on the fire. Other famous \\"Willson boys\\" included Alain Delon, John Gavin, Robert Fuller, Clint Walker, Van Williams, Guy Williams, and Chad Everett.<br /><br />Willson, who also arranged sham marriages, publicly betrayed those who had outlived their sexual usefulness, and threatened those who opposed him with extreme violence, is today as fondly remembered by some as he is loathed by others.<br /><br />'The Man Who Invented Rock Hudson' will make uncomfortable reading for those who would rather not know either the facts or the compromises that many of their childhood heroes made in the name of entertainment industry success. Readers will also have to decide whether the evidence presented is credible on a case by case basis.<br /><br />But Hofler's book, like the missing piece of a complex mosaic, balances out several equations, including the extreme and awkward stratification  between 'heterosexual' and 'homosexual' identities still presumed to exist today.te, files for divorce when she finds her spouse sneaking in \\"through the bathroom window at 5 a.m.\\"<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, those clients of Willson's who are still living, such as John Saxon and Mike Connors, state they were able to successfully fend off the agent's advances, or that no advances upon them were ever made, while evidence suggests that most of those who have passed away surrendered willingly or succumbed eventually.<br /><br />Rock Hudson, Tab Hunter, Anthony Perkins, Roddy McDowall, Farley Granger, George Nader, even Raymond Burr--not all of whom were Willson clients--Hofler tosses the idols of a generation on the fire.

US	35944741	R35SRS6270TDE8	382284585X	231386225	Halloween: Vintage Holiday Graphics (Icons)	Books	4	71	75	N	Y	Inviting The Autumn Muses	Jim Heimann's 'Halloween: Vintage Holiday Graphics' (2005) offers one of the best collections of Olde Halloween images yet available. Drawing material from postcards, paper decorations, magazines, advertisements, package labels, private period photographs, sheet music, masks, costumes, party favors, and other varied sources, the book offers almost two hundred pages of visionary iconography, that, for many, will definitely represent the very nature of the holiday itself.<br /><br />Among the more archetypal images: a vegetable man, three devils, and a caped witch enjoy a circular dance beneath an enormous watchful owl perched on a half moon; an androgynous child and black cat peering into a jack o' lantern as a transparent, green-skinned witch breezes by unseen overhead; and, appearing like the eternal outsider, a red-skirted witch gazes unnoticed through a window at a child's party, while a black cat, an owl, and an anthropomorphic moon observe her in turn.<br /><br />Traditional images of ghosts, scarecrows, bats, fairies, pumpkins, and human tricksters in colors of orange, black, white, and green predominate, though some of the images were clearly culled from the Fifties and Sixties, and thus the occasional helmeted spaceman or antenned robot appears. There is a  photograph of an adult blandly costumed as John F. Kennedy, another of a boy outlandishly dressed as television dolphin star Flipper, and, from an earlier era, bizarrely costumed manifestations of Mickey and Minnie Mouse courting one another out of doors.<br /><br />The book's only flaw lies in the thankfully brief and offensively misguided preface essay by Steven Heller, whose questionable credentials for contributing such a piece are nowhere in evidence. \\"It is hard to image a more paradoxical day of celebration than one where ghouls, warlocks, and zombies freely haunt the populace to their cold heart's content--an entire day dedicated to torment,\\" Heller begins, before immediately and awkwardly backtracking, though he continues to show little understanding of the nature of the holiday.<br /><br />In essence, Halloween has nothing to do with ghouls or zombies, and certainly nothing to do with \\"torment.\\" Readers with a broad and reaching knowledge of Halloween may also disagree with Heller's conclusion that \\"vampires, werewolves, and mummies\\"  are in any way fundamental to the holiday's \\"liturgy.\\"<br /><br />Nor, as Heller states, is Halloween essentially about \\"being scared out of one's wits.\\" Fear was merely the human byproduct incidentally produced by the supernatural agencies believed to freely walk the earth while the veil between worlds was at its weakest each All Hallows' Eve. Even the products of the American commercial haunted house industry, which manifest across the landscape during the fall, are rarely, if ever, frightening. Heller seems to have confused the contemporary vulgar corporate mindset, which panders to the increasing ignorance of the middle classes, with the genuine elements which characterize the holiday's pagan majesty and long traditions.<br /><br />As his essay completely ignores the period from which virtually all of the included images were taken, 'Halloween: Vintage Holiday Graphics' would have been a better book without Heller's contribution.cking, though he continues to show little understanding of the nature of the holiday.<br /><br />In essence, Halloween has nothing to do with ghouls or zombies, and certainly nothing to do with \\"torment.\\" Readers with a broad and reaching knowledge of Halloween may also disagree with Heller's conclusion that \\"vampires, werewolves, and mummies\\"  are in any way fundamental to the holiday's \\"liturgy.\\"<br /><br />Nor, as Heller states, is Halloween essentially about \\"being scared out of one's wits.\\" Fear was merely the human byproduct incidentally produced by the supernatural agencies believed to freely walk the earth while the veil between worlds was at its weakest each All Hallows' Eve.

US	35944741	RXS356L1AHE6O	078641524X	836013578	The Halloween Encyclopedia	Books	2	35	50	N	Y	Halloween's Goblin Universe Disenchanted	Like Jacqueline Simpson and Steve Roud's 'A Dictionary of English Folklore' ((2000), Lisa Morton's 'The Halloween Encyclopedia' (2003) represents a factually sound but poetically reductive examination of its subject. Both books sacrifice an inherent sense of wonder in the name of scholarly and/or academic respectability, with fairly sterile results, unlike, for instance, comparable works by British historian Ronald Hutton. The tone of Morton's text would be equally suitable to a handbook on carpentry or automobile repair.<br /><br />Morton's approach is doubly underscored by the unenthusiastic, almost parsimonious, design of the book: with very few exceptions, the illustrations, all of which are in black and white, are disappointing, uninviting, and undefinitive representations of their subjects. Considering the thousands of illuminating and visionary Halloween graphics available, those included suggest that Morton has little visual imagination whatsoever, and thus a probable weakness for interpreting the holiday's symbology.<br /><br />Importantly, Morton's visual failing crosses over to the book's text: for example, in several entries, Morton expresses perplexity about the meaning and relevance of scarecrows at Halloween: \\"The popularity of scarecrows as a Halloween symbol is something of an anomaly, since scarecrows are not practical in late October, when crops have already been harvested.\\" One might as well ask why images of snow and snowmen play such a large part in traditional Christmas iconography.<br /><br />Morton clearly understands--at least intellectually--that Halloween has undeniable agrarian roots and is partially a celebration of harvest; thus she should perceive that the scarecrow, on one level, represents the \\"autumn other\\" who, by proxy, presides like a vigilant demi-god over the stages of the agricultural cycle, which, of course, have traditionally culminated with Halloween. On the most basic level, scarecrows and snowmen are simply personifications of the seasons and holiday each represents. But, as human doppelgangers composed largely of vegetable matter, scarecrows are also 'betwixt and between' liminal figures of the highest order.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Morton's commentary often suggests that she is and always has been an urban dweller with little or no first-hand experience of country life. A leisurely road trip through the Midwest, New York State, and New England during August, September, and October might provide Morton with the broad insight she seems to lack.<br /><br />Elsewhere, many of Morton's entries seem sadly imbalanced. The entry for 'Guy Fawkes Night' is over six pages in length and 'Pranking' over four, while 'Devil' receives three meager paragraphs, and 'Ghosts,' only six paragraphs. Likewise, Latin America's 'Days Of The Dead' receives over four full pages of text, but 'Harvest' only two paragraphs. Some entries are padded with questionable material, such as the extraneous paragraph on Edgar Allen Poe's 'The Black Cat' which supplements the entry on 'Cats.'<br /><br />Morton has an easy appreciation for late twentieth century cultural products like John Carpenter's 'Halloween' (1979), but no apparent insight whatsoever into what the 'Jack-O'-Lantern' might have meant to twentieth century audiences, or might mean to celebrants of the present era. Is the American jack-o'-lantern of today merely a meaningless colored shell mechanically and thoughtlessly carved and placed on porches and in windows? Or does the yearly ritual mean something, however obscure, to many who participate?<br /><br />Anthropomorphic vegetable figures were a prominent Halloween symbol during the early twentieth century, when most Americans were still living agrarian lives, and yet there is no entry considering them, which may leave readers with the impression that the numinous aspects of many powerful Halloween symbols are simply beyond Morton's range of understanding or expression.<br /><br />'The Halloween Encyclopedia' should have been a feast for the mind, imagination, and senses, but is unlikely to inspire enthusiasm in either those new to the study of the subject or those with considerable interest in it. Morton's reference to \\"the gays in American,\\" as if such a label, which many with preferences for their own sex reject, could identify millions of diverse individuals, is unintentionally hilarious, and readers may wonder what Morton's unqualified aside that Reagan Administration oppressed \\"gays and gay rights\\" is doing in a book on Halloween.n Encyclopedia' should have been a feast for the mind, imagination, and senses, but is unlikely to inspire enthusiasm in either those new to the study of the subject or those with considerable interest in it.

Both novels share a common theme, and like the earlier novel, 'A Far Cry From Kensington' is largely autobiographical and takes place in virtually the same setting and time period: the literary world of early Fifties London. Both are explorations, via reminiscence, of the banality of everyday evil, taking place among the workaday, routine lives of the lower middle class.<br /><br />Less scathing if no less hilarious than many of its predecessors, the relatively unsung 'A Far Cry From Kensington' is the most realistic and humane novel among the twenty-odd Spark wrote. It is also exceptional in that it is the single Spark fiction in which a love affair blossoms into a successful relationship of duration.<br /><br />The story of the universally respected though immensely overweight Mrs. Hawkins, 'A Far Cry From Kensington' follows two divergent threads in her daily life: the mounting sufferings of a rooming house neighbor who is being anonymously threatened, and the problems that stem from her own continuous encounters with Hector Bartlett, a manipulative sycophant who hopes to use her footholds in the publishing world to advance his nonexistent literary career.<br /><br />While 'Loitering With Intent' can be read as something of a tactical combat manual, 'A Far Cry From Kensington' is instructive in the art of deduction: caught up in a spiraling series of mysterious and increasingly serious coincidences, Mrs. Hawkins, short of both hard facts and physical evidence, actively unravels the odd events that are taking a toll on both the lives of her friends and her editorial career.<br /><br />Fully realizing she is as prone to misjudgment as anyone, Mrs. Hawkins, utilizing her intelligence, intuition, and instinct, nonetheless proceeds confidently and assertively to pierce the veil of secrecy and quiet conspiracy engulfing her. Spark is at a creative peak as she reveals the subtle turns, nuances, and moment-to-moment impressions in Mrs. Hawkins' mind as she forms her cautious conclusions.<br /><br />Unlike Spark's finest novel, 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1961), in which a significant portion of the mystery of human existence is shown to exist on a partially transcendent level, 'A Far Cry From Kensington' eventually grounds that mystery in the knowable everyday.<br /><br />Though the author was to return to something of the vision of 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' in 'Symposium' (1990), here she seems to be expressing that at least the mundane truths of human life can be ascertained by diligence of method, applied intelligence, and a fundamental willingness to be believe that some people are unabashedly predatory, unscrupulous, and ethically coarse at best.<br /><br />Another message of the novel is that the weak, the foolish, and the vacuous are among the most potentially dangerous individuals one can become involved with.<br /><br />Upon its release, a number of critics publicly objected with pointed distaste to some of Mrs. Hawkin's behavior, she who enjoys \\"a puritanical and moralistic nature; it is my happy element to judge between right and wrong, regardless of what I might actually do.\\"<br /><br />For, exhausted with Hector Bartlett's elaborate attempts at manipulation, unhypocritical Mrs. Hawkins calls him a \\"Pissseur de copie\\" to his face when she encounters him in a public park, and continues to do so, to the detriment of her publishing career, throughout the novel.<br /><br />\\"It seemed to me,\\" she says, that he \\"vomited literary matter, he urinated and sweated, he excreted it.\\" Far from keeping this observation to herself, Mrs. Hawkins loudly shares it with authors, editors, and publishers, and since Hector is protected by best-selling author Emma Loy, finds herself fired from one job after another.<br /><br />But Mrs. Hawkins is without regret: \\"I can't help it. Sometimes the words just come out and I can't stop it. It feels like preaching the gospel.\\"<br /><br />Thus in this and other passages, 'A Far Cry From Kensington' supports speaking one's perception of truth under certain circumstances, regardless of consequence, even if that truth represents an enormous breach of upper class WASP manners and social decorum.<br /><br />In Spark's vision as expressed here, building relationships of any kind solely for personal gain, manipulating others through callous, self-interested 'networking,' and general toadyism are high crimes, all of which Hector Bartlett is guilty of in the extreme.<br /><br />In fact, Hector is one of Camille Paglia's \\"court hermaphrodites\\": \\"red hair en brosse, brown corduroy trousers, tweed coat with leather patches on the sleeves, a yellow tie and a green shirt: this was gaudy in those days, and Hector Bartlett was always dressed in bright colors. He was tall, with a pronounced stoop of the shoulders, which made him seem older than he was--I imagine at the time, he would be in his mid-thirties. His face was round with a second fat chin. He had a small but full baby-mouth as if forever asking to suck a dummy teat.\\"<br /><br />Though many critics have felt otherwise, no amount of condescending liberal piety can excuse Hector's routine aggressive subterfuge, moral mediocrity, and parasitic nature. It's unlikely that Spark chose this character's name randomly: \\"hectoring\\" is exactly what this he often does to those he encounters, and 'Bartlett' suggests his \\"pudgy,\\" pear-shaped physique.<br /><br />Written in the plainest language possible but nonetheless poetically conceived and executed, 'A Far Cry From Kensington' belongs, with 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' 'The Girls of Slender Means' (1963), 'The Driver's Seat' (1970), 'The Takeover' (1976), and 'Loitering With Intent' with the very best of Spark's work.r passages, 'A Far Cry From Kensington' supports speaking one's perception of truth under certain circumstances, regardless of consequence, even if that truth represents an enormous breach of upper class WASP manners and social decorum.

But Fleur doesn't avoid such people as a matter of principal: she accepts them as inevitable and lives a life of creative \\"infiltration\\": \\"I was aware that I had a daemon inside me that rejoiced in seeing people as they were, and not only that, but more than ever as they were, and more, and more.\\" Fleur reveals other unusual skills as the story develops: like many artists, she is a bit of a mystic, a bit of a shaman.<br /><br />Also like much of Paglia's work, 'Loitering With Intent' is something of a blistering attack on high WASP hypocritical good manners and social decorum.<br /><br />While Fleur clearly believes in human decency, fair play, and politeness, she also believes in determined counterattack when duly provoked (\\"I was not any sort of a victim; I was simply not constituted for the role\\"), and her responses can be volcanic (\\"I was glad of my strong hips and sound cage of ribs to save me from flying apart, so explosive were my thoughts\\").<br /><br />Fleur uninhibitably recognizes her eventual adversaries as \\"swine,\\" \\"stupid,\\" \\"awful,\\" \\"hysterical,\\" \\"insolent,\\" and \\"self-indulgent fools.\\" The Baronne Clotilde du Loiret is \\"so stunned by privilege that she didn't know how to discern and reject a maniac,\\" homosexual poet Gray Mauser is \\"small, slight, and wispy, about twenty, with arms and legs not quite uncoordinated enough to qualify him for any sort of medical treatment, and yet definitely he was not put together right,\\" and a friend has \\"the ugliest grandchild I have ever seen but she loves it.\\"<br /><br />'Loitering With Intent' is partially a transposition of Spark's experience of the Poetry Society in the late Forties, when she held the position of General Secretary. In her autobiography, 'Curriculum Vitae' (1993), Spark stated that she was \\"employed, or embroiled, in that then riotous establishment.\\" In the present novel, Fleur becomes workaday secretary to the Autobiographical Association, a \\"crank\\" operation run by social snob and blackmailer Quentin Oliver, who also suffers from a messianic complex of vast proportions. Ever perceptive, Fleur is confident that what she is witnessing around her is pure collective madness.<br /><br />In Spark's first novel, 'The Comforters' (1957), protagonist Caroline Rose slowly awakens to the fact that she, everyone she knows, and indeed her entire perceived universe are actually only the fictional creations of an unknowable author composing Caroline's history on some unrealizable, presumably higher plane.<br /><br />In 'Loitering With Intent,' almost the opposite is true: as Fleur nears the end of completing her first novel, she becomes aware that the members of the Autobiographical Association are genuine human doppelgangers of the characters she has created, enacting an identical drama to the one she has constructed purely from her imagination. Thus, Fleur has foreseen the future unaware, and hazily anticipates the unavoidable disasters to come to those who are manipulative, vain, arrogant, and power-crzed.<br /><br />One of the book's most fascinatingelements is the chronically antagonistic relationship between Fleur and the aptly named Dottie, the maudlin wife of Fleur's bisexual lover, Leslie.<br /><br />Dottie is 49% friend and 51% enemy, and thus their oddly symbiotic relationship is of a kind most readers will recognize as having experienced at some point in their own lives. \\"I don't know why I thought of Dottie as my friend but I did. I believe she thought the same way about me although she didn't really like me. In those days, among the people I mixed with, one had friends almost by predestination. There they were, like your winter coat and your meager luggage. You didn't think of discarding them just because you didn't altogether like them.\\"<br /><br />'Loitering With Intent' is also one of the most acute examinations of the artistic temperament ever committed to paper. \\"When people say that nothing happens in their lives I believe them. But you must understand that everything happens to the artist; time is always redeemed, nothing is lost, and wonders never cease.\\" And: \\"I have never known an artist who at some in his life has not come into conflict with pure evil, realized as it may have been under the form of disease, injustice, fear, oppression or any other ill element that can afflict living creatures. The reverse doesn't hold true: that is to say, it isn't only the artist who suffers, or who perceives evil. But I think it is true that no artist has ever lived who has not experienced and then recognized something at first too incredibly evil to be real, then so undoubtedly real as to be undoubtedly true.\\"<br /><br />The novel is also a celebration of applied self-knowledge and the self-confidence that evolves from it: Fleur repeatedly realizes \\"what a wonderful thing it was to be a woman and an artist in the twentieth century,\\" and, regardless of the formidable enemies positioned against her, continually \\"goes on her way rejoicing.\\"<br /><br />In keeping with the era in which it is set, 'Loitering With Intent' also includes a brief tribute to Edith, Osbert, and Sacheverell Sitwell as Leopold, Cynthia, and Claude Somerville, owners of The Triad Press, the publishers who eventually accept Fleur's prescient first fictional work.elements is the chronically antagonistic relationship between Fleur and the aptly named Dottie, the maudlin wife of Fleur's bisexual lover, Leslie.<br /><br />Dottie is 49% friend and 51% enemy, and thus their oddly symbiotic relationship is of a kind most readers will recognize as having experienced at some point in their own lives. \\"I don't know why I thought of Dottie as my friend but I did.

Salinger's 'The Catcher In The Rye' (1951) is the timeless, hugely popular blueprint for all coming-of-age novels that followed. The book's 16 year-old protagonist and antihero, Holden Caulfield, is not a rebel as many believe, but a petulant, emotionally injured, and insecure teenager who is fluent in outrage and at odds with almost every conceivable aspect of being alive.<br /><br />Unlike Fitzgerald's eager, amoral, and dashing Amory Blaine (This Side of Paradise, 1920), who delights in embracing and manipulating the shiny new worlds that open upon adulthood, Holden, who is grieving the recent death of a beloved younger brother, is a prematurely gray, lanky, and disgruntled loner belatedly stuck in the awkward years of adolescence. The privileged, somewhat spoiled son of a wealthy Manhattan family, the self-loathing Holden finds himself continuously surrounded by a web of other people who are obstructing embodiments of his own worst and most reviled qualities.<br /><br />Informatively, 'The Catcher In The Rye' opens and closes with hazy manifestations of homosexuality. The first goes unrealized by Holden, but the second is conspicuously realized and causes a full blown panic attack. In the first, Holden nudgingly provokes virile prep school roommate Stradlater into a symbolical rape, a rape that leaves the ostensibly defenseless Holden bloodied but unsatisfied.<br /><br />The charismatic, footloose Stradlater, who is nonchalantly used to getting his way with others, is, in Holden's eyes, \\"pretty handsome\\" and \\"very sexy,\\" has \\"very broad shoulders,\\" and is the type of young man Holden believes his own parents would find admirable; Holden comments repeatedly on the beauty of his roommate's golden hair.<br /><br />Unable to resist Stradlater's orbit, even while Stradlater is using the bathroom, Holden, a man obsessed, grabs his roommate in a headlock while he is shaving and bare-chested, and goes so far as to perform a spontaneous, effete mock tap dance for him. Crying out \\"It's the opening night of Ziegfeld Follies,\\" Holden makes it clear that the role he is enacting in this courting ritual is one of a respectable citizen falling from grace by exhibiting his true, no longer deniable inner nature.<br /><br />When the ignored Holden, who is a virgin, briefly backs away, Stradlater, \\"in just his damn shorts and all,\\" gets \\"very damn playful\\" in return, and the two fall into a briefly blissful wrestling match on Holden's bed. Since during this episode Holden's irrepressible behavior--and anger--is ostensibly the result of Stradlater's \\"giving the time\\" to a young lady Holden covets, the narrative makes it clear that the atmosphere in their room is sexually-charged and haunted by displacement.<br /><br />A careful reading of this scene reveals that Holden, who reasonably lacks full self-awareness, is angry not because his roommate has had sexual intercourse with the young lady in question, but because Stradlater hasn't \\"given the time\\" to him. Afterward, Holden describes their violent fight--which ends with Stradlater kneeling on Holden's chest, their drooling faces inches apart--as a \\"tiff.\\"<br /><br />Holden's combustible encounter with Stradlater is also partially a self-inflicted if failed initiation into manhood: \\"You never saw so much gore in your life. I had blood all over my mouth and chin and even on my pajamas and bathrobe. It partly scared me and partly fascinated me. All that blood and all sort of made me look tough.\\" Is the bloodied Holden symbolically no longer a virgin? Does Stradlater's beating represent a provoked if less than fulfilling violation? Has Holden now become more of a man, or less of one?<br /><br />After the series of disastrous episodes that compose the balance of the story, some of which involve transvestites and \\"flits,\\" as Holden calls homosexually-inclined men, the exhausted young man briefly finds false hope in the company of former teacher Mr. Antolini, one of the few adults for whom he has any respect.<br /><br />Comforted for the first time in the book by his teacher's wisdom and concern, Holden (\\"a very, very strange boy,\\" Antolini calls him), \\"shaking like a madman,\\" bolts from his mentor's apartment in well-realized homosexual panic when he awakens to find the married Mr. Antolini patting his head in the darkness. Is the wise, sympathetic Mr. Antolini molesting Holden or genuinely expressing anxious regard and tenderness?<br /><br />\\"I know more damn perverts, at school and all, than anybody you ever met, and they're always being perverty when I'm around,\\" Holden now reveals. He has already conveyed that \\"Sex is something I really don't understand too hot. You never know where the hell you are. I keep making up these sex rules for myself, and then I break them right away...sex is something I just don't understand. I swear to God I don't.\\"<br /><br />What rules has Holden set for himself and then broken? Holden has been told that \\"half the married guys in the world were flits and didn't even know it,\\" and is subsequently \\"waiting to turn into a flit or something.\\" It may be that Holden, who despises \\"phonies\\" above all others, suffers profoundly from being an unconscious or semi-conscious phoney himself. Throughout the narrative, Holden's wishful associations with women prove to be more like sibling relationships than romantic or erotic attachments.<br /><br />Controversial in its day, 'The Catcher In The Rye' shocked the American reading public with its coarse but realistic language and its sympathetic depiction of the morose, angry, often hilarious Holden, who was an explicit example of every \\"good\\" family's worse nightmare. Today's readers will relate to Holden as all honest readers did then and have since, since Holden is only a vulnerable, frightened, perceptive everyman searching for a single validating role in life, and one who is temporarily a little more lost in the world--and within himself--than most find desirable.r.

Scott Fitzgerald's sterling 'The Great Gatsby' (1925) is broadly considered the greatest American work of fiction of the twentieth century; with Twain's 'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' (1885), it is one of two viable candidates for the mythic title of the Great American Novel. Coming on the heels of the glib, hilarious 'This Side of Paradise' (1920) and the overextended 'The Beautiful And The Damned' (1922), 'The Great Gatsby' represented both an immense step forward in Fitzgerald's artistry and the kind of achievement only a handful of writers are capable of producing over the course of a lifetime.<br /><br />What makes 'The Great Gatsby' all the more remarkable is the fact that the economically-written novel is built upon a thin, almost predictable plot which concerns itself exclusively with crass, spiritually coarse people.<br /><br />With the exception of hopeful, naive narrator Nick Carraway, almost all of the characters are frayed personalities existing in a depthless, moment to moment world which lacks values, substance, and any inherent quality worth living for.<br /><br />Magnificently wealthy Tom Buchanan is an earthy, brutish man who believes that \\"might makes right,\\" while his attractive wife Daisy is a skittish, shallow, and unintentionally callous woman apt to go with whatever the wind blows her way. Their friend Jordan Baker, a jaded sportswoman with a talent for shrewd social observation, illustrates the novel's cynical view of both humanity and the American way of life. Jay Gatsby, whose flaws are somewhat easier to sympathize with, stands in contrast to these diversion-seeking characters.<br /><br />Gatsby is a delusional man with a benevolent God complex, a manipulative, calculating individual who falteringly believes that the past--and the truth--can be obliterated and permanently transcended by sheer force of will. Unlike the Buchanans and Jordan, Gatsby has more than filled the empty void of the universe with his fantasies of romantic fulfillment. But Tom, Daisy, and Jordan eventually show signs of human feeling and moral awareness, however briefly, while Gatsby, who is also exceedingly wealthy, clearly reflects their superficial vision in some of his own choices, actions, and values.<br /><br />The genius of 'Th'e Great Gatsby' is evident in the manner in which Fitzgerald subtly underscores and illustrates the motivators that drive and define the American psyche. In an America that is both a relatively new country as well as a capitalistic one, Gatsby and Tom are concerned with recreating themselves and achieving self - esteem, social respect, and power through the attainment and maintenance of wealth, the single recognized indicator of success in their world.<br /><br />A distorting-mirror image of the American Dream, 'The Great Gatsby' illustrates how a sincere desire for evolved selfhood can instead devolve into a nightmare scenario of the nouveau riche. To his credit, the pseudo-heroic Gatsby has a larger, if impossibly imagined, goal beyond the accumulation of wealth, property, and friends.<br /><br />The novel is also a meditation on how the American desire to achieve a socially respected, successful identity usually requires moral compromise and a series of carefully - constructed fabrications, which in turn may lead directly to self delusion. Jay Gatsby may be American literature's most famous chameleon, though one ultimately lacking the nimble antisocial personality to successfully pull off his charade.<br /><br />Interestingly, few establishment critics have commented at length on Gatsby's youthful relationship with wealthy, older mentor Dan Cody, a suspect relationship that Nick rightly refers to \\"strange.\\"<br /><br />As a striking but penniless young man, Gatsby has been employed by Cody \\"in a vague personal capacity\\" while he remained with Cody he was in turn steward, mate, skipper, secretary and even jailor.\\" Having traveled together three times around the world by yacht, their longidle comes to end when Cody's wife Ella suddenly comes \\"on board\\" and puts a stop to their companionship. Then Cody--bereft of Gatsby's company--suddenly dies.<br /><br />As an adult, Gatsby keeps a portrait of Cody prominently displayed in his mansion, which Nick calls \\"a token of forgotten violence.\\" Is Gatsby, despite his troubadour-like obsession with Daisy, in fact bisexually inclined? Or has his relationship with Cody merely been an opportunistic means to an end? Or one of honest mentoring?<br /><br />When Gatsby invites Daisy to see his palatial estate, Nick is surprised to suddenly come upon Klipspringer, a man Gatsby refers to as his \\"boarder.\\" Klipspringer, who has never previously been mentioned in the narrative and who promptly disappears back to wherever he came from, is discovered \\"in pajamas\\" \\"doing liver exercises on the floor\\" in one of the spare bedrooms. Nick then recalls that he has seen the mysterious Klipspringer \\"wandering hungrily about the beach\\" earlier that morning.<br /><br />During an uncomfortable lapse in conversation, Gatsby lights on the idea of having \\"Klipspringer play the piano,\\" and calls out \\"Ewing!\\" Entering, Klipspringer is described as \\"an embarrassed, slightly worn young man with shell-rimmed glasses and scanty blonde hair.\\" Sitting at the piano, Klipspringer plays a song of his own choosing, tellingly called \\"The Love Nest.\\"<br /><br />Fitzgerald makes it evident that Klipspringer is both 'artistic' and subordinate to Gatsby's whims. Curiously, Nick, who is fascinated by the enigmatic Gatsby's motivations, never raises the question of Klipspringer again. Is the fashion conscious, antique-loving Jay Gatsby, like Holden Caulfield, one of American literature's encrypted homosexual figures?<br /><br />In a novel as concerned with questions of identity as this, the Dan Cody and Klipspringer episodes are impossible to overlook and can hardly be accidental. Later in the story, the cuckolded George Wilson says, \\"God sees everything.\\" Is the reader intended to \\"see everything\\" about Gatsby as well? It's worth noting that both of Fitzgerald's previous books feature shrill, effete male characters whose antics border on high camp.<br /><br />Less than hugely successful upon publication, it wasn't until the fifties that 'The Great Gatsby' was fully recognized as the masterpiece it is. Balanced and poetically realized throughout, with 'The Great Gatsby' Fitzgerald mastered the art of revealing the soulful tragedy inherent in both the complex and commonplace members of mankind.idle comes to end when Cody's wife Ella suddenly comes \\"on board\\" and puts a stop to their companionship.

Eliot's 'Prufrock and Other Observations' (1917), 'Poems' (1920), and 'The Waste Land' (1922), and thus provides readers with a fair introduction to the work of one of the twentieth century's greatest poets. The American expatriate was a genuine original, bringing forth a new Modernist voice at a time when the movement was at its beginning and Edwardian poetry still carried the day in England.<br /><br />Clipped, dry, angular, and intellectual if still emotionally sensitive, Eliot's vision of deserted midnight urban streets, ever-present enveloping yellow or brown fog, doubt-obsessed social misfits (\\"Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?\\" \\"Do I dare disturb the universe?\\"), and city dwellers quietly ensnared in a mundane round of workaday routine had an enormous impact on the cultural scene of the period. If the poet doesn't strictly focus on the ugly, he does focus on the unadorned and mundane detritus of civilization in the immediate: \\"morning comes to consciousness / of faint stale smells of beer / from the sawdust-trampled streets.\\" He speaks of \\"grimy scraps\\" of \\"newspapers from vacant lots,\\" \\"broken blinds and chimney-pots,\\" and of \\"raising dingy shades / in a thousand furnished rooms,\\" as if the inexorable void of outer space was present in the next flat and steadily closing in. Even \\"the evening\\" \\"is spread out against the sky / Like a patient etherized upon a table.\\"<br /><br />Human consciousness and human nature are hesitant at best and deeply troubled, in any number of ways, at worst: sleep reveals \\"a thousand sordid images\\" of which the \\"soul\\" is \\"constituted,\\" and the palms of \\"both hands\\" are \\"soiled.\\"  The poet states that \\"There will be time to murder and create,\\" and 'Sweeney Erect' describes the act of sexual intercourse in desperate, awkward, unfulfilling, and bestial terms. In fact, nature in all its manifestations is largely repugnant to Eliot; 'Sweeney Erect' literally describes female genitalia as the vagina dentata: \\"This withered root of knots of hair / Slitted below and gashed with eyes / This oval O cropped out with teeth.\\" Nor are the seasons a source of comfort: \\"April is the cruellest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing / Memory and desire,\\" he says, and suitably, most of the early poems speak only gravely of autumn and winter. The \\"soft October night\\" mentioned in 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock' startles, since the image it conjures slightly betrays traditional associations of comfort and perceived beauty.<br /><br />During the period in which the poems were written, Eliot was in the throes of a very troubled marriage to the mentally unstable Vivienne Haigh-Wood, which explains much of the revulsion and guilt-ridden despondency expressed. Eliot was projecting and transposing: history has shown that the poet frequently acted without responsibility and integrity towards Vivienne and their severe personal problems, and thus the vengeful Furies that appear among the dramatis personae in a later Eliot drama were real forces in the poet's psyche. Eliot's inability to cope with Vivienne resulted in moral and ethical failures on his part: the real waste land was Eliot's own perception of his life and reaction to it.<br /><br />But in his later work, Eliot's fervent religious beliefs would blossom to the fore; much of that poetry would be underscored by a starkly expressed belief in Christian salvation and the potential resurrection of the spirit.<br /><br />Eliot was not an admirer of the Romantic school, and thus his urban landscapes are neither post-Romantic nor decadent environments, but simply sterile cityscapes devoid of any quality that genuinely support the promise inherent in human existence. However, though Eliot decried the solipsism of the Romantics, his own early work is often pinched, parsimonious, and reductive to the point of constriction.<br /><br />'The Waste Land,' which is accompanied by five dense author-imposed pages of tedious explanatory notes (which ostensibly insure that the reader understands the poem contains dozens of references to the Bible, Ovid, Sappho, St. Augustine, Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, Baudelaire, Frazer, and even Herman Hesse, among others) is particularly obscure, and therefore solipsistic in its own fashion: its intended audience was not the common man on the street by any means, but the clever, educated, well read, and competitive armchair intellectual of the kind that populated the literary circles in which the author then moved. Aptly titled, 'The Waste Land' is a tedious academic game and a triumph not of poetry but of marketing, with multiple lines like \\"Weialala leia Wallala leialala\\" and \\"Co co rico co co rico\\" that are guaranteed to lock its audience out.<br /><br />Eliot may have shunned Romanticism, but he never escaped the powerful romantic elements in his own nature; this is apparent right at the beginning of his published work with 1917's 'The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock,' which famously ends with \\"the mermaids singing, each to each\\" and Prufrock observing, \\"I do not think they will sing to me.\\" \\"I should have been a pair of ragged claws / Scuttling across the floor of silent seas\\" can also be interpreted in terms of romantic, even rebellious, longing: the tone is different from that broadly found in Blake, Wordsworth, Shelley, and Byron, but the desire for unrestricted freedom, even oblivious freedom, is actively present nonetheless.<br /><br />Even if intended ironically, 'Rhapsody On A Windy Night' is romantically titled, and the later 'Marina' (\\"What images return...O my daughter\\"), 'Ash Wednesday' (1930), and 'Four Quartets' would be thoroughly suffused with longing, desire, and sense of loss. In fact, some may interpret Eliot's fervent Protestantism as the final manifestation of this restless trend in his personality.<br /><br />Since in his early work Eliot's poetry is more satisfying on a line by line basis (\\"Webster was much possessed by death / And saw the skull beneath the skin\\"), a more complete portrait of the poet and his work is available in 'The Complete Poems and Plays 1909 - 1950' (1971).s of tedious explanatory notes (which ostensibly insure that the reader understands the poem contains dozens of references to the Bible, Ovid, Sappho, St. Augustine, Dante, Milton, Shakespeare, Baudelaire, Frazer, and even Herman Hesse, among others) is particularly obscure, and therefore solipsistic in its own fashion: its intended audience was not the common man on the street by any means, but the clever, educated, well read, and competitive armchair intellectual of the kind that populated the literary circles in which the author then moved.

Doubtlessly, this is because his suicide appears to fly in the face of every quality Hemingway stood for: strength of character, courage, adventurousness, robust health, stoicism, poise, and manliness.<br /><br />But the book includes on telling chapter on poet Ernest Walsh titled \\"The Man Who Was Marked For Death\\" that is somewhat chilling in light of what was to follow. Walsh remarks that both he and Hemingway share the same first name, and when the question arises whether Hemingway is also \\"marked for death,\\" Walsh says, \\"No, You're marked for Life.\\" Hemingway presciently responds, \\"Give me time.\\"<br /><br />Another memento mori: in the first of several chapters dedicated to the author's exploits with F. Scott Fitzgerald, an episode occurs which Hemingway refers to as \\"very strange.\\" The two men are enjoying drinks with a third when a sudden change comes over Fitzgerald: \\"the skin seemed to tighten over his face until all the puffiness was gone and then it drew tighter until the face was like a death's head. The eyes sank and began to look dead and the lips were drawn tight and the color left the face so that it was the color of candle wax. This was not my imagination. His face became a true death's head, or death mask, in front of my eyes.\\"<br /><br />With 'A Moveable Feast,' Hemingway, who suffered from both depression and alcoholism, was clearly reflecting back on a happier time in his existence, which explains the book's slightly unreal tone, which often wavers between a travelogue, a light hearted comedy of manners, and a mild European fairy tale, though no outright cracks in its facade of 'realism' appear.<br /><br />However, it is significant that Hemingway wrote in his preface that \\"if the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction.\\" Though World War I is fresh in the young writer's mind and gruesome evidence of it is everywhere on the streets of Paris, Hemingway writes as if life were a lovely, sensuous, and fulfilling parade in which aggression, fear, deprivation, oppression, frustration, and treachery play no part whatsoever.<br /><br />For example, though the young Hemingway is chronically short of money and thus goes hungry on occasion, his hunger is always couched in quaintly romantic terms that border on the narcissistic: he avoids acknowledging his inability to purchase food to friends and acquaintances because such an act would represent a breach of his excellent good manners, though both he and Shakespeare and Company co-owner Sylvia Beach clearly believe that three meals a day are a necessity. Few readers will find it believable that Hemingway ever genuinely knew what real hunger was: 'A Moveable Feast' treats the subject as merely another fashionable prerequisite for struggling young writers. Though some critics have applauded the book for its unsentimental character, it is in fact nothing but a sentimental reverie, though never overtly one; on the other side of that reverie, a loaded shotgun was waiting.<br /><br />In keeping with its title, 'A Moveable Feast' also describes how Hemingway and wife Hadley routinely spend a fair portion of whatever incoming money they receive on the most sumptuous Parisian food and wine available, though the author is shrewd enough to include episodes in which he equally appreciates common cafe fair and fish caught in the Seine. Hemingway's descriptions of eating and drinking color the book, but become increasingly extended to the point that they begin to resemble campy self-parody, and his obvious sophistication about the nuances of Parisian culinary habits eventually sound cloying ('Macon' is \\"a good white wine, moderately full-bodied but with a low alcohol content,\\" while, as an aside in a chapter taking place in Lyon, he says \\"the mutton had been excellent.\\").<br /><br />Written in the crisp high WASP style for which he was famous, Hemingway seems unaware that, for many people of all races and ethnicities, such style often seems thin, transparent, and obvious, and one that doesn't disguise the writer's ambitions, pretensions, false humility, and underlying smugness nearly as well as they believe. The high WASP style always includes a distancing effect which presents itself as objectivity wrapped in elegant good manners, but which unfortunately nonetheless stands on unequal footing above its audience. With the F. Scott Fitzgerald of 'The Great Gatsby' (1925), Hemingway was its greatest practitioner. Hemingway mastered the art of literally selling his own sense of subduedly expressed superiority to readers everywhere, and thus making them pay for the opportunity to revere and admire him.<br /><br />'A Moveable Feast' also includes a number of charming and funny vignettes about famous writers, most notably Americans Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, and Ezra Pound. But the book, as a potential fiction, cannot be read as an accurate account of events as they occurred, and thus Hemingway's dreamy memoir of a more innocent time has to be accepted as highly suspect, especially in its details.wd enough to include episodes in which he equally appreciates common cafe fair and fish caught in the Seine.

US	35944741	RQH27RABKC9MM	0811212696	726372275	Collected Stories (A New Directions Book)	Books	4	20	22	N	Y	"All That You Need's To Be Given A Push On The Head"	'Tennessee Williams: Collected Stories' (1985) is a highly readable if occasionally unpleasant volume by an author who, like the Scottish novelist Muriel Spark, is one of the uncelebrated masters of the short story form. Williams imbued many of his tales with overt sexual content, so that some of the material resembles the kind of softcore erotica that Anais Nin produced in the 1940s, and which was published after her death as 'Delta of Venus' (1977) and 'Little Birds' (1979).<br /><br />Beginning with Williams' first published work and including stories written just before his death in 1983, most of the pieces, which originally appeared in literary journals, are very much of their time, and thus powerfully reflect the degree to which Williams internalized the shame and self-hatred he experienced as a homosexual male in a predominantly heterosexual and anti-homosexual society.<br /><br />Never less than forthright to the point of bluntness, several of the stories wantonly revel in the repulsive and the grotesque, and thus seem intended not merely to illuminate but to shock and repel. In essence, many of the pieces seem like both acts of revenge and blows against the empire, but Williams was awkwardly wielding a double-edged sword, one which did not by any means only reveal the hypocrisies of those he intended to mock.<br /><br />In 'Hard Candy,' for example, an obnoxious elderly man who has been a lifelong 'closeted' homosexual dies by choking while performing an act of oral sex on a young male drifter he solicits. Thus the story's title refers not to the sweets the man carries in his pocket as a means of establishing an opening dialogue with attractive male strangers, but to a portion of the drifter's anatomy. Williams clearly intends the irony of the title to be so blatant as to be unironic, and this doubling, reflexive quality unequivocally establishes 'Hard Candy' as a piece of dark, unabashed camp humor. But such humor will always find only a limited receptive audience, especially since most 'camp humor' today seems like little more than an outmoded culture artifact.<br /><br />Throughout 'Collected Stories,' most of Williams' homosexual characters are depicted in caricatural fashion, whether as overly-poised, somewhat brittle aesthetes or as shrill, irresponsible merrymakers whose singular goal is continual sexual interaction with as many partners as possible. Those that fit neither of these categories are poorly socialized and isolated, but never developed in other ways so that they become shadow-casting, three-dimensional characters for whom homosexual responsiveness is but one factor in their existence.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, it is the objects of these characters' desire whom Williams depicts sympathetically, but these men, who are usually young, handsome, muscular, and somewhat unintelligent if not brutishly stupid, are typically shallow caricatures as well.<br /><br />In his short stories, Williams was at his best when describing those &#34;betwixt and between&#34; men who are ostensibly heterosexual but nonetheless nonchalantly open to passive sexual intercourse with other men, especially if money is involved. Thus, 'One Arm,' the story of a boxer who loses a limb in an automobile accident and then drifts into hustling before finding himself on death row for murder, is one of the most fully realized works in the volume.<br /><br />'Collected Stories' also includes a number of powerful stories which revolve around heterosexual characters, such as the Caldwellesque 'Kingdom of Earth' and the outrageous 'Miss Coynte of Green,' which almost devolves into parody, but in these, as in the others, brutality, coarseness, and lasciviousness are the order of the day, and qualities such as integrity, respect for others, and fundamental human decency are presented as little more than sham social hypocrisies that have little genuine presence in actuality.<br /><br />Also included is the 55-page 'The Knightly Quest,' an extended piece of sociological science fiction which hilariously examines governmental attempts at cultural control and world domination during the Cold War era. Unfortunately, this 'novella' is episodic and fragmented, and ends abruptly, as if Williams didn't really know what to do with the material and then lost interest in it completely.ended piece of sociological science fiction which hilariously examines governmental attempts at cultural control and world domination during the Cold War era.

(1819) alongside another evocative piece of Americana, 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' a wondrous story equally set in Irving's beloved Hudson River Valley.<br /><br />Though not as multilayered as its longer and slightly more well known fellow, 'Rip Van Winkle' also has long roots in Old World folklore, which is appropriate, since 'The Sketch Book' was the first book by an American writer to be taken seriously by the European audiences that then set the standard in the West.<br /><br />Like the earlier 'A Knickerbocker's History of New York' (1809), 'Rip Van Winkle' is playfully attributed to Dutch antiquarian \\"Diedrich Knickerbocker,\\" the most famous and certainly the most charming of several personae Irving adopted as an author.<br /><br />Written in simple but gorgeously visionary language, 'Rip Van Winkle' is the story of the lazy but warm spirited farmer, who, in an effort to escape the \\"petticoat despotism\\" of his \\"termagant\\" wife, flees for an afternoon's hunting in the lonely, autumnal Catskill Mountains.<br /><br />Accompanied only by Wolf, his faithful but equally harassed dog, Rip is surprised when he notices an odd figure approaching through the wilderness and calling out his name.<br /><br />The \\"short, square built old fellow with thick bushy hair and a grizzled beard\\" is carrying a \\"stout keg,\\" and gestures to Van Winkle to assist him with his burden.<br /><br />Taking up the \\"flagon,\\" Rip hesitantly follows the little man into an isolated ravine, and thus steps unknowingly into fairyland; there he finds himself confronted by a solemn and outlandishly dressed party of dwarfs playing at ninepins.<br /><br />Bewildered, Rip pours out the beverage for the assemblage, but can't resist taking a drink himself.<br /><br />Awaking on the mountainside, Van Winkle, finding Wolf gone and a badly rusted gun at his side, returns to town, where he discovers his home in ruins, his wife dead, his children grown to adulthood, the land of his birth now an independent nation freed from the yoke of the British, and himself a stranger to the villagers, who stare at his tattered clothing and exceptionally long facial hair.<br /><br />After making bewildered inquiries, he comes to accept that twenty years have passed.<br /><br />As a humble, good hearted, and mild tempered dreamer, Rip is an archetypal fairytale hero, though the only dragon slain is Dame Van Winkle, and she accidentally, by the passage of time itself.<br /><br />Like kindred spirit Ichabod Crane, Rip is not an absolute novice when it comes to the fantastic, for he has enjoyed telling the village children who love him \\"long stories about ghosts, witches, and Indians.\\"<br /><br />As in traditional Celtic fairy lore, in which eating or drinking while visiting fairyland is often punished with permanent residency there, Rip had made the honest mistake of partaking of fairy foodstuffs, and thus pays an unintended price for doing so.<br /><br />For Celtic fairy lore also featured multiple variations on the theme of fairy time; one minute of perceived human time might be seven years of fairy time, and a man spending a happy week dancing in fairyland might discover that one hundred years or more has past on earth upon his return.<br /><br />Whether dwarfs, elves, boggarts, or fairies, Irving's little people are first cousins to many of the mythological beings of European mythology.<br /><br />Interestingly, like the literally \\"solitary\\" fairies of Ireland and Scotland, who were brusque of manner at best and never seen in groups (as were the far more gregarious \\"trooping\\" fairies), the little men Rip holds audience with \\"maintain the gravest faces, the most mysterious silence,\\" and thus represent \\"the most melancholy party of pleasure he had ever witnessed.\\"<br /><br />But Irving, who deftly places his story in the historical setting of pre-Revolutionary America, also shrewdly offers his audience other interpretations for Van Winkle's strange mountain encounter.<br /><br />Though narrator Diedrich Knickerbocker acknowledges early that the Catskills are \\"fairy mountains,\\" one character, sage Peter Vanderdonk, explains that it was the dead \\"Hendrick Hudson\\" himself, who returns with his crew every twenty years \\"to keep a guardian eye on the river,\\" whom Rip encountered, while the postscript indeterminably discusses a variety of Indian spirits, including the Manitou, who haunt the region.<br /><br />One fact entirely overlooked by scholars everywhere is that American literature was born in the daimonic, a tradition begun by Irving but enthusiastically continued by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allen Poe.<br /><br />Like most of Irving's work, at present 'Rip Van Winkle' is a grossly underappreciated piece of pure Americana; certainly American literature could have gotten off to a much worst beginning than it did than with its gallant, optimistic, and uncynical founder. For Rip, despite the precariousness of his experience, learns to accept his fate and settles into a comfortable old age as a venerated member of his community.<br /><br />Not that very long ago, there was a time in America when, taking a direct cue from the story itself, some of America's young schoolchildren were fancifully taught that thunder was not the result of lightning, but merely the echo of the elves' occasional game of mountain bowling.<br /><br />This definitive edition, first published in 1905, features over fifty genuinely \\"mesmerizing\\" though somber watercolor illustrations by British master Arthur Rackham, which perfectly suit Irving's text and will captivate both adults and children alike.y offers his audience other interpretations for Van Winkle's strange mountain encounter.<br /><br />Though narrator Diedrich Knickerbocker acknowledges early that the Catskills are \\"fairy mountains,\\" one character, sage Peter Vanderdonk, explains that it was the dead \\"Hendrick Hudson\\" himself, who returns with his crew every twenty years \\"to keep a guardian eye on the river,\\" whom Rip encountered, while the postscript indeterminably discusses a variety of Indian spirits, including the Manitou, who haunt the region.<br /><br />One fact entirely overlooked by scholars everywhere is that American literature was born in the daimonic, a tradition begun by Irving but enthusiastically continued by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Edgar Allen Poe.<br /><br />Like most of Irving's work, at present 'Rip Van Winkle' is a grossly underappreciated piece of pure Americana; certainly American literature could have gotten off to a much worst beginning than it did than with its gallant, optimistic, and uncynical founder.

Like the characters in Genet, Frank kills because he wants to, because the male cronies he admires boast that they have committed murders of their own, and because he wants to establish some definite marker in his history to justify his life to himself.<br /><br />Oddly obsessed with Holst, his older male neighbor across the hall, Frank, who lives with his shrewish, brothel-keeping mother, seduces and then casts aside naïve young Sissy, Holst's daughter, for the sheer sport of it. But Frank's seduction of Sissy is also partially an act of unrealized homosexual sublimation, as absolutely nothing Frank does arouses Holst's attention. Though Holst all but witnesses Frank committing his first murder, and could reasonably assume that Frank is the person who has violated his daughter during his absence, Holst remains utterly passive.<br /><br />'Dirty Snow' is one of Simenon's more critically respected novels, but while the first two-thirds are gripping and suspenseful, the last third, in which Frank is arrested and incarcerated by the occupying administration, is dull and undramatic.<br /><br />In 'The Miracle of the Rose' (1951), Genet brought his solitary prisoners to vibrant, shadow-casting life; but Frank's incarceration plods on uneventfully for over 60 pages, and Frank lacks the rich inner fabric of Genet's &#34;saints,&#34; dreaming social misfits, transvestites, and randy, strutting alpha males. It is difficult to fathom why Simenon chose to conclude the novel as he does, since the anticlimactic finale deflates a book which had the potential to become a minor classic.over 60 pages, and Frank lacks the rich inner fabric of Genet's &#34;saints,&#34; dreaming social misfits, transvestites, and randy, strutting alpha males.

US	35944741	R2P5A081QPUXQU	006054581X	443561547	The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury	Books	3	18	42	N	N	Awe And Wonder As The Secret Of Life	Sam Weller's 'The Bradbury Chronicles: The Life of Ray Bradbury' (2005) is an interesting, enjoyable, and inspirational, if somewhat gushing, biography of the world renowned American author. Weller's introduction, which is agog with wide-eyed admiration, makes it clear that 'The Bradbury Chronicles,' which appears to have been written in direct conjunction with its subject, is not as objective a book as it might have been. This is doubly problematic when considering that Bradbury's work is itself deeply underscored by sentimentality, a fact which Bradbury has both publicly acknowledged and celebrated.<br /><br />Bradbury is an American original, and has had an enormous influence on popular culture since the publication of his first book, 'Dark Carnival,' in 1947. Throughout his adult life, Bradbury has stressed that he is not an intellectual--nor interested in writing for intellectuals--yet he has simultaneously waged a protracted if only somewhat successful war to have his short stories and novels considered as literature rather than science fiction, fantasy, and horror by publishers, critics, and the broad reading public.<br /><br />Today, much of the author's work is still mildly enjoyable but feels sadly dated, and even a cursory review of his work reveals its unsophisticated, non-literary character. Weighted with sentimentality and an endless parade of exclamation points, underpinned by platitudes rather than complex universal truths, and often obvious, predictable, and insubstantial, Bradbury's work will always be most appreciated by the young and the non-literary general reader.<br /><br />Compared to other American authors whose fiction has been largely defined by a relatively light surface tone, including Washington Irving, Erskine Caldwell, and Jane Bowles, Bradbury's work, which is entirely without subtext, simply falls flat. Though only a portion, if a significant portion, of his work deals with the fantastic, Bradbury should be grouped with H. P. Lovecraft; even Algernon Blackwood was a better, more powerful, and telling writer. In terms of fantastic fiction, Bradbury pales besides Lord Dunsany and the Ursula K. Le Guin of the original three Earthsea novels. Comparisons to Edgar Allen Poe are plainly ridiculous.<br /><br />While it must be kept in mind that 'The Martian Chronicles' (1950) both preceded and anticipated the science fiction revolution of the Fifties, the book is neither as clever nor as telling about human nature and Western culture as it believes itself to be. Bradbury states that he found the 1980 television miniseries adaptation of the book \\"boring,\\" which is no wonder, since the source itself is listless, confusing, overlong, and overwritten. 'Dandelion Wine' (1957), Bradbury's relentlessly sensitive novel based upon his small town Illinois childhood, is likewise a book which is more likable in theory than in fact; its observations and its expression of those observations are simply neither as acute nor as moving as the author seems to have believed when composing it.<br /><br />In fact, Bradbury's fiction works best in the reader's memory; rereading his work after a passage of years is often a gravely disappointing experience.<br /><br />In early short story 'The Wind,' a man is haunted by the wind and thought mad by his friends; in 'The Pumpernickel,' a man experiences a deluge of sentimental memories after buying a loaf of bread in a delicatessen, all of which he forgets the following morning; in 'The Fruit At The Bottom Of The Bowl,' a murderer becomes obsessed with wiping  surfaces clean after his crime, imagining his fingerprints everywhere. These and every other Bradbury story could have been thematically and dramatically developed into something significant, in the multi-prismed tradition of Poe, Denton Welch, Paul Bowles, Muriel Spark, Tennessee Williams, or Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but Bradbury in fact has very little to say about anything beyond the obvious.<br /><br />In one work afteranother, Bradbury has taken the easy way out, presenting nothing complex for the reader to seize upon and respond to, and thus reading him is an unusually passive experience. However, Bradbury is one of the very few American writers who has ever perceived and creatively responded to simultaneously wistful, eerie, stark, and transcendent beauty of autumn as it manifests in many regions of the United States, and for that, he is to commended.<br /><br />Weller provides a valuable outline of Bradbury's life and creative struggles, and the supporting cast, which includes John Huston, Forrest J. Ackerman, Lorraine Day, Ray Harryhausen, Aldous Huxley, August Derleth, Walt Disney, Rod Serling, Bernard Berenson, and Fredrico Fellini, is rich and varied. Bradbury's optimistic, can-do philosophy, which is admirable and somewhat contagious, permeates the book, as does his belief that 'adulthood' is a sham.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after Bradbury's creative high period in the Fifties and Sixties, which also included brilliant screenplays for 'It Came From Outer Space' (1953) and 'Moby Dick' (1956), the biography narrows and slows to a crawl, covering the last thirty-odd years of the author's life in less than fifty watery pages. Weller is also strangely unanalytical throughout; only a very small handful of Bradbury's short stories and novels are described or discussed at length, and none are ever criticized, found wanting, or harshly judged.<br /><br />Thus 'The Bradbury Chronicles,' which has been published with its subject's glowing endorsement, is a less than definitive accounting of its subject; that book, perhaps appropriately, still exists in the future.another, Bradbury has taken the easy way out, presenting nothing complex for the reader to seize upon and respond to, and thus reading him is an unusually passive experience.

Taking place during the period in which it was written, the novel is neither a black comedy burlesque like 'Tobacco Road' nor an example of the more private, pseudo-surrealist fiction Caldwell produced with 'Journeyman' or some of his many short stories of the era.<br /><br />Instead, 'Trouble in July' attempts and fails to achieve a finely poised balance between realistic fiction and a kind of Keystone Cops comedy. But pointed exaggeration at every level was Caldwell's forte, and the novel, which was written with difficulty over a period of several years, is redundant, flat, predictable, and anticlimactic, despite the piling up of several reoccurring cinematic plot devices, such as the worst possible person walking in the door or phoning at the absolute worst time.<br /><br />In  Chapter Six, heavily put-upon sheriff and protagonist Jeff McCurtain conceives a plan to escape his duties by inventing a threatening posse of masked bandits, only to find himself held at gunpoint by an identical gang in reality.<br /><br />'Trouble In July' features several politicians who are only concerned that the lynching, which they see as inevitable and acceptable as long as it reflects \\"the will of the people,\\" not turn public opinion against them, a sheriff's deputy whose great joy in life is \\"hunting possums between midnight and dawn and tracking down runaway Negroes at every opportunity,\\" vigilante gangs for whom the routine killing of blacks is the umbrella answer to most of life's problems, a religious zealot who is outraged that bibles depicting Christ as a black man are circulating in the Negro community, a signature-gathering campaign to \\"send all the Negroes to the country of Africa without delay,\\" a black character, the object of the lynching, who is little more than a wide-and-wild eyed caricature, and, among other Caldwell stock characters, a fifteen year-old uneducated white girl with an inordinate appetite for sex and attention.<br /><br />'God's Little Acre' used a similar formula, but that novel, Caldwell's best, was fraught with tension and conflict, and, as a result, contains one of the most suspenseful and poignant climaxes in all of American literature.

Simenon had few peers when it came to writing psychological fiction, and despite a hopeful if slightly improbable ending, the novel is gripping and seductive. Simenon also excelled at recording the vicissitudes of human emotion under stress, and his earnest depiction of Francios, who is crippled by jealousy, delusion, and rage, is superb.<br /><br />Early in the novel, Simenon shrewdly depicts Kay, the object of Francios's obsession, as a listless, calculating mythomaniac, so much so that during the book's first 50 pages, Kay seems like one of the permanently wounded, misplaced female protagonists found in Jean Rhys' five classic novels. But readers are seeing Kay through Francios's blighted eyes, and Kay eventually manifests on the page in quite a different fashion. Nonetheless, 'Three Rooms In Manhattan' revels in the grim, the sordid, and the violent, and an ugly fog of sadomasochism continually hangs in the air. Few 20th Century writers, with the exception of Denis De Rougemont, Jean Genet, and Vita Sackville-West, in her diaries, have had the courage to depict the cruelty and desire for domination and submission that lies just beneath the surface of passionate love.<br /><br />Appropriately, the book takes place in mid-autumn, when the New York City weather routinely shifts between the transcendent and the unpleasant. The novel's first half revolves around a sometimes nightmarish schedule of endless, compulsive, and directionless walks which the couple takes through the city. Stopping only to drink and smoke in bars, and occasionally to eat, Francios and Kay are two lost souls seeking solace in one another, and both incapable of being apart and unable to be alone, except for the briefest of intervals. All the while, unspoken suspicions, recriminations, and phantoms from the past hang in the air.<br /><br />Modern readers may find Francios misogynist in the extreme, as he spends a great amount of psychic energy spewing volleys of hatred towards Kay in his imagination, even while he walks calmly beside her through the haunted city streets.<br /><br />The idea of taking active revenge against all of the women who have wounded him--especially against his ex-wife, who has left him for a much younger man--through Kay is never far from his consciousness. But Simenon superbly reveals how it is the ostensibly subservient and masochistic Kay, and not Francios, who is the stronger of the two.<br /><br />Accepting even physical abuse, Kay manages to remain perceptive, objective, and resilient, while her lover repeatedly collapses in bouts of tears, humiliation, and self hatred. For Francios, passion and deep anxiety are synonymous; unable to live independently, he discovers that love is a stifling, suffocating trap too.<br /><br />The mood of fatalism that suffuses 'Three Rooms In Manhattan' was somewhat prescient; Simenon, upon whom Francios was based, eventually married Denyse Ouimet, the woman who inspired the character of Kay. But Ouimet later \\"lapsed by degrees into psychosis,\\" and the child of their union, Marie-Jo, committed suicide.<br /><br />Most of Simenon's non-detective fiction has been long out of print in America; New York Review Books is to be commended for bringing this and several other classic Simenon novels back into circulation.lks which the couple takes through the city.

The everyman farmer addressed in 'Prairie,' for example, is calmly advised by nature to \\"Kill your hogs with a knife slit under the ear. Hack them with cleavers. Hang them with hooks in the hind legs.\\"<br /><br />Nor does the poet ignore the savagery of man and all creatures. 'Wilderness' acknowledges that \\"There is a wolf in me...fangs pointed for tearing gashes...a red tongue for raw meat...and the hot lapping of blood...I sing and kill and work: I am a pal of the world: I came from the wilderness.\\"<br /><br />Sandburg was a poet of observation, and those reflected in 'Cornhuskers' are almost continually pensive: sorrow, loneliness, unfulfilled longing, and human isolation color the Midwestern landscape.<br /><br />\\"The gloaming is bitter,\\" he states in 'Sunset From Omaha Hotel Window,' not only in Omaha, but \\"in Chicago or Kenosha.\\"<br /><br />Sleeping dogs dream \\"Not any hate, not any love, not anything but dreams\\" in 'Three Pieces on the Smoke of Autumn,' unlike man.<br /><br />The tradesman of 'Bricklayer Love'  says, \\"I have thought of killing myself because I am only a bricklayer and you a woman who loves the man who runs a drug store.\\"<br /><br />The speaker in 'Testament' serenely consigns his corpse to the earth, where the \\"nanny goats and billy goats of the shanty people eat the clover over my grave,\\" for \\"I have had my chance to live with the people who have too much and the people who have too little and I chose one of the two and I have told no man why.\\"<br /><br />The poet of 'In Tall Grass' offers his bleached skull to the bees so that they may use it to build a honeycomb.<br /><br />'Cool Tombs' addresses the marginality of human accomplishment and celebrity in the face of mortality, whether for Abraham Lincoln, Ulyyses Grant, Pocahontas, or \\"any streetful of people.\\"<br /><br />In 'Prairie,' Sandburg observes \\"the past is a bucket of ashes.\\"<br /><br />In one of 'Cornhuskers' most famous entries, 'Grass,' humanity is reminded that everyone and everything are impermanent and eventually forgotten: \\"I am the grass; I cover all.\\"<br /><br />As in 'Chicago Poems,' politicians, the wealthy, the upper classes, and other leaders of society come in for repeated harsh criticism. \\"Huntington\\" in 'Southern Pacific,' though dead in \\"a house six feet long,\\" still blithely dreams of men addressing him as \\"Yes, sir.\\"<br /><br />'Palladiums' warns \\"Speak softly--the sacred cows may hear. Speak easy--the sacred cows must be fed.\\"<br /><br />'Profiteer' describes an honorary statue erected to \\"one who participated in the war vicariously and bought ten farms\\" with his spoils. 'Cornhuskers' was written during World War I, and 'The Four Brothers' identifies the \\"four big brothers\\" of the title--France, Russia, Britain, and America--as \\"hunting death.\\"<br /><br />In the vision of 'Cornhuskers,' man's meager hope arises from routine hard work, appreciation of the simple and the commonplace, and acceptance of the cycle of life. 'Caboose Thoughts' states \\"The sun, the birds, the grass - they know. They get along. We'll get along. It's going to come out all right- do you know?\\"<br /><br />Sandburg encourages the reader to \\"Look at six eggs in a mockingbird's nest...look at songs hidden in eggs,\\" and to appreciate, as he has, boys running \\"barefoot in the leaves\\" and \\"farmhands with their faces in fried catfish on a Monday morning.\\"<br /><br />Throughout, Sandburg speaks in the loose, conversational folk tone that was the hallmark of his work. Most of the poems have only a very light structure and appear spontaneously written, so that 'Potato Blossom Songs and Jigs' features lines such as \\"The story lags. The story has no connections. The story is nothing but a lot of banjo plinka planka plunks.\\"<br /><br />'Cornhuskers' can stand on its own, but works best when considered in immediate conjunction with later volumes 'Smoke And Steel' (1920), 'Slabs of the Sunburnt West' (1922), 'Good Morning, America' (1928), and 'The People, Yes' (1936), making 'The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg' the ideal vehicle for expressing his increasingly unappreciated vision.- do you know?\\"<br /><br />Sandburg encourages the reader to \\"Look at six eggs in a mockingbird's nest...look at songs hidden in eggs,\\" and to appreciate, as he has, boys running \\"barefoot in the leaves\\" and \\"farmhands with their faces in fried catfish on a Monday morning.\\"<br /><br />Throughout, Sandburg speaks in the loose, conversational folk tone that was the hallmark of his work.

The collection takes a hard and unswerving look at the grim realities of urban life for the common man, funneled through the flume of the author's committed socialist ideological perspective. Such an approach to poetry may have been somewhat novel in the America of the time, and both history and critics have been kind to Sandburg's sympathetic portraits of human suffering.<br /><br />But whether he is addressing \\"a dago shovelman,\\" an immigrant who has forgotten the dignified being his ancestors in Europe or who can no longer recognize \\"the new-mown hay smell calling on the wind,\\" a street walker with \\"haggard poems and desperate eyes,\\" or a young woman burned to death in a factory fire, Sandburg continually adopts the simplistic notion that the lower economic strata of society is always victimized but virtuous, while governmental institutions, bosses of all stripes, the professional classes, and the wealthy are uniformly cruel, oppressive, exploitive, and, at best, indifferent.<br /><br />Thus, 'Chicago Poems' reads like a 132-page polemic with a very narrow political point of view. While many of the author's observations are poignantly insightful (such as the poverty-stricken family of a dead boy in 'The Right To Grief,' who are \\"glad it is gone, for the rest of the family will now have more to eat and wear\\"), the poems, when read together, take on an oppressively unbalanced character of their own.<br /><br />In 'A Fence,' for example, \\"the rabble and all vagabonds and hungry men and wandering children looking for a place to play\\" stand outside the gates of a newly constructed \\"stone house on the lake front\\" built by a wealthy man, who, the poet infers, can be nothing but immoral, amoral, or corrupt. In the author's Usher-esque vision, nothing will be able to pass through the gates to the property except \\"Death and the Rain and Tomorrow.\\" And tomorrow, for such a corrupt individual or family, will inevitably bring nothing but waves of bad conscience and fevered isolation. 'Soiled Dove' examines the life of a woman who \\"was not a harlot until she married a corporation lawyer,\\" but who automatically becomes one by acquiescing to such a marriage, and who soon discovers her husband also loves \\"six other women,\\" as if marital infidelity was limited exclusively to the upper economic classes. In contrast, 'Happiness' is confidently represented as \\"a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with their women and children and a keg of beer and an accordion,\\" an image which may seem simultaneously naïve, patronizing, and condescending to many readers.<br /><br />Occasionally, Sandburg wisely acknowledges that some portion of the tragedies of man's existence are simply inherent in the natural human life cycle. \\"The hand of God\\" also comes in for blame in several poems.<br /><br />'Chicago Poems' is most effective when Sandburg bypasses social divisionalism--as he often did in his later volumes of poetry--and simply addresses the everyman in the individual. While these poems are often infused with a lyrical and tender sentimentality slightly reminiscent of James Whitcomb Riley, they also locate and acknowledge the beautiful within the tragedies that perpetually arise from human frailty, vulnerability, and mortality. In 'Dream In The Dusk,' the author warns that \\"tears and loss and broken dreams may find your heart at dusk,\\" while 'Under The Harvest Moon' identifies \\"Death\\" as \\"the gray mocker, [who] comes to you as a beautiful friend who remembers.\\" 'I Sang' describes a lover who has given up his heart to \\"you and the moon,\\" but \\"only the moon remembers, and is kind to me.\\"<br /><br />Other poems have the more pronounced folk character of Sandburg's later volumes. The speaker in 'Theme In Yellow' is the pumpkin, who celebrates the paganistic dance of children around him \\"on the last day of October...singing ghost songs and love to the harvest moon...I am the jack-o-lantern with terrible teeth and the children know I am fooling.\\"<br /><br />The most recent edition of 'The Complete Poems of Carl Sandburg' (2003), which contains 'Chicago Poems' in its entirety, is 832 pages long, and provides its readership with the full range of Sandburg's original and often gloriously rich and sensual vision of life. It also contains works like 'At The Gates of Tombs,' from Slabs of the Sunburnt West (1922), in which Sandburg, \\"the crazy wild dreamer,\\" more fully and maturely developed his political vision.

Sadly, it's been over a decade since Paglia released her last full length book, 1994's 'Vamps & Tramps.' But considered in any light, 'Break, Blow, Burn: Camille Paglia Reads Forty Three Of The World's Best Poems' (2005) is a terrible disappointment, as the volume that falls flat in every regard. Since Paglia has spent a fair amount of her career pillorying the mediocre work of other writers and academics, there may be very little sympathy for the book in any quarter.<br /><br />\\"Intended for a general audience,\\" the volume exams forty three short-many very short--and poorly selected poems in strictly pedestrian fashion, making it difficult to believe that the book was authored by the same fearless trailblazer who wrote 'Sexual Personae' (1990), \\"Junk Bonds and Corporate Raiders: Academe In The Hour of the Wolf\\" (1992), and \\"No Law in the Arena\\" (1994).<br /><br />Ignoring Byron, Poe, Meredith, Lawrence, Eliot, Pound, H.D., and Ginsberg, 'Break, Blow, Burn' teems with the tepid examples of the work of Wallace Stevens, William Carlos Williams, Theodore Roethke, Frank O'Hara, May Swenson, and Gary Snyder instead. Two Stevens and two Williams poems are included; Roethke is allowed three. If more than three-fourths of these poems represent \\"the world's best poems,\\" then poetry as a form barely seems worth considering. It may be that Paglia's substantial analyses of Eliot, Lawrence, Pound, H.D., Ginsberg and others have been saved for the second volume of 'Sexual Personae.'<br /><br />Walt Whitman's \\"Song of Myself\\" is present--but only the first and twenty fourth verses. Important works like Blake's \\"The Chimney Sweeper,\\"  Shelley's \\"Ozymandias,\\" and Coleridge's \\"Kubla Khan\\" are considered, but Paglia's reading of each is juiceless, unilluminating, and very reminiscent of the high WASP style she has so long decried. Paglia's argument as to why Yeats' 'Leda and the Swan' can be \\"considered the greatest poem of the 20th century\\" is unpersuasive; the assertion itself may seem ludicrous to many.<br /><br />The volume's biggest problem is that it is simply unstimulating. Nowhere in evidence is the fiery intelligence, wit, and acuity that has been the hallmark of her usually exceptional work. The casual man who is not a poetry reader will be unlikely to become one after reading 'Break, Blow, Burn,' especially since more than half of the poems examined--such as O'Hara's \\"A Mexican Guitar\\" and Roethke's \\"Cuttings\\"--will be of little interest to general audiences.<br /><br />With the current takeover of the internet by the erotic, the tumultuous state of the arts and media, and the precarious condition of world politics, there is abundant cultural material for Paglia to essay as she has in the past. By comparison, 'Break, Blow, Burn' represents a sterile, boring, and dry riverbed.decried.

A parody of the \\"the Chicago school of literature\\" and especially of Sherwood Anderson's 'Dark Laughter' (1925), the book is simultaneously a short story, a novella, and a false novel fragment that haphazardly exams the lives of Scripps O'Neill and his acquaintance Yogi Johnson, two rambling dreamers who represent the American everyman.<br /><br />As a light-hearted attack on the sentimentality and conceptualization of the \\"American Dream\\" in the literature it parodies, the book presents Scripps as a reverie-addicted individual who is consistently but unknowingly his own worst enemy. Earnestly obsessed with self definition and struggling to grasp the larger picture in any given situation, no matter how inconsequential or obvious, Scripps lives in a constant rhetorical haze. Perceiving unbounded potential everywhere, Scripps is actually able to concretize very little. Like his friend, the more prosaic Yogi finds his illusory assumptions about life and other people flatly shot down at every turn.<br /><br />In a hilarious series of fugue states, Scripps indulges in dramatic false memories of being present while his ancestral home is burned to the ground during the Civil War, of his childhood as a starving urchin on the streets of Chicago, and of the social prominence of his forbears. Forgetting that it was Yogi, not himself, who visited Paris during the Great War, Scripps longs to make a return visit.<br /><br />Gloriously unsophisticated and uneducated, Scripps deduces that becoming a world-renowned composer is simply a matter of getting the job. Sensing the power and esteem attributed to words in the highest circles of society, Scripps adopts a cultish attitude towards famous writers and literature, and imagines himself to be a great novelist who has merely failed to commit pen to page.<br /><br />Like Bruce Dudley and Sponge Martin, Anderson's Scripps and Yogi prototypes, the Hemingway protagonists anxiously fixate on questions concerning masculinity, sexual identity, physical prowess, and the threatening presence of the creative impulse in the psyche of the American male.<br /><br />But Scripps and Yogi are also endearing, small town folk heroes clearly not to be despised, for almost every character in 'The Torrents of Spring' lives in the same fog-bound world of misread signs and naivet&eacute;. These include elderly British waitress Mrs. Scripps, who desperately subscribes to elitist literary journals in the hopes of \\"keeping her man,\\" and the foreman of the local pump plant, who is continuously unable to determine with absolute certainty whether \\"the chinook wind,\\" the harbinger of spring, is actually blowing or not.<br /><br />The title of 'Dark Laughter' had several meanings, the most literal of which referred to the \\"high shrill laughter of the negroes,\\" which, Anderson said \\"must always be imagined at the back of the story.\\"<br /><br />Hemingway pushes Anderson's metaphor as hard as he possibly can, and thus one of two Black characters in 'The Torrents of Spring' manifests as nothing but a disembodied voice continually in the throws of howling offstage laughter. Hemingway corrects Anderson by portraying both his Black characters--a cook and a bartender--as the only two people who comprehend the absurdity of the events unfolding around them.<br /><br />Hemingway's genius was to immediately perceive and respond to the multiple unintentionally amusing qualities in the Anderson novel, especially since Anderson was, at the time, the well-respected author of 'Winesburg, Ohio' (1919), and Hemingway, then an unknown, was shortly to become the globally-recognized voice of American literature.<br /><br />Through subtle recreation, Hemingway beautifully punctures such 'Dark Laughter' passages as \\"words flitting across the mind of Bruce Dudley, varnishing wheels in the factory of the Grey Wheel Company of Old Harbor, Indiana. Thoughts flitting across his mind. Drifting images. He had begun to get a little skill with his fingers. Could one in time get a little skill with thoughts, too?\\" Few readers will be surprised to learn that 'Dark Laughter' has been out of print for decades.<br /><br />There's little doubt that Hemingway loved Scripps and Yogi; his appreciation of both is abundantly evident on every page, providing the text with an ironic sentimental glow of its own. As a result, it is surprising that 'The Torrents of Spring' isn't longer. At eighty-seven disciplined pages, readers may wish that the adventures of these two remarkable men, each of whom is perennially caught in the headlights of life, continued on.flitting across the mind of Bruce Dudley, varnishing wheels in the factory of the Grey Wheel Company of Old Harbor, Indiana.

Tripp's 'The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln' (2005) should keep in mind that Tripp, a former Kinsey researcher, was also the author of the astute, ground-breaking 'The Homosexual Matrix' (1975), a comprehensive study which had almost as much to say that was new about heterosexuality as it did about its title subject.<br /><br />Tripp died in 2003, before completing the final manuscript of 'The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln,' and, as his publisher notes, it is likely--probably very likely--that Tripp would have continued to work on the project.<br /><br />In its present form, despite a sound introduction by Mary Todd Lincoln scholar Jean Baker and brief \\"reactions and comments\\" by two historians and a psychologist, 'The Intimate World of Abraham Lincoln,' while interesting, is scattered, fragmentary, and unpersuasive.<br /><br />Tripp makes a number of obvious mistakes while building his thesis that Lincoln was predominantly homosexual (stressing, for example, that Lincoln's habit of closing his letters to Joshua Fry Speed with the words \\"yours forever\\" was significant, when, in fact, Lincoln closed his letters to many people with those words) and, unsurprisingly, offers no unequivocal proof.<br /><br />Tripp partially bases his conclusions on the fact that Lincoln willingly shared beds with two different men--close friend Joshua Fry Speed and bodyguard C. M. Derickson--for extended periods over the course of his life. But only an objective, lengthy, and exhaustive study of the sleeping habits of the period--during which entire pioneer families often shared beds and lived together in tiny, cramped, and cold one-room cabins--could genuinely shed light on whether or not Lincoln's behavior was in any way telling or unusual. Since adolescent brothers and sisters often slept together, and mothers and fathers with their children, a study of the records of frontier incest, if any, would also be instructive.<br /><br />Tripp's conclusion that Lincoln experienced puberty at the remarkably young age of nine--thus making him ripe for early, perhaps homosexual, physical encounters--is another matter which can be widely interpreted, depending on how an individual chooses to read the evidence. Tripp's statement that Lincoln, via self-manipulation, had \\"already arrived at his own powerful pleasures of orgasm...and loved it\\" is clearly nothing but speculation.<br /><br />Like the body of the text, the conflicting contributions by Jean Baker, Michael Burlingame, Michael B. Chesson, and Alice Fennessey fluctuate between bedrock fact, common sense, personal if educated opinion, speculation, and assumption.<br /><br />Since even the matter of whether Lincoln's well-documented marriage was a happy or a miserable one cannot be agreed upon by Lincoln scholars, there seems little hope that there will ever be accord regarding the more obscure--and exceedingly controversial--matter of his sexual nature. By the book's end, it is impossible to arrive at an assured, rational conclusion about any of its specific topics, and thus the reasonable assumption that Lincoln was heterosexual, or predominantly so, will most likely continue to hold sway.<br /><br />The overall impression the book enforces is that human sex and gender studies are, sadly, still in their formative stages.<br /><br />As Camille Paglia wrote in 'Vamps & Tramps' (1994), \\"At the end of the Christian millennium and the century of Freud, sex is still shrouded in mystery. A question mark hangs over every important sexual issue. Despite bitter public controversy and heated private debate, we have no answers.

Indeed, we have barely begun to formulate the questions accurately.\\"	2005-03-21

Grouped in accordance with the four seasons, the valley--a cradle of American history and folklore, and home to Ichabod Crane and Rip Van Winkle--is alternately revealed in all its lush beauty, majesty, and haunted, twilit power.<br /><br />Originally taken in black and white, Lichens, inspired by the Hudson River School Painters, has hand tinted each with \\"French watercolor pencils, pastels, and oil crayons\\" and then further \\"digitally manipulated\\" the images.<br /><br />The results would probably have been far more powerful had Lichens let the original photographs speak for themselves, since the enhancement process greatly reduces their overall power in every instance.<br /><br />Though the palate of the winter landscapes are suitably muted, the artifice is immediately and awkwardly apparent in most of the others. The overall effect is not one of subtle or studied romance, but of an easy-access pleasantness which reduces the images to the level of Sierra Club calendar art.<br /><br />Only tangentially do the colorized photographs, which fairly caricaturize the profound beauty of nature, have any genuine relation to the work of Thomas Cole, Fredric E. Church, and Robert Walter Weir.<br /><br />Lichens has also allowed his spouse, Lois Guarino, to write the introduction, which suggests Guarino may have provided a less than objective appraisal and overview of the book's content.	2005-03-07

In no way a typical celebrity autobiography, 'Tori Amos Piece By Piece' may very well become a standard popular text and survival guide for all those at odds with the dominant and increasingly narrow \\"consensus reality\\" of the West.<br /><br />Though the book, which acknowledges a debt to Carl Jung, lacks the harrowing originality and claustrophobic focus of the Swiss psychologist's 'Memories, Dreams, and Reflections' (1961), it addresses some of the same ground in more brutally honest and plainly spoken language.<br /><br />Like Jung and Scottish novelist Muriel Spark, Amos is unapologetic in her belief that the human race is profoundly rooted in, and a continuous reflection and manifestation of, the Divine. Like those writers, Amos is both a student of and vocal witness to the active presence of Grace in human experience.<br /><br />Amos is a self-identified feminist, and the book consciously addresses women's spirituality and offers numerous practical examples of how Amos has applied her own female-centered belief system throughout her life.<br /><br />However, in the broadest sense, Amos' application of the myths of Demeter, Persephone, and other female deities seems to imply that these apply exclusively to women, when, clearly, the opposite is true. The lesson of Icarus' flight is an archetypal fable that transcends gender, men as well as women experience both actual and symbolic invasions of their public, physical, spiritual, and private beings as Persephone did, and, as in the myth of Demeter, periods of spiritual sterility, inertia, and emptiness are common to both sexes.<br /><br />Amos appears to believe that people are wholly defined, and hence limited to, their gender; proto-feminist Virginia Woolf and the other progressive Bloomsbury intellectuals calmly, confidently, and continuously argued against this for decades.<br /><br />As Amos is clearly well read in a variety of kinds of mysticism, it's unfortunate that she doesn't consider and address the transcendent individual in each person. Spirit, soul, personality, and character exist beyond mere biological gender assignment.<br /><br />This is an important point, since the matter of gender, especially as it relates to aggression, continues to be one of Amos' blind spots. Like many of her musical compositions, from \\"Past the Mission,\\" \\"The Waitress,\\" and \\"Professional Widow\\" to \\"Little Amsterdam,\\" 'Tori Amos: Piece By Piece' is charged throughout with aggression, a self-justifying defensive posture, and an open hostility of its own; as in the past, Amos doesn't seem to realize that most people, regardless of their gender or position within a specific hierarchy, feel equally self-justified when enacting overt or covert hostilities.<br /><br />Thus, at least on the page, Amos frequently seems to lack a firm sense of the relativity of all things, and an understanding that all members of mankind rightly perceive themselves as vulnerable to the continuous waves of cause and effect that is human life. As the example of Amos' own puritanical grandmother should have taught her, any member of mankind, regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender, psychological mindset, or political ideology, is potentially capable of embodying and enacting tyrannical, fascistic, or oppressive attitudes.<br /><br />A careful, inclusive study of the Greek and Roman myths clearly  underscores this point (it was, after all, the female Athena who transformed Medusa from a \\"beautiful maiden\\" into a \\"terrible monster), which Ann Powers addresses when she writers, \\"Feminine power is not only a warm, nurturing thing. Furious goddesses have transformed the world since ancient times, laying waste to man's corruption, wreaking havoc until justice is served.\\"<br /><br />But here Powers indulges in wishful thinking and makes the same mistake that Amos does by suggesting that women--and ancient goddesses and other female archetypes of all stripes and colors--are predominantly benign and nurturing in essence.<br /><br />Jane Harrison, Carl Jung, Eric Neumann, and a host of others have written at length about negative aspect of the Female Imago or the terrifying Devouring Mother of biological fact, which eats or otherwise destroys some or all of its young when unable to care for them due to disease, famine, draught, or other natural catastrophe. It is simply incorrect to state that all or most female aggression is pure reactivity to oppressive male behavior and thus at least marginally justified; Freud's extensive work in infant and children psychology pointedly proves otherwise.<br /><br />Feminist scholars such as Margaret A. Murray and Camille Paglia have, to varying degrees, celebrated the fact that women have an intrinsic capacity for destruction and rapacity--just as men do. Paglia's interpretation of \\"Mother Nature\\" as indifferent at best to human life and suffering--a position underscored by the recent Tsunami disaster in Asia--is also instructive.<br /><br />Even Kate Bush, who Amos has publically acknowledged as an early influence, released \\"Mother Stands For Comfort\\" on 1985's 'The Hounds Of Love,' a song which depicts an archetypal \\"Smothering Mother\\" nurturing and protecting the human killing machine which has sprung from her womb.<br /><br />'Tori Amos Piece By Piece' is occasionally marred when Powers objectifies Amos to too great a degree, which makes Amos sound as if she belongs alone on a very high pedestal; such language violates the otherwise genuinely human quality that dominates the text.

Partially inspired by the events and the political repercussions of Watergate, 'The Abbess of Crewe' transposes the narrative to a Catholic convent in England, where a small cabal of elitist nuns, blinded by power and a foolish faith in their own impervious superiority, has seized control of the abbey through a startling and inventive series of Machiavellian maneuvers.<br /><br />The novel is complexly shaded, and thus mischievous Alexandra, the abbess of the title, and her scheming cohorts, Walburga and Mildred, are the novel's protagonists despite their gross cruelty and self-centeredness.<br /><br />Looking forward to today's world of continuous public video surveillance, Alexandra and her inner circle have, regardless of the fact that the convent observes medieval standards, wired the entire facility so that there is no place in which the other nuns cannot be eavesdropped upon or monitored. Hilariously, the abbess and her inner circle enjoy pate and champagne in their sumptuously decorated observation room, while the rank and file members of the order, whom they privately hold in gleeful contempt, endure meals of hot water, boiled nettles, and cat food without complaint or awareness.<br /><br />Spark is unsparing in her depiction of both Alexandra's sense of superiority, which approaches the predestined, and the mindless idiocy and gullibility of the common nuns in the pew, who clearly represent the average man, ripe for manipulation, exploitation, and programming.<br /><br />Like Spark's 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1962) and 'The Takeover' (1976) among others, 'The Abbess of Crewe' is another extraordinarily deft examination of political and personal power struggles and the methods in which politics really operate within ostensibly gentile, mannered, and \\"correct\\" hierarchies.<br /><br />Alexandra and her confidantes are blissfully aware that they are capable of the very vices they publicly decry in the \\"vulgar\\" \\"common\\" nuns; but serene deportment, assured speech, personal charisma, and effortless presentation are, in their eyes, inherent manifestations of individual and spiritual nobility, and not only take precedence in all situations, but firmly override the possibilities of sin and wrongdoing in the elect.<br /><br />Alexandra's outrageously barbed and salty language behind closed doors--\\"A Jesuit, or any priest for that matter, would be the last man I would elect to be laid by. A man who undresses, maybe; but one who unfrocks, no\\"--is one of the highlights of 'The Abbess of Crewe.'<br /><br />Interestingly, the corrupt and delusional Abbess appears to lose control of both \\"history and mythology\\" as the narrative winds to a close, going so far as to throw her co-conspirators to the wolves when the need to do so arises. But Alexandra never loses her regal bearing or quiet sense of self-justifying divine grace and privilege, and, Spark hints, probably never will.fully aware that they are capable of the very vices they publicly decry in the \\"vulgar\\" \\"common\\" nuns; but serene deportment, assured speech, personal charisma, and effortless presentation are, in their eyes, inherent manifestations of individual and spiritual nobility, and not only take precedence in all situations, but firmly override the possibilities of sin and wrongdoing in the elect.<br /><br />Alexandra's outrageously barbed and salty language behind closed doors--\\"A Jesuit, or any priest for that matter, would be the last man I would elect to be laid by.

Back in print after a quarter of a century, Andrew Birkin's 'J. M. Barrie & the Lost Boys: The Love Story That Gave Birth To Peter Pan' (1979) is a mesmerizing and genuinely tragic book that succeeds on every level. As the title suggests, the book is not only a biography of Scottish playwright and novelist J. M. Barrie, but of the Llewelyn Davies family, whose five sons, with Barrie's dead brother, David, inspired the creation Peter Pan, one of Western literature's most enduring and suitably timeless figures.<br /><br />By drawing heavily on Barrie's notebooks as well as his and the Llewelyn Davies family's letters and other correspondence, the text allows the large cast of participants to tell their story in piecemeal fashion. The result, which resembles an elaborate mosaic, is a poignant reflection on tragic events, both those which might have been averted and those, like disease and the Great War, which could not have been.<br /><br />'J. M. Barrie & the Lost Boys' is also an excellent illustration of Freud's theory of 'family romance' in both its constructive and destructive aspects. The sentimental Barrie was deeply tied to and haunted by his own familial relationships, a psychology he brought to and projected upon the Llewelyn Davies family after becoming enchanted by two of their young boys in Kensington Gardens. Barrie was a middle aged and childless man, if a very successful one, at that time in his life, and his manipulative and interloping intrusion into the family has been a subject of speculation by historians and literary scholars ever since.<br /><br />Though ostensibly nothing less than financially generous and well-intentioned, as Humphrey Carpenter illustrated in 'Secret Gardens' (1985), even Barrie's earliest work inspired by the Llewelyn Davies boys, 'The Little White Bird' (1902, later reissued as 'Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens'), contained material which suggested that Barrie's fascination with the boys was potentially inappropriate.<br /><br />In one passage, a very young boy, modeled on George Llewelyn Davies, invites himself into a grown man's bed with language that is simultaneously seductive, hesitant, and tender.  The narrator, who stands in for Barrie, accepts the boy's invitation, stating, \\"It is what I have been wanting all the time,\\" like a breathless and succumbing lover. Climbing into bed, the young boy then sleeps \\"on and across\\" the narrator, \\"retains possession\\" of the man's \\"finger,\\" and \\"occasionally\\" awakens him to assert that \\"he was sleeping with me.\\"<br /><br />So obsessively tied to the Llewelyn Davies boys was Barrie that when his favorite, the sensitive, brilliant, and troubled Michael, drowned under unusual circumstances at 17, Birkin is accurately able to state that Barrie's life was now rendered \\"utterly pointless\\" without him; Barrie's comment was \\"for ever and ever I am thinking of him.\\"<br /><br />Though Michael undoubtedly loved Barrie, he was plagued by night terrors throughout his boyhood, which may have possibly arisen not only from Barrie's passive-aggressive takeover of the boy's family, but from Barrie's own narrowly fixated and smothering love.<br /><br />After mother Sylvia Llewelyn Davies' early death, Barrie went so far as to misrepresent  her will in such a manner as to give himself duo guardianship over the children. Not surprisingly, two of the boys, Jack and Peter, neither of whom were Barrie favorites, eyed him with increasing suspicion and thinly-veiled hostility as they grew into adolescence and beyond.<br /><br />Barrie, however, was not the only presence in the boys' lives guided by  inappropriately managed emotion: in later years, their beloved nanny, Mary Hodgson, who detested Barrie and fought a protracted cold war with him over the boys' affections for years, eventually refused to acknowledge their young wives with such vehemence that she induced a miscarriage in one, before finally acknowledging her jealousy and surrendering her position.<br /><br />Part of the sadness inherent in 'J. M. Barrie & the Lost Boys' is the genuine tragedy that arises, against the backdrops of Kensington Gardens, Eton, and the London theater, from the unrelenting destruction of the high Edwardian ideals and genuinely noble characters that most of those involved embodied.<br /><br />As the numerous photographs attest, the early life of the handsome Llewelyn Davies family was loving, hopeful, relatively prosperous, and enchanted, but the coming years brought disfigurement from facial tumors, cancer, the boys orphaned at early ages, the deaths of vital family members in War World I, and at least one verifiable suicide among them. Barrie's apparently celibate marriage collapsed, and a key figure in his personal and professional life died during the sinking of the Lusitania.<br /><br />Amidst these tragedies and those of Barrie's youth arose the transcendent figure of Peter Pan, the apparently indestructible boy who, by willfully failing to mature, believes he has discovered a means of permanently avoiding the tragedies inherent in the normal cycle of  life.<br /><br />But wayward, thoughtless, selfish, and repeatedly manifesting other unmistakable signs of sociopathology, the deluded Peter in fact only condemns himself to an existence of eternal isolation and the repetitious loss of those he chooses as companions, as 'Peter And Wendy' (1911, reissued as 'Peter Pan and Wendy' in 1921 and eventually as 'Peter Pan') makes evident in the passage in which the Darling children finally return to their parents from the Neverland: \\"There could not have been a lovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a strange boy who was staring in at the window. He had ecstasies innumerable that other children can never know; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from which he must be forever barred.\\"<br /><br />An even more grueling scene follows in the final chapter, in which, years later, the unreflective Peter visits Wendy, expecting to find a young girl, only to be confronted by a mature women, with children of her own, standing in a dimly-lit room. Vaguely sensing the truth, \\"at last a fear assailed him,\\" leading Peter to cry out, in a telling phrase that applies to 'J. M.

Kinsey	Books	4	32	33	N	N	When Ignorance Isn't Bliss	Jonathan Gathorne-Hardy's 'Kinsey: Sex: The Measure of All Things' (2000) is a balanced, insightful, and fairly thorough biography of the controversial Indiana biologist who pioneered the study of human sexuality in the United States during the Forties and Fifties.<br /><br />Those distressed with the continuing tragic state of social discourse concerning sexuality in America will find Gathorne-Hardy's book courageous, invigorating, and wonderfully plain spoken on a variety of topics most Americans still can't discuss, publicly or privately, without demonstrating shame, rage, or the kind of psychological hysteria and displacement that created the 'satanic ritual abuse' scare--which ruined thousands of lives on both sides of the Atlantic--during the Eighties and Nineties.<br /><br />If human sexuality is \\"the measure of all things,\\" then it is also inherently a subject of enormous power for most and extreme sensitivity for many, and is likely to remain so throughout much of America for the foreseeable future. Despite the ubiquity of sexual content in the entertainment world and on the internet today, a reactionary backlash has certainly been asserting itself since the Sexual Revolution of the Sixties, most insidiously via the \\"political correctness\\" of the hypocritical elite media, governmental social welfare institutions, and college campus policy boards.<br /><br />Thus, while many may initially find the reformist scientist a hero, the eccentricities and excesses of his professional and personal behavior will undoubtedly make many initially open minded readers wince in discomfort as the Kinsey story progresses. His theories in support of adult/child sexual interaction, for instance, are, tellingly, only marginally explored by Gathorne-Hardy, and Kinsey's obsessive search for personal sexual satisfaction, which led him to what many will interpret as self-mutilating activities, may be seen as signs of pathology by even the sophisticated general reader.<br /><br />Alfred Kinsey was a driven man in every major aspect of his existence, and moderation, balance, and other disciplines of self control were not qualities he advocated for the public or usually practiced himself where sexual activity was concerned. Had Kinsey been more intrinsically conservative in his private behavior, it is likely that many more people today would feel at ease with his work and be able to embrace it wholeheartedly. But Kinsey's solitary sexual habits are unlikely to gain him a broad sympathetic audience in either a personal or professional capacity.<br /><br />The simple truth, which Kinsey was well aware of, is that full public disclosure of personal sexual practices, even those that are the most common, will probably never sit well psychologically with most members of Western societies. Kinsey had one of the highest public profiles of his era, and must have realized that his own sexual history would eventually become public knowledge and inevitably discredit him in the court of public opinion, which may partially explain the paranoia of his last years.<br /><br />As Gathorne-Hardy emphasizes repeatedly, Kinsey's work--which amounted to a personal crusade--was largely motivated by his own puritanical religious upbringing and the sexual frustration that resulted from it. His subsequent sexual interaction with some of the private citizens whose histories he documented, as well as with his own professional staff, underscore the common sense concern that the researcher's occasionally intimate approach potentially contaminated his data and compromised his ability to remain object. However, Kinsey's findings have held up statistically over the ensuing decades and compared favorably with subsequent research.<br /><br />'Kinsey: Sex: The Measure of All Things' offers a remarkable reading experience, especially as Kinsey and most of his professional colleagues--and their spouses--regularly engage in all varieties of hetero-and homosexual acts with one anotherin the name of education, experience, and sheer unadorned sensual pleasure.<br /><br />Handsome, perennially youthful assistant Wardell Pomeroy, who considered himself predominantly heterosexual, stands out as a kind of boundary-jumping erotic hero, doing \\"a certain eye and swagger thing\\" under Kinsey's auspices which enabled him to \\"pick up anyone,\\" and who was, with equally married coworker Clyde Martin, a consistent sexual partner of Kinsey's for almost a decade.<br /><br />Kinsey's long physical relationship with subordinate Clyde Martin is one of the book's weaknesses, since almost all dynamics, details, and specific facts are strangely absent; nothing of Martin's perspective on the relationship is conveyed except his apparently contented sexual acquiescence to his employer and friend.<br /><br />Gathorne-Hardy also carefully builds up events leading to Kinsey's physical and professional relationship with onetime romantic partners Glenway Wescott and Monroe Wheeler, but the resulting events are unexceptional, and, by that point in Kinsey's life, seem to have been strictly routine. Gathorne-Hardy's presentation of both these affairs suggests, rightly or wrongly, that there is something more to be told in both cases than the author has revealed.<br /><br />Since the period in which Kinsey was most active professionally is generally thought of as aggressively repressive and conservative, readers may be surprised at the apparent ease with which Kinsey seems to have gathered the thousands of personal sexual histories he used as the raw data for his books, especially since these were often obtained from \\"100% groups\\" in which the individual's participation was known to all or most other group members. Though Kinsey repeatedly faced heated criticism from various religious institutions and competitors, in many ways the late Forties - early Fifties world of 'Kinsey: Sex: The Measure of All Things' seems like a more intelligent and enlightened place than America does today.<br /><br />Even in his mundane habits, Alfred Kinsey was an eccentric man, a quality his British biographer seems to share on occasion. Gathorne-Hardy's passage on the \\"appalling\\" and \\"ferocious\\" \\"American climate,\\" in which he practically dismisses the entire North American continent as uninhabitable on the basis of its weather, makes him appear incredibly naïve, as does his footnote on \\"American raisins,\\" which he describes as \\"soft, fruity, luscious lumps, as big as plums\\" rather than \\"hard little bullets,\\" a description that will be news to most readers in the United States.in the name of education, experience, and sheer unadorned sensual pleasure.<br /><br />Handsome, perennially youthful assistant Wardell Pomeroy, who considered himself predominantly heterosexual, stands out as a kind of boundary-jumping erotic hero, doing \\"a certain eye and swagger thing\\" under Kinsey's auspices which enabled him to \\"pick up anyone,\\" and who was, with equally married coworker Clyde Martin, a consistent sexual partner of Kinsey's for almost a decade.<br /><br />Kinsey's long physical relationship with subordinate Clyde Martin is one of the book's weaknesses, since almost all dynamics, details, and specific facts are strangely absent; nothing of Martin's perspective on the relationship is conveyed except his apparently contented sexual acquiescence to his employer and friend.<br /><br />Gathorne-Hardy also carefully builds up events leading to Kinsey's physical and professional relationship with onetime romantic partners Glenway Wescott and Monroe Wheeler, but the resulting events are unexceptional, and, by that point in Kinsey's life, seem to have been strictly routine.

Hall's 'Thunderbirds: America's Living Legends of Giant Birds' (2004) is a well intentioned but tepid popular study of the history and folklore of the subject.  At 177 light and breezy pages, this material, little of which is new, would have been better suited to a two-part article in Fortean Times. Hall has written about unexplained natural phenomena \\"for more than thirty years,\\" yet the volume isn't a convincing testament of Hall's dedication to his subject; airy and topical, the book, which begs questions at every turn, cries out for a more thorough critical analysis of its subject.<br /><br />More difficult to accept are Hall's careless errors. While John Keel did believe there was a relationship between 'Mothman' and the UFOs reported simultaneously in West Virginia in the 1960s, Keel never claimed that 'Mothman' was \\"something from outer space,\\" a fact that even a cursory reading of 'The Mothman Prophecies' (1975) reveals. In Keel's estimation, not even UFOs originated on another planet.<br /><br />Hall believes that the creature that came to be known as 'Mothman' was a large cryptid owl. But several witnesses reported that the creature, without flapping its wings, rose straight up into the air like a helicopter; how could a large owl, or any other avian creature, take flight in such a manner?  Many witnesses also reported that the creature had clearly defined human-like legs; is Hall's 'giant owl' so anatomically different from typical owls that it fits this description? If so, he doesn't state this clearly.<br /><br />In 'Mothman: The Facts Behind The Legend' (2002), key witness Linda Scarberry said of her first encounter, \\"the body of it ['Mothman'] was like a slender, muscular man, and was flesh-colored.  Its wings looked like angel wings...it had arms and legs, like a muscular man...it had one of its wings caught in a guide wire near a section of road close to the power plant, and was pulling on its wings with its hands, trying to free itself. Its hands were really big.\\"<br /><br />The second time that Scarberry saw the creature, it was sitting on the roof of her home \\"with its arms around its legs and wings folded around itself.\\" Later, upon viewing a \\"huge, white owl\\" that someone had killed in the region, Scarberry stated, \\"I felt like sitting down and crying. You could tell by looking at the owl that it wasn't what was being reported. It wasn't nearly as big, and it was a bird. What we saw was no bird, much less an owl or a crane. Its body wasn't even close to either of those. I could see muscles in the muscles in the arms and legs of the Mothman. They were human-like. Not even close to a bird of any kind.\\" How does Hall reconcile his cryptid owl theory with these and other similar reports? Why doesn't he attempt to?<br /><br />Hall's entire chapter on the giant owl, which he refers to collectively as \\"Bighoot,\\" will be problematic for critical readers. Hall reports that several Indian tribes have legends of their tribes being harassed by a creature they referred to as \\"Flying Head\\" or \\"Big Head\\"; these were literally huge heads without torsos that were covered with long hair. In what sense could these mythological, perhaps metaphorical, creatures have been giant owls? Hall believes that the Indians most likely made the simple error of mistaking the giant owl's feathers for hair, but according to the mythology, this hair was so long that it allowed the creatures to fly in storm winds. Native Americans were generally keen observers of nature, and probably knew an owl, however large, when they saw one.<br /><br />Hall also quotes West Virginian history professor James Gay Jones' account of \\"a large bird with the head of a man\\" as further possible evidence for Bighoot, but completely neglects to address the matter of the reported human head. Though Hall states that the giant owl \\"would stand several feet tall,\\" he quotes a woman who reported two sightings of \\"9-10 feet high\\" owl without even attempting to explain this radical variation in size. If some giant owls are \\"several feet tall\\" while others are \\"9-10 feet,\\" so large that they can easily be mistaken for leafless trees in winter, then 'Thunderbirds' is certainly the place in which Hall should have addressed this important discrepancy.<br /><br />Hall also quotes Betty Sturgeon, whom Hall says \\"came forth with a story to tell about killing a giant owl at the time of the Mothman excitement decades ago,\\" but nowhere in the quoted Herald-Dispatch article does Sturgeon herself say that the creature her husband shot and killed was an owl of any kind. The reporter, Bob Withers, only states that Sturgeon \\"recalls glancing at some kind of big bird.\\"  Elsewhere, Withers refers to the animal as \\"it\\" and as \\"the creature.\\" Clearly, if the article specifically referred to an owl, regardless of size, that portion of the story should have been quoted in full.<br /><br />The \\"Flatwoods Monster\\" witnessed in Braxton County, West Virginia in 1952 has famously been explained away by CSICOP's Joe Nickel as being a large owl, a theory that dovetails nicely with the more conservative aspects of Hall's Bighoot theory, so why does this fascinating case go completely unaddressed, when a cautious reading of it would only bolster Hall's giant owl argument?<br /><br />Elsewhere, Hall reports that \\"the Quinault Indians found a live whale still thrashing in the mountains and observed the gradual deterioration of its corpse\\" and that \\"whales marked by talons have also been reported found in trees.\\" Are readers to believe that thunderbirds can grow large enough to pluck whales out of the ocean? Discussing a 1977 amateur film of possible thunderbirds in flight, Hall states, \\"perhaps one day a more broad-minded consideration and careful scrutiny of this film will be productive.\\" Why hasn't Hall assumed this responsibility?<br /><br />Since the disappointing 'Thunderbirds' reads like a cryptozoological primer, the book is best suited to those new to the field.xplain this radical variation in size.

Upon meeting Wright and her mother, some people thought them a lesbian couple rather than a mother and daughter, while Dare and Blaine, meeting again after over twenty years of separation, considered marrying one another and simply hiding their sibling relationship from the world.<br /><br />As presented, the story of Wright's life continually approaches the pathological without ever irrevocably crossing the line; prevailing WASP social protocols, conventions, and mores of the era apparently protected Wright and her family from public as well as private exposure, though the preponderance of their friends seemed to sense something bizarre was occurring, decade after decade, without ever confronting the Wrights or asking the kind of impolite if common sense questions that would have exposed the family's incest-leaning eccentricities.<br /><br />Nathan herself frequently seems strangely complicit in this peculiar arrangement; though she mentions that mother and daughter slept in the same bed whenever together throughout their lifetimes, it is only in a very late chapter that the reader learns that mother and daughter not only shared the same bed, but slept tightly wrapped around one another like newlyweds.<br /><br />And while Wright, who never married, may have carried herself with poise and sophistication, the photographic evidence provided does not bolster the argument that Wright was a great beauty, though this seems to have been the prevailing consensus throughout her lifetime, and a belief Nathan shares. The occasionally repulsive photographs reveals a hard-featured, mannish woman who borders on the homely; in some photographs, Wright strongly resembles a transvestite, while in others, she projects a strident, imperious attitude that suggests a compensatory neurosis as well as a deeply rooted narcissism. Unsurprisingly, Wright's beloved alter ego, the toddler-sized doll \\"Edith,\\" who starred in Wright's best selling series of photographic books for children, had the smallest nose imaginable, while Wright's was unmistakably large, thick, and upturned.<br /><br />Wright and her mother professed to live happily in a fantasy world of their own creation, a brittle fairy tale world centered around private, all-night costume parties and compulsive photography sessions. This world quickly collapsed after her mother's death, when Wright sank quickly into lethargy, delusion, and alcoholism. Though Nathan encourages the belief that Wright genuinely suffered from painful social isolation throughout her adult life, the hard facts suggest that Wright lived an enviable life in many ways: she was friends with international social luminaries like Greta Garbo and Gayelord Hauser, was actively pursued by a number of handsome, dedicated, and well placed men, was financially stable, traveled freely around America and to Europe at whim, and seems to have had very little difficulty achieving success as a fashion model, commercial photographer, and author.<br /><br />In fact, 'The Secret Life of the Lonely Doll' repeatedly begs the question of how Wright was able to achieve all that she did in fields not known for sensitivity and subtly if she was as paralyzingly timid, withdrawn, and introverted as Nathan claims. Wright was exceptionally talented, but talent and social connections alone cannot explain how Wright navigated the endless series of auditions, interviews, photo shoots, and business meetings that her multiple careers required over the decades.<br /><br />The blond \\"Edith\\" doll was a multi-prismed reflection of Wright's fixation on her emotionally troubled childhood and broken home; while \\"Edith\\" was partially Wright's idealized doppelganger, the doll's name was identical with her mother's, who was known as \\"Edie\\" rather than Edith, and thus reflected Wright's unusually strong identification with and submersion in her mother. Throughout her adult life, Wright treated \\"Edith\\" like a living creature, conversing with \\"Edith\\" for hours on end and introducing the doll to visitors as if it were alive. Clearly, \\"Edith\\" was a fetish object of inordinate power and fascination for its owner.<br /><br />As a recent article in the New York Times illustrates, some parents and educators today find the influential, recently reprinted Lonely Doll books to be politically incorrect at best and unwholesomely sinister and sadomasochistic at worst. As Nathan makes abundantly clear, the series did reflect Wright's own ominous psychological landscape, but were also clearly vehicles in which she could confront the complexes that ensnared her. Elements of ambiguity and conflict are necessary in all fiction, and each Lonely Doll book eventually achieves a helpful resolution of some kind. The series should be commended for not tacking on standardized, conflict-free happy endings.<br /><br />Spanking, a prominent element in each book, was a commonly accepted method of parental discipline throughout most of Wright's life, and the doll's glamorized and slightly sexualized appearance is no different than the erotically charged decorative cherubs still common at Valentine's Day. Children's literature, from the works of George McDonald, Lewis Carroll, and J.M. Barrie to L. Frank Baum's Oz series and the Dr. Seuss books, have often contained ambiguously threatening elements to which children cheerfully respond; such elements are clearly intended to be correlatives to the sources of anxiety in the child's own life.<br /><br />If Wright's personality ultimately remains elusive, Nathan has done an excellent job of documenting her concealed, secretive, and liminal existence.' repeatedly begs the question of how Wright was able to achieve all that she did in fields not known for sensitivity and subtly if she was as paralyzingly timid, withdrawn, and introverted as Nathan claims.

Arkins' 'Halloween Merrymaking: An Illustrated Celebration of Fun, Food, and Frolics from Halloweens Past' (2004) offers a poignant but hopeful glimpse back into American high culture and the \\"Golden Age of American Halloween,\\" which the author locates between 1870 and the early 1930s.  Today, many deny that such a high culture ever existed in this country, or, if willing to make such an admission, will tar that culture as \\"elitist\\" and \\"oppressive.\\"<br /><br />Yet, at present, Americans everywhere crave a richer, more substantial, and refined existence than the mediocre model that the current popular culture promotes and sustains. 'Halloween Merrymaking' looks back on a time when neighborhood and community, good manners and retail integrity, decorum and propriety, dress and composure, breeding and ingenuity, were all essential and unavoidable aspects of daily American life.<br /><br />Such cultural elements certainly represented strictures in some cases, but the rewards for such discipline was enormous: a thriving, evolving, positivistic, and multi-tiered society that strove to refine and improve itself in any number of ways.<br /><br />Stressing above all that Halloween in the Golden Age was \\"hardly a monster's ball by any stretch of the imagination,\\" Arkins focuses on the holiday as it was celebrated in magazines and periodicals of the era, which subtly dictated the civilized manner in which this most anarchic of American holidays was enjoyed by parents and children alike, whether at family gatherings, church socials, classroom frolics, bridge parties, or comparatively chic adult soirees.<br /><br />While children's party treats include the expected cakes, donuts, and candies brightly wrapped in autumn colors, a typical adult menu unselfconsciously suggests Oyster Canapes, Lobster Bisque, Waldorf Salad, and Broiled Squab.<br /><br />Though the preface states that Halloween Merrymaking is not a \\"how-to manual\\" in the traditional sense, the book has sections lovingly devoted to \\"old fashioned\\" invitations, interior and exterior decoration, party favors, preparation of the party table, menus, costuming, appropriate music, and suitable games such as apple bobbing, nutshell auguries, tea leaf divination, and other forms of fun and fortune telling that have long roots in British history and folklore.<br /><br />Though the finest commercial Halloween decorations, party favors, and costumes of the period are featured and emphasized, there are also numerous suggestions for making comparable items from orange, black, and white crepe paper and cardboard, standard kitchen vegetables, and other readily available materials. Ingenuity, enthusiasm, and a happy \\"can do\\" attitude are underscored throughout. America was largely an agricultural society at this time, a fact the book reflects in a number of meaningful and practical ways.<br /><br />Halloween Merrymaking includes period photographs of parties and costumed partygoers, magazine covers and entire magazine articles (such as 1906's \\"A Jolly Forest Halloween\\" and 1909's \\"Under The Pumpkin Vine At Halloween\\"), and a wide variety of imaginatively depicted period reproductions of witches, jack o' lanterns, black cats, ghosts, harvest moons, owls, and fairies.<br /><br />Highly recommended to those seeking inspiration and a cure for cynicism, apathy, and the present third-rate norm.ns lovingly devoted to \\"old fashioned\\" invitations, interior and exterior decoration, party favors, preparation of the party table, menus, costuming, appropriate music, and suitable games such as apple bobbing, nutshell auguries, tea leaf divination, and other forms of fun and fortune telling that have long roots in British history and folklore.<br /><br />Though the finest commercial Halloween decorations, party favors, and costumes of the period are featured and emphasized, there are also numerous suggestions for making comparable items from orange, black, and white crepe paper and cardboard, standard kitchen vegetables, and other readily available materials.

'All The Stories of Muriel Spark' was published in 2001, 'The Ghost Stories of Muriel Spark' in 2003, both 'All the Poems of Muriel Spark' and a four-novel Modern Library omnibus were published earlier this year, and an idiosyncratic selection of her older fiction is currently in print. 1996 saw the release of 'Reality and Dreams,' one of Spark's rare outright failures, and 'Aiding and Abetting' debuted in 2000. But 'Aiding and Abetting' was sketchy and insubstantial, and something of a failure as well.<br /><br />Thus the good news is that 'The Finishing School' (2004), Spark's 22nd novel, is worthy of taking its place on a lower rung among her second tier works (1958's 'Robinson,' 1960's 'The Ballad of Peckham Rye,' 1968's 'The Public Image,' and 1973's 'The Hothouse By the East River,' among others).<br /><br />Happily, 'The Finishing School' has a brisk tone which most resembles that of 'Territorial Rights' (1979) and the greatly underrated 'Symposium' (1990), and, like those novels, concerns itself largely with life among the wealthy and the privileged. The institution in question is Sunrise College, a mobile school in Switzerland that in any given semester has only a handful of students enrolled. Ironically, Sunrise College never seems entirely credible, and throughout feels exactly like what it is in fact: a convenient and mutable creative device for its author's use.<br /><br />Nonetheless, 'The Finishing School' is a deft, if slight, meditation on creative frustration, envy, competition, and emotional displacement.<br /><br />Rowland Mahler, who teaches creative writing and runs the school with his wife, Nina, is attempting to write his long-planned first novel. But Rowland discovers that one of his young students, seventeen year-old Chris Wiley, has almost completed his own first novel on the life of Mary Queen of Scots. Dazed and dazzled, as is everyone else, by Chris's charm, confidence, productivity, and talent, Rowland finds his own ability to write disappearing, and his lofty private image of himself as an author-to-be suffering painfully.<br /><br />When plucky Chris finds a publisher with apparent ease, Rowland's thwarted creative drive switches gears, transforming into a malevolent obsession with his formerly prized pupil and friend.<br /><br />'The Finishing School' glides effortlessly across its own clever and glossy surfaces, reflecting evidence of Spark's talent, but not her genius. Spark once defended her occasionally harsh treatment of her characters by asserting that \\"they're just words,\\" something certainly true of all the characters here except Rowland and Chris, who tend towards the three dimensional without ever quite arriving there.<br /><br />Over the decades, the author has stated on multiple occasions that her novels are primarily intended as \\"entertainment,\\" and 'The Finishing School,' a novella which casts a very short shadow, does succeed at being that.Mary Queen of Scots.

Formerly known for crisp social satires such as 1905's 'The House of Mirth,' the gripping 'Ethan Frome' understandably met with limited critical and commercial success upon its release.<br /><br />Superbly written, 'Ethan Frome' is almost realistic American fiction at its finest. After the unnamed narrator arrives in the small Massachusetts village of Starkfield at the height of winter, he quickly becomes fascinated with a tall, striking, and partially crippled man, Ethan Frome, that he repeatedly sees moving silently around the landscape. The narrator finds that the friendly local people are willing to speak at length about other matters, but about Ethan Frome he can learn almost nothing.<br /><br />Temporarily hiring Frome to provide him with transportation, he discovers that Frome is an unusually intelligent, intellectually curious, and sensitive man. Caught far from his own home on a freezing night, Frome offers the narrator a night's shelter at his own meager farmhouse, and thus the opportunity for Frome to recount his troubled history is presented. But then the narrator states, \\"It was that night that I found the clue to Ethan Frome, and began to put together this vision of his story.\\" Scholars have subsequently debated why Wharton decided to add this sentence, but all have agreed that, despite its ambiguity, the recounting of Frome's tragic history as given is ultimately an uncertain one.<br /><br />The story as recreated is almost biblically simple: Ethan, who is married to a coarse, domineering, vindictive, and malingering woman, Zenobia, falls in love with his wife's live in servant, Mattie, and Mattie, who is young, beautiful, and innocent, with Ethan. After a tender night alone while Zenobia is away ostensibly seeking a cure for her ailments, Ethan and Mattie desperately attempt to wrest themselves from Zenobia's grasp; but the results of their efforts are horrific.<br /><br />Taking its cues from the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allen Poe, and the Brontes, 'Ethan Frome' offers a comfortless vision of perdition that suggests that hell on earth is the inevitable lot of some.<br /><br />Wharton's sense of integrity ultimately carries the novel, but the book's presentation of an amoral universe, the triumph of evil, and the utter transformation of innocence into what is most repulsive in human existence makes 'Ethan Frome' a work whose conclusions many readers will reject as untenable.<br /><br />The book's inexorable denouement probably explains Wharton's disinclination to attribute the main narrative to Ethan, allow the narrator to it present it as objective if fictional history, or wholly take credit herself. Though the hard facts provided in the book's final pages are undeniably established, the manner in which they are reached is left a matter of ambiguity, suggesting that while the writing of 'Ethan Frome' was probably a cathartic experience for Wharton, she may have also found the final result objectionable, distasteful, or repellant.re for her ailments, Ethan and Mattie desperately attempt to wrest themselves from Zenobia's grasp; but the results of their efforts are horrific.<br /><br />Taking its cues from the work of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edgar Allen Poe, and the Brontes, 'Ethan Frome' offers a comfortless vision of perdition that suggests that hell on earth is the inevitable lot of some.<br /><br />Wharton's sense of integrity ultimately carries the novel, but the book's presentation of an amoral universe, the triumph of evil, and the utter transformation of innocence into what is most repulsive in human existence makes 'Ethan Frome' a work whose conclusions many readers will reject as untenable.<br /><br />The book's inexorable denouement probably explains Wharton's disinclination to attribute the main narrative to Ethan, allow the narrator to it present it as objective if fictional history, or wholly take credit herself.

Scott Fitzgerald published during his lifetime, was something of a critical and commercial failure upon its release at the height of the Depression. Though it has had many prominent public admirers over the decades, the book is a dull, strained, and rambling failure concerned with transparent, narcissistic characters, who, in a later era, might have comfortably stepped out of any of Sidney Sheldon' novels.<br /><br />'Tender Is The Night' is sadly shorn of the maniacal spontaneity of initial Fitzgerald novel 'This Side of Paradise' (1920) and the depth that the first person narrative provided in 'The Great Gatsby' (1925). Though the peripheral characters find protagonists Dr. Dick Diver and his wife, Nicole, to be dazzling, irresistible, and dynamic, on the page they are so blandly drawn that each is barely discernable from the rest of the equally nondescript cast.<br /><br />Diver, who is supposed to be a reputable psychiatrist, simply appears like a slightly more dapper cad among cads, and something of a fool.<br /><br />The lives of these affluent men and women seem empty indeed; when not flattering one another or merrily drawing a firm line of exclusivity between themselves and the rest of humanity, the characters amuse themselves by making cutting and sardonic remarks about the hoi polloi. Shallow good manners, rather than substantive values, fuel their lives.<br /><br />The extroverted Dick and Nicole Diver are initially portrayed as compulsive socializers who are locked into their public personas, which fit them as snugly as straight jackets; left alone together, the silence is deafening and the minutes yawn.<br /><br />As if suffering an ethical failure, Fitzgerald appears to hold his unlikable characters and their lifestyles in high esteem, a factor that finally damns the book completely, since the collapse of Diver's sunlit house of cards is meant to represent a poignant tragedy.<br /><br />Though some scholars believe that struggling Depression audiences simply weren't capable of focusing on a novel about the lives of the wealthy, the more probable reason is that the book is unenjoyable and feels concocted and self conscious at every turn.<br /><br />And with good reason: during the period in which the book was written, Fitzgerald continually rearranged the novel's plot, theme, and focus as his own life became increasingly troubled and unsettled. This uneven patchwork approach is evident in both large and small ways, such as when naive but poised Hollywood ingenue Rosemary leaves a party and is inexplicably \\"shaken with audibly painful sobs,\\" though four short, uneventful paragraphs later on the same page, Fitzgerald writes, \\"it was time for Rosemary to cry,\\" apparently forgetting that Rosemary is crying already.<br /><br />Throughout Book One, Fitzgerald moves haphazardly from vaguely-conceived scene to scene, overwriting but still failing to include the essential, and thus allowing what little credible plot there is to evaporate like a mirage.<br /><br />Contrived set pieces involving a duel, a railway shooting, and a murder in a hotel--none of which add anything pertinent the plot--suggest that Fitzgerald simply didn't know how to proceed or express what he wanted to say.<br /><br />Throughout Book One, the omnipresent narrator's point of view, like the characters whose story he relates, is pretentious and smugly inauthentic; Abe North's mouth, for example, is characterized in terms of its \\"inability to endure boredom,\\" while in another scene, the group, eyeing the casual behavior of strangers, discusses the reasons why Diver \\"is the only sober man\\" in the world capable of \\"repose,\\" a quality they apparently hold in inestimable regard.<br /><br />When Diver is briefly accosted by a strange man while waiting on a Paris street corner, rather than state this plainly, Fitzgerald writes, \\"After three-quarters of an hour of standing around, he became suddenly involved in a human contact.\\"<br /><br />Though a discernable plot remains elusive and the characters are ghostly and insubstantial, Fitzgerald repeatedly focuses on the extraneous: when Diver scribbles out a check drawn from questionable funds, Fitzgerald writes, \\"As he wrote he engrossed himself in the material act, examining meticulously the pen, writing laboriously upon the high glass-topped desk.\\"<br /><br />The more prosaically written Book Two reveals that Fitzgerald had little genuine insight or hard knowledge about psychology, despite references to Freud, Jung, Bleuler, and Adler, though he continues to offer poorly expressed pseudo-philosophical insights such as \\"He knew, though, that the price of his intactness was incompleteness.\\"<br /><br />Not only does Fitzgerald make the common mistake of identifying schizophrenia as \\"split personality,\\" but the closest the author comes in attempting to describe mental illness is \\"a cousin happened upon her mad and gone.\\"<br /><br />As if hoping to correct the structural errors of the first section, Book Two compresses so much explicit activity in its pages that events degenerate into a series of convenient and unbelievable coincidences. There are passages of unintentional hilarity, such as \\"He was beaten to death in a speakeasy in New York. He just managed to crawl home to the Racquet Club to die,\\" suggesting that even on the very lip of perdition, Fitzgerald's diehard characters are glorious snobs to the end.<br /><br />With 'Tender Is The Night,' Fitzgerald played an ostensibly clever, dangerous, and deceptive game. The omnipresent narrator's point of view in Book One is clearly colored by Rosemary's naive and idealized perception of the Divers, thus making the objective truth about the couple impossible to ascertain.<br /><br />Book Two, which adopts an entirely more factual tone, then peels away the false and badly-expressed glamour and purports to reveal the rot beneath the shimmering surface.<br /><br />But Rosemary's presence doesn't explain Book One's narrative pretensions or the manner in which Fitzgerald has misled the reader in an attempt to produce what he calculates will later become a tragically ironic effect.<br /><br />But since the lives the Divers appear to lead in Book One is spurious at best, Fitzgerald's gambit falls flat.r of standing around, he became suddenly involved in a human contact.\\"<br /><br />Though a discernable plot remains elusive and the characters are ghostly and insubstantial, Fitzgerald repeatedly focuses on the extraneous: when Diver scribbles out a check drawn from questionable funds, Fitzgerald writes, \\"As he wrote he engrossed himself in the material act, examining meticulously the pen, writing laboriously upon the high glass-topped desk.\\"<br /><br />The more prosaically written Book Two reveals that Fitzgerald had little genuine insight or hard knowledge about psychology, despite references to Freud, Jung, Bleuler, and Adler, though he continues to offer poorly expressed pseudo-philosophical insights such as \\"He knew, though, that the price of his intactness was incompleteness.\\"<br /><br />Not only does Fitzgerald make the common mistake of identifying schizophrenia as \\"split personality,\\" but the closest the author comes in attempting to describe mental illness is \\"a cousin happened upon her mad and gone.\\"<br /><br />As if hoping to correct the structural errors of the first section, Book Two compresses so much explicit activity in its pages that events degenerate into a series of convenient and unbelievable coincidences.

US	35944741	R2TTRDK6EK13SM	1560975423	518960544	Devil in Design: Krampus	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Hellfire For Christmas	Monte Beauchamp's dazzling 'The Devil in Design: The Krampus Postcards' (2004) is a collection of 147 vintage images of the dark and Pan-like Krampus, who, with his guiding companion St. Nikolaus, visited German and Austrian children at Christmastime.<br /><br />But while St. Nikolaus rewarded the well behaved with small gifts, Krampus, as a more active presence, not only left switches for disobedient children with which their parents could beat them, but spanked, shackled, and even kidnapped the worst juvenile offenders, who were carried away and thrown into hell. Thus, a child's good behavior at Christmastime and indeed throughout the year took on an entirely different folkloric coloring than it did in America, a continent to which Krampus never successfully emigrated, though other parts of Europe had similar \\"dark\\" Christmas traditions.<br /><br />Krampus was a childhood nighttime bogey and bedroom invader par excellence: small, horned, hairy, and black furred, he was almost identical to the archetypal Christian image of the devil. The classic Krampus figure was readily identifiable for his exceptionally long and permanently extended bright red tongue, as well as for having one cloven hoof in addition to a human foot.<br /><br />The numinous Krampus was a hybrid figure composed of both comedic and frightening characteristics; his bestial appearance and unmistakably phallic tongue underscored the decidedly sexual angle in his nature, which several of the included images make apparent. As a liminal trickster of the \\"betwixt and between\\" and a daimonic violator of boundaries and boarders of all varieties, several of the cards appropriately portray the irrepressible Krampus as bursting free from the two dimensional wall of the card and into the laps and<br /><br />The visionary illustrations of the Krampus Postcards are as powerful and strange as the beliefs and folklore upon which they were based. As Krampus is uniformly presented in jesting guise, the overall effect suggests that the children of the late 19th century and early 20th were no more seriously frightened by Krampus than American children of a slightly later era were by the witches and ghosts of Halloween decor and the corresponding folklore. That said, most of the artists clearly considered the Krampus image as a point of departure, and freely added a variety of subtle sociological twists that considerably widened the scope of basic theme.<br /><br />Several cards portray Krampus as a welcomed gentleman seducer, appearing on women's doorsteps dressed in period eveningwear, while others depict him spying enthusiastically on presumably wayward lovers. Two images reveal Krampus as a puppeteer of men, causing mankind's sin as well as punishing it.  Like the Fool in the classic Tarot deck, Krampus gleefully steps off the edge of the earth, a group of shackled children following closely behind him; like the Pied Piper, Krampus leads away a line of children so long that its end disappears into the image's distant horizon.<br /><br />Apparently never shy about causing physical pain and discomfort, Krampus freely pulls children's hair, boxes their ears, and switches their bottoms. Though some children allow themselves to be led blandly away, others are clearly terrorized and beg last minute forgiveness; but regardless of their reaction to him, Krampus' expression of dutiful pleasure never changes.<br /><br />He is also capable of diverse forms of mobility: when not leading children away on foot or painfully pulling them after him, Krampus is driving an automobile, arriving by train, riding a sled, or flying in primitive airplanes, suggesting that there are few places to which he doesn't have access. As a kind of reverse Santa Claus, Krampus carries a basket on his shoulders, typically filled not with dolls and other toys, but with captured human children whose stunned appearance suggests that they have become little more than objects. Several cards depict Krampus carrying off young offenders through the snow, revealing that he is as comfortable in freezing weather as he is in the fires of hell.<br /><br />In one, a smiling snowman and an anthropomorphic half moon in a nighttime stocking cap look peacefully on as Krampus passes by with a child prisoner in the still of the night, suggesting that everything is as it should be.<br /><br />There are also female Krampus figures, and mother, father, and son Krampus families. Fans of Czech filmmaker Jan Svankmajer's 'Faust' (1994) will recognize the Krampus on page 80 as the model for one of that film's enormous devil puppets.<br /><br />Most of the illustrations are traditional in character, and thus any sexual content is far from overt. However the fleshy and lascivious Krampus on page 50 clearly suggests the influence of Aubrey Beardsley, while the stylized Krampus of page 21 resembles nothing so much as a huge turgid phallus carried about on enormous cloven hooves.<br /><br />Page 89's Krampus is nine tenths a rooster, or 'cock.' While Krampus is fond of carrying off huge baskets of adult women, including those of grandmotherly age, he is equally fond of strictly male audiences.<br /><br />It has taken Krampus a hundred years to reach American shores, an event 'The Devil In Design: The Krampus Postcards' celebrates admirably. While some readers might prefer more historical information, Beauchamp's brief explanatory text provides the basic context needed to grasp the images: the illustrations, which speak volumes for themselves, do the rest.<br /><br />Those interested in the evolution of Christmas folklore and other Krampus-like figures may also want to seek out Tony van Renterghem's 'When Santa Was a Shaman' (1995) and Phyllis Siefker's 'Santa Claus, Last of the Wild Man' (1997) for further information.ff young offenders through the snow, revealing that he is as comfortable in freezing weather as he is in the fires of hell.<br /><br />In one, a smiling snowman and an anthropomorphic half moon in a nighttime stocking cap look peacefully on as Krampus passes by with a child prisoner in the still of the night, suggesting that everything is as it should be.<br /><br />There are also female Krampus figures, and mother, father, and son Krampus families.

US	35944741	R2FDCU8S375FQ0	0374529787	40518083	My Sister's Hand in Mine: The Collected Works of Jane Bowles (FSG Classics)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Night, Let Me Be Numbered Among Thy Sons And Daughters	'My Sister's Hand In Mine: The Collected Works Of Jane Bowles' (1970) offers readers the rewarding opportunity of entering the strange but oddly homey world of its author. The volume contains Bowles' only novel, 'Two Serious Ladies,' her single work for the theater, 'In the Summer House,' and thirteen short stories and unfinished pieces. The book's real strengths are 'Two Serious Ladies' and the long story 'Camp Cataract,' works that compliment one another and successfully define the unique landscape of Bowles' vision.<br /><br />Married to the more famous novelist, composer, and expatriate Paul Bowles, Jane was a bisexual woman with strong lesbian leanings. Though her liveliness and wit were widely celebrated by other artists of the period, most of whom were also ardent admirers of her talent, Bowles' life was compromised by severe anxiety, and her final years were marked by illness and tragedy.<br /><br />The individualistic Bowles was probably an introvert in Jung's original definition of term, as her character's fears largely revolve around the idea of \\"passage into the outside world,\\" those stages of life beyond childhood, adolescence, home, and the nuclear family.  But while confronting the outer world is a unpleasant experience for most of Bowles' characters, their family life, far from a paradise, is typically presented as a sentimentally-idealized, but nonetheless claustrophobic, circle in hell. Achieving and maintaining a state of grace was also an important matter for the author, though her unsettlingly tragicomic approach to both themes has historically kept her work from being widely accepted as mainstream American literature.<br /><br />While other idiosyncratic writers, like the vastly more prolific Muriel Spark, have enjoyed decades of popularity and critical and commercial success, and thus the opportunity to carefully evolve their personal vision, Bowles found the act of writing difficult, and her readership during her lifetime, in commercial terms, almost nonexistent.<br /><br />'Two Serious Ladies' concerns Christina Goering and Frieda Copperfield, casual acquaintances who strike out on no-longer-avoidable quests for personal salvation after a chance meeting at a Manhattan party. While Mrs. Copperfield is seeking fulfilling love and sensual pleasure, the independently wealthy Miss Goering seeks spiritual development through material sacrifice, meager living, and confrontation with her fears in their social form.<br /><br />Both women are simultaneously asexual and semiconsciously lesbian in their preferences; the married Mrs. Copperfield enthusiastically waves away her spouse and chases the company of other women in a Central American village, while the sheltered but more confident Miss Goering, who shares her home with both a woman and a man in an ambiguous arrangement, actively pursues a failed businessman and then a gangster in the hope of achieving her goals.<br /><br />Both women are weirdly naive, and Bowles never allows the reader a clear understanding of how knowledgeable, sophisticated, or self-aware either character is. Both encounter and embrace a hilarious assemblage of oddball characters and misfits; like Miss Goering and Mrs. Copperfield, these eccentrics often seem incapable of objective or comparative perception, and may therefore be fated to lives of starchy parochialism. Only Mr. Copperfield, a figure unmistakably based on Paul Bowles, seems stable, clear-headed and rationally self-motivated.<br /><br />Indeterminate social conventions haunt all of Bowles' characters. Routine train rides, visits to relatives' homes, evenings out in taverns and restaurants, business meetings, and even the simple act of making a purchase become comic war zones in which all concerned seem to enjoy a vastly different understanding of what behavior is appropriate and acceptable.<br /><br />The grueling 'Camp Cataract' focuses on a shrewd, secretive, and uncommonly self-aware adult woman, Harriet, who is quietlyand carefully planning a final break with her smothering sister Sadie.<br /><br />Unlike 'Two Serious Ladies,' 'Camp Cataract' contains surreal elements, fugue states, and odd flights of fantasy, but is also more far more specific about the intentions and inner workings of its characters: Harriet's desperate motivations are laid bear in a way that Miss Goering's and Mrs. Copperfield's never are. During her alternately forlorn and energetic pursuit of her sister, Sadie is forced to confront the unpleasant public world she fears as well as the repressed psychosexual underpinnings in her nature. Though wildly funny, few works of fiction can cause readers to wince like 'Camp Cataract.'<br /><br />Throughout her work, Bowles' writing is uniformly simple, admirably crisp, and compellingly readable; she is also a master of peculiar, well-timed dialogue, a talent she uses to great effect throughout.<br /><br />Also notable are 'A Guatemalan Idyll,' an excised section of 'Two Serious Ladies,' and 'A Stick Of Green Candy,' in which a young girl learns that violating the fidelity of her creative imagination precipitates the end of her ability to dream.and carefully planning a final break with her smothering sister Sadie.<br /><br />Unlike 'Two Serious Ladies,' 'Camp Cataract' contains surreal elements, fugue states, and odd flights of fantasy, but is also more far more specific about the intentions and inner workings of its characters: Harriet's desperate motivations are laid bear in a way that Miss Goering's and Mrs. Copperfield's never are.

While the two longest sections (Roger Cardinal's excellent essay, 'The Sense of Time and Place,' and Jane Kallir's commentary on the eighty-seven plates) are sound, other segments underscore the wide cultural divide that continues to exist between the abstraction-tending perspective of some art scholars and the general public's capacity for spontaneous appreciation for various kinds of painting and other cultural products.<br /><br />The paintings of Anna Mary Robertson Moses, which are predominantly landscapes, were initially and earnestly created by an uneducated, unprivileged, and common \\"farm woman\\" of advanced years as gifts for her family, friends, and social peers. When brought to mass public attention in the Forties, the paintings were widely embraced by Americans of all walks of life for their inherent combination of unique talent, nostalgia for family, home, and community, apparent simplicity of method, sentimentality, anecdotal style, and vision of the country's agricultural past. Indeed, most of the paintings suggest a bucolic, Eden-like utopia in which regular and vigorous hard work is nonetheless a necessity for all able-bodied citizens.<br /><br />Though Moses' paintings were initially embraced and promoted by elements within the cultural elite of the Forties, the wider public continued to cherish--and avidly purchase commercial reproductions of--Moses' work long after the art world that had discovered her had lost interest.<br /><br />Whether photographed with President Truman, interviewed in her home by Edward R. Murrow, or appearing on the cover of Life magazine, by the advent of the Fifties, Moses was celebrated as a quintessentially American icon in the tradition of Benjamin Franklin, Johnny Appleseed, Washington Irving, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, or Amelia Earhart.<br /><br />The process of promoting Moses was assisted by several key figures over the decades, but in Moses' case, nothing about her public image was fabricated, and her paintings, like her persona, sold themselves. As a hard-working, elderly widow who advocated traditional American values like industry and self-sufficiency, and whose appearance and mannerisms bespoke of a bygone era, Moses perfectly embodied an idealized representation of the archetypal \\"benign great grandmother,\\" a figure most people, regardless of background, are sensitive to. Only 8 years after her death at 101 in 1961, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp bearing her name and a detail from her painting 'July Fourth.'<br /><br />There is probably no major American artist whose work needs academic interpretation less than Moses', and while critical assessments of her work and life are welcomed, the balance of the essays in 'Grandma Moses In The 21st Century' read like superfluous, self-important, and slightly pretentious padding, especially since the paintings speak perfectly well for themselves in a plain visual language assessable to all.<br /><br />However, John Cardinal's investigative, straight forward, and always-relevant discussion of Moses is a model of what a good art essay should be, and Jane Kallir's plate-by-plate commentary provides the necessary factual information required without straying into unnecessary theory. The eighty-seven color plates are gloriously reproduced and represent all periods of the artist's creative life.<br /><br />Those who would like more information on Moses' life and work may also want to seek out a copy of 'Grandma Moses: My Life's History' (1948), sadly out of print but still widely available via secondhand sources.Appleseed, Washington Irving, Abraham Lincoln, Mark Twain, or Amelia Earhart.<br /><br />The process of promoting Moses was assisted by several key figures over the decades, but in Moses' case, nothing about her public image was fabricated, and her paintings, like her persona, sold themselves.

As an authentic and frequently unprecedented work of literature, '100 Years of Solitude' stands as a robust and healthy challenge to the social, religious, and literary excesses of Protestantism, to which it offers a brilliantly colored, deeply felt, and sensual alternative. With its underpinnings in pagan Catholicism, '100 Years of Solitude' boils over with a psychologically profound, brash, visceral, and distinctly Latin vision of life.<br /><br />Flying freely in the face of Western scientific and philosophical rationalism, the novel offers its readers plagues of forgetfulness, sleeplessness, and clouds of yellow butterflies, ascensions by the living into the heavens, lifelong correspondences with \\"invisible doctors,\\" \\"suspicions of elves,\\" and rain storms and droughts that continue for years on end. One character senses that the Buendias are caught in a tight chronal frame of eternal reoccurrence, while another, perceiving a world without genuine boundaries of any kind, plucks knowledge from a collective unconscious floating in the air while claiming \\"everything is known.\\"<br /><br />Though levitating priests, flying carpet-riding Arabs, fraternal twins who trade destinies, and miraculous inventions abound, the novel never strays very far from its genuine and sincerely felt focus on the vicissitudes of the perpetually vulnerable, desiring, and inherently daydreaming nature of man. Among other things, '100 Years of Solitude' is also a profound meditation on the absurdly barbaric nature of war and the greedy, egotistical, and shortsighted character of the political arena.<br /><br />The Buendia family produces--and keeps producing--two basic kinds of men: idealistic, solitary, single-minded, and creative introverts, represented by the family's patriarch, Jose Arcadio Buendia and his son, Colonel Aureliano Buendia, and the more virile, self-serving, and callous hedonists best represented by sexually potent near-giant Jose Arcadio.<br /><br />Only the perceptive, long-suffering, and ancient family matriarch, Ursula Iguaran, struggles to maintain an objective and ordered understanding of the generally Dionysian chaos that surrounds and eventually envelopes her extended brood. For Ursula, there is little if any relief ever, as the forces of nature and ungainly human passion continuously destroy and deface the fruits of the family's often admirable labors. In the extended, complex, and secretive tangle of Macondo interrelationships, it is Ursula who consciously struggles to prevent incestuous couplings; her continuous prophecy that unbridled lust and misguided emotional liaisons will eventually produce a monster, \\"a child with the tail of a pig,\\" resounds throughout the book.<br /><br />The theme of human solitude is underscored as the one constant and dependable fact of human existence. Every character, by the very nature of their individuality, as well as by the simple hard truths of procreation, is set apart from the others in some distinct but irrevocable manner, whether it be their otherworldly beauty, idiot nature, inherent reflexivity, or a traumatizing episode in their childhoods. Living together in the vast Buendia complex, which is continually collapsing and being rebuilt, the characters often spend months in silence or near silence, even during periods of prosperity and relative happiness.<br /><br />Some characters happily board themselves up in shuttered rooms and become unwashed hermit scholars, while others, quietly planning illusory acts of revenge in response to illusory wrongs, simply don't speak out of spite for the span of theirlifetimes.<br /><br />Some lose their minds as a result of their shattered dreams and obsessive memories of youthful promise. Ghosts of the dead walk the rooms and corridors too, equally isolated in death as in life. One comparatively minor character, Santa Sofia de la Piedad, like Georgina Hogg in Muriel Spark's 'The Comforters' (1957), simply ceases to exist from time to time at the author's whim.<br /><br />Even the more blithe and extroverted characters express themselves predominantly through action rather than words, and for all except Ursula, the stifling burden of unconsciousness is easier to bare than the sustained effort that consciousness requires.<br /><br />Gabriel Garcia Marquez has said that '100 Years of Solitude' came to him in \\"an illumination,\\" a statement that the novel's warm, organic, and fluidly archetypal prose bears out completely.<br /><br />Unlike the later 'Love in the Time of Cholera' (1985), the author's discerning, discriminating, and intruding hand is never sensed. Although frequently funny, brilliantly sustained passages of imaginative and fantastic material (some reminiscent of the Washington Irving of \\"Knickerbocker's History Of New York,\\" \\"Dolph Heyliger,\\" and \\"Wolfert Webber\\") are often followed by short, terse sentences of extreme brutality, such as one concerning a child hacked to death with a machete for spilling a drink on an arrogant soldier's uniform.<br /><br />The novel's conclusion, which unhappily recalls several of Edgar Allen Poe's short stories, may seem inevitable to some readers, while others may find it something of a betrayal of the book's overall tone. Regardless, the glorious miracle that is human existence, and a sense of the inherent, if often hidden, possibilities in all things are sumptuously served up for the reader in passage after passage.<br /><br />Throughout, '100 Years of Solitude' offers a compassionate, beatific vision that, while free of hard-edged moralizing, also never swerves away from the unpleasant truths inherent in human nature and man's finite physical existence. Though the repetitious names of many of the characters can become disheartening (5 major and 17 minor characters, for instance, share the name \\"Aureliano\\"), like Muriel Spark's 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1963), it is a novel that can appreciated and understood by all people, regardless of nationality, social status, educational level, or background.lifetimes.<br /><br />Some lose their minds as a result of their shattered dreams and obsessive memories of youthful promise.

Though the repetitious names of many of the characters can become disheartening (5 major and 17 minor characters, for instance, share the name \\"Aureliano\\"), like Muriel Spark's 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' (1963), it is a novel that can appreciated and understood by all people, regardless of nationality, social status, educational level, or background.	2004-07-06

Indeed, the timeless stories, set in a plantation environment, are directly structured around \\"Miss Sally's\\" \\"little boy\\" and his visits to the cabin of the wise, tender, and loving elderly \\"Negro\\" storyteller, Uncle Remus, who is either a slave, a freed slave, or an indentured servant.<br /><br />The tales, the most famous of which is \\"The Wonderful Tar-Baby Story,\\" share one almost insurmountable problem. Harris chose to exclusively write the stories in what he felt was a good approximation of Southern \\"Negro\\" dialect, and thus, in 'The Favorite Uncle Remus' (1948), readers are confronted with over 300 pages of nearly impenetrable sentences and paragraphs, of which \\"Den w'en it seem like de little Rabs, w'ich dey wuz mighty nigh forty-leb'm um um, is all gone ter sleep, Brer Wolf he crope roun', he did, en feel on de mantel-shelf, en feel, en feel, twel he come ter ole Brer Rabbit money-pus. Ef he want so light wid he han', he'd 'a' knock off de pollygollic vial w'at ole Miss Rabbit put up dar. But nummine! Brer Wolf, he feel, en feel, twel he come ter de money-pus, en he grab dat, he did, en he des flewed 'way fum dar,\\" is typical.<br /><br />As a result, though all of the tales are short and apparently comic, the clumsy, strained, and artificial nature of the dialect quickly grinds each to a frustrating halt.<br /><br />Rather than bringing an element of authenticity to the stories, the dialect not only feels unnecessary and condescending, but also buries and obscures any cleverness, wisdom, and sense of wonder and fun they may contain. Thus the process of absorbing the book becomes one of self-conscious deciphering rather than reading, and the world of Brer Rabbit and his friends remains stubbornly on the page. Very few adults are likely to persevere through more than one tale, and children and teenagers will probably find both 'The Favorite Uncle Remus' and their effort to enjoy it unrewarding and counterproductive.<br /><br />A strict academic reworking of the text into standard English usage would go a long way towards bringing Harris's achievement to a vastly wider audience.dialect not only feels unnecessary and condescending, but also buries and obscures any cleverness, wisdom, and sense of wonder and fun they may contain.

But if \\"the patriarchy\\" erroneously or prejudicially attributed the male gender to the concept of deity, has Starhawk accurately corrected the problem by simply taking the opposite position and replacing the concept of \\"God\\" with that of \\"Goddess\\"?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the question of spontaneous psychological and anthropomorphic projection onto the concept of deity is never addressed, and appears never to have been considered at length by the author. Whether immanent force or transcendent reality or both, the simple truth is that an ultimate deity is unlikely to be gender specific at all.<br /><br />Thus, 'The Spiral Dance,' despite its best intentions, often seems oblivious to its own tone of unhealthy polarity, a tone that suffuses the book in both large and small ways (for example, sentences consistently read \\"women and men\\" instead of the more common \\"men and women\\").<br /><br />Starhawk is quick to point out that her \\"Goddess\\" and women-centered religion are not oppressive to men in any way, regardless of her repeated and somewhat sly suggestions about female superiority, which she doesn't seem to realize are uncomfortably similar to the historical \\"patriarchal\\" position she decries (fellow feminist Camille Paglia has argued that women are the superior sex in a far more convincing, objective, and fact-based manner).<br /><br />The author's religion does recognize a male deity, but, not surprisingly, he is subordinate to and subsumed into the all-encompassing female principal that the \\"Goddess\\" represents. Readers may get the sense that Starhawk, blissfully locked into her own womanhood, simply can't see very far beyond her own gender, and really doesn't want to.<br /><br />Early in the work, Starhawk states that \\"Witchcraft has always been a religion of poetry, not theory.\\" It is also, apparently, not a religion based very much on fact, as Starhawk's \\"religion of poetry,\\" as outlined and historically defined, is based around a loose mishmash of unproven, discredited, or purely erroneous anthropological, archeological, and historical theories (including those of Margaret Murray and Marija Gimbutas).<br /><br />The author refers to the academic scholarship that has eroded much of the witchcraft mythology as \\"blatantly biased and inaccurate,\\" when in fact the opposite is true. It is Starhawk who attempts to support her cause by referring dramatically what she feels are its historical linchpins while she simultaneously denies the untidy complications of history as largely irrelevant.<br /><br />She shrewdly defends her approach by stating, \\"Is Buddhism invalid because we cannot find archeological evidence of Buddha's existence? Are Christ's teachings unimportant if we cannot find his birth certificate or death warrant?\\" Rather bravely, she also asserts, \\"the truth of our experience is valid whether it has roots thousands of years old or thirty minutes old...there is a mythic truth whose proof is shown not through references and footnotes but in the way it engages strong emotions, mobilizes deep life energies, and gives us a sense of history, purpose, and place in the world.\\"  Needless to say, 'The Spiral Dance' falters whenever the book suggests historical precedents, justifications, and traditions for the beliefs it promotes.<br /><br />As with all systems predicated largely upon belief, the question remains: how potentially dangerous and misguided are the beliefs espoused?<br /><br />Are members of witchcraft covens, particularly women, likely to be wiser, saner, and more capable of personal authority and empowerment if they accept Starhawk's interpretation of the period of the European witchcraft persecutions (here referred to as \\"the Burning Times\\")?<br /><br />Starhawk writes that \\"an estimated nine million Witches,\\" were executed, and \\"eighty percent were women, including children and young girls,\\" but admits in her notes for the 10th anniversary edition that \\"actually, estimates range between a low of one hundred thousand and this figure [nine million], which is probably high. The truth, clearly, is that nobody knows exactly how many people died in the persecutions.\\"<br /><br />Undeniably and unavoidably, all organized religions, including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, have actively negative aspects, and have historically. But readers may want to refer to J. S. La Fontaine's 'Speak Of The Devil' (1998) and 'The Abduction Enigma' (1999) by Kevin Randle, Russ Estes, and William P. Cone, for other perspectives on the dangers of irresponsibly indoctrinating potentially naïve, vulnerable, and needy people with myth-based rather than fact-based ideas and theories, particularly those that imply special status, persecution, or hidden but present threats in one's immediate surroundings.<br /><br />'The Spiral Dance' also promotes a heady political activism and what occasionally sounds very much like \\"compulsive compassion\\"; when Starhawk proudly announces that decisions within her coven and others are made by \\"reaching consensus,\\" the shadows of Freud, Adler, and Camille Paglia's \\"Big Udder\\" may spontaneously interject themselves into the minds of more informed and politically savvy readers. In fact, throughout her introductions, Starhawk sporadically adopts both a tone and a voice that sounds suspiciously like a liberal Methodist with radical pretensions.<br /><br />'The Spiral Dance' also has much to commend it, including its promotion of \\"life as a thing of wonder\\" and \\"love of life in all its forms\\" as its basic ethic.<br /><br />\\"The price of freedom,\\" the book rightly says, is \\"discipline and responsibility.\\" Groundless or undue guilt and denial are discouraged (\\"The craft does not foster guilt, the stern, admonishing, self - hating inner voice that cripples action. Instead, it demands responsibility.\\"), and a sense of honor and self-respect are seen as essential, healthy and positive.<br /><br />Sexuality \\"as a direct expression of the life force,\\" is considered \\"numinous and sacred.\\"<br /><br />Strict hierarchies are discouraged or eliminated, and men are encouraged to know and develop themselves as completely and inclusively as possible. Nature is cherished for both its beauty and its bounty.<br /><br />Starhawk would have been better off promoting the included information as inspired by rather than descending from the various matriarchal and witch \\"traditions\\" and mythologies she names.

Stripped of mythology, folksy color, and chest-puffing bravado, Guthrie appears here in all his essential vulnerability and human frailty. Naive potential readers expecting an idealized hero in the mold of Johnny Appleseed may be surprised to discover that Guthrie had his own share of unpleasant personal secrets and dark passages. On the basis of some sexually graphic \\"love letters\\" to a young girl whom he appeared to be stalking, Guthrie was briefly considered as a suspect in the notorious Black Dahlia murder of the late Forties.<br /><br />Oklahoma-born Guthrie was something of a trickster as well as a songwriter, singer, musician, and social activist; sociopathic tendencies swirled just beneath the surface of his psyche throughout his lifetime. Guthrie was both a genuine \\"man of the people\\" who nevertheless affected an exaggerated homespun Okie persona and a fairly well-educated if self-taught individual who liked to pretend he was barely literate.<br /><br />In a textbook case of psychological projection and displacement, Guthrie zealously devoted most of his life to broad socialist causes, passionately believing, for example, that the United States government was parentally responsible to provide for its poor, even while he abandoned his first wife and their three young children for months and years at a time whenever the mood to wander struck him. To their hunger, destitution, and emotional pain, Guthrie, \\"bound for glory\\" in his own mind, was largely indifferent; \\"when that old, long, and lonesome 4-time highball whistles on the breeze, they ain't no tellin' what an old Reckless Rambler like me will do\\" is sadly typical of Guthrie's breezy, self-indulgent commentary about his protracted familial negligence.<br /><br />Regardless of his chronic irresponsibility and ethical failures, Guthrie continually and hypocritically took issue with and targeted those he perceived to be the wealthy, the powerful, and the elite (\\"Just because I ain't got as much money as you got is a pretty good sign that you're crookeder than me\\").<br /><br />Politically, Guthrie's vehement leftist ideology was just as capricious; war was a never-ending wrong to be actively protested against, unless the conditions of the war were those Guthrie found personally agreeable. Thus, in the period before and during World War II, Guthrie rapidly went from loudly protesting the \\"war in Europe\\" to writing songs in support of United States involvement and later proudly served as a merchant marine. From the evidence Cray abundantly provides, it appears that Guthrie was incapable of reasoned, sustained, and complex political thought. Guthrie's \\"do as I say and not as I do\\" behavior, coupled with his \\"look at me, Ma, I'm a radical\\"-style grandstanding are telling indeed.<br /><br />Guthrie inherited the degenerative Huntington's disease from his mother, which, in addition to his alcoholism, makes assessment of his grim later years fairly difficult. By all accounts but his own, however, Guthrie's early life was one of violence and tragedy. While his mother slowly sank into what was then thought to be insanity, his older sister was burned to death during an unfortunate show of temperament, and his once-successful and optimistic father failed in business before being crippled by arthritis and then set ablaze himself by his increasingly deranged and eventually institutionalized wife.<br /><br />Fires of all kinds haunted the extended Guthrie clan, destroying residences and individuals seemingly at random; as late as the Forties, Guthrie's beloved daughter, Cathy, a product of his second marriage, was burned to death after an electrical cord short circuited while the four-year old was left home alone. Later, in the throes of his disease, Guthrie would accidentallyset himself on fire, severely burning his right arm. Regardless of his family's history, Guthrie's third wife reported that she would arrive home from work to find the \\"baby naked and pissed, Woody filthy, all gas jets flaming for heat.\\" Though Guthrie died relatively young, he would live long enough to additionally set fire to the back of a car with a dropped cigarette.<br /><br />Cray's depiction of dustbowl Oklahoma, Depression-era California, Guthrie's wanderings and rise into the national consciousness via radio, and his portraits of Guthrie friends and associates John Steinbeck, Leadbelly, Alan Lomax, Pete Seeger, Burl Ives, Rambling Jack Elliott and Bob Dylan (who some witnesses feel callously imitated the lisps and spasms caused by Guthrie's disease for his own early performances) are detailed, well-rounded, and illuminating.ht arm.

G. Jung.<br /><br />But whereas Jung's many books were underscored by a sense of profound, almost inexpressible knowledge and inner confidence in his material and ability, Neumann's less convincing 'The Great Mother' often seems specious, arbitrary, and murky in both its details and conclusions.<br /><br />The volume's excellent first chapter, \\"The Structure of the Archetype,\\" offers what is probably the best single definition and description of the archetype available anywhere.<br /><br />Though he recovers his bearings again later, Neumann quickly loses his way in his second chapter, \\"The Archetypal Feminine And The Great Mother,\\" which delineates the levels of the unconscious into the unconvincing and clumsy subdivisions \\"The Archetypal Feminine\\" (which is further subdivided into \\"The Uroboric Great Mother\\" and \\"The Maternal Uroboros\\"), \\"The Terrible Mother,\\" \\"The Great Mother,\\" \\"The Good Mother,\\" \\"The Anima,\\" and the \\"projected\\" conscious categories of \\"the Gorgon,\\" \\"Isis,\\" and \\"Sophia.\\"<br /><br />Since Neumann rightly or wrongly believes at every facet of reality--from the unconscious and conscious processes of mankind to the entire natural world (\\"the universe, the primeval darkness, and the generative night sky\\")--can be and has been defined at base in terms of the larger feminine archetype, his portrayal of nature and human destiny is one in which both the individual man and the collective are but playthings to a force that is ruthlessly impersonal, blindly instinctive, and simultaneously transcendent and immediately present in the every day world.<br /><br />Neumann's \\"feminine\\" archetype exists and has existed everywhere and is found in literally everything: in \\"ponds, streams, and swamps,\\" in \\"mountains, hills, cliffs,\\" in \\"fertile muck,\\" in \\"cave, pillar, and rock,\\" in \\"thrones, stones, stone implements, and fire,\\" in \\"plants, roots, and tubers,\\" in \\"the serpent and the scorpion, the fishes of the river and the sea, the wild beasts of wood and mountain, the goose, duck, and heron, the nocturnal owl and the dove, the cow and the bull, goat, pig, and sheep, the bee,\\" in \\"the fruit and the nut,\\" \\"the grain,\\" \\"the house, door, threshold, and tomb,\\" \\"the couch, the table, the hearth, and the bed,\\" \\"the oven and the mill,\\" \\"the cauldron and the pot,\\" \\"the magical song and poetry,\\" \\"suffering and death, sacrifice and annihilation, renewal, rebirth, and immortality,\\" \\"the fertility of men and animals,\\" and \\"earth and heaven.\\"<br /><br />Neumann believes and attempts to prove that the earliest societies were matriarchies that were later usurped and overthrown by men, but curiously fails to explore why such a process might have been necessary or even required for the establishment of civilization and culture as well as for the evolution and development of consciousness.<br /><br />The role of the corresponding male archetype and its dynamic role in mankind's evolution and destiny is one of the questions that the unnuanced text of 'The Great Mother' pointedly begs but flatly ignores at every turn.<br /><br />In Neumann's perspective, it was women who first developed the \\"preparation and storage of food\\" and the \\"fermentation and manufacture of intoxicants\\" as the gatherer and later preparer of herbs, plants, and fruits, she was the inventor and guardian of the first healing potions, medicines, and poisons.\\"<br /><br />As Neumann's ancient women were both hunters and gatherers, \\"only the killing of large animals\\" fell \\"to the males,\\" who were entirely subordinate and dependent on women to sustain them.<br /><br />Then as now, \\"the male remains inferior to, and at the mercy of, the Feminine that confronts him as a power of destiny.\\"<br /><br />Males, Neumann says, are mere \\"bondsmen\\" of powers that ultimately belong and revert to their true source in women as the rightful vessel of the Feminine, who \\"confers no birth and no life without pain.\\"<br /><br />Apparently unable to determine anything whatsoever on his own, even ancient male warriors were only acting in the service of women and the \\"Great Mother.\\" Trapped in an inferior role to the \\"Archetypal Feminine,\\" from birth to death Neumann's males are puppets and second-class citizens in the heretical Feminine order.<br /><br />As finite human beings rather than archetypal forces, women themselves fair only slightly better.<br /><br />How much of Neumann's thesis is accurate and factual?

The last thing the field as a whole needs is more warmed-over pabulum like Nick Redfern's 'Three Men Seeking Monsters,' a sophomorically written, unoriginal rehash of ideas previously put forth in such Fortean classics as John Keel's 'The Mothman Prophecies,' Patrick Harpur's 'Daimonic Reality' and C. D. B. Bryan's 'Close Encounters of The Fourth Kind,' as Redfern's book approaches its subject like frat-boy sensationalism for the gullible. Anyone with more than a modicum of Fortean curiosity has already covered this material before in more straightforward and trustworthy fashion, and seen the worst of it presented via television on programs like Fox's notorious alien autopsy \\"documentary.\\"<br /><br />Redfern seems unnecessarily intrigued with his personality and that of his comrades (sadly represented cryptozoologists Jon Downes and Richard Freeman, both solid Fortean researchers, as their articles in the current issue of Fortean Times attest), as the author's depiction of their camaraderie comes across like both an unconscious and a self-conscious parody of Rik Mayall and the cast of the BBC's 'The Young Ones.'<br /><br />Readers are rewarded with the details of whatever attention-grabbing costume style ('punk,' 'goth,' women's clothing) each man \\"opts\\" to wear on any given day or what items they \\"elect\\" from pub menus; hilariously, while Downes pontificates grandly on some already well-established theories, readers are told that he is  enjoying \\"blackened toast with raspberry jam.\\"<br /><br />In another instance, Redfern shares that their pub breakfast consists of \\"eggs, bacon, fried bread, sausages, tomatoes, and mushrooms, three pots of tea, and a large glass of freshly squeezed orange juice.\\" Critical facts--such as the names of crucial witnesses--are left out, while a wealth of superfluous details glut Redfern's paragraphs.<br /><br />As portrayed, neurotic fantasy role playing seems to be the order of the day. While the author seems to believe he and his cohorts are edgy, individualistic outsiders, a measured yuppie-like emphasis on consumer goods creeps into paragraph after paragraph.<br /><br />The last thing Redfern and his cohorts come across as is serious, mature, perceptive, objective, discerning, and responsible. Throughout, the prankish middle-school attempts at humor only emphasize the book's amateurishness.<br /><br />Potential readers should also ignore the uncritical log-rolling the book has received from certain interested parties in the Fortean community, and condemn that logrolling as the sad, blatant glad-handing and \\"you mention my name, and I'll mention yours\\" strategy that it is.<br /><br />In the strictly Fortean realm, Redfern fairs no better. He illogically draws what can only be vague comparisons between an anonymous doctor's purported experiences with present-day Neanderthals and the 1942 werewolf film, \\"The Undying Monster,\\" but no mention whatsoever is made of Arthur Machen's fairly well-known stories concerning the survival of primitive, inbred men living in remote underground corners of Britain, stories that match Redfern's ostensible theme--and the doctor's 'experiences'--almost exactly, and may be their ultimate source.<br /><br />Is the British government in league with demonic forces, which it is aggressively sending out against its citizens, as Redfern suggests? That's a major claim, and one requiring far more support than the flimsy material offered here. At every turn, Redfern almost begs to written off as larky and inconsequential.<br /><br />Whether fruitlessly chasing a human-sized, bat-winged \\"gargoyle\\" to its lair in a wood--readers won't for a moment believe any such creature was present--or looking for giant worms, lake monsters, or \\"monkey men,\\" the book reads more like a fanciful and hopeful  pitch for an 'X-Files'-style television series more than it does anything else.<br /><br />The final chapter, in which the author and his team ostensibly achieve their goal, is especially ludicrous.  Since Redfern fails to make even their day-to-day experiences seem believable, the scene in which they confront genuine 'monsters' flies right out the window of credibility. In the interest of continuing to be taken seriously as cryptozoologists, Freeman and Downes should have better sense than to let Redfern make such outlandish, evidence-lacking claims for and about them in print. If these three men have met literal 'monsters,' then their experiences deserve a far better testimony than this.<br /><br />The pretensions of 'Three Men Seeking Monsters' are legion. Could Redfern and company stand up to the kind of hard, common sense scrutiny George P. Hansen held Budd Hopkins up to, and then reported in Hansen's 'The Trickster And The Paranormal'? Undoubtedly not.ike a fanciful and hopeful  pitch for an 'X-Files'-style television series more than it does anything else.<br /><br />The final chapter, in which the author and his team ostensibly achieve their goal, is especially ludicrous.

In the interest of continuing to be taken seriously as cryptozoologists, Freeman and Downes should have better sense than to let Redfern make such outlandish, evidence-lacking claims for and about them in print. If these three men have met literal 'monsters,' then their experiences deserve a far better testimony than this.<br /><br />The pretensions of 'Three Men Seeking Monsters' are legion. Could Redfern and company stand up to the kind of hard, common sense scrutiny George P. Hansen held Budd Hopkins up to, and then reported in Hansen's 'The Trickster And The Paranormal'? Undoubtedly not.	2004-03-25

Hawthorne's cast--introverted, voyeuristic narrator Miles Coverdale, apparent utopist visionary Hollingsworth, wealthy feminist crusader Zenobia, and guileless ingenue Priscilla--are more like glittering but only partially-carved mannequins than substantial characters capable of sustaining a novel.<br /><br />'The Blithedale Romance' has historically been promoted as a novel about an experimental socialist utopia, but as Brenda Wineapple outlined in the excellent 'Hawthorne: A Life' (2003), Hawthorne himself was unsure of what the genuine focus of the book was.<br /><br />Earlier titles considered were \\"Hollingsworth,\\" \\"Hollingsworth: A Romance,\\" \\"Miles Coverdale's Three Friends,\\" \\"Zenobia,\\" and simply \\"Priscilla.\\"<br /><br />For lack of anything better, \\"The Blithedale Romance\\" was chosen; upon publication, the novel was praised by Washington Irving and Herman Melville, but panned by Ralph Waldo Emerson, who thought it \\"unworthy of Hawthorne's talent.\\" Reviews were generally negative, and James T. Fields, Hawthorne's publisher, said, \\"let us hope there will be no more Blithedales.\\"<br /><br />A socialist experiment in creating a utopia--Blithedale--does figure in the background, and acts as the novel's primary setting, but, except for some very occasional blather, the complex concerns of bringing a functional, working utopia into existence are entirely ignored and have nothing to do with the real impetus of the novel.<br /><br />For most of the book, only the primary characters seem to be claustrophobically present at Blithedale.<br /><br />Caught up in an incestuous tangle, the four are enclosed and cut off from the rest of humanity by the potentially shattering world of nature that lies inherent in the farm itself.<br /><br />Nothing emphasizes this more than the existence of Coverdale's own hidden tree-top bower and surrogate womb, where he finds escape and solace from the explosive emotional realities bubbling under the brittle social surface; a late pagan masquerade, straight out of 'The May-Pole Of Merry Mount' solidifies Blithedale as a liminal space where anything might happen, including free love in all its hetero-, homo-, and bisexual aspects.<br /><br />But caught up instead in a sudsy melodrama of vaunted idealism, unconscious egotism, shrewdly-enacted treachery, and unrequited love, the characters shuffle through a hazy, uneven plot that is little more than an undisguised 19th century soap opera.<br /><br />'The Blithedale Romance' is also a shaky indictment of Protestant hypocrisy, as its characters are uncomfortably snared between dueling impulses of wishful altruism and a wolfish desire for the absolute triumph of individual will. As presented, the noble society of man is a fragile sham, a frail plywood structure eternally dissolving at the edges, visibly or otherwise.<br /><br />Neurotic temptress Zenobia, a character primarily based on Hawthorne's friend Margaret Fuller, is the only partially successful character, though her ridiculous, syrupy, and embarrassingly off-center platitudes about struggling womanhood (\\"in the battlefield of life, the downright stroke, that would fall only on a man's steel head-piece, is sure tolight on a woman's heart, over which she wears no breastplate...\\") virtually guarantee her absurdist martyrdom on a wayward altar of feminist suffering.<br /><br />As the story draws to a conclusion, a series of extraordinary and crudely executed coincidences attempt, and fail, to tie the torpid plot into a neat bundle.<br /><br />Hawthorne finally allows semi-warrior, quasi-vampire, and arch hypocrite Zenobia to go the way of masochistic Ophelia, gurgling brook, brisk current, emerald moss, reeds, rushes, and all. Far from shedding light on the socially inferior status of women in American society in the 1850s, Hawthorne presents the subject like a mocking and garish caricature.<br /><br />Since Hawthorne wanly satirizes everything and everyone, including his narrator, himself (as the author of the book, who is not to be confused with the narrator), and his style, and as his attempts at satire and irony are uniformly without edge, the novel sinks, as Ophelia did, like a stone.light on a woman's heart, over which she wears no breastplate...\\") virtually guarantee her absurdist martyrdom on a wayward altar of feminist suffering.<br /><br />As the story draws to a conclusion, a series of extraordinary and crudely executed coincidences attempt, and fail, to tie the torpid plot into a neat bundle.<br /><br />Hawthorne finally allows semi-warrior, quasi-vampire, and arch hypocrite Zenobia to go the way of masochistic Ophelia, gurgling brook, brisk current, emerald moss, reeds, rushes, and all.

Le Guin's 'A Wizard Of Earthsea' (1968) is one of the finest coming-of-age novels written during the 20th Century.<br /><br />Grim and unsparing in its depiction of the harshness of existence, the book is nonetheless incredibly wise and beautiful, and should be read by audiences of all ages and backgrounds.<br /><br />With the exception of Tolkien's magnum opus, some critics have called Le Guin's initial three Earthsea books the greatest fantasy novels ever written; but the simple truth is that Le Guin's trilogy surpasses Tolkien's achievement, since, without damaging the integrity of her fantasy world, Le Guin infuses her work with ample deep truths that are applicable to all individuals, all times, and all cultures.<br /><br />'A Wizard Of Earthsea' is the story of Ged, called Sparrowhawk, a young Healthcliffian loner who unwittingly discovers that he has an innate potential for extraordinary magical power.<br /><br />Leaving Gont, the gray, windswept island of his birth to seek training on Roke, the island of wizards, the rough-hewn, sensitive boy foolishly accepts a dare from an envious senior comrade, and thus brings an irrevocable disaster down upon his head.<br /><br />The balance of 'A Wizard Of Earthsea' concerns Ged's comfortless flight from the horror he has raised, as his careless action is one so terrible that its resolution is beyond the power of the even the greatest of Roke's wizards.<br /><br />Earthsea's far-dwelling dragons, of unsurpassable age, erudition, and power, can likewise do nothing to buttress or assist him.<br /><br />Physically and psychically scarred and exiled from mankind by the singularity of his predicament, Ged courageously and responsibly accepts his fate.<br /><br />Accompanied only by a small shrew-like animal that nests in his hood, Ged takes to Earthsea's endless oceans and becomes both the hunted and the hunter of the black, faceless, and unknowable parasite he has unleashed.<br /><br />The fantasy also astutely reflects the psychological truth that archetypal \\"monsters\\" are often, if not always, disenfranchised, wounded, and needy remnants of the very individuals and societies they ostensibly assault and violate.<br /><br />Ged is clearly a Christ figure (Ged/God) and an everyman, and it is to Le Guin's great credit that she conveys both the existential nature of his character and his inexorable destiny in a manner in which the reader can readily identify. Few novels of any genre communicate what it is to be young, ignorant of self-knowledge, misunderstood, emotionally isolated, guilty, and bearing up resourcefully under a terrible burden as powerfully as 'A Wizard Of Earthsea.'<br /><br />As presented, Le Guin's fantasy world is a starkly romantic, autumnal, pre-industrial land of innumerable small islands set in an endless gray sea.<br /><br />The author's sparse, plain-spoken, and nuanced prose combines the stern, unyielding strength of Hilda Doolittle's early Imagist poetry with the psychological profundity of Jung's 'Memories, Dreams, Reflections' (1961) or 'Collected Letters' (1973).<br /><br />Never less than insightful, 'A Wizard Of Earthsea' is a sad, dynamic novel imbued with the genuine power to educate and inspire its audience about the fundamental difficulties inherent in living.eflects the psychological truth that archetypal \\"monsters\\" are often, if not always, disenfranchised, wounded, and needy remnants of the very individuals and societies they ostensibly assault and violate.<br /><br />Ged is clearly a Christ figure (Ged/God) and an everyman, and it is to Le Guin's great credit that she conveys both the existential nature of his character and his inexorable destiny in a manner in which the reader can readily identify.

As such, it is entirely ineffective, and pales in comparison to genuinely gripping nihilistic works like Lautreamont's 'Maldoror' (published only four years later in 1868), Louis-Ferdinand Celine's 'Journey To The End of The Night' (1932), or any of Jean Genet's five classic novels (the first, 'Our Lady of the Flowers,' was published in 1943).<br /><br />Today's readers may recognize that 'Notes From Underground' might have more accurately been titled Victimology 101, since its anti-hero protagonist, who has willingly dropped out of society at the age of forty, seems to exist in a psychic state of what Carl Jung called \\"prehistoric kindergarten.\\"<br /><br />The narrator builds a series of small, circular, and repetitive arguments over the novel's 29 initial pages, then gleefully deconstructs one after the other while simultaneously mocking the reader for ostensibly following the narrator's previous lines of anti-reason. Dostoevsky may have been attempting to make a larger point about a particular kind of aggrieved personality, but if so, the author, in conjunction with his narrator, fails entirely to say anything illuminating. Is 'Notes From Underground' a satire, as some claim? Not officially, it isn't.<br /><br />That Dostoevsky's \\"underground man\\" (\\"I'm no longer the hero I wanted to pass for earlier, but simply a nasty little man, a rogue\\") is bitter goes without saying; he is also cowardly, immature, self-destructive, unobjective, bullying, psychologically inflated, and almost wholly defined by his petty envy and \\"everlasting spite\\" for the rest of mankind.<br /><br />The speaker continually states that he is \\"clever\\" and \\"cleverer\\" than everyone else, yet he repeatedly encourages whatever readership he has to laugh at him, since he assumes such a reaction will be automatic.<br /><br />But there is nothing particularly clever, acute, abrasive, or piercing about his diatribes, and his tepid experiences, as outlined in Part II, \\"Apropos Of Wet Snow,\\" fail to justify his philosophical platform or the outcast position he has elected for himself.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, what sinks 'Notes From Underground' is that its perceptions, debates, and critiques are collectively lacking teeth of any kind.<br /><br />Is it accurate to summarize \\"civilization\\" as an engine that \\"merely promotes a wider range of sensations in man...and absolutely nothing else\\"?<br /><br />There's a world of Marxists that would disagree, and have.<br /><br />Are \\"all spontaneous men and men of action\\" active, successfully or otherwise, \\"precisely because they're so stupid and limited\\"? Do such men routinely \\"mistake immediate and secondary causes for primary ones\\"? Are brave men and intelligent men mutually exclusive groups?<br /><br />It is a verifiable fact that \\"an intelligent man cannot seriously become anything\\" and that \\"only a fool can become something\\"? Western history, with its enormous catalog of highly accomplished \\"dead white males,\\" clearly suggests otherwise.<br /><br />Do \\"normal and fundamental laws\\" inevitably leave mankind \\"unable to do anything at all\\"? Is personal integrity merely a hollow charade trotted out for the benefit of others in all cases?<br /><br />Blanket assumptions like these may leave readers believing that the narrator more than deserves his self-induced fate, and that any society, regardless of size and structure, would be better off without him.<br /><br />Whether Dostoevsky's own opinions or merely those of the narrator, the overall impression the book leaves is that the \\"underground man\\" has erroneously extrapolated his own parochial experiences into verities which he believes apply universally to all men and societies.<br /><br />Since he is so grossly mistaken, as well as enthusiastically committed to his mistake, it's no small surprise that he is a miserable human being.<br /><br />Unfortunately, generations of lax, narcissistic personalities seeking validation for their own choices have embraced 'Notes From Underground' as a blueprint and sacred text. But authentic defiance necessitates exactly the sort of conviction, fortitude, insight, diligence, and sense of the relative that are squarely beyond the limitations of the book's narrator.<br /><br />Irresponsible, short-sighted, sad-sack squabblers like Dostoevsky's narrator have always existed in all cultures, and probably always will. It's unfortunate that Dostoevsky expended the effort to create and give voice to such a character, but gave him so little of appreciable merit to say.own choices have embraced 'Notes From Underground' as a blueprint and sacred text.

While the original novel is no less believable or prismatic, it is both less powerful and less harrowing than its cinematic adaptation.<br /><br />The expository information that opens the book, all of which is absent from the screenplay, generally doesn't convey anything about narrator Ed Gentry or the others characters that is absolutely necessary or cannot be inferred.<br /><br />What the novel does underscore is how Ed's admiration for he-man and 'man's man' Lewis, which falls just short of hero-worship, plainly consists of elements of homosexual love and physical attraction. Unrecognized and unacknowledged by either man, and probably returned by Lewis in a lesser degree, this aspect of their friendship is one merely element among others that will explode disastrously into consciousness before their ill-fated canoeing trip down a Georgia river with two other friends is completed.<br /><br />In the film, Lewis asks Ed starkly why he continues to go adventuring with him, and director John Boorman shortly allows Lewis a brief but telling once-over of Ed's muscular body as he undresses and his shirt slips off one shoulder in a style reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe and other Fifties love goddesses.<br /><br />The novel, however, makes Ed's innocent and spontaneous physical and emotional longing for Lewis clear in a manner that is believable, sympathetic, and utterly lacking in complicated histrionics or theoretical psychodrama. Indeed, few authors have ever fictionalized the genuine motivators of male homosexuality as accurately and acutely as Dickey does here.<br /><br />'Deliverance' is largely about masculine initiation, and while Lewis the survivalist and body-fanatic is ostensibly a self-initiated man, the novel reveals that Lewis' initiation into the mysteries of life and nature, despite his best efforts and intentions, has been somewhat less than complete.<br /><br />When Lewis fails and the others are injured and otherwise incapacitated, Ed, faced not with the 'gentry' of the mountain wilderness but its opposite, is forced to assume the leadership role, and in the process become, at least temporarily, the shrewd, calculating, and ingenuous hero that will save his own life and the lives of his friends.<br /><br />Less shocking today than it was upon publication thirty-four years ago, 'Deliverance' nonetheless remains an original, brave, and truthful work; its themes, far from being outdated in 2013, are even more relevant today, and in more desperate need of answers, than they were in 1970.tions, has been somewhat less than complete.<br /><br />When Lewis fails and the others are injured and otherwise incapacitated, Ed, faced not with the 'gentry' of the mountain wilderness but its opposite, is forced to assume the leadership role, and in the process become, at least temporarily, the shrewd, calculating, and ingenuous hero that will save his own life and the lives of his friends.<br /><br />Less shocking today than it was upon publication thirty-four years ago, 'Deliverance' nonetheless remains an original, brave, and truthful work; its themes, far from being outdated in 2013, are even more relevant today, and in more desperate need of answers, than they were in 1970.	2004-02-09

Emotionally smothered by and dependent upon his \\"terribly queer\\" mother, the young Frost was equally at the mercy of his alcoholic, brutal, and vindictive father. Both parents died relatively young after lives of dissolution and extreme hardship.<br /><br />The circumstances of Frost's youth set the course for his adult existence: year after year, decade after long decade, the poet replicated his fundamental \\"family romance\\" and thus found himself surrounded by, and indeed, further afflicting, a variety of tragically disturbed people and families.<br /><br />Generational patterns of mental instability and violent \\"accidents\\" were the norm, not the exception, in the lives of the people Frost embraced. Amazingly, the fatalistic and cowardly Frost never became fully conscious of the destructive role he played in the lives of those closest to him. Nor did he learn how to master himself or take healthy control over the calamitous events of his personal life.<br /><br />Tellingly, the poet openly mocked anyone who sought out professional psychological help, which he strenuously avoided receiving himself.<br /><br />No single event illustrates Frost's grandiose immaturity and reckless disregard for the lives and emotional health of his family more blatantly than the episode in which Frost woke his six year old daughter Lesley in the middle of night, escorted her downstairs where his sobbing wife was waiting, and, pointing a gun at himself and then at his spouse, told her, \\"Take your choice. Before morning, one of us will be dead!\\"<br /><br />Perhaps understandably, three decades later, Frost's only son, Carol, 38, committed suicide in front of his own small son under identical circumstances.<br /><br />Frost's children were raised in isolation on various New England farms and schooled at home; they grew up in a constricted environment dominated by their severe, tyrannical father and exhausted, physically stricken, and ineffectual mother.<br /><br />With the exception of Lesley, Meyers fails to communicate the children's side of their stories to the reader. The author's intermittent presentation of Frost as a loving father who spent much of his free time nurturing his children falls flat.<br /><br />Frost survived into his 89th year as a wealthy, respected, and world-renowned poet who lunched with American presidents and honored foreign dignitaries, including Nikita Khrushchev, with his presence.<br /><br />It is more than interesting to note that, like an engine of destruction in the mythological guise of a respectable patriarch, Frost's health grew more robust as he aged and as his wife, Elinor (\\"rather silent, sad and dour\\" even before her marriage to Frost), and family withered, became severely mentally ill (both Carol and daughter Irma suffered some kind of psychosis; in her 45th year, Irma was committed \\"as a hopeless case to a hospital for the insane,\\" as was Frost's sister, Jeanie), or otherwise died young (favorite daughter Marjorie at 29).<br /><br />Only Lesley, who Meyers unaccountably refers to as a \\"harsh and sinewy old harridan\\" in later life, survived him.<br /><br />Meyers provides a detailed account of Frost's friendships with other famous poets, including Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Edward Thomas, William Butler Yeats, Carl Sandburg, and Robert Lowell.<br /><br />His analysis of Frost's work is sound if not always persuasive; his evaluation of the influence of Thomas Hardy's poetry on Frost's feels particularly strained.<br /><br />Meyers' discussion of Frost's classic \\"The Road Not Taken\\" in conjunction with one of the poet's letters includes this incomprehensible sentence: \\"The words \\"lonely cross-roads,\\" \\"converged\\" and neither \\"much traveled\\" in the letter become \\"Two roads diverged\\" and \\"less traveled by\\" at the beginning and end of the poem, and the inevitability of \\"converged\\" turns into the perplexity of \\"diverged.\\"<br /><br />Meyers also makes a blatant error when attributing an Irish peasant's narrative about capturing and living for several weeks with a fairy, which appears in Lady Gregory's 'Visions & Beliefs in the West of Ireland' (1920), to Yeats himself. Yeats accompanied and assisted Lady Gregory in her field work for the book, but the narrative in question was clearly not his own, as any reader Gregory's book, which is still in print, can see (the memorate is attributed to \\"an old man, Kelleher,\\" and his wife).<br /><br />Whether Meyers is repeating a mistake that Frost made concerning the subject, or is making the mistake himself, is impossible to discern from the text, as no source is provided. Considering the extraordinary nature of the claim, Meyers' inaccuracy is difficult to overlook.<br /><br />Meyers also adopts Frost's biased image of competitor Carl Sandburg, who appears throughout the book as manipulative pseudo-bumpkin perpetually strumming his \\"geetar\\" for a gullible public.<br /><br />Frost placed his poetical ambition and personal fame ahead of everything else in his life, a situation for which his family and loved ones paid dearly, and for which Elinor never forgave him.<br /><br />Ultimately, Meyers' biography is a casebook example of how the human suffering of others can be the price paid for respectability as well as for great art.rma was committed \\"as a hopeless case to a hospital for the insane,\\" as was Frost's sister, Jeanie), or otherwise died young (favorite daughter Marjorie at 29).<br /><br />Only Lesley, who Meyers unaccountably refers to as a \\"harsh and sinewy old harridan\\" in later life, survived him.<br /><br />Meyers provides a detailed account of Frost's friendships with other famous poets, including Ezra Pound, T.

US	35944741	R3VMG39V58157D	0375400443	133873828	Hawthorne: A Life	Books	5	27	35	N	N	The Long Night Is Young	Brenda Wineapple's erudite 'Hawthorne: A Life' (2003) may be the finest literary biography since Victoria Glendinning's 'Vita: A Life of Victoria Sackville-West' (1983).<br /><br />Applying a fierce intelligence and a distinctly modern sensibility, Wineapple both succeeds in illuminating Nathaniel Hawthorne's character without distorting it and maintaining a masterly evocation of the period in which he lived: Hawthorne's 19th Century America and Europe seem both mysteriously distant and entirely familiar and matter-of-fact.<br /><br />After his father's early death, the young Nathaniel was raised predominantly by women, and strong women--from mother Rose, sister Elizabeth, wife Sophia, and friends Elizabeth Palmer Peabody and Margaret Fuller--dominated his life.<br /><br />Wineapple gives thoughtful consideration to Hawthorne's love for and strong attachment to other men, and provides a lengthy portrait of his intimate friendship with college mate and eventual United States President Franklin Pierce.<br /><br />Devotees of 19th century American literature will be entranced by the image of uneasy comrades Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Hawthorne enjoying a rare peaceful moment ice skating together on a frozen Concord pond. Wineapple's examination of Hawthorne's early adulthood reveals that his infamous \\"long years of seclusion\\" were considerably less secluded than previously believed; her thorough assessment of Hawthorne's complex racist and misogynist attitudes will probably never be bettered.<br /><br />From early youth, Hawthorne suffered from a fatalistic perception that he was an authentic outsider, destined to remain more keenly aware than others but also permanently separated on some basic level from the rest of mankind.<br /><br />Despite his physical attractiveness, relatively good position in New England society, obvious intelligence, and eventual happy marriage, Hawthorne never lost his crippling sense of inner and outer solitude.<br /><br />The abundant portraits, daguerreotypes, and photos of Hawthorne provide a metaphorical correlative: Hawthorne appears preternaturally beautiful in the paintings, but looks gaunt, obsessed, and half-crazed--like a Fritz Eichenberg woodcut of Roderick Usher (\\"Hawthorne sat gazing into the fireplace, his gray dressing gown twisted about his shrinking torso\\")--in several of the included photographs.<br /><br />The Furies also pursued Hawthorne in other ways: whether living in urban Salem or rural Concord, Massachusetts or Maine, London or Rome, Hawthorne was constantly unhappy with his home and surroundings, resulting in continual uprootings for himself and his family.<br /><br />Hawthorne ran on and on, only to find his fundamental displeasure with existence awaiting him wherever he settled. It's fair to say that almost every aspect of living distressed the sensitive author in some fashion, ruining his enjoyment of life, nature, and other people. \\"I should like to sail on and on forever, and never touch the shore again,\\" he wrote. There was no solace anywhere for Hawthorne, who went out with a whimper rather than a bang, withering physically, mentally, and emotionally a little each day, until he was dead at 60.<br /><br />Correspondingly, Hawthorne's fiction is glutted with symbols of guilt, accusation, and decay, from tarred-and-feathered relatives, black-veiled ministers, disembodied strangling hands, and disfiguring birthmarks to poisoned children, bloody footprints, bedeviled forests, and scarlet letters.<br /><br />As he famously wrote about drowned heroine Zenobia in The Blithedale Romance, \\"Six hours before, how beautiful! At midnight, what a horror!\\" In Hawthorne's imagination, the maid really was dead, not sleeping, and images typically associated with innocence, purity, and hope--sylvan woods, children, grade school teachers--are or become pathologically tainted.<br /><br />Hawthorne dwelt claustrophobically in a fallen world; accordingly, he was no admirerof Emerson's transcendentalist philosophy.<br /><br />Luminaries such as Washington Irving, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allen Poe admired Hawthorne's work, though almost no one appears to have embraced his writing unequivocally.<br /><br />Hawthorne has also had a number of formidable critics, including personal friends Emerson and Margaret Fuller.<br /><br />Wineapple succinctly defines Hawthorne's dolorous, congested, and often two-dimensional style: \\"muted irony, authorial detachment, sardonic nonchalance, and modesty mixed with a dollop of hauteur.\\"<br /><br />Having finished 'The House of The Seven Gables', a friend of Hawthorne's remarked to Emerson that \\"a cough took up ten pages, and sitting down in a chair six more.\\"<br /><br />Hawthorne, forever haunted by his own past and the past of his country, raised a number of important themes in his work, but rarely explored and defined those themes with more than a childlike gloss, despite the sincerest application of his talents. The problems inherent in Hawthorne's creative processes were only exacerbated by his suspicion that fiction writing was a feminine pursuit and a worthless occupation for a man.<br /><br />Hawthorne wrote a number of short stories in which fevered, generally well-intentioned if ethically blind scientists meddle with some aspect of nature in the hope of exerting some control over the processes of life and death.<br /><br />Each tale was an attempt at psychological and spiritual alchemy, but, like his protagonists, Hawthorne failed in his attempts to save himself from the engulfing darkness he felt to be an inevitable and ever encroaching aspect of the human experience.of Emerson's transcendentalist philosophy.<br /><br />Luminaries such as Washington Irving, Herman Melville, and Edgar Allen Poe admired Hawthorne's work, though almost no one appears to have embraced his writing unequivocally.<br /><br />Hawthorne has also had a number of formidable critics, including personal friends Emerson and Margaret Fuller.<br /><br />Wineapple succinctly defines Hawthorne's dolorous, congested, and often two-dimensional style: \\"muted irony, authorial detachment, sardonic nonchalance, and modesty mixed with a dollop of hauteur.\\"<br /><br />Having finished 'The House of The Seven Gables', a friend of Hawthorne's remarked to Emerson that \\"a cough took up ten pages, and sitting down in a chair six more.\\"<br /><br />Hawthorne, forever haunted by his own past and the past of his country, raised a number of important themes in his work, but rarely explored and defined those themes with more than a childlike gloss, despite the sincerest application of his talents.

The book is largely a social history, and while all facets of Warhol's work are covered in detail, the focus is squarely on Warhol himself and the continually changing cast of characters whom the artist took under his wing and looked to for inspiration;<br /><br />'Factory Made' also deftly demonstrates how Warhol evolved from an obscure and personally awkward fashion illustrator to one of that decade's most famous and influential cultural icons. While the ambitious, celebrity-seeking Warhol was an exception, Watson also explores the odd paradox by which perennial anti-establishment outsiders contrarily desire nothing greater than to position themselves firmly at the apex of the commercial cultural establishment they ostensibly abhor.<br /><br />Watson takes an unbiased look at the lives of the nascent poets, dancers, writers, actors, filmmakers, and dreamers--who were also often amphetamine addicts, junkies, male prostitutes, flagrant homosexuals, transvestites, political radicals, or strident individualists--that Warhol brought temporarily to fame.<br /><br />Watson follows Warhol's \\"superstars\\" on their largely tragic course from childhood, self-discovery, and social rejection to brief notoriety, momentary creative fulfillment, and graphic self-destruction.<br /><br />'Factory Made' begs the question of whether Warhol exploited the Factory crowd or merely provided them with the abundant opportunities they openly craved.<br /><br />By the book's end, it is clear that the major Factory figures assisted, consciously and otherwise, in both the creation and solidification of the Factory as an avant-garde social space and in defining Warhol's artistic sensibilities.<br /><br />However, the participants were also personally culpable, to varying degrees, for the reckless mayhem and disregard for human limitation ominously and continually present at the periphery of Factory life.<br /><br />As if declaring hard factional evidence against generalized sunny Rousseauism, the biographies of the Factory's key figures frequently suggest the brutal nihilism of a Jean Genet or Paul Bowles novel: a beautiful young woman loses permanent control over her motor functions due to prolonged drug abuse; the Factory's young photographer locks himself inside an on-premise bathroom for 18 months, speaking to himself in two distinctly different voices, while business as usual carries on around him outside; a talented dancer commits suicide by leaping grandly out a 5-story apartment window as a friend watches; maggots crawl over the rotting corpse of a minor, but historically important, Factory figure.<br /><br />A somewhat vacant personality himself, Warhol carelessly entertained himself with the company of fragile, unstable, and disintegrating young men and women. This continued for years, until the imbalanced Valerie Solanas charged into the Factory and shot Warhol in the stomach, an act which left the artist clinically dead for six minutes and physically and mentally scarred for the balance of his life.<br /><br />For those Factory habitues who survived the 'Warhol Sixties' and their 'Fifteen Minutes of Fame' (a term coined by Warhol), the future was grim.<br /><br />Many remained drug addicted and died penniless at a relatively young age; Eric Emerson's body was found along the side of a road, and Ingrid Superstar, who inexplicably gets little coverage, went out for a pack of cigarettes at the age of 42 and was never seen again.<br /><br />Warhol, by then a multimillionaire, was able to move on and away from the detritus of the Sixties, enjoying prestige and celebrity the world over. However, healthy adaptations to society, sustained careers, or monetary security were rare among his former prodigies and intimates.<br /><br />Collectively, Warhol and his favored cohorts helped to irrevocably turn the tide of American culture, for better or for worse. 'Factory Made' provides some answers to the mystery of how this takeover was achieved, and what the human cost was for those who participated.ican culture, for better or for worse.

Her sentences virtually crackle with energy and verve, humor and acuity.<br /><br />Readers familiar with Paglia's previous work already know her to be a walking testament to Western culture.<br /><br />Here, Paglia brings the same brilliant contextual ability to 'The Birds' that she brought to the work of Spencer, Byron, Swinburne, Wilde, Hawthorne, and Dickinson in 1990's 'Sexual Personae.'<br /><br />Whether discussing Hitchcock's oeuvre or psychology, Tippi Hedren's facial expressions, wardrobe or coiffure, the original Daphne du Maurier short story upon which the film was based, real episodes of bird attacks along the California coast, or the myriad technical processes involved in the making of the film, from sound and cinematography to special effects, Paglia, who seems to know everything, is in top form. If a character so much as crosses their legs, Paglia has something revealing to say about it.<br /><br />Paglia carefully moves through and interprets each scene, expressing surprising and persuasive theories about the smallest of details, demonstrating in the process how absolutely nothing should be overlooked, assumed, or taken for granted in films as carefully planned and executed as Hitchcock's.<br /><br />Moving from episode to episode, Paglia cumulatively offers her own astute interpretation of the film's notoriously ambiguous meaning.<br /><br />Paglia has scrupulously researched her subject, interviewed Tippi Hedren, who she clearly reveres, and obviously enjoyed the writing of 'The Birds' tremendously.<br /><br />Less hilarious than some of her other work, 'The Birds,' film writing at its best and a cut well above most of the other titles in the BFI series, is a sheer pleasure to read.

Fighting paranoia as he discovers that \\"Filipa\\" seems to know his every thought and action and is even able to intervene in his daily affairs, the author sets off to England and Greece to prove to himself that \\"Filipa\\" was in life who she claims to be in death.<br /><br />'The Siren Call Of Hungry Ghosts' is a disturbing book on many levels, not the least of which is Fisher's initial failure to establish any sort of sanity-preserving rational guidelines to help him discriminate between, understand, and classify his perceptions, insights, and experiences.<br /><br />Though Fisher had written two earlier books on the subject of reincarnation, and appears to have humbly considered himself somewhat of an expert and skeptic, readers will readily discern Fisher's amazing lack of objectivity, as well as his broad credulity and emotional desperation as his experiences with \\"Filipa\\" devolve from the surprising and inexplicable to the harrowing and destabilizing.<br /><br />The book is full of indefinite suppositions like \\"throughout recorded history, many people have been sensitive to an accompanying presence in their daily lives\\" and \\"humanity has always been attended by invisible beings,\\" which make it clear that bedrock intellectual ballast was a quality the author lacked.<br /><br />As a result, Fisher seems headed for serious trouble even before the events of the book begin, especially since \\"gullible\\" is an adjective the author feels applies only to other channeling enthusiasts.<br /><br />Sadly, though familiar with the work of William James, Carl Jung, and Julian Jaynes, Fisher never seriously considers the dynamic role human psychology may play in the complex channeling phenomena.<br /><br />Since the author was clearly experiencing a remarkable series of extraordinary events, readers may find it difficult to sympathize with his literalizing desire to hold the \\"discarnate\\" presences absolutely at their word, as if the content and nature of their pronouncements were his to command. As the book progresses, the author's \\"need to believe\\" becomes increasingly frantic, barely concealing an unsubtle will for power that Fisher fails to acknowledge or discipline.<br /><br />Addicted to \\"Filipa\\" and the romantic fantasies he has spun around her, confused, and manipulated on all levels by an increasing variety of \\"entities,\\" Fisher pays a heavy price for his hunger for \\"self-knowledge,\\" preoccupation with the dubious notion of \\"eternal love,\\" and needy willingness to place his emotional and mental welfare wholly in the trust of apparent unknown super-normal agencies.<br /><br />Obviously, Fisher should have questioned whether his fervent desire for an all-powerful and transcendent guardian figure did not disguise his ownunresolved parental complexes.<br /><br />Fisher did realize that his interest had become an unhealthy obsession, but rather later in the game than readers will. By that time, he was moving unsuccessfully from channeler to channeler, attempting to prove that \\"Filipa\\" could manifest identically through different mediums, or that other entities could blindly identify her as his true \\"guide,\\" and thus offer some evidence of her objective reality.<br /><br />In one bizarre episode remarkable for its audacity, Fisher flies to England in hopes of obtaining an audience with a newborn infant who he believes to be the reincarnation of \\"Ernest,\\" one of the disembodied personalities whose given history has proven to be false.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the author's human relationships fail, and he finds that \\"no matter how hard I tried, I could not shrug off a cloying sense of contamination which could neither be pinpointed or explained. Life had rarely been so fraught with uneasiness.\\"<br /><br />The book's last chapter and newly-added epilogue find Fisher wiser, paraphrasing Goethe (\\"Whatever liberates our spirit without giving us self-control is disastrous\\") and Jung (\\"We die to the extent that we fail to discriminate\\"), but still anxious, paranoid about the \\"invisible\\" forces around him, unsure of the order of things, and fearful that the retribution of the \\"spirits,\\" his \\"unseen enemies,\\" may lead to his demise.<br /><br />'The Siren Call of Hungry Ghosts' is an intelligent book that Fisher partially intended as a warning to others; it is also a sad and educational commentary on human fallibility, hubris, recklessness, and the tragedy that can arise when \\"the abiding human need for greater meaning in life\\" goes awry.unresolved parental complexes.<br /><br />Fisher did realize that his interest had become an unhealthy obsession, but rather later in the game than readers will.

Quoted passages--many of admirable simplicity--reveal that Levi-Strauss also appreciated straightforward writing, thinking, and scholarship in others.<br /><br />Nonetheless, much of the book's content is bogged down in miasmic discussions concerning simplistic points of fact or interpretation that are obvious in many cases (\\"the principle underlying a classification can never be postulated in advance\\"; or the unsurprising fact that Indian tribes from opposite regions of North America regarded the crow in entirely different lights), thus further obscuring his already ambiguous theses.<br /><br />Levi-Strauss conjures up extended metaphors which he manipulates haphazardly (the most prominent being the comparison of the myth-making process to the 'bricoleur'), and makes outright, seemingly willful mistakes of logic, such as the passage in which he refers to an eagle hunter cleverly hidden within a self-devised trap as \\"both the hunter and the hunted\\" merely because the man has situated himself on the inside of the trapping mechanism: within the trap he may be, but hunted by the eagle, or by anything else, he is not. That the hunter remains in firm control over the successful capture of the eagle is a fact Levi-Strauss slyly decides to look away from.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Levi-Strauss makes laughably incorrect suppositions when attempting to correct the broad generalizations of others, stating, for instance, after tacitly acknowledging the existence of such dietary cravings, that \\"there is no evidence that pregnant women the world over have cravings.\\"<br /><br />Moving from literal to figurative meaning and jumping from objective fact to subjective interpretation without restraint (\\"Nature is not in itself contradictory. It can become so only in terms of some specific human activity which takes part in it; and the characteristics of the environment take on a different meaning according to the particular historical and technical form assumed in it by this or that type of activity\\"), the author's sentences intertwine recklessly together until the reader can reasonably conclude that entire passages are dazzlingly free of definite, cohesive content of any kind.<br /><br />Though he has literally hundreds of objective facts at his fingertips, Levi-Strauss' confidence in his ability to build them into a sustained, persuasive presentation seems illusory at best.<br /><br />Readers who have thus far found the book almost impossible to absorb will find their judgment richly rewarded when Levi-Strauss discusses the role of domesticated animals in Western civilization--a subject most readers have had some degree of everyday familiarity with--in Chapter Seven, \\"The Individual As A Species.\\"<br /><br />Beginning with the absurd statement that \\"birds are given human christian [sic] names in accordance with the species to which they belong more easily than any other zoological classes, because they can be permitted to resemble men for the very reason that they are so different,\\" and continuing \\"consequently everything objective conspires to make us think of the bird world as a metaphorical human society: is it not after all literally parallel to it on another level?\\", the author's discussion of what he believes constitutes the underlying processes in naming dogs, cows, and horses in the West is so transparently ludicrous that it exposes everything that has come before as the intellectual hokum that it is.<br /><br />The main supporting audience for 'The Savage Mind' has been masochistic American academics who bow reflexively to European theorists, particularly French theorists, as if on command, building author cults small and large in the process, and thus entering suicidally into intellectual perdition.<br /><br />For such academics, the more obtuse a work, the better; most esteemed is a book completely beyond comprehension.<br /><br />'The Savage Mind,' a work of anti-knowledge, warrants that level of criticism: it completely fails to succinctly outline its ideas, or prove, finally, that its incommunicable 'theories' have any appreciable merit whatsoever.lly into intellectual perdition.<br /><br />For such academics, the more obtuse a work, the better; most esteemed is a book completely beyond comprehension.<br /><br />'The Savage Mind,' a work of anti-knowledge, warrants that level of criticism: it completely fails to succinctly outline its ideas, or prove, finally, that its incommunicable 'theories' have any appreciable merit whatsoever.	2003-10-20

Moses' new volume, 'Mother Goose,' a sublime blending of New England and fairy tale motifs, is his finest work since leaving Washington Irving's haunted Hudson River Valley behind.<br /><br />Here, Moses has created glorious landscapes that are equal parts 18th Century bucolic America and timeless dream country: Jack and Jill, the Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe, Little Bo Peep, Humpty Dumpty, Peter Pumpkin Eater, Old Mother Hubbard, Wee Willie Winkie, and Little Miss Muffet dwell amongst and mingle with productive farmers on their way to market, well-groomed grocers standing proudly outside their pristine establishments, cows and sheep grazing peacefully in verdant pastures, whales frolicking in the distant sea, carefree boys rolling hoops through winding lanes, and loving families gathered together to watch the stars appear in the night sky. Rising over distant mountains, a curious moon eyes the scenery shyly; a smiling witch astride a broomstick sweeps the cobwebs back from the heavens; and the Queen of Hearts, slightly outraged, chases after her tray of stolen tarts. The four seasons, and the American Flag, figure prominently.<br /><br />The characters from each of these 70 nursery rhymes and riddles are portrayed in 12 glorious, brightly-colored, and highly-detailed splash pages, each reminiscent of the work of Moses' famous great-grandmother, Anna Mary Robertson, \\"better know as Grandma Moses,\\" as the liner notes state. The rhymes and riddles are presented on alternating pages, allowing Moses' paintings to shine unencumbered by text.<br /><br />Like Moses' earlier books, 'Mother Goose' is a visionary work that subtly underscores the pleasures of honest toil, the odd mysteries of life, the miracle of differentiation in human character and behavior, and God's presence in the immediate and the every day.miracle of differentiation in human character and behavior, and God's presence in the immediate and the every day.	2003-10-13

Also known on the Hollywood and Los Angeles streets as the \\"Black Dahlia,\\" in death Short has become a numinous cult figure, with a variety of groups, including feminists, vying to defend, correct, champion, and solidify Short's character for present and future generations.<br /><br />Though some newspapers characterized Short as a streetwalker at the time of her murder, today Short has been largely reinvented as a strictly tender-hearted young woman who became the wholly innocent victim of a demented sexual predator.<br /><br />Gilmore's book, like Mary Pacios' 'Childhood Shadows' (1999) and Steve Hodel's 'Black Dahlia Avenger' (2003), is partially an earnest attempt to discover who Elizabeth Short was in fact.<br /><br />No one should be dismayed to learn that Short was an average human being in almost every way, vulnerable, fallible, and, by turns, considerate and selfish, thoughtful and aggressive.<br /><br />The abundant evidence establishes that Short was neither a prostitute nor a promiscuous young woman.<br /><br />The product of a good, but broken, New England home, Short was a pretty teenager who dreamt of a career in Hollywood films. At 16, she began spending the winter months in Miami to ease her severe asthma.<br /><br />Away from her immediate family, well mannered and vivacious, Short dated freely, was fond of enlisted men, and actively sought a respectable fiance.<br /><br />At some point in early adulthood, Short apparently discovered that her reproductive organs were so undeveloped that she was incapable of engaging in normal human intercourse. What affect this traumatic discovery had on Elizabeth's life and psyche is one of the key questions of the case. As 'Severed' theorizes, at least one apparently loving young man unhappily broke off their engagement because of this abnormality.<br /><br />Making her way to Southern California, where she simplistically hoped to achieve stardom, Short began a vagabond existence of struggle, hunger, irregular employment, and constant changes of address.<br /><br />In well over her head, Short developed a habit of striking up acquaintanceships with anyone she thought might be able to help her attain her goals. Reduced to freeloading, Short often lived parasitically off friends and strangers.<br /><br />Short's involvements with men remained inevitably problematic; she seemed to have slowly surrendered hope of ever achieving a happy marriage.<br /><br />Unaware of her inability to engage in intercourse, some men thought her a supercilious tease.<br /><br />Over time, Short began identifying with the self-loathing alcoholics, social outcasts, marginal figures, and hoodlums who increasingly became her companions.<br /><br />Always a risk taker, Short's behavior during this period suggests an absence of common sense, the presence of mental imbalance, and a weak survival instinct: she continually jeopardized her own security, made reckless decisions, and took enormous risks with her physical safety.<br /><br />She was involved in at least one physically abusive relationship, and often appeared to be terrorized and on the run from one or more persons.<br /><br />Importantly, though she could have returned permanently to the security of her mother's Massachusetts home at any time, she did not. Though she had become a skillful emotional manipulator and used others freely for personal gain, Short paradoxically continued to retain her naivet&eacute;, acute sentimentality, and fantasies of success and romantic fulfillment.<br /><br />In the age of Lana Turner, Betty Grable, Anne Sheridan, and Lizbeth Scott, Short misguidedly created the noirish persona that came to be known on the streets as the \\"Black Dahlia\\": she wore thick layers of \\"geisha-white\\" facial makeup, \\"blood-red\\" lipstick, dark clothing, and her trademarkdyed, jet-black hair stacked high.<br /><br />People, especially men, did take notice, but they were not the talent scouts and film agents Short hoped to attract.<br /><br />Psychologically, the Black Dahlia persona can be interpreted as a neurotically-motivated defense mechanism spontaneously generated to compensate Short, via inflation, for the fundamental problem of her apparent genital handicap.<br /><br />A tragic, isolated, and increasingly deluded figure obsessed with \\"making contacts,\\" at the time of her death at only 23, Short's teeth were so decayed (as friends, as well as the coroner's report, noted) that she used white candle wax to fill in the cavities before going outdoors.<br /><br />Despite such hard and telling facts, and though she had no formal training or apparent talent, Short believed a career as a film star remained an inevitability for her.<br /><br />As Gilmore's text carefully illustrates, Short's psychological and ethical decline did play a role in her death. Short was an assertive personality who did as she pleased, continually placed herself in dangerous circumstances, and was neither helpless nor innocent.<br /><br />Thus the problem for some feminists, who want to believe that Short had every right to act irresponsibly without coming to harm.<br /><br />Those feminists defending Short also fail to grasp that human character is an area where \\"paradox, contradiction, and ambiguity abound.\\" At the time of her death, Short was likely a liminal figure, a shrewdly calculating opportunist who nonetheless perceived herself as an ambitious young lady of good intention.<br /><br />Those who knew Short as a sweet child and likable young lady in Medford, Massachusetts ignore the fact that people can and sometimes do change for the worse, especially under adverse circumstances. Since Short's murder has never been officially solved, it is Short's fascinating psychology, in conjunction with the grisly nature of her death, which remains the focus of the case for almost all interested parties.<br /><br />Gilmore's generally excellent book offers an interpretation of the broad facts and names a suspect. Here, the killer is believed to be an individual the author himself pursued for two long decades.<br /><br />'Severed' is cautious, non-exploitive, fair, and realistically sympathetic to Short throughout.<br /><br />At no time does Gilmore suggest that Short, in any manner, deserved her fate.<br /><br />The absence of footnotes, sources, and an index may lead some to question the book's credibility.<br /><br />Potential readers unfamiliar with the very graphic morgue photos of Short's mutilated corpse, which are included, may want to approach 'Severed' cautiously.jet-black hair stacked high.<br /><br />People, especially men, did take notice, but they were not the talent scouts and film agents Short hoped to attract.<br /><br />Psychologically, the Black Dahlia persona can be interpreted as a neurotically-motivated defense mechanism spontaneously generated to compensate Short, via inflation, for the fundamental problem of her apparent genital handicap.<br /><br />A tragic, isolated, and increasingly deluded figure obsessed with \\"making contacts,\\" at the time of her death at only 23, Short's teeth were so decayed (as friends, as well as the coroner's report, noted) that she used white candle wax to fill in the cavities before going outdoors.<br /><br />Despite such hard and telling facts, and though she had no formal training or apparent talent, Short believed a career as a film star remained an inevitability for her.<br /><br />As Gilmore's text carefully illustrates, Short's psychological and ethical decline did play a role in her death.

Here, the killer is believed to be an individual the author himself pursued for two long decades.<br /><br />'Severed' is cautious, non-exploitive, fair, and realistically sympathetic to Short throughout.<br /><br />At no time does Gilmore suggest that Short, in any manner, deserved her fate.<br /><br />The absence of footnotes, sources, and an index may lead some to question the book's credibility.<br /><br />Potential readers unfamiliar with the very graphic morgue photos of Short's mutilated corpse, which are included, may want to approach 'Severed' cautiously.	2003-09-02

Allen Hynek, Philip J. Imbrogno, and Bob Pratt is a sensible, sober book on the subject of unexplained aerial phenomena.<br /><br />Witnesses to the events and active participants in the investigation during the period described, the authors have limited the book to examining the dramatic 13-year UFO wave that took place over the Hudson River Valley from 1982 through 1995. During that period, the UFOs were seen by an estimated 7,000 people and reported to authorities by at least a tenth of that number.<br /><br />The \\"boomerang-shaped,\\" brightly-lit UFOs behaved like brazen tricksters and interactive provocateurs during their reign of the night skies.<br /><br />Most often described as \\"bigger than a football field,\\" the silent objects flew less that 500 feet above heavily populated commercial and residential areas, stopped traffic on freeways, turned sideways and spiraled through the air like Ferris wheels, dived into and flew out of bodies of water, hovered over single homes and cars for minutes on end, responded to lights flashed in their direction with dramatic light displays of their own, and disappeared over the horizon in bursts of unbelievable acceleration.<br /><br />Several witnesses reported that the objects dematerialized--or \\"vanished\\"--right before their eyes.<br /><br />On the night of July 24th 1990, an enormous, apparently nonchalant UFO hovered over the Indian Point Nuclear Reactor Complex and came within thirty feet of the only reactor in operation.<br /><br />Awestruck plant personnel had the object on camera for more than fifteen minutes, and were given tentative orders to shoot it down.<br /><br />Helpless police officers confronted the UFOs and repeatedly explained to panicked callers that they did not know what the objects were. The FAA reported that witnesses were seeing nothing more than small lightweight planes flying together in formation, an explanation few accepted. The national media ignored the sightings year after year.<br /><br />However, identically-described objects were reported in the area as early as the mid-Fifties, and have been reported in subsequent decades from countries all over the world.<br /><br />Commonly known today as \\"black triangles,\\" a number of theorists--experts and amateurs alike--believe the triangles are the product of United States \\"black operations\\" military programs. The most common theory is that the objects are enormous \\"solid dirigibles,\\" or \\"stealth blimps,\\" that function as transportation systems for large numbers of soldiers and masses of heavy equipment.<br /><br />Were the Hudson Valley UFOs secret advanced-model solid dirigibles? If so, why did they repeatedly fly over areas where they would inevitably be seen by a great number of affluent, educated people?<br /><br />What practical purpose could their colorful, complex light patterns have had? If the objects were created to carry government troops, why has no soldier come forward to discuss his or her experience on such a vessel?<br /><br />If the United States has access to such incredibly advanced technology, why weren't these ships utilized in recent wars? Why are the United State's space shuttles still built with comparatively rudimentary and unreliable technology?<br /><br />Though the presented evidence often seems highly credible, it is difficult to accept that the United States government, as it is generally understood to exist, can presently create and control objects like those reported here.<br /><br />Nor is there any sound reason to believe that the Hudson Valley UFOs were extraterrestrial craft.<br /><br />Interpreted imaginatively, the objects seem like nothing so much as highly advanced, unmanned investigatory probes or other scientific tools--immense to us but tiny, perhaps even microscopic, to their creators--from some greater plane of reality that were intermittently thrust into mankind's perception, andthen removed from it with equal ease.<br /><br />Like objective correlatives to the allegory of Plato's Cave, the objects seemed like tangible, mocking proof that the universe is a much stranger place than mankind, with its dogmatic \\"consensus reality,\\" wants to accept. This is true regardless of the genuine facts concerning their nature and origin.<br /><br />The authors remain admirably restrained and objective throughout, hesitantly putting forth ideas but drawing no conclusions (except for one unfortunate slip in Chapter 16 when the UFOs are described as \\"something [that is] not of this Earth\\"). A number of witnesses of the phenomena--including police officers--are quoted at length. Reports of alien abduction phenomena, what some witnesses called \\"telepathic communication\\" with the object, and CE-IIIs ('close encounters of the third kind') are noted but left purposefully undiscussed.<br /><br />As Jung concluded in his \\"Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies,\\" \\"Something is seen, but what?\\"then removed from it with equal ease.<br /><br />Like objective correlatives to the allegory of Plato's Cave, the objects seemed like tangible, mocking proof that the universe is a much stranger place than mankind, with its dogmatic \\"consensus reality,\\" wants to accept.

But according to Cheyette, Spark nonetheless failed to completely regain the faithful religious perspective of her initial novels.<br /><br />Cheyette makes a number of conspicuous mistakes throughout, including the simplistic error of writing as if early Spark protagonists Caroline Rose and January Marlowe (who Cheyette calls \\"hopelessly fissured\\") and their author are identical.<br /><br />With the exception of 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' no Spark novel is given a fully adequate examination, and Cheyette, caught up in Spark theory and esoterica, almost completely neglects the blatant, very intelligent humor that fuels her writing.<br /><br />All of Spark's novels have a sharp and cutting edge, even those that are among her most playful; all of her fiction betrays a partially antisocial and actively critical frame of mind (which is famously reflected in the words of one protagonist: \\"I enjoy a puritanical and moralistic nature; it is my happy element to judge between right and wrong, regardless of what I might actually do. At the same time, the wreaking of vengeance and imposing of justice on others and myself are not in my line. It is enough for me to discriminate mentally and leave the rest to God.\\")<br /><br />Few Spark scholars will agree with Cheyette that 'Memento Mori' (1959) is a \\"disturbing novel\\" that reflects an \\"all-pervading madness.\\"<br /><br />In her famous address to the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, 'The Desegregation of Art' (1971), Spark stated, \\"And everyone knows we have to give up what is bad--it is a banal moral precept.\\" However, Cheyette misquotes and misinterprets his subject completely, writing that Spark \\"[now] rejects the study the study of evil as a 'banal moral precept.'\\"<br /><br />Though ham-fisted antagonist Georgina Hogg does indeed literally vanish whenever not a part of the direct action in 'The Comforters,' Cheyette incorrectly claims that all \\"figures such as Mrs. Georgina Hogg simply disappear when they are deemed only to inhabit the physical world.\\"<br /><br />A brilliant writer renowned for the genius of her inventiveness, Spark never used a plot device more than once.<br /><br />Cheyette theorizes that Spark's middle period was precipitated by her discovery that her early faith was \\"simple-minded.\\" Isn't it more likely that Spark, who was and remains in many ways a traditionalist, was simply disillusioned with the radical changes in Western society and culture in the Sixties and Seventies, as the highly prescient 'The Takeover' (1976) explicitly makes clear?<br /><br />Cheyette ignores the fact that all of Spark's novels, with the exception of 'The Driver's Seat,' to some degree reflect the higher, non-temporal spiritual truths that overlay a fallen world.<br/><br />1971's savage, sardonic 'Not To Disturb' ends with the sentence \\"outside the house, the sunlight is laughing on the walls,\\" which is a subtle way of expressing the eternal presence of God in a world where godlessness is only apparent.<br /><br />As late as the naturalistic 'A Far Cry From Kensington' (1988), Cheyette finds Nancy Hawkins a \\"troubling heroine\\" instead of the complex, realistically drawn, and resolve-filled protagonist she is. Is that book's glamorous Emma Loy \\"an idealized version of [Spark] herself,\\" as Cheyette flatly declares?<br /><br />Cheyette also misses the humorous, retrospective-flavored in-jokes Spark knitted into the plot of 'Symposium' (1990), which included a Brodie-like schoolmarm, a band of wayward nuns, a sinister butler, a figurative rather than literal \\"madman in the attic,\\" the use of Scottish Border Ballads, and the active presence of the supernatural.<br /><br />Fans and scholars of Muriel Spark's work--the single audience for a book such as this--are likely to object to at least one statement or conclusion on each page of this earnest but misguided study.<br /><br />Does the distinctive 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie' actually most resemble the watery 'Ballad of Peckham Rye' (1960) when considering Spark's oeuvre as a whole?<br /><br />Are Spark's spiritually struggling protagonists merely humanly flawed and vulnerable, or are they \\"[so] split off from themselves, they inevitably have secrets to hide and prey to blackmailers\\"?<br /><br />In 'The Comforters' and 'Robinson' (1958), does Spark \\"descend into the world of unrestrained emotions and unconverted [personal] history\\"?<br /><br />Did Spark suffer an \\"illusion of God-like narrative control\\" when writing the early novels?<br /><br />Can 'The Bachelors' (1960) accurately be called \\"homophobic\\" merely because it features one hilarious homosexual character among its cast of unbridled eccentrics?<br /><br />Can Sandy Stranger be \\"immediately limited and predetermined by her surname,\\" or is Cheyette reading Spark with far too much literalism in the greater interest of framing his argument?<br /><br />An enigmatic, effervescent, and confident writer (\\"I was always too grand,\\" the newly-famous Spark once declared to acquaintances who asked if she was \\"too grand now\\" to spend time with them) of nuanced metaphysical fiction, at 85 (and about to publish her 22nd novel, 'The Finishing School'), Muriel Spark and her work deserve a more closely observed and cautious appraisal than she receives here./><br />1971's savage, sardonic 'Not To Disturb' ends with the sentence \\"outside the house, the sunlight is laughing on the walls,\\" which is a subtle way of expressing the eternal presence of God in a world where godlessness is only apparent.<br /><br />As late as the naturalistic 'A Far Cry From Kensington' (1988), Cheyette finds Nancy Hawkins a \\"troubling heroine\\" instead of the complex, realistically drawn, and resolve-filled protagonist she is.

Anyone arguing for the permanent application of universal human rights as social policy is bound to see vociferous dragons, red in tooth and claw, looming from hazy corners of the world map, whether they're genuinely there or not.<br /><br />While a vision of \\"universal human rights\\" is obviously a noble one, Said never seems to have asked himself how such \\"universal human rights\\" would or could be implemented or enforced. Wouldn't the attempted \\"permanent application of universal human rights\\" eventually lead to a Big Brother state, to government control and fascism, to stringent control over the behavior of \\"free\\" men and women, and to enforced uniformity?<br /><br />The major problem with 'Representations Of The Intellectual' is not Said's objective goals, but the childish, often depthless manner in which he rationalizes them and hopes to bring them to fruition.<br /><br />What caliber of argument is it to suggest that desiring a place at the victor's table is reason enough to be given one?<br /><br />If the victorious are generally so awful, abusive, and corrupt on principal and always to be held in suspicion as Said believes, then why seek a place at their table at all?<br /><br />Throughout 'Representations Of The Intellectual,' Said fails to work his arguments through to their logical conclusions; he seems to lack foresight and have little idea of the 'unintended consequences' that might arise from his desired scenarios.<br /><br />For a proud and vocal advocate of both free thought and speech, Said has very specific, narrow ideas about the role and duties of intellectuals.<br /><br />Statements like \\"the intellectual always has a choice either to side with the weaker, the less well represented, the forgotten or ignored, or to side with the more powerful\\" or \\"I think the major choice faced by the intellectual is whether to be allied with stability the victor and rulers or--the more difficult path--to consider that stability as a state of emergency threatening the less fortunate with the danger of complete extinction, and take into account the experience of subordination itself, as well as the memory of forgotten voices and persons\\" frequently reveal an almost absurd lack of insight into human nature, basic psychology, common sense, and the role these dynamicsplay and have played throughout history.<br /><br />Said prefers to ignore a very broad and diverse world of intellectuals, from the Marquis de Sade through Comte de Lautreamont and on to Charles Darwin, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Friedrich Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, James Frazer, Carl Jung, and T. S. Eliot, whose intellectual worlds, traditions, and, most importantly, conclusions, were remarkably other than those he scrupulously outlines here as absolutes and the only intellectual positions worthy of being esteemed and pursued.<br /><br />And why does one have to be an \\"intellectual\\" at all to side with the minority, the less fortunate, the downtrodden, the 'underdog'?<br /><br />What Said is none too subtly implying is that if a person is intelligent or an \\"intellectual,\\" then the rights of others are naturally always and only foremost in one's mind, a sneaky, backwards-flattering and manipulative tactic which seeks to plant the idea in the reader's mind that \\"I have compassion for others, therefore, I am an intellectual.\\" Similar 'flattery' is found everywhere in Leftist politics today.<br /><br />What Said is utilizing throughout 'Representations Of The Intellectual' is, ironically, not his intellect at all, but his emotional and feeling functions.<br /><br />To reflect its operating principle, the book would more accurately be titled 'Representations of the Compassionate,' and that title would refer not just any expression of \\"compassion,\\" but compassion exactly as Said feels it, and believes it must be directed. In this manner, Said is something of a closet Fascist himself.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, one of Said's \\"heroes\\" has been Theodor Wiesengrund Adorno, who he calls that \\"forbidding but endlessly fascinating man...for me the dominating intellectual conscience of the middle twentieth century.\\"<br /><br />Though the sensitive, erudite Adorno clearly lived a relatively privileged and mobile existence, Said admires the \\"paradoxical, ironic, mercilessly critical\\" Adorno for \\"hating all systems...with equal distaste.\\"<br /><br />Said's lengthy, unintentionally hilarious description make Adorno sound like a colossal, wailing, self-hating, wildly-projecting infant for whom personal responsibility and basic humility were fundamentally unknown qualities.

There is at least no room for pretension or excessive ceremony, no shaking of hands or rubbing of noses, which makes one doubt your sincerity, but hearty as well as hard hand-play. It at least exhibits one of the faces of humanity, the former only a mask,\\" \\"This lament for a golden age is only a lament for golden men\\").<br /><br />Requiring solitude in the manner most require food and shelter, the philosophical, ascetic Thoreau lived most of his life in isolation (\\"The poet must keep himself unstained and aloof\\") as an ardent lover and keen observer of the natural world (\\"All of nature is my bride,\\" \\"My profession is to be always on the alert to find God in nature, to know his lurking-places, to attend all the oratorios, the operas, in nature\\").<br /><br />A comedic misanthrope (\\"I have lived some thirty-odd years on this planet, and I have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my seniors,\\" \\"The society of young women is the most unprofitable I have ever tried\\"), Thoreau also wrote with sympathy, understanding, and concern about the townspeople whose company he preferred not to keep.<br /><br />Even his plain-spoken contempt for the boorish, the smug, the pretentious and the assertively conformist (\\"What men call social virtues, good fellowship, is commonly but the virtue of pigs in a litter, which lie close together to keep each other warm\\") was often tempered with humanity and matter-of-fact acceptance for the inevitable variations of man's psychology.  The simple, the genuine, the uncomplicated and the sincere came in for high marks in Thoreau's estimation of people, places, and things.<br /><br />A Harvard graduate who was born and spent most of his life in New England, bachelor Thoreau set the standard and defined the blueprint for all introverted American artists and thinkers to come.<br /><br />Though Thoreau wrote incessantly and found work as a lecturer, schoolteacher, editor, and tutor at different periods of his life, he typically worked as a gardener, handyman or land surveyor, and spent a particularly frustrating period working in his father's pencil factory.<br /><br />Though he knew himself to be misunderstood by most, Thoreau was uncomplaining (\\"Ah! How I have thriven on solitude and poverty!

Where the metaphorical \\"truth\\" of a particular mythology or philosophy ends, and its reality as a psychic fact begins, is another.<br /><br />Can the unconscious, envisioned as rich, oceanic, and primordial by Jung, really be more accurately \\"re-visioned\\" as an icy, brittle, utterly lightless abode of merciless \\"shades,\\" like the land of the dead portrayed in Ursula Le Guinn's 1972 novel 'The Farthest Shore'?<br /><br />If Hillman is correct, how did human feeling, much less human consciousness and raw instinct, ever arise from this dead and deathless abyss?<br /><br />The birth of consciousness presupposes a kind of evolutionary chain, a process Hillman's hypothesis pointedly ignores.<br /><br />Even when taken strictly in terms of its all-important image theory, 'The Dream And The Underworld' is negatively distinguished by an absence of critical missing links.<br /><br />There are enough flashes of brilliance in 'The Dream And The Underworld' to convince its audience that Hillman, a best-selling author, is about to make an important theoretical breakthrough at any moment.<br /><br />But instead of keen intuitive deduction and perceptive erudition, in each case Hillman heads off on another tangent or takes up the thread of a previously addressed argument for the third or fourth time in as many chapters.<br /><br />Those readers who believe both Freud and Jung were only partially correct (or entirely incorrect) will very likely come away from the odd, static 'The Dream And The Underworld' disappointed, irritated, and questioning the book's uncertain reputation as an important contribution to the field of dream psychology and psychology in general.There are enough flashes of brilliance in 'The Dream And The Underworld' to convince its audience that Hillman, a best-selling author, is about to make an important theoretical breakthrough at any moment.<br /><br />But instead of keen intuitive deduction and perceptive erudition, in each case Hillman heads off on another tangent or takes up the thread of a previously addressed argument for the third or fourth time in as many chapters.<br /><br />Those readers who believe both Freud and Jung were only partially correct (or entirely incorrect) will very likely come away from the odd, static 'The Dream And The Underworld' disappointed, irritated, and questioning the book's uncertain reputation as an important contribution to the field of dream psychology and psychology in general.	2003-06-10

In fact, when all American novels are considered together, only F. Scott Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby' (1925) approaches it in stature.<br /><br />Unlike the often artificial, theatrical, and tongue-in-cheek 'The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer,' 'The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn' is a rollicking, earthy and robust first-person narrative propelled by both dramatic, often hilarious action and masterful characterization.<br /><br />First introduced in 'The Adventures of Tom Sawyer' (1876) as a coarse bumpkin the town elders find undesirable company for other boys, 'The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn' reintroduces Huck as an introverted young lad of fourteen who is both generally naive and cautiously shrewd, uneducated but clever, deeply human, ingenious, and fully accepting of his tattered form and misfit status.<br /><br />While Apollonian Tom carefully plans, creates, and acts out his fantasies and fantasy personas, the simpler, Dionysian, nudity-loving Huckleberry simply is who he believes himself to be. Lacking the need to imagine a larger transcendental identity for himself, Huck spontaneously and consistently lives the sort of vital, active life Tom craves but only sporadically enjoys.<br /><br />For Huck, \\"solid comfort\\" means enjoying a good pipe while resting under a tree in the woods, free of rules, regulations, \\"petticoat despotism,\\" parental figures, \\"social improvement,\\" and scholastic education.<br /><br />But 'The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn' finds its protagonist with little time for blissful rumination. Escaping both his prim, would-be adoptive mother, the Widow Watson, and his abusive, vagabond father by faking his own murder, Huck joins forces with fellow runaway Jim, Miss Watson's black slave and yard hand, upon whom suspicion of the homicide has unfortunately fallen.<br /><br />Setting off down the Mississippi River in whatever vessel is available for the taking, the two embark on a series of calamitous adventures that test their individual strength, resourcefulness, and loyalty to their principles and one another.<br /><br />A product of its time, 'The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn' honestly reflects the racist attitudes prevalent in post Civil War America.<br /><br />Superstitious, gullible, fearful, and constantly wide-eyed in astonishment, Jim is a stereotypical burlesque negro of the period.<br /><br />But, as in Erskine Caldwell's 'Georgia Boy' (1943), Jim, like Caldwell's Handsome Brown, consistently shows strength of character, moral fortitude, common sense, and an frequent admirable penchant for putting the interests of others ahead of his own. Though Jim is the novel's primary fall guy, buffoon, and figure of fun, even a cursory reading of the novel reveals that almost all of the characters, regardless of gender, race, age, or social position, are fools, dupes, charlatans, and aggressively silly, limited personalities caught in their own narrow, selfish perceptions.<br /><br />As British and American folk songs from 'Mattie Groves' and 'Henry Martin' to 'Fennario' and 'Follow The Drinking Gourd' attest, life in the 'good old days' was anything but a bucolic idyll.<br /><br />Though rarely less than comic, 'The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn' reflects this reality: degeneracy, murder, senseless bloody feuds, theft, and mercenary lawlessness are the rule of the day.<br /><br />Unlike 'The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer,' which illustrated a single if protracted episode of evil within small town American life, Huck's story takes place in a larger fallen world in which the white picket fence, bread-and-butter chip pickle life of the earlier book has passed away.<br /><br />Here more than in any other work, Twain proves himself a master of language.<br /><br />Chapter Sixteen, the \\"Raftsman's Passage\\" episode, which the author omitted from the first edition, is a spectacular example of Twain at the height of his literary power.<br /><br />When Huck becomes a stowaway aboard an immense raft by night, he witnesses a group of virile roustabouts and scalawags bragging, boasting, and squaring off around a fire in sneering, full -blooded fashion. Two of the rogues, each 'the baddest of the bad,' circle around one another as their fistfighting duel begins.<br /><br />The first states he is \\"the original iron-jawed, brass-mounted, copper-bellied corpse-maker from the wilds of Arkansas, the man they call Sudden Death and General Desolation...sired by a hurricane, dam'd by an earthquake, half-brother to the cholera, nearly related to the small pox on the mother's side...blood's my natural drink, and the wails of the dying is music to my ears!\\"<br /><br />Not to be outdone, the second admits \\"I scratch my head with the lightning and purr myself to sleep with the thunder...I put my hand on the sun's face and make it night on the earth...I bite a piece out of the moon and hurry the seasons--I shake myself and crumble the mountains. The massacre of isolated communities is the pastime of my idle moments, the destruction of nationalities the serious business of my life!\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, the absurd battle that follows less that justifies their claims of virile dominance and world subjugation.<br /><br />T. S. Eliot wrote enthusiastically about the dominant role the Mississippi River plays in the novel, a questionable position readers may dispute, for 'The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn,' with its emphasis on characterization, action, and down-home folk wisdom, spends little energy on mood or lyrical passages evoking nature at the height of summer.<br /><br />'The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn' finally succeeds, despite wordiness and occasional lengthy uninspired passages, because Huck is humble, self-reliant everyman who modestly seizes the potential in every situation to turn events to his favor--and typically towards the good and the humane.<br /><br />Those editions which include the original illustrations by Edward Windsor Kemble and John Harley should be particularly rewarding to readers.ar example of Twain at the height of his literary power.<br /><br />When Huck becomes a stowaway aboard an immense raft by night, he witnesses a group of virile roustabouts and scalawags bragging, boasting, and squaring off around a fire in sneering, full -blooded fashion.

US	35944741	R2NKBJQWHY6XPL	0820317365	776145697	Georgia Boy	Books	5	15	15	N	N	"Falling Out Over A Little Thing Like Kinship"	Equal parts burlesque, farce, and tall tale, Erskine Caldwell's interrelated short story collection 'Georgia Boy' (1943) finds its author near the peak of his writing talent.<br /><br />Young William Stroup, the observant only child of a poor Georgia family, narrates the fourteen stories. While the endless string of shenanigans William reports clearly demonstrate his father Morris' stupidity, sloth, and immorality, objective William never offers an opinion on his father's behavior.<br /><br />As the stories progress, it becomes clear that while he mildly sympathizes with his hardworking, frustrated, and put-upon mother, William actually admires his father's outrageous breaches of acceptable behavior.<br /><br />Like Jeeter Lester of 'Tobacco Road' (1931) and Ty Ty Walden of 'God's Little Acre' (1933) before him, Morris Stroup is a daydreamer constantly on the lookout for 'pie in the sky' and any shortcut to prosperity, no matter how absurd, outlandish, or illegal.<br /><br />In fact, the Stroups stand somewhere between the Lesters and the Waldens in terms of socialization; while they are not as backward, uneducated, and dispossessed as the poorest-of-the-poor-Lesters, the Stroups lack the Walden's daring-do, ingenuity, marginal prosperity, and relatively strong interrelationships.<br /><br />Like the Lesters, the Stroups live in a house divided: since the extraverted Morris is constantly misbehaving on a grand scale, William's mother (\\"Ma\\") finds it necessary to constantly be on her guard against her husband's latest transgression.  One of the book's hilarious running jokes is Ma telling William to \\"go in the house right this instant and shut the doors and pull down the window shades\\" so she can confront Morris alone with his latest deception, chase him with a broom, or throw any object available in his direction.<br /><br />Like most men and teenage boys in Caldwell's fiction, Morris thinks with his genitals and stomach first.<br /><br />When Ma is not suffering due to Morris's behavior, Handsome Brown, the Black \\"yard boy,\\" is. Handsome lives in a shed on the Morris property and receives only food and occasional secondhand clothing for his work.<br /><br />Though Handsome is thrown from a second-story roof into a deep well, attacked for hours by a flock of woodpeckers, and hit repeatedly in the face with baseballs due to Morris's wild machinations, Handsome also shows far more common and moral sense than any other character in the book.<br /><br />Handsome, who has a slight lazy streak of his own, also does most of the work around the house, while Morris \\"hasn't done an honest day's work in ten years.\\"<br /><br />While Morris is clearly a fool in every sense, Handsome is only a fool in Morris's unthinking opinion: Morris unquestioningly considers Handsome a lesser being strictly on the basis of his race.<br /><br />But Morris is an archetypal fool extraordinaire, ridiculously bringing one avoidable disaster after another upon his head.  A pure fool, Morris is incapable of learning from his mistakes or perceiving his own culpability, lacks foresight entirely, and regardless of the outcome of his actions, still manages to have a high opinion of himself as a 'hail-fellow-well-met,' kind, light-hearted individual.<br /><br />The stories of 'Georgia Boy' abound with loaded, riotous situations, most of which have been precipitated by Morris.<br /><br />The Stroup home is invaded by caravans of marauding gypsies; the roof of their two-story house becomes home to a family of goats; Morris discovers that a young widow likes having her toes tickled with a chicken feather; Ma discovers her precious ribbon-bound love letters and the church's new hymnals have disappeared; Morris decides to become the town's dog catcher; Handsome decides to run off to work for the circus; Morris decides to purchase and bright yellow and green necktie he can't afford and has no use for; Morris decides his neighbors have less use for their own property thanhe does; Ma decides Morris's cock fighting days have to come to an end.<br /><br />As in his other early fiction, Caldwell excels at characterization, even while his men, women, and children tend to run to type.<br /><br />Caldwell had a genius for comedy that stretches the boundaries of probability without ever going too far.

US	35944741	R141ASUGEEN7F	0393313905	664152977	The House by the Sea: A Journal	Books	3	22	31	N	N	Fanfare For The Common Man	Literary journals and diaries written for publication are notoriously dicey cultural products. Harold Nicholson's extensive journals were written self-consciously with a reading public clearly in mind, and novelist, diarist, and bigamist Anais Nin rewrote her decades-long diary when she finally found an opportunity to publish it, editing out multiple critical facts concerning her life in the process; the end result was a frothy fabrication rather than an accurate reflection of her existence.<br /><br />May Sarton's frequently irritating 'The House By The Sea' (1976) is the second of her published journals. Experimental first volume 'Journal Of A Solitude' (1973), an unexpected success, was written with painful honesty and only tentative confidence while the author was living alone in a small New Hampshire village.<br /><br />By contrast, in 'The House By The Sea,' Sarton immediately makes it clear that this volume has been commissioned. During the writing of the first, Sarton was caught in a tumultuous romantic relationship, experiencing herself as &#34;old and useless,&#34; and discovering that she could no longer write poetry.<br /><br />But 'The House By The Sea' finds Sarton wisely questioning whether or not she has anything worthwhile to say that might justify a second volume. It also reveals that Sarton's previous home in Nelson, New Hampshire, was in fact on the village green in the center of town. Sarton, then, was living alone, as millions of people do, and, like many of those millions, surrounded by and with ready access to other men and women. Thus Sarton's claim to &#34;solitude&#34; in the first volume becomes highly questionable.<br /><br />Sarton, now living alone in a truly isolated, three-story, oceanfront house in Maine, complains continually about the weather, about the imperfect state of her massive lawn and garden, about having routine housework to do, and is often unhappy when she has guests, but chronically longs for human companionship when's she's alone.<br /><br />'The House By The Sea' makes it clear that Sarton is a conflicted individual with little objective sense of her privileged status.<br /><br />Sarton shares that she has attended Bloombury parties and known Virginia Woolf, Kenneth Clark, Elizabeth Bowen, Vladimir Nabokov, Archibald Macleish, Hilda Doolittle, the Huxleys, and other literary luminaries; she has lived in and traveled extensively through Europe; she has had a home in Cambridge, and taught at some of the most prestigious universities in America; she has and has had friends in influential places, and has been able to publish her novels and poetry for decades.<br /><br />All of which makes Sarton's petty grumbling, however sincere, rather smarmy.<br /><br />As in 'Journal Of A Solitude,' Sarton contradicts herself and often evidences the same kind of behavior she denounces. She states that her elderly, lifelong friend Celine Limbosch looks &#34;like a poor sad old monkey,&#34; and Alison Lurie &#34;a gentle perceptive witch,&#34; two expressions she would find objectionable if coming from a man or woman if directed against herself.<br /><br />She allows herself to be published in Reader's Digest, a venue Virginia Woolf and Sarton's other friends would have had nothing but contempt for, but months later asks why &#34;inspirational writing such as appears in Reader's Digest&#34; makes her &#34;feel angry and upset...sick, cheated, and debased.&#34;<br /><br />She goes on at length about two women friends who she feels had illusions about their talent as poets, and says about one, &#34;She was talented but she did not learn anything over the years. The poetry was too abstract and generalized. She never discovered the power of a strong metaphor to lead her to the truth. So what remains is a little theatrical and a little self-indulgent.&#34; To those who have read Sarton's poetry, these statements will sound like displacement and the kettle calling the pot black. One of the obvious sources of Sarton's rage in 'Journal Of A Solitude' was her lack of an accurate estimation of her own published work.<br /><br />Instead of taking the time to exam her thoughts and feelings before taking up her pen, Sarton prefers short sentences punctuated with exclamation points: &#34;How much we forget, and how much that was fresh and clear gets overlaid!&#34; &#34;At last the braces have gone from Tommy's teeth!&#34; &#34;The greatest achievement of the day was shortening a pair of pants!&#34; &#34;She went out on the porch outside her bedroom and sketched immediately after she arrived!&#34; &#34;A grand day on the water!&#34;<br /><br />For a book with literary aspirations, 'The House By The Sea' is absolutely laden with exclamation points; there is at least one every third page, and some pages include two or more. Sarton also resorts to surprisingly coarse expressions like &#34;we gobbled it up.&#34;<br /><br />Sensitive, ivory tower-dwelling Sarton offers a lot of undigested, liberal-leaning opinions on the &#34;state of our inner cities,&#34; writing that the subject is a cause of &#34;constant anxiety&#34; and morning tears.<br /><br />As in the first journal, Sarton's relationship with and judgment about animals and other subjects at times seems questionable. When Sarton finds a healthy baby rabbit in her cat's mouth, instead of nursing it in a box within an enclosed room, or calling the ASPCA for assistance, Sarton drives to a field and abandons it there, with pious hopes that it will be able to &#34;fend for itself.&#34;<br /><br />When she has four guests over for dinner, she buys only a pound and a half of lobster meat to prepare a lobster salad, and happily discovers after the meal that there is salad leftover, giving readers cause to suspect that the polite family probably bolted for a MacDonald's upon departure.<br /><br />When she purchases fifty pounds of sunflower seeds for the birds, she thinks $15.50 is a &#34;staggering&#34; price to pay for it.<br /><br />'The House By The Sea' lacks focus, a pure motive, and substance, but Sarton was an earnest, well-intentioned person struggling with herself as well as with the simple day to day problems common to everyone.<br /><br />Less acute than its predecessor, the journal nonetheless succeeds in allowing readers to enter the private, uneasy life of a creative person.ublished work.

The series' most enduring image is that of Georgie peering out from the center attic window, for the cluttered attic is the room that Georgie calls his own.  Every night at the appointed time, Georgie descends from his attic and, by causing a loose board on the stairs to creak and the hinges of a door to squeak, reminds Mr. And Mrs. Whittaker that it is time for bed, Herman the cat that it is time to prowl, and Mrs. Oliver the owl that it is time to wake up for the night.<br /><br />'Georgie And The Robbers' tells the simple story of what happens when burglars invade the Whittaker home after the trusting couple leave to attend a church social with the doors unlocked.  Of course, Georgie, Herman, Mrs. Oliver, and the family cow unite to foil the evildoers.<br /><br />The apparently childless Whittakers are a proper, middle-aged couple who sit side by side every night with contented smiles on their faces.  Mrs. Whittaker knits, while Mr. Whittaker simply reclines and rests his feet.  Might Georgie be the spirit of a Whittaker child that has passed away?  Bright makes it clear that Georgie is the ghost of a young boy, but his origins are otherwise left in mystery.  Though he remains unseen by the Whittakers, he clearly esteems them, and indeed has a loving relationship with all the members of the family, both human and animal.<br /><br />In fact, Georgie turns the adult-child relationship on its head, since it is the ghost who is the caregiver and guardian in his relationship to his loved ones.  Has Georgie been a ghost for centuries, or decades, or for only a short period?  Always smiling, Georgie clearly lives in homey comfort at the Whittaker estate.<br /><br />Robert Bright was a charming storyteller as well as a moody, excellent illustrator known for his blue ink and blue pencil drawings.  His bucolic New England village and the surrounding countryside seem to exist in a state of perpetual autumn: the trees are continually shedding the last of their leaves, the moonlit fields of corn and wheat stretch endlessly out towards the horizons of the night, and the winding country lanes are distant, windswept, and lonely.  The Victorian Whittaker house is full of antique gramophones, spinning wheels, overstuffed chairs, veiled lamps, Edwardian loveseats, straw boaters, umbrella stands, flowered wallpaper, and grand staircases.<br /><br />The 'Georgie' series make an excellent introduction to the lighter side of the supernatural in entertainment.  Parents can use the books to introduce it and other subjects, such as Halloween, to very young audiences.  The series might also be used to comfortably familiarize children with the idea of death, since Georgie's state of being will require explanation in some instances.  Never less than warm and humorous, the series also teaches independence, ingenuity, practicality, responsibility, and careful regard for all others. Always modestly heroic, Georgie is one of twentieth century America's most beloved contributions to children's literature.t was a charming storyteller as well as a moody, excellent illustrator known for his blue ink and blue pencil drawings.

But as her next published journal, 'The House By the Sea' will reveal, Sarton's New Hampshire home was right in the center of the village, making her claim to &#34;solitude&#34; rather specious, certainly relative.<br /><br />By 1973, Sarton was sixty-one years of age and an established novelist and poet who had known and corresponded with such literary luminaries as Virginia Woolf and Hilda Doolittle.<br /><br />'Journal Of A Solitude' is a warm, touching, and very human book, which, after its successful publication, became the cornerstone upon which Sarton's uneasy reputation has settled. But 'Journal Of A Solitude' also reveals Sarton to have been something of an odd duck modestly dressed in the clothing, mores, and mannerisms of a genteel Belgian lady.<br /><br />Sadly, what Sarton seems determined not to come to terms with is that she was a tepid, literal-minded poet as well as a less than first-rate literary novelist; this is important, because the lack of critical attention her work received (&#34;What I have not had is the respect due what is now a considerable opus&#34;) is a constant theme of the book and source of tension.<br /><br />As a result, &#34;ornery&#34; Sarton shifts continuously between states of creative over appraisal and damning self-recrimination. Sarton's quoted poems clearly reveal a lack of lyrical skill and an absence of any visionary power whatsoever.<br /><br />Though she states, &#34;Whatever peace I know rests in the natural world,&#34; 'Journal Of A Solitude' also reveals a tender-hearted animal lover and enthusiastic gardener who nonetheless appears to lack a higher sense of nature as a symbol, sign, or metaphor for the transcendent forces evident in human reality.<br /><br />Badly advised by friend and poet Louise Bogan to &#34;keep the Hell&#34; out of her work, Sarton, accepting Bogan's suggestion, struggles daily with a devastating, irrational temper, depression serious enough to drive her to suicidal states, loneliness, and, at only sixty-one, a sense of herself as &#34;old, dull, and useless.&#34;<br /><br />Sarton, who appears to have surprisingly little self-knowledge for a person of her age, is haunted by reoccurring image of &#34;plants, bulbs, in the cellar, trying to grow without light, putting out white shoots that will inevitably wither,&#34; but doesn't consciously relate this image directly to herself or her difficult present.<br /><br />When a close friend visits for several days, Sarton is incensed when the woman makes an offhand comment about the faded state of a vase of flowers (though as the photographs included reveal, flower arranging was not among Sarton's talents).<br /><br />Clearly, some or most of Sarton's &#34;hell&#34; should have gone into and fueled her creative work, as it does in the case of most artists. Is appears that there were many things in her life that Sarton simply did not want to confront or acknowledge.<br /><br />Sarton makes contradictory statements about God and her religious beliefs, commenting first that writing poetry is her method of communicating with God, but later states, &#34;I am not a believer.&#34;<br /><br />Though she frequently writes at length about the emancipation of women and the need for the abolition of gender roles, she also makes generalized statements like &#34;nurturing is women's work,&#34; and believes that &#34;blacks&#34; have the &#34;grace and instinct and intuitive understanding&#34; necessary for the nursing profession.<br /><br />Today, Sarton's expression &#34;we have so much to learn from them [&#34;blacks&#34;]&#34; sounds something like well-intended but unconsciously smug pandering.<br /><br />Sarton was not an intellectual, but the limited perspective cumulatively elaborated in her novels and poetry found a ready audience in &#34;nice&#34; like-minded women for whom more challenging female authors like Muriel Spark, Isak Dinesen, Virginia Woolf, Jean Rhys, Katherine Anne Porter, or Jane Bowles apparently represented an arduous uphill climb.<br /><br />What 'Journal of a Solitude' does illustrate is the danger of making an unquestioning habit of &#34;impeccable&#34; WASP manners and politeness over a lifetime. Sarton, her close friends, and colleagues all appear to exist in a brittle world where truthful communication and direct, honest criticism are to be strenuously avoided in the name of continued social niceties.<br /><br />Sadly, the success of' Journal Of A Solitude' had an ultimately negative effect on Sarton's career, as she began producing journal volume after journal volume ('Recovering,' 'At Seventy,' 'After The Stroke,' 'Endgame: A Journal Of The Seventy-Ninth Year,' etc.), of which only 'The House By The Sea,' which immediately followed the present volume, had the same freshness, integrity, and lack of self-consciousness.<br /><br />Sarton was soon to become a cottage industry for her publishers, turning out further volumes of banal poetry--&#34;Moose In The Morning&#34;--and, like Edith Sitwell in old age, simply publishing too much without due editorial consideration.<br /><br />'Journal Of A Solitude' does reflect a genuine, shadow-casting human presence as well as a state of being which many people, especially the creative, the introverted, and those moving uncertainly towards later life may respond to fully.<br /><br />Sarton's moments of anxiety, despair, and doubt, as well as her stoicism, fortitude, and courage, are sincerely expressed, touching, and inspiring.  Sarton accurately perceived herself to be country-loving, intelligent, and serenity-seeking individual who put a high premium on the simpler aspects of life.<br /><br />But for an author who had over twenty books published by 1973 and who was on a first-name basis with some of literature's most notoriously critical figures, Sarton was a surprisingly unsophisticated person.<br /><br />As a result, it is the fallible human being, and not the creative writer, who shines most brightly in 'Journal Of A Solitude.'women for whom more challenging female authors like Muriel Spark, Isak Dinesen, Virginia Woolf, Jean Rhys, Katherine Anne Porter, or Jane Bowles apparently represented an arduous uphill climb.

US	35944741	R1A0JY8KUJ42B3	1576871487	438151451	Clown Paintings	Books	4	12	12	N	N	Demi-Gods Of The Sawdust	With 'Clown Paintings' (2002), idiosyncratic actor, author, and director Diane Keaton has produced the kind of offbeat creative work that is sorely lacking in American culture today.  'Clown Paintings' is just what is appears to be: a slim compendium of presumably amatuer clown paintings which were happily discovered at swap meets, yard sales, bargain bins, and thrift stores.<br /><br />What makes 'Clown Paintings' surprising is that Keaton treats the sixty-six paintings as oddball if serious pieces of work, and pointedly avoids treating them as banal, ironic objects of kitsch or high or low camp.  Created roughly over a period of thirty years, all of the paintings were made by unknown artists, and many are unsigned, further obscuring their etiology.<br /><br />Keaton and Los Angeles gallery owner Robert Berman each contribute a brief but fascinating essay.  Keaton, a well-known comedian herself, perceives clowns as perpetually bright-eyed innocents and eternally hopeful beings that are easily wounded but fundamentally incapable of learning from negative experience or their own mistakes.<br /><br />Noting that clowns were acceptable enough subjects for Picasso, Beckmann, and Matisse, Keaton believes that clowns images \\"expose the human experience at its most transcendent on one hand, and on the other, its most tragic.\\"  Berman, who thinks \\"one clown painting alone may look like a silly indulgence,\\" dreams \\"of a gallery full of clowns, floor to ceiling, walls of clowns - so powerful that the viewers would be overwhelmed.\\"<br /><br />Keaton has asked a broad range of mostly-American comedians to comment on the subject, including Woody Allen, Don Knotts, Phyllis Diller, Carol Burnett, Ben Stiller, Chevy Chase, Sandra Bernhard, and Jerry Lewis.  Not surprisingly, most of those solicited find both clowns and their painted images appalling, frightening, repulsive, or subtle metaphors for psychopathology.  With few exceptions, these short commentaries are insightful and touching rather than merely glib or clever.  Based on the written selections, it appears clowns are rarely if ever a neutral subject. Like garden gnomes, clowns seem to be \\"loved by millions, and loathed by millions more.\\"<br /><br />What 'Clown Paintings' only barely touches upon is the clown as an archetypal trickster figure, a psychopomp, a mythical straddler of at least two conflicting states, a figure perpetually at the crossroads, a subversive, borderland creature who manifests in dreams, childhood memories, literature, popular entertainment, consumerism, world history, and in the gray area of symbol and metaphor.<br /><br />Clowns are and have been everywhere and nowhere at once throughout history, like witches. As with all numinous images, they both reveal and conceal simultaneously.  Are clowns predominantly good or predominantly evil?  Trustworthy or innately figures of suspicion? Well-intended or conspicuously devious?  Social outcasts or masters of their fates? Where does the man end, and the clown artifice begin?  Are clowns partially transvestite figures?  Or gussied-up memento moris?  Like glamorized, inverted modern Medusas, clowns and clown images are capable of eliciting at least a brief fit of paralysis in their audience or viewer.<br /><br />Despite their apparent obviousness and bluntness, these paintings, which underscore several American traditions, proudly maintain their mystery, even when their dignity seems to be faltering.  Regardless of the viewer's discipline or angle of approach, their secrets remain inscrutable and thus safe forever.  Curious readers willing to give these pieces their time will be adequately rewarded, for, ultimately, 'Clown Paintings' is an eccentric, funhouse-mirror meditation on the strangeness of being human.uching rather than merely glib or clever.

Bright, sassy, dauntless, charming, and shrewd, Tom embodies the archetype of every healthy, mischievous, and extroverted American boy.<br /><br />The book's plot, probably better known to most readers today via cinematic versions of the story, is uncomplicated. Tom tricks and antagonizes his beloved, easily outraged Aunt Polly, develops a frustrating crush on young schoolmate Becky Thatcher, tricks his pals into doing his chores, reinvents himself as a pirate on the Mississippi, and, with Huckleberry Finn, runs afoul of Injun Joe when they unexpectedly witness a murder in a graveyard at midnight.<br /><br />Like every good story with a traditional structure, the narrative offers a series of contrasts, here between the comfortable, familiar, sunlit world of St. Petersburg and the events that occur when curious Tom strips back daylight's veil and peers into the community's secret life.<br /><br />Interestingly, with 'The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer,' the clever Twain was writing about present day (1880s) America, but simultaneously already portraying that era in nostalgic, sentimental terms.<br /><br />Thus, today's readers may find in a double nostalgia in the novel: the first, their own, focused on a longing for America's mythological \\"simpler times,\\" and the second a reflection of the homey, intimate, bumpkin-, eccentric- , and \\"character\\"-ridden American small town that Twain provided for the readers of his own era.<br /><br />By writing so powerfully about boyhood, Twain offers readers of all eras yet another powerful provocation towards nostalgia: that for one's own lost childhood, youthful initiations, and passages from innocence into adulthood.<br /><br />The novel contains seductive, lulling passages of great poetic beauty, such as the following: \\"He entered a dense wood, picked his pathless way to the centre of it, and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak. There was not even a zephyr stirring; the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds; nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far-off hammering of a woodpecker, and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound. The boy's soul was steeped in melancholy; his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. He sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands, meditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble at best, and he more than half envied Jimmy Hodges, so lately released. It must be peaceful, he thought, to lie and slumber and dream for ever and ever, with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers of the grave, and nothing to bother and grieve about, ever any more.\\"<br /><br />However, most of the book is written in a tone of buoyant theatrical artificiality: in episode after episode, Twain carefully sets his audience up for the punch lines to follow, and does so in a fashion that unabashedly reveals his own calculation as well as his intention that the reader be able to predict exactly what is to come. Even the narrative's tragedy-leaning moments are eventually punctured by corny, charming, tongue-in-cheek humor which seems to suggest that life, when well balanced, is primarily a pleasant affair of straw hats, freckled skin, rolled-up dungarees, molasses candy, indolent summer days, fishing tackle, white picket fences, and lovely chintz wallpaper.<br /><br />A defining moment in American literature, 'The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer' is an evocative, light, and fanciful book littered with shrewd social commentary and fragments of wisdom and insight composed by an American master at the height of his powers.sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak.

It isn't difficult to understand how and why Genet was able to reproduce the novel under such circumstances, because 'Our Lady Of The Flowers' is nothing less than a mythic recreation of Genet's past and then-present history.<br /><br />Combining memories with facts, fantasies, speculations, irrational dreams, tender emotion, empathy, and philosophical insights, Genet probably made his isolation bearable by retreating into a world not only of his own making, but one over which he had total control.<br /><br />The imprisoned narrator \\"Jean,\\" who may or may not be identical with the author, masturbates regularly; like a perpetual motion machine, his fantasies fuel his writing and his writing spurs on his fantasies in turn.<br /><br />Nothing illustrates this more than the brief scene in which self-sustaining \\"Jean\\" describes an act of auto-fellatio. \\"Jean\\" is not only the serpent that eats its tail but becomes a small, circular, self - imbibing universe all his own.  A motto attributed to the alchemists could be the narrator's own: \\"Every man his own wife.\\"<br /><br />Though the narrative is not the primary focus of this or any of Genet's novels, most responsible critics have failed to remark on the fact that the narrative of 'Our Lady Of The Flowers' is the least compelling of any found in his five major novels.  'Our Lady Of The Flowers', does, however, lay the basic groundwork for the finer novels to come: 'The Miracle Of The Rose,' 'Funeral Rites,' 'Querelle,' and 'The Thief's Journal' (all written between 1944 and 1948).<br /><br />While 'Our Lady Of The Flowers' is Genet's only novel to feature a predominantly effeminate homosexual man (Divine, who is at least partially a transvestite) as its protagonist (\\"Our Lady Of The Flowers,\\" a virile young thug, is a secondary character), most of the other elements of the book will be very familiar to those who have read the balance of his fiction.<br /><br />Transvestites and transvestite figures abound, as do handsome, amoral, and homosexual or bisexual \\"toughs,\\" jokes and extended vignettes concerned with lice, flatulence, constipation, and feces, mordant examinations of manhood and the criminal's code of honor, obsession with personal power through emotional betrayal, the long vagabond road to \\"sainthood,\\" theft, masochistic love, prostitution, and vivid examples of the way in which physical desire and sexuality secretly and subtly fuel, in Genet's view, almost every aspect of life.<br /><br />As in portions of his other novels, the characters here, even the swaggering, virile young men, are known among their friends by fey pet names like \\"Darling Daintyfoot,\\" \\"Mimosa,\\" and \\"Our Lady of the Flowers,\\" which are intended to be simultaneously affectionate and mocking.<br /><br />To further confuse, Divine is referred to as a \\"he\\" and referred to his surname during his youth and as a \\"she\\" and \\"Divine\\" in maturity.<br /><br />As in 'The Miracle of the Rose' and 'Funeral Rites,' characters mesh into one another, exchange identities, and move backward and forward through time at the narrator's whim.<br /><br />Both \\"Jean\\" and the individual characters fuse their own and each other's personalities together as needed, and all occasionally lose control of this process: but Jean Genet, master puppeteer, never does.<br /><br />Genet's readers are probably aware of the existence of haughty establishment critics who pretentiously embrace Genet's work but nonetheless treat it like something best held at the end of a very long stick.<br /><br />\\"Evil\\" is the word most commonly used to describe Genet's fiction by anxiousmiddlebrow critics who, while distressingly stimulated by his work, feel duty-bound to officially decry its potential for pernicious influence.<br /><br />Many artists are said to create a \\"moral universe\\" within the body of their work; Genet is one of the few that actually does, though his is a mirror universe where amorality reigns.<br /><br />Genet's world is so exclusively concerned with flea-ridden prostitutes, child murderers who don't wipe themselves, handsome pimps who eat what they scratch out of their noses, prostitutes with rotting teeth, strutting, uneducated alpha male hustlers, and masochistic sodomites--bourgeois emblems of horror all--that the question of \\"evil\\" as such in Genet's work becomes obsolete.<br /><br />While Genet loves and personally glorifies his memories, fictional recreations and their outcast lifestyles, he never objectively condones their actions to his audience.<br /><br />In all of his novels, Genet finds beauty, suffering, and vulnerability--humanity--in everyone, thus setting a far better example than his hypocritical reviewers.<br /><br />There is as much \\"evil\\" in Genet's books as there is represented by any typical novel's reality principle (for example, all of Genet's characters reveal more humanity and innate dignity than the crass, vacuous crowd Nick Carraway falls in with in Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby') or, for that matter, as there is in the lives of those unstable, morally-confused critics who are simply too cowardly to recognize the world as the diverse, dangerous, devouring, and unstable place that it is.<br /><br />If 'Our Lady Of The Flowers' proves anything, it's that fifty years after its initial publication, the book is still effectively upsetting the wormy apple carts Genet intended it to.<br /><br />From the standpoint of Jung's psychological types, Genet's feeling and sensation functions probably predominated in both his life and his writing.<br /><br />However, his thinking and intuition functions were clearly constellated as well, giving 'Our Lady Of The Flowers' and the masterpieces that followed it unmatched macrocosmic perceptiveness, poetic resonance, and gripping, all-inclusive dramatic power.<br /><br />Like alchemical \\"totality\\" the hermaphrodite, a shaman, or a legitimate Christian saint, mystic Genet seems to have written from a state of undifferentiated consciousness and enjoyed a state of perpetual participation mystique with life.middlebrow critics who, while distressingly stimulated by his work, feel duty-bound to officially decry its potential for pernicious influence.<br /><br />Many artists are said to create a \\"moral universe\\" within the body of their work;

In fact, 'The Philosopher's Secret Fire' reads like a sequel to the first book.  While 'Daimonic Reality' dealt directly with cases of paranormal and metaphysical visitation, 'The Philosopher's Secret Fire' underscores and elaborates on the history of Western culture's &#34;golden thread,&#34; Harpur's name for the centuries-old ideas, beliefs, and mystical traditions which have attempted to identify, name, and encompass the broadest possible view of the nature of reality.  Harpur's work stands as a considerable reproof against books like Daniel Pinchbeck's recent 'Break Open the Head' and other earnest but ill-conceived works which attempt a grasp at the inexplicable.<br /><br />Beginning with Plato and moving through the Neoplatonists, Christian mystics, Renaissance High Magicians, alchemists, Enlightenment scientists and philosophers, Romantic poets, and 20th century depth psychologists, Harpur lays down an extremely complex argument in the simplest of language.<br /><br />Plotinus is here, as are Heraclitus, Cornelius Agrippa, Jacob Boehme, John Dee, Paracelsus, Copernicus, Immanuel Kant, Isaac Newton, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Charles Darwin, William Butler Yeats, and Carl Jung, among several dozen others.<br /><br />In Harpur's view, each of these men (no significant female figures are included, leaving readers to speculate about what Harpur has overlooked or dismissed) added important contributions as well as errors in theory to the historical chain of elevated knowledge.  With a keen understanding of metaphor, symbol, allegory and other figurative expressions of language, Harpur, working with an incredible overview of timelines, moves from author to author and idea to idea, adding and subtracting conclusions and ultimately building his own very solid equation.<br /><br />Unlike Daniel Pinchbeck, who argues that natural and artificial hallucinogens are the most reliable method of perceiving and interacting with the world of spirits, Harpur is wise enough to know that thousands of people all over the planet suffer or enjoy unexpected contact with &#34;daimons&#34;--intermediary spirits--every day, and usually without desire, foreknowledge, or belief in their existence.<br /><br />Whether manifesting as phantom animals, fairies, channeled or medium-visiting spirits of the dead, &#34;gypsies on the roof,&#34; vanishing hitchhikers, poltergeists, unidentifiable aerial phenomena, voodoo loa, &#34;soul guides,&#34; lake monsters, &#34;men in black,&#34; hairy humanoids, the &#34;terrors that come in the night,&#34; alien &#34;grays,&#34; or even the mysterious quasars at the ends of the known universe, Harpur argues that mankind coexists and always has coexisted with these entities throughout time.<br /><br />Natural parts of the reality of the universe, the slippery daimons dwell nowhere and everyone at once: in the Anima Mundi or &#34;soul of the world,&#34; in our speculative laws of physics, and in the mankind's conscious and unconscious psyche, specifically in the human imagination (as defined in higher and lower forms by Samuel Taylor Coleridge).  Harpur's final argument appears to be that not only is the daimonic world simultaneously &#34;real&#34; and metaphorical, but that everything we call reality is both &#34;real&#34; and metaphorical, including mankind.<br /><br />Intelligent readers with an active or innate sense of the miraculous will gain the most from 'The Philosopher's Secret Fire.'  Reality as portrayed by Harpur is not a sterile, meaningless, stagnant plane at the inevitable mercy of entropy, but a place where &#34;God might at any moment make himselfmanifest out of the wind or the clouds.&#34;<br /><br />Highly recommended to those seeking enlightened answers to some of the fundamental questions of Western civilization.ose seeking enlightened answers to some of the fundamental questions of Western civilization.	2003-04-21

Books	5	17	19	N	Y	With A Roar And A Rank Odor	Like his two other classic novels, 'Tobacco Road' (1931) and the less popular 'Journeyman' (1935), Erskine Caldwell's masterpiece, 'God's Little Acre' (1933) is a funny, sensual, raw, and powerful novel whose tragic story is loosely structured within a mythological framework.<br /><br />Uneducated protagonist and patriarch Ty Ty Walden is a Georgia farmer who is gleefully obsessed with the idea that there is a literal gold mine  waiting to be discovered somewhere in his land's soil.<br /><br />Optimistic Ty Ty (whose two favorite expressions are \\"what in the pluperfect hell?\\" and \\"Well I'll be a suck-egg mule\\") has spent almost two decades fruitlessly digging fifteen-foot deep holes across his farm, like an archetypal searcher after fairy gold or pirate treasure.<br /><br />Far from reflecting Thoreau's conservatorial ideas about nature at Walden Pond, the Walden farm is slowly falling to ruin; fewer and fewer crops are planted each year, and the huge craters in the earth are left gaping.  To make the process more \\"scientific,\\" Ty Ty and his two antagonistic sons, Buck and Shaw, have violently kidnapped albino Dave Dawson, who they believe will be able to \\"divine\\" the location of the lode due to his freakish \\"betwixt and between\\" status.<br /><br />The starving black sharecroppers on the farm perceive the swamp-dwelling Dave as a daimonic \\"conjur\\" figure, and flee in terror.<br /><br />Hoping to pacify his creator and perhaps turn his luck, Ty Ty has continually designated one parcel of his land as \\"God's little acre,\\" the harvest from which belongs to the Lord.<br /><br />Though he has promised himself he will always forward the proceeds of the acre to the church, Ty Ty, fearing that he may be accidentally promising away his as-yet undiscovered gold, moves 'God's little acre' from one area to another whenever the whim strikes him.<br /><br />Thus, one of the book's subtle motifs is a semiconscious denial of divine forces.<br /><br />Ty Ty half-heartedly appeases his god with one hand while reneging on the deal with the other. \\"Blood on my land,\\" a not uncommon motif in Western literature, is the result.<br /><br />Though the Walden family is far more socialized than the Lesters of 'Tobacco Road,' they are nonetheless all blissfully ignorant and happily unconscious of themselves.<br /><br />Ty Ty, his sons, and his son-in-law think nothing of making aggressive, groping passes at one another's wives or any other woman they think attractive, whether alone or in one another's company.  \\"It's all in the family, ain't it?\\" says visionary son-in-law Will.<br /><br />Ty Ty goes so far as to say to Buck's beautiful wife Griselda, \\"The first time I saw you...I felt like getting right down there and licking something.\\"<br /><br />Blushing Griselda, embarrassed but also touched by what she perceives as a compliment made in front of the gathered family, merely says, \\"Aw, now, Pa.\\"<br /><br />For all of the men and most of the women, just about anyone is fair sexual game, regardless of age, race, creed, or status within the family or society.<br /><br />Daughter Darling Jill, continually on the lookout for erotic novelty, seduces her sister's husband and escorts Dave into the darkness behind the house on his first night of capture.  For all of the Waldens, ardent sexual desire is a sign of vigor, health, and stamina; for everyone except Buck and daughter Rosamund, almost all sexual activity is of little or no consequence, either before or after the fact.<br /><br />Contrarily, a drowsy spell also seems to hang over the farm: several of the characters, including Ty Ty, lose their impetus, momentum, and motivation from moment to moment, so that a thirty - second return to the house to retrieve a forgotten item delays a motor trip by several hours; simply rising from a chair in the late afternoon sun is an action that takes concentration, will, and decisive resolve.<br /><br />Like the Lesters, the Walden clan, rutting animals all, are as much a tribe as a family.  \\"Share and share alike\\" could be their motto; no high premium is set on individuality or personal development.<br /><br />When political hopeful Pluto Swint (Pluto has eyes the size of \\"watermelon seeds\\" and is morbidly obese: appropriately, his surname a cross between 'squint' and 'swine'), the novel's loudly-dressed, constantly sweating court jester and patsy, arrives on the farm to canvas votes (upon encountering albino prisoner Dave, the first thing Pluto says is, \\"Who's that? Is he a voter?\\"), he immediately falls prey to the family's miasmic collective unconsciousness and the torpor in the air.<br /><br />The book's secondary plot revolves around Promethean son-in-law Will, the leader of a group of striking mill workers in a small South Carolina town.  Unlike the rest of the Waldens, Will has visionary power in addition to a robust physique and 'willful' determination and inner confidence.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Will has a series of dreamy reveries in which the mill is again fully operational, the hungry strikers are gainfully employed, and pretty, respectful young local girls, with their luscious \\"rising beauties,\\" are awaiting their bread-earning spouses and lovers outside the factory walls at dusk.<br /><br />Like his father-in-law Ty Ty, Will has more than a touch of the enchanted poet about him.  As if momentarily captured by fairies, Will awakens from his visions to find that he has been taken \\"away\\" and then \\"returned\\" to the present.  Despite his penchant for alcoholism, womanizing, and spousal abuse, the still Christ-like Will is the heart and soul of 'God's Little Acre,' and the subject of some of Caldwell's most powerful writing.<br /><br />Banned in Boston and attacked by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice upon release, 'God's Little Acre,' which has one of the most suspenseful climaxes in Twentieth century American literature, went on to sell more than 10 million copies.  Ultimately more hopeful, warm, and uplifting than the farcical 'Tobacco Road,' 'God's Little Acre' displays Caldwell's vision at its broadest and finds the author at the height of his fictional powers.h a tribe as a family.  \\"Share and share alike\\" could be their motto; no high premium is set on individuality or personal development.<br /><br />When political hopeful Pluto Swint (Pluto has eyes the size of \\"watermelon seeds\\" and is morbidly obese: appropriately, his surname a cross between 'squint' and 'swine'), the novel's loudly-dressed, constantly sweating court jester and patsy, arrives on the farm to canvas votes (upon encountering albino prisoner Dave, the first thing Pluto says is, \\"Who's that?

throughout her life she managed to straddle a great number of seeming paradoxes and today remains potent proof that many Western conventions concerning love, marriage, parenthood, sexuality, and friendship are as not as tightly mapped out as most would generally like to believe.<br /><br />Unlike fellow writers and contemporaries Hilda Doolittle, Djuna Barnes, or Jean Rhys, her excesses, dependencies, and emotional vacillations did not ultimately undo Vita, either psychically, artistically, or socially.<br /><br />Admittedly, Sackville-West, a British aristocrat, was a child of extreme privilege and remained financially comfortable most of her life.<br /><br />However, her managerial skill, expert monetary planning, and her own hard work as an author, radio broadcaster, lecturer, and internationally acclaimed gardener went a long way towards securing that position.<br /><br />'Portrait Of A Marriage' and the story of Sackville-West's life may be the ultimate romantic tale of the twentieth century, though one in which the glamour of wealth, palatial family estates (365-room Knole), creative talent, international fame, and steadfast love were offset by dark episodes of betrayal, spousal abuse, transvestitism, emotional violence, and apparent child abandonment.<br /><br />Remarkably, Vita's story was ultimately a happy one, and the end of her life, relatively serene.<br /><br />Increasingly a loner with age, Sackville-West sequestered herself in her private tower at Sissinghurst, where she continued to write novels and other literature.<br /><br />But men and women continued to fall in love with her and she with them;

US	35944741	R152AMIPC44ZTR	0679750150	483468836	The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea	Books	5	24	24	N	N	Conjuring Up Mythologies	Yukio Mishima's economically composed 'The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea' (1965) is a short, grim novel that gracefully weaves together a number of complex themes and achieves its purpose without hitting a single false or awkward note. Mishima excels at depicting the constant state of tension that results from the disparity between the demands of man's social role and the truth of his inner reality; all of the book's characters struggle with at least these two conflicting elements of their psyches.<br /><br />Ryuji, the sailor of the novel's title, additionally lives part of his life in a very specific dream world of his own careful devising. In this fantasy, or is Ryuji perceiving a genuine layer of a deeper reality?<br /><br />Ryuji believes himself to be an archetypal hero fatally set aside from the rest of mankind but destined for some unimaginable, transcendent future glory.<br /><br />This private mythology and self-idealization provides Ryuji with a kind of charismatic halo which others find mysterious and very attractive, but difficult to specifically identify or even acknowledge.<br /><br />In contrast, Noboru, the young son of Ryuji's widowed fianc&eacute; Fusako, is snared between his docile, school-boy persona and his calculating, brutal, and sociopathic real self.<br /><br />When Ryuji and Noboru meet, the boy perceives the well-muscled sailor as a sterling example of steely, unfettered manhood, while Ryuji sees in Noboru and his mother an opportunity to make his peace with life and a chance to exchange his elitist, perhaps neurotic claims to a higher destiny for something warm and tangible.<br /><br />As they step tentatively towards one another with these ill-defined but inexorable expectations floating between them, each unwittingly places himself on a collision course with calamitous personal disaster.<br /><br />Like Muriel Spark's 'The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie' (1961), 'The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea' masterfully addresses themes of fascism, education, hero worship, betrayal, the enigma of sexual conduct, the inconvenient demands of society, and the painful results that can arise when the mentoring process is miscarried or goes terribly wrong.<br /><br />However, Mishima's cosmos is a much harsher place than the relatively ethical and homey world of the Marsha Blaine School For Girls. Mishima portrays formal Japanese society as one in which the polite, absolutely unassailable dictates of social roles and other artifices provide a fertile breeding ground for crippling human isolation, nihilism, deviance, and just-under-the-skin pathology.<br /><br />Like Erskine Caldwell's 'Journeyman,' 'The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea' also features an important character addictively viewing what he or she believes to be a higher reality through a small hole in a wall. Here, the vision revealed is the primal scene of creation from chaos: Oedipal themes color all of the novel's pages. The book can also be interpreted as a rough parable of Japanese history during the middle decades of the twentieth century.<br /><br />Though 'The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea' manages to maintain its nuanced, balanced, and quietly poetic tone throughout, a protracted but ultimately ungratuitous scene of animal cruelty may repulse some readers.of fascism, education, hero worship, betrayal, the enigma of sexual conduct, the inconvenient demands of society, and the painful results that can arise when the mentoring process is miscarried or goes terribly wrong.<br /><br />However, Mishima's cosmos is a much harsher place than the relatively ethical and homey world of the Marsha Blaine School For Girls.

Spanning the generations, Enright implies, is as easy as extending one's self with honesty, integrity, and faith.<br /><br />Unlike many of today's books written for children, 'Gone Away Lake' is a genuinely warm, spirited, and wholesome book. Framed by ultimately superfluous plot elements such as a mysteriously-carved stone, a pit of quicksand, and a haunted house, 'Gone Away Lake,' a Newberry honorary, will delight readers of all ages.ly as best friends, but as never less than equals in insight, courage, stamina, intelligence, and ingenuity.<br /><br />In the same subtle fashion, Enright underscores the importance of family and human interaction in the life of the individual.

These were relatively optimistic decades in the life of the country, when \\"gusto, vitality...were the values of the young industrial republic already beginning to dominate the world\\" and being a man meant \\"discipline, self-denial, honor, and duty, strength in deeds and not in words.\\"<br /><br />While Capuzzo paints a glorious picture of the idealism, confidence, social manners, and emblematic architecture of the era, he also depicts that world as one strikingly similar to our own: then as now, mankind is at the mercy of random forces, from man's own ignorance, superstition, and greed to sweeping urban diseases, war, and sudden, violent eruptions of nature.<br /><br />Thus Capuzzo's larger theme is the frailty, innocence, and ignorance of mankind in the face of the continuous onslaught of mercenary nature, whose often tranquil face can be insidiously deceptive.<br /><br />The events during the Independence Day holiday of 1916 were loaded with archetypal significance: two young, golden-boy athletes, one a popular figure at the glamorous seaside resort community where he was employed and the other a member of high society, took to the sea on different afternoons for playful, slightly arrogant displays of their prowess as long-distance swimmers.<br /><br />Then, in clear view of promenading guests on the boardwalks of \\"those Edwardian parlors by the sea,\\" they were dismembered and devoured alive by something attacking from beneath the waves.<br /><br />Shortly after, the aberrant man-eater swam inland into Matawan Creek and there, on an idyllic small town summer day, found even younger and more innocence, carefree prey.<br /><br />Capuzzo provides extensive background profiles for the victims and their family members, the rescuers, and scientists that are the book's key players, thus allowing readers to grasp the tragedies in the larger framework of the individual's position in life, ambitions, hopes, and fears.  This clever approach gives 'Close To Shore' its sense of slowly rising power and drama.<br /><br />In a note at the beginning of the book, Capuzzo states that 'Close To Shore' is a work of nonfiction. Though he has scrupulously researched his subject and the history of an entire epoch in all its details, there are no footnotes provided. There are also quite a few occasions in which Capuzzo places thoughts in the heads of the people he is writing about.  While not a work of fiction, the book, as a re-creation of events rather than a strict account of the facts, straddles the line between fiction and nonfiction.<br /><br />Beneath Capuzzo's cool, clean prose, the author is fond of over-generalized (\\"the warming air disturbed the order of nature at all levels\\") or grandiose statements, such as his comment about the great white shark: \\"It is, quite simply, too dangerous for there to be more than a limited number of its kind.\\" Too dangerous for whom, for what?  What science, other than speculative science, supports this claim?<br /><br />Concerning the man-eater of 1916, Capuzzo writes, \\"In all encounters it was governed by a rule born inside it: never start a fight you can't win.\\"  Capuzzo is referring to pure instinct but manages to suggest that the beast has both self-awareness and self-knowledge.<br /><br />Though the great white is only fifty feet away, Capuzzo refers to first victim Charles Vansant, who is accompanied by a seventy-five pound red retriever, as \\"the strongest swimmer in the water.\\"<br /><br />Capuzzo also continuously refersto the shark's behavior in terms of Victor Coppleson's \\"rogue\\" theory  (a chapter is titled \\"A Long-Range Cruising Rogue,\\" and elsewhere Capuzzo writes \\"the big fish that entered Matawan Creek was profoundly disturbed before it became trapped, already on a rare and fragile edge of violence, even for its species\\"), but later states, without further comment, \\"by the twenty-first century, Coppleson's theory [of rogue sharks] was widely dismissed by scientists.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Under A Full Moon,\\" Capuzzo writes, \\"nor would anyone have understood the pull of the hidden [waxing] moon like a trigger on the jaws of the shark.\\" Although the short chapter is wholly dedicated to moon mythology, nothing explains the passage above.  Capuzzo refers to \\"water\\" inexplicably as \\"the first human home.\\" Is he referring to early life in the womb or the primordial ooze?<br /><br />Capuzzo is correct that the \\"huge manta rays\\" and \\"eight-hundred pound ocean sunfish\\" seen or caught off the Jersey coast are not \\"sea monsters\\" in the mythical sense. However, in terms of size, these creatures, along with some scientist's hypothesized \\"twenty-five or thirty foot\\" great white sharks and other ocean giants, certainly are sea monsters in the literal sense, which is close enough for most people. A sixty-foot giant squid can just as accurately be called a sea monster as an \\"enormous cephalopod\\" or any other designation given it by man.<br /><br />Mythical or natural, the effect of these creatures on man's sense of reality and imagination is the same.<br /><br />Overall, 'Close To Shore' is a fascinating, crisply written, and intelligent book which smoothly evokes the period it describes.<br /><br />By alternating chapters between the shark's underwater journey and the lives of the victims to be, Capuzzo is very successful in creating a mesmerizing effect, making the book a pleasurable and educational page-turner.<br /><br />Readers may also want to seek out Richard Fernicola's '12 Days of Terror' (2001), which addresses the same subject.to the shark's behavior in terms of Victor Coppleson's \\"rogue\\" theory  (a chapter is titled \\"A Long-Range Cruising Rogue,\\" and elsewhere Capuzzo writes \\"the big fish that entered Matawan Creek was profoundly disturbed before it became trapped, already on a rare and fragile edge of violence, even for its species\\"), but later states, without further comment, \\"by the twenty-first century, Coppleson's theory [of rogue sharks] was widely dismissed by scientists.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Under A Full Moon,\\" Capuzzo writes, \\"nor would anyone have understood the pull of the hidden [waxing] moon like a trigger on the jaws of the shark.\\" Although the short chapter is wholly dedicated to moon mythology, nothing explains the passage above.

Written in an uneven, semi-comic, and baroque style, the book is more likely to impress young readers rather than older and more experienced individuals who have lost their appetite for decadent romantic entanglements.<br /><br />'Nightwood' is certainly an original work, and Barnes' vision of the factors shaping human destiny--especially time, heritage, and evolution--are uniquely expressed.  But despite its fluidity of language, many of Barnes' seemingly brilliant observations concerning life, consciousness, and human suffering are more specious than acute, which is important, since Barnes' emotionally marooned cast is badly in need of answers, wisdom, and salvation.<br /><br />Hiding under the text's antique lathering is a sparse, skeletal plot, one top heavy with philosophical speculations but reflecting little grasp of basic psychological truths about human nature.<br /><br />Nora Flood meets and falls destructively in love with passive-aggressive Robin Vote, a strange, corpse-eyed, and inexplicably charismatic woman who, despite marriage and motherhood, is spiritually, psychologically, and emotionally adrift in the world. When their affair evolves into a love triangle, Nora turns increasingly for advice to charlatan doctor and Greek chorus Matthew O'Connor, a poverty-stricken alcoholic who is pleasurably inclined towards homosexuality, transvestitism, and self-demoralization (\\"I'm a lady in no need of insults,\\" \\"I was born as ugly as God dare premeditate\\"). Significantly, all of the book's characters are in some way stunted, crippled, or pathologically predisposed.<br /><br />Barnes excels at dramatizing the failure of romantic love, especially the kind that displays active neurotic factors, elements of codependence, and spontaneous psychological transference.  Those pages which detail Nora's isolation and sad obsession with her abandoning lover are deeply felt, haunting, and moving indeed.<br /><br />In \\"The Squatter,\\" Barnes spends an entire chapter fulfilling a personal vendetta by brilliantly depicting widow Jenny Petherbridge's status as a rapacious black hole and non-entity. Jenny is ugly (\\"she had a beaked head and the body, small, feeble, and ferocious, that somehow made one associate her with Judy,\\" \\"only severed could any part of her been called \\"right\\"), stupid (\\"when anyone was witty about a contemporary event, she would look perplexed and a little dismayed\\"), incapable of establishing her own values (\\"Someone else's wedding ring was on her finger...the books in her library were other people's selections...her walls, her cupboards, her bureaux, were teeming with second-hand dealings with life...the words that fell from her mouth seemed to have been lent to her\\"), spiritually empty but power hungry (\\"she wanted to be the reason for everything and so was the cause of nothing\\"), and lacks poise, maturity, and dignity (\\"being one of those panicky little women, who, no matter what they put on, look like a child under penance,\\" or, as O'Connor calls her, \\"a decaying comedy jester, the face on a fool's- stick, and with the smell about her of mouse-nests\\"). Barnes makes an excellent case for the argument that it is not the powerful that are to be feared, but the weak, frustrated, and incapable.<br /><br />Robin the \\"somnambulist\\" is also lengthily described, largely via the use of symbols and metaphors: throughout the text, the boyish, bird-named Robin is described in animal, vegetable, and mineral terms.  When first encountered, Robin, who is later recognized as a kindred spirit by a wild circus animal and a ferocious dog, is found lying unconscious in a small apartment crowded with a superabundance of plant life.  Barnes describes Robin's abode as \\"a jungle trapped in a drawing room\\" and Robin as the \\"ration of the carnivorous flowers.\\"<br /><br />The flamboyant, rhetoric-spewing Dr. Matthew O'Connor,the book's most famous character, is a figure of high camp whom today's readers are more likely to find mildly distasteful rather than shocking.<br /><br />O'Connor is given an entire long chapter in which to pontificate (\\"Watchman, What Of The Night?\\"), though the chapter reflects badly on the wounded Nora, whose continuous exclamations of \\"but what am I to do?,\\" \\"what will become of her?\\" and \\"wow will I stand it?\\" reduce her from the genuinely tormented human being of earlier chapters to a one-dimensional cartoon damsel in distress.<br /><br />Intelligent, perceptive readers are likely to find one passage in every five that sounds profound and poetically illuminating like the others, but means absolutely nothing on careful examination (for example: \\"Your body is coming to it, your are forty and the body has a politic too, and a life of its own that you like to think is yours. I heard a spirit new once, but I knew it was a mystery eternally moving outward and on, and not my own.\\")<br /><br />Despite Barnes' often incredible use of language, the ultimate effect of 'Nightwood' is one of shallowness, slickness, and almost hysterical distance from its own primary sources.<br /><br />When compared to other literary books written by women also primarily focused on women, such as the five novels of Jean Rhys or Muriel Spark's 'The Driver's Seat,' 'Nightwood' seems sketchy, brittle, and, as one critic said about Isak Dinesen's 'Seven Gothic Tales,' seemingly more concerned with mystification than with genuine mystery.<br /><br />Though bold and intrepid as a beautiful young big city journalist, and later as an expatriate modernist writer living among the Parisian glitterati, Barnes closed the door on the rest of the world in very early middle age, and became a notorious New York City recluse known primarily for bitterness and explosive outbursts of anger.<br /><br />Readers of 'Nightwood,' with its essential focus on theoretical, airy philosophy rather than psychological home truths, may find clues as to how Barnes's life went sorrowfully wrong.the book's most famous character, is a figure of high camp whom today's readers are more likely to find mildly distasteful rather than shocking.<br /><br />O'Connor is given an entire long chapter in which to pontificate (\\"Watchman, What Of The Night?\\"), though the chapter reflects badly on the wounded Nora, whose continuous exclamations of \\"but what am I to do?,\\" \\"what will become of her?\\" and \\"wow will I stand it?\\" reduce her from the genuinely tormented human being of earlier chapters to a one-dimensional cartoon damsel in distress.<br /><br />Intelligent, perceptive readers are likely to find one passage in every five that sounds profound and poetically illuminating like the others, but means absolutely nothing on careful examination (for example: \\"Your body is coming to it, your are forty and the body has a politic too, and a life of its own that you like to think is yours.

Daniel Pinchbeck's 'Breaking Open the Head: a Psychedelic Journey into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism' makes an earnest attempt to persuade its audience that a variety of natural hallucinogens provide users with a genuine glimpse into the vital world of spirits. Unfortunately, the key question this position raises--whether the 'other-worldly journeys' experienced are merely hallucinations brought on by the ingested substances--hangs pendulously over the book like a perilously suspended lead brick. Pinchbeck clearly means well, but 'Breaking Open the Head' is amateurish and misguided at almost every turn.<br /><br />Readers will find that 'Breaking Open the Head' resembles nothing so much as the weighty tome that persistently haunts editor Nancy Hawkins in Muriel Spark's 'A Far Cry From Kensington' (1988): \\"On every page, Nietzsche, Aristotle, Goethe, Ibsen, Freud, Jung, Huxley, Kierkegaard, and no grasp whatsoever of any of them.\\"<br /><br />Likewise, Pinchbeck uses excerpts from the work of respectable authors Carl Jung, Mircea Eliade, Carlo Ginsburg, and Claude Levi-Strauss, but readers would be wiser consulting the original texts than quietly mulling through the mish-mash of their ideas presented here.<br /><br />Elsewhere, ''Breaking Open the Head' is an undizzying brew of Artaud, Aleister Crowley, Thomas Pynchon, William Burroughs, Hunter S. Thompson, Allen Ginsberg, Terence McKenna, Ken Kesey, and the discredited Carlos Castaneda. Even Dion Fortune gets a mention in the bibliography, which also lists Jeremy Narby's valueless 'Shamans Through Time' as a source. Elsewhere, Pinchbeck refers to W. Y. Evans-Wentz's 'The Fairy Faith In Celtic Countries' rather than to the far superior (but academically less esteemed) 'Visions and Beliefs in the West of Ireland' by Lady Gregory and William Butler Yeats.<br /><br />Things start off badly in the introduction when Pinchbeck reveals that one of his greatest inspirations is Walter Benjamin, a writer who spent his life overstating and complicating the obvious and more often than not simply embracing thin air.<br /><br />Pinchbeck, who is smart enough to reject Lacan, quotes Benjamin's comments on the Surrealists: \\"In the world's structure, dream loosens individuality like a bad tooth. This loosening of the self by intoxication is, at the same time, precisely the fruitful, living experience that allowed these people to step outside the domain of intoxication.\\"<br /><br />Pinchbeck interprets this to mean \\"altered states allowed thinkers to escape, temporarily, from the overwhelming, and intoxicating, dreamworld of capitalism.\\"<br /><br />One chapter is titled \\"Great Robot Empires,\\" but its second paragraph begins \\"When I returned to New York a few days later, I checked my email,\\" suggesting that Pinchbeck is grossly unaware of how comfortably and thoroughly a utilizer of the great capitalist robot empire he is himself.<br /><br />Pinchbeck has a weakness for pretentious thinkers, including Jean-Francois Lyotard--\\"Being prepared to receive what thought is not prepared to think is what deserves the name of thinking.\\"<br /><br />Apparently this tendency for embracing unnecessarily convoluted if not meaningless texts runs in Pinchbeck's family, as the reader is told that the author's tormented father, a failed abstract expressionist painter, \\"read constantly\\" of \\"Blanchot, Derrida, Wittgenstein, Nietzsche.\\" Sadly, picking up a Zane Grey or P. G. Wodehouse apparently never occurred to him.<br /><br />Pinchbeck's trials and tribulations while under the influence of a variety of hallucinogens in both familiar and isolated parts of the world are often unintentionally hilarious, even as they suggest a fatally careless tendency in his nature.<br /><br />During one session in the East Village \\"organized by a couple from California,\\" the author and several others ingest yage after being provided with \\"Adult Depends diapers\\" and \\"plastic buckets for vomiting.\\" In fact, so many people vomit in'Breaking Open the Head' that readers will expect to find 'Vomiting' listed in the index.<br /><br />In another encounter, Pinchbeck travels to Gabon without first practicing due diligence, and has just the kind of experience any mature adult would expect when putting one's life completely, naively, and foolishly in the hands of unknown citizens of a strange culture. Pinchbeck is clearly familiar the work of Paul Bowles, but nonetheless places himself in exactly the sort of position that Bowles' luckless, doomed protagonists find themselves in in tale after tale and novel after novel.<br /><br />'Breaking Open the Head' finds its author uncomfortably growing up in public; small but potent signs of deep insecurity, narcissism, and repressed hysteria (see his use of the word 'very' below) abound.<br /><br />Pinchbeck spends two paragraphs recounting the suffering that his \\"preposterous last name\\" and \\"spurious moniker\\" (pinchbeck means \\"false gold\\") has brought him, forgetting that \\"pinchbeck\\" is not exactly a word in common usage, and certainly not \\"goldbrick\\" in any case.<br /><br />The author's style also betrays itself, as Pinchbeck is fond of sentences like \\"it sounded like she was vomiting out her very being\\" and \\"the short-term greed and monotonous moral blindness -- increasingly threaten the very fabric of our being.\\"<br /><br />Something of a grandchild of the Beat Generation (his mother was an important figure in the life of Jack Kerouac), readers might expect Pinchbeck would downplay (if mention at all) this unsubtle fact in the greater interest of his reputation, but he does not.<br /><br />In 'Daimonic Reality: Understanding Otherworld Encounters' (1994), Patrick Harpur succeeded at creating a lucid, intelligent, and deeply felt book not unlike what Pinchbeck has attempted here. Harpur also continually referred to Jung, Yeats, Blake, and others, and built his arguments thoroughly and soundly around the work and the experiences of these distinguished visionaries. In addition, Harpur had a cornucopia of original ideas of his own and brilliant talent for assimilating diverse threads of Western culture.<br /><br />Pinchbeck, unfortunately, merely jumps from specious \\"dialectic\\" to specious \\"dialectic,\\" propping up his text with passages taken from other authors that he believes support his very slight, watery theses.<br /><br />The final impression 'Breaking Open the Head' makes is not one of heightened insight or wisdom, but of short sightedness, tunnel-vision, and its author's own acute lack of perception concerning the world around him and what may or may not constitute the nature of reality.'Breaking Open the Head' that readers will expect to find 'Vomiting' listed in the index.<br /><br />In another encounter, Pinchbeck travels to Gabon without first practicing due diligence, and has just the kind of experience any mature adult would expect when putting one's life completely, naively, and foolishly in the hands of unknown citizens of a strange culture.

Ruth Plumly Thompson's 'The Hungry Tiger Of Oz' (1926), though less than fully developed, is nonetheless an enjoyable fantasy novel. The book addresses the Hungry Tiger's unresolved conflict between his enormous appetite and his moral conscience head on (to kill and eat, or not to kill and eat?), and introduces a new character, Carter Green the Vegetable Man, who is distinctive, colorful, and so full of lively potential that readers will find themselves wishing the title of the book was 'The Vegetable Man Of Oz' instead.<br /><br />Once a young Winkie produce salesman, Carter has eaten so many of his own vegetables that he has lost his human appearance altogether and has come to resemble one of Acrimboldo's autumnal noblemen, to whom he is first cousin.<br /><br />The creation of Carter was probably influenced by the vegetable men and women harvest effigies common at Halloween in still-agrarian America during the first 25 years of the 20th century; Carter has an enormous beet for a head, celery greens hair, a turnip nose, a potato-like body, and corn, of course, for ears.<br /><br />Like the Wooglebug, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Patchwork Girl, and the Frogman before him, the Vertimus-like Carter is so inspired a character that his appearance in Oz feels almost like an inevitability.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Thompson fails to introduce him to Oz's other two agricultural demi-gods, the Scarecrow and Jack Pumpkinhead (to say nothing of roadside tramp the Shaggy Man, Oz's greatest advocate for the country way of life), for the three could have had interesting adventures and conversations together indeed. Besides being intelligent, and accepting of his transformation, Carter is also tender hearted, humble, courageous, and obsessed with selling produce at almost any cost (threatened with painful execution, Carter tells Betsy and the Hungry Tiger, \\"It wouldn't hurt me, for I have no feelings, but it will ruin my business.\\").<br /><br />As in too many of her Oz titles, Thompson opens the book with a boy hero, Prince Evered, in trouble within his own kingdom; when not being threatened with unattractive marriages, Thompson's boy kings and princes have usually been toppled from their thrones and hidden away in dark dungeons by wicked adult conspirators.<br /><br />As a result, the first third of 'The Hungry Tiger Of Oz' feels like deja vu all over again. The narrative only gains momentum once Evered, the Hungry Tiger, Carter, and veteran Oz child Betsy Bobbin travel beyond the Arabia-like Kingdom of Rash, which stands between the Deadly Desert and endless stretches of dry, rocky (i. e., boring, unimaginative) terrain. Towards the middle of the narrative, the story begins moving in other directions, as fairy ruler Ozma joins the cast and action.<br /><br />The generally crotchety, difficult-to-please Hungry Tiger eventually learns how to resolve his natural drives vs. ethics conflict, but not before suffering a series of humiliating, ego-crushing experiences.<br /><br />Thompson answers William Blake's immortal question (\\"What immortal hand or eye / Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\\") in her own sly way in a manner that will delight readers.<br /><br />Throughout, 'The Hungry Tiger Of Oz' feels rushed, sketchy, and narrow in scope, as if Thompson had thrown less than the full weight of her talent into its writing.<br /><br />Nothing underscores this more than the scenes in which the threatened Ozma states that she is helpless without her magic belt, which she has left behind in the Emerald City.<br /><br />As Oz enthusiasts know, Ozma's powers are inherent and numerous; the magic belt is only one physical tool among many typically available to her.<br /><br />All the Royal Historians liked to rewrite the laws, rules, and regulations of Oz from time to time, but readers may come away with the impression that 'The Hungry Tiger Of Oz' was written quickly and with a minimum of imagination.<br /><br />Further watering the soup, John R. Neill's essential, full-page illustrations have been left out of this edition, which includes only Neill's incidental pictures.sential, full-page illustrations have been left out of this edition, which includes only Neill's incidental pictures.	2003-03-17

Frank Baum's 'The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz,' the Oz chronicle is alive, healthy, and better than ever.<br /><br />Edward Einhorn's 'Paradox In Oz' (1999) is an intricate, fun, and respectful tribute to previous Royal Historians Baum, Ruth Plumly Thompson, and author/artist John R. Neill.<br /><br />Einhorn and illustrator Eric Shanower, who is also an editor, author, and the publisher of Hungry Tiger Press, have created the most intellectual of Oz books, though the story, which is a puzzle, can be readily understood by readers of all ages and backgrounds.<br /><br />Appropriately, 'Paradox In Oz' is concerned with time and time travel; the novel addresses the physical laws of Baum's fairyland, which alter slightly from book to book and author to author.<br /><br />Longtime fans of the series know the inhabitants of Oz do not age, and time, while it does not stand still, seems to exist in only in terms of infinity, making the fairy kingdom not unlike the Christian concept of heaven.<br /><br />'Paradox In Oz' tackles these concepts head on: as the book opens, Munchkin, Winkie, Quadling, and Gillikin citizens of all walks of life, including several members of the Emerald City's royal family, have discovered that they have suddenly begun to age.<br /><br />Perceptive readers will be delighted to find that, unlike in most of the previous titles in the series in which the physics of Oz lay comfortably and unquestioningly in the background, Einhorn reveals that fairy ruler Ozma and sorceress supreme Glinda the Good have little if any idea of how the spell of timelessness originated.<br /><br />Forced into immediate action, Ozma, who is no longer a preening little girl, discovers the existence of a strange, magical animal named Tempus, who is, of course, a hybrid of a parrot and an ox. Tempus, though a living creature, is also the manifestation of a time-bending mathematical equation realized after endless difficulty by the anxious, continually harried Dr. Majestico.<br /><br />In classic science-fiction fashion, Ozma mounts Tempus and naively sets off into the past in search of The Man Who Lives Backwards, thus precipitating a series of chronal disasters and finding herself lost in a cosmos of alternate Oz fairylands, one of which is a grim, hellish Oz ruled by evil doppelgangers of the Oz royal family.<br /><br />Throughout, the plot is incredibly crisp, bright, and stimulating, making 'Paradox In Oz' perhaps the greatest page-turner of all the novels in the series. The narrative moves backward, down, sidewise, up, and forward, but never loses its thread, and there are absolutely no superfluous chapters or incidental characters.<br /><br />Ozma's complications never become the reader's, for Einhorn's Ozma is a cautious, reflective, intelligent, and emotionally mature young lady who continually practices common sense (often to her detriment here) and independence of spirit.<br /><br />Longtime readers devoted to the witch population of Oz will be happy to find classic villain and crone Mombi, in both good and evil forms, an essential part of the narrative.<br /><br />Throughout, Shanower's excellent illustrations suit the mood and tone of text perfectly, and are so satisfying that readers will not find themselves longing for, or even thinking of, the late, great John R. Neill.<br /><br />'Paradox In Oz' belongs high on a perch with the other great Oz classics.ous, continually harried Dr. Majestico.<br /><br />In classic science-fiction fashion, Ozma mounts Tempus and naively sets off into the past in search of The Man Who Lives Backwards, thus precipitating a series of chronal disasters and finding herself lost in a cosmos of alternate Oz fairylands, one of which is a grim, hellish Oz ruled by evil doppelgangers of the Oz royal family.<br /><br />Throughout, the plot is incredibly crisp, bright, and stimulating, making 'Paradox In Oz' perhaps the greatest page-turner of all the novels in the series.

With Ozma temporarily away from the Emerald City, the group, accompanied by newly matured maid-in-waiting Jellia Jamb ('Jelly and Jam') and the Soldier With The Green Whiskers, take to the skies adventuring.<br /><br />After several weak and disposable titles, Thompson's 'Ozoplaning With The Wizard Of Oz' has the distinction of being the fastest moving and most economic novel in the entire Oz chronicle.<br /><br />There is no superfluous padding whatsoever, and, looking ahead to illustrator John R. Neill's 'The Wonder City In Oz' (1940), the novel has a loose, kooky, post-Romantic tone which perfectly suits Baum's utopist fairyland.<br /><br />No longer a 'sweet, darling little maid' perennially restricted to the background, Jellia Jamb is modern young lady--not a little girl--with a feisty, determined spirit and a bright mind.<br /><br />Happily, it is Jellia, and not Dorothy (who, in defiance of the laws of the kingdom, also seems to have matured considerably), who is the book's protagonist.<br /><br />Thompson also allows the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to stand center stage, utterly freeing the characters from the dreary limitations Baum often saddled them with in his later titles.<br /><br />Never has the Tin Woodman been this lively, decisive, vigorous, and comical. Thompson's characterization of the Cowardly Lion was the most realized of any of the Oz writers, a talent again demonstrated here. Thankfully, none of the lead characters are transformed into beasts, no overly-sweet or obnoxious sidekick animals are introduced, and no one speaks in broken baby talk.<br /><br />Though the narrative eventually falls back on the overused idea of the Emerald City being invaded by outside forces, the writing throughout is so rollicking and enthusiastic that the inevitable invasion seems almost fresh.<br /><br />In an unusual touch, Thompson has the only briefly seen Trot, Betsy, Tik-Tok, and the Patchwork Girl fleeing the invasion rather than heroically standing their ground.<br /><br />In another refreshing twist, aggressive flying King Strut of The Strat decides to attack the Emerald City only after the Tin Woodman declares Strut's sky kingdom a new colony of Oz. Deeply offended when told that he and his people are now subjects of Ozma, Strut reasonably feels that it is his kingdom that has been invaded, and decides to take the offensive.<br /><br />'Ozoplaning With The Wizard Of Oz' is one of the classic entries in the series, touching as it does on both established Oz history as well as Oz history to come.<br /><br />At the fireside party in the opening chapters, early Oz history is thoroughly and joyfully recounted by the attendees.<br /><br />Thompson's Jellia Jamb will remind readers of a kinder, less boisterous Jenny Jump, and the Wizard's cat-like &#34;kit bag&#34; of magic may have been the inspiration for Jenny Jump's &#34;handbag of fairy gifts.&#34; For reasons unknown, Thompson changes the true name of the Soldier With The Green Whiskers from the established Omby Amby to Wantowin Battles ('Want To Win Battles'), but, regardless, the Soldier, who is far more of a coward than the Lion, adds excellent comic relief to the story.<br /><br />Regarding Oz mythology, with its occasionally shifting laws, rules and regulations, Jellia states early in the novel, &#34;If I live to be a million, I'll never forget the day she (Dorothy) came to the castle with the Cowardly Lion, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman. Not if I live to be a million!&#34;<br /><br />As Oz scholars know, Oz is not only a non-earthly paradise but also an approximation of the Christian concept of the afterlife.<br /><br />Presuming she is genuinely alive in the earthly sense of the word, Jellia will live to be a million, and, in fact, will live forever, since no one dies in Oz and only the unlucky or unfavored--like the Wicked Witch of the West--can be destroyed.<br /><br />Not only does the opening chapter take the unusual step of informing the reader that it is autumn in Oz (one of the airships has been christened &#34;the Oztober&#34;), but, at the book's end, Dorothy mentions Halloween. Unfortunately the highly potent idea of celebrating Halloween in Oz is explored no further.<br /><br />Reflecting the book's light, fun tone, John R.

The original 1928 Arthur Rackham edition of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' (1819) was one of the most beautifully-illustrated versions of the tale ever produced. The Books Of Wonder facsimile of that edition is certainly the finest available today, though folk artist Will Moses' bright retelling runs a close second.<br /><br />Rackham's watercolors for this American classic are very much in keeping with his earlier work, which had established him as the greatest British illustrator of his era.<br /><br />Where much of Irving's tale is painted in the warm autumn hues, Rackham choose to portray Sleep Hollow as not only a place of overwhelming haunts and visions, but as a region existing in a state of permanent, moody twilight. His Sleepy Hollow seems perpetually in crepuscular shadow: the last pure rays of the sun have just vanished from the earth, and darkness, though it has not fallen yet, is falling quickly. In the artist's eye, Irving's fireside tale appears to take place not in glorious mid-October, but in storm-swept late November. The illustrator's anthropomorphic and archetypal Sleepy Hollow also magnifies elements of Irving's romantic landscape over and above the necessities of the text.<br /><br />While witches, ghosts and &#34;visions in the air&#34; are discussed in the story, Rackham depicts the trees, houses, and countryside of the region as teeming with every kind of fairy, goblin, dryad, and witch, as if calmly revealing to the eyes of man the always-coexistent, if invisible, supernatural life of the Hudson River Valley.<br /><br />His painting of Major Andre's Tree, for example, depicts a traditional European fairytale witch and her black cat familiar walking along the road beneath Andre's tree as if they had every right to be there. It is mankind that is the anxious, insecure, and mortally temporary interloper into this vaster mystical world. Rackham's trees are trees but also fairies, his fairies are fairies but also witches, his witches are human in form but also trees, and the birds resting in the trees, while birds, are sometimes partially fairies.<br /><br />All of these creatures confidently, humorously, and mischievously observe mankind, which, when not perpetually scurrying home to safety, gathers together in nervous groups to share tidings, portents, and spook tales.<br /><br />Irving's remarkably poetic prose is in every way worthy of the man who bears the honor of being America's first great writer. Interestingly, the tale is partially a study in contrasts: schoolteacher Ichabod Crane and his rival, the rabble-rousing Brom Bones, though obvious opposites, each also contain elements of the other. Ichabod, though he lives largely in his thoughts and dreams, has a very definite physical side: he plays boisterously outdoors with the town children, and, at the fatal party at the story's end, commands the dance floor in a way that delights and astonishes the other guests.<br /><br />And Brom, who is a great horseman and a fearless fighter, is also known throughout the region for his cleverness in shrewdly achieving his own ends.<br /><br />Ichabod is an ugly, eccentric &#34;scarecrow&#34; of a man, while Brom is &#34;broad-shouldered and double-jointed,&#34; with a &#34;Herculean frame and great powers of limb.&#34; Brom, unlike the ultimately solitary Ichabod, is a well-established alpha male with &#34;three or four boon companions who regard him as their model,&#34; and who comprise his &#34;gang.&#34; On the other hand, Ichabod, when not surrounded by his boy students, spends his time gossiping and sharing ghost stories around midnight fires with elderly Dutch women.<br /><br />Ichabod and Brom both court the lovely Katrina Van Tassel in their own fashion, not only because she is a model of feminine beauty and charm, but because each covets her family's wealth and bountiful farmland.<br /><br />It is no accident that the &#34;dominant&#34; specter of Sleepy Hollow, who is &#34;commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air,&#34; is a headless horseman, while Ichabod is a respected teacher and storyteller, a &#34;man of letters&#34; and a &#34;pedagogue.&#34; The fearsome, massively-built Headless Horseman, who may or may not be Brom in disguise, is all torso and limbs, while Ichabod is one of the few, if not the only, inhabitant of the hollow who earns his living by his intellect--by his head. Thus they make symbolically perfect, if unequal, opponents.<br /><br />With his real or illusory ties to the supernatural, the headless horseman, who is believed to ride the wind and to appear and disappear in bursts of fire, is a malevolent force of nature. If of supernatural origin, then he does indeed command &#34;the nightmare, with her whole ninefold,&#34; and all the other spirits of the air; but if merely human, then he still commands Brom's raw, &#34;Herculean&#34; power, and is physically far more than a match for Ichabod.<br /><br />Clearly, Irving was making a statement of sorts. Brom's earthy cleverness and steely masculinity triumph in the end, while Ichabod's misapplied intelligence, more often than not, leads him towards, and not away from, superstition, anxiety, and hysteria-ridden imagining. Brom's quiet confidence in his prowess is genuine, but the talkative Ichabod's confidence is only a smug self-deception out of which his boastfulness and foolish behavior are born.<br /><br />This edition is a happy marriage of two masters of their form, and contains the unabridged text.<br /><br />Travelers may be particularly interested in the Rackham watercolor captioned &#34;Reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones,&#34; which portrays Ichabod and three Dutch maidens standing in the Old Dutch Churchyard on an overcast afternoon. The illustration is remarkable, because, 75 years after it was completed, those visiting the churchyard today, which is now a national landmark, can stand in exactly the same spot and see how incredibly accurate the artist's representation of the burial ground was, and how little the beautiful site has changed, in mood and detail, over the years.<br /><br />As Irving wrote, &#34;Time, which changes all things, is slow in its operations on a Dutchman's dwelling.&#34; And thereabouts.respected teacher and storyteller, a &#34;man of letters&#34; and a &#34;pedagogue.&#34; The fearsome, massively-built Headless Horseman, who may or may not be Brom in disguise, is all torso and limbs, while Ichabod is one of the few, if not the only, inhabitant of the hollow who earns his living by his intellect--by his head.

Frank Baum's 'The Scarecrow Of Oz' (1915) is very likely his greatest Oz novel, as its story is warmly and enthusiastically told, moves forward superbly, and the only padding found within its pages is the straw that stuffs the Scarecrow's body.<br /><br />Baum wanted to transfer characters Trot (real name: Mayre Griffith) and her much older guardian, Captain Bill, of his non-Oz titles 'The Sea Fairies' (1911) and 'Sky Island' (1912), into Oz permanently, and they are the apparent stars of the book until the Scarecrow is introduced on its 173rd page.<br /><br />Though Trot, like Betsy Bobbin before her, is almost identical to Dorothy Gale in manner and appearance and would in later volumes largely fade into a pale replica of her, Baum here allows Trot to command the narrative and display a number of admirable, heartening qualities.<br /><br />Perennial lost boy Button-Bright (real name: Saladin Paracelsus de Lambertine Evagne von Smith), who is discovered buried face down in a small mountain of popped corn, is also a key player.<br /><br />Caught in a monstrous whirlpool that appears out of nowhere while sailing on calm American ocean waters, Trot and Captain Bill awaken in a strangely lit underwater grotto.  Though the narrow, claustrophobically confining passage they are obligated to enter and follow does not lead them directly to Oz, it does lead them to another of Baum's fairytale kingdoms.<br /><br />As in previous titles, readers may question whether Trot and Captain Bill have died and passed into the afterlife; certainly their early travails have a purgatory-like quality.<br /><br />In a hilarious episode, the twosome find themselves trapped on a small, lush island with the most cantankerous man living, who complains that the trees are too green, the water \\"dreadfully wet,\\" and that the sun, which unpleasantly \\"shines in the daytime,\\" is useless, because \\"it disappears just as soon as it begins to get dark.\\"  This \\"little old man of the island\\" is in exile, and certainly seems to occupy his own tiny circle in hell.<br /><br />As in 'Sky Island,' readers are given excellent expository information about Button-Bright; this is important, because Button-Bright, when appearing later in the Oz chronicle, was often portrayed as an annoying idiot with a tabula rasa for a mind (\\"Some folks think I'm stupid. I guess I am,\\" he goes so far to say in 'Sky Island').<br /><br />However, in 'The Scarecrow Of Oz,' Baum explains Button-Bright to his audience in almost Zen-like terms. Button-Bright is \\"almost as destitute of nerves as the Scarecrow...nothing ever astonished him much; nothing ever worried him or made him unhappy. Good fortune or bad fortune he accepted with a quiet smile, never complaining, whatever happened.\\"<br /><br />Is Button-Bright a young wandering Buddha?<br /><br />Button-Bright, who has an exceptionally hardy appetite, is enthralled by both the beauties of nature and of happenstance. A junior lord of unforeseen contingency, an open meadow, a hedge of berry bushes, or a fluttering butterfly is all that is necessary to send him dashing off blissfully into spatial oblivion.  In 'The Scarecrow Of Oz,' Button-Bright, who lives purely in the moment, seems to possess the secret of happiness, if no longer his magical umbrella, and makes a perfect counterpoint to the more responsible, rational Trot.<br /><br />'The Scarecrow Of Oz' is also one of the several Baum-composed Oz titles that concerns itself with witches.<br /><br />One of the book's three main antagonists, Blinkie, who, like the Wicked Witch in the first book, has but a single good eye, is a traditional European folklore witch: she is old, wrinkled, eccentric, power hungry, toadying, and spiteful.<br /><br />Interestingly, as in medieval drawings, Blinkie and her fellow witches ride their broomsticks with the brush portion forward.<br /><br />Baumeven raises the possibility of witch burning, though, as bad luck may have it, it is the easily consumed Scarecrow and not Blinkie that is eventually tied to a stake and threatened with fire.<br /><br />Baum counters Blinkie with Gibson Girl look-alike sorceress Glinda the Good, who, the opposite of the witch in every way, is lovingly described: \\"No one knows her age, but all can see who beautiful and stately she is...her hair is like red gold and finer than the finest silken strands. Her eyes are blue as the sky and always frank and smiling. Her cheeks are the envy of peach-blows and her mouth is enticing as a rosebud. Glinda is tall and wears splendid gowns that trail behind her as she walks. She wears no jewels, for her beauty would shame them.\\"<br /><br />Strangely enough, illustrator John R. Neill consistently portrays Baum's sorceress supreme wearing an unusual headdress conspicuously crowned with what looks like a cross between a healthy, long-stemmed, large-capped mushroom and a vigorous phallus.<br /><br />Here more than in any of other Oz title, the Scarecrow shines, as he rightly should, though the novel is more than half over before he makes his appearance.<br /><br />Baum tended to dilute even his most popular characters over the course of the series, and in too many Baum titles the Scarecrow is depicted as little more than the Tin Woodman's \\"heterosexual life partner,\\" though of course the Scarecrow bills and coos with the Patchwork Girl as well as with best friend Nick Chopper.<br /><br />The Scarecrow, sent by Glinda to rescue Trot and her cohorts from an evil king, is certainly the hero of the book: \\"As a conqueror I'm a wonder,\\" he says before single-handedly but futilely demanding that King Krewl abdicate his ill-gotten throne.  Happily, the sometimes Christ-like Scarecrow survives both burning at the stake and drowning in a waterfall, but not without the help of less overconfident friends.<br /><br />Gorgeously illustrated in both color and black and white, 'The Scarecrow Of Oz' is excellent in every way and belongs at the very top of the multi-volume Oz heap.even raises the possibility of witch burning, though, as bad luck may have it, it is the easily consumed Scarecrow and not Blinkie that is eventually tied to a stake and threatened with fire.<br /><br />Baum counters Blinkie with Gibson Girl look-alike sorceress Glinda the Good, who, the opposite of the witch in every way, is lovingly described: \\"No one knows her age, but all can see who beautiful and stately she is...her hair is like red gold and finer than the finest silken strands.

Frank Baum set out to write and produce a second Oz musical for the stage, he discovered he had signed away the theatrical rights to his early Oz stories and characters.<br /><br />Apparently unwilling to create new material, Baum drafted a play that he called 'Tik-Tok Of Oz,' which was simply a retelling of his third Oz novel, 1907's 'Ozma Of Oz,' with some character names changed and minor plot elements rearranged.  Since he owed publishers Reilly & Britton a new Oz book, Baum then rewrote his new play into a novel, and 1914's redundant 'Tik-Tok Of Oz' was born.<br /><br />With such a circuitous pedigree, it's no wonder that 'Tik-Tok Of Oz' is a generally unimpressive entry into the Oz chronicle.<br /><br />Baum was occasionally careless with his prestigious fairyland, and nothing suggests that here more than the fact that wind-up mechanical man Tik-Tok, though his name lights up the book's title, is only a secondary character in the narrative and often appears to be absent from much of the story, even when present in theory.<br /><br />In fact, the Tin Woodman or Jack Pumpkinhead could have replaced the clockwork man without altering the essential plot in the least.<br /><br />But the uncomplicated Tik-Tok was particularly useful in a lazily composed narrative, since, as a preprogrammed machine of limited potential in need of continuous winding, Baum could silence him at any time by simply having him run down, no dramatic action or mental fatigue required. Despite several warm and imaginatively written chapters, such as 'The Lovely Lady Of Light,' the book plods on without building in strength or imagination until its final section, when it suddenly awakens to life.<br /><br />Dorothy Gale doppelganger Betsy Bobbin, accompanied by sidekick Hank the Mule, reaches the shores of fairyland when a ship on which she is inexplicably a passenger explodes at sea.<br /><br />Baum's ho-hum attitude towards his material is immediately evident when introducing Betsy, who does indeed do some \\"bobbing\\" up and down on the waves and billows: \\"Suddenly the sea was lighted up by a vivid glare. The ship, now in the far distance, caught fire, blew up and sank beneath the waves.\\"<br /><br />No mention is made of the fate of the other passengers or of Betsy's guardians.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the tiny northern Winkie kingdom of Oogaboo, irritable queen Ann Soforth ('And so forth') has decided to conquer all of Oz through the use of her army, which consists of four Colonels, four Captains, four Generals, four Majors and one soldier.<br /><br />The third plot thread finds the Shaggy Man tramping across Oz in search of his missing brother, who he believes has been captured by the Nome King. Ozma, concerned about the Shaggy Man's progress, sends Tik-Tok to assist him, though he promptly gets thrown down a well.<br /><br />Potentially interesting new character Princess Ozga, a beautiful vegetable woman grown from a rose bush, remains underdeveloped and underutilized, while the apparently always-on-standby Polychrome strays from the rainbow yet again, and acts, here as elsewhere, as a convenient deus ex machina whenever Baum writes himself into a tight corner.<br /><br />To his credit, Baum allows Polychrome a little more common sense and perception than she reveals in other titles.<br /><br />Arch Oz villain Ruggedo, whose original name was Roquat before he drank from the 'Waters of Oblivion,' is alternately called the Metal Monarch or the Nome (Gnome) King, while on the other side of the planet readers are introduced to the \\"Famous Fellowship of Fairies,\\" which is overseen by the Jinjin, who is also known as the Private Citizen and as Tititi-Hoochoo, a name which must have delighted grade school boys and irked educators for decades.<br /><br />Readers never learn the true name of Shaggy Man's brother, but, when he is not referred to as such, is simply called the Ugly One due to a punishing enchantment Ruggedo has cast upon him. Like the Little Wizard and Dorothy and Captain Bill and Trot, the Shaggy Man and Betsy eventually form a partnership: elderly man-little girl relationships lacking blood ties are common in the Oz chronicle.<br /><br />A good indicator of a weak Baum title is an absence of imaginative description, as readers will find here.<br /><br />Baum's Nome Kingdom might have been wondrously described, as E. T. A. Hoffman detailed his own underground fairyland in 'The Mines of Falun.' Hoffman's underground caves, mines, and tunnels emit a claustrophobia readers can feel, a strange otherworldly magic that is both threatening and powerfully seductive. Once Baum establishes that his characters are underground, except for a brief scene in a metal forest, readers are left to visualize the rocky, gem-rich nome world as best they can, or rely wholly on John R. Neill's humorous illustrations.<br /><br />In an apparent mistake on Baum's part, sorceress Glinda the Good's castle on the far boundary of the southern kingdom of the Quadlings is said to \\"stand far north of the Emerald City where Ozma holds her court,\\" despite the two comprehensive maps which open and close the book and demonstrate that the castle rightly stands in the red southern kingdom of the Quadlings where it should.<br /><br />Oz newcomers beware: 'Tik-Tok Of Oz' reads much like the uninspired retread it is; like the clockwork man himself, the book is sorely in need of additional winding under its left arm.<br /><br />Baum should have saved the few good ideas he introduced here for his next entirely new manuscript.

Kirkpatrick's 'Edgar Cayce: An American Prophet' methodically considers the facts in the life of a man whose story may be the best documented Fortean case study in modern history.  Kirkpatrick writes well, and has clearly immersed himself in his subject.<br /><br />Considering that Cayce's personal history ostensibly involved dowsing, ancestors with unusual powers, a lifelong relationship with fairies (\\"little folk\\"), visitations from message - bearing, heaven-sent angels, mysterious turbaned men who disappear after uttering cryptic warnings, devastating, unexplainable fires, remarkable medical diagnoses given while in a trance state, accurate prophesies about the future, unaccountable knowledge of past events in the lives of strangers, ghosts, and shadowy government conspiracies, Cayce's abilities, encounters, and experiences were extraordinary indeed.<br /><br />Kirkpatrick takes the reader on a cautious, careful trip through the first half of Cayce's life in the American South and Midwest, supporting his case with persuasive evidence gathered from a variety of respected sources over a period of decades.  However, Kirkpatrick occasionally seems too willing to accept Cayce's more unusual experiences at face value, and offers little in the way of skepticism, disbelief, or alternative explanations; for instance, the role that multiple family tragedies and serious head injuries may have played in Cayce's childhood experiences and later development go almost completely unexamined.  Therefore, the book has Cayce's stamp upon it rather than Kirkpatrick's: from time to time Kirkpatrick seems more like a mild-mannered Cayce apologist than he does an unbiased, objective biographer.<br /><br />For discriminating readers, the real problem with both Cayce's story and Kirkpatrick's biography comes in the later half of Cayce's life, when people began asking 'the Source'--the voice which responded to questions put to Cayce while in trance--about astrology, reincarnation, and death.<br /><br />As in most of the 'New Age' channeling cases of the eighties, suddenly Edgar, his family, and seemingly everyone they know has been a notorious historical figure at some point in their karmic cycle, a Helen of Troy, a Hector, an Achilles, or a Queen of England, a Pharaoh, or an apostle of Jesus Christ: no fishwives or shoemakers here.<br /><br />Cayce's young son, according to the Source, has been both a Pharaoh and one of Christ's apostles; Cayce's attractive, hard working young assistant, Gladys Davis, has been not only a British queen, but, as such, was also Cayce's own royal mother. With this lengthy series of revelations, Cayce's and Kirkpatrick's credibility quickly wilts, as the Source's claims become increasingly overextended, outlandish, and absurd. Readers may find themselves listlessly awaiting their own favorite historical figure to manifest, be it Diana of Nemi, Bishop Pontopippidan, Genghis Khan, Ponce de Leon, Cromwell, Major Andre, or Catherine the Great.<br /><br />Sadly, Cayce, his family, and his followers whole-heartedly embraced the Source's pronouncements concerning their past lives, love affairs, and relationships.<br /><br />As Cayce and many of those around him were financially destitute, barely educated, and often hungry, Kirkpatrick should have thoroughly considered what needs these attractive grandiosities may have filled, and how these compensatory beliefs affected their individual and collective psyches.<br /><br />Cayce and his friends and followers were almost all fervent Christians--Cayce was a biblical scholar and lecturer--but clearly they all desperately needed something greater and closer to home to believe in. It's not difficult to understand why Cayce had so many followers: not only did he medically heal hundreds of people during his lifetime, but the Source's metaphysical doctrine continually emphasized the universe as a wholly benevolent place, one composed of a rich, intricate fabric of meaning, spiritual guidance, and continuous second chances. In the Source's cosmology, there is no such thing as genuine evil, but only pathology, vulnerability, misunderstanding, guilt, and a world of imperfect souls struggling towards the Godhead.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is enough hard evidence to make a case for the validity of much of the otherwise inexplicable anomalous phenomena in the first half of Cayce's existence.<br /><br />Due to the substantial documentation, many of the events in Cayce's life can be used as Fortean test cases to establish standards by which the other paranormal phenomena can be judged and weighted.  As the lives of Carl Jung, Hilda Doolitle, and William Butler Yeats attest, subjective experience--especially concerning paranormal phenomena--should never be mocked or dismissed out of hand. However, some Fortean phenomena, such as the notorious events believed to have occurred throughout the life of science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, appear to be the product of delusion, mental illness, or any number of other psychological factors, many of which are presently little understood, when compared to the Cayce evidence.<br /><br />'Edgar Cayce: An American Prophet' will make an interesting object lesson for Forteans, including as it does detailed, well-supported information about the wide range of paranormal phenomena which dominated Cayce's life. Harry Houdini, Nicolas Telsa, Thomas Edison, and an American president also make brief appearances. Readers who credit all of Cayce's metaphysical divinations may also want to read the late Joe Fisher's harrowing 'The Siren Call of Hungry Ghosts' (2001) for another perspective on the validity and dangers of surrendering the human will to 'channeled' 'spirit guides' and the presumed souls of the dead.tual guidance, and continuous second chances.

US	35944741	R19VRC9IZQY80L	092960556X	133576023	The Silver Princess in Oz	Books	1	6	7	N	N	Romping About The Universe Unattended	After almost twenty years of continual Oz authorship, Ruth Plumly Thompson was clearly exhausted of ideas and energy by the time she completed 1938's 'The Silver Princess In Oz.' Like John R. Neill's 'Lucky Bucky In Oz,' this entry into the Oz chronicle reads more like a rough draft than a finished manuscript; portions of several chapters make no sense at all and are impossible to follow as published.<br /><br />Coming well before the American science fiction boom of the fifties, with 'The 'Silver Princess In Oz,' Thompson added ostensible extraterrestrials to the Oz landscape. In fairness, the extraterrestrials Thompson created for the book, Planetty and Thun the Thunder Colt, are creatures of fairytale convention and a far cry from the bug-eyed saucer men and glittering robots of the later age. The possibility of mixing the Oz fairyland with inhabitants of other planets is an interesting one, and one illustrator John R. Neill accomplished beautifully in his first authored Oz title, 1940's 'The Wonder City of Oz' (though Neill's extraterrestrials were only warmongering mocha soldiers from a distant chocolate star).<br /><br />In previous books Thompson had created vital, admirable, and multi-dimensional Oz heroines, such as Handy Mandy and Peg Amy, who made excellent role models for young readers. Thompson fails here not because Planetty, the Girl from Anuther Planet and her fire-breathing steed are creatures of fairytale romance, but simply because Planetty fails as a character and role model of any kind.<br /><br />Insipid, empty-headed, and oozing honeyed sweetness, Planetty, who is supposed to be a warrior, wins out over self-fascinated sky fairy Polychrome and the brain-poor Button-Bright as Oz's most tiresomely insensible character. Like Polychrome, Planetty is blissfully narcissistic; she spends the balance of the novel prancing, primping, and cheerfully speaking baby talk with a lisp.<br /><br />Illustrator Neill clearly understood the limitations of Thompson's text, for the book includes no less than 11 unelaborate illustrations of the silver-skinned Planetty striking empty poses for an audience in absentee. Planetty is first cousin to the vacuous lingerie model who glides through the high fashion salon chanting \\"Our new one piece lace foundation garment; zips up the back, and no bones,\\" in the 1939 film 'The Women': both exist solely on a catwalk in a parallel universe all of their own.<br /><br />The story of 'The Silver Princess Of Oz' is an empty retread of one of several already overused Oz blueprints. To escape dull court life and an unwanted marriage, young Gillikin King Randy of Regalia and Kabumpo the Elegant Elephant journey to Ev to visit mutual friend the Red Jinn. On the way, the two meet the space girl and her horse, who have unintentionally fallen to Oz down the back of a lightening bolt. Reaching the Jinn's castle, the foursome discover subversives have ousted the Jinn and taken over the realm. Briefly captured, Randy, Kabumpo, Planetty, and Thun escape to search of the missing magician.<br /><br />Thun, who communicates by exhaling words of smoke, is no more interesting than Planetty, and King Randy is identical to all other young Thompson boy heroes. Creating new characters was Thompson's forte, but in 'The Silver Princess In Oz' she failed completely, and none of classic members of the Oz royal family appear to add liveliness or spunk to the plodding, repetitive narrative.<br /><br />'The Silver Princess In Oz' is also burdened with racial stereotypes, for the Red Jinn's subjects are \\"blacks,\\" a color not usually associated with an Oz or Ev people or territory.  As Neill's illustrations and Thompson's text make clear, the word \\"black\\" is not an arbitrary distinction: the Jinn's turban-wearing people are Africans or African Americans, \\"as black as the ace of spades,\\" who, when fleeing in fear, cry \\"Yah, yah, mah, Master!\\"<br /><br />Less than a plum of an Oz book, \\"The Silver Princess In Oz' is oneof the few titles which deserves the relative obscurity to which many of the later Oz books have fallen.of the few titles which deserves the relative obscurity to which many of the later Oz books have fallen.	2003-02-10
US	35944741	RNE4CI0ET126T	0929605608	622993202	Merry Go Round in Oz	Books	3	9	9	N	N	Oz In The Atomic Age	1963's 'Merry Go Round In Oz,' written by the mother-daughter team of Eloise and Lauren McGraw, was, as Katherine M. Rogers notes in 'L. Frank Baum: Creator of Oz' (2002), the last Oz title commissioned by a major publisher.<br /><br />Neither good nor bad, 'Merry Go Round In Oz' was also the first major Oz novel to almost completely remove itself in tone from the spirit of the classic Oz titles.<br /><br />The book is not only not a romance, but, despite the prominent appearance of the Easter Bunny, hardly an Oz novel at all. Its very light, crisp manner owes more to Mary Poppins author P. L. Travers than it does to Baum or any of his successors.<br /><br />The book's excellent first chapter finds young foster child Robin Brown accompanying his multiple stepbrothers to an evening carnival in Cherryburg, Oregon.<br /><br />Continuously overlooked by his well-meaning but rambunctious foster family, Robin enters the carnival with a single coin; the others have all run off with pockets full of money towards their favorite amusements. The McGraws perfectly capture the essence of Robin's physical and emotional isolation from not only his new family, but from the balance of humanity as well. Robin, who is aware of his mistreatment, is thus an archetypal fairytale child protagonist, not unlike fellow orphan Cinderella, bearing up silently and bravely making the best of his predicament.<br /><br />When Robin, who has modestly hoped for but a single ride on the merry-go-round, meets a strange, ticket-bearing older man dressed in tatters, his fairytale outsider status is confirmed: Robin sees things and meets people that no one else does.<br /><br />The McGraws cleverly portray the fair grounds in somewhat Bradbury-esque terms: the night carnival is both an all-American, fifties-style entertainment venue of roller coasters, popcorn, and hot dogs as well as Pinocchio's midway of shadowy seduction.<br /><br />Transgressing the rules of order, Robin uses the illicit ticket provided by the stranger to gain access to the merry-go-round, seats himself atop a beautiful red mare, and momentarily finds himself hurled through the air towards Oz.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Robin, who gleefully discovers that his mount has sprung to life, lands in the comparatively dull Quadling Kingdom of the Fox Hunters, a place he quickly finds tedious in the extreme.<br /><br />As readers will be able to attest, Robin is absolutely right: his prolonged captivity among the endlessly talkative, single-minded, faux-British inhabitants represents one of the most overwritten, slowly moving, and irritating misadventures in the entire Oz chronicle.<br /><br />The authors clearly intend the obsessive, fully adult foxhunters to be amusing, but the writing, while technically crisp, drones on at exactly the same bantering pitch for dozens and dozens of pages. Robin and the reader thus face the same exhausting dilemma.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the ostensibly blue Munchkin kingdom of Halidom, a curse of sorts lays over the land: two of the kingdom's magic rings of power have been stolen, and the third, which gives great physical strength to Halidom's people, now mysteriously vanishes.<br /><br />In Sleeping Beauty fashion, the kingdom falls into lassitude and drowse: only Fess, a young man born in a neighboring land, and an immortal fairy unicorn are immune. Brainless Prince Gules, still half asleep, decides the power rings must be returned to the kingdom, and a quest is born.<br /><br />In the Emerald City, Ozma and Dorothy decide to hold an Easter party, which necessitates Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion journeying to the realm of the Easter Bunny (\\"it's down a rabbit hole,\\" says Dorothy) to gather magical eggs. In traditional Oz fashion, the three groups eventually cross paths and unite to solve their various troubles.<br /><br />Though the later chapters are more imaginative, the book's largest drawback is that too much of it seems to take place in a dry, mundane world that barely resembles Oz.<br /><br />In fact, the foxhunting chapters seem like sections of another book awkwardly grafted onto a stale facsimile of a traditional Oz title.<br /><br />While the best of the earlier books have a dreamlike, otherworldly quality, Oz here, in keeping with the trend in children's literature at the time of its publication and since, has few numinous characteristics. In place of romantic, playful, or absurd names like Woot the Wanderer, Ojo the Unlucky, Polychrome the Rainbow's Daughter, Kabumpo, Alexample, and Jenny Jump, the reader is confronted with next-door neighbor monikers like Barry, Richard, and Fred.<br /><br />The Quadling land is no longer profusely red in color as in the Neill books, where the sky, water, and even in the shade and shadows were scarlet-hued. Oddly, though red is mentioned, the dominant Quadling color inexplicably appears to be pink.<br /><br />Though ninety-nine percent of previous Oz history goes unmentioned, the McGraws curiously recap the earthly existence/afterlife facet of the Oz chronicle, relaying to readers that Dorothy, among others, has cheated death and reached Oz via otherwise fatal catastrophes (cyclone, earthquake, shipwreck).<br /><br />Is the tattered stranger Robin meets at the carnival the angel of death, a kind of fairy godfather, or the ghost of his human father? Does the \\"free ticket\\" symbolize Robin's passage into death and the heavenly paradise of Oz? Is the somewhat odd inclusion of the Easter Bunny a further metaphor for Robin's death and rebirth?<br /><br />The authors also let drop another historical Oz bombshell when a Quadling ferryman explains to the gender-neutral named Robin that little girl fairy ruler Ozma was at one time little Munchkin boy Tip. Though Robin \\"bursts out, delighted,\\" at the news, the McGraws quickly add that this makes Ozma seem \\"more approachable\\" in dungaree-wearing Robin's eyes.<br /><br />'Merry Go Round In Oz' was very likely an attempt by its authors and publisher to reinvent the Oz series for Camelot and 'Leave It To Beaver'-era America. Robin and Fess are likable, sturdy boy heroes, and the characterizations of the Oz royal family are fairly good. If the foxhunters had been removed and the first third of the story reimagined, the book might have left a lasting impact.t barely resembles Oz.<br /><br />In fact, the foxhunting chapters seem like sections of another book awkwardly grafted onto a stale facsimile of a traditional Oz title.<br /><br />While the best of the earlier books have a dreamlike, otherworldly quality, Oz here, in keeping with the trend in children's literature at the time of its publication and since, has few numinous characteristics.

These fairy stories, some which also came from immigrant European grandparents, were also a part of the larger American media culture, and books on the subject, such as 1951's 'The Golden Books Treasury of Elves and Fairies,' could easily be found in libraries and kindergarten classrooms across the country.<br /><br />In addition to fireside and classroom fairy songs (such as 'White Coral Bells') and widely anthologized children's poems like James Whitcomb Riley's 'Little Orphan Annie' and 'The Pixy People,' there were an abundance of books like Johnny Gruelle's 'Raggedy Ann in the Deep Deep Woods' (1930), the Oz books of L. Frank Baum, Ruth Plumly Thompson, and John R. Neill, and the 16 Brownie books of Palmer Cox. Also widely available were the equally popular 'flower fairy' picture book series by Cicely Mary Barker.<br /><br />Even the Brownies division of the Girl Scouts of America reflected the fairy mythology in its literature: to see a helpful brownie, a young girl need only look into a pond or stream under a full moon, and the brownie--in fact the young girl's own reflection--would magically appear.<br /><br />During the first half of the 20th century, Santa Claus was commonly depicted as surrounded by toy-making elves with pointed ears in his North Pole estate, and knee-hugging, green or red Christmas pixies were common holiday toys and tree ornaments. Early 20th century Halloween post cards imported from Germany depicted the natural world as a place teeming with mischief-making boogies, goblins, and elves of every shape and color. Most American children were familiar with the tooth fairy, and the Sandman, who brought sleep to children on a nightly basis, was a kind of fairy too.<br /><br />By the second half of the 20th century, however, America was rapidly moving away from its agricultural roots and the romantic sensibility that had dominated the arts for generations and given rise to these tales and images. By the end of the 1950s, most children were still familiar with the Disney film interpretations of the 'Snow White' (1938) and 'Cinderella' (1950) tales, and recognized Tinkerbell, at the opening of each segment of 'The Wonderful World of Disney,' as a fairy, if not as the single fairy character present in Disney's adaptation of J. M. Barrie's 'Peter Pan' (1951). Disney continued to keep fairies before the public, producing movies like 'Sleeping Beauty,' 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People' (both 1959) and 'The Gnome Mobile' (1967).<br /><br />In 1960s television programs as diverse as 'Bonanza' (1959-1973), 'Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea' (1964-1968), and 'Bewitched' (1964-1972), leprechaun and elf figures were prominently featured, though those on 'Bonanza' were eventually revealed to be dwarf actors perpetrating a hoax.<br /><br />In the advertising world, elves sold everything from Keebler cookies and Coca-Cola to Bacardi Rum.<br /><br />Johnny Gruelle's beautifully written 'Raggedy Ann in the Deep Deep Woods' (1930) is a pure, relatively early product of this era, and as delightful now as it was at the time of its release.<br /><br />As its story begins, Raggedy Ann and Raggedy Andy are adventuring in the deep woods, a world of \\"fairies and everything,\\" a place where every creature--whether doll, animal, or elf--helps all others on principal and enjoys bringing delight to anyone encountered. Gruelle immediately pulls the reader into Raggedy Ann's and Raggedy Andy's lovely and colorful fantasy world, which, in mood, isthe kind of environment that many parents in the days before television attempted to provide for their very young children. The idea in those not-so-distant times was to help children see the world as a warm, fantastic, and cooperative place bursting with potential, where envy, selfishness, bad manners, and aggression are plainly wrong and readily disarmed by love, understanding, and tenderness.<br /><br />Raggedy Ann carries a magic Wishing Pebble, which she constantly uses to bring happiness and material satisfaction to needy or less fortunate others.  Raggedy Ann and Andy set a good example by being thoughtful, attentive sweethearts to one another, but everyone they meet--whether owl, rabbit, bee, or bear--or fairy, elf, or gnome--comes in for their kindly attention, politeness, and appreciation. Raggedy Ann and Andy are curious and enthusiastic, and only capable of seeing the good and the positive potential in the world around them.<br /><br />Thus, in every way 'Raggedy Ann in the Deep Deep Woods' promotes solid Christian values of charity, kindliness, and faith in the decent hearts and intentions of others. Every child deserves to be exposed to this world at least briefly.<br /><br />Gruelle's remarkable, lollypop-colored illustrations of the anthropomorphic fairyland, which nonetheless represent the book's reality principle, are perfectly fused with the text and add enormously to the book's power.<br /><br />'Raggedy Ann in the Deep Deep Woods' is an all-audiences volume which will thrill children, parents, educators, and those cynical individuals who have lost their way in the world and their faith in themselves.the kind of environment that many parents in the days before television attempted to provide for their very young children.

Neill's death, 'The Runaway In Oz' at last saw print for the first time in 1995.<br /><br />Neill had authored and illustrated one classic in the Oz chronicle, 1940's 'The Wonder City Of Oz,' though his two books that followed, 'The Scalawagons In Oz' (1941) and 'Lucky Bucky In Oz' (1942), both suffered from weak plots, convoluted storytelling, and poor editing.<br /><br />In the early nineties, artist and writer Eric Shanower, in conjunction with Neill's family, rescued, edited, and illustrated 'The Runaway In Oz,' and by doing so not only gave the world another fabulous Oz title, but salvaged Neill's reputation as the author of only a single great entry in the Oz series.<br /><br />Everything about 'The Runaway In Oz' is perfect.<br /><br />Neill wisely choose to limit his cast to a half-dozen characters, thus allowing his narrative to revolve primarily around the group's interrelationships, though there is also rip-roaring action aplenty.<br /><br />Neill not only chose the popular Scraps the Patchwork Girl as his protagonist, but also allowed Professor Wooglebug and Jack Pumpkinhead, two woefully under-utilized reader favorites, the honor of playing major roles in an Oz tale. Neill's own creation, headstrong style guru Jenny Jump, one of the most distinctive of all Oz heroines, is also on hand as a key player in the drama.<br /><br />Neill and Shanower respectfully honor established Oz history, and their attention to detail, old and new, is remarkable.<br /><br />The Wooglebug's 'dream castle' is literally a product of his intensely directed desires, and when tenderhearted Jack Pumpkinhead weeps, he logically sheds pumpkinseed tears.<br /><br />Oz devotees will be thrilled to see Jack's whimsical Shoe Orchestra from 'The Wonder City In Oz' back for another extended series of concerts, and, as in the three earlier Neill books, every illustration of Jenny Jump reveals her with a new outre hairstyle, some that look back on twenties Dada and others that presciently look forward to seventies Punk and eighties New Wave.<br /><br />Readers will also learn that the Little Wizard has returned Jenny's temper to her with the understanding that she promise not 'lose it' again.<br /><br />The Patchwork Girl's obnoxious but previously acceptable poetry-spouting habit becomes an active element of the story, as Scraps suddenly finds herself in a repulsive world in which everyone she meets seems to be an enthusiastic and compulsive rhymer.<br /><br />In fact, 'The Runaway In Oz' revolves around all aspects of Scraps' antisocial behavior.<br /><br />As the novel begins, Jellia Jamb, the Tin Woodman, and Jenny Jump have all grown impatient with the boisterous Patchwork Girl's thoughtlessness; feeling rejected and unappreciated, Scraps decides to run away from the Emerald City and from Oz itself.<br /><br />Though Scraps never gets beyond the borders of the kingdom despite her best efforts, she manages to accidentally unknot the Wooglebug's 'Castle in the Air' from its moorings, infuriate a mountaintop-dwelling witch that controls all of the world's weather, and strand herself on a shooting star high in the heavens above Oz.<br /><br />Along the way, Scraps makes several interesting new friends and traveling companions, including \\"talented and gifted\\" boy scholar Alexample, the leafy Popla the Power Plant, and the Twinkler, an older man imprisoned on the star and forced to polish its lights for eternity.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jenny Jump and Jack Pumpkinhead, who are eventually joined by the fretful, castle-searching Wooglebug, have set out in search of Scraps; Jenny feels guilty for having told Scraps that \\"no one wants to be bothered\\" by her \\"tantrums,\\" and though Jack Pumpkinhead's motives are less clear, his behavior appears to have something to do with romantic attachment as well as human concern.<br /><br />The Professor, Jack, and Jenny find themselves lost for days in an enchanted orchard, where they are attacked by an army of thorn-bearing quince apples, who are in revolt against being sold at market like common fruits and vegetables. By the time the two parties meet, almost everyone is furious at Scraps except Jack, and the Wooglebug is enraged at everyone.<br /><br />'The Runaway In Oz' is great fun throughout. The narrative is smooth, streamlined, and grounded, less manic and explosive than 'The Wonder City In Oz,' but no less hilarious.<br /><br />Neill's real forte as an Oz author was characterization, something Shanower seemed to fully appreciate when editing the manuscript. In fact, the depiction of Scraps here may be the best of any of the Oz titles, since her irritating qualities, always recognized by readers but only rarely by other Oz characters, are realistically acknowledged and addressed head on.<br /><br />'The Runaway In Oz' portrays Scraps as immature, callous, irresponsible, willful, and vain while simultaneously revealing her foresight, courage, intelligence, determination, concern for others, and eventual common sense and humility.  If Jack Pumpkinhead is slightly more downtrodden than usual and the Wooglebug more uppity, longtime Oz fans know there are precedents for their behavior in earlier titles.<br /><br />Shanower's illustrations are extremely detailed, clear, and timelessly perfect.<br /><br />Alexample, though an Oz citizen and apparent native, bears no resemblance to Woot the Wanderer, Ojo the Lucky, or Button Bright. Instead, he is a clean-cut, eyeglass-wearing young boy in fifties-style clothing; only his thick, black hair hints at romanticism.<br /><br />Jenny Jump was already a modern gal in Neill's earlier titles and illustrations, and continues to be one here. Shanower's Professor Wooglebug, a wonderful balance of erudition, pomposity, enthusiasm, and frustration, surpasses even Neill's.<br /><br />Shanower's weather witch is not even a fourth cousin to traditional hag Old Mombi, but a tough, capable, mature woman in worker's overalls.<br /><br />Popla the Power Plant is a shrub whose beautiful woman's face is hidden within her branches, the female counterpart of the European Green Man of history, architecture, and folklore.<br /><br />From its cover to its double-page drawings and lovely illustrated blue end papers, this edition joyously reflects Shanower's commitment that 'The Runaway In Oz' be every bit as beautiful as the Baum/Neill books that preceded it.ed orchard, where they are attacked by an army of thorn-bearing quince apples, who are in revolt against being sold at market like common fruits and vegetables.

Looking back on the series today, it seems clear that the quality of the Oz books understandably suffered as a result of this policy. Royal Historians Baum, Thompson, and Neill at some point all submitted material that seemed forced, as if it were traced from an overused blueprint rather than created from inspiration with enthusiasm.<br /><br />Thompson's tenure was winding down by the time she wrote 'Captain Salt In Oz' (1936), a novel that suffers, as all the worst of the Oz books do, from being in plot and theme about nothing in particular.  As in Thompson's 'The Silver Princess In Oz' (1938), much of the writing is leaden and almost impossible to follow comfortably. 'Captain Salt In Oz' reads like a manuscript in which the primary story has been extracted; worse, its narrative could have been told in one-fourth of its 306 pages.<br /><br />Blending together elements from Ballantyne's 'The Coral Island,' Kipling's 'Captains Courageous,' and Burroughï's Tarzan mythos, 'Captain Salt In Oz,' while occasionally lively in tone, comes to little except some very mild adventures at sea.  Ex-pirate and present-day \\"Royal Oz Explorer\\" Captain Salt and ship's cook Ato, out colonizing for Ozma on the high seas, rescue petulant young king Tandy from a tropical island prison.  Neurotically obsessed with maintaining his regal status while on board the galleon (the Crescent Moon, in homage to Henry Hudson's Half Moon), in time Tandy learns to discard his notions of elitism and live life as the carefree young boy he really is.<br /><br />The trouble is that there is no tension, drama, or adversity in Tandy's catharsis: the waters surrounding him are not stormy and perilous, but brackish and tepid.  No villains threaten; no obstacles frustrate. Considering that the story takes place in Oz, where almost anything can happen, almost nothing does.<br /><br />'Captain Salt In Oz' is further out at sea that it realizes, and not waving but drowning. No members of the Oz royal family appear, and while pacifist Captain Salt is an energetic, colorful character, he is given little to do but reflect fondly on his previous life as a cutlass-wielding buccaneer. Thompson had an extreme weakness for generic boy kings, and Tandy is in no way distinguishable from any of those that came before him. Those who would like to experience what Thompson made of Oz should consider her excellent 'Kabumpo In Oz' (1922) instead.does.<br /><br />'Captain Salt In Oz' is further out at sea that it realizes, and not waving but drowning.

'The Patchwork Girl Of Oz' is Baum's most fluid, well rounded, and detailed children's novel.<br /><br />Recognizing the increasing danger from lands beyond, at the end of 1910's 'The Emerald City Of Oz,' child ruler Ozma and sorceress Glinda decided to magically close Oz off from the outside world forever.<br /><br />In reality, Baum was tired of Oz and wanted to develop other ideas and projects. But hounded by young fans to provide more stories of the utopist fairyland, in 1913 Baum again took up his pen as Royal Historian.<br /><br />Explaining to readers that he had begun receiving new tales from the Shaggy Man via a wireless telegraph in Oz, the fruit of this partnership was 'The Patchwork Girl Of Oz,' probably the general favorite of Baum's novels among dedicated Oz enthusiasts. In fact, 'The Patchwork Girl Of Oz' is the book appreciated even by those who dislike the Oz series as a whole.<br /><br />In poetry-spouting Scraps the Patchwork Girl, Baum introduced a vibrant, riveting figure to his fairyland, one equal to earlier classic creations the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Wooglebug, and the Gnome King.<br /><br />Rowdy, grotesque Scraps was perhaps Baum's last great character; indefatigable and indomitable, Scraps was also Baum's most original and fully realized female character, whether human, fairy, sorceress, or otherwise.<br /><br />A winning combination of common sense and nonsense, Scraps, a kind of nightmare version of Raggedy Ann, is pleasantly naive, utterly free, tactless, curious, and enthusiastic about all facets of life, including romance.<br /><br />Though stuffed with cotton, Scraps finds the straw-packed Scarecrow a perfect dreamboat, and finds twig-bodied Jack Pumpkinhead attractive as well. John R. Neill's illustrations of the Scraps and the Scarecrow's 'hearts aflutter' first meeting is hilarious.<br /><br />A reconfiguration of the happy peasant figure who blissfully notices that the emperor is naked and doesn't hesitate to say so, Scraps, though not an outright trickster figure, approaches trickster status.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other titles in the series that have a predominantly sketchy narrative, 'The Patchwork Girl Of Oz' is composed of enthusiastic, rollicking prose that allows the reader to happily suspend disbelief. All Oz titles have filler chapters that pad the books and add little to their forward motion, and the Patchwork Girl Of Oz has its share. However, the filler chapters here--'The Troublesome Phonograph' and 'The Foolish Owl and the Wise Donkey'--don't irritate or distract from the story's forward motion as much as they might.<br /><br />Far from being finished with Oz, in 1913 Baum was still working out the magical laws that would govern his fairyland kingdom; readers will note that those laws applied here differ somewhat from those provided in 1918's 'The Tin Woodman Of Oz.'<br /><br />Most noticeably, young Ojo the Unlucky is described as a growing boy; in the later books, all characters would be permanently fixed in their ages and physical growth or decline would become impossible (which of course raises the question of who each citizen of Oz came into being in the first place).<br /><br />'The Patchwork Girl Of Oz' is almost free of the occasionally unsettling, cruel, or bizarre elements that Baum unconsciously allowed to mar his books; there is a brief explanation of how \\"meat\\" beings, if chopped into pieces, would continue to live, if not thrive, in their newly minced state.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other books in the series, the natural world in 'The Patchwork Girl Of Oz' is lushly underscored and doesn't seem to be a brittle facsimile of the natural world known to readers. There is a loving description of Jack Pumpkinhead's pumpkin patch home, of the Munchkin gardens of \\"blue flowers, blue cabbages, blue carrots, and blue lettuce,\\" and a defense of country living by the itinerant Shaggy Man.<br /><br />A classic of children's literature,'The Patchwork Girl Of Oz' is Baum's best, and a far better book than its more famous antecedent, 'The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz.''The Patchwork Girl Of Oz' is Baum's best, and a far better book than its more famous antecedent, 'The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz.'	2003-01-31

Probably a product of McCloskey's own nostalgia for small town life, the book may remind readers of Elizabeth Enright's 'Thimble Summer' (1939), in which young girl protagonist Garnet Linden discovers the adventures of every day life in the rural Midwest.<br /><br />Homer Price is a quietly confident, unbefuddled, and laconic boy around whom a series of somewhat unusual events occur. In the most memorable episode, Homer tends his progress-seeking but work-shy uncle's lunch counter while its newfangled automatic donut machine, short a piece of its machinery, turns out thousands and thousands of donuts as crowds gather to watch. In other stories, Homer captures a team of robbers with the help of pet skunk Aroma, participates in the winding of what is thought to be the largest ball of string in existence, and helps the sheriff discover the identity of the mysterious stranger that has come to town.<br /><br />Homer's hobby is building radios, which is significant, as the book's world is a pre-television landscape where simple pleasures such as getting a haircut at the local barber shop, pitching horseshoes, or reading the latest issue of Super-Duper comic book at the soda fountain are the highlights of the day, and the autumn county fair the highlight of the year. Throughout, McCloskey subtly weaves the idea of inevitable change, represented not only by the unstoppable donut machine, but by the 100-house suburb of identical, prefabricated houses (each has 'a print of Whistler's Mother over the fireplace') that sprouts up within a week on historical Centerburg land.<br /><br />But McCloskey honors the past while accepting the present and anticipating the future: there are as many mildly progressive citizens of Centerburg as there are mildly traditional ones.<br /><br />All the pieces are charming, light, funny, and pleasant. While there are no heavy-handed messages, good manners, strength of character, and acceptance of eccentricity and difference are stressed. McCloskey also quietly and humorously comments on courting and marriage rituals, politics, and the role of boredom and gossip in small town life. Though the focus is on Homer, the book is in fact about all of the citizens of Centerburg, with Homer really only one of the crowd.<br /><br />Adults will enjoy rediscovering 'Homer Price' and sharing it with children, who may see some merit in Price's unhurried sense of wonder about life, the world, and the simple things around him.e no heavy-handed messages, good manners, strength of character, and acceptance of eccentricity and difference are stressed.

Frank Baum's passing.  Ruth Plumly Thompson, who followed Baum, wrote 19 smoothly written, strong, and inventive titles. Longtime Oz illustrator John R. Neill subsequently authored three, one of which, 'The Wonder City Of Oz' (1940), is a genuine classic in the series.<br /><br />'The Magical Mimics In Oz' (1946), the first of two books by Jack Snow, was yet another success.  While its story is derivative of several past Oz tales, Snow confidently took the driver's seat when he took up his pen; his vision of Oz is spirited, playful, and precise.<br /><br />Most noticeably, Snow gave Dame Nature a prominent role in his conception of the Oz utopia. Princess Ozana's Story Blossom Garden, for example, is extensively and lovingly described: \\"Flowers of every variety grew in profusion. Save for the mossy paths that wound through the garden, there was not a spot on the ground that was without blossoming plants. As for the pond, it was like a small sea of lovely blossoming water plants. At the edge of the pond, Dorothy noted three graceful white swans, sleeping in the shade of a large flowering bush that grew at the edge of the pond and trailed its blossoms into the water. The air was sweet with the perfume of thousands and thousands of flowers.\\"<br /><br />For the fairy Ozana, lonely for the companionship of living things on her mountaintop home were she stands perpetual guard over the evil Mimics, has created a garden of vocal, story-telling flowers. The perfumes of the flowers, Ozana tells Dorothy and the Little Wizard, are the essence of their souls.  Snow lovingly spends an entire chapter on the Story Blossom Garden, and, though the plants have been awakened to a new degree of life by Ozana's magic, Snow makes it clear that nature, in and of itself, is majestic and miraculous.<br /><br />In a later chapter, Toto, Betsy Bobbins, and Hank the Mule take a stroll into the meadows surrounding the Emerald City to pick flowers and enjoy a picnic. Snow writes, \\"there were few things Toto liked better  than to get out in the country and frolic in the fields.\\" Jack Kramer's illustrations of their outing, and of Toto basking in the sun, underscore Snow's Eden-like conception of the simple outdoors.<br /><br />Unlike the depictions of nature in the Baum and Neill books, which characterize Ozian nature as a somewhat brittle facsimile of nature as readers know it, Snow's natural world, like Thompson's, breathes, sings, and emits an intrinsic magic which has nothing to do with sorcery.  Thus Oz, in the Thompson and Snow titles,  is a kind of Arcadia, where nature in its pure state is a powerful, fundamental source of joy and inspiration.<br /><br />'The Magical Mimics In Oz' has been called 'dark' by some, largely because its story sees the Emerald City conquered and its royal family enchanted, imprisoned, and threatened with unpleasant fates.<br /><br />Werewolf-like Queen Ra, the evil leader of the protean Mimics, taunts her bound captives with her plans for their immediate futures: Scraps the Patchwork Girl is to be converted into a pin cushion, the Glass Cat melted down and rolled into marbles, Billina the Yellow Hen roasted for dinner, the Woozy chopped into building blocks, and Tik Tok eternally disassembled and reassembled like a jigsaw puzzle for Ra's amusement.<br /><br />The Scarecrow, who vocally leads the opposition, is simply to be burned to a cinder.  But these threats are clearly paper tigers and bullying threats, more amusing and startling than cause for genuine alarm, as 'The Magical Mimics In Oz,' like the Thompson and Neill chronicles, is a fun and entertaining book without  a genuinely darker subtext.<br /><br />In fact, Baum's own 'The Tin Woodman Of Oz' (1918), with its lengthy focus on actual human dismemberment, is by leaps and bounds the more unsettling story. In that book's color cover illustration, there is red blood on the edge of the Woodman's axe; and the Scarecrow, larking about, sings, \\"to cut me don't hurt, for I've no blood to squirt.\\"<br /><br />Fans of the Baum titles have historically failed to acknowledge that Baum's continual use of the adjective \\"meat\\" (rather than 'flesh') to describe his human and animal characters might be unsettling to small children, for whom consumption of meat is likely a part of their everyday lives.<br /><br />Snow's characterizations  of the Oz royal family are beautifully realized throughout.  'The Magical Mimics In Oz,' more than any other Oz title, regardless of author, is vastly inclusive: Ozma, Glinda, Dorothy, Toto, the Scarecrow, and the Little Wizard are actively present, but so are Professor Wooglebug, the Sawhorse, the Tin Woodman, Tik Tok, the Hungry Tiger, gate keeper Omby Amby, Billina, Aunt Em, Cap'n Bill, Ojo, the Woozy, Button Bright, Uncle Henry, Betsy Bobbin, Hank the Mule, the Cowardly Lion, the Glass Cat, Trot, Jack Pumpkinhead, the Pink Kitten, and Scraps the Patchwork Girl.<br /><br />Even the Frog Man, Dr. Pipt, and Cayke the Cookie Cook get a mention. Sadly, recent Neill creations Number Nine, Jenny Jump, Lucky Bucky, and the Scalawagons are nowhere in evidence. Classic Thompson character Kabumpo the Elegant Elephant is also conspicuously absent.<br /><br />Snow's evil Mimics of Mount Illuso, literal first cousins to the Phanfasms, while not remarkably original, nonetheless make effective villains; happily, Snow allows the Mimics to accomplish some genuine dirty work instead of merely planning and threatening to.<br /><br />New Snow creations Princess Ozana and living pine puppets Mr. and Mrs. Hi-Lo are cheerful additions to the Oz chronicle.<br /><br />Illustrator Jack Kramer's interesting depiction of Mimic King Umb as a horned, cloven-hoofed man-monster may have put some parental noses out of point in 1946; it's interesting that Snow and Kramer avoid a direct depiction of the historical Devil of Christianity by allowing King Umb only one horn, which juts from his forehead like a unicorn's.

US	35944741	R2W69BCUZSQ6CG	0929605497	791854	Handy Mandy in Oz	Books	3	4	8	N	N	A Sprout Well-Budded Out	Is it possible that the fairyland of Oz is really a fictional metaphor for the Christian Heaven, or a fantasy parallel of broader Western conceptions of the afterlife?<br /><br />Ruth Plumly Thompson's 'Handy Mandy In Oz' (1937) begins with young lass goat herd Mandy being propelled into the atmosphere by the sudden eruption of a spring under the mountain on which she lives.  Sudden, potentially fatal acts of nature or abrupt, violent accidents that drive girls and boys into the stratosphere and beyond like corks are common in the Oz books, beginning with the first book, 'The Wonderful Wizard Of Oz,' in which Dorothy is famously carried to Oz by a cyclone.  In the same title, the Wizard has reached Oz by similar means; his hot air balloon has been blown off the face of the Earth by high winds. In 1908's 'Dorothy and The Wizard In Oz,' Dorothy falls through a fissure in the ground during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and in 'The Scarecrow Of Oz' (1915), little Trot and her adult male companion Cap'n Bill also reach the 'other world,' if not Oz directly, by being sucked into a whirlpool.  In John R. Neill's 'Lucky Bucky In Oz' (1942), young lad Bucky is propelled into the lands surrounding Oz by an explosion on a ship in New York Harbor.<br /><br />Does Oz act as a kind of conduit that attracts the living like a magnet under such circumstances, or have Dorothy, Trot, and Bucky passed away into paradise?<br /><br />Interestingly, Baum, who adapted European fairy mythology and Theosophical beliefs for the Oz books, also had a backdoor method for entering Oz: in 1919's 'The Road To Oz,' Dorothy, again back in Kansas, finds herself more or less 'pixie led'--inexplicably lost in a familiar place--while on the road to American city Butterfield. Since the fairies were partially identified with the dead in Ireland and Scotland, Dorothy's \\"straying off the path\\" is open to a number of interpretations.<br /><br />To small Christian children then as now, Oz must certainly seem like Heaven, or least a happy, comforting purgatory where no one goes hungry, wants for anything, or ages; every one of its inhabitants lives forever in almost complete peace and serenity. In fact, Oz, with its minor greedy, power-lusting villains and occasional upsets, is perhaps more akin to Heaven before Lucifer's rebellion and expulsion.<br /><br />For Dorothy, who is eventually and permanently joined in Oz by beloved animal companion Toto and parental guardians Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, Oz is paradise, a place with just enough novelty and tension to make infinity enjoyable forever.<br /><br />If Oz enjoys a god figure, then it is child fairy Ozma; but Ozma, relatively mature sorceress Glinda the Good, and especially over-conceived sky voluptuary Polychrome are more akin to the traditional image of Christian angels.<br /><br />Outside its own borders, Oz has its hell and its devils too. Every Oz reader knows about the underground cavern kingdom of the Gnomes, which lies across the burning, fiery-hot desert in Ev (Evil?), and of Ev's demonic, shape-shifting Phanfasms, most malevolent of all Oz and Ev tribes.<br /><br />'Handy Mandy in Oz' is one of the lesser Thompson titles, enjoyable enough in itself but not quite developed enough in its narrative to join the classics in the Oz chronicle. Thompson introduces Mandy, who has seven arms, but, in clever conjunction with illustrator John R. Neill, doesn't make this apparent until the book's third chapter. Suddenly discovering herself in a Gillikin kingdom lorded over by a domineering false king, Mandy meets \\"royal ox\\" Nox, and the two escape in search of deposed boy king Kerry, who has been missing for two Oz years.<br /><br />Handy Mandy, who has a decided Protestant work ethic, is a solidly built, self-reliant, no-nonsense lass who, all things considered, makes an excellent role model. Thompson wisely fails to stress whether or not Mandy is beautiful, and allows Mandy a certain toughness of mind: Mandy has to be the only heroic Oz character before Jenny Jump who is suspicious of Ozma's buttery sweetness and perceives her Magic Picture to have negative, Big Brother-like potential.<br /><br />In one early chapter, Mandy, resolutely prepared to face any opposition, takes up not only a sword but a rifle, surely an Ozian first. Curmudgeon Nox the Ox, like Kabumpo the Elegant Elephant before him, is a similarly well-conceived character; Nox realistically loses his temper on occasion and doesn't suffer fools gladly.<br /><br />The villain of the book is fey sorcerer Wutz the Silver King, who Neill hilariously portrays as a slightly decadent, late-period John Barrymore. Wutz frees Ruggedo the Gnome King from his latest in a series of many enchantments and the two unscrupulous beings, ostensibly in partnership, plot against Ozma and one another.<br /><br />The story of 'Handy Mandy In Oz is,' in pattern, so much like other previous Oz titles that the reader will easily guess not only who has captured the missing Kerry but what the outcome of the nefarious plot will be. The resurrection of Ruggedo alone will cause readers to pause to suppress a yawn.<br /><br />As a seven-armed wonder--three on one side, four awkwardly on the other--Handy Mandy may remind readers of an archetypal Indian goddess reinterpreted as a clog-wearing Dutch milkmaid. John R. Neill's illustrations are terrific throughout, including one depicting the futuristic, Art Deco interior of the Silver King's throne room, and another of frenzied Scraps the Patchwork Girl attacking the unprepared Mandy.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other Thompson titles, there are few elements of the book which reflect the influence of the Alice books. However, one of Neill's pictures of Mandy and Nox treading water, heads barely above the surface, appears to be a homage to Tenniel's illustrations for Alice chapter 'The Pool Of Tears,' especially since, as in Carroll, the 'pool' is generated from the body of one of the swimmers.e the only heroic Oz character before Jenny Jump who is suspicious of Ozma's buttery sweetness and perceives her Magic Picture to have negative, Big Brother-like potential.<br /><br />In one early chapter, Mandy, resolutely prepared to face any opposition, takes up not only a sword but a rifle, surely an Ozian first.

MacKenzie has provided Julia with financial support since the termination of their dalliance, which he now declines to continue.<br /><br />Financially and emotionally destitute, Julia leaves Paris and returns to London, where, \\"hoping to rest,\\" she unexpectedly discovers her extended family gathered around their dying mother.<br /><br />Like Jean Genet, Rhys wrote a series of novels about permanent social outsiders and outcasts, and, like Genet, Rhys had only one dark if very human vision to express.<br /><br />Other novelists, such as Erskine Caldwell and Muriel Spark, similarly wrote novels of extremely narrow focus (Caldwell's 'Tobacco Road,' Spark's 'The Driver's Seat' and 'Not To Disturb'), but were also capable of far more varied, optimistic, and expansive works.<br /><br />The antiheroes in Genet's novels find a means of empowering and centering themselves through narcissism, violence, dominance, sexual expression, or mysticism; but Rhys' nonplussed female protagonists are perpetually at square one, never the better for their defeated plans or self-sabotaged efforts.<br /><br />Sadly, Julia finds relief only in brief moments of spontaneous rage or cruelty.<br /><br />Rhys had an acute talent for portraying women in and under such conditions, but it's undeniable that Rhys' vision of harrowing experience, rote abandonment, and human indifference was projected outward onto every facet of her fictional landscapes.  The curtains and wallpaper are always faded, the rented rooms shabby, the maids surly, the proprietresses petty and suspicious, the food tasteless, the milk rancid, relatives disdainful.<br /><br />In fact, Rhys created an entire universe of human desolation in each of her five novels, one from which none of the characters, young or old, male or female, wealthy or without means, are exempted; some merely play the game better and have more resources.<br /><br />One of the most satisfying elements in 'After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie' is Rhys' brutal, very focused examination of those sides of human nature which Western societies prefer to privately deny and publicly avoid.<br /><br />All of Rhys' anti-heroines are socially disenfranchised, emotionally wounded, needy, gullible, and financially insecure; but they are simultaneously often ill tempered, manipulative, callous, arrogant, amoral, and almost entirely self-absorbed. Julia Martin is Rhys' most hard-bitten protagonist, having none of the wisdom or humor that Sasha Jansen has in fourth novel 'Good Morning, Midnight,' nor the innocence of Rhys' earlier ingenues.<br /><br />Somnolent and easily wounded Julia is acutely sensitive, but only occasionally empathetic to the reality of others, unless, in the moment, she sees herself reflected within them.<br /><br />Julia is also a listless parasite and psychic vampire who lives off the emotions, energy, and money of the men with whom she has casual affairs; except for brief periods of work and a failed marriage, this is how she has provided for herself as an adult.<br /><br />In one grim but revelatory scene, the willful Julia indifferently tells the man she is about to lose that she can get another meal ticket any time she wishes, as she always has in the past. Is she speaking out of defensiveness, or simply telling the truth about her power and experience?  For Julia, moments of happiness, enthusiasm, or pleasure are fleeting and as far away as the stars.<br /><br />Readers may wonder exactly what is wrong with Julia; the answer is: Almost Everything.<br /><br />Self-hatred and clinical depression primarily, but Julia is also anxious, passive-aggressive, lonely, financially destitute, lazy, narcissistic, morbidly introverted, co-dependent, anemic, and probably suffering from what is today called 'Borderline Personality Disorder.'  Julia \\"can't be alone, but can't be too close.\\"<br /><br />She is also aware and proud of her outsider status; confronting decent younger sister Norah, Julia rather smugly considers herself the better of the two, the one who has brazenly spit in the face of social convention and middle class morality.<br /><br />Sociopathically, Julia never considers that her rebellion has brought about the sense of failure and low self-esteem from which she painfully suffers, and which approaches nihilism.<br /><br />Rhys, while never less than convincing, hangs so many internal and external albatrosses around Julia's neck that her unhappy existence seems almost fatally determined.<br /><br />Today, Julia would be receiving a maintenance course of serotonin inhibitors.<br /><br />Feminists took up the Rhys cudgel early; indeed, superficially, Rhys' novels and short stories seem tailor made for the feminist cause.<br /><br />But Rhys' novels are no more primarily about the plight of women than Genet's were about the plight of criminal homosexually-inclined men.<br /><br />Rhys cast a wide net in conceiving her fictional worlds; her truths are universal truths that, for better or worse, apply to all. Readers will certainly recognize a kernel of themselves in Rhys' ambivalent, envious, bitter, forlorn, and greedy cast.<br /><br />'After Leaving Mr. MacKenzie' ends with Julia enjoying a second Pernod in a Parisian cafe as twilight falls, a time of day Rhys refers to as \\"the hour between dog and wolf.\\"<br /><br />Since Julia's life can be said to exist only between these two polarities--between the potentially threatening and the actively harmful--the metaphor is apt. Julia, both a continuous victim and a manipulator, if not an outright abuser, herself, is a creature by nature between \\"dog and wolf.\\"swer is: Almost Everything.<br /><br />Self-hatred and clinical depression primarily, but Julia is also anxious, passive-aggressive, lonely, financially destitute, lazy, narcissistic, morbidly introverted, co-dependent, anemic, and probably suffering from what is today called 'Borderline Personality Disorder.'

US	35944741	R2TL7PHSL6ERLX	0486417662	123589421	The Royal Book of Oz (Dover Children's Classics)	Books	5	27	29	N	N	When Knighthood Was In Flower	The first of the 19 Oz titles she authored, Ruth Plumly Thompson's 'The Royal Book Of Oz' (1921) has met with occasional opposition over the years, largely due to the bold steps Thompson took in addressing questions Oz creator L. Frank Baum's 13 original books left unanswered.<br /><br />Thompson was personally elected by Baum himself to become the next \\"Royal Historian of Oz,\\" a fact that should carry more weight with sensitive fans.<br /><br />While Baum deserves enormous credit for creating and sustaining America's premier fantasy land, Thompson's books were also often exceptional; her style was smooth, convincing, and full of the imagination necessary to further the series. Any author following Baum certainly had a difficult task ahead of them.<br /><br />As 'The Royal Book Of Oz opens,' Professor Wooglebug has lighted on the idea of composing a book of his own, one that will trace the genealogy of all members of the Oz Royal Family.<br /><br />While Scraps the Patchwork Girl and several of the others are content with and honest about their humble origins, the aggressive Professor brazenly stresses the importance of legitimate family relationships, bluntly declaring to the assembled that outstanding Oz citizen the Scarecrow has none.<br /><br />Thompson's portrayal of the Wooglebug as an arrogant interloper and snob has offended some, but Thompson was only taking the Wooglebug's already established sense of elitism to its logical conclusion.  His superior attitude does not go unnoticed by the others, especially the sensitive Dorothy; or by the Scarecrow himself, who first inexplicably came to life while strapped to a beanpole in the Munchkin country.<br /><br />Embarrassed and despondent, the Scarecrow sets out alone to discover if he has a legitimate \\"family tree.\\"<br /><br />Thompson's ingenious solution to the cause of the Scarecrow's sentience was probably something even she thought a gamble.<br /><br />Returning to the Munchkin country and the exact site of his origin, the Scarecrow discovers that his former beanpole extends far into the earth, and while digging at its base, tumbles into a hole that inexplicably opens around it. He falls a great distance--Thompson suggests that the Silver Island kingdom into which he eventually emerges is one the opposite side of the earth.<br /><br />Greeted in a great royal palace by a throng of awed silver-skinned Asians, the Scarecrow discovers that he not only has 3 sons, 15 grandchildren, and thousands of loyal subjects, but a vast kingdom.<br /><br />For the Scarecrow is none other than the reincarnation of the country's former emperor, dead now some 50 years. Initially thrilled if a little dismayed, the Scarecrow comes to regret the enormous responsibility that his \\"family tree\\" and his subject's expectations bring.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a thankfully limited expedition composed of Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion has set out in search of their missing patriot, who Dorothy suspects has been wounded by the Professor's remarks.<br /><br />Thompson must have been an admirer of Lewis Carroll, for, as in later Thompson titles, many of the team's adventures have a Wonderland-like character.<br /><br />In one dazzlingly executed chapter, Dorothy and the Lion find themselves trapped in the strange city of Pokes (\\"Pocus\\"), where the residents contently live in perpetual drowse and move more slowly than their pet snails.<br /><br />There the journeyers discover Arthurian knight Sir Hocus, who has been held captive by the sleepwalking spell for centuries.

US	35944741	R1XBUI4DH8J6XU	0929605179	710645216	Lucky Bucky in Oz	Books	1	3	11	N	N	Son Of Ishmael	'Lucky Bucky In Oz' makes it clear that R. Neill's forte as an Oz author was in dramatizing the personal relationships of the Oz royal family; whenever Neill's settings and plot are relatively homey and contained, he excels.  His weakness was in attempting to create the sprawling adventures that most of the titles in the Oz chronicle seem to require.<br /><br />Neill had a talent for forward motion, but almost none for driving home a narrative that relies upon scope, invention, and cliff-hanging suspense to sustain itself. As a result, 'Lucky Bucky In Oz' suffers from the same illness that plagued Neill's second title, 'The Scalawagons Of Oz,' which is unfortunate, since his first Oz title as author, 'The Wonder City Of Oz' is one of the classics in the series.<br /><br />Caught in a tugboat explosion in New York Harbor, young lad Lucky Bucky is pitched high into the stratosphere, eventually landing safely on a volcanic island in the pink sea that borders Ev, the land next to Oz.  Rescued by Davy Jones, a living wooden whale who doubles as a ship, the two new friends decide to travel together to Oz and the Emerald City.<br /><br />Their journey is one of the dullest of several dull journeys which occur in the series; a wooden whale in a desert environment does not portend excellent things ahead, or even suggest good creative sense. Readers are asked to accept that for much of the story the legless Davy makes his way forward over dusty, dry land by slowly \\"wiggling.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the book, Neill creates situations and occasionally whole chapters that are calculated to come to great effect, but which fall flat in every instance.<br /><br />Four notorious Oz witches, a warlock, and twenty Little Wizard simulacrums escape from a magically painted mural in the Emerald Kingdom, but all are dispatched within a few paragraphs.  Lone escapee and classic Oz character Old Mombi flies across Oz and Ev in searching of a hiding place, deciding at last to seek cover under a bed inside the wooden whale.<br /><br />For the greater part of the book, Mombi clearly remains forgotten by the author but not by the reader, who will desperately plead that she get out from under the bunk, jump about, and cause at least some general mayhem (finally remembered at the end, she is corralled by Ozma and Glinda within a matter of seconds, having done no real harm whatsoever).<br /><br />Later, the exhausted Davy sinks in Quad Lake with the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and 100 rambunctious 'uncles' on board, but within a page the whale and everyone else has made their way safely to shore.  When Bucky and Davy find themselves trapped in the underground kingdom of the Gnomes, Number Nine jumps through the Little Wizard's magic mirror machine and frees them before anything exciting can happen.<br /><br />Down the road, lad and whale visit the Scarecrow's Corncob Castle, Oz's largest phallic symbol, but nothing much occurs except a prosaic meeting with the owner and the Tin Woodman.<br /><br />Like Baum, Neill fails to draw inspiration from the role nature plays in his character's lives, reminding readers that bountiful, waves-of-grain Oz is no Arcadia. The Scarecrow's castle appropriately lies among endless corn fields in the yellow Winkie country, but the majestic corn fields get a mere mention, and may as well not even exist; they do not emanate, reverberate, or breathe.<br /><br />As a romantically-conceived fairyland, Baum's Oz was in fact in all ways too far removed from nature and its influence.  Thus Baum's Oz, while poetically imagined, has a mild sub-soil of root rot and decadence under its candy-dipped veneer.<br /><br />Tom, Dick, Harry, and Flummox Gabooch, the family of wind-blowing artificial birds that accompany Bucky and Davy on their journey, are obnoxious, tiresome, and creatively impoverished.<br /><br />Impressive Munchkin boy Number Nine plays a significant role in the story, but since he is almost indistinguishable from Bucky in every way, his inclusion only dilutes the already insubstantial plot.<br /><br />Bucky mentions the Bible story of Jonah and the Whale twice, but his relationship to Davy has no genuinely archetypal underpinnings.<br /><br /> In terms of adventure and opposition, Bucky and Davy are anemically forced to confront and battle a river of talking bubbles, and later, a plain of hostile thigh bones.<br /><br />Guest appearances by Glinda, the Little Wizard, Jenny Jump, Ozma, Dorothy, the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, and Jack Pumpkinhead fail to bring fire, energy, or color to the story.<br /><br />'Lucky Bucky In Oz,' a book readers will want to like, is nonetheless one of the few titles in the series in which readers will feel the desire to skip pages or whole chapters to relieve the drudgery.<br /><br />An unimaginative and poorly conceived failure, the book reads more like a first draft than a finished manuscript, and as such, makes it impossible for the reader to suspend disbelief or become enthusiastically involved in its story.<br /><br />Neill's art is not particularly inspired, except several illustrations of Bucky in which he resembles a jaunty Peter Pan.ry way, his inclusion only dilutes the already insubstantial plot.<br /><br />Bucky mentions the Bible story of Jonah and the Whale twice, but his relationship to Davy has no genuinely archetypal underpinnings.<br /><br /> In terms of adventure and opposition, Bucky and Davy are anemically forced to confront and battle a river of talking bubbles, and later, a plain of hostile thigh bones.<br /><br />Guest appearances by Glinda, the Little Wizard, Jenny Jump, Ozma, Dorothy, the Tin Woodman, the Scarecrow, and Jack Pumpkinhead fail to bring fire, energy, or color to the story.<br /><br />'Lucky Bucky In Oz,' a book readers will want to like, is nonetheless one of the few titles in the series in which readers will feel the desire to skip pages or whole chapters to relieve the drudgery.<br /><br />An unimaginative and poorly conceived failure, the book reads more like a first draft than a finished manuscript, and as such, makes it impossible for the reader to suspend disbelief or become enthusiastically involved in its story.<br /><br />Neill's art is not particularly inspired, except several illustrations of Bucky in which he resembles a jaunty Peter Pan.	2003-01-10

Neill's second authored Oz title, 'The Scalawagons Of Oz,' is a disappointing follow-up to his first, the fully realized 'The Wonder City Of Oz.'  In that book, Neill boldly and ingeniously reinterpreted Oz, making it a friendlier, more madcap place, with none of the unpleasant undercurrents that occasionally surface in the Baum titles.<br /><br />The events in 'The Scalawagons Of Oz' take place one year after those in the previous title, and again feature Munchkin boy Number Nine and partial fairy Jenny Jump as leads.  The Little Wizard has cleverly transformed Jenny from a teenager to a child, and in the process has eliminated the nasty elements in her nature, an act of which Jenny, who has been made a Duchess by Ozma, is unaware.<br /><br />But Jenny still has gumption, an independent nature, fearlessness, and a sense of adventure; thankfully, she doesn't talk like an infant. Spunky Number Nine, now free of the older Jenny's negative influence, is the equal to Baum boy heroes Ojo and Woot, and is here enthusiastically employed as assistant the Little Wizard.<br /><br />A pleasant grouping of Oz inhabitants color the pages: Tik-Tok, the Sawhorse, Ozma, Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Woodman, and Glinda all figure prominently in the narrative.<br /><br />Secondary characters Jellia Jamb, the Hungry Tiger, Jack Pumpkinhead, Aunt Em, the Guardian of the Gate, and the Solider with Green Whiskers make functional guest appearances.  Scraps the Patchwork Girl passes in and out of the story like a Greek chorus, continually commenting on the action and behavior her fellows in her distinct brand of hard-on-the-ear rhyming \\"poetree.\\"  Neill's characterizations, as in 'The Wonder City Of Oz,' are vibrant.<br /><br />There are three definite problems with Neill's story.<br /><br />The opening 60 pages focus on none of the major Oz characters, though the Little Wizard, Number Nine, and Tik-Tok feature briefly.  Instead, readers are introduced to new villain Bell Snickle ('Bellsnickle,' an early German name for St. Nicholas), who breaks into the Wizard's Scalawagon factory, tosses factory manager Tik-Tok out a door and down a mountain, frees the Scalawagons, and then briefly torments the Lolly-Pop Village before disappearing.<br /><br />Bell Snickle, whose sole motivation is to \\"remain mysterious,\\" is the weakest villain in the entire Oz chronicle.  Resembling a deflated whoopee cushion or hot water bottle, Bell Snickle's larger intent is never made clear, and while his appearance is only vaguely described, most of Neill's illustrations of him are clear enough.<br /><br />When the poorly-conceived Bell Snickle, who \\"smells like dried mustard,\\" is finally forced through Jenny's magic turnstile, he comes out the other side looking exactly as he went in, only smaller.<br /><br />Though Neill hints repeatedly that his whoopee cushion appearance is only a disguise, and though Jenny says, \\"Let's see what you really look like,\\" Bell Snickle, who is also called \\"the Rubber Ghost,\\" has the last laugh, as Neill offers no resolution or punch line to the problem Bell Snickle has presented throughout the book.<br /><br />The second major problem is that the Scalawagons--which are a cross between a bumper and a trolley car--barely figure as key components in the story.<br /><br />The Scalawagons are the Little Wizard's new transportation invention, and appear to be at least partial alive; each Scalawagon has a domed top from which 'meat' eyes and a head frequently appear.  None of Scalawagons have individual personalities, and all are incapable of speech and independent action.<br /><br />The Little Wizard and Jenny want to find the lost cars because they are a planned surprise for Ozma, but as elements of the story, Neill completely fails to tap the potential of his nicely designed, turtle-like vehicles.  In anthropomorphic Oz, the Scalawagons have to be the only mute creatures in existence.<br /><br />The volume's third trouble is that the narrative is padded with briefly introduced new creatures and characters that add nothing to the forward motion of the plot; the constantly complaining grandfather clock that accompanies Number Nine throughout is especially irritating.<br /><br />The residents of Lolly-Pop Village may raise a few eyebrows, as the family residing in each of the 6 houses in the village is composed of one 'Lolly'--a little blond girl--and one 'Pop'--a lazy old man who has to lean against the other 'pops' to keep from falling over.<br /><br />Both the Lollies, who do all the work, and the Pops, who loaf all day, are apparently made of hard candy.<br /><br />Midway through the book, Neill makes the suggested father/daughter relationship between the little girl caretakers and the shiftless old men clear, though there are no mature women in sight.<br /><br />Plot threads dangle; Bell Snickle steals Jenny's purse of \\"fairy gifts\\" but does nothing with them, and a mischief-making savage from the Great Waste hides in one of the cars and thus makes his way to the Emerald City, but his misadventures come to little.<br /><br />Overall, the story is badly structured and dull, though the 'present moment' is usually buoyed by Neill's snappy dialogue.<br /><br />Whenever Neill gathers together the extended Oz royal family, the air crackles with tangible Ozian magic.<br /><br />'The Scalawagons Of Oz' lacks the wild imagination and energy of 'The Wonder City Of Oz,' but Neill still surprises with a constant stream of small details and fresh interpretations of the country that will delight new or longtime readers.<br /><br />The forests in the Winkie country literally blink (or 'wink') on and off, and the sky, shade, shadow, and even the skin color of the inhabitants in the particular kingdoms reflect the dominant color of the region.  Much of the action takes place in the Quadling and Gillikin countries, regions not often favored by Oz authors.  As in 'The Wonder City Of Oz,' Jenny's hair is in a different style in every illustration, as befits a style guru, though here her hairstyles have gone from bizarre to tasteful.  Her encounter with fascist spud ruler \\"Dick Tater\\" is hilarious.<br /><br />Overall, 'The Scalawagons Of Oz' is an interesting, often colorful failure, but certainly a must for Oz completists.rrative is padded with briefly introduced new creatures and characters that add nothing to the forward motion of the plot; the constantly complaining grandfather clock that accompanies Number Nine throughout is especially irritating.<br /><br />The residents of Lolly-Pop Village may raise a few eyebrows, as the family residing in each of the 6 houses in the village is composed of one 'Lolly'--a little blond girl--and one 'Pop'--a lazy old man who has to lean against the other 'pops' to keep from falling over.<br /><br />Both the Lollies, who do all the work, and the Pops, who loaf all day, are apparently made of hard candy.<br /><br />Midway through the book, Neill makes the suggested father/daughter relationship between the little girl caretakers and the shiftless old men clear, though there are no mature women in sight.<br /><br />Plot threads dangle; Bell Snickle steals Jenny's purse of \\"fairy gifts\\" but does nothing with them, and a mischief-making savage from the Great Waste hides in one of the cars and thus makes his way to the Emerald City, but his misadventures come to little.<br /><br />Overall, the story is badly structured and dull, though the 'present moment' is usually buoyed by Neill's snappy dialogue.<br /><br />Whenever Neill gathers together the extended Oz royal family, the air crackles with tangible Ozian magic.<br /><br />'The Scalawagons Of Oz' lacks the wild imagination and energy of 'The Wonder City Of Oz,' but Neill still surprises with a constant stream of small details and fresh interpretations of the country that will delight new or longtime readers.<br /><br />The forests in the Winkie country literally blink (or 'wink') on and off, and the sky, shade, shadow, and even the skin color of the inhabitants in the particular kingdoms reflect the dominant color of the region.

A collection of 290 \\"songs, ballads, and ditties,\\" each entry consists of the extended lyrics and \\"complete harmonizations or piano accompaniments.\\"<br /><br />These folk songs are grouped under loose headings such as 'Dreams And Portraits,' 'Pioneer Memories,' 'The Big Brutal City,' 'Picnic and Hayrack Follies, Close Harmony, and Darn Fool Ditties,' 'The Great Open Spaces,' 'Hobo Songs,' and 'Tarnished Love Tales And Revolutionary Antiques,' and 'Mexican Border Songs' among others.<br /><br />Many, understandably, have a British origin--'The Foggy Dew,' 'Barbara Allen,' 'As I Was Walkin' Down Wexford Street,' 'Pretty Polly,' and 'The House Carpenter'--while the origin of others, like 'The E-RI-E,'  'The Ballad Of De Boll Weevil,' and 'The Buffalo Skinners' seem to be distinctly American.<br /><br />'Turkey In The Straw,' however, like \\"When The Curtains Of Night Are Pinned Back,' is a \\"classical American rural tune,\\" and \\"as American as Andrew Jackson, Johnny Appleseed, and Corn-on-the-Cob.\\"<br /><br />Sandburg provides a brief introduction to each song, many of which are informative, while others are humorous and so idiosyncratic that each only muddies the waters of clarity if taken at face value.<br /><br />American music lovers may believe that 'Shenandoah' is a wholly American creation, but Sandburg sensibly suggests that the original may have referred to the name of a foreign ship or an Indian chief, rather than to 'the Historic Virginia valley.'<br /><br />'She'll Be Comin' Round The Mountain\\" was adapted by mountaineers from the \\"old-time negro spiritual\\" 'When The Chariot Comes.' 'The John B. Sails' has its origin in the West Indies.  Sandburg seems to be underscoring the fact that most songs, like most people, come from somewhere else; origins are often hazy and partially a result of wishful thinking.<br /><br />Musicians, educators, and youth leaders should have special interest in this book, which is as pure a piece of Americana as Duncan Emrich's 'Folklore On The American Land.'  'The American Songbag' will also thrill lovers of Americana and those searching for a legitimate, productive, and useful avenue into our country's history.andburg seems to be underscoring the fact that most songs, like most people, come from somewhere else; origins are often hazy and partially a result of wishful thinking.<br /><br />Musicians, educators, and youth leaders should have special interest in this book, which is as pure a piece of Americana as Duncan Emrich's 'Folklore On The American Land.'

Neill's first attempt at authoring a title in the series, 'The Wonder City Of Oz' (1940) has historically been dogged by bad press and negative criticism.<br /><br />General readers and Oz devotees alike should dismiss these criticisms utterly, for 'The Wonder City Of Oz' is not only a delight but in many ways an improvement over Baum's own titles in the series.<br /><br />The tone of 'The Wonder City Of Oz' is less exact, less prim, and less formal than that found in the classic Oz titles; the underlining seriousness in Baum's writing is missing altogether.<br /><br />Neill's Oz is a wackier, looser, and more gregarious place.  Simply put, Neill's Oz is a land where fun predominates; all threats are only paper tigers, something the characters seem to appreciate.<br /><br />Small details, moods, and the 'rules' of the Baum titles are colorfully and imaginatively exaggerated, often greatly so.  Neill's Oz, for instance, is completely anthropomorphic: the houses move, fight, and clean themselves; the kitchen utensils work together to prepare meals and then wash up; the rivers and streams respond to requests for favors.<br /><br />If Scraps the Patchwork Girl had tried her hand at writing an Oz title, 'The Wonder City Of Oz' might have been the result.  Her motto, \\"I Hate Dignity,\\" captures the mood of the book perfectly.<br /><br />Far from losing touch with the Oz established by Baum, Neill's Oz expands the land's horizons considerably.<br /><br />Fans of the early titles may find Neill's Candy Land-like approach somewhat gushing and literally and figuratively syrupy, but Neill establishes the elements of his narrative precisely, writes with a fully confident tone, and has clearly enjoyed stretching Oz's rules, regulations, and boundaries.<br /><br />Neill, unlike Baum, exploits every scene and character to their fullest potential.  In 'The Wonder City Of Oz,' every facet of the narrative sparkles continuously without ever becoming overly familiar, tiresome, or repetitive. Baum's Oz was ultimately a land that was romantic in conception, but Neill's Oz is a boisterous, slightly vulgar, happy circus that never closes, one to which admission is always free.<br /><br />Alice, Pinocchio and the Blue Fairy, Mr. Toad, Pooh and Christopher Robin, Peter Pan, Mary Poppins, Raggedy Anne, the Snow Queen, and the Cat in the Hat would not only feel at home in Neill's Oz, but could be smoothly folded into the story with ease and without the slightest ripple of discontinuity.<br /><br />While enjoying 'The Wonder City Of Oz,' readers will almost expect these classic characters to make at least a brief appearance in the Emerald City, the 'Wonder City' of the title.  Neill's Oz is an all-inclusive fairyland.<br /><br />The fast-moving plot is better than any found in the Baum titles, and lacks the repetitious elements often found among the classics.<br /><br />Jenny Jump, a teenager living in New Jersey, catches a Leprechaun stealing her pepper cheese and demands a wish in return for his freedom. The leprechaun, Sico Pompus ('psychopomp'), agrees to transform her into a fairy, but thinks better of it half way through the process, leaving Jenny with some fairy body parts while the rest remain stubbornly human.<br /><br />Jumping out the window in pursuit of the escaping Sico, Jenny finds herself uncontrollably able to jump great distances on her one fairy foot, and lands, after days of traveling through the air, in the Emerald City.<br /><br />Jenny is a well-intentioned girl, but also somewhat spoiled, ill-tempered, headstrong, and thoughtless.<br /><br />When Princess Ozma politely introduces herself as the ruler of Oz, Jenny immediately questions the voting practices of the kingdom.<br /><br />Ozma realizes that in fact there has never been an election, and decides it might be entertaining for everyone if one were held. The book's main plot revolves around the resulting 'ozlection,' with the irritable Jenny running as Ozma's competition. When Jenny discovers a magic 'turn-style' which completely transforms the appearance of those who pass through it, she opens a business, and rapidly gains popularity among the city's inhabitants, who are thrilled with the turnstile's never-before-seen, fairly avant garde designs. Thus votes for Jenny rapidly accumulate.<br /><br />The cast of the book is spectacular: beloved characters the Patchwork Girl, Jack Pumpkinhead, Ozma, Dorothy, the Little Wizard, and the Sawhorse actively participate in the narrative, in addition to new characters Jenny Jump, Sico Pompus, and requisite Munchkin boy hero Number Nine. Tik-Tok, Professor Wooglebug, Ojo, Kabumpo, and the Scarecrow make brief appearances, but are believably always just around the corner or down the street.<br /><br />As critics have noted, the characterizations of the classic Oz inhabitants are not exact, but this is a positive rather than a negative factor, as the restraint with which Baum portrayed his creations in book after book often numbed and hobbled them.<br /><br />Loyalists to Baum and Thompson tend to ignore the fact that several of their titles are boring, formulaic, and completely uneventful.  The continuous stream of quips, puns, and jokes in 'The Wonder City Of Oz' are delightful even when not particularly clever, since it is clear Neill is playing with and teasing his audience, a game readers will appreciate.<br /><br />If Neill's puns are not always funny, the fact that he continues to make them is. But successful humor does run through 'The Wonder City Of Oz' like an electric current.<br /><br />Readers familiar with second Oz title, 'The Marvelous Land Of Oz,' and all the books that followed know that Neill was one of the greatest, most imaginative American illustrators of the 20th century, capable of simultaneously integrating both innovative and traditional elements into his drawings. Thus it should be no great surprise that such creativity also found an outlet in several of his four Oz novels.<br /><br />The abundant illustrations in 'The Wonder City Of Oz' are suitably less romantic than his illustrations the Baum-penned entries, but, while looser, are just as otherworldly.able Jenny running as Ozma's competition.

P. Lovecraft, who championed Blackwood's work throughout his lifetime, Blackwood loved, admired, and respected nature: Blackwood was a romantic who enjoyed a mystical faith and philosophy concerning the natural world, a faith which is reflected in almost all of his stories.<br /><br />In his tales, trees and men fall in love with one another, fairies happily guide, misguide, or torment intrusive travelers, and other-dimensional creatures storm earth through gaps in reality or plunge down on hunters from the heavens. Even Blackwood's ghost stories typically suggest some mysterious law connecting the return of the dead with natural but little understood processes.  Few writers other than Arthur Machen could portray 'daimonic reality' as well and as believably as Blackwood. But while The Centaur broadly addresses the supernatural, it is in no way a horror tale.<br /><br />When traveler O'Malley encounters an unusually robust, handsome, and virile man and his equally attractive young son while on a cruise, he becomes strangely enraptured, and is thrilled to learn that the two will be sharing his cabin for the duration of the voyage.<br /><br />O'Malley also notices that when observing the two men from a distance, they seem to oddly amalgamate into one larger being, or, at other times, an immense third presence seems to accompany them. Is it a trick of the light? Is O'Malley a lunatic, hallucinating, or experiencing repressed homosexual desire without realization?<br /><br />Since both father and son rarely speak and communicate largely with their charismatic smiles, pie-eyed O'Malley makes of them what he can and takes them in with his eyes a little more than seems respectable for a presumably heterosexual male: at night, O'Malley goes so far as to pull back the curtains and stare at their undressed bodies while they sleep.<br /><br />In one loaded episode, the father awakens to find O'Malley bending over him and devouring him with his eyes; unperturbed, the father sits up, points to the son, and together they stare at the son's naked chest beautifully rising and falling as the morning light comes up.<br /><br />Since everything suggests that O'Malley is erotically attracted to both men, and the father in some way enamored with his son, their cabin seems more like a blissful, somewhat humid den of unthwarted pedophilia and incest than the place of revelation and miracles Blackwood would like to have the reader believe it is.<br /><br />Also along for the voyage is the learned Dr. Stahl, who inexplicably has a great understanding of the two strangers and what they threaten.<br /><br />Blackwood allows himself almost a hundred labored and repetitive pages attempting to convey to the reader the secret Dr. Stahl attempts to put into words for O'Malley. The father and the son, as it happens, are not men in the sense that Stahl and O'Malley are men, but are earth spirits, emanations of mother nature, and, as such, two of the last beings of their kind in existence.<br /><br />Blackwood never finds the words to define and describe the two men's metaphysical nature clearly, so Dr. Stahl and O'Malley repeat the same precious discussion over and over, merely approaching it from a slightly different angle each time.<br /><br />As a struggling, often starving writer, Blackwood was frequently paid by the word, a fact that hasn't been forgotten by his critics.<br /><br />Many of his stories were indeed overwritten, though overwriting was something Blackwood raised almost to an art in many of his short pieces. Unfortunately, his novels, from 'A Prisoner In Fairyland' to 'The Centaur,' were another matter.<br /><br />Had 'The Centaur' been a short story of twenty pages, Blackwood could have conveyed exactly the same information, if, as written, to an equally unconvincing effect.  In trying to outline his beliefs about the spiritual aspects of nature, Blackwood abandoned structure entirely and seemed to forget that he was attempting a dramatic narrative. Readers can obtain a much better outline of Blackwood's pantheistic philosophy by reading his short stories than can ever be obtained by reading 'The Centaur,' which is ultimately nothing but a vague, under confident, and winded New Age tract.<br /><br />Blackwood's short masterpiece, \\"May Day Eve,\\" concerns a hardheaded traveler's uncomfortable but apparently necessary encounter with the fairies, beautifully expressing everything that 'The Centaur' attempts and fails to say.<br /><br />When the narrator, having suffered his illuminating but disorienting punishment in the wild, finally arrives at the friendly professor's door, the knowing professor shelters him briefly before tempting him with the knowledge that they have several hours of darkness yet to experience the miracles of the fairy world.  Armed with the security his companion provides and a sudden new and courageous attitude about the possibilities inherent in reality, the narrator accepts the professor's invitation, and they disappear together into the night.  He says, \\"And as we began to climb the hill together in silence I saw that the stars were clear overhead and that there was no mist, that the trees stood motionless without wind, and that beyond us on the summit of the hills there were lights dancing to and for, appearing and disappearing like the reflections of stars in water.\\"itten, to an equally unconvincing effect.

Frank Baum's spectacularly illustrated 'Little Wizard Stories Of Oz' (1914), written for a younger audience than the books in the official Oz series, are the perfect introduction to Baum's utopist fairyland.<br /><br />Containing characters not only from 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' but from the second and third titles, 'The Marvelous Land Of Oz' and 'Ozma Of Oz,' the one hundred and sixty-nine page volume is composed of six short pieces, each teaming two of Baum's most popular Oz inhabitants.<br /><br />While the stories are delightful and comic, a subtle lesson in common sense or ethics subtly underscores each.  At about twenty-four pages a piece, these narratives make excellent bedtime stories; each moves quickly and can be reread over and over (adults can read the entire book in about an hour).<br /><br />Readers already familiar with the other Oz titles will find that the Little Wizard stories fit right into the fairyland's established history and continuity.  John R. Neill's extraordinary talent as an illustrator has rarely been put to better use than it has been here; his drawings are brightly colored and full of atmosphere, detail, and humor.<br /><br />In 'The Cowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger,' the two talking beasts, tired of passively guarding the never-threatened Ozma at her throne, decide to competitively test their animal natures.<br /><br />In 'Jack Pumpkinhead and the Sawhorse,' Jack, who lives in a pumpkin patch so he can easily replace his head as needed, finds himself in the Winkie country, disastrously without a spare.<br /><br />In 'The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman,' the later topples overboard while the two are out adventuring in a giant corncob boat.  The Scarecrow, stuffed with straw, tries to reach his comrade but finds he can only float on the surface.<br /><br />Each of the six stories contains an element of threat to which the primary or secondary characters react with fear or dismay.<br /><br />'Little Dorothy' and Toto, carelessly straying too far from home, are kidnapped by the size-shifting giant Crinklink; Tik-Tok the Clockwork Man finds his metal body broken to pieces by a blow from the angry Nome King's mace; and Ozma and the 'Little Wizard' find themselves beset by three mischievous, seemingly undefeatable goblins.<br /><br />In typically clever fashion, Baum quickly disarms those elements which might frighten younger children or be a cause of concern for adults.<br /><br />The Hungry Tiger decides he wants to eat a 'fat baby' to prove his bestial nature, and the Cowardly Lion, not to be outdone, says he's going to 'rip a person to shreds,' but no baby-devouring is ever accomplished.  At their first sight of a little lost girl, the Tiger and Lion compete over who can come to her aid first and best, their original boasting intentions entirely forgotten.<br /><br />The book's humor is dry and the outright jokes well-paced to about one a story.  The Tin Woodman, for instance, lying helpless on the bottom of a lake and waiting to be rescued, says to the frustrated Scarecrow and their bird helpers, \\"Hurry up, please.  You've no idea how damp it is down here.\\"<br /><br />'The Little Wizard Stories Of Oz' are so engaging and charming that adults will enjoy reading them for their own pleasure, and enjoy reading them again to children.<br /><br />Full of other-worldly imagination and pep, the book can be used for teaching and group discussion, or strictly for entertainment.straying too far from home, are kidnapped by the size-shifting giant Crinklink; Tik-Tok the Clockwork Man finds his metal body broken to pieces by a blow from the angry Nome King's mace; and Ozma and the 'Little Wizard' find themselves beset by three mischievous, seemingly undefeatable goblins.<br /><br />In typically clever fashion, Baum quickly disarms those elements which might frighten younger children or be a cause of concern for adults.<br /><br />The Hungry Tiger decides he wants to eat a 'fat baby' to prove his bestial nature, and the Cowardly Lion, not to be outdone, says he's going to 'rip a person to shreds,' but no baby-devouring is ever accomplished.

Frank Baum's 'The Tin Woodman Of Oz' is one of the more engaging novels in the famous series. When restless boy hero Woot The Wanderer happens upon the Tin Woodman's palace in the yellow Winkie country and learns of the emperor's origin and history, his question concerning the fate of Tin Woodman's one-time Munchkin fianc&eacute;, Nimmie Amee, spontaneously hatches a plot to discover her fate.<br /><br />Joined by the Scarecrow, the three set out on a journey through the amazing and perilous kingdoms of Oz. Uninvited, the three unwisely enter a castle in the purple Gillikin country and are captured by its giant resident, Mrs. Yoop. There they find old friend Polychrome, daughter of the rainbow, already imprisoned and transformed into a canary for the sorceress's amusement.<br /><br />Yookoohoo sorceress Mrs. Yoop, placid and regal, is one of Baum's more terrifying villains, showing as she does an undiluted sociopathic and amoral indifference to the fates of others, who she physically manipulates to suit her fancies.<br /><br />Beautiful and poised, Mrs. Yoop, who lives alone in a dead valley, uses her spell-casting talents to provide herself with sustenance; water, pebbles, and bundles of weeds become coffee, 'fish-balls,' and buttered biscuits with a wave of her hand. When Mrs. Yoop tells the journeyers she is unpleased with their present forms and will transform them to her liking in the morning, the unsubtle suggestion that they may be her next meal is clear.<br /><br />Mrs. Yoop is not only one in a long line of fairytale cannibal giants, but her gigantism and prim, coldly polite manners make clear she is also a figurative as well as a literal devouring mother.<br /><br />Archetypal motifs abound throughout, their subtexts driving the narrative and creating its sometime disturbing moods and moments. Woot magically degenerates into a green monkey, a form the text makes clear he finds atavistically embarrassing and unpleasant. In a scene fairly brazen for several reasons, agricultural demi-god the Scarecrow sacrifices his body to gain the gorge-spanning services of a straw-eating monster for his companions, only to be imperfectly 'resurrected' on the far side.<br /><br />The recounting of the Tin Woodman's slow transformation from a healthy Munchkin male into a man of tin underscores the multiple amputations that necessitated the slow replacement of his human limbs with those of metal, allowing Baum free reign to discourse on the nature of identity, though the theme of violence goes undressed.<br /><br />The book might have been called 'The Tin Woodmen Of Oz,' as by its second half there are two tin men, original Winkie king Nick Chopper and a second, soldier Captain Fyter, who was also once a man and became metal through exactly the same violent process.<br /><br />Both 'tin twins' have courted Nimmie Amee, and both been plagued by the Wicked Witch of the West in the period before Dorothy's house dropped upon her from the sky.<br /><br />It's doubtful that readers of the series ever wondered whatever became of Nick Chopper's 'meat' limbs after they were severed from his body, but this volume answers that question.<br /><br />Together with those of Captain Fyter, the mismatched limbs have been magically glued back together to create errant oddball homunculus Chopfyt, who, perhaps not unreasonably, is aggressive and ill-tempered.<br /><br />Where does Nick Chopper's humanity and being begin and end? The question comes in for special consideration when, revisiting his place of transformation from human to tin, he discovers his ungroomed human head alive, listless, and able to speak in a blacksmith's cabinet.<br /><br />Which of these creatures, if any, has a right to Nimmie Amee's hand in marriage? Has Nick, limited to a kind but not a loving heart, a right to invite her to become his bride and the Empress of the Winkies if he can only offer her dutiful companionship?<br /><br />Baum was unusually sensitive to the details and nuances of his plots, but here unaccountably overlooks a change of gender.<br /><br />Since Mrs. Yoop's strange Yookoohoo magic cannot be changed or undone by even the most powerful forces in Oz, Ozma, the land's fairy ruler, once a boy herself, comes to the conclusion that the stalwart Woot can only regain his original young man's form if another Ozian creature agrees to take on the form of the green monkey.<br /><br />Since readers are led to believe that Woot as the green monkey is still a male, Baum trips himself up when a female character is tricked into assuming the monkey's form.<br /><br />Baum fails to acknowledge that she has not only unhappily regressed into a beast, but now also inhabits a male body.<br /><br />In an interesting expository section, Oz Royal Historian Baum provides the reader with new facets of Oz's history and its magical rules and regulations.<br /><br />Once a part of the larger world, Oz, which has always been surrounded by an impassable desert, was enchanted by \\"the fairy band of Queen Lurline\\" sometime in the distant past.<br /><br />From that moment, no one has ever died or grown older in Oz.

US	35944741	R214K0M974M2GD	0688149758	123589421	The Lost Princess of Oz (Books of Wonder)	Books	2	18	22	N	N	Small Dogs In Tall Grass	While charming enough to delight children, 'The Lost Princess Of Oz' (1917) is not one of the more exceptional books in L. Frank Baum's Oz series.<br /><br />The problem lies with both writer and illustrator; Baum's cast of characters has been poorly chosen, and John R. Neill's usually masterful, visionary illustrations are in many cases merely serviceable.<br /><br />The book features four child protagonists--Dorothy, Trot, Betsy Bobbin, and lone male Button-Bright--which is three interchangeable child protagonists too many (in several chapters, Trot and Betsy, though ostensibly present, do not speak and play no part in the action).<br /><br />As in most of the Oz books, the plot revolves around a journey, and those chosen in this case to undertake the search for the kidnapped Ozma are simply too bland a group.<br /><br />Colorful eccentrics the Woogle Bug and Jack Pumpkinhead are missing, and while Scraps the Patchwork Girl is included, she ambles about on the periphery of the story for most of the book with little sign of her trademark intrusive spark and spunk.<br /><br />There are also too many talking animals--whether of 'meat' or magical origin--the Cowardly Lion, Hank the Mule, Toto, the Woozy, and the Sawhorse (and later, the Big Lavender Bear and the Small Pink Bear).<br /><br />Though several interesting conversations arise from their differing philosophical viewpoints, the characters--which also include the 'Little Wizard' of the original title--are portrayed too homogeneously, and thus the tension and flair usually found in Baum's stories and dialogue are absent.<br /><br />Baum does score with the introduction to the series of the Frogman, a fun, imaginative character rivaling the Woogle Bug, the Gnome King, Tik-Tok, and Jack Pumpkinhead in pleasant absurdity, vibrance, and potential.<br /><br />But Baum's descriptive portrayal of his fairyland is sadly pedestrian throughout, as if these as-yet undiscovered kingdoms in the marvelous landscape of Oz are simply to be taken for granted.<br /><br />All of which may explain Neill's largely uninspired, functional illustrations. Neill's usual genius is almost entirely missing, though careful readers may notice the dramatic and humorous illustration of the wizard standing before a walled city, addressing the heads of numerous giants who stare him down from the other side.  All are grisly, bearded, and fierce, except one, who resembles a breathless, slightly overweight, slightly effete matinee idol of the period. Another chapter features a mechanical, jeweled dragon, which Neill inexplicably ignores.<br /><br />Baum surprises with a hilarious scene in which the traveling assembly is anxiously ushered past a gauntlet of giants to meet a king rumored for his cruelty, only to find him delicately combing his eyelashes.<br /><br />The evidence and subtext in 'The Lost Princess Of Oz' suggest, as many other titles in the series do, that women are by far the stronger and more spiritually-refined sex.<br /><br />The Wizard is a well-known humbug, the Lion is a coward, the Frogman is a pompous fabricator, and Button-Bright, in behavior and dress, is in no way significantly different from Dorothy, Betsy, and Trot, who form a kind of juvenile triple-faced goddess.<br /><br />Glinda the Good, Oz's lone sorceress, and Ozma, the kingdom's child ruler, are strong, wise, and fundamentally incapable of error or even ungracious behavior.  The Patchwork Girl is clever and indomitable under any circumstance.<br /><br />Was Baum slyly poking fun at his adult audience and critics?  Considering Neill's strangely out-of-place, sissy-faced giant, is it an accident that the kingdom of the bears is ruled by the Big Lavender Bear and his constant companion, the sooth-saying Little Pink Bear?<br /><br />Adults desiring to introduce children to the Oz series should start with the first three books, 'The Wizard of Oz,' the better 'The Marvelous Land Of Oz,' the often bizarre 'Ozma Of Oz,' and then progress through the rest of the titles.<br /><br />'Little Wizard Stories Of Oz,' beautifully illustrated and colored by Neill, and specifically written for a younger audience than the regular titles, is also an excellent choice.<br /><br />The optimistic series, with its beautiful evocation of a better world and happier days, are perfect for today's children, who, as the success of the Harry Potter books show, are starved for imaginative, magical, and archetypal fare.ress through the rest of the titles.<br /><br />'Little Wizard Stories Of Oz,' beautifully illustrated and colored by Neill, and specifically written for a younger audience than the regular titles, is also an excellent choice.<br /><br />The optimistic series, with its beautiful evocation of a better world and happier days, are perfect for today's children, who, as the success of the Harry Potter books show, are starved for imaginative, magical, and archetypal fare.	2002-12-12

While less overtly funny than 'Tobacco Road' and less moving than 'God's Little Acre,' 'Journeyman' remains a small, tightly controlled masterpiece well in keeping with its more famous predecessors, and is no more shocking than either.<br /><br />A stranger arrives in the hot, sleepy, Georgia agricultural community of Rocky Comfort, driving up to Clay Horey's farm in a dying automobile, the sound of grinding gears and a cloud of billowing black smoke announcing his arrival. Clay, as easily molded and manipulated as his name suggests, isn't sure whether he sees a man emerging from the car or not, and briefly believes he's hallucinating. Buzzards are \\"soaring motionless overhead,\\" and bluejays sweep from the woods in a flurry \\"as if they've discovered a snake in a tree.\\" For a moment, the natural laws of the physical world have been suspended and oddly skewed. Clay's visitor is preacher Semon Dye (Semon/Die = Life/Death?), an apparently down on his luck wayfarer in dirty black clothing and a face charred brown from the smoke.<br /><br />Through the use of blatant but nonetheless effective and smartly executed symbolism, Caldwell makes it quite clear what sort of spiritual being Semon Dye is. He tells Clay he \\"feels horny,\\" and intimidates Clay into action by jabbing at him repeatedly with a pitchfork. Readers will quickly notice that Semon is the prototype of Harry Powell, the preacher played by Robert Mitchum in the 1955 film 'Night Of The Hunter.' Semon, \\"about 50\\" and nothing less than 6 feet 8 inches tall, is also a magnetically sexual predator and personality, using his continuously evident \\"huge stiff thumb\\" to stab Clay between the ribs (a metaphorical act of 'sticking it to him,' as he soon will), and attracting women \\"like flocks of sheep.\\"<br /><br />\\"He's the potentest thing,\\" says 15 year-old child bride Dene more than once, to Clay's chagrin.<br /><br />Semon sets about seducing everyone he meets literally or figuratively, quietly taking over gullible, torpid Clay's farm and life one piece at a time. Even when one male character says he'd \\"like to blow Semon's brains out,\\" he also admits momentarily that he misses Dye's presence and being \\"tickled\\" by both his big stiff thumb and company. One woman, though just violently pistol whipped into unconsciousness by the preacher, nonetheless agrees to travel with him the following week.<br /><br />But Rocky Comfort is already in a fallen state before Semon arrives. The only local church has been converted into a guano shed; Clay is married to current wife and teenager Dene, but hasn't divorced his previous and fourth wife, Lorene Horey, who appears in town uninvited and who literally acts out her surname by settling happily down to a life of prostitution; Clay's only child, uncontrollable 6 year -old Vearl, is living with a syphilis infection he inexplicably contracted in his fourth year; Lorene, one of the stronger personalities in the book, constantly harasses Clay or Susan to take her son Vearl to a doctor for treatment, but doesn't lift a finger to do so herself; and Clay, though he's had a bottle of medicine for the boy for two years, has yet to give Vearl even a spoonful.<br /><br />In an original, hilarious, and daring scene, Caldwell has Clay, Semon, and neighbor Tom lightly fighting over and becoming addicted to peeping through a \\"slit\\" in the back wall of Tom's cowshed at the barbed wire fence and beautiful, lush woodland stretching beyond it. This slit, \\"the [word deleted--ed.] little slit I ever saw in all my life,\\" as Tom calls it, presents an opportunity for the characters not only to peer directly into nature's sprawling, all encompassing vulva, but to simultaneously glimpse through it the only pure, untouchable, incorruptible world they'll ever know, that which exists forever beyond the 'barbed wire fence' of their own animal state of lust and gross stupidity.<br /><br />Passing a neighborly jug of 'corn' whiskey, the three briefly fall into a state of peace and understanding with one another. Even while competing and tricking one another for access to the hole, they spontaneously empathize with each other's need to peer through it again and again. The unfallen, Eden-like natural world they see on the other side, but which is directly perceivable only through the magic slit, is a vision of paradise that briefly unites them. Thus the male gaze meets nature's maw at eye level, with happy results for all.<br /><br />When Semon clamorously preaches to the community in the local school house at night, his true nature manifests again not only in his rage but in the sudden appearance of the black flies, June bugs, mud daubers, wasps and biting red ants that swarm into the building.<br /><br />Ostensibly attempting to raise the population spiritually by forcing them to admit and reject their sins and torrid natures, Semon finally reduces the assembly  by torchlight to sweating, barely clothed, hysterically orgasmic serpents, slithering on their stomachs, speaking gibberish, and twining themselves around one another and around the desks meant for presumably innocent school children. Only prostitute and sexual sophisticate Lorene, \\"the biggest sinner\\" in Semon's eyes, consciously rejects the preacher's spell, sitting in the back of the room in horrified, disgusted, but unconverted astonishment.<br /><br />'Journeyman' appears to be about man's casual indifference at grasping and preventing the pitfalls of cause and effect, and about his inability to learn the lesson of even his most frightful, painful, and harrowing experiences.

US	35944741	R2BATIMOUNT248	0553212702	287583721	The House of the Seven Gables (Bantam Classics)	Books	2	19	26	N	N	Hawthorne's Six-And-A-Half-Gable Surplus	Nathaniel Hawthorne's 'The House of the Seven Gables' today enjoys unshakable status as one of the brighter stars in the firmament of American literature.  Though praised by Hermann Melville, Edgar Allen Poe, and other respected authors and critics at the time of its publication in 1851, many of today's readers may question the novel's reputation for greatness.  Was it one of the first substantial novels by an American author?  Where Americans of the era, tired of bowing to European cultural tradition, hungry for a literary hero of their own? Undoubtedly.  Coming more than twenty years after the bright, crisp style of Washington Irving, the regressive 'House of the Seven Gables' reads like the kind of tiresome classic many people dread being forced to confront in higher education classes, for the book feels more like the product of the 18th rather than the 19th century. Like the balance of Irving's short stories, 'The House of the Seven Gables' is set a century earlier than the period in which it was written, thus making comparisons with Irving even more difficult to ignore.<br /><br />The major problem with 'The House of the Seven Gables' is that its story could be told by a shrewder and less indulgent author in one tenth of its 268 somnolent pages.  Hawthorne worked within the framework of a specifically chosen plot and theme, yet the novel, taken page by page, appears to be about almost nothing: there seem to be vacuums between the words, voids between the sentences, gulfs between the paragraphs. Hawthorne considered this work a romance, and there are some suitably gothic shadows, but, if in fact a romance, 'The House of the Seven Gables' is the flattest major romance in Western literature. Though its plot elements include a corrupt judge, accusations of witchcraft, the hanging of a sorcerer, a poisoned well, and a murderous, disembodied hand, the tone throughout is tepid and airless.<br /><br />Structurally, the novel is disastrous.  Elderly Hepzibah Pyncheon, one of the last members of a declining New England family, is opening a small penny goods shop on the lower floor of the seven-gabled house in which she lives in solitude.  Now financially destitute, Hepzibah bravely faces down her elitist illusions concerning her family's social superiority when she realizes how completely present the wolf is at her door.<br /><br />After a turgid history of the righteous Pyncheons of Salem in chapter one, the second concerns itself only with an account of Hepzibah's fumbling attempts to open the shop on its first day of business.  In the third chapter--\\"The First Customer\\"--Hepzibah encounters her first customer.  By the close of the fourth, \\"A Day Behind The Counter,\\" readers find themselves on the book's 56th page, almost one-fifth of the book, and still passing the time unproductively with Hepzibah in the shop on its opening day.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Hepzibah's protracted confrontation with reality is the strongest part of the book, Hepzibah being by far the most distinctive of the characters within its pages.  But Hepzibah soon fades into the background, taking away with her what little drama exists; none follows.<br /><br />In a later chapter, Hawthorne spends 6,352 words coyly conveying to the reader that an apparently sleeping man is not sleeping, but dead, something the reader has already guessed after completing the first of the many hammering paragraphs to follow.<br /><br />Winded passages like \\"You hear the ticking of his watch; his breath you do not hear. A most refreshing slumber, doubtless! And yet he cannot be asleep. His eyes are open!\\" and \\"an infinite, inscrutable blackness has annihilated sight!  Where is our universe?  All crumbled away from us; and we, adrift in chaos, may hearken to the gusts of homeless wind, that go sighing and murmuring about, in a quest for what was once a world!\\" abound.<br /><br />Hawthorne was fond of exclamation points and short of self-discipline.  It could be argued that Hawthorne was simply layering his prose with multiple crosshatches of irony, sarcasm, and satire, but, if so, Hawthorne, here already a king with no clothes, only doubly underscores his shortcomings as a prose stylist.<br /><br />Readers of Hawthorne's third novel, the punishing 'The Blithedale Romance' (1952), or his short stories 'My Kinsman, Major Molineux' and 'The May-Pole of Merrymount' know how willfully vague and turgid Hawthorne's work can be. His reputation today is probably some combination of accident of birth, proximity to high society, uncritical alliance to literary tradition, and the fact that his suffering prose style is interpreted by the pretentious or uneducated as evidence of highbrow genius.  In truth, Hawthorne simply did not prove himself a very good writer in most of his work, regardless of the grandiosity of his themes or their genuine relevance to American history.<br /><br />In an often reprinted essay, Hawthorne scholar Newton Arvin argued that Hawthorne's dominant theme was the 'prideful sin' of \\"cultivating the intellect at the expense of the sympathies,\\" a phenomena which is generally understood to have been particularly commonplace in Puritan-rooted New England.  However, Alvin, who clearly empathizes with Hawthorne on this point, fails to acknowledge that sympathy for others, whether sincere or unconsciously affected, can as readily become a source of sinful' pride as the intellect or any other human capacity.<br /><br />Hawthorne, whose best work is found in his simply written short works such as 'Feathertop: A Moralized Legend' and 'Young Goodman Brown,' in addition to his two books for children, 'A Wonder Book' and 'Tanglewood Tales,' was an intelligent man of strong emotion, and it was there, in his dominant feeling function, that he understandably forged his creative work.<br /><br />Those seriously pursuing a study of general Americana, American literature, or the history of New England should read 'The House of the Seven Gables,' and perhaps visit the lovely site of the actual house in Salem, Massachusetts.  For everyone else except the masochistically curious, the novel is unessential reading.s of irony, sarcasm, and satire, but, if so, Hawthorne, here already a king with no clothes, only doubly underscores his shortcomings as a prose stylist.

Frank Baum: Creator of Oz' is an excellent biography of the American writer, one that should generate new interest and encourage further scholarly research on this neglected and still underrated American author.<br /><br />A decent, hardworking, and ambitious gentleman, Baum (1856-1919), who all thought \\"exceptionally sweet-natured and easy-going,\\" lived a full and adventurous life, even in his later years, when most of his adventuring took place in his colorful and far-reaching imagination. The confident, plainspoken Baum, an epitome of civility, was a modest Renaissance man, almost something of a wizard himself.<br /><br />Before discovering his talent for writing children's books and creating Oz, the young Baum worked as a an actor, a playwright, an oil salesman, a \\"frontier\\" storekeeper, a newspaper editor and a publisher. Later, he was also the producer of `radio plays' and, in the very early days of cinema, films based on his Oz creations. Happily chasing rainbows, Baum moved from one part of the country to another as the spirit and his intuition moved him.<br /><br />Married to the daughter of suffragist leader Matilda Gage, Baum was an active and life-long supporter of women's rights. As Rogers clearly shows, the free-thinking Baum never ruled the roost in his own home; domineering, no-nonsense, feet-on-the-ground wife Maud consistently provided the necessary ballast that kept their home, finances, and Baum's career afloat.<br /><br />In one hilarious episode, Baum makes the mistake of enthusiastically introducing a dozen donuts to the household; for daring to insult her cooking, pantry, and shopping habits, Baum is browbeaten and given a chilly reception for a full week, until he comes to understand that he's \\"not to buy any food whatsoever unless asked to get it\\" by his wife.<br /><br />From the early days of their marriage, Baum comes to understand that \\"around the house,\\" Maud \\"is the boss.\\" When their very young son cheerfully throws the family cat out the second story window, Maud dangles the child from the same window as the neighbors watch on in horror, an incident the boy never forgot. As Rogers points out, Oz was a matriarchy.<br /><br />Never very close to his own mother, who frowned on his \\"disregard for conventional religion,\\" both Baum and Maud were devoted adherents of Theosophy, another of Matilda Gage's intellectual interests. In Theosophy, Rogers says, Baum found a belief system and a vision \\"of the cosmos in which physical and spiritual reality were part of one great whole, filled with beings seen and unseen,\\" one that was to bear fruit for Baum in his numerous fairy books.  Rogers believes that the reason both his fairies and fairylands are \\"so concretely realized\\" is because Baum honestly believed fairies \\"had spiritual or subjective reality.\\"<br /><br />In her introduction, Rogers, who was devoted the Oz books as a child, relates her dismay in finding, as new college English instructor in 1958, that the Oz books were not taught by \\"responsible teachers,\\" who only taught \\"good\\" children's literature, something Rogers equates with \\"literary pretension.\\"<br /><br />As recently as 1994, Rogers says, the books were rejected for their \\"blandness,\\" which suggests that the author of that study, scholar Gillian Avery, had either bad taste, dead senses, no imagination, or simply hadn't read the series.<br /><br />Rogers provides the minimum of a brief synopsis for each of the Oz books, as well as for each title in Baum's numerous other fictional series for children, including The Boy Fortune Hunters, Mary Louise, and Aunt Jane's Nieces.<br /><br />Roger's 22-page analysis of the first and most famous book, 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,' is exceptional; even the most devoted Oz enthusiast will find something new in her discussion.<br /><br />Comparing Dorothy and Carroll's Alice, Rogers find Dorothy the more admirable role model, as \\"responsible, self-reliant, brave, sensible, honest,and self-confident\\" Dorothy is \\"able to make sense of the confusing world she is plunged into,\\" and \\"can act effectively and resist unreasonable authority.\\"<br /><br />Rogers illustrates how the laws of the land of Oz illustrate the values of self-accepting individuality, self-respect, respect for others, and equality; how the book teaches \\"a wholesome practical morality through examples.\\" She notes that Oz has only female witches, all of who bear real power, while the lone wizard is a powerless humbug and a fraud.<br /><br />Referencing Baum's earlier how-to-decorate book, 'The Shop Window,' Rogers underscores Baum's principle that while misleading people is wrong, it's an almost necessary evil, as people demand \\"gratification of impossible wishes.\\" Thus the Wizard's Emerald City is largely an illusion, as are his hopeful solutions to the Scarecrow's, Lion's, and Tin Woodman's problems; \\"how can I help being a humbug...when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can't be done?\\"<br /><br />Rogers places the book in its proper historical fairytale context, and, in an accurate, happily non-politically correct psychoanalytical passage, claims that Dorothy is allowed \\"the opportunity, enviable to any child, of killing the bad mother without guilt.\\" Rogers also interprets 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' within the context of its Americanism and the age in which it was written, and provides the etiology of the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman.<br /><br />Later chapters contain extended, equally interesting interpretations of the Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead, the sex-changing Tip, Ozma, the Woogle Bug, both Nome Kings, Tik-Tok, Scraps the Patchwork Girl, even Billina, the cantankerous hen.  Fans of both W.W. Denslow and John R. Neill will find the sections discussing each highly satisfying.<br /><br />Rogers' writing is confident, crisp, detailed, and clear. Her touch is light but thorough throughout.  She clearly loves her subject, about which she has a ready sense of humor.  The left-handed Baum was 'the Royal Historian of Oz,' and with 'L. Frank Baum: Creator of Oz,' Rogers has become Baum's own Royal Historian, a position too long vacant, and now gracefully filled.and self-confident\\" Dorothy is \\"able to make sense of the confusing world she is plunged into,\\" and \\"can act effectively and resist unreasonable authority.\\"<br /><br />Rogers illustrates how the laws of the land of Oz illustrate the values of self-accepting individuality, self-respect, respect for others, and equality; how the book teaches \\"a wholesome practical morality through examples.\\" She notes that Oz has only female witches, all of who bear real power, while the lone wizard is a powerless humbug and a fraud.<br /><br />Referencing Baum's earlier how-to-decorate book, 'The Shop Window,' Rogers underscores Baum's principle that while misleading people is wrong, it's an almost necessary evil, as people demand \\"gratification of impossible wishes.\\" Thus the Wizard's Emerald City is largely an illusion, as are his hopeful solutions to the Scarecrow's, Lion's, and Tin Woodman's problems; \\"how can I help being a humbug...when all these people make me do things that everybody knows can't be done?\\"<br /><br />Rogers places the book in its proper historical fairytale context, and, in an accurate, happily non-politically correct psychoanalytical passage, claims that Dorothy is allowed \\"the opportunity, enviable to any child, of killing the bad mother without guilt.\\" Rogers also interprets 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz' within the context of its Americanism and the age in which it was written, and provides the etiology of the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman.<br /><br />Later chapters contain extended, equally interesting interpretations of the Gump, Jack Pumpkinhead, the sex-changing Tip, Ozma, the Woogle Bug, both Nome Kings, Tik-Tok, Scraps the Patchwork Girl, even Billina, the cantankerous hen.

The ambitions and expectations expressed by the speakers, narrators, and characters in the poems are humble, the horizons of their world near. One of the secrets of Riley's backward-glancing poems is that his reflections are only partially regretful; the joys of the past are equaled by the child-like joy still present in the adult poet's heart.  Dozens of the pieces included here are suitable for reading to and sharing with children.<br /><br />Titles 'The Swimming Hole,' 'The Noble Old Elm,' 'Company Manners,' 'When Mother Combed My Hair,' 'Us Farmers In The Country' 'My First Spectacles,' 'Blooms In May,' 'Two Sonnets To The June -Bug,' 'The Land Of Used-To-Be,' and 'Our Boyhood Haunts' offer a good indication of the book's content.<br /><br />There are numerous nature poems and celebrations of the seasons, summer meadows of \\"clover to the knee,\\" August moons, lazy rivers, \\"the twitter of the bluebird and the wren,\\" and, in one of Riley's most famous, the frost \\"on the punkin.\\"<br /><br />There are tributes to William McKinley and Abraham Lincoln, to Tennyson, Robert Burns, Robert Louis Stevenson, and Joel Chandler Harris. Famous characters 'Little Orphant Annie' and 'The Raggedy Man' are here; Puck makes an appearance \\"under a low crescent moon\\" in a poem of his own, as do Pan, Santa Claus, pixies, and goblins in others. Odes to boyhood best friends abound. People lived on closer terms with death in Riley's time, and, appropriately, a number of the poems address the subject, all of which express either blissful faith in the afterlife or sadness for the living left behind.<br /><br />Riley was endlessly inventive within the limited sphere of his talent, or, perhaps, within the limitations he purposefully set upon it. Oddly, there are relatively few poems celebrating romantic love and marriage.<br /><br />Riley, who never married, apparently held the adult world and women in particular in no little suspicion. In his poetry, eligible women are generally kept at what Riley must have felt was a safe distance, though there are numerous tributes to mothers, aunts, sisters, and little girls---even stepmothers are embraced lovingly. But when Riley wrote about single women and imagined wives, his poetic vision generally darkened.<br /><br />In 'The Werewife,' the volume's 'La Belle Dame Sans Merci,' Riley portrays the speaker's \\"fluttering, moth-winged soul\\" helplessly caught and mesmerized by his wife, a white-skinned, red-cheeked seductress who is also a murderous vampire.<br /><br />In 'The Mad Lover,' the narrator lives in a state of grim emotional paralysis after falling in love with 'Miriam Wayne,' though whether \\"fate\\" or Miriam herself is the cause of the \\"evil\\" and the lover's madness is not made clear.<br /><br />In 'Oh, Her Beauty,' the poet sings the praises his beloved's transcendent loveliness, but the last lines find him on his knees in thanks to God for revealing her spiritual ugliness at the eleventh hour.<br /><br />The plucky woman in 'Her Choice' is asked by her lover to chose his \\"love or hate,\\" and she chooses \\"your hate, my dear!\\"  The cuckolded man in 'The Lovely Husband' fans his wife and cold creams her face upon command, ignores her plucky unfaithfulness, and is every way a \\"handy hubby\\" and \\"lovey-dovey\\" until he cheerfully takes a shot gun and shoots her.<br /><br />The lover of the imprisoned killer in 'Life Sentence' is \\"false, while he was true,\\" \\"the mistress of all siren arts,\\" and \\"the poor soulless heroine of a hundred hearts!\\"<br /><br />Riley and Carl Sandburg were kindred souls; admirers of Sandburg will find that Sandburg's work was partially a progression of Riley's. Both poets' verse is filled with anecdotes, homey bits of wisdom, funny stories, songs, folk truisms, and legendary characters. Riley's poems are snippets of life, fireside tales, and reflections; unlike Sandburg, politics are occasionally touched upon but never the pivotal focus in Riley's work.<br /><br />How readers react to John Whitcomb Riley will depend on how they respond to the overtly sentimental and the character of the times in which he wrote, for these poems effortlessly evoke it.<br /><br />Though warmly sentimental, Riley was also bright and witty and full of spark, a dreamy, reflective, pre -urban poet of the small town and the home, of the sun porch and the rocking chair, of back fence gossip and street corner news, and of the American dream as it was conceived in his era.<br /><br />Potential readers may think themselves too sophisticated, cynical, or highbrow to enjoy the happily middlebrow works of James Whitcomb Riley. But such readers may be pleasantly surprised at how completely they find themselves immersed in Riley's detailed, frequently timeless, invigorating, and ingenious work.<br /><br />Despite its overall simplicity, Riley's work comfortably rests within the grander tradition of American literature, and makes for visionary reading in its own unique, whimsical manner.e,\\" \\"the mistress of all siren arts,\\" and \\"the poor soulless heroine of a hundred hearts!\\"<br /><br />Riley and Carl Sandburg were kindred souls; admirers of Sandburg will find that Sandburg's work was partially a progression of Riley's.

Those interested in fashion and costuming will find the extensive pages on clothing remarkable. The average description for most items tallies at about 100 words, most of which are superfluous but fun to read.<br /><br />There are 55 very detailed pages on clothing, hats, and accessories for men and boys, including $6.95 'Cashmere Suits,' $9.90 'Blue Flannel Grand Army Of The Republic Suits,' and 'Brownie Suits,' 'Fancy Sailor Suits,' and 'Children's Kilt Suits.'  These sections are bolstered by idealized figures of mustached men strolling by the seaside in striped suits and straw boaters, pipe-smoking deep thinkers poised in velvet smoking jackets, and bashful lads posing in knee britches.<br /><br />An equal number of pages are devoted to clothing, shoes, hats, and other accessories for women and girls, including 'Dr. Warner's Abdominal Corset' made with \\"extension steels, side lacings, and elastic gores on each side,\\" girl's \\"reefer jackets,\\" the $2.95 'Rich's Patent \\"Julie Marlowe\\" Lace Boot,' and 2 pages of heavily - festooned women's hats with names like 'the Leader,' 'the Susanne,' 'the Evangeline,' and 'the Bon Ton.'

US	35944741	RSPE4TNIV3HDU	0141182342	744273601	The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories (Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics)	Books	2	15	45	N	N	The Thing In Rockwell's Attic	What do Howard Phillips Lovecraft and Norman Rockwell have in common in 2002?<br /><br />Both artists are being newly appraised and embraced by the same establishments that officially shunned them for decades, which is interesting, as Lovecraft was the anti-Rockwell, a writer who saw deep shadows, howling monsters, and degenerate humanity in the same New England landscapes where the painter saw loving, if often struggling, families and neighbors living in relative homey comfort.<br /><br />There was a period in the 1970s when Lovecraft's books were kept in the 'classics' section of chain bookstores across America, an apparent mistake which was roundly corrected in the 1980s, when his fiction was regulated to the fantasy, horror, and science fiction area, presumably for good.<br /><br />The rapid changes in American life and culture today have scholars and critics taking a second look back at both Lovecraft and Rockwell, and finding something precious where they formerly found only the trite, the obvious, and the artistically dismissible.<br /><br />With 'The Call of Cthulhu and Other Weird Stories,' Lovecraft has been officially canonized with this, and a second, Penguin edition.  Lovecraft at last has earned his pedestal.<br /><br />This compilation is a mish-mash of Lovecraft that includes some of his best work, like 'The Colour Out Of Space' and 'The Outsider' as well as an unhealthy portion of his weakest material, such as 'He' and a famous story Lovecraft himself thought too poor to publish, 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth.'<br /><br />Editor Joshi's introduction and biography are comprehensive and informative, as are the wealth of footnotes that accompany each story. Lovers of the work of Washington Irving, Edgar Allen Poe, Montague Rhodes James, Algernon Blackwood, Arthur Machen or Shirley Jackson who might be oddly unfamiliar with Lovecraft's work, however, can start here.<br /><br />A lesser writer than all of those listed, Lovecraft, who started his career as a writer in the pulp magazines of the 1920s, has actually benefited posthumously from his status as an ultimately third-rate talent, since his tales and ideas are unchallenging, and thus accessible to even light material-tending readers, many of whom, historically, have taken up and carried on the Cthulhu cudgel.<br /><br />Lovecraft excelled at creating mood, and in developing his themes to the point of constriction, but, unfortunately, was a poor dramatist.<br /><br />Most of his stories, like 'The Whisperer In Darkness,' are simply too blatant: 'Whisperer'  compromises its mystery from its second page when the author drops a giant, dead crustacean in a New England river after an autumn flood.  A better writer could still make something worthwhile from this unsubtle maneuver; Lovecraft cannot.<br /><br />In many cases, such as in 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth,' the writing is simply too weak to allow the reader to suspend disbelief.  'He' opens brilliantly with several acute, timeless observations about life in New York City, but quickly slides into 10 confused and badly executed pages comprised of Indian curses, time travel, immortality, mysterious mansions, and slithering eye-covered masses of protoplasm.<br /><br />Lovecraft's \\"bloated fungoid moons,\\" \\"mighty beetle civilizations,\\" and \\"reptile people of fabled Valusia\\" are hackneyed, coarse, silly, and impossible to take seriously, if still fun for right audience.<br /><br />A typical Lovecraft piece begins with a narrator hesitantly reporting 'a story too horrible to tell,' ends with the same party found unconscious and semi-amnesiac by well-meaning strangers far from the climatic scene of trauma, and features the appearance, usually towards the middle, of at least one group of degenerate 'natives' babbling in an alien tongue and leaping naked around a fire.<br /><br />Lovecraft wrote parodies of his own work, but he just as often parodied himself and the genre, even when this was clearly not his intention.<br /><br />The sexless, reclusive, and xenophobic Lovecraft came, not surprisingly, from the dying line of an old New England family.

Patricia Cornwell's investigation into whether British painter Walker Sickert was in fact also infamous murderer Jack the Ripper has been fascinating to follow in the media over the last year. As the essence of any good investigation is clear, accurate perception, precision, and a rigorous search for the facts and truth by objective methods, it is by these standards that Cornwell's book must be considered.<br /><br />The author has accumulated an enormous amount of circumstantial evidence against Sickert, but 'Portrait of a Killer' is amateurishly written, sloppily executed, and poorly edited.<br /><br />For a famous crime writer, Cornwell has produced a weak book unlikely to stand up to scrutiny or survive the brunt of attacks by Ripperologists the world over, written as it has been for the uncritical  light reader.<br /><br />Every facet of 'Portrait of a Killer' seems rushed, as though Cornwell wrote with little consideration for structure and then submitted the manuscript without rereading, rewriting, or thinking it through as a whole. The awkward title alone suggests Cornwell's hesitations: 'Portrait of a Killer / Jack The Ripper / Case Closed.' Why not 'Walter Sickert: Portrait of a Killer,' or 'Walter Sickert: Jack The Ripper?' Why the reservation about damning her subject in the title, as she does so heartily in the text?<br /><br />For Cornwell damns Sickert before she's made her case, and from the first page.<br /><br />She immediately refers to Sickert as a killer as if this were an objective fact, and as a 'psychopath,' a phrase she bandies about loosely and without proper definition throughout the book.<br /><br />By contemptuously referring to his rented East End studios as 'ratholes' upon their first mention, Cornwell makes her biases entirely clear. As a result, Sickert's habit of long walks become 'obsessive walks,' and his love of walking at night becomes evidence of his psychopathology, when night walking was also the habit of Edgar Allen Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Paul Bowles, Walt Whitman, Thoreau, and Charles Baudelaire.<br /><br />Sickert's penchant for watching and studying people is also interpreted as a sign of his predatory madness, rather than as an attribute common to most visual artists, actors, and writers--to say nothing of detectives and crime writers.<br /><br />Describing a poem sent to the police and signed 'Jack the Ripper' which she believes was written by Sickert, Cornwell describes the poem's rhymes as \\"not those of an illiterate or deranged person.\\" Since she believes Sickert was a \\"psychopath,\\" by what criteria was he a \\"psychopath\\" but not a \\"deranged person?\\" Cornwell says of the broken, middle-aged Sickert, \\"He subsisted in filth and chaos. He was a slob and he stank,\\" but on the next page states, \\"he traversed the surface of life as a respectable, intellectual gentleman.\\"<br /><br />The same easy logic the author uses to turn the lights on Sickert could be used on anyone, at anytime. Cornwell has been obsessed with and made a career of criminal behavior, death, and murder herself; by her own what-makes-madness equation, shouldn't she explain her own morbid preoccupations to the reader?<br /><br />In light of the many sound accomplishments found here, it's unfortunate how many errors in judgement Cornwell has made, especially if \\"staking her career\\" on this volume as she says she is.<br /><br />Sickert is portrayed on any number of pages as manipulative, bizarre, cunning, misogynistic, treacherous, desperate for attention, and dangerously arrogant--Cornwell states these are facts about his character--but provides almost no sources for her information, when this should have been scrupulously documented.<br /><br />The worst others have to say about Sickert comes to almost nothing. Under oath, former teacher Whistler says, \\"Walter has a treacherous side to his character,\\" his first wife's sister, who clearly disliked Sickert, perhaps with good reason, says \\"they cannot know what he really is as you do,\\" and Clive Bell refers to him a man of \\"no standards.\\" In exaggerated fashion, Cornwell calls Sickert a \\"master of disguise\\"--a master, not just an aficionado--but again provides no sources.<br /><br />Viewing early drawings by Sickert--or, she admits, perhaps drawn by his father--Cornwell believes she already sees clear evidence of a woman-hater and a violent, disturbed mind.<br /><br />But when the reader refers to these drawings, the figures are hardly more than stick figures; one male figure Cornwell ominously perceives as \\"about to spring\\" at a defenseless woman looks more like a hemorrhoid sufferer hesitantly lowering himself onto a cold toilet.<br /><br />Yet two Ripper letters containing drawings obviously done by a talented hand are called \\"crude.\\" An in-profile caricature of a woman is said to have \\"an ugly mole\\" on the nose, but the \\"mole\\" is clearly just an oversized, if still unsightly, nostril.<br /><br />Readers will get the sense that one thing Cornwell isn't is a visual artist, a race she seems to have little understanding of or sympathy with.<br /><br />Sickert's relationships with his wives is barely touched upon until the end, and what first wife Ellen thought about her husband, whom she loved until her death, is never made clear.<br /><br />Since Cornwell believes Sickert was impotent all his life and perhaps left without a penis after three traumatic childhood surgeries, the reader should know a great deal about his marital life, and what his wives felt about marrying a man only to discover a eunuch in their honeymoon beds.<br /><br />Cornwell, in sadly politically correct fashion, quotes her mentor Dr. Marcella Fierro as saying \\"a woman has the right to walk around naked and not be raped or murdered.\\" In the theoretical and idealized Garden of Eden of liberalism, that certainly may be the case. Reality, again, is something else. Cornwell embarrasses herself by stooping so low to make an unnecessary case for the Ripper's desperate, tragic victims.<br /><br />The author should have spent several more years on this book and then written a scholarly, definitive account of her presently unfinished investigation. Why the rush to publication?<br /><br />Cornwell's errors and misjudgements throughout will only raise powerful doubts about her methods and conclusions, and prejudice the reader against the more solid fruits of her labor.s as you do,\\" and Clive Bell refers to him a man of \\"no standards.\\" In exaggerated fashion, Cornwell calls Sickert a \\"master of disguise\\"--a master, not just an aficionado--but again provides no sources.<br /><br />Viewing early drawings by Sickert--or, she admits, perhaps drawn by his father--Cornwell believes she already sees clear evidence of a woman-hater and a violent, disturbed mind.<br /><br />But when the reader refers to these drawings, the figures are hardly more than stick figures; one male figure Cornwell ominously perceives as \\"about to spring\\" at a defenseless woman looks more like a hemorrhoid sufferer hesitantly lowering himself onto a cold toilet.<br /><br />Yet two Ripper letters containing drawings obviously done by a talented hand are called \\"crude.\\" An in-profile caricature of a woman is said to have \\"an ugly mole\\" on the nose, but the \\"mole\\" is clearly just an oversized, if still unsightly, nostril.<br /><br />Readers will get the sense that one thing Cornwell isn't is a visual artist, a race she seems to have little understanding of or sympathy with.<br /><br />Sickert's relationships with his wives is barely touched upon until the end, and what first wife Ellen thought about her husband, whom she loved until her death, is never made clear.<br /><br />Since Cornwell believes Sickert was impotent all his life and perhaps left without a penis after three traumatic childhood surgeries, the reader should know a great deal about his marital life, and what his wives felt about marrying a man only to discover a eunuch in their honeymoon beds.<br /><br />Cornwell, in sadly politically correct fashion, quotes her mentor Dr. Marcella Fierro as saying \\"a woman has the right to walk around naked and not be raped or murdered.\\" In the theoretical and idealized Garden of Eden of liberalism, that certainly may be the case.

US	35944741	R2AHO28TPWK1NE	0802130887	528335592	Miracle of the Rose	Books	5	22	24	N	N	A Sinking Ship Has Cast The Light Upon The Land	Genet's second novel, 'The Miracle of the Rose' (1946) is a phantasmagorical account of his youthful incarceration in the Mettray penal colony and subsequent imprisonment in the adult facility of Fountevrault.  The author portrays Mettray as a womb-like hive of sunless corridors and constricting passages that both shelters the prisoners and guards and incubates their stark attempts at individual development.<br /><br />The formless men of Mettray constantly meld and mesh into one another, existing between mental and emotional states of absolute being and permanent dissolution and drift. Genet sees the hieratical Mettray as \\"the universe itself,\\" something he finds \\"fabulous.\\" Surrounded by 400 other confined men, many who are attractive and apparently virile, young Genet searches for potential lovers and models upon which he might base his coreless identity.<br /><br />The narrator identifies these young men as his literal brothers, born from the same maternal body of childhood desolation leading to crime, and is highly drawn to this incestuous angle of his attractions.<br /><br />He describes the other boys \\"stroking themselves\\" in unison alone in their single unit cells, the mixed perfume of wisteria and rose vines creating a \\"vegetable incest\\" which wafts over their dreaming heads; he \\"yearns for a mother,\\" feels he's returned, via Mettray, to \\"the mother's throbbing breast,\\" and describes the prison and his mood as permanently tinted in autumnal shades.<br /><br />The female principle reasonably dominates the state of male immaturity, and in both benevolent and malevolent fashion, for Mettray is surrounded by a minefield of \\"traps laid by women's hands\\" that create an \\"invisible, undetectable danger\\" which throws would be escapees into \\"wild panic.\\" For hoping to gain the fifty franc reward that comes with each capture, local women lie in silent, unseen wait like archetypal witches, accompanied by shotguns, pitchforks, and dogs.<br /><br />Unloved, cast out, and uneducated, the instinctively virility-seeking boys of Mettray are little more than unindividuated eggs united in a desperate search for a master sperm bearer to fertilize and transform them into legitimate men. Each acts as a 'double' for another, but combined, the two halves still add up to less than one definite being.<br /><br />Though some \\"big guys\\" and \\"toughs,\\" especially mysterious Christ figure Harcomone, act as witting or unwitting father substitutes to those in need, 'Mother' conquers in the end. Returning years later to find Mettray in ruins, Genet sadly notes that swallows have built their nests in its window ledges, grass sprouts between the impregnable stones, and thorn bearing vegetation covers and \\"pierces\\" the place. The rugged house of troubled, fragile lads has returned to the soil forever.<br /><br />Fifteen years later, at Fountevrault, Genet finds hero and double murderer Harcomone locked in irons in solitary confinement, condemned to death.<br /><br />He discovers Fountevrault's foundational hub when he stumbles upon former Mettray lover Divers, a powerful and handsome tough, freakishly squatting atop the central iron cone which serves as a toilet, his genitals exposed and hanging as he defecates loudly, surrounded as he is by the circle of punished and endlessly marching prisoners he oversees and verbally abuses daily.<br /><br />Thus the lord of Fountevrault is an unconscious, ridiculous clown and fool, his pointed punishment and dunce cap under him instead of atop his head. Nonchalant Divers, \\"a barbaric king on a metal throne\\" gets up \\"without wiping\\" and actively resumes command as Genet allows himself the pleasure of sniffing Divers' \\"vast and serene\\" bowel gases. Drunk with sensation, Genet commits a willful infraction and happily joins Divers' marching circle, which becomes his new microcosm of \\"eternal reoccurrence.\\"<br /><br />While the broad-shouldered \\"big guys\\" gather in all alpha male groups like a huddle of mountain gorillas,Genet loves--and often confuses--three men. Divers; dying, crown-of-thorns bearing god and great subject of prison gossip Harcomone; and mercurial \\"chicken\\" Pierrot, who straddles the safer middle ground and whose essence contains elements of both men.<br /><br />Genet sees Pierrot as a Sphinx and himself as a \\"questioning Oedipus,\\" he describes their desperate lovemaking, clandestine stairwell meetings, and risking note passing, but later says they were never lovers and met only on twelve occasions. Divers and Harcomone are the twin father kings of Fountevrault: earthy, feces-smeared Divers, who upholds macho postures even while defecating, symbolizes the Genet's reality principle.<br /><br />Supernatural Harcomone, the single complete man, \\"the emanation of a power stronger than himself,\\" is even loved and cherished  by the stars, moon, and seas -- by nature, his transcendent bride. Paternal Harcomone had once read nightly to the youths at Mettray from a book intended for very small children; now his chains blossom fragrantly into white roses before the astonished prisoners, an experience divinely denied the guards. Harcomone's rapidly approaching execution by beheading becomes a crisis for everyone under Fountevrault's roof.<br /><br />Active mystic Genet calls himself \\"the spirit that hovers over the shapeless mass of dreams,\\" \\"a dead man who sees his skeleton in the mirror,\\" one who \\"sings the void\\"  and who strains \\"every fiber to see very high or very far within himself.\\" By \\"cutting all threads\\" that hold him to the world, he \\"plunges\\" into \\"prison, foulness, dreaming, and hell,\\" believing this will land him in a garden \\"of saintliness where roses bloom.\\"<br /><br />Exhausting himself with the effort, he manages, by a kind of remote viewing, to project himself into the condemned man's cell during the last nights of Harcomone's life, where he finds Harcomone already a ghost, his spirit drifting through the prison, and visited by specters.<br /><br />Perhaps Genet's most deeply felt novel, the meditative 'Miracle of the Rose' finds the author alternately confronting and avoiding his deepest obsessions and the shadowy motivators stirring uncomfortably within him.<br /><br />The archetypal \\"ghosts\\" of the male and female parental figures, in both their nurturing and paralyzing aspects, constantly overwhelm Genet's consciousness, are projected, embodied (Genet, the bride, is officially wedded to Divers in an elaborately structured midnight ceremony) or obscurely grappled with during moments of reverie. Transvestite figures and shifting configurations of gender and persona abound; male identity, like the ever shifting and unsustainable ocean shoreline, is in constant, painful flux, perpetually threatened with an obscuring inundation that will reduce man back to his earliest, in utero female state of existence.Genet loves--and often confuses--three men.

Despite the violent  emotions the characters feel for one another, when they actually speak, their words are banal, monosyllabic, and thus lacking in complex information; the only extensive dialogues are internal. Genet's philosophy is clearly stated: \\"Speech kills, poisons, mutilates, distorts, dirties.\\"<br /><br />As the book opens, Genet's love object--a young resistance fighter also named Jean--has just been killed and buried. There are extended early passages about the dejection Genet feels; he states that \\"the book is completely devoted to the cult of a dead person with whom I am living on intimate terms.\\" However, Genet questions whether the 'Jean' to whom the book is dedicated is the dead man or himself, and soon refers to him as \\"my poor Jean-in-the-box\\" and thinks of him as \\"changing into fertilizer.\\" Eventually Jean becomes something of an afterthought, as Genet turns away from the dead towards his lust for the living.<br /><br />The conversational, episodic plot concerns Genet's interactions with the remaining members of Jean's family, as well as with German Erik, former Hitler Youth member and current tank-driver for Hitler, and  youthful French traitor Riton, a collaborator with the Reich.<br /><br />Genet presents an awesomely entwined branch of relationships: Genet and the dead Jean; Genet's casual friendship with Jean's brother Paulo, who is both Hitler's and Genet's lover in Genet's fantasies; Giselle, Jean's steadfastly bourgeois mother, is Erik's mistress and keeper regardless of his Nazism; Erik and Riton are physical and emotional lovers; Erik, who clearly gets around, is also the submissive lover of Hitler's massive, unnamed, ax-wielding executioner; unattractive Juliette, Giselle's despised housemaid, is Jean's  former fianc&eacute;, and Genet and Erik also become sexual partners in time, and right under Giselle's roof.<br /><br />Genet adds another layer of complexity by having character 'Genet' transform mid-scene into the characters he is describing.<br /><br />Genet briefly becomes Joan of Arc just before she is burned alive, and replaces Erik as the killer when Erik decides to murder an innocent country boy to establish his manhood. Genet also steps into other shoes during the erotic passages, metamorphosing into Hitler (who sends \\"his finest-looking men to death\\" because he can't bugger them all, Genet says) when the Fuhrer orders Paulo aside and rapes him, an act Paulo accepts flatteringly  and actively responds to. The narrative also moves frequently backward and forward in time, and at least one murdered character (not Jean) shows up robustly alive after his death.<br /><br />Unlike the later novels, few defensive statements are made about the sexual interaction between  the men, who alternately accept male and female lovers without question, as if this were the natural state of things worldwide (though other men seem to be the sexual partner of choice).<br /><br />The tough men of 'Funeral Rites' do not constantly  challenge and tease one another about standing, dominance, and submission; instead, they seem to take sexuality in all its manifestations pleasantly in their stride. Erik openly makes love to Riton in front of his soldier comrades, none of which bat an eye; when two grave diggers conspire to rape a maid (Juliette?), they fondle and caress her but also reach for one another's hands under her skirt.<br /><br />'Funeral Rites' is humorously obsessed with scatology and flatulence, using both as none-too-subtle weapons against the despised French middle class.<br /><br />In one hilariously protracted episode, Giselle, tired of waiting on chisel-faced Erik, retires to her room to \\"release her wind,\\" only to find she's let fly with something more than she intended and that impatient lover Erik is entering her small, temporarily unventilated room.<br /><br />In another, a prison chaplain, hurrying to give last rites to 28 falsely-accused boys, finding himself in the outhouse without toilet paper, imprudently decides to use his hand, and is then suddenly confronted by God.<br /><br />Hardly a character in the book escapes breaking wind, wiping themselves, or anxiously wondering about the state of their anal hygiene.<br /><br />Genet tells of finding dried feces lovingly sequestered in the doilied, oaken drawers of the bourgeoisie, and, taking up a favorite motif, has 'Genet' hoping that he still genitally harbors some of dead Jean's crab lice.<br /><br />After having failed to crawl into Erik's sheltering and flower-bearing anal cavity, Genet uses his tongue to pinpoint the lice on Erik's back end which are bloated with his virile blood.<br /><br />In addition, there are scenes of wanton cruelty that may disgust some readers, such as that in which starving Riton kills a cat with a hammer, but most of the material seems sensational and mischievous rather than offensive. More restrained and less indulgent that 'The Thief's Journal' (1949), if also less deeply felt, 'Funeral Rites' is an excellent choice for new readers approaching Genet's work. Genet seems oddly more confident and hopeful about himself and mankind here, perhaps as a result of the emotional catharsis (as well as the victory) provided by the war.eapons against the despised French middle class.<br /><br />In one hilariously protracted episode, Giselle, tired of waiting on chisel-faced Erik, retires to her room to \\"release her wind,\\" only to find she's let fly with something more than she intended and that impatient lover Erik is entering her small, temporarily unventilated room.<br /><br />In another, a prison chaplain, hurrying to give last rites to 28 falsely-accused boys, finding himself in the outhouse without toilet paper, imprudently decides to use his hand, and is then suddenly confronted by God.<br /><br />Hardly a character in the book escapes breaking wind, wiping themselves, or anxiously wondering about the state of their anal hygiene.<br /><br />Genet tells of finding dried feces lovingly sequestered in the doilied, oaken drawers of the bourgeoisie, and, taking up a favorite motif, has 'Genet' hoping that he still genitally harbors some of dead Jean's crab lice.<br /><br />After having failed to crawl into Erik's sheltering and flower-bearing anal cavity, Genet uses his tongue to pinpoint the lice on Erik's back end which are bloated with his virile blood.<br /><br />In addition, there are scenes of wanton cruelty that may disgust some readers, such as that in which starving Riton kills a cat with a hammer, but most of the material seems sensational and mischievous rather than offensive.

Schneider's dynamic 'Halloween In America: A Collector's Guide With Prices' (1995) spectacularly captures the spirit of the classic years of the American Halloween tradition: the period from the turn of the century through the end of the nineteen-fifties. Though the book includes more recent material, Schneider wisely focuses on what he recognizes to be the holiday's glory days in this country, when its spirit hadn't moved too far from its agricultural roots and American culture was predominantly positive, forward-looking, and uncynical--and its Halloween decorations charming and vividly imaginative.<br /><br />The book opens with three short, loosely-composed essays, \\"A Brief History Of Halloween,\\" \\"The Colors And Images Of Halloween,\\" and \\"Halloween In America.\\" Schneider, who provides no source material, is often broadly correct but specifically wrong.<br /><br />He suggests, for instance, that the Druids may have built Stonehenge when it has been long established that they did not, and that 'Dryad' is another word for 'Druid.'<br /><br />The author also writes a paragraph about witches and \\"witch conventions\\" during the Celtic reign of the British Isles as if this were an established historical fact, embellishing his account with images of witches stirring cauldrons, speaking in tongues, dancing around bon fires, and sacrificing animals; if Schneider knows this to be historically factual, then he has access to information the rest of the world doesn't.<br /><br />He also discusses 'Samhain' as a god of the Celtic people who \\"controlled the dead or non-growing season,\\" when whether or not 'Samhain' was a Celtic deity or even an entity, rather than a season or holiday, is something currently hotly debated among historians, scholars, and Wiccans.<br /><br />Schneider is to be commended for his honesty in addressing some of the more unpleasant aspects of the holiday and its associations head-on, as well as for the wonderful historical scope he provides in placing Halloween origins in a wide, multi-cultural context.<br /><br />Readers will find a rich phantasmagoria of topics discussed in the essays, including the custom of sin eating, All Saints' and All Souls' Days, the belief in the 'veil between worlds' and the return of the dead to their families one the night of the harvest feast, the story of 'Jack of the Lantern,' Snap-Apple and Crack-Nut Nights, apple bobbing, fortune-telling, the Scottish influence on American Halloween traditions, Cabbage and Mischief Nights, the various theories surrounding the origin of trick-or-treating, the meaning of the literal 'scapegoat' and its influence of the appearance of the Christian Devil, the Mexican Day of the Dead, and even mention of the elves, gnomes, boogies, and goblins with which agrarian societies peopled the forests and fields.<br /><br />The gorgeous main portion of the book is dedicated to collectible items and includes sections on Postcards, Decorations, Lanterns, Costumes, Hats and Masks, Noisemakers, Invitations, Games and Toys, Trick Or Treat Bags, and Vegetable People, Figurines and Candy Containers.<br /><br />Halloween In America is by far the best of the books on Halloween collectibles available, and also the best of the Schiffer books on the subject.<br /><br />Many readers will remember these items from their childhood homes, classroom bulletin boards, Five & Dime store shelves and windows, and neighborhood parties. Readers will also be astonished at how the painters, artisans, and creators of these crepe paper, cardboard, composition, glass, and celluloid items were able to envision and capture what we remember and still think of as the very essence of holiday, and in a wide variety of forms: lonely, barren, orange-skied landscapes with setting suns ablaze or yellow rising moons, black cats and owls lurking in pumpkin patches with an anthropomorphic moon overhead, witches flying on broomsticks in formation over dark, isolated houses, skeletons paradingin graveyards, etc.<br /><br />Folklorists, sociologists, academics, and artists may have special appreciation for the visionary and sometimes surreal paintings, illustrations, and three-dimensional designs revealed here.<br /><br />One 1908 German postcard portrays a witch, a black cat and a vegetable spirit riding in a car made of a partially hollowed-out watermelon with squash-slice tires; another portrays a red-caped witch riding a immense cob of husked corn like a phallus-conquering  Amazon through the stratosphere, with an astonished moon and planet Jupiter looking on; and a third, from 1911, shows children happily bobbing for apples in their warm, cozy home, while a tall, red-skirted, stone-faced witch, accompanied by an owl and a black cat, looks in at the window like the ultimate outsider and a disenfranchised, but still proud and powerful, loner.<br /><br />An entire page is devoted to 1910 postcards of anthropomorphic vegetables riding cars, dancing with or chasing fairies, and joyfully imitating human family practices.<br /><br />Others display Rockwell-like scenes of boys and girls carving pumpkins or trick-or-treating, or elderly women in dimly-lit Victorian mansions being frightened by children's pranks and high jinks.<br /><br />Throughout the book, visionary landscapes and distant horizons beckon; curly-toed elves spring from hollow trees and slide gleefully down rooftops; lone witches warm their hands at their cauldrons under brilliant, star-filled skies; beautiful young ladies sleep fitfully on ruffled pillows while fairies circle their heads; peaked-hat shadows stretch in threateningly at midnight doorways; black cats screech to their own banjo, accordion, violin, and horn playing; and scarecrows extend their arms heavenwards to frighten off their circling opponents.<br /><br />Readers will run for their magnifying and/or reading glasses so that none of the often minute detail will escape their gaze and inspection. 'Halloween In America' is a huge treat, will make collectors and seekers out of most, and hopefully inspire generations to come to celebrate and pass on the traditions recorded here. Highly recommended to holiday lovers, educators, folklorists, Scout leaders, and all lovers of Americana.in graveyards, etc.<br /><br />Folklorists, sociologists, academics, and artists may have special appreciation for the visionary and sometimes surreal paintings, illustrations, and three-dimensional designs revealed here.<br /><br />One 1908 German postcard portrays a witch, a black cat and a vegetable spirit riding in a car made of a partially hollowed-out watermelon with squash-slice tires; another portrays a red-caped witch riding a immense cob of husked corn like a phallus-conquering  Amazon through the stratosphere, with an astonished moon and planet Jupiter looking on; and a third, from 1911, shows children happily bobbing for apples in their warm, cozy home, while a tall, red-skirted, stone-faced witch, accompanied by an owl and a black cat, looks in at the window like the ultimate outsider and a disenfranchised, but still proud and powerful, loner.<br /><br />An entire page is devoted to 1910 postcards of anthropomorphic vegetables riding cars, dancing with or chasing fairies, and joyfully imitating human family practices.<br /><br />Others display Rockwell-like scenes of boys and girls carving pumpkins or trick-or-treating, or elderly women in dimly-lit Victorian mansions being frightened by children's pranks and high jinks.<br /><br />Throughout the book, visionary landscapes and distant horizons beckon; curly-toed elves spring from hollow trees and slide gleefully down rooftops; lone witches warm their hands at their cauldrons under brilliant, star-filled skies; beautiful young ladies sleep fitfully on ruffled pillows while fairies circle their heads; peaked-hat shadows stretch in threateningly at midnight doorways; black cats screech to their own banjo, accordion, violin, and horn playing; and scarecrows extend their arms heavenwards to frighten off their circling opponents.<br /><br />Readers will run for their magnifying and/or reading glasses so that none of the often minute detail will escape their gaze and inspection.

US	35944741	R1EL97D9VP1GLA	0802130143	774138112	The Thief's Journal	Books	5	58	63	N	N	In The Age Of The Poet-Assassins	In Jean Genet's complex novel 'The Thief's Journal' (1949), the author has modeled his protagonist, Jean, on himself, and the loose, conversational plot after his own experiences as a young thief, drifter, and poet in thirties and forties Europe.<br /><br />'Jean' is Genet's fictional recreation of himself; but readers should keep in mind that Jean's relationship to Genet is to some degree imaginative. The book provides an excellent illustration of how even when speaking or writing with as complete an honesty as believed possible, man is still caught in a process of creation, structuring, and discrimination--a process of fictionalization. Therefore, honesty, sincerity, and truthfulness always retain elements of artifice, and, as pure states, remain ideals only.<br /><br />Abandoned by his family as a boy, sentenced to reform school at sixteen, as a young man, Jean is still \\"alone, rigorously so,\\" he lives \\"with desolation in satanic solitude.\\" Realizing early that he is, in status and nature, completely at odds with the social order, Jean learns through trial and error how to care and not to care, how to make all possible outcomes to his actions reasonably acceptable.<br /><br />\\"Rejecting the world that rejected me,\\" Jean exacerbates his position: identifying with his rejectee status, he feels it appropriate that he should \\"aggravate this condition with a preference for boys.\\" Thus his homosexuality is at least partially an act of self-creation, part of his perverse desire to transgress the rules of order as broadly as possible. Jean decides he will henceforth admit to guilt whenever accused, regardless of the truth or the nature of the crime, and thus rob his accusers of the ability to jeopardize his fate.<br /><br />\\"Betrayal, theft, and homosexuality are the basic subject of this book,\\" he says. For Jean, theft becomes a means of survival while simultaneously representing a daily blow against society. If caught and arrested, he readily throws himself into the homosexual life of the prison, making himself available to those in authority as well as to fellow inmates.<br /><br />Jean allows himself  a somewhat desperate game of searching for a dominant male partner who is completely, impossibly powerful. Submitting physically and emotionally  to men he believes meet this standard, Jean repeatedly proves himself the more powerful by betraying the men when he inevitably senses a definitive crack in his exaggerated conception of them.<br /><br />Once he has glimpsed  some \\"inelegant,\\" unforgivable portion of their imperfect humanity, his slavish masochism fades and sociopathic indifference replaces it: the abandonee becomes the abandoner and assassin. For Jean, a well-planned, keenly-felt personal betrayal is the ultimate show of toughness and  \\"a handsome gesture, compounded with nervous force and grace.\\"<br /><br />As in Genet's other novels, homosexual love and physical interaction is a given between all of the male characters--pimps, prostitutes, gamblers, gangsters, and thugs--each of whom has a theoretical set of rules and limits concerning the  degree of their own participation. But regardless of their speeches and proud macho denunciations, they loosen their belts for one another at a moment's notice if they feel so inclined.<br /><br />Genet cleverly has Jean reacting and reporting in the same indeterminate manner: Jean identifies Michaelis as wholly homosexual but then denies it; one-armed stud Stilitano, who wears a  bunch of artificial grapes buttoned inside his fly to lure strangers and enhance his mystique, routinely denies Jean access to his body at night but coyly raises the subject repeatedly during daylight hours. Regardless, Stilitano and Jean live and share a bed together, affectionately plucking one another clean of head and body lice.<br /><br />Ugly Salvador strikes Jean on the street for kissing him in public while simultaneously whispering, \\"tonight, if you like,\\" in his ear. When hairy Armand decides herespects Jean too much to be anything other than friends, Jean sleeps between his open legs, Armand's colossal sex organs resting nightly on his forehead.<br /><br />Only gorilla-like, Paul Muni-faced Java is wholly unconcerned with the nature of his acts or words. He provocatively exposes himself to other men in saloons, daring them to hold and guess the weight of his genitals, and repeatedly forces himself on willing Jean, who, gloriously  obliterated by Java's assault, finds it a blissful but inevitably temporary salvation. Java \\"cringes in fright\\" during a fight, and Jean sees even his cringing as beautiful. But then \\"yellow diarrhea flows down his monumental thighs,\\" and--well, so much for Java.<br /><br />Clinging to his masochistic illusion, Jean continues drifting, his submissive position a seeming necessity. When  discovered sleeping in a beachfront shack by a guard, Jean services him automatically and the guard accepts it automatically as a given in turn. These are the strange, all-encompassing rules of Genet's world.  But free or imprisoned, single or partnered, masochist or sly sadist, Jean is ultimately self-fulfilling and independent.<br /><br />Jean, who says \\"metamorphosis lies in wait for us,\\" is an almost unknown quintessence, a mass of animal meat and instincts coupled with emerging homo sapien characteristics.<br /><br />Constantly in a liminal state of becoming, he atavistically prefers stepping sideways or backward instead of forward; for long periods his existence seems mere ostensible movement through time and space. But Jean, who in fact secretly enjoys and protects his isolation, really seeks only to fulfill himself \\"in the rarest of destinies,\\" a kind of quest for \\"sainthood,\\" one born of reducing himself to pure essence and thus becoming his own temple, savior, and deity.<br /><br />On this final road, which Jean sees reachable by both subjective and objective methods, including sacred betrayal, there is in truth no room for anyone but himself, as there will be none afterward when he has attained his goal of becoming a selfless but self-complete being, like Jung's psychological, alchemical, and hieratical hermaphrodite.<br /><br />'The Thief's Journal' is a full-frontal, multi-layered book that should be read several times to be fully appreciated. One of the finest portrayals of the introverted character in literature, 'The Thief's Journal' has a great many things to express about man's nature and psychology, most of which should be revelatory if somewhat jarring to the general reader.respects Jean too much to be anything other than friends, Jean sleeps between his open legs, Armand's colossal sex organs resting nightly on his forehead.<br /><br />Only gorilla-like, Paul Muni-faced Java is wholly unconcerned with the nature of his acts or words.

Solitary, &#34;fluent in outrage,&#34; cranky, lovelorn, misanthropic, and pedagogical by turns, these pieces find the poet stalking bereaved widows, peering unseen through the candle-lit windows of neighbor's homes, asking philosophical questions of &#34;enigmatical&#34; strangers, shunning crowds, greeting the twilight with a bow, reading the time of day in a cat's eyes, &#34;beating the poor,&#34; and listening, eavesdropping, and relentlessly observing wherever he goes.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, the poet's vision of urban Paris lies somewhere between the canvases of Degas and Toulouse-Lautrec: garishly colored, grotesque, heavily populated with heaving women and friable grande dames, Baudelaire's city is a stage for life's pantomime, open to and allowing for all combinations and possibilities. By contrast, his autumnal countryside is a place of relative purity, where the poet wanders alone under stark blue skies and roaming, shadow-casting clouds.<br /><br />In one of the more hallucinatory episodes, the poet, &#34;under a vast gray sky, on a vast and dusty plain&#34; comes upon a procession of men with &#34;worn and serious faces,&#34; each of whom carries a very large, monstrous &#34;chimera&#34; on his back, the muscles, tendons and limbs of the beasts wrapped tightly around them. None the wiser after asking these men his litany of inevitable questions, the poet observes that &#34;under the depressing dome of the sky&#34; the men moved past and beyond him, each &#34;with the resigned look of men who are condemned to hope forever.&#34;<br /><br />'Paris Spleen' is a wise, serious and dour work. But if its only occasionally tragic  underpinnings and conclusions can be embraced by its audience, then its vibrant, bawdy and transcendent aspect reveals itself shamelessly in turn. Baudelaire is so confident, unselfconscious, and plain-spoken that his perceptions are remarkably easy to visualize, his emotions as expressed surprisingly easy to relate to. Few books are as multi-prismed as this.<br /><br />The poet implies that if man could accept mortality, reasonably subdue his ego, and curb his more flagrant dreams, life would begin to resemble the far from perfect, but certainly tolerable and potentially enjoyable, miracle that it actually is.<br /><br />Baudelaire seems to have reached the same conclusion that Isak Dinsen did at the end of her memoir, 'Out Of Africa' (1937): man must accept, without exclusion, every facet, aspect, element, and component of existence before existence--before life--will give anything back to him.<br /><br />Perfectly translated by Louise Varese, this edition allows the non-poet to see, however briefly, as a poet sees.nd dusty plain&#34; comes upon a procession of men with &#34;worn and serious faces,&#34; each of whom carries a very large, monstrous &#34;chimera&#34; on his back, the muscles, tendons and limbs of the beasts wrapped tightly around them.

US	35944741	R3S8JXN7RUQ02J	0691017522	913358230	The Psychology of the Transference	Books	5	77	79	N	N	The Apex, Not The Ape	The penultimate title of C.G. Jung's 20-volume Collected Works, 'The Psychology of the Transference' is a short, seemingly complex book which readily rewards the reader who perseveres and is unintimidated by Jung's lengthy sentences, the alchemical illustrations, or the numerous passages in Latin.<br /><br />Jung's subject is his discovery that the \\"great work\\" of the 16th and 17th century alchemists--a search for the 'philosopher's stone' of 'psychic wholeness' (as opposed to 'psychic perfection')--corresponds closely to the psychological process of the transference (a dynamic set of duo projections of unconscious psychic contents).<br /><br />The alchemical process mysteriously corresponds not only the transference possible between psychologist and patient, but between any two individuals who spontaneously (unconsciously) constellate some part of the other's psyche through normal human interaction.<br /><br />However, as with all of Jung's later work, the book's larger focus is the psychic evolution of the individual. The pivotal message of 'The Psychology of the Transference' is that the process of cautiously evolving one's consciousness to the hypothetical point of 'individuation' or 'integration,' is primarily a moral and ethical one.  The book stresses that it is also a critically necessary process, however painful and potentially dangerous.  In Jung's estimation, mankind has no choice but to accept the challenge of psychic evolution: the alternative is a perpetual present state of misunderstanding, hatred, suspicion, bigotry, oppression, war, and genocide.<br /><br />Like Freud, Jung believed that man's psyche contains an enormous multi-tier unconscious reservoir, one which not only dwarfs man's generally narrow consciousness but is also the matrix in which consciousness originated (thus the alchemical motto \\"high rests on low\\").<br /><br />The unconscious is the original abode of all drives, demons, and daimons, all instincts and angels, all creativity and appetites for destruction.  Since many of its contents are unacceptable to modern man--the most foundational of these being the incest complex--these damned and rejected contexts are not and cannot be readily integrated into consciousness.<br /><br />Instead, they are spontaneously projected outward onto other human beings, social classes, institutions, and countries--onto any 'object' that is perceived as other and different from the self.  No man can evolve his consciousness without first becoming aware of and retracting these projections and learning to comfortably accept them as his own dark potentialities.<br /><br />It is not simply of matter of leaving the instinctual man behind, but of learning to integrate the necessary if often unattractive instinctual and vital functions into consciousness before moving forward. Thus the process is one of refinement and accumulation and not one of elimination.<br /><br />Only the first major step in a series (Emerson: \\"Every ultimate fact is only the first of a new series\\"), the confrontation with and integration of the 'shadow' is often a harrowing and precarious process.  If man accepts this task without ample preparation, inner fortification, and secure sense of identity (which he nonetheless must be willing to forgo), he may come to despise himself, lose all motivation, become morally degenerate, or commit suicide.<br /><br />But if he does not recognize, accept and take up his own cross, he will blame, and attempt to injure or destroy, other people, classes, races, or countries to eradicate the sense of indefinable angst, doubt, suspicion, and fear that impinges itself so relentlessly upon his psyche; as Jung perfectly expressed it, he will endlessly attempt to free himself of \\"that thing that thrusts itself tyrannically upon him in the stillness and loneliness of the night.\\"<br /><br />Only after man has accepted and integrated his 'shadow' can he, 'reborn,' proceed rightfully ahead. It is this slow process ('make haste slowly' was another motto of the alchemists) of prudent illumination towards conscious realization of the \\"whole man,\\" or \\"self,\\" as Jung called it, that the alchemists referred to as \\"the great work,\\" the highest single achievement of which man is capable.<br /><br />Thus, though the alchemists apparently sought to turn base metal into gold, \\"gold\\" was in truth a simple metaphor for successfully integrated consciousness.  Clearly, most of mankind, finding the burden of unconsciousness easier to bear than the burden of conscious realization and responsibility, regrettably and understandably fails in even this initial step.<br /><br />As a result, man lives in a predominantly fallen world of near-animal existence.<br /><br />'The Psychology of the Transference' is one of the most concise and digestible books in Jung's oeuvre; its insights and wisdom are readily applicable to life in the 21st century.  As in the balance of his previous eighteen titles, Jung presents the world as an incredible place of breathtaking depth, mystery, and meaning, most of which is lost on the average man, who typically lives in a state of permanent hibernation from objective reality.<br /><br />However, Jung's worldview is also one in which nature is infinitely strange and capable of continuous unexpected manifestations, unique hybrid creations, and monsters, simply because the process of psychic evolution is not only something man must willingly confront, but because it is a process which nature inexorably demands.<br /><br />It is to Jung's credit that with 'The Psychology of the Transference' he is able to present his ideas in direct, palatable, and useful fashion without dilution.<br /><br />A world of readers are blindly searching for this book, and turning instead to authors like Herman Hesse and Carlos Casteneda, 'New Age' crank authors whose work is merely plagiarism of Jung, or lesser psychologists who offer up Jung's ideas in vastly diluted form.

Dick had shrewdly submitted and withdrawn so many hypothetical explanations for his chaotic life and unusual experiences that it made rational judgement and objective analysis impossible for those who were paying close attention. Many people actually were paying attention, and waiting a little too passively for his every next pronouncement on the divine.<br /><br />What is amazing today isn't the great number of fans his science fiction work has generated globally, but the increasing deification of Dick as an illuminated cyberpunk guru and Fortean poster boy of the first order.<br /><br />Certainly Dick documented his experiences more thoroughly, if not more clearly, than most; but since millions of people experience paranormal or metaphysical phenomena every year (or the probable many varied experiences which pass for it), and some year after year as Dick did, exactly how and why does Dick stand out from the rest?<br /><br />Lawrence Sutin's book, 'Divine Invasions: A Life of Philip K. Dick' (2005) doesn't attempt to answer this question, taking for granted as it does that Dick was a unique case and a genius; but it does given the general reader a broader overview of Dick's life than has thus far been available.<br /><br />Sutin states that he has respectfully declined to psychoanalyze or diagnose Dick; fair enough; but, considering the events of Dick's life, why not have given the finished text to a reputable psychiatrist for an opinion?<br /><br />Because Sutin, obviously an admirer of his subject, 'wants to believe,' as Dick did. Clearly, Dick, who believed his traumas at the hands of others began while still in the womb, had many legitimate physical, emotional and mental problems of a severe, documentable nature.<br /><br />While no psychiatrist's opinion is verity, in light of Dick's chronic drug addiction, institutionalizations, suicide attempts, and diagnoses of schizophrenia (his aunt was a catatonic schizophrenic), an objective analysis of the facts of Dick's life as it is currently understood would be helpful to fans, Forteans, and general readers alike. For those genuinely interested, separating the various facets of Dick's existence as carefully, cautiously, and sensitively as possible is a must, and the only proper route to an accurate understanding.<br /><br />Dick had been paranoid, emotionally infantile, codependent, and narcissistic all of his adult life when he suffered his first 'Valis' ('Valid?' 'Validation?') experience in 1972. He was also too blinded by his own unconscious egotism--which was everywhere in evidence--to consider that what he--an avowed Gnostic--had experienced may simply have been a miraculous manifestation of the divine.<br /><br />Mystifier Dick spent the next 9 years anguishing over his experiences in private and public, often sounding like the madman he may irregularly have been, and alienating friends and colleagues in the process.<br /><br />Though Dick claimed to be well-versed in Jung, he seems never to have applied himself to Jung's 'The Psychology of The Transference,' a book which concisely offers an explanation for Dick's visionary, archetypal experiences without in the least flattening them into dusty meaninglessness (Jung states: \\"The unconscious manifests itself in a sudden incomprehensible invasion.\\")<br /><br />Considering the hatred Dick harbored for his parents throughout his lifetime, it's unfortunate he didn't stringently apply himself to Freud as well, for the backward-looking, Oroborous-like Dick never tired of habitually swallowing his own tail.<br /><br />His vision of an immense evil face in the clouds--which he readily identified with his father--and his 'Valis' experiences--whatever else they may have been---point directly to both a highly charged and constellated father complex and a gaping maw of Freudian 'family romance.'<br /><br />Dick consciously recognized his morbid ties to his family, but blithely moved beyond these, rather foolishly favoring KGB agents, CIA mind control, strange beams from distant planets, orbiting satellites and shadowy conspiracies as the more likely culprits.<br /><br />Like a 1970s version of Richard Shaver, Dick went out on some very long, thin, and unsupportable limbs to attempt to justify his experiences, as if Plato's allegory of the cave had never entered the historical record.<br /><br />When the Christian god eventually manifests in a prolonged vision and establishes itself to Dick as the true force generating 'Valis,' Dick decides to accept this deity--for a few months anyway--but not before suggesting to 'God' that the two of them are one and equivalent.<br /><br />Dick completed over a million words of nonfiction speculation on the nature of these experiences, and Sutin writes that Dick's final estimation of 'Valis' was that \\"knowledge-not mere faith--as to the true 'hyper-structure' of the universe is possible.\\" However, that's something any intelligent, fairly well-educated person learns, knows, and accepts.<br /><br />Dick also seems to have conveniently failed to make the conspicuously obvious jump concerning psychic contamination. Before the 'Valis' incidents, he had written two novels (one, UBIK = 'Ubiquitous'?) which dealt with strange amorphorous godlike entities who intrude unexpectedly on mortal men with devastating results. Why then didn't he draw the more reasonable conclusion that the explanation for 'Valis' could be found within his imagination and himself?<br /><br />Dick was not the first creative personality to experience seemingly divine inspiration; from William Blake, Rainer Maria Rilke, and William Butler Yeats to Robert Frost, Keith Richards and Tori Amos, the phenomena is widely experienced, especially among creative people, but little studied or understood.<br /><br />Clearly an ardent fan of his subject, author Sutin occasionally presents his material in too subjective a fashion. Readers may also reject Sutin's following claims: that modern science fiction does not stem from the early work of Wells, Verne, Huxley and others; that Dick was the first novelist ever to mention the I-Ching in an American work of fiction (Sutin must have read several hundred thousand books to verify this); and, perhaps mistaking a publishing house for an audience, that William Burroughs is a 'mainstream' American writer.<br /><br />Most glaringly, Sutin repeats the global error of stating that 'Fred' in 'A Scanner Darkly' does not realize he is also Robert Arctor, the person Fred has been assigned to surveil.<br /><br />Fans of Dick's work, and especially those who share his seedy if prescient sensibilities, will find the book fascinating.

US	35944741	R19BFL2MEOXM9Q	0399509283	120445118	Drivers Seat	Books	5	38	42	N	N	The Art of Sensual Massacre	The bleakest of Muriel Spark's twenty-one novels, 1971's 'The Driver's Seat' provides its audience with a short, harrowing ride, one often without apparent course or destination.<br /><br />Written in uncomfortable second-person present, the reader becomes an immediate and hesitating witness to the last days in the life of Lise, the book's erratic, exacting, and strangely confrontational anti-heroine. 'The Driver's Seat' is, among other things, a piercing indictment of both the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of Western sixties culture and the radical break with traditional that the decade represented.<br /><br />Spark pulls off a clever literary coup in the opening paragraph of the third chapter, when she casually reveals the novel's catastrophic ending. By defusing the book's forward motion and the reader's expectations of reaching a climax in the routine manner, Spark forces the reader to look away from the narrative to understand the book's theme and meaning.<br /><br />Lise, 34, is a product of scrubbed clean and prepackaged modern society, and is or has become a kind of tight-lipped clockwork cog blandly caught in the dull hierarchical social and economic machinery of life. Emotionally sterile and spiritually vacant, only the briefest glimpses into the inner workings of Lise's mind are made available.<br /><br />However, Lise, who habitually erupts into unprovoked barking laughter, has had \\"years of illness\\" of the psychological kind, the results of which have left her office coworkers quietly terrified of her presence. Lise is a walking pathology, a brittle death's head effigy who is likely to collapse or collapse a building at any moment should her precarious self regulating control system fail.<br /><br />Lise is a shark fin cutting the surface of life, a breathing but not necessarily living crash-test dummy, a combustible wax work 'other' lacking a genuine human presence and an authentic resemblance to mankind. Spark hilariously underscores Lise's tragic monstrousness by giving her the Bride of Frankenstein's hairstyle, skunk stripe rising up from middlebrow to high pile above.<br /><br />Subtly coerced by her coworkers to take a vacation, Lise already has extensive plans to do so. She will travel by plane from her own unnamed northern country (probably Sweden) to an unnamed southern country (most likely Italy), leaving behind her modern pine-walled apartment, which has been constructed so that all furniture and appliances fold smoothly away into the walls (even the toilet). Lise keeps the few visible household trappings perfectly ordered and devoid of personal touches, leaving the apartment like a hotel room in a perpetual state of readiness for the next guest. Lise's home is her 'pine box.'<br /><br />Only elderly, sweet-natured, and met-along-the-way traveling companion Mrs. Fiedke, who can neither see nor hear properly, can stomach Lise's company as Lise searches endlessly for a \\"boyfriend\\" she is unable to recognize or describe.<br /><br />In an effort to assist, Mrs. Fiedke asks, \\"Will you feel a presence? Is that how you'll know?\\" \\"Not really a presence,\\" Lise famously replies, \\"the lack of an absence, that's what it is.\\" Strangely, Lise becomes briefly more human as the narrative winds to a close; she momentarily regrets the plan she has precipitated, even while there is still more than enough time to bring it to a halt. She misses \\"the lonely grief\\" of home, and offhandedly says, \\"I wished my parents had practiced birth control.\\" Readers will find Lise's brief manifestation of humanity starkly poignant.<br /><br />By revealing that Lise's present condition has been partially caused by her being \\"neither pretty or ugly,\\" and her continuing isolation due to her intrinsic status as a nondescript person in a world of mediocre, bland, and unremarkable people, Spark underscores the process by which some individuals perpetually overlooked as 'ordinary' can become extraordinary deviant and dangerous.<br /><br />Encouraging already indistinct members of society to assume generic personalities and rigid, conformist lifestyles, Spark seems to be saying, doesn't force the evolution of the New Man, but causes permanent spiritual deformities and creates abominations.<br /><br />'The Driver's Seat' is filled with eccentric characters, but unlike other Spark novels, there are no outright sinister eccentrics other than Lise. 'The Driver's Seat' equates evil with processed sterility and blankness rather than with the more traditional concepts of Christian sin and violation of grace and virtue.<br /><br />Here, vacuous stupidity (when Lise and Mrs. Fiedke are surrounded by cavorting hippies, shrewd Mrs. Fiedke says, \\"They are hermaphrodites. It isn't their fault\\"), solipsism, witless opinion, groundless protest, and trendy hedonism are merely the new norm, the to be expected detritus of newly-destabilized Western life.<br /><br />Even meek Mrs. Fiedke, representing the decaying old guard, believes all \\"homosexuals should be put on an island\\" and doesn't hesitate to say so. In 'The Driver's Seat,' both civilization and nature, both the old order and the new, are at a dead end.<br /><br />In an absurd world, can a person seize complete control of his or her destiny? If so, to what degree, and to how many possible outcomes? Can man successfully usurp God's role? These are the questions Spark raises and unsettlingly addresses here.<br /><br />A story of a woman in search of the perfect man, and of two people perfectly suited for one another finally meeting, 'The Driver's Seat' turns every fairytale notion about courting painfully upon its head.<br /><br />Upon finishing the book, Spark is said to have landed in the hospital, apparently suffering nervous strain and exhaustion, which gives potential readers a hint of its macabre power., conformist lifestyles, Spark seems to be saying, doesn't force the evolution of the New Man, but causes permanent spiritual deformities and creates abominations.

US	35944741	R3AEC4212FCAFS	0613218639	303161599	The King of Elfland's Daughter (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition) (Del Rey Impact)	Books	5	7	8	N	N	The Landscape By Which All Others Are Measured And Condemned	Lord Dunsany's 'The King of Elfland's Daughter,' first published in England in 1924, is a rare thing: both a literary classic and a highly influential fantasy novel.<br /><br />Primarily concerned with maintaining its remarkable and subtle mood, the book's action is largely painted in broadly-drawn strokes which may be too slow to meet the expectations of most genre fans.<br /><br />However, 'The King of Elfland's Daughter' regally demands its readers proceed at its own careful tempo; drowsy, somnolent, and poetic, its prose works quietly but confidently on the reader until he or she is pleasantly intoxicated and emotionally malleable.<br /><br />Since the quickening and halting of time is one of the book's central motifs, Dunsany doubly ensnares his audience, affording the even initially hesitant reader full entre into his moody twin worlds of Erl and Elfland.<br /><br />The king of Erl's son, Alveric, is sent by his father to Elfland to seize the Elf King's daughter and ask that she become his bride. Only a day's journey from the king's castle, Elfland is literally fairyland, a radiantly stark and shifting kingdom existing in full sight of humanity, but protected by a perpetually twilit borderland above which only the pale blue elvish mountains can be glimpsed.<br /><br />Dunsany's unmatched descriptions of Elfland's interior are extraordinarily beautiful and otherworldly; by cleverly tying the reality of Elfland to the reader's initial childhood perceptions and memories, Dunsany creates a fairyland which we've all known and participated in but have lost and only very vaguely remember.<br /><br />One of the constants of the book and its rightful theme is the perpetual lack of significant, emotionally meaningful verbal communication between the characters.<br /><br />The people of Erl and Elfland seem to speak as infrequently to one another as possible, and, unknowingly, always at rather than to one another when they do.<br /><br />Often, even the simplest words which could forestall tragedy go unspoken among the verbally discouraged inhabitants. Thus periods of personal happiness are dream states which have not as yet been shattered by knowledge; and dismay, regret, and melancholy inevitably arrive in the wake of brusque, honest communication, which is all the more brutal for having been so long delayed.<br /><br />The isolation and emotional solitude which surrounds everyone in both kingdoms is what gives the novel its poignancy. Only blunt, self-centered and happy-go-lucky border-jumping troll Lurulu, the novel's comic relief, seems free of sadness.<br /><br />There is very little evil in either Erl or Elfland; there are no villains, only conflicts between those who do not understand one another, hear only themselves, and thus fall to cross purposes.<br /><br />Except for the wise witch who lives high on the hill among the cabbages, all of the characters in 'The King of Elfland's Daughter' are a combination of naivete and self-concern for whom objectivity is impossible.<br /><br />Dunsany illustrates clashes between male and female temperaments, Christianity and paganism, tradition and originality, Erl and Elfland, hunter and hunted. In each case, neither is entirely in the wrong; but each lacks the ability to see as the other sees. Thus another of  the book's themes is an appeal for tolerance, empathy, clarity, and expanded individual perspective.<br /><br />In spite of a visceral, unexpected, and unusually specific scene involving the hunting of a unicorn, 'The King of Elfland's Daughter' is much closer in tone and scope to Ursula K. LeGuin's masterful 'A Wizard Of Earthsea' and its sequels than it is to Tolkien's coarser epic.<br /><br />However, readers can expect to find themselves immersed to the full in questors, witches, elfin knights, magic runes, moving trees, barren wastelands, disappearing kingdoms, strangling vines, enchanted farmers, talking animals and courtly love.<br /><br />Though the overall tone of thebook suggests early Winter, there are also glorious Springs in first flower, golden early-Autumn afternoons in the harvest fields, and, in Elfland, the eternal and unchanging face of magic, beyond all seasons, time, influence, and fluctuation.book suggests early Winter, there are also glorious Springs in first flower, golden early-Autumn afternoons in the harvest fields, and, in Elfland, the eternal and unchanging face of magic, beyond all seasons, time, influence, and fluctuation.	2002-08-21

Since its history is an extremely volatile and complex subject, in his preface Hutton is wisely modest about the present limits of the information available to scholars and the scope of his abilities and intentions--no promises to absolute knowledge are made.<br /><br />Hutton clearly realizes that his subject is a matter of belief and faith to Wicca's adherents, and therefore his careful conclusions are largely relative and theoretical. His writing style is plain-spoken and academic, his approach studiously matter-of-fact throughout.<br /><br />Since he is a historian and not a psychologist, Hutton steers away from any investigation of the archetypal witch image as a apparent constant of the human psyche and condition, focusing instead on whatever traceable elements of a genuine `witch tradition' and survival existed and exist in fact.<br /><br />Considering that witches appear both everywhere and nowhere throughout history, Hutton pulls off a remarkable piece of speculative detective work. He  remains uncommonly fair and open-minded throughout, considering all claims equally and going so far as to express that he does not deny the possibility that the gods and goddesses of Wicca--including Pan--exist objectively. If this is a simple placating measure, Hutton handles it with aplomb.<br /><br />The author states that the most important argument of his book is that Wicca is the result of a combination of cultural forces and undertones that have developed in England since 1800, including the Murray thesis as a erroneous theory and modern myth rather than as a hypothesis having any basis in fact.<br /><br />But it's not difficult to believe--by any means--that some remnant of pre-Christian religions existed in dynamic form during the Middle Ages, continued to be practiced and came to be identified as witchcraft by the dominant Christian establishment.<br /><br />This proposed pagan religion--presumably involving some form of 'nature worship'--may have not been a focused, formalized religion in fact, but something more akin to Ireland's 'fairy faith'--a powerful belief system that took a wide variety of forms in diverse parts of Europe.<br /><br />Since veneration of different aspects of nature as a means of insuring a bountiful harvest seems to be a fairly common and probably spontaneous phenomena among man when in the early stages of development, why should some trace of this not have continued into the Middle Ages among agrarian people?<br /><br />Murray may have been all wrong in her both carefully and carelessly accrued specifics, but at least partially correct generally.<br /><br />Though Carlo Ginzburg was apparently unclear about how his discovery of the \\"benandanti\\" in the Fruili region linked, if at all, to Murray's thesis, the example Hutton gives of the century-old witch community  on the Welsh island of Mon is fairly impressive, especially since he is able to identify at least three other 'pagan witch traditions' older than and apparently independent of Gardnerian Wicca.<br /><br />Among those who helped produce 'the pool of ideas and  impulses' which led or may have contributed to the formation of Wicca are key figures James Frazer, James Michelet, Margaret Murray, Charles Godfrey Leland, Samuel Liddell Mathers, Aleister Crowley, Gerald Gardner, and Dion Fortune, each of whose work Hutton carefully considers.<br /><br />Hutton clearly loves his subject; the reader senses that no one would secretly enjoy discovering solid proof of a pagan survival of this kind more than he.<br /><br />His sympathy, however, never compromises his rigorous scholarly  standards. This is a cautious, well-considered and erudite book that should educate most and offend few.is proposed pagan religion--presumably involving some form of 'nature worship'--may have not been a focused, formalized religion in fact, but something more akin to Ireland's 'fairy faith'--a powerful belief system that took a wide variety of forms in diverse parts of Europe.<br /><br />Since veneration of different aspects of nature as a means of insuring a bountiful harvest seems to be a fairly common and probably spontaneous phenomena among man when in the early stages of development, why should some trace of this not have continued into the Middle Ages among agrarian people?<br /><br />Murray may have been all wrong in her both carefully and carelessly accrued specifics, but at least partially correct generally.<br /><br />Though Carlo Ginzburg was apparently unclear about how his discovery of the \\"benandanti\\" in the Fruili region linked, if at all, to Murray's thesis, the example Hutton gives of the century-old witch community  on the Welsh island of Mon is fairly impressive, especially since he is able to identify at least three other 'pagan witch traditions' older than and apparently independent of Gardnerian Wicca.<br /><br />Among those who helped produce 'the pool of ideas and  impulses' which led or may have contributed to the formation of Wicca are key figures James Frazer, James Michelet, Margaret Murray, Charles Godfrey Leland, Samuel Liddell Mathers, Aleister Crowley, Gerald Gardner, and Dion Fortune, each of whose work Hutton carefully considers.<br /><br />Hutton clearly loves his subject; the reader senses that no one would secretly enjoy discovering solid proof of a pagan survival of this kind more than he.<br /><br />His sympathy, however, never compromises his rigorous scholarly  standards.

Though the story takes place just before World War II, the book is timelessly relevant in its illustration of power structures, protocol, and propriety among the powerful and power-mad.<br /><br />Powell also excels in illustrating how shrewd, calculating and talented individuals go about creating shining, influential, publically-adored and much-venerated, if entirely artificial, media personalities for themselves.<br /><br />Though Powell's work is often compared to that of Muriel Spark, there's literally a world of difference between their novels, though each filled their books with large casts of odd-ball characters and believable eccentrics.<br /><br />Spark's novels always take place in a world where God and the possibility of grace are always present, though sometimes only remotely so.<br /><br />Powell's comic novels take place in a universe in which the question of God has never even been raised; certainly none of Powell's characters ever give the idea of God or grace a first or second thought.<br /><br />In Powell's work, there is little more to the world than what meets the eye, and it is around its glittering prizes that her phlegmatic characters circle relentlessly.<br /><br />However, both Powell and Spark write brilliantly about servants and masters, and Powell does a hilarious job here of portraying Hurricane Amanda's servant, frustrated power monger Miss Bemel, who tries to seize control over events even as Amanda insist Miss Bemel buy herself a girdle.<br /><br />Insightful, perceptive, and almost perfectly structured, 'A Time To Be Born' is also entertainment of the highest form.with large casts of odd-ball characters and believable eccentrics.<br /><br />Spark's novels always take place in a world where God and the possibility of grace are always present, though sometimes only remotely so.<br /><br />Powell's comic novels take place in a universe in which the question of God has never even been raised; certainly none of Powell's characters ever give the idea of God or grace a first or second thought.<br /><br />In Powell's work, there is little more to the world than what meets the eye, and it is around its glittering prizes that her phlegmatic characters circle relentlessly.<br /><br />However, both Powell and Spark write brilliantly about servants and masters, and Powell does a hilarious job here of portraying Hurricane Amanda's servant, frustrated power monger Miss Bemel, who tries to seize control over events even as Amanda insist Miss Bemel buy herself a girdle.<br /><br />Insightful, perceptive, and almost perfectly structured, 'A Time To Be Born' is also entertainment of the highest form.	2002-08-06

Thankfully, novelist and critic John Updike has been a steady and dedicated Spark advocate since the Sixties, reviewing each of her books in the New Yorker upon release, thus vastly broadening her American audience.<br /><br />The story of a bright, individualistic, and defiant Scottish schoolteacher troublesomely employed by a restrictive conservative school for girls in 1930s Edinburgh, the novel moves effortlessly backward and forward in time, and though never less than buoyant in tone, has so many extremely subtle layers that it reads like an organic product of nature; nowhere does the reader sense an author's intruding hand or mind. Wise almost beyond reason, its gracious prose continually underscores a number of poetic, psychological, and spiritual truths that subtly illuminate the ostensibly simple story of Miss Brodie and her influence over six particular students.<br /><br />Initially structured around an act of betrayal and a question of identity, the answer to the mystery is casually given midway through the story, making it obvious to the undiscerning that the genuine focus of the novel lies elsewhere. Its complex themes of individuality, group identity, hero worship, sublimation, proxy relationships, and repression are effortlessly woven together and punctuated by symbolism so fine many readers may fail to perceive it at all.<br /><br />Less overtly funny than most of Spark's fictions, 'The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie' stands out distinctly from all of Spark's other works, perhaps because it is the most autobiographical of all her novels: with this work, Spark threw her fictional net wider than she ever had before or has since. An excellent introduction to her remarkable oeuvre, readers may find themselves reflecting endlessly on its meanings, nuances, and intentions. Ultimately, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie leaves the reader with more questions than answers: as in life, the larger mysteries remain.<br /><br />Recently chosen as one of the 100 greatest novels of the 20th Century, 'The Prime Of Miss Jean Brodie' is certainly that.ands out distinctly from all of Spark's other works, perhaps because it is the most autobiographical of all her novels: with this work, Spark threw her fictional net wider than she ever had before or has since.

Sadly, the conspirators were successful, and on that day the tabu system, gods, and idols--their entire centuries-old religious system--officially went into the fire forever.<br /><br />Author Kalakaua, a direct descendant of the royal line, was famous during his reign for attempting to reverse this cultural dissolution and return the full majesty of the ancient Hawaiian traditions back to prominence among his people.<br /><br />'The Legends And Myths Of Hawaii' was part of his effort, and, as such, has an important and dignified history. Throughout the volume, sensitive readers may sense the author's mental, emotional, and historical intimacy with his material. Only a hundred years before his book was published, the Hawaiian people were still 'pure,' free of Western influence, and living a relatively comfortable stone-age existence after fifteen centuries. .<br /><br />Beautifully introduced by R. M. Daggett and highly readable throughout, the text underscores the importance of honor, nobility of character, the warrior code, respect for self, family and nature, and finding the necessary balance between individual and communal needs. Sneakiness, pettiness, and selfishness are found to be disreputable qualities; facial beauty, excellent physical proportion, athletic ability, personal integrity, and joy in life are highly valued.<br /><br />As outlined by the tales, gender roles are traditional: men are expected to be masculine and honorable, whether warrior, sportsman, shaman, folk-singer, fisherman, or farmer. Women are observed to be behaving appropriately when warm, supportive, comforting, and pure of intention.<br /><br />Interestingly, though denied the better food under the tabu system, women are often portrayed as objects of veneration, worthy of the sacrifice of a man's life, and held as equals in love relationships. For both sexes, responsible and dedicated parenting is fundamental.<br /><br />These are vital, proud legends of heroes and heroines: their blood percolates through the book's pages.<br /><br />As one might expect, the stories are largely archetypal: there are quests, plagues upon the land, a high priest swallowed by a whale, and solar and lunar motifs. War and the conflicts that lead to war are a constant theme; gods, demi-gods, and goddesses are continually present.<br /><br />Though giants, evil spirits and monsters lurk under the sea, behind mountains and in trees and rocks, the writing is evenly balanced so just the suggestion of a hidden underwater cave, a long journey, an inter-family act of betrayal or a timeless, unconditional love creates the required interest and suspense.<br /><br />No single storytelling component is emphasized over another, and though each tale has an ethical point and lesson, the writing is never didactic. Each of the legends is enthusiastically told,and Kalakaua's terse descriptions of nature are simply beautiful.and Kalakaua's terse descriptions of nature are simply beautiful.	2002-07-17
US	35944741	R2WY85QAJ5QOPX	0316237213	102789269	Folklore on the American Land	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Pure, Unexpurgated Traditional American Folklore	'Folklore On The American Land' is one of prolific author Duncan Emrich's greatest contributions to American culture, history, and folklore. This book should be an essential item for librarians, educators, folklorists, historians, and roots musicians.<br /><br />Except for three relatively brief, informative text chapters ('American Folklore,' 'Some Guideposts,' and 'Folk Language and Grammar'), the balance of the book--the next 665 pages--is composed of such infrequently reproduced or catalogued subjects as \\"Quilt Names,' 'Murder Ballads,' 'Tales Told in the Gullah Dialect,' 'Nonsense Spelling,' 'Autograph Album Rhymes,' 'Cattle Brands,' 'Names of Ozark Fiddle Tunes,' 'Hound Dog Names,' 'Street Cries,' 'Folklore of Birth,'and a host of others. Each of the sections is briefly introduced and contextually framed by Emrich. In the lengthy song sections, the music as well as the lyrics are included.<br /><br />'Legends And Tales' includes material readily found in standard American folklore collections, such as the legends of Jesse James and General Custer, and the history of the American Santa Claus and cowboy traditions. Emrich was also well ahead of his time, as the volume includes a chapter on 'Urban Belief Tales,' now universally known as urban legends. Today, their discovery as a valid and apparently spontaneous folklore form is sadly attributed to others.<br /><br />Most if not all of the included material derives from the period before radio, when most Americans typically lived and worked in rural farming communities, grew and prepared their own food, built their own homes, and entertained themselves and one another by singing and musical instrumentation. For these generations, life was largely church-and-community based, slower, and less complex than it has been for generations since. The relative purity, pain, resourcefulness, hard work and beauty of the period is evident on every page.<br /><br />The generation that produced the baby boomers will remember and identify with much of the material included here. However, baby boomers will also easily recognize some of the material, especially from childhood and early school days. Originally published in 1972, when many of these products, activities, songs, stories, and traditions were already becoming lost to the American people, 'Folklore On The American Land' has become an even more necessarily, if not crucial, compendium as America moves rapidly into the 21st Century. The book is perfect for reading out loud to children, including in social groups, and bringing out at family gatherings. The book will not only spark preciously-guarded and near-forgotten memories, but lively conversations and debates as well.<br /><br />Beautifully illustrated with period photographs of hog-calling contests, quilting bees, grade school glee clubs, families praying before supper, 'mountain people' carrying a homemade coffin, crowds of men and women being baptized in a river, card players, food stands at country fairs, 'Chicago Saturday night,' and a wealth of others.<br /><br />'Folklore On The American Land' is a ticket to Grandma Moses country, earthy, wholesome, honest, and simple.identify with much of the material included here.

Books	5	107	117	N	Y	An Archetypal Folk Carnival	Erskine Caldwell's folk carnival 'Tobacco Road' (1932) documents the last days in the lives of Jeeter and Ada Lester, poverty-stricken and permanently befuddled sharecroppers living in rural Georgia during the Great Depression.<br /><br />The tragic elements, initially almost undiscernable, strike sharply and rapidly in quick lunges before vanishing again beneath the book's brilliant comic surface.<br /><br />The novel has an archetypal framework: Patriarch Jeeter, dispossessed of his ancestral land, upon which nothing will now grow but \\"broom sedge and scrub oak,\\" perpetually dreams of bringing his dead and depleted soil to life.<br /><br />While musing on his farm's infertility, and when not lusting after the women around him, Jeeter, a father of twelve, is preoccupied with ending his own ability to reproduce via self-castration. Like the Hanged Man of the Tarot, habitually procrastinating Jeeter is continually hamstrung and locked in the stupefying eternal moment.<br /><br />Caldwell is particularly cruel in drawing his female characters: simple-minded and otherwise beautiful daughter Ellie May has a disfiguring harelip; man-crazy, self-appointed preacher Bessie has a good figure and a set of nostrils but no nose, the unnamed, unspeaking grandmother is starved by the other family members, who will no longer acknowledge her; struggling wife Ada, who has not always been faithful, dreams only of having a dress of correct length and current style to be buried in; and twelve year-old child bride Pearl has lost the will to speak and sleeps on the floor to avoid her adult husband's sexual advances.<br /><br />In contrast, Jeeter and handsome teenage son Dude are merely imbecilic, gullible, and grossly self-serving.<br /><br />All of the characters are God-fearing and largely well-intentioned towards one another, though uneducated and of extremely limited consciousness: they are guiltless of malice, if not of responsibility.<br /><br />In a scene intended to shock, newlyweds Dude and Bessie accidentally kill a Black man, but think nothing of it.<br /><br />But this blank, spontaneous indifference to reality and the reality of other people is what makes the 'Tobacco Road' hilariously funny.<br /><br />The ancient grandmother meets a painful and grueling death through another careless accident with the car; Jeeter discusses Ellie May's disfigurement in front of her without the slightest regard for her feelings; Bessie, perpetually in heat, nearly rapes unwilling, unresponsive, 16 year-old Dude; car salesmen gather to enthusiastically stare down Bessie's nostril holes and insult her; Jeeter attacks his son-in-law and steals the bag of turnips he walked has seven miles to obtain; Ellie May casually masturbates in the front yard; the whole family gathers, tribe-like, to watch Dude and Bessie make awkward love on their wedding night; the Lesters destroy a new  automobile (a symbol of the modern, productive, urbanized world they will never be a part of) within a few days due to recklessness and the family tradition of being unable to respect and maintain any material possession.<br /><br />Like many of the characters in Muriel Spark's novels, the cast of 'Tobacco Road' are only vaguely aware, if aware at all, of themselves as moral, spiritual, or ethical beings, despite the occasional religious trappings around them.<br /><br />This lack of moral awareness, \\"and the comedy that arises from it\\" is what fuels 'Tobacco Road.'<br /><br />Caldwell has written the lightest of black comedies, and it is to his credit that he is capable of allowing his audience to embrace and enjoy these occasionally vigorous lost souls, even though only tragedy seems to lay ahead for all.<br /><br />The universal literary and commercial success of 'Tobacco Road' in 1932 (the novel was adapted into a long-running Broadway play, and a bowdlerized John Ford film in 1941) gave new life to the country bumpkin genre in the 20th-century.<br /><br />Its success helped usher in the Ma And Pa Kettle films, the Li'l Abner comic strip, some of Tennessee William's short stories, and classic American television series such as 'The Andy Griffith Show' (1960-1968), 'The Beverly Hillbillies' (1962-1971), 'Petticoat Junction' (1963-1970), and 'Green Acres' (1965-1971).<br /><br />Despite the many ways in which sexual intentions go awry throughout the novel, 'Tobacco Road' has a natural, healthy approach to sexuality, as does 'God's Little Acre,' the equally-successful book which followed it.<br /><br />In this age of political correctness and sexual suspiciousness, the book's vibrant acceptance of sexuality as one of life's givens is admirable.<br /><br />Some Southerners, at the time of its publication and continuing to the present, have objected to the book as an indictment of Southern culture. But 'Tobacco Road' is clearly a soulful high satire, and its characters are intentionally caricatures of the basest order.<br /><br />Ultimately, 'Tobacco Road' is a novel which seductively illuminates and instructs while it seamlessly entertains.her in the Ma And Pa Kettle films, the Li'l Abner comic strip, some of Tennessee William's short stories, and classic American television series such as 'The Andy Griffith Show' (1960-1968), 'The Beverly Hillbillies' (1962-1971), 'Petticoat Junction' (1963-1970), and 'Green Acres' (1965-1971).<br /><br />Despite the many ways in which sexual intentions go awry throughout the novel, 'Tobacco Road' has a natural, healthy approach to sexuality, as does 'God's Little Acre,' the equally-successful book which followed it.<br /><br />In this age of political correctness and sexual suspiciousness, the book's vibrant acceptance of sexuality as one of life's givens is admirable.<br /><br />Some Southerners, at the time of its publication and continuing to the present, have objected to the book as an indictment of Southern culture.

US	35944741	RBOLP3MBQLKDW	0399226877	549585867	The Legend of Sleepy Hollow	Books	5	12	12	N	Y	A Folk Artist's Reconception Of America's Classic	Will Moses' illustrated retelling of Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow rivals Arthur Rackham's near century-old version as the best edition of the book ever published. The Rackham version, with its moody, archetypal illustrations, has the slight edge, as it contains Irving's full original text in addition to Rackham's spectacular artwork.<br />However, Moses's simplification of the narrative is masterfully executed, and the colorful, playful, and numerous paintings which adorn the book have a warm period charm of genuine Americana. Moses portrays the Hudson River Valley as a lush  expansive valley not unlike the Garden of Eden on the first day of creation. Happy farmers, their wives and children, cows, geese, ducks and pigs frolic together amid fields of wheat and corn; galleons approach dramatically from the river; and the Catskill Mountains, sun, and sky suggested an infinite panorama and endless horizon full of promise.<br />The story tells us that the Dutch colonists were a superstitious lot, and that the Sleepy Hollow region itself was or seemed to be under a spell of some kind. The farmers and their wives suspected witchcraft; strange music was heard in the air; visions were seen; and the inhabitants themselves lived their lives in a kind of continuous dreamy revery. These tales and superstitions give rise to the legend of the headless horseman, said to be the ghost of a Hessian soldier who lost his head to a canon ball in the war, and now nightly prowling the region in search of it. Moses' nocturnal landscapes of the swamps, hills and the Old Dutch Cemetery under a bright harvest moon are particularly effective. Significantly, these stark, haunted landscapes do not violate the spirit of the book, but enrich its sense of wonder.<br />Moses' Ichabod is a cheerful but somewhat hapless fellow, confident and foolish in equal parts. His Katrina is a strong but innocent blond beauty, and a friend to children. Brom Bones is an appropriately square-shouldered, square-jawed hooligan, rowdy and full of mischief, if not absolute spite.<br />Anyone familiar with the tale knows that it is not a horror story but a folktale, a fireside spook story, and a `legend' as Irving, writing here as Diedrich Knickerbocker, himself called it. This edition of the book is appropriate for children but is equally suitable for adults. Highly recommended.ouldered, square-jawed hooligan, rowdy and full of mischief, if not absolute spite. <br />Anyone familiar with the tale knows that it is not a horror story but a folktale, a fireside spook story, and a `legend' as Irving, writing here as Diedrich Knickerbocker, himself called it.

'Diedrich' penned 'The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow' and 'Rip Van Winkle,' as well as short stories 'Wolfert Weber,' 'The Devil And Tom Walker,' 'Kidd The Pirate,' and 'Dolph Heyliger.' Irving achieved magic whenever he wrote, but when he steps into Knickerbocker's antique Dutch shoes, the combination of humor, history and folklore that results is unique, sweeping, and highly entertaining.<br /><br />Few writers could or would dare to write the kind of poetic sentences Irving could, such as \\"the inhabitants were of primitive stock, and had itermarried and bred in and in, never swarming far from the parent hive.\\"<br /><br />All lovers of American literature and history, and of Americana generally, should know this delightful, warm and amusing book. Too often today, when addressing the origins of American literature, names like Hawthorne and Poe are raised, but Irving came first and was in fact the first American writer ever to be taken seriously by Europeans (it was Hawthorne and Poe that paid lip service to Irving, who was born a full 21 years before Hawthorne and 26 years before Poe). Some historians and critics go so far as to credit Irving with the creation of the short story as a literary form; he was also the U.S. ambassador to Spain, a world traveler, a biographer of George Washington, and at one time requested to run for mayor of New York City (an invitation he kindly declined).<br /><br />Thanks largely to Irving, the New York City and Hudson River Valley areas have a thriving plethora of myth and folklore all their own. America owes the dynamic, magnanimous and prolific Irving a great debt, which decade after decade it neglect to pay or acknowledge.<br /><br />'Knickerbocker's History of New York' is not difficult reading, though it is too advanced for children and most teenagers. However, any young adult or adult with a love of American history, particularly with an interest in the founding of our country or the American Revolution specifically, will find it fascinating.

Silver's 'Strange & Secret Peoples: Faries & Victorian Consciousness' (2000) is the best serious book on the subject of fairies and fairy lore to be published since Patrick Harpur's broader, belief-based study, 'Daemonic Reality' (1994).<br /><br />Silver believes that the Victorian love of fairy-themed plays, stories, paintings, and operettas actually reflected several dark and ugly obsessions for which the fairies were perfect symbols and potent conduits. These included mistrust of female sexuality and independence, fear of racial contamination, and a horror for birth deformity and child-stealing. For Silver, all Victorian thought and feeling on and for fairies had a decidedly downward pull. The fairies were not only easily and readily dismissible: they were something to actively fear.<br /><br />Not all of Silver's chapters are equally good, but the author has a keen methodical writing style and a thorough understanding of the abundance of material she has gathered together. Especially satisfying are Silver's citings of fairy-related stories by neglected authors Algernon Blackwood, Arthur Machen, Fiona MacLeod and others; Silver briefly summarizes each story and places it within its sociological and historical context.<br /><br />The major problem with Silver's work is the relentless political correctness, which rears its head whenever the author approaches a 'sensitive' issue; Silver would have been wiser to hold herself to a higher intellectual standard. It is fairly difficult to believe that, thirty-five years ago, she would have so heavily underscored the same objections she does here.<br /><br />Is it really so difficult to understand how and why African pygmy tribes 'discovered' by Victorians were initially suspected to be less than fully human? Instead of allowing those scientists credit for the groundbreaking work they did, and allowing for--or at least rationally acknowledging--the genuine scientific ignorance of their time, Silver approaches the subject with a highbrow  &#34;I shudder to think&#34; attitude which seems like willful historical stupidity itself.<br /><br />The same applies to her awkward chapter on swan maidens: Silver writes defensively, as if exploring and elaborating upon the misogyny of the Victorian era will be misconstrued as her own misogyny, merely because the author is addressing the subject.<br /><br />Though it takes itself and its subject too seriously on occasion, this is the best book likely to be published on the subject for some time.

Though far less common today, the \\"fairy faith\\" still thrives throughout the world, as several articles in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal recently made clear.<br /><br />Charming, colorful, and occasionally bizarre without being in the least sentimental, 'Visions & Beliefs In The West of Ireland' is required reading for anyone seriously interested in the supernatural or Irish cultural history. The fairies described here vary in appearance, but in most cases are more akin to the image of the Christian angel than to the 'flower fairy' or gnome of modern popular imagination.<br /><br />Never winged, only sometimes small or short, and often the size of an average man or larger, the beings observed in these recountings (or perceived but unseen \\"all around us, as thick as the grass,\\" as one man says) steal milk, kidnap babies, haunt roads, wells, and shorelines, prefer human women to act as midwives for their newborns, and require human participation to play their games and fight their wars.<br /><br />Who or what is the Fool of the Fort? Why May and June are the most dangerous months of the year? How does one free one's self from enchantment if pixie-led? What happens on May Day's Eve? How does one recognize a fairy doctor? Are babies perceived as changelings in fact sick or deformed children? This volume addresses these questions and a hundred more.<br /><br />As a vision-based collection of folklore, and of actual fact as the rural Irish peasant farmers perceived it, 'Visions & Beliefs In The West of Ireland' deserves the highest praise for its purity of style, method, and intention. The more imagination the reader has, the more the book, with its incredible descriptions, will expand in mind and memory.This volume addresses these questions and a hundred more.<br /><br />As a vision-based collection of folklore, and of actual fact as the rural Irish peasant farmers perceived it, 'Visions & Beliefs In The West of Ireland' deserves the highest praise for its purity of style, method, and intention.
