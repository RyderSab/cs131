Rodeo By Roxanne Rustland<br />Jake Landers has been a cowboy since he was eighteen. The rodeo folk bull riders, bull fighters, clowns, announcers, producers and contractors are like a second family to him. Now thanks to an injury he is in danger of losing more then his chance to compete again.<br />Buying a rodeo company is his chance to get back into the life he loves. But he needs the former owner's daughter to teach him the ropes. But Jake has a problem the owner's daughter is Kristen Davis and Jake left her standing at the altar waiting for him 10 ten years before.<br />Now Jake has to convince her to travel with him for the next five months. He has to do this without breaking a promise he made and revealing dark secrets from the past.<br /> This is my first read by Roxanne Rustland Ms. Rustland characters are very believeable Kristen was very strong despite the obstacles she faced being a a woman in rodeo and Jake was a charmer and a great leading man. Kristen is a bit stand offish at first when Jake walks into to her office and announces that he is the buyer of Mid-America Rodeo Company or MRC. As they spend time together Jake's natural charm starts to win her over again and they develop a beautiful relationship. I loved the supporting characters as well.  Jake's younger brother Tucker who is eighteen and has a huge chip on his shoulder and Kristen's parents who after all the years realize how much they truly mean to each other Bud and Tina a couple who has been with MRC for years and last but not least Dixie a photographer and Kristen's best friend. There is even a secondary romance between Dixie and Clint a man she has loved all her life I enjoyed their story as well. This book is any all around good read and I look forward to more titles from Roxanne Rustland in the future	2003-01-05

He treated her poorly because he didn't realize what he had and that was what I liked about this book it was not a perfect romance far from in fact and that is the reality that some woman deal with great read.

I consider this book to be one of the best I have ever read I have been reading Terry McMillian since 2000 and I have to say she has not written a book yet that was disappointing. This novel has a character for everyone of my family members and when I was reading it I was relating to these characters on a personal level that is truly amazing that I was able to do that with a novel because with most novels I'm unable to get that depth but this one was different. It was such a great novel that I recommended it to my Mom and Aunt and my Aunt is currently reading and loving ever moment of it. I consider this to be a keeper	2003-01-01

I was happy with the fact that DS made him work at it instead of having him say some meaningful things about the mother Sarah leaving and the kids accepting it and everything going smoothly we all know there are bound to be some troubles the perfect example is Ben the oldest son getting his girlfriend pregnant.  I was REALLLY happy when the father Oliver got his second chance just like Sarah took hers I found myslef hating the mother for putting her children in that situation what kind of mother does that but on the other hand being a woman I understand her actions she wanted to know when was it going to be her turn? To live life without having to worry about kids and a husband or what to make to for dinner? I loved this book and I think everyone should read it.	2002-12-29

This is by far the best Nora Roberts book I have read aside from True Betrayal I love Olivia and Noah's romance and I had no idea who the killer was I suspected several other people and I was utterly shocked when the killer was revealed. When the killer is revealed I started to see how it could of been that person the book gave you several clues I had not noticed before and when I was able to think back it was all right there in my face. This is a excellent whodunit novel because up until the last pages you have no idea. I recommend this as a must read Nora Roberts<br />This book will make you a fan of her work for life	2002-12-28

US	38507877	R3R7GEHHNQJ26W	0671884484	747702164	Mama	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Expeptional Read	My mom referred this novel to me recently because she felt I was old enough to understand some of the more explicit content in the novel.  I was immensely pleased that I was given the chance to read it my mom read it several times and absolutely loved it and now I know why. Mildred the main character is a single mother with 5 children (4 daughters Freda,Bootsey,Angel,and Doll) an a son Money and she had a lying abusvie husband Crook (which in my opinion is a an appropriate name for him) considering his actions towards Mildred were appalling the fact that Mildered fought back was endearing to me and I cheered her for it.  It seems to me that after Crook left Mildred's living situation declined a bit but in life everyone has troubles and her endeavors to make a better life for her and children in the beginning was great.  I was dismayed though by the fact that Mildred seemed to need a &quot;man&quot; in her life to make herself feel better I mean couldn't her children have been enough for her but on the other hand a woman sometimes wants to feel wanted by somene other then her children.  I recommend this book to everyone who has had a hard time in the life at some point and if you are not a fan of Terry McMillian then this book will make you a fan.	2002-11-07

I was a bit surprised and pleasantly amazed to discover that I was indeed reading a romance novel in (some parts) but with a different spin on old fashion romance.  This book to say the least is  a &quot;Page Turner&quot; I was intrigued with the main characters Maris, Parker,and Noah and their connections and intercations with one another Maris and Parker have sometimes humorous exchanges with each other were as Maris and Noah have some bitter and tense moments and I found myself hating him and his attiude toward his peers this attutide in my opinion lead him to his downfall and he was powerless to stop it from happening.  This book made me feel like I was there when Parker described Key West I could almost feel the humdity and smell the salt in the air from the water.  This was a great read and I recommanded it to everyone who is a Sandra Brown Fan I plan to read more of her books	2002-10-26
