With Earth testing children to see who will be their next great military leader to battle an alien race called the buggers, Ender Wiggin stands out from the crowd.  While his grasp of military strategy is incredible, it's his inner conflict that will engross the reader.  There are times when Ender loves the war games at Battle School, when it seems he is forming a solid core of friends.  But the more Ender succeeds, the more the teachers at Battle School make his life a living hell.  Advancing him quicker than normal students, presenting him with almost impossible odds to overcome, all in an effort to see if he can be broken.  At times, it looks like they'll succeed.  Through this the transformation of Ender is incredible.  Despite his genius, we see how lonely he is, even how he sometimes longs to return home to a dysfunctional family and a psychotic brother.  The last 80 pages have so many incredible revelations that you'll be scooping your jaw off the floor over and over again.	2004-06-28

Bart Drak was portrayed as what I feel is your typical elite soldier.  He's not Superman, he's not Rambo.  Just a guy whose life is the Army and is completely dedicated to the beings he leads.  I really liked the training part of the novel, as it showed the difficulties of putting together a combat unit of various aliens with their own cultural differences, ideosyncracies and prejudices.  Still Drak finds ways to bring them together as a unit.  The second part of the story focuses on the invasion of Olviat, a world held by the Ilion Federation.  There's no &quot;storm the secret lab/command center/etc to end the war&quot; type stuff.  It just shows the small, but important roles, Drak's squad plays in the overall campaign.  The combat scenes were cool, as well as the futuristic technology.  My only complaint is that the aliens were too anthropomorphic in their description.  Still this does not detract from the quality of the story.	2004-06-16

Freakin' awesome!  I've seen Dirk Pitt in some unbelieveable life and death situations, but this time Cussler outdid himself.  Setting Pitt, his buddy Al Giordino and Maeve Fletcher (the very nice estranged daughter of the very evil Arthur Dorsett) out to sea on an unpowered boat, then watching the three use all their wits to survive made for some of the most intense and jaw dropping scenes in the book.  Dorsett is definitely among my favorite Cussler villains.  He and his other two daughters were some of the most depraved people Cussler has ever come up with.  I also really liked the more prominent role NUMA boss Admiral Sandecker took on as he circumvented the White House in order to stop Dorsett's mining operation before it kills millions.  You really see how far Sandecker will go in order to do the right thing.  An incredible and emotional end as Pitt and company assault Dorsett's island.  I've always said Cussler can spin one hell of a tale, and in &quot;Shockwave&quot; he did not disappoint.	2004-05-24

Tolkien writes somewhat light-hearted, almost like he's sitting down with you telling a story.  And the story is excellent.  He goes into more detail about hobbits and elves and their societies than you get in the LOTR movies.  Bilbo Baggins is so hesitent to go on this adventure with Gandolf and the dwarves (Hobbits aren't supposed to have adventures), but the more situations he gets into, the more inner strength and creativity he finds.  The adventures through the Mirkwood and the escape from the Wood Elves were thrilling.  The description of the Mirkwood was done well and you get a good feel how dark and forboding the place is.  Tolkien really brought the characters alive.  The Battle of the Five Armies was more an overview than a detailed fight.  Still it was really good and if they ever make a movie out of The Hobbit it will be one of the greatest movie battle scenes ever.  Now I can't wait to check out the LOTR novels.	2004-03-23

And The Mission is probably a little more involved of a story than the previous two.  Besides finding out there are groups that are in cahoots with the alien Airlia, there's also a devastating plague spreading throughout South America.  I loved all the obstacles Doherty put in the way of Special Forces Captain Mike Turcotte in trying to find out who's responsible for the plague and how to stop it.  At times you seriously wonder if he and his buddies are going to get out of this alive.  Then there are the always cool re-writes of history that show how much of an influence the Airlia have had on humanity, including starting the Black Death in the Middle Ages and pushing the Inquisition.  Some pretty decent action too, especially the assault on Devil's Island.  Look forward to continuing on with this series.	2004-02-15

His battle scenes were written so well I didn't want to put the book down when I got to them.  The entire downfall of North Korea takes 80-90 pages to get through, but with missiles flying, a &quot;true-believer&quot; Commie missile battery commander trying to preserve the spirit of the revolution and the US Vice President caught in the middle, you can't help but keep reading until the whole thing's over.  <br />Good job with the characters again.  Many familiar faces in this one, including Becky Furness, the lady bomber pilot we last saw in &quot;Chains of Command.&quot;  The most intersting character has to be Rinc Seaver.  He is a bit of an enigma when it comes to his motivation and his relationships with the rest of the cast, but that's what makes him so interesting.  He also spends much of the book dealing with a training accident that killed two crew members.  Creates quite a bit of tension among the people in his B-1 squadron.<br />As usual, Brown throws a whole lot of way cool high tech weapons at you.  I will agree with one point some have made.  I think Brown glossed over the impact of using nukes and chem weapons on the Korean Peninsula.  Besides the obvious political ramifications, all the fallout would severely effect the whole of Korea, and most likely surrounding countries.  I wish that and the actual devestation they caused to Korean cities was touched on a lot more.  But that's really my only big complaint with this novel.  Other than that, total thumbs up.	2004-01-25

Smith and Rusch have crafted a very cool story about a rogue planet that comes into Earth's orbit every 2,006 years and wreaks havoc.  One of the best aspects of the book is the path the characters take in trying to figure out all they can about the Tenth Planet and what it will do when it gets here.  Pretty good character development, especially with the two archeologists, Cross and Bradshaw.  While Cross is more ready to take a risk than others, Bradshaw is cautious to the point of fear.  This is because of a finding he made 20 years prior that ruined his reputation.  The aliens were handled very nicely.  Not you typical evil alien conquerors.  I really enjoyed the scenes from their points of view.  And man, are they freaky looking things!  The climax wasn't bad, and I am looking forward to reading the other books in the trilogy.	2004-01-01

A carrier submarine taking on a race of undersea aliens who apparently are responsible for the disappearance of several American citizens in a small Pacific country.  One thing I did like about the story is we really didn't know much about the aliens.  We always saw them through the eyes of the Shenandoah crew, who had to make some calculated guess on how these creatures operate.  Not as much action as I expected, but the story was handled pretty well.  I did have a problem with Stine's overuse of exclamation points.  55% of normal conversations ended with these marks, making it appear the characters were constantly shouting at each other.	2003-12-14

I'd really like to see more of the SEAL trio -- James, Beau &amp; H.J.  With James getting crapped on, Beau the wise-cracker and H.J. trying to prove herself as a lady SEAL, a lot of interesting things could happen.  The plot to rid the Med of American influence was pretty good, especially since it's carried out by one sharp, evil Libyan colonel.  A very good adversary for the U.S. to face.  Some of the best scenes involved the Algerian revolution, especially with the loyalists trying to get the President out of the country while encountering all sorts of hairy situations.  I really enjoyed the battle scenes at the end.  Very fast-paced and well done.  Looking forward to the rest of the Sixth Fleet books.	2003-11-27

It was interesting to look at some of the ways people in the Heartland lived during the Depression (Bloyd's house had no running water or electricity).  His journey through air training was quite an experience.  Amazing how the Army can really find ways to screw you, from bitter instructors to telling you they don't need you flying a certain aircraft after you've just qualified on it.  He did talk about some pretty hairy experiences, from flying through storms to getting bounced by flak to having German Me-262 jet fighters blast through his formation.  Quite a few times I would have liked Bloyd to go into more detail about those events.  Bottom line, he had some good descriptions, but not to the point where I felt I was in the cockpit with those guys.  Same with some of his stories on the ground.  Good stuff, but a little more detail would have really rought it to life.<br />Still, it certainly is an enjoyable read.	2003-11-10

A ex-Navy SEAL, an ex-member of the U.S. Ski Team, and now a Secret Service agent who takes it upon himself to save the kidnapped U.S. President when everyone else is looking in the wrong direction.  The best thing is Harvath is not a superman-type hero.  He's got the same worries and fears that anyone would have in his situation.  Plus this guy just gets messed up throughout this book.  Buried under an avalanche, shot, beat up, thrown into a freezing river.  Still, Harvath's never quit attitude sees him through the situation.  Lots of great action scenes, especially in the beginning when a group of mercenaries carry out their brilliant plan to kidnap the President.  Good suspense and good flow to the story.  I'm looking forward to more Brad Thor books in the future.	2003-10-12

When a nuclear war wipes out a good chunk of Earth's population, Israel is relatively untouched and helps America fight its wars in exchange for a place to live.  Now a group of Israeli and American soldiers face a tough challenge.  Rescue the kidnapped President of the United States from Texas, which has seceded from the Union.  <br />It's a quick read with OK character development and decent action.  I really liked the laser-armed Israeli Centurion tanks duking it out with a Texas heavy cruiser.  Also, a first-rate job by the authors bringing out the harshness, and hopelessness, of a post-apocalypse world, from contaminated farmland to cities no longer maintained.  The characters in many instances are torn between their dreams for life after fighting, then wonder if they will live long enough to see them or if they can even make a life in this miserable world.  Some really good scenes when the Israelis ad Americans infiltrate the Texan compound.  They learn of the conflict between the regular Texan Army and the fanatical faction called the Sons of the Alamo.  One great aspect was the Israeli commander's view of one Texan general who comes off as an honorable warrior, leading the Israeli to dislike the idea that he may have to kill him in order to complete his mission.	2003-09-21

After reading two other Plum books, it was fun to see how it all began for Stephanie.  I sort of see Steph as a female version of Charlie Brown.  She's always screwing up (which is half the fun of these novels), but refuses to give up in her endeavours.  Excellent pace to the story with lots of weird things happening to poor Stephanie, from being handcuffed to a shower rod to being stalked by a psycho serial rapist boxer.  I also loved the weird relationship she establishes with Joe Morelli, helping him while at the same time trying to collect on his bounty.  Just read it and see.  There were also some pretty entertaining scenes with Steph's wacko family.  Her gold medal-class worrier of a mother, her father who just goes through life shaking his head in disbelief at his family, and my favorite, Grandma Mazur, who simply refuses to act her age.  Take it from a native of the Trenton area, you'll dig this book.	2003-08-30

All the people involved were brought to life, their courage, fears and worries all on display.  Many of the combat scenes were well written, showing how hunting Japanese ships could turn into an all-day affair, and the frusrtation at times when torpedoes miss or malfuction.  You felt the fear and the jolts of depth charge attacks, always wondering if the next one would have your name on it.  I also liked how Tuohy highlighted all the problems that plagued the sub service, from malfunctioning torpedoes to inept and vain commanders, to sub skippers having to be relieved because they crack under pressure.<br />Dick O'Kane was not superman.  He was just a dedicated guy who took his job seriously and did whatever it took to hurt the Japanese.  It was also something to see how innovative O'Kane and his ilk were.  When you're all alone in the middle of hostile territory, you gotta do what you can in order to survive.<br />All in all, a great testament to the men who sacrificed so much so we can enjoy our freedom today.	2003-08-18

He has written some terrific books like &quot;The Red Horseman&quot; and &quot;Under Seige.&quot;  Unfortunately, &quot;Saucer&quot; wasn't up to his usual snuff.  I liked the premise, but the characters seemed flat and the dialogue rather unnatural.  There wasn't a lot of inner thought to really bring out the characters and strengthen the story.  I still think Coonts is an awesome writer, but even Barry Bonds strikes out every so often.	2003-07-20

He did an excellent job getting into the characters' heads as an armed confrontation between the Federal Government and the State of Idaho spins out of control.  A very big role played by Nancy Kozak (now a LTC in the Idaho National Guard).  More than in any previous book Kozak shows off her leadership abilities and smarts as she does everything in her power to resolve the crisis.  I really liked the way Coyle handled young Lt. Nathan Dixon.  Just a few weeks removed from training and he jumps with the rest of the 17th Airborne to secure an Idaho NG base, which was the best battle scene in the book.  After Dixon and his platoon become lost, he struggles mightily to be the best leader that he can, though he is constantly plagued with self-doubt.  Throughout the book you keep asking yourself is this the right course of action (for both sides)?  How far would you go in a fight for freedom?  You can even see valid points on both sides, but you also wonder is it necessary to kill fellow Americans in an armed conflict over them?<br />One thing Coyle could have done better, though, was give more detail into Idaho's problems over the way the Feds were handling the arrest and prosecution of the Militia members they believe responsible for the bombing of the Kansas City federal building at the beginning of the book.  Besides that, keep up the good work, Mr. Coyle.	2003-07-20

Some of the changes were not for the better.  Harry's success and small fortune begins to put a strain on his friendship with Ron, who is also not happy that a wizard from another school is showing interest in Hermoine.  All this while Harry is dealing with his unexpected entry into the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  This added tension was a great addition to the story and brought out all the faults any 14-year-old (Wizard or Muggle) has stored up.  The events in the tourament made for many exciting moments.  The end was rather surprising, and now I can't wait to read Book 5.	2003-07-16

What happens to the sinister Psi Cop Al Bester.  The book went in a different direction than expected, but that's not a complaint.  You learn a lot about Bester's character, aspects you'd never expect from someone so vile.  First off, he becomes involved with a non-telepath woman while hiding out in Paris . . . and Bester is as bigoted against normal humans as you can get.  His love for Louise is real, and makes him re-think his life on the run and all the horrible things he's done.  Bester actually showing remorse!  Who would have guessed?  The man also has a cultured side to him.  He loves wine, art and literature, and even becomes a literary critic for a small Parisian newspaper.  But just when you think Bester has become an okay person, situations arise that force him to revert to his old ways.  <br />The climax was awesome.  I loved the final confrontation between Garibaldi and Bester.  There was also a fantastic mind battle between Bester and another P12 telepath.  Very descriptive.  You could really feel Bester's pain.<br />If you are a B5 fan and don't have this book, get it.	2003-06-14

Not only do we see the actual fighting, but we see what goes on behind the lines.  Canadians living under U.S. rule, working women dealing with rationing and Western Union death notices and a Socialist woman doing what she can to end the war.  The Confederates also have a major problem besides the USA.  The blacks in the South have begun a full-scale Socialist Revolution.  Turtledove also shows off new inventions thrown into the war, such as flamethrowers and tanks (called barrels by the USA)  No matter what side of the conflict his characters are on or what their beliefs are, they are written in such a way that you can't help but care about them.	2003-06-13

They come from support units such as intelligence and Transportation Command.  While TRANSCOM Colonel Williams tries to find out what's happened to a hijacked shipment of advanced cruise missiles, Intel weenie Colonel Underwood is trying to deal with the internal politics of the CIA and the White House.  Both men are stark contrasts.  Williams is a stand-up family man who is not afraid of doing grunt work.  Underwood is hot and cold.  While you can sympathize with some problems in his personal life, there are times he comes off as rather self-serving.  His emotions are thrown into turmoil when he finds himself thrust in the middile of the hijackers conspiracy.  FBI Agent Carolyn Younghart added a hard edge to the story as she helps Williams investigate the cruise missile theft.  I did feel that the end lacked a lot of drama and left quite a few loose ends.	2003-05-11

Coonts hooks you in the first couple chapters as a new SDI satellite goes missing before it can achieve orbit.  If that weren't bad enough, a group of Russian and German mercenaries hijack the most advanced submarine in the world, the USS America.  Some pretty good action scenes.  I liked how Coonts brought out the sense of disaster when Tomahawks armed with electro-magnetic warheads are used on major American cities.  Good job on the characters.  The most memorable had to be Kolnikov, the Russian who hijacks America.  A stern skipper who at the same time always levels with his crew.  He's super shrewd and often times doesn't seem to care if he lives or dies.  Jake Grafton comes off as an everyman with one heck of an important job that at times can feel overwhelming.  Still he tackles it full bore.  USMC Commendant Flap Le Beau was another guy to get behind.  Not a uniformed butt kisser, but a leatherneck through and through who's not afraid to do grunt work.  My one complaint is there was not enough of Grafton's right hand man, Toad Tarkington.  The guy is great for comic relief.<br />Good story with good characters.  Nice intrigue and countermoves.  The climax on the cruise ship and America rocked!	2003-04-27

So many details, so much time trying to cover one's tracks.  If THE DOGS OF WAR showed us how to put together a mercenary operation, RISING PHOENIX teaches us what it takes to pull off an operation like this.  Ex-DEA agent John Hobart is a very formidible foe.  He may be a stone cold sociopath, but he has a very low key approach about him.  He's also very smart and very meticulous (I hate stupid bad guys in situations like this).  FBI Agent Mark Beamon was a pretty decent character.  Middle-age, not an impressive physical specimen and someone who bucks the system on a regular basis.  I felt the one reviewer made a good observation comparing Beamon to NYPD BLUE's Dennis Franz.  However, I thought there was quite a bit of untapped potential in Beamon.  Though my biggest complaint is how Mills pretty much glossed over the death of Beamon's nephew from tainted cocaine.  It just suddenly appeared in the middle of the book and not much is made after that.  Something like this would have really given Beamon a lot more motivation and emotional turmoil.  <br />I will say the book offered a great moral dilemma that kept you thinking.  While the poisoning sends drug use plummeting in the U.S., the body count rises to staggering levels.  The story has you constantly wondering if the ends justify the means.	2003-03-30

Even though stories about what would have happened if the bomb did kill Hitler are nothing new, the story was handled in a way that made it hard to lose interest.  The initial confusion and the conspirators' ineptitude came off very believable.  I loved the way they handled Rommel's character.  An honorale warrior in a country led by sadists.  The conflict between him and Fuhrer Himmler was good, especially toward the end when the welfare of the Wehrmacht began to take precedence over Berlin's orders.  Patton was Patton.  I really liked the situation involving the production of the Me-262 jet fighters, from all the problems they had to the havoc they wreaked on the Allied air forces.  Some quality combat scenes, especially when Combat Command A got plastered in a German counter-attack.  That really affected its CO, Colonel Pulaski, for the rest of the book.  The end leaves open a rhelm of very unique possibilities.  I definitely will read the sequel.	2003-03-13

Huston does a terrific job handling the fallout from \\"The Balance of Power.\\"  While the first chapter with the kidnapping of an American corporate exec and his wife is written in a rather choppy style, it improves by leaps and bounds after that.  The scenes involving Admiral Billings' court-martial are flat out excellent.  Huston presents great arguments on both sides.  One moment you think Billings will come out OK, the next it appears he has no chance to win.  I do wish the impeachment trial of the President was done better.  Those scenes were just not as compelling as the Billings court-martial.  Again Congressional aide Jim Dillon is a first rate hero.  At times he seems over his head, but that first class mind of his is always working to get out of what appear to be no-win situations.  The return of the terrorist who calls himself George Washington is a great monkey in the wrench.  He's more ruthless in this book than in \\"Balance.\\"  Even with the two problem areas I mentioned, the book overall is a winner.	2003-02-15

One of my favorites had to be Sergeant-Chef Stanislaus Dombrowski of the French Foreign Legion.  He provided a great insight into the kind of brotherhood formed among troops in elite units.  I also really liked Russian commando Colonel Demetre Orlov.  He's what I would call subtly ruthless and loyal to the State, until he's ordered to go after the General in charge of the Perimeter missiles about to go off due to an asteroid strike in Siberia.  Toward the end of the book Orlov is seriously confused as to what his course of action should be.<br />Coyle did an excellent job fleshing out all his characters.  Some of his descriptions of the devastation caused by the asteroid and the harsh conditions the NATO special ops units must face were pretty good.  Not too many combat scenes, but Coyle made up for it at the end with a rollercoaster ride of a battle at the last Perimeter silo.  The epilogue where one SAS officer gives his view on duty to one's country perfectly summed up the theme of this book.<br />Coyle has proven that he has grown as a writer.  Quite frankly, I think some of his characters in &quot;Dead Hand&quot; were better than Colonel Scott Dixon and company in previous novels.  Bully for Mr. Coyle and &quot;Dead Hand.&quot;	2003-01-25

The situation just keeps getting worse and worse for the U.S. as the Chinese restrict traffic into the Panama Canal and blow up merchent ships with manned torpedoes.  The interest level really peaked as Commander Bailey's Intel unit and the destroyer USS Jouett make a harrowing escape out of the Canal.  Good character development.  Bailey is one heck of a smart lady.  Lt. Cmdr. Collins makes for a great protagonist with her itchy trigger finger personality.  The head-butting between her and Jouett's CO, Captain Renninger, after they accidentally shoot down the Panamanian President's plane was handled well.  Really liked Green Beret Billy Elwell.  Always helpful to Bailey, seems like a nice, regular guy, but knows how to make his way through all the shady places in Panama.  One of the best characters had to be torpedo pilot T'sing Lin.  I loved how little by little his fears over his impending suicide mission wear him down mentally.  The more he tries to put on a brave front, the more he drowns in his fear of dying.	2002-12-29

OK, everyone knows what Captain Kirk is like, but she really delved deep into his personality, showing what drives him and how he percieves himself in the the world of Starfleet.  Klingon General Kellen and Vergo Zennor of the Furies were flat out awesome.  Kellen is the most rational, even-keel Klingon you'll ever meet, until the Furies appear in our part of the Galaxy, then he goes into full-blown Klingon mode of \\"Shoot!  Kill!  Destroy!\\"  Zennor seemed in a tenuous situation through the entire book.  While the Furies dogma says with absolute certainty this is the part of the Galaxy where they were banished from, Zennor keeps demanding more proof before deciding if they should go to war with the Klingons and the UFP.  All the while Kirk is doing what he can to negotiate a solution, but Kellen and his fleet are ready to blast the Furies to hell.  I also loved the way Kellen perceived Kirk.  At the beginning of the book, he has a lot of respect for the man, even though he is an enemy.  But the more he talks to the Furies, that respect goes out the window.  I dug his one observation, \\"This Kirk was no Kirk.\\"  The story was excellent with many, \\"Oh ****\\" moments and some really cool battle scenes.  I look forward to reading the rest of the \\"Invasion\\" series.	2002-11-23

Mark Strang was a pretty decent character, but I felt there was a lot of untapped potential that Barnes did not bring to the surface.  He did do a good job with the scenes where Strang questioned his lust for killing anything associated with the enemy Closers.  I also did not get a sense of any great crisis as Strang fights to keep this alternate 1775 on its intended track.  The changes to this timeline were pretty cool.  I am a sucker for time travel/alternate Earth stories.  I liked the introduction of steam engines and dirigibles to 1775.  And George Washington, Duke of Kentucky?  Neat twist.  The action scenes were OK, but tended to get a little too wordy at times.	2002-10-27

This time Dirk Pitt's nemesis is Curtis Merlin Zale, a sociopathic businessman trying to create a monopoly on domestic oil.  With his murderous team of mercs known as the Vipers on his side, he will kill hundreds of thousands to achieve his goal.<br />The adventure scenes were typical Cussler.  The rescue attempts on the burning passenger ship and the luxury submarine kept me rivetted and the aerial battle between Pitt's Trimotor transport plane and a Fokker Triplane over Manhattan was downright awesome!  Liked the angle involving the true story of Jules Verne's Nautalis, but thought the Viking angle could have been done better.  Also some of the dialogue was too formal for actual conversations.  The villains were OK.  After six books, I have yet to see any of Cussler's bad guys match the two evildoers from \\"Sahara\\" in the category of \\"Villains you love to hate.\\"	2002-10-02

Garrison blended some cool action scenes with memorable characters.  Thumbs up on how well he fleshed them out.  Mayor Rudy Mincarelli is a strong willed guy who wants to handle the crisis on his own.  However, I really questioned the man's steadfast refusal to keep the military out of New York.  Who the heck else is equipped to deal with an army of commandoes backed up by missiles and deck guns?  Reporter Jose Chin was annoying but cool.  Cared nothing about his own well-being.  Just wanted to get the big story.  The mayor's press person, Renata, may be an unlikeable, workaholic witch, but she definitely added to the story.  Tugboat Captain Ken Hughes was the blue collar, regular guy hero of the book looking for any opportunity to hurt the Chinese invaders.  His girlfriend, publisher Kate Ross, was an independent, tough woman who runs through a harrowing gauntlet of Chinese marines, Hell's Angels and street gangs all through lower Manhattan.  Even the main bad guy, Admiral Tang, was interesting.  Sort of a Rommel-esque warrior.  Totally loyal to his men, wants the best for his country and believes this outrageous act will make him Emperor of China.<br />Some very cool combat scenes, especially involving the crippled carrier Kennedy, whose crew continues to battle the Chinese despite the damage to their ship.  Lots of boat collisions and some wicked battles in the streets of New York.<br />I do have to take some issue with one reviewer who said the book was an insult to the firefighters and police who died on 9/11.  Actually, the police in this book kept on fighting the Chinese despite horrendous loses and a disadvantage in firepower.  They come off as heroes in my book.  Also, this book was written prior to 9/11.	2002-09-26

I've had this on my to read list for quite some time and now must ask myself &quot;why did I wait so long?&quot;  Forstchen did an excellent job making these characters flesh and blood people you come to care about.  Many of them are either beaten down by 8 years of fighting Rebs and the Horde, or have actually come to love war.  While Col. Keane seems a clone of real-life Maine Col. Joshua Chamberlain of Gettysburg fame, I did like the self-doubt that kept cropping up in him throughout the war.  It made him more of a real person instead of some super leader-type.  Still he goes out and does his job, even though he has to do some very unpleasant things that will eat at his soul forever.  You also really felt the sense of desperation of the humans as the Horde keeps winning one battle after another, threatening the civiliaztion they worked so hard to build.  Very good battle scenes, especially the dogfight between the human and Horde airships.  I definitely want to read more of &quot;The Lost Regiment&quot; series.	2002-08-23

The premise sounded good and I liked the potential conflict with the Soviets over the strange asteroid that settled in Earth orbit.  But the tour through the Stone and the explanations of its features seemed very matter-of-fact and failed to hook me.  Some of the characters were a bit stiff.  I would have liked to have seen more inner reaction about all the Stone's wonders from the main character, Patricia.	2002-07-25

First off, even though Cmdr. Brad Mackenzie is headlined as the hero of this book, I felt the story would have been stronger without him.  Practically every piece of Mac's dialogue sounded like a classroom lecture at Annapolis.  During the obligatory final submarine battle, he was totally useless.  In addition, the USS Bowfin's captain kept talking like a hero from a 1930s weekly movie serial.  <br />Still, there were some characters I found interesting.  Russian Spetsnaz commando Mikhail Borisov and Scots commando Colin Stewart were true warriors.  Confident, dedicated to their people, and never afraid to take on any mission.  Borisov actually came off as a likable guy, considering he was on the wrong side.  <br />While the story had nice plotting, the ending just didn't live up to my expectations.	2002-07-11

This is not like most alternate history stories where it's just one thing that's changed and the rest of the campaign turns out different.  Even with the American retreat at Omaha Beach, the Allies continue to push and fight and die for every inch of French soil.  Both sides are relentless in their fighting.  Whole units are wiped out.  The Allies and the Germans have to scrape the bottom of the barrel to get bodies into the battle.<br />What made this come alive for me is Tsouras' use of personal accounts and showing major battles through the eyes of a few soldiers.  You can actually feel the desperation of both sides as men, equipment and supplies run low.<br />I would have liked to have seen more made of the personalities of the leaders in this battle.  Tsouras did an OK job showing off Montgomery.  The one man he truly captured was Rommel.<br />This is a must for anyone with an interest in World War II.	2002-06-23

Harry doesn't even get on the Hogwarts Express before trouble comes looking for him, in the form of the Dark Lord Voldemort's right hand man, Sirius Black.  <br />The plot twists blew me away.  I love how the main characters are growing.  Harry, Ron and Hermoine all are developing attitudes.  Then again, whether you're Wizard or Muggle, when you're 13, you have an attitude.  Ron refuses to take any more crud from Malfoy, while Hermione has become a 120% workaholic.  The encounters the three friends have also endangers their friendship, as accusations and arguments begin to fly.  Professor Snape has become just plain nasty.  The introduction of Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, was a good touch.  Looks unassuming, but has a first rate mind and is a hit with the students.  But is there more to him?  Oh yeah, and Rowling puts together another awesome Quidditch match between Gryffindor and Slytherin.  Much more rough and tumble than in the previous two novels.  Finally, the Dementors must be mentioned.  They're in a few scenes, but talk about creepy.  They make the Dark Riders from Lord of the Rings look like puppy dogs.<br />Props out to Rowling and her creative genius!	2002-06-18
US	44891071	RZW9XYJ3MKKWE	0515090360	688936016	The Guardians: Armageddon Run	Books	3	1	1	N	N	"Blow 'em Up, Shoot 'em Up Action"	This is not what you would call a deep book.  The Guardians books exist so you can put your brain on hold and enjoy hard-core military action.  In this installment, the Guardians must travel across post-WWIII America trying to re-establish the U.S. Government and implement the Blueprint for Renewel.  But they must contend with sell outs and an invasion force from the newly established Federated States of Europe.<br />Richard Austin wrote some pretty good action scenes.  The stand-off in Kansas between the Guardians and the FSE was pretty exciting.  Also a very good pursuit over Baltimore between an FSE F-15 fighter and the Guardians C-130 transport.  May not sound like much of a contest, but when you've got a crazy, overly-aggressive surfer-dude pilot like Casey Wilson at the controls, anything can happen.<br />Even though this is a short, action-oriented book, Austin did a decent job fleshing out his characters.  I really liked his presentation of Navy Lt. Cmdr. Sam Sloan, who still feels out of his element despite his Guardian training and a year's worth of gritty combat.  McKay is the typical gruff Marine leader-type.  Though throwing in a romance with Sergeant Marla Eklund, whose scratch platoon is accompanying the Guardians, made for some good stuff.  Nice to see him struggle with his emotions over wanting no harm to come to Eklund, yet trying to do his job.	2002-05-22

And I did like how a handful of humans tried to re-establish relations with the marine mammals.  Interesting to see the dolphins butcher the English language, which led to some problems of understanding between the two species.  But then the story ground to a halt.  Everything went swimmingly between man and dolphin and there was hardly any conflict I could see.  The efforts to stop Thread just got breezed over, and the problem Readis' mother had with him communicating with dolphins could have been expanded on a lot more.  To be honest, I did not even get to the end of the book.  I just couldn't see any goals that needed to be achieved or conflicts that needed to be resolved and did not see the need to continue on to the end.	2002-05-10

To me, Dale Brown's \\"Leadership Material\\" was the best of the three.  Loved how he intertwined the different personalities of Col. Norman and Major McLanahan.  Norman, an Air Force accountant assigned to a promotion board, feels an outcast in the pilot-dominated world of the Air Force.  Now his prejudices are coming out as he grades candidates for promotion from Major to Lt. Colonel.  One of the the files he comes across is McLanahan's.  On paper, he feels Mac is so woeful he should be thrown out of the USAF.  But on the other side of the world, as the Gulf War winds down, McLanahan shows his skills and bravery as the Old Dog crew must stop an suped-up, stealthy Tu-160 Iranian bomber from sinking a US carrier.<br />\\"Lash-up\\" by Larry Bond was a pretty good story.  Character development was decent.  The interesting part was seeing how a newly formed group must overcome bureaucracy to come up with a space plane to neutralize a Chinese ASAT system destroying the GPS satellite network.<br />Really enjoyed the David Hagberg story \\"Breaking Point\\" where CIA DDO Kirk McGarvey must prevent an all-out war between China and Taiwan.  Nice drama as McGarvey infiltrates Taiwan.  Loved the captain of the Chinese Han-class sub.  Very crafty guy with zero tolerance for mistakes who tries to foil America's plan.	2002-04-20

If you just want some cool escapism, then you'll want to read this book.  Doherty concentrates more on plot than character development, but he has a heck of a plot.  Now that Area 51's true purpose has been made public, nations around the world are scrambling to pick up artifacts from when the alien Airlia colonized the Earth 5,000 years ago.  At the same time, a message comes in from Mars.  The aliens are coming out of suspended animation and returning to Earth.  While most of the world celebrates, Green Beret Mike Turcotte, Presidential Scientific Advisor Lisa Duncan and archeologist Dr. Nabinger rush to uncover the true purpose of the Airlia's return.  Do they come in peace, or as conquerors?<br />I liked how Doherty brought together all kinds of myths regarding UFOs and ancient civilizations.  Some nice plot twists, especially with the super-super secret shadow organization called STAAR.  Really enjoyed some of the action scenes.  Best ones were the U.S./Britist raid on a South African criminal organization hording Airlia artifacts.  Great stuff and neat strategy when the U.S. military takes on the alien &quot;foo fighters.&quot;  No ID4-type air battles here.  The Navy really has to get imaginative dealing with them.  Decent character development.  Turcotte is my kind of hero, ordinary guy in an extraordinary line of work.  Duncan proves she's not all brians.  She will aggressively defend her friends if she thinks they're in big-time danger.	2002-04-07

You wanted to root on one of the big heroes, Maine Governor and Presidential hopeful Jack Longfellow, but there was a taint on him due to his affair with another woman.  I also liked Joint Chiefs Chairman General Sensenbrenner.  He's a guy still not afraid to walk where regular foot soldiers go and has a soft spot for those in poverty, especially children.  He comes off as such a stand-up guy you forget he's trying to help Vice President Shy Garland overthrow President Teddy Jay.  Speaking of the Veep, I don't think he really came off as the power-hungry nut he was.  One really interesting aspect of the story was the fact that while Garland is power hungry, President Jay is still battling depression and sounds like a total wet noodle throughout the book.  You start to wonder who is the better guy to have in the White House.  The ending, however, did leave me scratching my head in certain places.	2002-03-24

To me it seemed the Pernese settlers dealt with it in a business as usual attitude.<br />However, McCaffrey handled the development of Sorka and Sean very well.  They were by far my most favorite characters in this book.  Liked how Sean starts off as a total loner and very, very slowly warms up to Sorka.  Soon finds himself learning to depend on her and starts opening up.  This is especially true once they discover the dragons on Pern.  <br />The dragons were pretty cool, especially when the Pernese start genetically altering them to grow bigger.  And I did like the very first Threadfall, as debris from an Oort Cloud falls across Pern, burning almost everything it touches.  McCaffrey really drew you into the scene and gave you a grand tour of the disaster and its emotional impact on the colony.<br />On a whole, the book seemed to have its up moments and down moments.	2002-02-24

Rowling did not disappoint on her second Harry Potter adventure.  This time Harry and company are faced with students being turned into living statues, a monster running amuck and rumors of the Heir of Slytherin returning to claim what resides in the Chamber of Secrets.<br />I really thought Harry would have a better time in this book, after all the confidence and friends he gained in the first book.  But it turns out Harry's life is even worse Book Two.  His aunt and uncle (who were no gems in the first book) are utterly abomidable here.  Right off the bat Harry is in trouble with the faculty and his fellow students think he has something to do with all the strange happenings.  Harry still has some of the awkwardness of the first book, but when the situation calls for it, he is able to put his fears aside and do what needs to be done.<br />Excellent job with the characters.  The new teacher, Gilderoy Lockhart, is an egomaniacl blowhard who believes too much of his own good press.  Really annoying guy, especially to Harry.  Rowling also presented us with more of the Weasley family, and what life is like for your &quot;typical&quot; wizard family just trying to get by.  Lots of plot twists and no slow parts.

But if you want to put your brain on hold and read some dynamite action, WAR GOD is the book.  Set during the Cold War, the Soviets lose control of an advanced laser satellite (War God), which lands on a small island near Australia.  The race is on between the USSR and the USA/Aussie Alliance to secure the satellite first.<br />The character development may not be spectacular, but Rogers did do a good job putting human faces on the soldiers involved in the battle.  Lt. Irina Yakoleva was the best character in the book.  A GRU officer specializing in the U.S. military, she finds herself on the front lines trying to prove to the men around her she can hold her own.  Not only does she demonstrate a sound tactical mind, Yakoleva is also deadly with a rifle.  Then there's the Australian SAS guy, Cord.  Comes off as a regular guy with extraordinary skills (especially with a sniper rifle) who knows his limitations.  Captain Carter of the Green Berets and Colonel Ulanov of the Spetsnaz are your typical soldier's soldier, but are good characters nonetheless.<br />Some very good combat scenes with ambushes, armored attacks and one awesome dogfight between U.S. B-52s and Russian TU-95 Bear bombers.

Prehistoric beasts running loose in the present day.  Well done story by Jeff Rovin.  The saber-tooth cats were totally bad.  They made the velociraptors from &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; look like cute, fluffy bunnies.  The storyline proceeded well.  Not a lot of down time or unnecessary scenes.  Nice job on the main characters.  Grand is smart and tough, but is still dealing with the death of his beloved wife.  The presence of saber-tooths in Santa Barbara infuses him with a renewed sense of purpose.  I did find it irritating that at some points he seemed to put more of a value on the animals than the people they were killing, even when the body count really started to climb. That put him in conflict with Sheriff Malcolm Gearhart.  While in Grand's eyes, Gearhart is a grandstanding bully, once you get into the Sheriff's POV, you understand where he's coming from considering his experiences in Vietnam and LAPD.  Then there's reporter Hannah Hughes, who teams up with Grand to get to the bottom of the saber-tooth story.  A relentless and headstrong woman who adds a lot to the book.  Some very good action scenes when the saber-tooths make their attacks, especially at the climax in downtown LA.	2001-12-22

Taylor.  &quot;The Sunset Patriots&quot; just dragged and the characters were merely names on papaer, not flesh and blood people you come to care about.  In most of the scenes, Taylor just told you what was happening, instead of letting the characters describe it to you.  What dialogue Taylor did have was very uninspiring.

It starts off very well as Kirk and co. must stop a runaway starship.  And ending was also very exciting.  But the middle of the book could have been better.  Some parts were a little bit slow.  Also there was no drama when Dr. McCoy comes down with a terminal disease.  Please, you know he's not gonna die.  I did like getting into the minds of the supporting characters like Uhura, Sulu and Chekov.  Also some good scenes where Kirk's faith in Starfleet is really tested the more he uncovers about this illegal experiment.  I just wish the author could have included more alien characters in the story.  Like in Star Trek, all the crew members, all the starship captains and all the scientists are human.  The Federation has over 600 planets.  A little species variety, please.	2001-12-02

Still, Turtledove puts forth a very enjoyable story.  You really get involved with many of the characters and the situations they find themselves in.  Really liked the tension between the two fleetlords, Atvar (Conquest) and Reffet (Colonization).  Neither one can, or is unwilling to, see where the other is coming from.  But you tend to sympathize more with Atvar since he's been on Earth for so long and saw the Race through its most difficult war in history.  The tension between the two filters down to the rank-and-file soldiers and colonists.  Also was nice to see how the Race begins to make Earth its new home.  They even start to befriend humans.  Other enjoyable parts involved Straha, the exiled shiplord, and the tremendous loneliness he feels.  He will never be fully accepted by humans and cannot go back to the Race.  And, of course, the Race fails to fully understand the human psyche.  Taxes on religion and setting up sexual renezvouses are just some of the things they try, which do not go 100% right.

While that is being investigated, a huge oil and gold strike is made in Siberia.  That has China licking its lips.  Now, former adversaries the U.S. and Russia must join forces to prevent Chinese domination of Siberia.<br />Excellent work on the characters, who are almost old friends to hard-core Clancy readers by now.  Loved the portrayal of Jack Ryan in the presidency.  For the most powerful man in the world, he seems to have little independence.  Ryan is a slave to public perception, scheduling, security.  Many of the things he deals with on a day-to-day basis bore him.  Ryan is the ultimate hands-on guy working a job that lets him be anything but.  He really hates this job, but is too dedicated to duty to up and quit.  <br />As far as plot goes, Clancy keeps your interest throughout.  After an unfortunate incident in China with a couple religious folks, it's hard to put this book down.  Good presentation of the Chinese leadership.  These men had a very narrow view of the world and how things are supposed to work.  That just exacerbates the brewing international crisis.  Clancy caps it off with a very exciting ending.  One thing I would have liked to have seen more of is stuff going wrong at critical points of the conflict, which has been a Clancy trademark since &quot;The Hunt For Red October.&quot;	2001-10-31

The Chinese have learned that Einstein solved the Unified Field Theory 50 years ago, but hid the data after the A-bombs were dropped on Japan.  Now it's a race between the Red Chinese and the U.S. to secure the UFT data.  The winner will wind up with a weapon of unimaginable power.  Lots of problems for anti-terrorist expert John Taft to deal with that made you want to read on.  Dragged a bit as you neared the end, but picked back up for an outrageous climax.  No characters really stood out, however.  A few times I had to re-read some of the stuff involving the UFT, but for the most part Dirgo broke it down well for the laymen like me.	2001-09-24

Unfortunately, Mr. Lumley did not execute to my liking. I found the little bit of the book I read plodding, over descriptive and filled with stiff characters and dialogue.	2001-08-26

Fast-paced story with some interesting characters. New Mexico State Police Deputy Chief Kevin Kearney comes off as the every man faced with impossible odds. Still he tackles them with pit bull-like tenacity. In this book, he's trying to handle two cases at once. The shooting of a small town cop who turns out to be not a very nice person, and the theft of millions of dollars worth of art from the Governor's office. Behind the theft is a man named DeLeon, a subtlely evil drug lord with connections all over the place and an obsession to kill Kearny. Lots of interesting characters throughout the story. Robert, the schizophranic man who may be a key witness in the cop shooting case, and Kearney's gay, dandy art enthusiast friend Fletcher Hartley. Really enjoyed the rapport with those two and Hartley's enthusiasm over helping out with the art theft case. At times I wondered if the two separate cases would ever come together, but trust me, they do. Big time. Also, McGarrity did a fantastic job capturing the social atmosphere of the Southwest. As someone who lives a state away in Arizona, I could relate to the resentment between old timers and newcomers and the battle between Western tradition and the building of tourist traps. Fine novel. I am sold on Michael McGarrity.	2001-08-26
US	44891071	R8UDZLI1TYX2B	006105111X	895888953	The Alien Years	Books	4	1	3	N	N	&quot;A Very Human View Of An Alien Invasion&quot;	Robert Silverberg does a first rate job showing all human strengths and weaknesses during a 50-year alien occupation of Earth.  The Entities just fall out of the sky one day and take over without any explanation.  The book focuses primarily on one family who strives to keep the idea of resistance alive while much of the world gives up and accepts alien rule.<br />The resistance fighters are not made out to be larger than life.  They run the gamit of emotions as Silverberg delves into their doubts, their fears, the pressure of living up to their family patriarch, Colonel Carmichael.  The family seems to have a shaky resolve in resisting the aliens, who seem almost god-like in their power.  At times the Carmichaels seem ready to just give it up.  But some spark festers in them, a desire to show that the Entities can be hurt, can be beaten.  Really liked the portrayal of the Conquest world, as infrastructure begins to fall, governments collapse and humans take advantage of the situation.  The best example is Karl Heinrich Borgmann.  Great presentation of how a teenage outcast would act as the Entities' puppet emporer of Earth.  <br />The ending was not typical of an alien invasion story, but the way Silverberg wrote it, it worked out well.	2001-08-15

Larson did an excellent job capturing the period, the atmosphere of turn of the century America and the way people thought.  Pride and ego seemed to be the big downfalls in the lack of warning for Galveston.  Even with Main character Isaac Cline, who considered himself the best of the best among weathermen.  The description of the destruction of Galveston and what the people went through was gripping.  Very vivid.  The hurricane didn't hit all at once.  The problems gradually built up, starting with a little flooding that no one worried about to the full fury of the storm that took an estimated 6,000 lives.  Did enjoy some of the parts about the history of hurricane study and how forecasters really didn't know a lot about the storms, but thought they knew everything.  Some of the scientific descriptions went over my head.  Still, very enjoyable book.	2001-07-28

It's the near future and China pretty much rules the world.  The only obstacle to its power hungry goals is the United States.  For the first time since 1812, Americans battle a foreign enemy on their own soil.<br />Harry really draws you into the war with a stellar cast.  Stephie Roberts, daughter of the President of the United States, is an 18-year-old private on the front lines.  Starts off nervous, afraid, unsure.  But battle after battle help transform her into a hardened person, willing to die before letting the Chinese dominate her country.  President Bill Baker tries to hold everything together through sheer force of will as he deals with the Chinese invaders and members of his own government and military plotting to overthrow him for, in their belief, stronger leadership.  Very interesting character in Chinese Lt. Wu, son of the U.S. Administrator who seeks to prove himself in combat, but is not allowed.  Grows more and more distant and rebellious as a result.  Really liked Green Beret Captain Hart,  fighting in enemy-occupied Alabama.  Pulls off some very cool attacks.  Comes off as a seemingly ordinary guy, but with a subtle lethal streak to him.<br />Harry puts together excellent combat scenes that make you feel part of the action.  The desparation is evident as Chinese forces role through Alabama, Georgia, the Carolinas and California.  Probably my one complaint is that I would have liked to have seen some more partisan action behind the lines as American civilians take up arms to fight the Chinese any way they can.  But all in all, a very well done book.	2001-07-17
US	44891071	R3JD0QEJDB6ZK4	0425169367	420963473	Atlantis 1	Books	4	1	2	N	N	&quot;Very cool military/paranormal adventure&quot;	Donegan did a great job tying together some of Earth's biggest mysteries into a cool sci-fi story.  History buff that I am, I really liked how he worked Flight 19 and the USS Scorpion disappearance into the book.  Pretty good action scenes.  Did a great job handling the survey crew on the downed plane in Cambodia.  Ariana Michelet came off as a take charge woman focused on getting her crew out alive despite the strange goings on around them.  Former Green Beret Dane seemed pretty stone cold, but given what he'd been through with his earlier journey into the mysterious Angkor Kol Ker section of Cambodia, it was understandable and worked well in the story.  And what a secret this guy has!  Also, the Shadow was a unique race of alien invaders.  Very imaginative.	2001-07-02
US	44891071	R20INVUO68QDU9	0671519816	129533604	Inca Gold (Dirk Pitt Adventure)	Books	3	0	0	N	N	&quot;Good, But Needed More Adventure&quot;	An international relic smuggling syndicate is the target for Dirk Pitt &amp; Co. in this offering from Clive Cussler.  Starts out very well with an incredible rescue and escape from a sacrifical pool in Peru.  As soon as that's wrapped up, Pitt, old buddy Al Giordino and a group of researchers must fight for their lives against sadistic mercenary Tupac Amaru.  Great fight scene.  Unfortunately, the middle of the book tends to slow down.  Not as much adventure that I've come to expect from Cussler.  The battle on the ferry made up for it.  So did the end in the underground river.  That was classic Pitt in the impossible situation.  The villians were OK, but nowhere near the classic bad guys from &quot;Sahara.&quot;	2001-06-14

Stories of undersea civilizations are nothing new, but I thought Cook did an OK job handling this one.  Really liked how he presented Interterra, its culture, its technology, its beliefs when it comes to reproduction (which are pretty wild).  Bascially, this civilization, which is millions upon millions of years old, has created a virtual utopia.  But the more time the explorers spend in Interterra, they wonder if utopia is really worth living in, especially when it's not clear whether they will be allowed to return to the surface world.  No real clear distinction is made on who is absolutely right or wrong about the fate of the explorers.  Still, I thought Cook handled the story well.	2001-04-21
US	44891071	R2A62O6OA5OMLN	0943039029	811834197	Sacrifice: The True Story of Courage over Chernobyl	Books	4	5	5	N	N	&quot;An Incredible Story of Courage&quot;	Well done story that does justice to the men who gave their lives to fight the worst nuclear disaster ever.  The book details the exploits of two helicopter test pilots, Anatoly Grishenko and Gourgen Karapetyan.  It starts out slow, showing their lives in the Soviet Union just a couple months before the Chernobyl disaster.  They are not supermen or people looking to be heroes.  They come off as average guys who happen to have one heck of an extraordinary job.  Both are called into service to help seal the exposed reactor.  Unfortunately, Anatoly develops cancer because of it.  I was totally amazed at the level of dedication Gourgen had to get the help his friend needed, any way he could.  Quite frankly, he took a lot of big risks doing it, since Glasnost and Perastroika were just beginning in the Soviet Union.  Gourgen truly defines the meaning of the word friend by his deeds to save Anatoly.  Also, can't forget the dedication of the people in the U.S. who worked to bring Anatoly to the States to get him the treatment he needs (including the book's author).<br />Parlier went into great detail, giving a blow-by-blow description of the Chernobyl disaster.  Totally gripping!  Really gave you a sense of just how catastrophic this accident was.  Better than anything else I've scene or read.  Also left me with an angry feeling toward the plant manager who refused to believe the worst was happening despite people literally keeling over in front of him from radiation sickness.<br />This is definately a story that needed to be told.  Anatoly and Gourgen didn't complain or question the orders to send them over Chernobyl.  They simply felt they had a job to do and they were the only ones who could do it.  Good men, both of them!	2001-03-09

Three history students are sent back to the Middle Ages by a genius billionaire to save their stranded professor.  As soon as they land, they're in trouble.  Every 5 pages a new danger awaits.  Jousting tournaments, swordfights, puruits by knights, even a medeival seige.  The drama and adventure do not let up.<br />Pretty good characters.  None overly heroic, though Andre comes the closest, since he is very into the Middle Ages, to the point of learning how to swordfight.  Kate isn't afraid to take risks and can take care of himself.  Chris was the most interesting.  Sort of the Gilligan of the group, always getting into trouble.  Loved his development throughout the story.<br />Crichton did an excellent job depicting the Middle Ages as acurately as you can get.  No proper, Shakesperean English or gallant, honorable knights.  Kept it real, gritty and even showed how the English language then was nothing like it is today.  Also liked his explanation for how they travel to the past.  A non-techie like me was able to grasp most of it.<br />Well researched and well plotted.  Another winner from Mr. Crichton.	2001-03-09
