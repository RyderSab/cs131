While at the beach with her best friend, Gina, Suze just happens to see four teenagers dressed up for the prom trying to steal a twelve-pack of beer. Now the guy at the counter isn't an Einstein, but he's bound to notice them trying to steal it, but he doesn't and that's when Suze get a good look at them, and realizes that they're ghosts. And Suze, being the lucky person that she is, just happens to be a mediator, someone who can see dead people. It turns out the four were killed in a car accident and are out for blood. The person they blame for their deaths is Michael Meducci, who isn't the most popular guy in school. In order to protect Michael from the four teenagers, who have been dubbed the RLS Angels, she's going to have to date him. This isn't exactly making her like being a mediator. But Suze, Father Dominic, and Jesse find out that the RLS Angels might not be wrong about Michael. And if their suspicions are true a member of Suze's family might be the next ghost she sees.

Susannah Simon is the focus of this new series about a girl who has been seeing (and sometimes fighting) ghost since she was younger than Cole Sear (kid from The Sixth Sense) is now. And if some unfortunate ghost makes the mistake of getting Susannah mad, she can actually hit them. In Shadowland we meet Susannah, as she is moving in with her new stepfather and stepbrothers. She really wants to make this work for her mom but when she sees a ghost in her new room she can't help but look a little startled. And her mom practically breaks into tears. The ghost, Jesse, is actually pretty cool so she decides to just figure out how to help him move on later. But the next day at school she is introduced to Heather, a very violent ghost who killed herself when her boyfriend dumped her. She ends up having to hit the Heather, which isn't exactly the way Father Dom, another mediator, thinks it should be handled. But Heather isn't making it easy, she insists Sue is trying to take her place and almost kills Sue in a fit of rage. And after she puts Father Dom in the hospital, Sue decides there is only one way to stop Heather: an exorcism. But what if Heather is too powerful to be lured into such a trap? This book was great; the only problem is that they don't come out with more books faster. I also feel kind of left out, it's like everyone can see ghost but me. Just as well, I guess, I'd probably freak out if I did see one.	2001-02-25

Cooper has been having nightmares about the kidnapping of a young girl. At first she thinks it is just a dream, but then it happens while she's wide awake and she knows who the girl is. The girl is Elizabeth Sanger and she wants Cooper to help find her. The police have a suspect but Elizabeth says it's someone else. The only problem is Elizabeth's anger at the person was so powerful that it overwhelmed cooper before she could identify him or her. So now Cooper is pulling a Nancy Drew and is almost killed when she, along with Kate and Annie, get to close. But once Cooper gets an idea about what's going on, Annie turns up missing and the only way to get her back safely is for Cooper to communicate with Elizabeth again. But Cooper's afraid that she will be overwhelmed again. Will she be able to overcome her fears in time to save Annie? This is my favorite book in the series so far; it gives you enough clues to let you figure out who did it before they tell you. I wish the fourth book were out already.	2001-02-25

And when she goes to confront him about it she passes out cold and it turns out she's got a fever that would kill a normal person. But Amy's not normal, at least she didn't used to be. I thought this book was great, we got to learn about another scientist from Project Crescent and found out that Amy's not completely perfect.	2001-02-19

So the Animorphs have decided that, in order to stand a chance against them, they have to tell the world about the Yeerks. So they send Marco, Tobias, and Ax to try and convince the governor of the truth. But, as usual, what was supposed to be a low profile mission ends up as your not-so-average highway chase scene. Animorphs just keeps getting better as we draw closer and closer to the end. Ax even learned how to do jokes and sarcasm. But the funniest part, IMHO, was when Tobias criticized his duck morph. Lisa Harkrader ghostwrote this one and she did a great job.	2001-02-09

Chase was cloned from a serial killer, and even though everyone keeps telling him that it doesn't matter, Chase isn't so sure. So, after accidently causing the death of a murderer, a guilt ridden Chase decides that he can't risk hurting anyone else. He goes to work in the forest where there are very few people. But back home, Chase's friends are trying to keep a trashy reporter from blaming the death of a girl on Chase. The reporter thinks Chase did it because Chase's DNA doner killed his victims in the same way the girl died, and since he's in jail, the reporter decides to try and pin it on Chase. It's up to Chase's friends to protect him and since Chase has managed to get into more trouble they have to rescue him, too. The Killer was a great book and I hope not the last one in the series. But if it is it's a great way to end a great series.	2001-01-28

She lives in Canada, in the year 1987, at least that's what she's been led to believe. Angel hated Michael Vallant for nine years before she met him. She always had to move every couple of years, but no matter where she went Michael Vallant was there before. So when Angel moved to a town where no one had heard of him, she was thrilled. Until he moved there while she was still there. Angel and Mike immediately start a war with each other, until their common goal brings them together. Escape, ever since they were little Angel and Mike have both wanted out. So when they finally start working together they finally figure out what's been going on. It turns out that the year is actually 2098, and that they are a subspecies of humans. And when a doctor who wants to sell Angel and Mike to the highest bidder decides they aren't worth the trouble, they have to play his games in order to save another of their kind from death. I really liked this book and can't wait for the sequel, Silver Eyes. We really should have known more about Angel sooner since it was from her POV, but not knowing made the book more interesting. The author has a website at [...] if you're interested.	2001-01-28

But how can they when the only thing keeping them alive is the temperamental Roman god of the sea, Neptune. Neptune has them in his own little underwater world and the only way for them to stay alive there is for them to make Neptune happy. David doesn't know what to do and to add to his problems Merlin is there looking for Senna. The only thing David knows is that he can't let Merlin get Senna. Also back in the real world he meets that strange lady who told him to &quot;close the gateway&quot; and finds out who she really is. We get to understand David a lot better and see how he is willing to do anything to save Senna and be a hero. Understand the Unknown was a gook book but definitely not the best in the series. At the end we get another cliffhanger and are left to wonder what happens.	2001-01-27

Jake is refusing to take responsibility and be the leader they need, and the 'rents aren't helping with their refusal to cope with reality. Rachel is constantly blowing up at her mom for not facing the truth, that this isn't some law case and that they are in a real war, while Cassie's parents can't seem to realize that the Hork-Bajir aren't just a bunch of animals in need of help. They have no way of getting information about the Yeerks and if they are attacked now, the Yeerks probably won't have a problem taking them down. So they figure there's only one way they can stand a chance against the Yeerks, the morphing cube. They need more people on their side, but everyone remembers what happened the last time they gave someone the morphing power. And if they do choose to do it how will they figure out who's a controller and who's not. Kimberly Morris, the ghostwriter who helped with this book, did a really great job. Cassie's usually not my favorite character, but I actually liked her in this book. This book that shows how much Cassie has changed due to the war. It has earned its place next to #49 on my bookshelf.	2001-01-27

She tries to get herself hooked, but every time she watches it, the show ends up giving her a headache. Headaches wouldn't be a problem for anyone else but Amy isn't like everyone else. Amy is one of twelve girls who were genetically made to be perfect. Her mother thinks this is the reason she doesn't like the show, because she is more mature than the other students. But lately everyone has been acting weird, more responsible, and frankly, it's giving Amy the creeps. No one has been getting into trouble or fighting at school. Even Amy's best friend and boyfriend are acting weird. Amy's already has her mind made up, she is going to find out what's going on before it's too late to save her friends. This book was interesting and showed how much Amy really wants to fit in and be normal. It definitely wasn't the best in the series but it was still a good book.	2000-12-30

It seems the Yeerks are catching on to the Animorphs. They no longer think the Animorphs are Andalites. The Sharing is sponsoring a blood drive and Controllers have recently robbed the garden of animal DNA. Not just any animal DNA but the DNA of tigers, wolves, elephants, and were very upset when they couldn't find any DNA from a red-tailed hawk. When the Animorphs try to mess up their plan they actually make things worse. But in the process Tobias finds someone he hasn't seen in a very long time. The only problem is that the Yeerks found her, too. This was one of the bests Animorphs books since K.A. started using ghostwriters, and it was longer than previous the previous books. I found myself turning each page with the old excitement I used to have when reading Animorphs. So all you Animorphs veterans should come out of retirement before it's too late and read this one. Trust me, it's worth it.	2000-12-22
