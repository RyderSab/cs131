For instance when linking - it really is a point and shoot system. I guess once you get the hang of it as the way the book describes the step by step procedure - you'll find similar attributes in MSVisio. This book may seem simple but necessary in its step by step procedure. Each chapter enumerates on each part of the creation of a professional html web page. I recommend this book if you want to learn how to use GoLive the right way, which will in-turn advance you to be more creative with your ideas.	2004-07-20

CD-ROM and InfoTrac)	Books	3	9	10	N	N	The Long Way Book	I was very disappointed in this book because I looked forward to my finance class in college. But this book was poorly put together - one short paragraph would talk about carry forward and back but nothing was elaborated on the subject - it would just go right into the equation. I heavily depended on the professor's lecture and not once referred to the book when studying for the exam. However, I did use the book to make sure I was using the correct terminology for the exam.	2004-03-22

In fact, they recommend that you purchase a study guide to go along with this book (what does that tell you!!!). Along with a poor accounting lecture you are doomed to barely pass an accounting class with this book. The write up and description of general concepts ? extends to some far out, drawn out, and exacerbated lecture that may have been written by satanic worshipers or something like that. I bought the study guide to go along with this book after I did so poorly on my first exam and now I know why a few did well on their exam?s ? because they bought the study guide!!! The study guide should be used as the main study concept and leave this heavy weighted book on the shelf?	2004-03-22

However, if you are a student using this book and you have to buy it used - MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE CD that should come with this book. You can download the assignments from the website BUT YOU NEED THE CD FOR VB 6.0 &gt; I bought this book used and it did not come with CD so I used VB 5.0 and there are some slight differences and the assignments on tutorial 4-9 cannot open some of the projects using VB 5.0 &gt; SO YOU MUST HAVE VB 6.0	2003-10-19
