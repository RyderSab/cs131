US	49799073	R2U8A3IULF0U79	0892961511	478527670	The Blunderer	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Lies, guilt, and amazing suspense	Currently out of print, this early thriller by Patricia Highsmith bears many of her trademarks:  page-turning suspense, unbelievably cruel and sordid characters, the &quot;doppelganger&quot; motif (as in &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot;), the famous &quot;transference of guilt&quot; that fascinated Hitchcock, and an overpowering sense of hopelessness (at times I felt like I was reading an American version of Camus's &quot;The Stranger&quot;).  Added here is a theme of lying that twists and turns its way through the plot until &quot;the tangled web&quot; is so thick that there is simply no way out.<br />The story concerns two unhappy marriages -- one that ends in murder, and another that seems headed in the same direction.  Like so many other Highsmith books, it features a pair of not-too-admirable protagonists, one who is truly guilty and another who only seems to be -- or is he really?  How much do intention and motivation count toward making a man guilty of murder?  This is one of Highsmith's favorite themes, and it's played out here in its most radical and shattering incarnation.<br />In the end, I think you'll find the book is about a man who is not so much a blunderer as he is virtually driven to possible madness and genuine guilt by the constant doubt and suspicion of everyone he knows -- including himself.<br />In typical Highsmith fashion, this is a book nearly impossible to put down, yet dizzying in its psychological implications.  I've said before that reading Highsmith is like falling down a well -- it's dark and terrifying, and there's no way to stop.  That's about what this book feels like.  <br />Well worth finding, esp. for the die-hard Highsmith fan (like me).	2001-03-07

It's absolutely fascinating, and essential reading.	2001-03-01

Folks teaching on Esther should also consider Karen Jobes's excellent commentary in the NIV Application series; it's absolutely indispensable.	2001-01-23

Now that my study on Esther is finished, I can't think of another tool I relied on more heavily than this one (except for the Bible, of course!); I sometimes felt that I should just stop teaching and buy every person in my class a copy of Jobes's excellent book.  <br />It's extremely well-informed, marshaling a vast assortment of scholarly material from other writers; yet it's also quite contemporary, with extended passages applying the text to modern-day life.  Best of all, it's level-headed and perceptive; she really wants to understand the book, and thus brings no particular preconceptions about how this or that event should be interpreted.  <br />One thing I learned in my teaching is that Esther is one of the most cryptic books in the Bible, with many thorny issues about which the Biblical writer himself does not care to editorialize.  Jobes brings a refreshingly open-minded approach to these issues, and really makes you think, think, think.  Yet she never veers from her obvious conviction that this is the infallible word of God.  It's quite exhilarating!  I kept reading huge chunks of her analysis aloud in class.  One of these days I'll track her down and write a letter expressing my gratitude.  <br />If you're a fan of Esther, and especially if you plan to teach or preach on the book, YOU NEED Jobes's terrific analysis.  I found it indispensable.	2001-01-23

The Sunday Times said of Highsmith, &quot;She makes books that you really can't put down.&quot;  This is one of them.  After 25 or 30 pages, I defy any crime &amp; suspense fan to stop reading.  <br />All the usual Highsmith elements are here -- smooth, accomplished writing, an absorbing plot, eerily believable characters, and an authentic feeling for locale (in this case, 1970s Manhattan); on the whole, however, the book isn't nearly as successful as many other Highsmith works.  The ending is something of a shock, and leaves one wondering just what she was trying to say and accomplish; the thematic material also -- though never overt in Highsmith -- is especially hard to assemble, and creates a suspicion that, in this book, there wasn't any.  <br />Though it's well worth reading for the page-turning suspense, I wouldn't pay too much for some rare copy -- esp. as there are plenty of other Highsmiths that are very exciting and work quite well on other levels too (&quot;Cry of the Owl,&quot; which is still in print; &quot;This Sweet Sickness,&quot; which isn't; and &quot;Strangers on a Train,&quot; which has been out of print for years but will be re-issued by Norton in August 2001).<br />Not bad, but if you're not a Highsmith fan, trying something else first.	2001-01-20

Please let me beg to differ with them all.  I haven't read &quot;Willows in Winter,&quot; but I loved &quot;Wind in the Willows&quot; and felt Horwood's &quot;Toad Triumphant&quot; was in some ways even better.  &quot;Willows and Beyond&quot; brings the cycle to a conclusion -- and it's wonderful.  <br />At times it made me roar with laughter; at others it's painfully sad; the chapter called &quot;The Uninvited Guest&quot; is simply lovely, and belongs in someone's anthology of writings about Christmas.  <br />Yeah, so the main characters die -- did ya think they'd live forever?  Can't we name several other children's books where important characters pass on -- &quot;Old Yeller,&quot; &quot;Dominic,&quot; &quot;A Day No Pigs Would Die,&quot; &quot;Bambi,&quot; etc.?  Furthermore, the deaths are handled so gently, even ambiguously, that I can't understand how anyone would have been seriously upset.  <br />And yes, there is a chapter on Rat's illness; but that's humorously tossed aside (a bit of underdone potato, as it were), and nicely counterbalanced by dashing adventures on the high seas -- not to mention Toad's famous charge up the hill into Lathbury Wood.  <br />And shall we risk a hint at how the book ends by pointing out that each major character, having passed on, is given a successor -- heir to his name, title and role (to such a degree that further adventures are entirely possible!).<br />Don't be put off by a few readers' negative comments; Horwood's third Willows book is a fine piece of work, and leaves one thirsting for more.	2001-01-18

Yes, it's a fairly suspenseful tale -- in places a real page-turner (though for sheer, unvarnished terror you can't beat &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; or &quot;The Cry of the Owl&quot;); but it's really a book about relationships: about identity, isolation, and forgiveness, one so profound that it could be read and discussed almost endlessly.  <br />Highsmith's ability to make readers care for flawed and even sinful characters is astonishing; there simply is NO ONE who compares to her.  The ending of this book is so deeply compassionate it made me weep -- something I do very rarely with novels of any kind.  <br />Help me, please -- is there anyone out there who feels the way I do about Highsmith, or have I lost my mind?  If I have, I hope I do not find it again until I have read all of her books.<br />Thanks, Atlantic Monthly Press, for making these books available in the United States; how about putting &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; and &quot;This Sweet Sickness&quot; back in print as well?  For anybody who's curious about Highsmith, &quot;Those Who Walk Away&quot; is an excellent place to start.	2000-11-26

A fine meditation on the effect of guilt -- and the guilt that comes from intention rather than action.  Several great plot twists and a heart-stopping climax -- but I found the ending very disturbing, morally (naturally, I can't be too specific; don't want to spoil it).  Like most of Highsmith's work, it's beautifully written, tough to put down, and extremely thought-provoking.  Highsmith collectors beware: this book was also published as a Crime Club selection under the title &quot;The Story-Teller.&quot;	2000-11-07

I'm inclined to agree with the obviously youthful reader who declared, &quot;This is the greatest book ever written!&quot;  It's not, of course -- but it's an awful lot of fun.  <br />Beautifully written, laugh-out-loud funny, sad but not painful, and brilliantly constructed, with as meaty a consideration of fate and free will as you are likely to find in a work of contemporary fiction.  NOTE TO THE HIGHBROW CROWD:  Ya don't have to use long sophisticated arguments to get the heart of a matter like this; if this book doesn't get you thinking about personal responsibility, then you probably aren't used to thinking much.  <br />NOT FOR KIDS UNDER 14, it contains some sexuality and vulgarity but comes down squarely on the conservative side of these issues.  <br />Everything you could ask for in a &quot;young adult&quot; novel; don't miss it.	2000-10-23

There are some truly bizarre stories -- including a sci-fi piece (not typical for her) and a dream-like fantasy called &quot;One for the Islands&quot; -- that simply do not work at all; and &quot;The Pond&quot; is a nasty, depressing tale.  However, &quot;Something You Have to Live With,&quot; &quot;A Curious Suicide,&quot; &quot;Those Awful Dawns&quot; and &quot;Woodrow Wilson's Neck-Tie&quot; are all vintage Highsmith, and make this collection well worth acquiring.  &quot;Something&quot; is a very thought-provoking story, and &quot;Dawns&quot; is simply shocking; unforgettable.  <br />For the record, I've read a lot of Highsmith's short stories -- which poured prolifically from her pen in late career -- and the only uniformly excellent collection is &quot;Eleven,&quot; which features first-rate early tales and is, fortunately, still in print.	2000-10-19

It shouldn't take any sane reader long to figure out that Highsmith's final novel has no intention of being the typical suspense thriller that she is known for.  There's plenty of the old-fashioned &quot;apprehension&quot; here that Graham Greene first identified as the hallmark of her work; but this is a NOVEL in the finest modern sense, replete with convincing characters, complex relationships, and richly textured themes.  As long as I live I'll never forget the character of Ralph Lindermann, and how he turned out to be RIGHT, damn him, in his annoyingly pessimistic reading of events. Among other things, this is a brilliant exploration of urban life in the eighties, and one of Highsmith's most assured and sophisticated works; like so many of her other works, it's painful and deeply moving.	2000-10-19

I'm writing this review not only because I loved this book but also  because I'm not sure many of the other on-line reviewers understood it very  well.  Mrs. Bridge is not meant to be a heroine -- nor does the author  intend to endorse her views and practices.  The reason for these  misunderstandings is simple:  Connell is a brilliant realist who keeps  himself and his own judgments carefully out of the way; he has such a light  touch, such a deadpan approach, and offers so little help in interpreting  the book's events, that he creates one of the most joyously liberating  literary experiences I've had; unfortunately, he also opens himself up to  radical misinterpretation.  For my own part, I'm almost ready to put  Connell among the 20th century's finest writers (I don't go in for the  usual gang -- Fitzgerald, Nabokov, Joyce ad nauseam are all over-rated and  far too cerebral); this is a moving, painful, hilarious, deeply insightful  and sometimes satirical look at a middle-class woman whose well-meaning  workaholic husband has given her everything and thereby slowly destroyed  her life; she's not a thinker or a go-getter, and has only occasional  moments of beginning to understand what has happened to her (or failed to  happen).  Connell pulls this off without condemning her or her lunk-headed  husband; it's a powerfully compassionate performance, and one of the best  books I've read in the past year.  Very highly recommended.  (Its companion  -- &quot;Mr. Bridge&quot; -- is also excellent, as is the overlooked  Merchant-Ivory film of both books called &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge.&quot;)	2000-09-06

It features a  tyrannical father, an independent and resourceful heroine, two black  mambas, lots of gold, and the usual winsome and authentic historical  ambience that has made O'Dell so reliable.

I wonder how long it will take folks  to figure this out (and to start putting many of her long-lost books back  in print) -- esp. since she is cleverly disguised as a suspense/thriller  writer (and she is a darned good one); but she's equally interested in  exploring the complexities of modern life, with its alienation, widespread  atheism, and deliberate cruelty.  &quot;A Game for the Living&quot; is  something of a whodunit, but also a beautifully realized tour of Mexico at  mid-century, plus a flawless character study of two men who are polar  opposites, one of whom commits himself to friendship with the other,  despite the distinct possibility that the other man murdered the girl they  both loved.  It's a deeply moving portrait of friendship, and another great  read from Miss Highsmith's collection.	2000-08-17

WHAT!   This is,quite simply, one of the finest novels I have ever read.  It was as tough to put down as any other book I've encountered, and at times as profound as Shakespeare.  I've yet to discover any other writer besides Highsmith whose books are both absolutely riveting and thoroughly penetrating about the human condition.  At times, it was so suspenseful I thought I was going to have a heart attack.  The only other experience I've had in life that was as ravaging as this book is sex.  Yet despite its at-times horrifying suspense, it is excruciatingly compassionate; the ending made me weep.  Highsmith's characters are unbelievably real; I still can't figure out how she makes us care so much about people who are so flawed and sinful.  It's as close to the divine as a writer can get.  WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE PUT THIS BOOK BACK IN PRINT SO I CAN GIVE A COPY TO EVERYONE I KNOW!   END	2000-06-14

It's a thorough, well-nigh  encyclopedic look at Hitch's work, with a brief chapter (averaging about 4  pages) on each major film.  The chapters include complete cast and credits  --including &quot;uncredited cast&quot; -- plus a synopsis, and sundry  comments on each film under such headings as &quot;cruelty  to<br />animals,&quot; &quot;mysogyny,&quot; &quot;ice maidens,&quot;  &quot;roots,&quot; and a &quot;final word&quot; with a critical appraisal  including a rating on a scale of 1-10.  While examination of each film is  necessarily brief, it's quite thorough and absolutely chock-full of cool  trivia.  Every now and then there are sidebars on stars with whom Hitch  worked; there's also an amazing appendix listing every single episode from  Hitch's TV shows (not just the ones he directed -- but ALL OF EM).  Only  negatives: could use an INDEX, plus I noticed several careless spelling  errors (actors' names and so forth) of the type that tend to make one a bit  suspicious.  On the whole, however, this is THE place to start for the  Hitchcock novice, and a real treasure trove for the seasoned fan like me.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-21

Actually, that's not what the book is about at all.  Cohen is interested  only in the switch from what she calls a &quot;subjective narrative&quot;  -- literary fiction of the Victorian age -- to film narrative of the modern  era.  She claims literary fiction in the 1800s had developed a  female-centered subjectivity and that cinema came along to  &quot;re-orient&quot; the public to a male-focused sensibility.  She  hammers this over and over again throughout her book, and spends way too  much time examining gender roles, until you could swear there was nothing  else that mattered about Hitchcock's films.  Of course, this is always the  problem with any tightly-focused scholarly analysis (&quot;When the only  tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail&quot;); so it's not  terribly objectionable, and fortunately the book does have quite a number  of interesting insights, esp. about Hitch's relationship with his daughter  and the roles he cast her in as those roles reflect the development of  their father-daughter dynamic.  While I disagree with much of what Cohen  says, I found her book a catalyst to some very interesting thinking about  Hitch.  In particular, she has quite a fascinating perspective on his last  films, which are often viewed as failures; she thinks they're just  exericses in post-modernism.  Whatever you think about the book, I continue  to be amazed at how many people feel compelled to ransack Hitchcock's work;  it's as though no serious film fan has any choice but to address what he  did.  This book is another interesting step in the process. . . .	2000-04-18

Tightly constructed, beautifully written,  thematically rich; top-of-the-line in every category.  It's slow going at  first, but grows on you once you see what Jewett is examining -- the  interconnectedness of all people, even those who live far apart and have  seemingly nothing in common.  The bookshelf of any bona fide literature fan  -- esp. fans of American lit. -- should not be without this little  masterpiece.	2000-04-15

It's nicely laid out, with some traditional  pages and other full-page spreads, though I think the actual illustrations  could be more detailed and creative, esp. at this price!  However, it is a  nice intro to a famous and complicated story, and fairly easy to follow.   Parents who may consider this for their children, however, should beware;  the Rhine-maidens are unabashedly naked!  Recommended for Ring fans and  comic junkies.	2000-04-15

Dark and icy Norwegian atmosphere, very strong characters, solid plotting.  From page one, you know you're in the hands of a pro.  It's too bad this little  gem in out of print.

Rather, says Brill, H's films on the whole are hopeful, affirming, generating conventional suspense and  working toward a happily-ever-after ending.  Works like Psycho and Vertigo,  Brill contends, are exceptions to more typical works like North by  Northwest and The 39 Steps, which are quite upbeat and happy.  According to  Brill, Hitch is really an ironist whose occasional subversions of his  generally hopeful outlook have received more critical attention; but that  doesn't mean his whole ouevre is one of despair or pessimism.  Brill argues  magnificently in many well-informed essays; though his citation of Trouble  with Harry as the quintessential Hitchcock film is a bit hard to swallow.   Highly recommended for Hitchcock fans!	2000-04-12

Frankenheimer is a hero of mine.  I just loved &quot;The Train,&quot; &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; and &quot;Seconds.&quot;  (&quot;Ronin&quot; was pretty good, too!) This long-out-of-print book  addresses F's work up through about 1970 or so -- that is, most of the  films that are worthwhile (what happened to his talent in the seventies and  eighties, anyway?)and does a superb job of piling on info about these  little-known masterpieces.  Loaded with cool trivia; did you know that the  big spectacular wreck in &quot;The Train&quot; destroyed several cameras,  and that the air-raid scene consisted of actually blowing up a real rail  yard that the French govt. was planning to raze!   Good luck tracking down  a copy of this -- but it'll be worth the trouble if you love F as much as I  do.  (Let's just hope his next film is better than &quot;Reindeer  Games&quot;!)	2000-04-11

They are not  going to stand up -- like so many other evangelicals -- and lambaste youth  culture for its excesses, bad taste, foul language, etc. (though they don't  look kindly at these things, either); instead, they seek to see WHY such  things appeal to youth, honing in particuarly on our culture's  institutional SEPARATION of youth from adults.  Very provocative and  level-headed.  Highly recommended for Biblical thinkers who want to grapple  with what is going on in the heads of young rockers and video-philes.	2000-04-11

Its sequel, &quot;Stowaway to . . . &quot; is also good.  I spent quite a bit of time dreaming about finding one of the other three Mushroom Planet books in some used bookstore, and  finally happened upon this one, #3 in the series.  It wasn't worth the  trouble, with a somewhat contrived plot of yet another (smaller) object  orbiting the earth -- though it does have some fine drawings in it.  Stick  with Cameron's first two books.	2000-04-03

Part three in the adventures of Richard Hannay (which started with Buchan's well-known &quot;Thirty-nine Steps&quot;), this is a first-rate thriller set on the eve of World War I, with plenty of atmosphere and hair-breadth  escapes, plus an excellent dogfight climax in the skies over France.  Along  with everything else, it has some sound theological reflections (the title  being a character from &quot;Pilgrim's Progress&quot;) about courage and  fortitude.  Highly recommended.	2000-04-03

To the massive wealth of writings on Hitchcock and his most influential film, add this slender but invaluable piece by the movie's star, Janet Leigh.  By now everyone knows that Leigh hasn't taken a shower since she  met Norman's mother &quot;out on the old highway,&quot; but this book is  filled with many other tidbits -- like Hitch refusing to use expensive  costumes for his star, but instead insisting on cheap outfits from a  discount store (to match the character's profile!); and the fact that in  the famous roadside scene with the highway cop, Leigh was never on  location; her scenes were filmed in the studio and blended seamlessly with  location footage involving the cop.  For Psycho fans, this book is a MUST.	2000-04-03

This is a finely realized piece about two men who've been living alone for years,  mapping the terrain in the American West, and the changes that occur in  their relationship when various outsiders -- including a woman who has come  to make an independent film -- come into their &quot;terrain.&quot;  Richly  layered with unobtrusive symbols and interrelationships, also well-informed  about its subject matter.

(Marion flushes her calculations down the toilet; Cassidy says,  &quot;She sat there while I dumped it out&quot;!)  The introductory essay  is also very insightful, esp. about Hitch's oversight of his own films.  (Sterritt claims that H's cameos are signs that he is ever-present and  always monitoring his creation.)  I love Hitch, I have practically every  book written about him and his work, and I can recommend this book  unreservedly.	2000-03-31

Too bad so few know of this obscure full-length novel that displays every bit as much brilliance as the tales -- if not more.  Concerns Comus Bassington, a  worthless, Dorian Gray-like libertine living around the turn of the  century, and the gradual dissolution of his life. Biting satire of  materialism, written with vigor and beauty; a short of Bernard Shaw by way  of Oscar Wilde (incidentally, the novel contains a mockery of Shaw, in the  character of a playwright named Sherard Blaw!).  Ardent readers are urged  to find this gem and enjoy every minute of it.	2000-03-31

He takes a long-range  spiritual view, often with a New Testament perspective, of this intricate  and tricky Old Testament masterpiece.  There were many times when I simply  read aloud to my adult students lengthy paragraphs from Wilcock's book.   Very level-headed, reverent, and insightful.

While it took me a while to get rolling on  the novel, it soon proved impossible to put down -- a work of incredible  depth and beauty, combining the vividness of Lawrence, the emotional power  of Dickens, and the universality of Shakespeare.  I'll admit I haven't read  the other novel -- &quot;Eugenie Grandet&quot; -- in this collection, but  &quot;Pere Goriot&quot; was a reading experience I will not soon forget.

I came to it through the Merchant-Ivory film &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge,&quot; which combines both this and its twin, &quot;Mrs. Bridge.&quot;  &quot;Mr. Bridge&quot; is  possibly the gentlest satire I've ever read -- looking piteously but  critically at an upper-middle-class businessman in the 1940s who loves  money and stocks so much that he actually gives each member of his family  (including the kids!) shares in Kansas City Power and Light for Christmas.   Somewhat reminiscent of Ishiguro's &quot;Remains of the Day&quot; in its  sympathetic but potent indictment of a man who stakes everything on  &quot;business&quot; and has absolutely no understanding of himself.   Brilliantly characterized and beautifully written, this is a treasure not  to be missed.  The final chapter is virtually perfect.	2000-03-30

Along with Louis Armstrong's  version of &quot;Potato Head Blues,&quot; Gustave Flaubert's  &quot;Sentimental Education&quot; makes the list.  Allen was right.  This  is undeniably one of the finest novels ever written.  I hated &quot;Madame  Bovary,&quot; with its pessimistic fatalism and distasteful characters, but  &quot;SE&quot; is, in more ways than one, an entirely different story -- a  panoply of widely varying characters centering around one young man and his  seemingly endless attempts to set up a tryst with the married woman he  loves.  Perhaps no other novel has been written that better exemplifies the  &quot;romantic spirit&quot; -- in its classical sense.  The book also has  prose passages of breath-taking beauty.

Ahh --  the creator of the great Sherlock Holmes tackles dinosaurs!  In the first novel in this collection, Doyle's lesser-known protagonist, George Edward Challenger, leads an expedition to a South American plateau  where prehistoric life still exists.  While there's a bit too much  Doyle-style propaganda here about evolution and cavemen (remember Doyle  sought &quot;the missing link&quot;), it's a fine piece of storytelling  from the man who must be acknowledged as the first &quot;dinosaur  novelist&quot; -- and whose title Crichton ripped off, without so much as a  thanks-a-lot!  There are four other tales here as well involving Challenger  -- a worthy collection indeed!	2000-03-29

The title tale is a fine piece of work, but two others, &quot;Dearest Clarissa&quot; and &quot;The Spider,&quot; are even better; the first is a  masterpiece of subtle tension between what the first-person narrator knows  and what the reader slowly figures out; the latter is not to be read by  people who are afraid of spiders!

He's one of those writers by whom I must read a book every two or three years -- but this one I did not like at all.  Despite the usual brilliant prose, much of it as good as  anything Conrad has done, &quot;Tether&quot; is a let-down -- astoundingly  depressing!  Most Conrad work posits a world that is inimical and uncaring,  yet holds out hope that courage and integrity will serve to help us endure  it all; &quot;Tether&quot; holds out no such hope.  It concerns a captain  who continues to pilot his ship even though he is legally blind, doing so  in order to provide for his family.  Nothing turns out okay, and no one  ends up happy.  I don't ask for a lot of hope from the books I read -- but  at least a little!	2000-03-29

Expertly researched and written maritime thriller in the solid tradition of Alistair MacLean and Hammond Innes.  Terrific atmosphere aboard a tug that salvages wrecked ships -- and with much knowledge to impart about the  little-known salvage business.  Strong plotting, lots of gritty action,  including a nuclear device -- but a bit too much death and bloodshed for my  tastes.  Callison seems to enjoy bumping off major characters, often in a  somewhat grisly way, and this happened a few too many times to conform to  the traditional thriller plot (a al Innes) where the bad guys &quot;get  theirs&quot; and the good guys win.  Not a bad, book, though, for those  who've run out of MacLean novels to read.	2000-03-28
