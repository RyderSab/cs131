Books in the \\"American Decade Series\\" are designed to give its readers a glimpse of American history decade by decade. \\"The 1970s\\" is no exception. Historians often balk at the amateurish approach of presenting history decades by decade. While this approach may be somewhat simplistic, it can serve as an excellent teaching method for introducing new material to students. <br />\\"The 1970s\\" starts with a well rounded introduction, it then presents its thirty essays, or chapters from other books, on various issues prevalent in the 1970s. These topics are further broken down into international issues in the 1970s, national issues in the 1970s, environment, energy, and automobiles in the 1970s, popular culture in the 1970s, women's issues in the 1970s and from the 1970s into the future. The makeup and selection serves as a well-balanced approach to understanding the decade. No particular area is over represented. Each essay includes a brief bio of the writer. Additionally, the book is well served with an excellent chronology of events, recommendations for further study and an index. At 320 pages, \\"The 1970s\\" is a good choice for honor students in high school or possible a good textbook for a college level course on 20th century America.	2003-02-25

Dorsett for the ?Library of Religious Biography? series and published by Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company is a short, yet well rounded and objective, biography of Billy Sunday.<br />A first-rate biography covering Billy Sunday from A-Z in less than 160 pages: no small task considering the importance of Billy Sunday and early 20th Century evangelism.<br />However, Dorsett subtitle is somewhat misleading: ?and the Redemption of Urban America,? as he only devotes one chapter to it and its mainly regarding Billy Sunday?s pitfalls regarding his enormous financial success in from 1908-1920.  Very little detail on Sunday?s most historically significant reform movements: movements heavily tied towards his Midwestern background and Mid-America?s fear of industrialization and urbanization in the early 20th Century: temperance and prohibition legislation, Sunday closing laws, gambling, card playing, reading love novels, Saturday and Sunday drives in the county with members of the opposite sex in that devilish automobile when you should have been going to church, non-religious dancing and music, liberalism, evolution, alleged decadent dress and loss morals of modern women and the general discontentment of masculine Christianity in early 20th Century America. Topics covered in greater detail in Roger A. Bruns?, ?Preacher: Billy Sunday and Big-Time American Evangelism? and in Robert Francis Martin?s ?Hero of the Heartland: Billy Sunday and the Transformation of America.?<br />Regrettable too is the lack of footnotes or endnotes in his text: only a brief section towards the end of his book on sources.<br />Included in his biography are two complete sermons of Billy Sunday in the appendix titled, ?Heaven? and ?Get on the Water Wagon.? Two important sermons of Sunday that Dorsett believes have been misquoted by other biographers and historians.<br /><br />While it is lacking in significant detail concerning these reform movements, it is still a first-rate and objective biography of Billy Sunday that can be read in a short amount of time.	2003-01-16

Kinzer produced a detailed history of the APA. \\"Episode in Anti-Catholicism: The American Protective Association,\\" is a well-rounded history of the movement. Kinzer successfully shows how strong the movement was in the Midwest and in emerging urban industrial centers such as Detroit, Michigan and Toledo, Ohio. Kinzer also asserts that the movement gained additional momentum during economic downturns. The depression of 1893 was a key factor in the growth of the APA. <br />Donald L. Kinzer has a wonderful bibliography and epilogue where he describes the continuation of anti-Catholicism following its heyday in the 1890s. As the APA vanished, Kinzer declared, anti-Catholicism was still very much alive and well. Yet, his weakness lies in his inability to see how anti-Catholicism transformed itself from an urban to a rural phenomenon.<br />Kinzer provides an excellent add-on with a listing of the APA presses.  Organized by state by state with a cross-reference of cities.<br />His book is a good historical inquiry for historical researchers and historians interested in the history of labor and working class history, urban history, social/cultural history, economic history, nativist history or political, sociological or ethnic studies.	2002-12-24

Husband's \\"Godless Communists\\": Atheism and Society in Soviet Russia, 1917-1932 is a study of the recently formed communist government and its attempts to obliterate religious practices within its borders.  It is also an analysis of how everyday Russians responded to their government's attempted demolition of their religious life and culture.  In his introduction, Husband argues (p. xii) that atheism was absolutely vital for the new communist state.  While understanding the importance of atheism within communism, Husband later points out, in his introduction, that, \\"Deeply embedded in Russian culture, Orthodoxy shaped rituals of hospitality and celebrations, rites of passage, the ordering of daily and seasonal routines, and household organization\\" (p. xiii).  Clearly then, atheism was a key part of Communist ideology. <br />Covering the period from the November revolution through 1932, Husband's text illustrates the shifting and challenging relationship between church and state.   In chapter one, \\"Belief and Nonbelief in Prerevolutionary Russia,\\" he describes pre-revolution Russian religious life and asserts that customs, rituals and rites were more important than Orthodox doctrine in defining Russian culture.   Next, in \\"Revolutions and Antireligious Policy\\" Husband describes the prevailing conditions in post-revolution Russia regarding the states attempts to end the influence of the church.  Here he shows that Communist doctrine did not overnight change Russia's interconnectedness with the Orthodox faith. Rather, it revealed how individuals responded differently to repressive regimes. While there were extremes of both ultra-religious and ultra-anti-religious, the real participants were everyday citizens and local officials.  <br />Husband then takes chapter four, \\"Materialism and the Secularization of Society\\" and chapter five, \\"Soviet Family Values\\" to describe how everyday citizen responded to the state and how that state attempted to shape post-revolutionary culture and society. In chapter four, Husband illustrates the state's attempts to change religious holidays into secular holidays.  Just as the Roman Catholic Empire had difficultly weeding out pagan practices during the early middle ages, Soviets had similar difficultly turning the religious rites and rituals into secular ones.  The state's successfulness at secularization often varied from region to region. The degree of the state's limited success was well described in Husband's analysis regarding \\"quasi-religious\\" rituals, such as funerals.  Husband illustrates that even Lenin's funeral had some religious overtones, \\"His body was not cremated in the revolutionary faction but embalmed, displayed for forty days...and ultimately housed in a mausoleum\\" (p. 96).  When the most anti-religious leader had religious overtones represented in his funeral, obviously religion was not promptly removed from Russian society. <br />Chapter five approaches the family and the individual.  Here Husband concludes the individual, \\"not only synthesized competing interpretations of belief in the supernatural, but what is more important, they blended traditional with revolutionary values\\" (p.128-129).  This \\"blending\\" was the major way individuals' accommodated their faith with the ideology imposed on them by the state. <br />Nowhere else is this central point of accommodation more demonstrated than in chapter six, which serves as his conclusion.  In chapter five, \\"Resistance, Circumvention, Accommodation,\\" he summaries the central issues, in a topical and chronological order, surrounding \\"repression and resistance,\\" \\"resistance and retribution,\\" \\"revolutionary legality and circumvention\\" and \\"accommodation and indifference\\" from the post-revolution period all the way through 1932 regarding Russian religious practices and their interactions with the state.  <br />Regarding his sources, Husband uses a full allotment of primary and secondary sources.  Primary sources include: police records, newspapers (Bezbozhnik, Antireligioznik), and contemporary letters, publications and books.  Many of his sources came from several state (former USSR) archives, largely citing the State Museum of History of Religion in St. Petersburg and in chapter one, he relies heavily on secondary sources (journals/scholarly/publications/books) relating to Russian social and cultural history during the period.  Additionally, he includes a useful epilogue, glossary, selected bibliography and index. <br />Regarding objectivity, Husband approaches his topic with an open mind.  He offers contrary evidence to his thesis when he included evidence showing the level of resistance by some participants, but later proves that accommodation was the stronger form of action among individuals and soviet society during this period.  While objective in his arguments, he was selective in his work.  Religions and ethnics groups historically had been a very significant part of Russian history.  While not the dominant religion, Judaism, Islam, Non-Orthodox Christianity and other faiths were noticeably diverse in the cultural makeup of its society.  Yet, they go largely unrecorded in \\"Godless Communists.\\"  While Husband did illuminate on some of the splinter movements within the Russian Orthodox Church, his study, more or less, is solely about Russian Orthodoxy.  This makes his title very misleading.  If someone is interested in learning about the government treatment towards Jews or Muslims, during the early period of communism, they will be misguided by his title.  <br />Despite its misleading title, William B. Husband's \\"Godless Communists\\": Atheism and Society in Soviet Russia, 1917-1932 offers a deeper understanding of how everyday Russians responded to their states desires to diminish the role of religion within their larger society and more specifically, their individual lives.  As Husband successfully argues, average individual stakeholders and not the militant \\"Godless\\" or \\"Godly\\" ultimately determined the policies and realities of religious practices within Soviet Russia.  While a work of history, \\"Godless Communist\\" should also be considered as a work of sociology, especially considering the importance Husband places on the individual regarding his or her decision to reject, accommodate or accept indoctrinations of cultural values and beliefs.<br />William Husband's writing style can be best described as plainly academic and historical.  Yet, he is able to offer a sociological flair in his writing.  This is especially true with his description of processes an individual undertook in choosing to accommodate his or her faith.  Or in how an individual became indifferent towards it and the potential economic and social ramifications in his or her decision. Additionally, his writing style is also very egalitarian in the sense that he is writing history, comparatively, from the \\"bottom up\\" of the societal scale, instead of retelling the religious conflicts between the party elites who opposed all forms of religiosity in a Soviet state, such as the League of the Militant Godless or the activist clergy of the Orthodox Church defending their faith.	2002-12-19

While Goldberg's book presents his readers with an introduction of the discontented during the 1920s, because of its specialization, it also serves as an original historical inquiry.<br />Goldberg emphasis is to illustrate the disillusionment that was a direct result of the war. According to Goldberg, the discontent of the twenties was largely due to the early ending of World War I. Goldberg coverage includes: post-war foreign policy, decline of labor, red scare, African Americans, rise of second KKK, anti-immigration policies and the presidential election of 1928. While these areas of discontentment were largely a direct result of the war, there were other areas not addressed in his book.<br />Goldberg offers a selective picture, but it is not the entire picture. Areas not covered include: (1) the plight of the American farmer, (2) rural and small town discontentment against the larger more industrial cities, (3) conflict between modernist/liberals verse the conservatives/fundamentalist movements, (4) discontent between the generations and the emergence of a youth culture, (5) coverage of sentiment shared by many Americans of the enormous loss of life resulting from the war and the influenza outbreak and its influences on the brief return in the Spiritualist movements and finally, (6) returning veterans with their disillusionment towards the war, government in general, foreign policy and their eventual support of the isolationist movements in the thirties and early forties.

Voegeli's book covers the following midwestern States: Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin during the war years of 1861, 1862, 1863, 1864 and 1865. <br />For those of you who believed the Midwest symbolized the devoutly religious and piously tolerant Yankees who passionately opposed slavery will be traumatized after reading Voegeli's book. As disturbing as Voegeli's study is, his readers will come out of the experience with a deeper understanding of the variable attitudes held toward African Americans in the Midwest during the Civil War. <br />\\"Except for the South,\\" Voegeli contends the Midwest, \\"was the region most firmly committed to white supremacy\\"(p 1). To substantiate his thesis, Voegeli formulates four major hypotheses. (1) Midwesterners were hostile towards African Americans migrating into the Midwest. (2) They believed African Americans were inferior to whites; (3) They believed African Americans were not well suited for the colder climate of the Midwest. (4) These inhospitable attitudes delayed and hindered Lincoln's administrative policies toward liberation, confiscation and emancipation of African Americans escaping slavery. <br />V. Jacque Voegeli's employed a full scope of primary and secondary sources to tell his story. Mainly relying on primary sources such as newspaper accounts and official correspondences, Voegeli offers a first-class analysis of an exceptionally difficult and bulky subject. The scope of his evidence is shown in his countless endnotes and his superbly compiled bibliographical essay. His bibliographical essay categorizes sources by manuscripts collection, government documents (Federal and State), newspapers, periodicals, correspondence, diaries, memoirs, autobiographies, biographies, regional histories, local histories and finally, multiple Civil War monographs. <br />Throughout his study he provides good historical scholarship. His analysis pinpoints key concepts that have, in the past, been confused by other historians. For example, many historians confuse, or don't even realize, the variable causations between the racial rioting of 1862 and 1863. Oftentimes historians confuse these dates, since they were approximately one-year apart (July 1862/July 1863). Historians have stated, inaccurately, that both periods of rioting were in response to the Civil War draft. In reality, only the 1863 riots dealt principally with the Conscription Act. Contrary, the riots of 1862 resulted from the fears of African American migration and competition for laboring jobs in the north. <br />Is Voegeli biased? Does he tell the entire story? Despite the fact that Voegeli is accurate, he does have some biases that hamper his credibility as an objective historian. A particular bias shows in his inability to inform his readers of the full story regarding the different levels of tolerance toward African Americans in the Midwest. In the first few pages of his book, were he writes: <br />\\"Here and there, a spirit of moderation eased their [African Americans] plight. A few districts in Ohio's Western Reserve allowed colored children to attend white schools and sometimes permitted Negroes to vote and to hold office.... Free Negro immigrants and fugitive slaves found havens of refuge in Quaker settlements in Indian, Ohio, and Cass County, Michigan. Nevertheless, islands or racial toleration were rare in the Midwest\\"(pp 2-3). <br />While this is true, he should have included more coverage of the occasional tolerant midwesterners, rather than merely mentioning them in his introduction. While I agree, the Midwest was very intolerant towards African Americans, but not everyone shared such negative views. The viewpoints of the moderately tolerant midwesterners were markedly more popular than Voegeli contends. By not including these differences(in the levels of tolerance) by several communities in the Midwest, it undermines his otherwise excellent book. <br />Also evident is his analysis regarding the views held by the moderate Republicans and Unionists midwesterners towards African Americans and their opinions of African Americans working in the North. Clearly from Voegeli's argument, he tries persuading his readers that prior to emancipation, most moderates were against African Americans competing for jobs in the Midwest. He furthermore contends, for the most part, radical Republicans where also hesitant in allowing Africans Americans to work in the Midwest. While some may have held such beliefs, it apparently was not a black and white issue--as Voegeli contends. In contrast, many moderates and radicals midwesterners welcomed African Americans. <br />While I would recommend, \\"Free but Not Equal,\\" one does need to read it with some scrutiny in light of his possible biases. At the same time Voegeli provides a brilliant awareness of the racial policies and attitudes in the Midwest during the Civil War. \\"Free but Not Equal\\" is a significant book on how these attitudes effected the political and military actions of the Lincoln Administration. With this recommendation, I would also propose that one should read other inquiries for an enhanced awareness of the Midwest and its unique history sounding emancipations and the issues of African American migration into the Midwest. Two excellent inquiries are: Frank Klement's, \\"The Copperhead in the Middle West,\\" or James McPherson's, \\"The Negro's Civil War\\".	2002-08-27

Historians are continuously battling over its interpretations and many schools of thought have emerged on the subject. As with any controversial subject, it is the historian's job to approach his or her subject with objectivity. Biased and subjective interpretations have no place in historical scholarship. While Botwinick is a passionate and persuasive writer, her total lack of objectivity inflicts a subjective, biased, prejudiced, dogmatic and narrow-minded analysis of the Holocaust.<br />An objective historian will let the facts speak for themselves. A good historian doesn't throw out unsubstantiated facts, launch name-calling attacks and make uncorroborated assumptions on foreign policies. You tell the stories of history by placing the historical evidence in its proper place; you then communicate its meaning in its proper historical contexts. History is not bending historical evidence to substantiate your desired outcome; your only outcome is to disseminate historical facts so your readers can judge for themselves.<br />Regrettably her book is riddled with subjective excuses, biased assumptions, unsubstantiated facts, contradicting statements and name-calling.<br />A few examples: <br />Current political interjection: \\"Jewish achievements in the areas of literature, science, philosophy, and religion remains monuments to an age of greatness realized by virtue of the bygone spirit of Islamic tolerance\\" (p 10). <br />Biased assumption: \\"All major Christian denominations, however, were united in their animosity towards Jews\\" (p 11). <br />Subjective excuses and counter negative projection on Christianity regarding the misogyny within the Judaism: \\"Actually, Jewish women were probably less subjugated than their Christian contemporaries\\" (p 35).<br />Biased assumptions regarding Germany in the 1930s: \\"The circumstances experienced by Germans in the early 1930s were not unique; other nationalities faced similar difficulties\\" (p 47).<br />Subjective excuses and underplaying the importance of the Versailles Treaty: \\"The treaty was harsh, that is unless one considers the terms of the agreement the Germans forced on the defeated Russians in 1918 at Brest-Litovsk\\" (p 47). <br />Name-calling: \\"master of the big lie,\\" (p 65); \\"brain of a lunatic\\" (p 84); \\"hooligan\\" (p 114); \\"bullies\\" (p 121).<br />Contradicting statements: \\"The Germans always made money from their captives\\" (p 165) and contradicting the previous statement with the following, \\"None of the killers were permitted to profit in any way from the death of the Jews\\" (p 177).<br />Subjective statement and assumptions with political interjection: \\"As the leader of the free world during the war, the burden of inactivity falls heavily on the United States\\" (p 208).<br />Inappropriate political declaration: \\"Israeli success in its struggle to survive against great odds is a legacy for all Jews\\" (p 218).<br />If she could balance her text with more objectivity and remove her baises she would have the making of a very good book.	2002-08-09

Art historian David Deitcher has made a major contribution to our understanding of the American male. In particular, David, shows the importance of 19th century intimate male relationships.  Mainly through multiple period photographs of intimate men and a well-rounded historical analysis of male sexuality, David argues that intimate relationships between men were fairly common in the 19th century.  In particular, David contends, temporary and oftentimes intimate relationships occurred between men in their late teens and early twenties before they married.  <br />Dear Friends shows that there is no clear distinction on what male sexuality represents, or that one's sexual orientation is permanent and fixed. Men and the relationships they share with one another are distinct and important for us to study, understand and value.  By doing so, we gain a healthier understanding of ourselves.  Dear Fiends shows what we (modern-day American males) can learn from our 19th century counter-parts in helping us better understand ourselves and our relationships we share with other men throughout our lives.	2002-07-15

The Devil in the Shape of a Woman is a study of New England witchcraft during the 17th and early 18th centuries and its interconnectedness with womanhood. While most studies on colonial witchcraft are concerned with the Salem outbreaks in the late 17th century, Carol Karlsen's approach is to examine New England witchcraft as a whole and argue, persuasively, for its particular influences on colonial women. <br />To appropriately grasp the history of New England witchcraft, Professor Karlsen argues, it is imperative to understand the role of women in colonial society (xiii). Karlsen further argues that past historians have scarcely noted the misogyny of the witchcraft craze in New England. Rather than continue this practice, Professor Karlsen gains a greater understanding of these witch crazes, through the study of women in Colonial New England society. Karlsen asserts: \\"Only by understanding that the history of witchcraft is primarily a history of women, however, can we confront the deeply embedded feelings about women\\". <br />  Karlsen uses a great deal of primary and secondary sources to support her thesis. With nearly one hundred pages of supportive details, Karlsen provides a wealth of documentation. She uses first hand accounts of witch trails. A good example is her use of Cotton Mather's personal writings. Mather provides interesting insight regarding the attitudes towards women commonly held by the colonial elites. Her next major types of sources are court records. These records detail court proceedings, depositions and court rulings. Furthermore, statistics, drawn from these records, provide the basic arguments for Karlsen's book. While she relies mainly on primary sources, Karlsen does use secondary sources on woman's history, colonial society and recent witchcraft scholarship. <br /> In addition to her sources, Karlsen provides an excellent research tool in her appendix. Here she includes an alphabetical listing of accused witches and their brief history describing their cases. This addition makes, The Devil in the Shape of a Woman, more manageable for her readers. <br /> The book begins with a brief history of the colonial witchcraft. Each chapters is structured with an orientation, presentation of evidence and her conclusion. A good example of her structure is in chapter two, on the demographics of witchcraft, here she summarizes the importance of age and marital status in witchcraft accusations--The essential arguments of chapter 2. Following this summary, she provides a good transition into the her next chapter [Chapter 3: The Economic Basis of Witchcraft] in the final sentence of chapter two, \\"A closer look at the material conditions and behavior of the accused reveals other characteristics-intimately related to their sex, age, and marital status-that set witches apart from other older women in their community.\\"<br /> In substantiating her claim about the importance and the interconnectedness of colonial womanhood and witchcraft, Karlsen examines the colonial beliefs on witchcraft and the rampant misogyny of the period. In this study she addresses the accused and the accusers, the young, the old, the poor and the elite. She even constructs an interesting analysis and statistically significant interpretation of those females who were possessed and why these particular females responded to their possession in Puritan society-[see Chapter Seven: Brand Plucked out of the Burning.]<br />In order to prove her case, Professor Karlsen mainly uses statistical evidence associated with those who were the accusers and the accused during the witchcraft trails. Through the use of statistical evidence, Karlsen produces her most historically significant findings linking colonial witchcraft and colonial womanhood. On the whole, Karlsen proves that women who were out of the social norms of colonial society were more likely to be suspect of witchcraft. In Puritan New England this mainly meant non-married women, widows and nonconformist females. These distinctive behaviors and demographics were seen as potential threat to New England society, especially during period of great change or social upheaval.<br /> In addition, Karlsen has established, statistically, that women who were married, but had no children, women who were married, but had only daughters, and finally, women who were daughters of parents who had no male offspring were more vulnerable to calls of witchcraft (pg. 101). What this shows is the clear linkage of economic interest and the importance of inheritance in witchcraft accusations in colonial society. Karlsen argues, \\"Inheritance disputes surface frequently enough in witchcraft cases, cropping up as part of the general context even when no direct link between the dispute and the charge is discernible, to suggest the fears that underlay most accusations\\". Karlsen goes on to assert that women with inheritance rights were more susceptible to accusation of witchcraft throughout the entire history of Colonial New England witchcraft than those women who did not have inheritance privileges. <br /> While statistics were effectively used in several areas of Karlsen's book, I had to keep asking myself an important and relevant question. Is Professor Karlsen an historian or a statistician? Surely she has added significant insight into colonial woman and the history of witchcraft, but it also seems probable that she has, on occasions, overused statistics. Would it not be an historical fallacy to assume something purely based on statistics? While Karlsen does include other forms of evidence to prove her arguments besides statistics, they are, unfortunately, in need of further development. By over-emphasizing statistics, The Devil in the Shape of a Woman undermines its otherwise, excellent argument. <br /> While Carol Karlsen has argues that other historians has neglected the influences of women in Colonial New England witchcraft history, she has done just the opposite. Rather, she has focused her study specifically towards the role of women in colonial society. Since The Devil in the Shape of a Women is aimed towards the women's role in colonial witchcraft history, it is not a complete history of witchcraft in Colonial New England. In view of that, I can only recommend, The Devil in the Shape of a Woman with reservations. Rather, I would recommend that The Devil in the Shape of a Woman be read with other works on colonial society in order place its history in a broader viewpoint. Only through a more comprehensive understanding of the social, political, religious, environmental and generational factors that shaped colonial society can we truly come to terms with the impact women had on New England society and their particular relevance to their witchcraft accusations and the subsequent witch craze.	2002-06-27

The second edition of Economics: Principles and Tools by O'Sullivan/Sheffrin provides a good introduction to both macro and microeconomics. This was especially true for me since my math skills aren't up to par. It was manageable and understandable for those who don't do well with numbers. The CD was helpful in understanding the graphs that were involved in textbook. In addition to providing an introduction to economics, it does a good job of helping you understand how you can use economics in your everyday life. Especially in chapter two where they introduce five economic principles you will reuse throughout your economic course and in your daily life: (1) principle of opportunity cost, (2) marginal principle, (3) principle of diminishing returns, (4) spillover principle, (5) reality principle. Economics: Principles and Tools is an excellent resource and textbook for anyone who has a limited knowledge of economics and is willing to learn these five economic principles.	2001-12-13

Only Yesterday offers a glimpse into the nineteen twenties from someone who actually lived it.  First published in 1931, Frederick Lewis Allen writes of a decade that had just past.  Most historians will tell you that it takes about twenty years after a decade before you can truly come to terms with what the decade was all about.  However, this was not the case with Frederick Lewis Allen's work.  He was able to show the decade for what it was, a truly amazing accomplishment in 1931!  <br />     His purpose was to show future generations, what his generation considered important in defining their times. In doing so he helped create a bridge between his generation and future generations who would later conduct research on the 1920s.  In fact, while studying this period one soon find out, most historical works on the 1920s site Only Yesterday in their bibliographies.  In fact, a through and comprehensive study of this period is not possible unless it includes Frederick Lewis Allen's works.  <br />     Furthermore, Fredrick Lewis Allen attempted to record the social and cultural history of the times.  In 1931 this was a new and different form of history.  (Just about as radical as the 1920s.) Frederick Lewis Allen can be regarded as a pioneer social historian. Prior to his work most mainstream histories were based solely on politics and international affairs. <br />     More than half of Only Yesterday is on social and cultural events, which is one of the strongest points in his book.  With the exceptions of chapters two and six, \\"Back To Normalcy\\" and \\"Harding And The Scandals\\", Allen's writings are geared towards the common people and how events of the day and the cultural changes affected them. These events and cultural changes are clearly illustrated in chapters five, \\"The Revolution In Manners And Morals\\" and chapters eight, \\"The Ballyhoo Years\\".  Allen was able to show his readers the major social/cultural events of the 1920s.  An example is his coverage of the automobile and the \\"Red Scare\\" in the early years of the decade. Clearly his coverage of these two events are his strongest points.  <br />     His writing style deserves some mentioning.  He writes in a style that allows for a multitude of readership interest areas: politics, social, cultural, industrial, religion and even sports. This is especially seen in his sometimes-humorous approach in covering certain topics.  Another, great example of his writing abilities is his narrowing of a central point at the conclusion of his paragraph. <BR> <BR>     Despite his strengths in his writing and his coverage, something must be said regarding his lack of a bibliography.  Without one, it weakens his work.  When you find something interesting, you have no way of looking for sources.  Furthermore, he was not able to pick up on the population changes taking place in the 1920s.  Rural to urban population changes were not addressed, nor was the \\"great migration\\" of African American coming to northern cities addressed either.  Today, one just need to be aware of these event in the 1920s, Allen in the 1930s just wasn't able, for whatever reason, to see the importance of these events.<br />     Without any doubt, the strength of his work certainly out number his few weaknesses.  I truly enjoy reading Allen's book.  In the future I will revisit Allen's work for his superb writing style and his gift of narrowing his main points at the end of his paragraphs.  A truly remarkable book!	2001-11-11
