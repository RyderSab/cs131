If your a man and just can't seem to figure out woman, then this book is not necessarily for you. I would encourage you to read John Eldredge's, the co-authors other book, \\"Wild at Heart\\". It touches on everything in this book, and will also help you understand yourself better as a man, which in turn will help you come to a better understanding of what makes woman tick. If you are a male that is into counseling woman then I would recommend this book to you.<br /><br />From my interaction with woman over the years, I can see this book bringing healing to many a woman's life, as long as they give the book a chance and are honest with themselves. I do see some anger in some of the other reviews, but I really think these reviewers are just missing the point.<br /><br />As a man I do find the type of woman that the author tries to lead all woman to become, to be the only ones that I truly find Captivating. And no matter what some people would say, as a woman you are entitled to be Captivating. So buy the book and enjoy becoming all that you can be.	2005-09-04

The author Dan Kimball, discusses the problems that Christianity and the modern church are facing, and gives the reader lots of examples on all the different aspects of how one can present Christianity in a more effective and appealing way in this post-modern world.<br /><br />Dan is not trying to force a certain model on the reader, but only gives ideas to help them find what works in their own situations.<br /><br />This book has comments throughout from Rick Warren, Howard Hendricks, Brian McLaren, Sally Morgenthaler, Chip Ingram and Mark Oestreicher.<br /><br />Anyone involved in the ministry (Aren't all Christians?) will find this book not only helpful, but will also give them hope for our post-modern culture.	2005-06-04

The author, Arnold Ehret's theories on diet and Fasting where ahead of there time, and probably some of his theories still are.<br /><br />The Mucusless Diet and it's many benefits are not only explained in great detail, but I admire the way the author was willing to put his theories to the test on himself. The book also explains a bit about Fasting, but the authors book \\"Rational Fasting\\" is a much better Fasting book.<br /><br />Quite an interesting book and the price is right.	2005-05-17

This book concentrates on the Lemonade Fast and the benefits that the author experienced from it. It talks a bit about his diet theories and how they relate to Fasting and he also lightly touches base on the Mental and Spiritual aspects of Fasting.<br /><br />I would say that some of the authors theories are still ahead of their time but being that the book was written such a long time ago, some of his theories are becoming quite dated.<br /><br />Half of the book ends up with 8 of the authors essays, which are more or less used as filler.<br /><br />Quite a good book overall. But I would also recommend the books \\"The Master Cleanser\\" and \\"The Fasting Path\\" to go along with this book.	2005-05-17

If your looking for a short how to do a Lemonade Fast book, this is the book for you. If your also interested in all the Physical, Spiritual and Emotional benefits of fasting, you should also buy the book \\"The Fasting Path\\" by Stephen Harrod Buhner, because this book doesn't really go into any of these things.<br /><br />I did this fast for 18 days myself and found it quite helpful. You not only get your teenage 6-pack back, you finally develop an appreciation for healthy foods and become allot stronger when it comes to the emotional aspects of dealing with food.<br /><br />A great fast to be on if you need to keep physically active. And you can't beat the price. Buy it, but also buy the other book I have recommended above.	2005-05-16

I read this book after I completed an 18 day Lemonade Fast. I wish I would have read it first though, because it concentrates on Water Fasting, whereas the other books I had previously read where strictly about Lemonade Fasting.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Lemonade Fasting has it's place, but water fasting sounds superior and quicker if done properly. This book also covers Lemonade and Juice Fasting, and not only that, it covers in great depth, all the Spiritual, Emotional and Physical benefits of fasting.<br /><br />An excellent book that I would highly recommend to anyone that is on a journey of holistic healing.	2005-05-16

It seems to touch on a little bit of each aspect of using concrete for floors, walls, countertops, etc. But really doesn't go into too much depth, which leaves it up to the reader to do lots of their own experimenting. I would like to have seen the book about twice as thick, with a section more devoted to all the different colour variations and textures that the author has come up with.<br /><br />People tend to buy books like these so they don't have to spend a bunch of money on trial and error testing. And I think this book could have been a whole lot better in that department.<br /><br />There is some really nice concrete work in this book that will get the  imagination fired up. And there is also some pretty corny concrete work, that may turn some people off. Lots of photo's of some of the kitchens the author has done. Not exactly Johnny Grey work, but quite nice.<br /><br />Even though I only gave it 3 stars, I would still recommend it.	2005-04-07

Being that 3/4 of this book is on the science of breathing, I, like some of the other reviewers was kind of dissapointed, since I was expecting more practicle breathing exercies. But one tends to realize after reading it, that you do need to understand what the breathing techniques are actually physically doing if you want to master them.<br /><br />I think a good book to read after this one is \\"The Secret of the Golden Flower\\" by Thomas Cleary.<br /><br />For both these books, the price is right and the reading fascinating.	2005-03-26

I think it all depends on how ready you are not only spiritually, but also how much studying you have already done on the subject of the Human Energy Field.

The second book in the New Kind of Christian Series, the author continues to weave the tale of Neo, Dan, family and friends. And as in the first book he continues to make you sit back and ask yourself, \\"why do I believe what I believe\\". At the same time he gives you the answer, and if your not missing the point, you will find this book making your faith in God stronger every chapter.<br /><br />You don't have to embrace everything in this story as the gospel truth, I don't think that is what the author is trying to do. He is trying to make you ask questions, and at the same time, gently giving you some answers to these questions.<br /><br />These questions and answers will probably take most Christians out of their comfort zone, since what our modern church teaches is not questioned very much and on the most part, blindly followed. Personally I think we need get back to the core of God's word, not man's interpretations and this book has a knack for doing that.<br /><br />As I said about the first book, buy one, buy two, give as gifts. Change is needed, the word needs to get out, and this story is a great way to do it.	2005-03-21

Owning quite a few Vernacular Building type books, I would say that this rates up there with the best of them. I will not say it is the best though, the reason being is that all of these types of books have their own unique photos that you won't find any where else.<br /><br />This is a very well produced, easy to read book.  It is broken up into 18 sections, with lots of full colour photos from around the world. Each photo also comes with a short explanation.<br /><br />With 469 pages of beautiful photographs not only showing the architecture, but also the people living in these dwellings, this book is a must have for your Vernacular Library.<br /><br />Hmmm...

From Europe, America, Asia and Africa this book gives a small picture of people that have brought to life their unique visions of what their environments/dwellings should look like.<br /><br />The book is quite short, 191 small pages, with pictures usually taking up two of them. It has a little bit of text explaining who built what and where it's located on a few separate pages, making it a nuisance having to jump back and forth, trying to figure out who made what. It would have been nice to have some in depth history on the buildings and their builders.<br /><br />Otherwise this book does have a bunch of quite eccentric buildings that you probably haven't seen in any other books. If your interested in this type of stuff, the price is right, so go for it.	2005-03-11

I found this book quite refreshing, being that it wasn't written with allot of new-age, eastern mysticism, mumbo-jumbo like most of the books on this topic are.<br /><br />The author probes deeply into how the human energy field effects the human psyche and vise versa. He explains the methodology on how he has arrived at his conclusions and gives many real world examples.<br /><br />This is not only a great book for someone who is interested in doing their own mental and emotional healing, but it should be in the library of all Psychiatrists and anyone else who deals with people on a mental/emotional level.<br /><br />A must have for anyone interested in holistic healing.	2005-03-04

This book is a fascinating, yet tragic tale, of a man who not only invented a microscope that was ahead of it's time, but 'cures' for cancer and most other diseases, using a machine that used different frequencies. This man, Royal Rife,  had to constantly battle with the corrupt Medical Cartel that is only concerned about the almighty dollar. It makes one sick to think about how much good his work could have been for world, except it was destroyed and is still being suppressed. I am glad that Barry Lynes wrote this book though, and hope that it will continue to spark peoples desires to carry on Rife's work.<br /><br />On the side, I would like to mention there is now more and more ongoing tests with RIFE type machines. And that quite advanced RIFE type machines can be bought nowadays. They are around $5000.00 US. Make sure they have a plasma tube and not just the pads if you want a genuine and more effective RIFE type machine.	2005-01-29

Well lets start off with the ugly and work our way to the good.<br /><br />This book is the worst edited book I have ever read in my entire life! I am SO glad to be done. 542 pages, and the author repeats himself about every 4 pages! And then to top it off he has 'A Quick Review' chapter!!! This book could have been edited down to about 1/3 it's size, which would have made it allot more effective for him to get his theories across. One star subtracted for poor editing.<br /><br />The author throws in the theory of evolution, which for the most part, is one of the most ridiculous theories ever presented to man-kind. Throwing this theory into the mix takes away lots of his credibility. Another star subtracted for using other peoples theories.<br /><br />Now for the good. This book can be quite interesting if you can handle reading it for long enough stretches. The author has some interesting theories on Germs, Viruses, Disease, Immunization, Metaphysics and the most fascinating of his theories, is his theory  on Immortality. Which actually makes sense!<br /><br />After all the bad things I said about this book I would still highly recommend to anyone that they buy it.	2005-01-29

There are also some photos in the book of ancient objects that were found, that the modern world cannot yet recreate.<br /><br />The only thing that could have been better about this book was the quality of the photos is not very good, and I would have liked to see more photo's also.	2005-01-18

I would have rated this book 5 stars except for one thing, it has practically nothing on Hyperthyroidism. If your dealing with Hyperthyroidism (Graves Disease), then forget about this book and do a search on amazon for books on Graves Disease.<br /><br />If you are experiencing Hypothyroidism or even think you are because of being plagued with chronic illnesses that doctors cannot seem to diagnose, then this book just might be a godsend to you.<br /><br />Based on years of research from the authors private practice, this book offers a perfect balance of Western and Eastern medicine. The author takes a holistic approach to hypothyroidism, in not only showing you what medication works, but what herbs and natural products work, what mental and emotional healing may need to take place, proper diet, and human energy field work.<br /><br />After studying this book, you will probably be more educated on up to date thyroid treatment than your family doctor.	2005-01-01

Wondered why some things that you are taught in Church just don't make sense? Fasten your seat belts and get prepared for one of the most eye opening, life changing reads you may ever encounter.<br /><br />As most of the world moves into the Post-Modern era, people are loosing their trust in science and turning to spirituality for fulfillment. The author explains why the Post-Modern population is starting to loose interest in the neatly packaged Modern version of Christianity. It shows the reader what the Bible is really about, and lots of other reasons why the Modern Church is fast failing in a Post Modern world. All 'Christians' need to read this book and learn how to integrate the ideas presented into their own lives, if they want to continue having a strong faith and being a strong witness.<br /><br />After reading this book, you will probably find yourself thinking, \\"Wow, he answered all these questions that I had inside my head, but just couldn't put into words\\".<br /><br />This book has come along just at the right time in History. If the Modern Church does not start changing, it will definitely fail, as we can already see happening all around us.

I bought this book to help give me some better ideas on how to build a small as house as possible, while still keeping it livable. This book does show some good examples for small houses. It also adds in houses that are up to 1,291 sq/ft, which for most people is not a mini house, in fact it would be classed as a normal size house. As I said it did give a few examples that I could imagine living in, but lots of the homes pictured, look cold and lifeless.<br /><br />Also, there are not enough photos of each house to give you an idea what it would feel like to be in. And lots of the photos show the interiors as completely barren looking, as if no one actually lived in them!<br /><br />Get it from your library first before you decide to buy. I won't be adding this book to my listmania list.	2004-12-22

This 'new' addition has very few updates compared to the third. It feels like it's written by someone working strictly with Western Medicine, even though it does give a person direction to some Natural treatments for the listed ailments. Also the book does not go too deeply into describing any vitamin or mineral.<br /><br />On the positive side, the Table of Food Composition is nice to use, even though it is incomplete.

As far as I can tell it is the only book of it's kind out there. I would have given this book 5-Stars if it was made more like a coffee-table book; a bit larger, lots of glossy photo's and more interior photos of modern A-Frames.

Based on the 10 most important building patterns from the book \\"A Pattern Language\\", by Christopher Alexander (the book every architect should memorize) your expectations just don't seem to get met with this book. There are lots of good photos and lots of well designed houses, but you keep waiting for something to pop out at you when you are reading it, but it just doesn't happen. When reading the book \\"A Pattern Language\\" the small simple illustrations let your imagination flow, whereas in this book, the photo's of finished homes seem to shut off your own creative juices. Also the homes are mostly all huge and expensive. Good for architects designing mansions, but making you wonder how the patterns would have looked in a smaller home.<br />Since not everyone thinks alike, I am sure some people will get allot more out of this book than I have. And if this is your type of book then I think \\"The Not So Big House\\" series of books by \\"Sara Susanka are much better. Also if you have not read \\"A Pattern Language\\", by Christopher Alexander please do before you read any other architecture books.	2004-04-06

So you may end up wanting to buy a few other books (which there are lots of good ones) to satisfy your curiosity. Non the less, this book does give you a good example of American and some Canadian Bungalow history, also it explores each room of the Bungalow and the rooms furnishings, all with quite a few excellent photo's.	2004-04-06

The author writes with a sense of humour, so it is quite a pleasant read.<br />The many causes of snoring are shown and why they happen and how they might be corrected.<br />The physically and emotionally destructive side of snoring is shown and ways of dealing with them are discussed.<br />You will be shown all kinds of gadgets that are/where supposed to stop snoring and exercises that can help stop snoring.<br />You will also learn about medical procedures that may help you stop snoring. And how to select the proper physician.<br />Quite a helpful book if you haven't read about snoring before. I believe there are newer books out on this subject by the same<br />author.	2004-03-30

This book offers a good introduction into building with earth, straw and recycled materials. There are lots of nice photos with a brief story telling how and why the builders used the chosen materials.<br />This book does not go into depth on how to make a home out of straw bale, adobe, rammed earth or any other techniques. There are lots of other good books that do though.<br />I am kind of disappointed in a couple of the things the author says that are a bit misleading or untrue, probably unintentionally, but non the less they are there and you will not pick them out unless you are well read on alternative building techniques.	2004-03-29

This book does have enough pictures of built in cabinets/furniture from every room in the house to give you an idea of what can be done, but I found that other books I have read, such as Kitchen Design books, have way more information on certain topics than this book is able to cover. There is also some instructions on how to make some of the cabinets yourself. The style is all North American which is ok, but you should also read some books on how the Japanese design built in furniture, such as, Small Spaces: Stylish Ideas for Making More of Less in the Home, by Azby Brown.	2004-03-28

If you `enjoy' reading about all the different conspiracy theories that govern this world, then you will find this to be quite an enlightening read as Icke weaves all the different conspiracy theories together in a very easy to understand, well researched book, as frightening as it may be at times. His writing style is quite honest and open, and at times you may find it even a bit crude for your taste. His sources of information are easy to find at the end of each chapter, with a good bibliography and index at the end of the book.<br />This book will leave you feeling hopeless and sick at times, due to the depth he goes to show the deceit in the people that govern this world. No matter where you are in life or what you believe, this book will definitely make you re-examine yourself and the world around you with a much different outlook. Icke does offer some solutions to the world's problems but not as in depth as I would have liked to see.<br />His research exposes how governments, religions, media, and UFO's all blend together in a Matrix of deceit, that is ruled by a very small percentage of the worlds population, which is fast turning us (or already has) into a Orwellian society that we thought could never happen, to us the free.<br />This book is probably the best there is on bringing all conspiracy theories together, but as any book it is not the final word on any subject. If you're a well read person with an open mind you will find that a few of his theories still need a bit of work, but otherwise I would highly recommend that everyone read this book no matter how much it may go against what they believe is the truth.<br />As the book states, our inability to question our own motives or anyone else's is truly alarming, so I think a word of caution is needed, because lots of the information in the book is theories which never can become real to you unless you do what is needed to prove them to yourself.<br />Enjoy the book.

Having grown up believing that in hypnosis you give up your free agency and self-will to demonic control, and also hypnosis just being used for silly stuff, like having you act like a monkey or chicken on stage, I was quite leery about reading this book.<br />Now, after having read this book my understanding of hypnosis has been completely redefined. I now understand that we all put ourselves and other people through different forms of hypnosis every day. Praising or putting down your children, solemn prayer, day dreaming, deep thought, engrossed in a movie, television show or book are forms of hypnosis that we apply to our daily lives.<br />Also the only person who has the power and authority to hypnotize you, is you. All hypnosis is technically self-hypnosis. A person should be careful though because like all things that seem harmless, there is always someone out there using it for no good. Hypnosis can also be used for no-good. And then so can solemn prayer, watching movies, reading books, etc., have harmful effects on your conscious and unconscious mind.<br />It is our unconscious mind that effects what we can or cannot accomplish. We can learn to utilize our unconscious minds stored experiences through different forms of hypnosis to achieve our goals and utilize our abilities and potentials that are already stored within us.<br />Understand why autosuggestion, such as a New Years Resolution, does not work.<br />Learn how to explore and access your unconscious mind where everything we have ever seen or experienced is accurately stored.<br />Throughout this book you will learn the history of hypnosis, the theories behind it, how to learn, unlearn and relearn such things as sports, self control, smoking, stress, fear, pain, and being over-weight.<br />The only thing that I didn't like about this book is the poor typesetting and poor sound quality of the cassette recording. Overall though, an excellent, easy to read book for anyone interested in how the mind works. And exercises on how to apply the theories to your own mind.And exercises on how to apply the theories to your own mind.	2004-02-25

If you want a comparison to what Dyson's work looks like, then I would have to compare it to Bart Prince's work.<br />This book was written 10 years ago (1993), and shows less than seven percent of Dyson's work that had been built. It is a catalog from an exhibition of his first solo museum exhibition.<br />I am not sure how to rate it, being it is a 'catalog', so I am rating it as I would a normal book. The photography is not very good, and it also leaves you wanting more views of certain buildings. Also some of the writing is repetitious since there is first an essay and then further on in the book a list of projects that have lots of the same stories. The layout is also not very well done since two write ups on homes will be on one page and then the pictures will be on the next two!<br />Anyhow, there is allot of great architecture in this book, along with lots of beautiful illustrations of Dyson's work done by him and other artists. This is the only book on Arthur Dyson so far, so if your curious either get it from the library, buy it or wait until someone else publishes a newer book on his work.	2004-02-14

You will be given a quick history lesson on it's earliest beginnings and also a bit of history on all the most famous alchemists.<br />PART II deals with the theoretical aspect of alchemy, and the nice part about it is that it is not written in gibberish but plain english so anyone can follow with what is being said.<br />PART III is about the use of metals in medicine and other practical uses of alchemy. Plus you get to read extracts from 'The Golden Tractate' and 'The Revelation of Hermes'.<br />I found this book quite helpful in trying to understand the meaning of alchemy and the way to go about it since it was written by a practicing alchemist in plain english.	2004-01-28

If your interested in the history of the Bungalow style, and what makes a house a bungalow, or if your trying to figure out who designed your bungalow then this book will be worth while reading for you. Also if your interested in building your own bungalow or remodeling an existing one, this book should be quite helpful. The downside of this book is that it looks like it was published 50 years ago even though it was published in 2001! There are a few excellent photo's, some good ones, and a bunch of computer illustrations and other images that look like they are paintings or something that has been done with a cheap digital camera and a xerox machine! Not exactly a Coffee Table book. Also it does not go into great depth on any of the subjects, but then again I did not expect it to in the first place. If you want books that go into certain chapters/subjects in greater depth then buy ones that strictly talk about remodeling or ones that only talk about Greene and Greene or Arts &amp; Crafts homes.	2004-01-24

I found that this book gets to the point really quickly, maybe a bit to quickly! The author seems to cover every aspect of remote viewing but the instructions seemed a bit to rushed for me. The book did not dive into the science of remote viewing, so unless you have read lots about the human bioplasmic body, such as books on chakras and auras, you may not get as much out of the book as you could have. Also some of the stories are repetitious. Not a very well edited book. But it does seem to cover a bit of everything pertaining to remote viewing, and has lots of how to instructions, quick as they are. If the author ever writes an updated version of this book I hope he gets himself a good editor who could make this book more readable and usable, then he will get 5 stars from me.	2004-01-11

The author seems to be mixing a bit of New Age and Christianity together. The book does have some interesting theories that I have not read anywhere else before. To bad it was all out of one chapter!

I bought this book over 10 years ago, tried reading it, got turned off and stuck it under my bed. Lately having a lack of things to do, I dug this book out again to see if all my reading since then has effected my view on things enough to make this book more enjoyable. After having read less than half of this book, again, I have to say that I am going to use it to help start a fire in the shop tomorrow. If you go to the companies web site at ,[...] you will find lots of negative reviews. Very angry and hateful reviews to be exact. I don't blame them for reacting the way they did because the book is filled with flaws, contradictions, deceit, anger, hatred and just misinformation. There are so many examples that I am not even going to try and start writing them down. The author seems to be very misinformed about certain subjects. And others that he is informed about he puts his twisted way of thinking into them which makes them unbearable to read. I don't understand how people can grab onto something like this and let it guide their lives. I guess that is how people get involved with cults.

It also shows you the way he uses his module system for designing them. The things I didn't like about this book is that the photo's of some of the finished interiors looked quite bland and cheap compared to the renderings. Also most of the houses are not designed for families with more than 1 or 2 kids. Lots of the houses where designed for earth berming or underground, and most of them are designed for huge lots with hills to build into. In the real world we have small flat lots. I would like to see a book on how to build an attractive underground house into a real world lot that would be big enough for 4 kids. There is some really nice architecture in this book though.	2003-04-26

I am disappointed that certain architects where left out of this book, for example there was one photo of a Malcolm Wells house, but no essay was done on him!? An essay on earthships would have fit into this book nicely also. I could go on, and on about all the Green Architects that where left out, maybe the author will include more with a new version 10 years from now. You need to be careful that you question all that the author tells you. For example the author seems convinced that Christians are bent on destruction because of their belief that the earth was made for them, therefore they have the right to destroy it, but in reality the Christian's point of view is just the opposite in that the earth was made for them so therefore it is their duty to protect it. What's with the photo taken in B.C. Canada, I never knew there where palm trees in Canada!? I bought this book for some of it's photos of unusual looking buildings, but have discovered there is allot more to the book than photo's. Read it, enjoy it, question it, question yourself.	2003-01-05

There was a lot of stuff in this book I didn't need to read, but I suppose it would help out other people. I just got it for the last 5 pages! Take what you need out of it and ignore what you don't. It is a reference book, and it is up to you to decide if you can use it, and how to use it. Personally I prefer Candlesticks, and got a lot more out of the book \\"Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques\\" by Steve Nison, which is not for everyone, but depends on what type of trading you are doing.	2002-12-14

Interesting book that shows dozens of ways to make shelters in the wilderness.

If I had the money I would love to have a garage like most of the ones shown in the book. Well there are actually quite a few cheaper ones, and the book does give a person quite a few ideas what a garage can be made into or used for. The only thing I didn't like about the book is that it doesn't get into the really nitty gritty construction type stuff, telling you exactally how to build certain things. Then again maybe it was a good idea to exclude that kind of stuff. If you are looking for a book on how to build for small spaces buy the book Small Spaces: Stylish Ideas for Making More of Less in the Home by Azby Brown, which shows how the Japanese make use of every inch (cm) of space.	2002-12-11
