They do not only suffer from the physical effects of war but more so on the debilitating suppression on womanhood brought about by culture & religion.  Putting a name & face to these numerous victims we often hear about brings their woes closer to heart.  It makes me realize how much we take for granted simple things we enjoy in life that would equate to a beating or degradation to their kind.  <br />I admire what Zoya & RAWA is doing for the Afghan women.  I wish them more power & success in their endeavors.	2003-09-19

They accumulate over time building momentum until an invicible hand unleashes time's work &amp; changes everyone's lives.  Unfortunate lives which seemed to have already been written down in History, predetermined by fate &amp; brought to a denouement by the actions of two people who dared cross the boundary set by society. The caste system like law dictates who should be loved, how &amp; how much.<br />I felt like being led by Roy in a time machine, visiting the Kochama's in different time frames, giving an insight on why they have become what they were.  Baby with her unrequited Mulligan love life, Mamachi with her Papachi-caused moon craters in her head, Chacko losing a daughter holding a thimble for luck, Margaret living in a Joe-less &amp; Sophie Mol-less universe, Ammu searching for tranquility beyond her Ayemenem river, &amp; the fraternal twins constantly seeking acceptance, approval &amp; love - Rahel in her Love-in-tokyo fountainhead &amp; Esta in his beige pointed Elvis shoes.  The Kochama's grieving, scheming with &amp; against each other...all victims of their own fates.<br />The manner the story has been told (present-past-present-past)combined with its unique choice of words (Ammu told Rahel to stop it &amp; so she stoppited) enhanced the story's plot &amp; overall character.  I am certain Roy's poignant novel will touch everone's heart as it did mine.	2003-09-16

But albeit it being a fiction, it provided an insight to the past (&amp; maybe still present to this very day for some) of Moslem women where life was strictly governed by a patriarchal society &amp; the Koran.  In a way, the Virgin's Knot is similar to Paolo Coehlle's the Alchemist, due to Santiago &amp; Nurdane's constant search for truth &amp; happiness.  Unfortunately, Nurdane did not share Santiago's good fortune.  Despite her questioning &amp; being able to know the truth, her years of suppression &amp; submission made her fail to believe and accept in what she finally discovered.  Hence, the abrupt &amp; tragic ending.<br />All in all, the Virgin's Knot is worth reading - if not for its exquisite plot - then, at least for the insight it offers on a unique society.	2003-09-12

But it's just the beginning to a long (8 yrs.) healing process for a girl named Susie (whose bones have been literally broken), her family (who suffered from broken familial ties after her death) &amp; some friends/relatives/neighbors (who are involved with the Salmon family &amp; affected by their sufferings).  Like bones, they are all connected with one another, with Susie serving as 'joints' to hold them together.  Like limbs, each character moves independently, only to realize later on that his/her actions is part of a bigger body.  Like a disease, grief rots the bones &amp; destroys its connectivity.  But like blood, love washes over them, brings hope &amp; heals.  Susie, Lindsey, Buck, Jack, Abbie --- broken in their own way --- healed by time &amp; love for one another --- lovely.	2003-09-10

The variations &amp; functions were concisely described without losing the reader into the technical &amp; miniscule details. But this was just icing to the cake.  The real serving was Bob the Nailer...his strength, his vulnerability, his unwavering faith to justice &amp; the institution that embodies it.

Chiyo, later known as Sayuri, led a life full of sadness, hardship, discipline, perseverance &amp; determination.  One thing that made Sayuri unique from the other geishas was her brighter disposition amidst the loneliness her culture brought &amp; the events that have transpired during that time.  For although Sayuri obeyed &amp; accepted life &amp; its consequences, as was expected of women that time, she never lost hope &amp; focus in attaining her dreams.  <br />This novel also gives us a glimpse of Japan's unique &amp; artistic culture.  A glimpse, because it is like taking a peek behind a thick curtain, &amp; finding that what lies behind is different, interesting &amp; causes you to desire, to know &amp; see more.	2003-08-05

As most sequels (novels, movies) tend to become bland & boring, I noticed that JK's novels are the exceptions to the rule.  Hers improve everytime, & 'The Order of the Phoenix' is the best of the 5-series, so far.  I expect that the 6th & the 7th (the last, oh no!) would even be better.<br />Gone are the pre-teen days of our characters & gone is the distinction between Muggle world & wizard world, as JK wrote this 5th novel in a different, darker, more matured approach.  The tension, confusion & mixture of Harry's 2 worlds blend in a richer tone & yet a more beguiling read.  Harry's life no longer revolves on quidditch (although we all know how much he longed for his Firebolt) but took a more matured turn with the foundation of the secret organization, with him being the head.<br />The story has an 'open-ended' ending, preparing the readers for an 'open' & 'all-out-war' against the Dark Lord & his followers on the last remaining installments.  & if Book 5 has kept you reading for hours, I anticipate Books 6 & 7 would command as much (if not more) attention.<br />I am looking forward to the next installments.

However, just like everyone else, their satisfaction &amp; happiness rely on their sense of completeness (to be depended upon &amp; needed once again) &amp; yes, to be loved.  This book takes a look at what the elders (have to)do to cover those long barren hours in their twilight years..often drowning in senile depression should they fail to find something worthy of their time &amp; attention.  However, it was presented in a funny way --- what with Mrs. Washington playing an over-aged 'Cupid' to two elder lovey-dovies, &amp; later on becoming a victim of 'granny romance' in the end.  Mr. Horowitz' rich blend of characters is just as lovable as well.	2003-07-14

It was interesting to note though the effects of mergers/buyouts on the healthcare sector &amp; the resuting power struggle within by remaining staff against 'new management'.  How it affected their service &amp; how the patients suffered from such 'politics'.  That is very real.  <br />What I found quite unrealistic was Kim's decision to work underground in the slaughter house with the intention of obtaining some important papers as evidence of QC failure.  This may be an act of desparation but which I found quite out of line for the character.<br />In general, the book was a good weekend read.

Archer's short stories, The Eleventh Commandment is my first novel.  Hence, I do not have any basis of comparison vs. his past novels, which most readers say are a lot better.  Regardless of that observation, I have found this book very enjoyable.  The opening scene has caught my attention & the subsequent events are definite page-turners. I agree that the story takes you for a (roller coaster) ride from one country to another & the events may be quite surreal.  But what is specifically there which is not believable?  For someone who has not worked with the secret service, much more with the NCOs, Connor's every movement is livid & brings us closer to feeling his dilemma.  My only negative comment though is on how Mr. Archer portrayed Connor's character...a seemingly flawless person.  But overlooking this shortcoming, The Eleventh Commandment is a very enjoyable read.	2002-11-05

Afterall, the description of Wall Street operations is almost real if not exact.  The conspiracy & the Pleiade Project may be surreal but we have an idea how powerful people work & conspire against their enemies.<br />Everyone has a shady history, Andrew Falcon inlcuded.  The problem is everyone else's story is accounted for, except Andrew Falcon.  Here is a guy who is so smart, becomes a partner of a high profile investment company, heading the M&A department. He also graduates from Harvard like the rest.  BUT the history check ends there.  Nothing is said about his past prior to the Harvard days...except that Andrew is also street smart & able to fight a G-man & his hitman at the former's turf.  Now, how convenient & what a combination of skills.  It may be the author's style to keep Andrew as mysterious as possible.  But after reading the book from cover to cover, I could have been humored by a brief paragraph about his real background & how he managed to go to the authorities without implicating himself (which is another loophole in this book).<br />In any case, The Takeover was an enjoyable read during an idle day.  It could have been made better, but it was ok.	2002-10-25

I haven't heard about this collection until my friend accidentally left hers in my house.  Anticipating a lousy cartoon strip compilation, I was pleasantly surprised that it was very interesting & hilarious.  As an adult, it gave me an overview of how a child's mind works.  I have forgotten how imaginative & creative a child could be & realized how repressive I have been acting towards my daughter, just like Calvin's parents. <br />We all have been like Calvin in our earlier lives.  We had a Hobbes as a best friend, a Susie whom we loved to annoy but loved as well, a transmogrifier & a babysitter who scared the hell out of us.  We daydreamed in class, we played 'pretend' & lived life to the fullest.  <br />It is so refreshing to witness such naivity once again.  & though adult lives have robbed us of our youthful innocence, Calvin & Hobbes takes us back to those pure, clean fun days in a child's life.	2002-10-01

But instead of sounding feminist, bitter & pathetic, our heroines are funny & witty despite their intense desire to seek revenge...nay justice.  The book dealt on how Elise, Brenda & Annie formed the First Wives Club, how they connived to mete out punishments to erring husbands & how they discovered their own identities & happiness along the way.<br />Despite having a more serious tone compared with its movie version, Goldsmith's book is funnier & revenge tastes sweeter.

Here we witness the various forms of marriage...those out of comfort, convenience & love.  It might have been too wild with all of Rannaldinni's promiscuity & scandalous sex practices (oh morality, whert have thou gone?)but the writer tempered the scenes with humor so as not to totally appall the readers.<br />Some scenes were sort of weird especially that of Rannaldini's well-planned & well-executed Othello party (but of course, what do you expect of that devil!) & a bit too long for Lysander & Kitty to finally stage a courageous happy ending.  But overall, it's a funny read & highly entertaining.  You can't help but curse some characters but fall for others.<br />P.S.  Meredith... is superbly witty & funny :)	2002-09-17

Yes, I laughed more than cried despite the sad plight of our protagonist in his battle to survive a new life -- wifeless, bringing up his son alone, seeing his father die, etc. etc.  Just like the way we would have laughed on our own silliness or errors upon looking back (assuming we have reached a triumphant stage at the end).<br />When I first read the title, \\"A man & a boy\\", I initially concluded it would be about our lead character & his son.  But upon reading it, it could have been several things afterall...Him (man) & his son (boy), him (boy) & his father (man), & lastly, him & himself both as man & boy.  <br />I learned that being a real man isn't measured simply by your success or what kind of car you drive, or how many women you have laid.  It is about living life & finding its true meaning.  The problems we have experienced & overcome mold us to a certain character; & what we do with our selves & our lives give the true meaning to our existence.	2002-04-26

For those who are about to read the book---well, what happened was really unimaginable!<br />Similar to the The Street Lawyer, this lawyer-story has minimal courtroom scenes & centered on one's morality & faith.  However, what rendered The Testament more believable was Nate's struggle to overcome his weaknesses & fears. & although his life was converted (in some sort of way), it was not too outlandish (i.e. living in the Brazilian jungles.

This seemingly short book about a group of boys marooned in an island has more to it than simple adventures.  It does not only shows how each boy (of varying ages) responds to his predicament, but also deals with man's nature & the society through symbolisms.<br />It is inate in us to differentiate good & evil, & this characteristic is further strengthened by the society's norms.  Ralph represents our logical side which is continuously governed by reason (\\"Piggy\\").  Both Ralph & Piggy embody our continuous search for civilization & order.  However, also inate in us, is a brewing desire to do what we really want, no matter how unjustly or incorrect it is.  Jack portrays this aggressive behavior.<br />In an ideal environment, it is common for men to have desires but these can only be manifested & carried it out if they comply with society's set rules.  However, this is not the usual case.  The catastrophe faced by the boys only magnifies society's imperfections.  These ills cannot be easily cured on a superficial level.  The success or breakdown in society can all be traced to man's inner stability.	2002-01-24

Sad to say, although Sophie's World is very rich with the philosophic ideas, it lacked on characteristics of being a good novel.  It seemed to me to be more of a book on philosophy instead of a novel (or maybe, it really is intended as a philosophy book). I feel like taking a course on philosophy, which is actually interesting though.  However, the characters were not given enough depth e.g. Sophie, Albert, Hilde, or even the dog Hermes.  Their appearances were merely to break the monotonous lecture about the different philosophers, their ideas &amp; their projects.  <br />If you are highly interested on the topic of philosophy, you might enjoy reading this book, as it summarizes the evolution of philosophy throughout the ages, compressing it in approx. 400 pages.

Except for a few stories, they were simply a few pages off.  I also consider the uniqueness/strangeness of both the plot &amp; setting quite interesting &amp; noteworthy.  I somewhow relate this book to one of Edgar Allan Poe's short story collections, although Roald Dahl's book has a different style &amp; a touch of (black) humor.<br />There were approx. 4 stories which really caught my attention &amp; they were that of the meek (as a lamb) wife pulling off a successful crime, a surviving brain, a royal-jelly product baby &amp; the reincarnated Lintz &amp; Edward the Conqueror.<br />However, there were several stories about gambling which I particularly were not fond off.  I couldn't see the humor in it --- instead, I felt something of a &quot;GOOD FOR YOU&quot; attitude.<br />I guess it all boils down to taste &amp; preference.  I wouldn't mind trying another of his pieces though.  I am optimistic that I will find another book by this author which I will truly like.	2001-11-26

Not till I read this book, a deck of cards to me was simply a deck of cards --- something to play with either alone or with friends.  After having read this book, I now hold a very much different opinion.<br />The world, &amp; life in general, are like the entire deck of cards. It is full of different people, belonging in different families. Year in &amp; year out, these people dwell with their own lives.  Nothing concerns them more than their immediate environment. Like the dwarves in the magical island, we tend to run from the truth.  Yes, we search...but if we feel we will not like the truth we are unearthing, then we avoid finding it out entirely. Like these suits, we humans, are oblivious &amp; indifferent to the wonders that surround us.  Like the Ace of Hearts, we are in constant search of something that we do not know of, &amp; more often than not, we tend to lose ourselves.  Like the Kings, we judge the Joker negatively, not only for how he looks, but for what he sees &amp; says are very much different from our own views.  Needless to say, it is this odd man who is the wisest of us all.  He, being an outsider, gets to observe properly &amp; sees the mire we are all in.  <br />In general, this book is a very interesting &amp; unique piece.  It is a far cry from the usual commercial books we often see around.  I highly recommend this book to every avid reader, despite the main character (Hans) being a child.   The topics being discussed through the pages are interesting to note &amp; very much worthy of our thoughts.  It is something to read &amp; ponder on.<br />&amp; oh yes, before I forget...nothing is permanent in this world.  Only change &amp; time.	2001-11-26

Rowlings has outdone herself again.  Though the Harry Potter series is rated as a children's book, Book 4 is definitely for older &amp; more matured readers.<br />Goodbye to sissy plots &amp; school adventures, the story is taken to a higher &amp; newer heights.  Looking past the wizardry &amp; magic, the theme is all the more realistic &amp; very much adult in approach.<br />Children might find this book too 'dark' as it is full of hatred, revenge, fear, treachery, greed, jealousy, cheating, guilt, gossip (media, oh media!), pride, gambling, blackmail, attachment to power, vanity, &amp; yes, DEATH..  Not really for young audience to comprehend nor appreciate.<br />Fret not, though, for it has its redeeming qualities as well.  To fight evil in every nooks &amp; corners, we have strong moral core composed of love, justice, true friendship, loyalty, honesty, equality, trust, decency, responsibility, sportmanship, alliance &amp; fareness.<br />Truly a cliffhanger! Unlike the previous HP books, you do not get here the normal light &amp; relieved feeling after reading till the end.  On the contrary,you have this heavy burden on your chest knowing that the the greatest enemy is back &amp; more powerful &amp; that the end of this book is just the beginning of a more exciting, more grueling series ahead.<br />Harry Potter has matured a lot in this book.  &amp; so has its author, J.K. Rowling.<br />Of all the HP series so far, (#1 - 4), this book is highly recommended for reading &amp; worth collecting.  I cannot wait till the next one.<br />J.K.

Dumbledore is always away when the &quot;big&quot; thing happens leaving Harry to deal with it by himself.  Of course, we know he comes back in time to rescue Harry.  There is also always a suspicious character who may not necessarily be the antagonist.  &amp; most importantly, the lesson we all love ... good triumphs over evil.<br />I agree though that it is highly entertaining.  It has a touch of suspense (Oh, what's going to Harry next?), mystery (Who is doing all those nasty things?) &amp; humor (like what happened to Hermoine in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom).  It is also filled with good stuff for the young (&amp; old) minds about loyalty, bravery, friendship, pure-heartedness &amp; yes, the importance of CHOICE!

Then, there were the Internet warnings saying that since Harry Potter did not mention in any of its series about God, then it must be the work of the other side.  Well, years after, I finally decided to take a look at it &amp; decide if it would be a safe read for my children.  &amp; here is what I have to say:<br />(1)  It is an easy read.  Kids age 9 &amp; above will comprehend the plot &amp; the underlying lessons of good &amp; evil.  Surprisingly, as an adult, I found it entertaining as well, &amp; couldn't put the book down.  It took me only a day to finish this &amp; I immediatly moved on to the next of its series.<br />(2)  As for the critics, I would say that this book is a welcome change in the very commercialized novel industry where the books' plots are almost geared to being made to movies (although, by now, a HP movie is already about to be released).  It has a different setting, a different kind of characters &amp; therefore a different plot.  However, it is no much different from the mugles' (ours) world as good continually battles evil &amp; as we would wish, good always triumphs at the end.  &amp; in this light, I would say, if good always prevails, then, there's Divine intervention, &amp; if that's the case, then, this couldn't be the work of the 'dark side.'<br />(3)  I admired the way Rowlings created her characters --- full of imperfections.  That way, not one single character overshadows the rest.  Not even Harry, who we know is far from being muscles nor brain.  In defeating his nemesis, he needed the help of his friends, who ont heir own, would not have succeeded either.<br />(4)  A little predictable but entertaining.<br />I am giving it 5 stars not because I am a fan of Harry Potter but I believe this (&amp; its sequels) would be a good read for my children, given the above reasons.	2001-10-10

Light, because at a glance, the tales seemed shallow &amp; the stories dealt on eroticism.<br />But despite the humor, the comicness &amp; the absurdity in which each character is cloaked in, one will realize that the author was leading the readers to a man's real state of mind --- his obsession with sex &amp; self worth, self satisfaction &amp; contentment, all intertwined.  Yes, man's ego - at his best or worst - which can then lead to either his downfall or redemption.<br />At a glance, this may be mistaken by the feminist groups to be glorifying men's sexual conquests --- at the expense of the hapless female characters.  But at a closer look, one would also recognize the author's equal ability to draw out truthfully a woman's bing &amp; state of mind through his excellent narration.  <br />Of the 7 short stories, I found 3 very relevant &amp; touching.  Yes, the humor &amp; the light-mannered narration were still present but they reeked too much of reality --- too close for comfort.  If I were to rate my choices in order, I would rank &quot;The Hitchiker's Game&quot; as #1, &quot;Edward &amp; God&quot; as #2 &amp; &quot;Let the Old Dead make froom for the Young Dead&quot; as #3.<br />In an industry where commercialism (what with all these movie tie-ins)&amp; plot predictability, Milan Kundea &amp; his books are a welcome change.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been searching for something new, something different, soemthing meaningful &amp; something intellectual.	2001-09-06

Consequently, we have to  note though the underlying theme of lowe's infinity.  For Sarah, it is herlove for her son which drove her to transcend the boundaries of time to seek revenge.

The major action only took place in the 1st few pages when a kid drowned accidentally in the pond.  After that, the following chapters just crawled &amp; slithered, &amp; I have been tempted many times to put it down &amp; leave it unfinished.<br />After being able to read it through (finally), it was a relief to know that it was not a waste of time afterall.  Alice was a character you have to understand.  She's not the typical predictable, one-dimensioned, character often portrayed in easy-to-read books.  She was multi-faceted &amp; only reading the book through would allow the reader to get into Alice's deepest core &amp; learn to understand, &amp; yes, accept her as one of us in this ill society.<br />After reading Alice's first chapters bearing her chaotic mind, then Howard's chapters on self preservation, then back to Alice's chapters on acceptance &amp; survival, I couldn't help but admire this fictional character.  She may not be the heroine we would normally look up to (considering her own personal flaws), but we, especially the women, can learn fromher mistakes &amp; draw strength from her character.	2001-08-16

I chose the unabridged version!  Despite knowing the story by heart, I am surprised to discover the complexity of an unabridged version.  My being unfamiliar with the French history was even more to my disadvantage.  Only my obsession with the story drove me to finish the thick book.  Despite its reading difficulty &amp; complexity levels, I didn't find it a disappointment though.  It just opened my eyes more to the social illnesses suffered by Jean Valjean, Fantine  et al &amp; consumed me even more - both mentally &amp; emotionally. I recommend everyone to read this.

Maybe because I could empathize more with the female character of both Ruth &amp; her estranged mother, Marion.  <br />It breaks my heart to think how difficult it would have been for a 4 yr.old child to grow in a house with a family which has ceased to be one, long before she was born; &amp; to live in the shadows of her dead brothers, living in the world of photographs - reliving each day their happy moments (which she never had) &amp; memorizing the stories behind each picture by heart.  I also find it would have been incomprehensible for such a young mind to be abandoned by her mother.  &amp; being a mother myself, I couldn't imagine how excruciatingly painful it was for Marion to lose both sons in an accident &amp; live with its grief for the rest of your life.  <br />I commend John Irving for the very detailed storytelling he has done - once again.  The details shown on each page transported me to Ruth's world &amp; enabled me to join her continous pursuit for her own survival &amp; happiness &amp; her observance &amp; sometimes involuntary witness of other people's search for their own happiness.<br />True, as Ted Cole had once said, life's test is that sometimes, there's no place to pull over --- sometimes you can't stop --- &amp; you just have to find a way to keep going.	2001-04-03

At age 14, I was fully aware what an incestuous relationship was, but I couldn't help but feel sorry for Chris &amp; Cathy &amp; wished them a happier life.<br />After this book, I became a V.C. Andrews fan &amp; read all sequels to this novel.  The subsequent books are not as great as the original but the last, which tells the end of it all, has history repeating itself...it still has the tragic elements of the &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; but it has a peaceful &amp; happy ending for all the surviving characters. <br />Also read the 'prequel' to this story which centers on the grandmother &amp; pretty much explains why she's so sinister in the &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;.	2000-10-09

Afer having read &quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot; 16 years ago, I became curious about &quot;My Sweet Audrina&quot;.  V.C. Andrews novels were quite popular in my class at that time, so I tried hard to avail a copy of this book.  I don't remember much of the novel since I read it 14 years ago but I do remember the numerous clocks in their house with varying time settings &amp; Audrina living a quite abnormal life.  Of course, these occurences were all linked to her past &amp; her ultimate secret.<br />Upto this day, everytime I see our household clocks carrying different time, I always remember My Sweet Audrina.	2000-10-09

Being the last of the series, I read it &amp; was surprised to find out that it was actually meant to be a prequel instead.  I only gave it a 3-star because it came in after a long series of the &quot;Flowers..&quot; &amp; following everything through became quite boring.  The only redeeming factor was that it was more of an introductory to the entire series &amp; it pretty much explained the reasons behind the 'Dresden dolls' suffering &amp; why a good-natured Olivia turned evil overnight.	2000-10-09

This is not the typical horror story which explains all the gruesome events nor is it a mystery/thriller which is simply a murder/psycho case.  It is something in between of each &amp; has even more to offer.<br />True, the plot seems so simple --the drive from Philly to SF, a madman stalking our protagonists.  However, I noticed that the readers are not spoonfed &amp; even enjoy room for their own thinking &amp; imagination.  We all know that Lelan was suffering from an intense migraine, but was there a sinister force behind that caused it &amp; made him think/act accordingly?  Likewise, was there some evil force spreading around which cause people (e.g. gasoline man, the hotel lady &amp; Capt. Ackridge) to act so envious &amp; indiffirenly towards others?  &amp; what about the last part when Alex mentioned he had lost something --- was that caused by the dark force moving around Leland or simply human nature?; &amp; will that change him for the rest of his life for better of for worse?<br />I agree there was a lot of loopholes in between &amp; some incontinuity of events but that only made the simple story more unpredictable.  &amp; though simple &amp; basic as it seems, it caters more to the imaginative mind.	2000-10-04

This is the case for both Patricia/Kerry &amp; yes, even Abigail Jennings.  For Patricia, it's her grandmother &amp; aunt/adoptive mom concealing the  truth about her parent's relationship. They have the most genuine concern  &amp; her interest at heart but hiding the truth &amp; telling something  otherwise hurts more. Likewise with Abigail, she may not be an angel nor a  saint but she believed (rather chose to believe) lies told to her by her  most trusted personnel &amp; that got her into deeper trouble. Again, Toby  did (&amp; earnestly believed) what he had to do for Abby's sake (&amp; his  as well) but the truest intention when coupled with the wrong means tends  to backfire. <br />I applaud the author's style of molding the characters in  the story. Not one individual was 100% evil nor saint. Even our antagonists  have a heart. They had the noblest intentions but just got lost somewhere  along the way. <br />This story also awakened a belief taught to me by my  mother when I was still a kid &amp; that is 'You'll never succeed if you  don't acknowledge where you came from'. Admit it, not everyone is born with  a silver spoon in his or her mouth. Most of the time, we have to claw our  way up. But we should always remember our past, our beginnings. We should  not deny &amp; hide it because we are afraid that we will not be accepted  by society if they come to know about our background. Instead, we should  make this our inspiration &amp; driving force. &amp; if we do succeed, the  more we should acknowledge it to set as an example to others who are still  trying to find their way up.	2000-09-18

Books	5	2	3	N	N	Parents� worst nightmare�	Being a mother myself, I clearly &amp; painfully understood what Nancy has undergone all through those years. Losing a child is totally  heartbreaking...much worse losing both children &amp; being suspected of  killing them yourself at the same time.  One will never outlive the guilt  that eats you inside, eternally blaming yourself for the loss of your loved  ones. Remember that no mother in her right mind will hurt her  children.<br />We should always open our eyes &amp; remember that there are  always bad people out there perpetually committing evil deeds.  There are  Carls out there who are sick-to-the-bone who do nasty things to their own  children.  There are also the Jed Coffins who because of their  self-righteousness do more harm than good - hastily judging people when  they are supposed to be seeking the truth &amp; protecting the innocents.   <br />We should always be aware of our surroundings &amp; be on the lookout.   Not all the time do we have a John Kragoppoulos who is willing to put  himself in danger for our own safety.   Nor do we always have the Keeneys  or the Wiggleys who have the presence of mind to raise small unusual items,  which could be substantial evidences after all.  Not all the time do we  have Michael's who are very alert &amp; responsible despite their young  age.<br />I am not surprised to learn that this novel is MHC's best ---  probably because it's her first.  But also, she is a talented writer who  perfectly creates her crafts no less.  `Where are the Children' is indeed a  very exciting, fast-paced story but also is very truthful about the social  illnesses &amp; conveys an important message of trust, love &amp; support.   I am very grateful to have a loving husband &amp; a lovely daughter...&amp;  am happy for Nancy who finally found peace &amp; bliss with Ray, Michael  &amp; Missy.	2000-09-18

Afterall, who would not be driven insane if you're starved, scared,  alone in a god-forseaken place.  But you have to hand it to SK who was able  to twirl the story &amp; took the readers along for a walk into the  woods...seeing what Trisha was seeing, hearing what she's hearing, feeling  what she's feeling. Also, I noticed that despite the usual SK trademark of  supernaturals (ghosts, apparitions, etc.), he seemed to point out that  there is only one True God --- whether it be in the woods or not, late  innings or not, baseball fan or no baseball fan --- if you truly believe  &amp; pray in Him, YOU'LL BE SAVED!	2000-08-29

I have had the privilege of both reading &amp; seeing the story on film  &amp; I have to say both mediums were perfectly crafted - the book well  written &amp; the film well created. What I liked most in the written form  was the continuous depiction of Richard's struggle through &quot;time&quot;  --- meaning, he was able to transcend it (or so he thought &amp; believed)  yet there was always the impending danger of being transported back, as  proven by his continuous dizzy spells &amp; blackouts (which by the way was  not developed in the film's plot).  In the film, it seemed so easy for  Richard to settle in the new era, albeit the lack of physical strength  (note that he was terminally ill in the &quot;future&quot;) &amp; the  &quot;culture&quot; shock or adjustment he had to do in order to fit in the  new society, norms, et al. What I preferred more though in the movie  version was the style/manner of Richard's returning to the  &quot;future&quot;.  I just found it more dramatic &amp; tragic that  Richard had to dissipate right before Elise's eyes. In the book's version,  he saw the penny while hiding from Robinson &amp; Elise still asleep.  If I  were Elise &amp; I woke up not finding Richard ever, I would still feel as  heartbroken as she was &amp; deemed his loss strange but not as mysterious  as seeing him uprooted before my very eyes.  Still, the immense experience  would have changed me overnight to a deeper, more mysterious, &amp; more  secluded individual. Overall, I have to say, Matheson is a great writer.  I  salute you!  He has this unique style of perfectly intertwining fantasy  &amp; romance yet subtly (&amp; significantly as well) injecting another  idea which will leave the reader to continually think &amp; wonder what he  truly meant &amp; how he truly intended to end the novel. Despite being a  classic novel, I see it as a good reading material in class as well.  It  can also generate a good discussion between groups if Richard really  travelledback in time or was he just deliriuos due to his condition &amp;  everything was just pure hallucination? In addition to this, they can also  discuss if time travel is indeed possible &amp; in what forms can this be  done.	2000-08-24

I saw the movie first &amp; my initial reaction was &quot;Ok,  cinematography was GREAT but plot is so depressing&quot;.  When I decided  to read the book, I discovered that there were a lot of areas not fully  expounded nor explained in the movie.

I am a Catholic &amp;  believe in Heaven &amp; Hell -- it is something we have been taught in  home, school &amp; church.  Similar to Matheson's story, there is LIFE  after DEATH.  It is living accordingly to HIS will &amp; reaping what you  sowed during your lifetime here on earth.   What's amazing to note is one  person's unflatering belief &amp; conviction to transcend boundaries of  spiritual locations to save his partner... &amp; in failure to do so, his  strong willingness to suffer altogether just to be one.

Chricton's 1st (but maybe one of his bests)novel was not merely a suspense/mystery story in a medical setting.

It dealt with social ills such as poor family binding, low or  absence of morality, addiction &amp; its consequences.  Also, there was the  highly debatable issue of abortion --- truly &quot;a case of need&quot;.   On the other side, he included the dilemma of a person bound by his own  profession's code of ethics in exchange for justice &amp; truth. No, the  story was not a simple scandal/murder setting.

In both stories, SK showed us his wide &amp; varying writing styles.  Readers will definitely tire of his stories if he compiles those with same plots &amp;  styles together.  Rage is patterned after Carrie -- almost too similar.   Characters, venue &amp; plot are continuation of the original  &quot;telekinetic&quot; novel.  As it was, it became too predictable.  With  the Running Man, it was quite different.  Here, SK gave us a glimpse of  what the future would be if dishonesty, greed &amp; poverty overtake the  world.  Our hero of course takes a strong hold at the center of the story -  an innocent being trapped in a &quot;greedy game&quot; where survival of  the fittest rules.

It was fast-paced &amp; full of action -- too full in fact, it is more apt for a movie.  I am not saying the story is unreal.  The genetic engineering side is plausible -- what with all the  developments &amp; advancements around us.  What is quite impossible is the  survival of our lead characters.  It was something like &quot;you &amp; me  against the world&quot; concept &amp; despite the deadly combination of  killers, CIA, well reknowned scientists, etc. the protagonists conquered  them all with merely &quot;scratch on the shoulder&quot;.   The writer  built suspense as the story progressed but I somehow got lost in connecting  the 3rd phase with the previous 2 test stages.  The first 2 seemed deadly  while the 3rd deemed to be otherwise. On a general note, it was okay.  If  you're looking for a real reading stuff, you may be a little disappointed  as this material proved to be more like Chricton's movie books.

The other was  too good to be true &amp; you might wonder what his role was, other than a  love triangle. For all it's worth, it was not really a waste of time.

From there, it took  on a much faster pace where our protagonists were adversely faced with  their 14th century opponents --- full of action &amp; heartstopping events.    Overall, it's an enjoyable read for adventure seekers.  True, it's like  Jurrassic Park, with a historical theme park background, but I say the  readers will not feel bored basically because of this characteristic.

The story is not really about &quot;Old  Sparky&quot; but more of Paul's mind travel to the past &amp; his re-living  all sweet &amp; bitter memories.  You'll weep &amp; laugh with him.  You'll  feel his pain, sorrow &amp; fear with every turn of the page.  You will  want &amp; pray with him for John's release or finding peace.  &amp; like  Paul &amp; John, you will agree that life is like a &quot;Green Mile&quot;  --- a walk to your end.	2000-03-02

Aside from asenseless plot of touring the reader from one Italian city to theother, Tom's characterization is nowhere near what I expected (based on what I have read from other viewers/readers).  He is nothing more than a scheming, envious, social climber, loser --- rather than a hero as others claim him to be.  Most importantly, I find it despicable for the author to come up with an ending such as the one in the book. Where has her moral &amp; social responsibilities gone?  I am not a fundamentalist nor a right-wing individiual, but by creating the ending, the author condones evil in the society instead of bringing up justice.	2000-02-15

Society, like the cider house, has rules set by people, rules supposedly followed obediently, rules that are guidelines to one's behavior &amp; decision making.  But society, like the people living in St. Clouds' &amp;  in Oceanview, tend to make their own rules in their daily lives --- not  necessarily in conformity with the society's norms but not necessarily  wrong either.  It only clearly shows that life is not entirely black or  white, right or wrong.  Somehow, somewhere, compromises are made to make  things right for some lost souls.	2000-01-31

The author is very cleverin making twists &amp; turns in the story that when you think you already discovered who's who, she introduces a new complication that will make you wonder again.I often  wake up at night (during the period that I was reading the book) &amp; my  mind will automatically wander to the characters &amp; try to determine who  is the mystery man &amp; who is the daughter, etc.etc.  I highly recommend  this book to al mystery lovers.	2000-01-11

It builds up the suspense &amp; though not really scary, I can't take it off my mind at night (especially at dark). I find the characters' reaction to the supernatural events sort of weird.  I  was expecting fear but they manifested more of excitement.  I don't know if  it was the author's intention to make the characters appear  &quot;possessed&quot; by the house's spirit or it was more of the  characters' breaking-up, automatic self defense to cover their fears &amp;  attempt to appear courageous at the spookiest event.  Overall, I enjoyed  the book but was quite disappointed at the climax.  I had to re-read to  make sure I got it right.  (I won't mention any further for the sake of  future readers).	2000-01-07
