Never in my imagination could I even conceive of some of the journals that Ms. Perrella showcases in this book.  I also own the book \\"The Decorated Page\\" and love that one as well.  But \\"Artist Journals\\" seems a little more welcoming in its explaination of how to create the journals shown in the book, as well as give you ideas on creating various other journals.<br /><br />I'm going online to check for art materials right now.  I cannot wait.  If you are looking to awaken your creative muse, purchase this book.  You will not be disappointed.	2004-09-22

The Honey Well was a novel that I enjoyed from beginning to end, and while some reviewers did not enjoy this story, (it is somewhat along the current negative books you read these days), because it is so well written it keeps you captivated.  You feel for Arnell, but wonder why she keeps letting her mother, Esther, completely dominiate and humiliate her.<br />Esther, the mother is a complex characther...classy yet vulgar, sweet yet sinister, you are captivated as to why and how she became the woman she is.  Unfortunately the ending is a bit dull and the explanation of how Esther's deciving ways came to be is never really explained completely.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed this book and will try to find more by this author.	2004-06-22

You feel the pain that her husband Eric has put her through, yet at the same time you get impaitient with her for staying with him that long.  When she finally does break free from her husband, you are allowed to see the transformation in Ruth, but at the same time you understand her vuneralbility and her hesitation in meeting Adrian.<br />I read this book in two days, I enjoyed it that much!	2004-04-05

A Love Noire tells the story of the \\"love\\" Between Innocent and Noire, two completely different up and coming buppies.  Noire is the bohemian one, Innocent, Noire's man is conservative.  Both have some serious issues, which never seem to come completely clear, but the have a bond that is strong.<br />I liked the book since it was written in an intelligent way, but sometimes i would wonder where Ms. Turnipseed was going with her characters.  I still do not understand where Noires' brief bi-sexual episode fits in the book (It's not like the Shug Avery/Celie bit in Color Purple--there was at least an explaination regarding that).  I also was somewhat annoyed with Noire, since she seemed to have too many hangups.  But all in all, I welcomed this book since it was more intelligent than some of the novels I think most writers seem to write these days.  I look forward to reading more by Ms. Turnipseed.	2004-03-10

What I will say is that this book is an easy read and you will be hooked from beginning to end reading it.

I am definitely going to suggest to my Black Studies teachers that they incorporate this book into their classrooms.  A.G. Gaston is the entreprenuers hero!  This is a story of an individual who could not and would not stay in the position society told him he was to adhere to.  His self determination and self reliance into forging a life and business for himself is enough to make anyone feel ashamed of themselves for suggesting that they cannot become an entreprenuer.

I think that every black woman could use this book; it simply reminds us that in a busy world, you must take care of yourself.  While the word Diva is overused, this book reminds you as a black woman, you must take care of your emotional, spiritual, sides as well as a fashion staple.  It also covers how one can entertain with grace, no matter what the situation.  I fell in love with this book from the moment I read the first chapter in the bookstore!	2004-02-02

Girl leaves home/has abusive home life/raped by uncle, father, father figure/cousin/dad/someone<br /><br />2. Winds up a stripper/ho/numbers runner/drug addict<br /><br />3.

Either ends up: dead/own business/getting away from her past life<br /><br />What bothered me about this book is that it was written in ebonics, so to follow it I felt like I was reading 21st century Paul Laurence Dunbar (If you have to ask, then you just don't know).  While the plot was surprisingly on track, I just felt like enough already, there has to be something else to read.<br /><br />I'm sure Mr. Holmes is writing about what he knows.  And I'm sure that these individuals have had hard times.  But to continue to read books like this only depresses me to the point of not wanting to support these authors for lack of originality.  There has to be a balance y'all.	2004-01-30

But he is not comfortable in his own skin and decides to adopt a more ethnic name to use in Harlem.  Mason transforms himself to &quot;Mallik&quot; and upon searching for a place to rent meets Carmen.<br />Carmen is from money herself and is also trying to escape part of her past.  She's mysterious, gorgeous (having been a model), yet very dark and withdrawn.  I don't want to give the plot away, because it is interesting, but I will say that Mason wakes up in the end and Carmen turns out to have a secret of her own.<br />All in all it's not a bad book to read.	2003-08-19

I have some basic observations...<br />1. When you are writing a book about a specific time period, check to find out what actually was going on during that time.  I found numerous references to fashion, songs and styles that were way off on the time scale (meaning, some happened early-mid 90's and the cross references happened earlier or later).<br />2.  When spelling someone's name, again, check the correct spelling. I cannot believe that these publishing companies do not seem to hire qualified proofreaders.<br />Now, with that out the way, let me say that I did enjoy reading this book.  Yarnise Pittman is an interesting character.  While I still prefer \\"The Coldest Winter Ever\\" by Sistah Souljah, the character of Yarnise was eaiser to relate to.  Her mother is an entrepreneur with her own catering business (usually the mother is a [  ] drug user, or a abused victim).  Yarnises' mother had instilled positive traits and values as well as spiritual guidance in her daughter. However, Yarnise did what unfortunately a lot of young women do; get caught up in the man, the paper, the lifestyle and and along the way, suffer for it.  All of this was in the name of love, and many women can relate to the relationship Yarnise has with her relationships. I don't believe in telling the whole book's story in my reivew, but I will say that I read this book in a day, this past Saturday.  It was worth it.	2003-07-28

Celeste and Ronnie Fraiser, two sisters different as night and day, their beloved father has died and neither one can understand their mother, Della.  Good storyline, and great characters make this story worthwhile and enjoyable reading.  I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys stories about family misunderstandings, legacies, joy and pains and forgiveness.  I hope someone can pick this book up and decide to make a movie.  Read and Enjoy!	2003-07-28

I have read 2 of Zane's other books, and to be quite honest, she's entertaining, but I wouldn't call them fascinating. In my opinion it's good reading, summer fluff.  Most of her stories sound vaguely familiar (I'm sorry, but the part when Mary Ann follows Olive and her man in the alleyway?, straight up 9 1/2 weeks, seen it. I mean Jackie Collins wrote this stuff back in the 80's; does anybody remember reading Chances? I was a preteen then and found it the sexual stories hot,).  I can only say that the only way you think that any of this stuff is sexy and exciting, is either you haven't been there and done that, or repressed sexually and need some spice in your life.  If that's the case, read on, you will definitely get some ideas.  Support the sista and buy the book anyway, someone else will get a kick out of it.	2003-06-13

Books that make you almost forget eating!  That's a good book, &quot;Maintenance Man&quot; is the book that does just that.<br />From beginning to end Michael Baisden creates characters that are just like people we know.

Their mother, Helen, let's their father abuse her to no end, and adores Adele, fearing Adele's choice of a lover, Lucien.  Lucien is straight up &quot;no good for nobody&quot; as the old folk's say.<br />There are more problems and situations in this book, told from Lita's point of view.

It took me a week to get through this book, anyone who knows me knows that that is too long.  I was a teenager back in the day and I do remember some stories like Tracy's.  But Tracy's attitude and mannerisms sounded like she was more from the slums than the middle class background the author depicted in the beginning.  Everyone's parents was either weak or missing.  The plot goes into all of the games Tracy has played, then after seeing her friends sister becoming a drug addict she decides to take a turn.  Only after her mother decides to kick her behind and threaten to throw her out in the streets.  (Hey, she won't be able to get some money for clothes shopping!  I gotta change)!  Then, all of a sudden Tracy goes to college (which was somewhat believable since she &quot;somehow&quot; did well in school while being miss &quot;fly&quot;, yet still she is trying to play the game by staying true to Victor, who was the one who &quot;turned her out&quot; first.  I mean please!  No one I knew in the 80's was this stupid.  Apparently from reading other reviews, this kind of thing is &quot;real&quot;.  What I find in those statements is that it is also frightening that children are left to raise themselves.<br />Another thing is that Mr. Tyree is not the best writer.  He can put a story together but it wasn't until the middle of the book that I even cared about any of these characters.  To be honest, I didn't even care about the main characer Tracy, I cared about knowing what happend to Mercedes and Raheema.  Tracy was just to stupid, selfish and self centered for me. I don't feel that she has learned her lesson.  Now Winter in Sister Souljah's &quot;COLDEST WINTER EVER&quot;, she had more hard lessons.  Read that book instead and then we can discuss it.<br />Hopefully the sequel will be better.	2000-09-26

I saw myself, the person I  was involved with, people I know, everyone is a mirror in this book.  The  games people play in relationships are so unnecessary, and this book brings  some of those things to light.  Along the way, you are brought to laughter  when some of the predicaments Stephans' friends get him into, Chantes'  girls drama and the parents of the two main characters.
