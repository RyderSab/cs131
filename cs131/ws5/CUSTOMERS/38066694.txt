Englisch-Deutsch / Deutsch-Englisch (Parat)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Well organized , thorough dictionary	The dictionary includes pollution terminology plus the names of organizations and places important to this field. Words are easy to find, the target word is in bold print, the translation in normal print, explanations in italics. <br /> <br />This dictionary has two sections: the first is English-German, the second German-English. In both sections, the German words are listed with their gender (feminine, masculine, neuter), which I found very useful. If a word is common in one language but not that common in the other, the dictionary provides the correct technical translation plus the more commonly used word in italics; if one particular word has several possible translations in the other language, specific examples plus their translations are provided. For example: \\"affected\\" is translated with the technical term \\"affektiert\\" and the more commonly used \\"befallen\\". This word is translated differently though when used with particular nouns, and the dictionary points those out: \\"affected by drought\\" is \\"von der Duerre betroffen\\", whereas \\"regions affected by oil pollution\\" is \\"von der Oelpest heimgesuchte Gebiete\\". In all other cases, where the translation is clear, the dictionary provides the best correct translation without confusing alternatives. <br /> <br />Acronyms for organizations are given in both languages, e.g.: European Nuclear Energy Agency ENEA, Europaeische Kernenergie- Agentur EKA. For lesser known agencies, the dictionary explains what they are, e.g. African Development Bank ADB (one of the three regional development banks, the other two being the Interamerican Development Bank and the Asian Development Bank). <br /> <br />Overall, I found this dictionary to be thorough, easy to use, and accurate.  <br /> <br />	2005-08-20

Although the book carries the title \\"Alexander Technique\\" it does not teach it. The authors emphasize throughout their book, that the Alexander Technique can be learned only with the help of specially trained teachers and not by reading a book. So, instead of Alexander's technique, the authors offer their own set of exercises, called Leibowitz Procedures. According to the authors, these procedures help you learn to observe yourself in motion, but they are not identical with Alexander Technique. A few pencil drawings accompany extensive descriptions but unless you know what instructions such as \\"let your neck be free and your legs release away from the torso\\" mean, they are not too useful.	2005-07-13

The first 50 pages provide a lot of background information about Swabian food, culinary traditions, how foods were cooked traditionally: from breads and pastries, to fish, meats, and side dishes. Great photographs show the Swabian countryside, cities, bakeries, etc. The following 130 pages give a total of 75 recipes, each accompanied by a photograph of the finished dish. The dishes range from soups to appetizers, fish and meats, pastries, breads, and desserts. Measurements are given in both the European and the American system (grams and ounces, liters and cups or fluid ounces).

Those puzzles are fun because you can learn new words and, with increasingly more letters available, even guess a new word. Easy Italian Crossword Puzzles does not use this type.  <br /> <br />What does the book do? Each word puzzle concentrates on a topic: weather, color, time, animals, etc. The early puzzles give words in English and you need to find the Italian word, or vice versa. Later puzzles give the word in Italian and ask for a synonym in Italian. At the end of the book, you will find answers to all puzzles. The whole book is more of a vocabulary quiz than a puzzle. I was disappointed.	2005-06-26

This book gives the titles of 125 books recommended by independent booksellers, and divides them into three categories: adult fiction, adult non-fiction, and children's books. And that's all. A one-page list of these titles would have provided as much information as this whole books does. <br /> <br />Book Sense does not tell what the books are about. Of course, nobody would expect a synopsis that could spoil the pleasure of reading, but the editors could have given us an idea of the content. Are they thrillers, detective stories, romantic novels, historical novels. What's the basic story line? Only a few articles provide a bit information. Most are meaningless sets of praises, the same kind you find at the back of many books.  <br /> <br />For example, the book \\"The Poisonwood Bible\\" has several comments. One reads: \\"Poisonwood Bible is on my lifetime top-ten-favorite-books list. As I read the first sentences I almost shivered with excitement. Kingsolver's incredible descriptive language had me transfixed and I knew immediately I was going to love this book.\\", The second reads: \\"This is Kingsolver's richest, most complex, and most deeply affecting novel yet. It offers the reader so much on so many levels.\\" This does not tell me anything about the book. It does not help me decide whether I want to read the book. It's only a bunch of empty words. <br /> <br />Amazon.com describes the Poisonwood Bible the following way: \\"In 1959, Nathan Price, a fierce, evangelical Baptist, takes his four young daughters, his wife, and his mission to the Belgian Congo -  a place, he is sure, where he can save needy souls. But the seeds they plant bloom in tragic ways within this complex culture. Set against one of the most dramatic political events of the twentieth century -  the Congo's fight for independence from Belgium and its devastating consequences.\\" This is the kind of description we should have expected from \\"Book Sense Best Books,\\" enough information to help us decide whether or not we want to read this book, enough to get us interested.  <br /> <br />In this sense, \\"Book Sense Best Books\\" completely fails. <br />	2005-02-28

Maybe, I did not count. I did notice, however, that the course has neither structure, nor logic, nor exercises.  <br /> <br />It consists of 3 CDs, one dictionary and a coursebook. Each word in the coursebook is spoken on the CD. All speakers seem to be native Italians. Sounds perfect, doesn't it? The problem is, that for beginning learners this 40-lesson course is pretty useless.  <br /> <br />The first 2 lessons consist of long lists of names of people, cities, countries, Italian words that are similar to English words, the letters of the alphabet etc, all without sentences or context. Just long lists. Lessons 3 and 4 bring words for each of the vowels and consonants. Lesson five counts from 1 to 10, and has another set of lists for days, months, seasons etc. None of these words are used in sentences. Lesson six starts with sentences and explains some grammar, but again you just memorize long lists such as  8 different ways of saying good-bye, or 8 ways of saying nice-to-meet-you. Although those words will be very useful, should you ever get to memorize them out of context, the order in which they appear does not make sense at all. For example, in lesson 10 you learn in this order: the book is red, she is young, ice is cold, he is intelligent, it's me, I am Italian, what is it made of, it is silver, whose is this, the book belongs to Mr. Rossi, it is one o'clock. Etc, etc. Although at the beginning of this lesson you learned all forms of \\"to be\\" (I am, you are, etc.), the sentences deal with \\"is\\" only.  <br /> <br />The course is not organized into topics and has no exercises, only a pretty useless quiz at the end of each chapter. The quiz consists of a few questions and the correct answers. All you need to do is match them correctly. All in all, the book will suit only people who love to memorize long lists of words and sentences. Too bad.	2004-11-26

The accompanying book covers the first two CDs, not the third, but includes a short grammar and a vocabulary list of all the words used in the lessons. Each of the 10 lessons includes conversations in English to set the stage, then the new words and phrases in English and Italian. <br /> <br />The course is advertised as a rush hour course to be used in the car. I think, the lessons require too much concentration to be used while driving.  <br /> <br />Some of the words are used in songs and repeated over and over again -- so you will definitely remember those at the end of the lesson --  others are used in conversations with some opportunity to repeat the phrases after the speaker. Lessons 1 through 3 make sense. After that, the course brings lists of words, e.g. all the days, then all the months, then all the seasons, etc. without much repetition. So, in order to memorize those words, you will have to listen to the same lesson many times. Which would be okay, if the lists were not interrupted by one song that comes again, and again, and again until you are oversaturated. <br /> <br />Although all Italian conversations are spoken by native speakers, the American student often repeats phrases in an American accent. I found that distracting because I really wanted to hear correct Italian only. <br /> <br />The cover text says that the course teaches Italian through songs. In reality, only very few words are used in songs, primarily the easy ones. Why would I need so many repetitions for \\"andiamo\\" or \\"ciao\\", while I get hardly any for more complicated words and phrases?  <br /> <br />I basically was disappointed, although the course does give a basic introduction to Italian. In order to really profit from the conversations and lists, you need to read along in the book. Which means, please don't drive.	2004-11-22

It is not only shorter, but parts of the language are modernized and therefore easier to understand. It contains all the major important events in the story and is full of illustrations that show a child what London looked like at the time the book was written. The captions of the photographs, drawings, and paintings also explain passages of the book, for example the story mentions an almshouse; the illustrations show what it looks like and explains who it was for and why. One of the characters works at a milliner; a drawing shows what a milliner's shop looked like, another shows a silk bonnet made in one of those stores. We see paintings of the streets of London, the clothing of poor and rich people, the food they ate (e.g. brawn), etc.<br /><br />The illustrations and sidebars give children a much better understanding of the story and the time in which Dickens lived. I highly recommend this book for young readers.	2004-11-15

Knowing that most people are not familiar with sea vegetables as food, the author explains what those algae are, how and where they grow, and which ones are edible. She then discusses the nutritional value and provides a misleading chart of nutrients. She claims that some sea vegetables contain 10 times as much calcium as cow's milk, but she compares the values of dried algae to the values of drinkable milk. If she compared edible servings (non-fat milk and rehydrated algae, or non-fat dry milk and dried algae), she would find that milk and wakame (one of the algae highest in calcium) have about the same amount of calcium per serving. Most other algae have lower values.<br /><br />Gusman then goes on to discuss the healing values of algae and claims that they help our bodies fight disease that results form a polluted environment. She does not address the issue of ocean pollution and the fact that algae absorb and therefore contain pollutants, which may or may not be absorbed into our bodies - nobody wants to elaborate on this issue.<br /><br />Her chapter about the individual algae, however, is great. The author describes the algae, shows photographs of the dried products, and tells us how to use them in the kitchen.<br /><br />The major part of the book is dedicated to recipes, many with photographs and additional information about the algae. Some of the recipes have an algae-stranded-on-the-beach flavor. Moreover, when I followed the advice of a Japanese friend to soak, drain and then saut&eacute; Hijiki and Arame in olive oil for three minutes before adding any liquid, and to always add a teaspoon each of sugar and rice vinegar, some of Gusman's recipes became more palatable.<br /><br />I also tried her Nori Condiment, which turned my stomach when I read the recipe, but which tasted surprisingly good in the end. The recipe collection includes soups, salads, snacks, main dishes, vegetables and sweets. Some of them, like the condiments, can be made in a few minutes, others take more time. Some of them are pretty good, others are better without the addition of the seaweed (e.g. curried sweet potato soup does not benefit from the wakame). But overall, I think this is an interesting cookbook worth considering.	2004-10-02

Not all the plants he mentions are herbs, as the title of the book may suggest. He includes nuts, fruits, legumes, and spices.  <br /> <br />In his introduction, he explains which plant names are used in the Bible, why the Bible does not go into detail about their medicinal values, and how translation errors have lead to misinterpretations of Bible passages.  <br /> <br />The major portion of the book is dedicated to the plants themselves. Duke explains their possible benefits and their use in medicine and cooking. He offers folklore, and for some plants even recipes, such as a skin softener made with almond oil, a dandruff shampoo with olive oil, or a wart removal remedy with figs. It's not a book for herbal self-medication, but an herbal encyclopedia on a small scale. I really enjoyed it.	2004-10-02

It is a comprehensive guide to Ayurvedic living The author covers everything from nutrition to exercise and body care, explains why the body gets out of balance, how each of the three doshas reacts differently, and how we can regain health. She includes special elimination therapies, fasts, and breathing techniques, and helps you discover your skin type through a variety of quizzes. <br /> <br />The major part, of course, deals with body care and has simple recipes for homemade shampoos, conditioners, cleansers, baths and much more. In fact, so much more that I recommend you give up your job and hire two servants if you intend to follow her daily beauty regimen. Raichur recommends morning exercise (45 minutes), body self-massage (20 minutes), scalp massage (5 minutes), facial care (up to 15 minutes), saunas (or home alternatives, which she describes), nasal rinses, meditation, yoga, and, well, you name it. Although not all procedures need to be done every day, just following her basic daily routine takes more time than most mothers have.  <br /> <br />Like other Ayurvedic specialists, she does not explain how people with two dosha imbalances should handle the diet recommendations. She does, however, bring good lists with dietary suggestions for each skin type, and these lists include herbs, food, and cosmetics. (According to the author's principle: \\"If you can't eat it, don't rub it on.\\") <br /> <br />Raichur also has her own cosmetics line which is available on the Web. When I discovered that some cosmetics listed the ingredients while others did not, I took out her book again. I was not surprised to see that she includes ingredients in her own cosmetic products that she brands as possible carcinogens or allergens in her book. Again, theory differs from reality. <br /> <br />But in general, her book is a thorough introduction to Ayurveda with lots of advice for healthy living and natural home-made cosmetics.	2004-09-28

Although the book title leads us to believe that Dr. Duke will focus on 13 herbs, he includes about three times that many in his book and discusses them in detail. He tells what the herbs are, how they should be taken and in what quantities, and what possible drawbacks there are.  <br /> <br />This sounds like a very interesting book, but I question the validity of some of the author's claims. First, he emphasizes quantity. All herbs he suggests should be taken \\"as much as you can stand\\", and \\"lots of it\\" (his favorite words). Second, he believes that (low-cost) herbal teas are inferior to (expensive) herbal pills. Third, he uses the same language as the pharmaceutical industry. While pharma-companies, for example, advertise that you need not worry about heartburn from hot Mexican meals as long as you take their pills that prevent it, Dr. Duke says that you can go on an alcohol binge and not worry about a gout attack as long as you take celery seeds. Not a very responsible advice. Fourth, Dr. Duke tells us throughout the book which herbs he himself takes and in what quantities. Considering the amounts he takes, I  wonder if there is any room left in his stomach for actual food. Fifth, the book's title makes you think that Dr. Duke can disease-proof your body, but Dr. Duke admits that he suffers from quite a number of common ailments. So, obviously, the title is inflated. And so may be some of his claims inside the book. <br /> <br />Some of his information is quite useful, especially when he makes cross-comparisons with other edible/medicinal plants, for example horse chestnut, buckwheat, and gingko and tells us how they could help reduce or prevent spider and varicose veins. I was fascinated though, that his own wife does not seem to trust his herbal knowledge and prefers to look for help elsewhere.	2004-09-25

He analyzes the individual characters and their relationships to each other, and shows how they mirror Christian values. He argues that Harry Potter sorcery is in line with Christian philosophy and has nothing to do with occult practices, and that the battle between Gryffindor and Slytherin reflects the battle between devout Christians and \\"those who serve the evil one.\\"  <br /> <br />Although I certainly agree with him on many points, and some of his analyses are brilliant, Granger does stretch the issue a bit. For example, he likens the centaur (a mythical figure half man, half horse) to Jesus who rode into Jerusalem on a donkey. I doubt that Rowling had that in mind. He painstakingly details the alchemical connections in the book, and again goes too far. He relates Hermione's name to a Greek alchemist named Hermes - a name quite common in ancient Greece and probably easy to find in just about any profession - and explains that she and Ron are symbols for mercury and sulfur, respectively. He equates mercury to the brilliant, female, cool alchemical counterpart of the passionate, red, male sulfur. Together mercury and sulfur help to produce gold (Harry). He sees body-mind-spirit in the trio, with Ron representing the body, Hermione the mind, and Harry the spirit or heart. He interprets just about any of the mythical animals as symbols for Jesus: Fawkes, the phoenix who dies and resurrects; Firenze, the centaur who mirrors Christ on his way to Jerusalem; Buckbeak, the hippogriff, James the stag, the Gryffindor lion, and also the philosopher's stone. <br />        <br />Granger also (over)jumps on Rowling's passion for names. Like other authors who wrote about Harry Potter, and sometimes with reference to their books, Granger interprets the Harry Potter names in the Christian context. Which eventually turns Harry Potter into the \\"son of God\\", from the Cockney and French pronunciations `Arry, which sound like \\"heir to\\", and his statement that God is thought of as a potter. Rowling did say in an interview that one of her friends was called Potter and she always liked the name. But I think that's part of the beauty of the Harry Potter books: they can be interpreted in so many ways, and people can identify with the characters in so many ways, that every reader finishes the books satisfied. And this is what makes them classics. <br /> <br />Granger wrote his book for Christian parents to help them understand the underlying Christian theme in the Potter books. I think he did a wonderful job, but in order to fully understand his book you must already have read the five Harry Potter books because he refers to many characters without much of an explanation. <br /> <br />Although I think, Granger occasionally goes overboard, I highly recommend this book to all parents and teachers who still have reservations about letting children read the books. The Harry Potter books are among the best books ever written, and every child should have access to them.	2004-09-19

First, it has no pictures of plants: neither drawings, nor illustrations or photographs. If you want to use this guide, you definitely need a second book that shows what the plants look like. Second, it is not about a technical description of plants but about their spiritual value. The author discusses every plant according to its \\"personality,\\" which is a detailed account of his personal experience with the plant, childhood memories related to the plant, and teachings he got from an Apache elder. We then learn how the plant can be used as food and as medicine. In either case, the author shows clearly how the plant should be harvested, cooked, eaten, stored, prepared and prescribed. He also points to possible dangers if a particular plant can be easily confused with a toxic plant, or when a plant could trigger reactions in allergic people. <br /> <br />Although the spiritual approach may not appeal to everyone, this book is quite informative and in many ways better than the purely descriptive guides. It concentrates on about 45 plants you will find in meadows, fields, and (if you like weeds) in your backyard.	2004-09-08

The school bus she drives plunges right into the water and transforms, as needed,  from bus into submarine, submersible, and surfboard so that her class can reach and explore every part of the ocean. The expedition starts at the continental shelf and moves through continental slope, ocean floor, deep-sea vents and a fringing coral reef. On their way, they children find themselves magically equipped with diving suits and they can now study plants, ocean water, animals and their habitats.  <br /> <br />This book is beautifully illustrated and entertains while teaching important information.

After a general overview of a turtle's life from hatchling to adult, the author describes in detail the currently eight recognized living species of sea turtles: loggerhead, hawksbill, leatherback, Kemp's ridley, olive ridley, green turtle, black turtle, and Australian flatback. He also shows how fishing, pollution, beach armoring, development, raking and beach driving threaten the reptiles' existence, and how various projects aim at increasing the turtle population. <br /> <br />It's a great source of information for anyone: compact, well researched, and thought-provoking.	2004-09-07

He includes but goes beyond discussing dolphin types, habitats, family life, feeding habits, and echolocation. He explains, for example, how dolphins avoid turbulences in water when swimming at high speed; that they are the only animals that can follow instructions given on a TV screen; how they team up with sea birds or use tools to catch prey, and many other fascinating facts. Wonderful photographs show popular and lesser known dolphins such as the bottlenose and  Irrawaddy dolphins in Cambodia, respectively, In the last chapter, the author also discusses ongoing research, and dangers dolphins face from commercial fishing practices, underwater noise pollution, and toxic effluent from land-based industry. <br /> <br />I wish the author had explained  if and how research equipment attached to dolphins affects their swimming, social and feeding habits. Some of the equipment is quite substantial and must interfere in some way. On the one hand he seems so interested in how dolphins avoid turbulences, especially around their heads, on the other hand he does not explain how hydrophones attached to the dolphins' heads interfere with swimming speed, and other behaviors. Overall, however, it is an interesting book with lots of information.  <br />	2004-09-06

But I would never dare to eat any of the plants because the book does not explain whether the edible plants could easily be confused with possibly toxic plants, it does not explain clearly enough how the edible plants should be cooked, and in some places I even question the given advice. For example, we always grew our own elderberries and were taught that the berries should never be eaten raw. They must be cooked. Anger says that the raw berries may not taste good but can be eaten raw. Is he right? I would rather trust my grandmother who grew up poor and often depended on wild plants. <br /> <br />Then I checked another plant I knew well, namely arrowhead. It grows wild in the wetland area of my garden. I had never checked the tubers before but now I did. They grow deep down in oxygen-deprived soil that smells horrible when disturbed. I am not sure I want to eat this plant raw, as the author suggests. In fact, the Peterson Field Guide on edible plants says that the tubers have an unpleasant taste when eaten raw, but taste delicious when cooked. <br /> <br />If you are just interested in knowing which plants can be eaten, this book is quite good. If you actually want to eat some of the plants, also buy the Peterson Field Guide \\"Edible Wild PLants.\\" While Angier has better illustrations, Peterson has better cooking descriptions.	2004-09-05

I only wish the book had more color photographs. <br /> <br />At the end of the book you will find extra sections that help you find edible plants in a specific season. For example, it is spring and you want to make jams, salads, or pickles from a wild plant. The book lists all the plants you can collect during that season. Another section deals with location: which edible plants grow in meadows, wetlands, etc. <br /> <br />The book is well organized, color-coded, fully illustrated, and well indexed.	2004-09-05

It describes a typical ballet class and physical requirements, it addresses concerns adults may have such as fear of ridicule, prior sports injuries, costs and outfits involved, use of French terminology, etc. It also shows that ballet is not only for the fit 25-year-old woman, but equally beneficial to a 50-year-old. And, that many men practice it, too. The authors mention that Vince Lombardi, the \\"very macho\\" coach of the legendary Green Bay Packers, had his players take ballet for coordination, discipline, and endurance. <br /> <br />In addition to dance theory, the book explains dance terminology in words and clear photographs, it also shows ballet exercises that will prepare you for the class.   <br /> <br />The book is realistic, encouraging and a great preparation before you sign up for a class. Finding a ballet school in your area that teaches adults, of course, is another matter, unless you live in a big city. But the book does list many schools all over the United States that accept adults.	2004-08-30

Although it explains poses from easy to difficult, it is too confusing for a beginner who would need a more structured approach. It's a nice book to have in your library, but for learning yoga from scratch you need others. For beginners I recommend Richard Hittleman's \\"Yoga - 28-day exercise plan\\". <br /> <br />Although I like the book and its beautiful (hundreds of) pictures that show individual poses, most asanas are too extreme for adult beginners, or anyone who started yoga as an adult. To achieve those poses you need to start as a child, or be an adult with a gymnastics or ballet background. But for those who are already flexible, the poses are well explained, and the authors also show and explain common problems.  <br /> <br />What distinguishes this book from other yoga books is its benefit list: For each pose, the authors describe in detail its physical, mental, and pranic benefits. They also provide excellent breathing and purification exercises. <br /> <br />I did not care too much for their dietary advice. None of the recipes I tried tasted good, and a purely sattvic lifestyle is out of reach for the average working person. I see no purpose in following a lifestyle that suits a professional yogi in a hot Indian country when I live through snowy winters and a highly enjoyable but stressful job.  <br />	2004-08-30

It is written for anyone who wants to learn yoga at home without a teacher's instruction. In more than 600 photographs Hittleman teaches the asanas step by step. He starts with simple poses, explains and shows clearly how they can be achieved and builds up until you reach more advanced poses.  <br /> <br />At the end of each practice day, the author discusses subjects such as diet, breathing, meditation, weight control, etc. Although the exercises are equally useful to women and men, some of the discussions focus on women. <br /> <br />With this book you can learn yoga at home. Once you have finished the well structured 28-day program, you can continue yoga for the rest of your life with the three practice sessions provided at the end of the book. I have been practicing yoga for years and have built up my own routine from the book. I have looked at other books, but I have never found a better one.	2004-08-30

It shows a series of ashtanga exercises in words and pictures. The poses are so well explained that you won't need an instructor. Unfortunately, many are out of my reach, although I have been practicing yoga for two years. I simply pick out the ones I like and leave the rest for contortionists. But if you either start young or you have a background of gymnastics or ballet, this book will teach you ashtanga yoga at its best.  <br /> <br />Unlike other forms of yoga, ashtanga includes flowing poses, a series of individual poses that are stringed together so that you flow from one into the other. Those are great exercises for developing balance, rhythm and strength. <br /> <br />The author places great emphasis on breathing and explains clearly how to breathe at each step. This is very useful and can be transferred to other yoga exercises as well. Another plus: The book focuses on physical exercise and does not go into nutrition or lifestyle.	2004-08-30

Howard Hall discusses the different types of sharks, how their feeding habits are reflected in their size and shape, how they see, swim, and locate prey. I was surprised to read that they can actually dislocate their jaws and thrust them forward past the end of their noses to bite their prey - and this happens so fast that it can only be seen on film in slow motion. Hall explains why the sharks close their eyes before the attack, that their eyes are so sensitive that they can see in near-darkness, and many other fascinating facts. Although the author uses some advanced terminology such as ovoviviparity, heterocercal tail, Ampullae of Lorenzini, etc, all words are well explained within the text and in a special glossary.

The author, a well known underwater photographer, blends scientific knowledge with his personal experience as a diver. I loved his description of how adult dolphins teach their young ones to hunt fish. We learn what echolocation is and how it helps dolphins to see and experience their environment. And since echolocation can also be felt by a diver, Howard describes what that is like. We learn why dolphins jump, why they follow ships, how their swimming differs from that of other aquatic mammals and fish. And we see that dolphins naturally like to play and even invent their own games with strict rules. <br /> <br />It's a wonderful book with beautiful photography	2004-08-21

Escher fans	This is the best book on tessellations I have seen. Since my main goal was to learn M.C. Escher's technique, I was first surprised to see that the author primarily deals with developing quilt patterns, from simple to complex. Only  the last few chapters are dedicated to M.C. Escher's work. But I realized quickly that every page leads up to the next, teaching more and more intricate patterns until I was able to analyze Escher's work and see for myself how he developed the patterns. <br /> <br />The book is full of illustrations and step-by-step drawings, so that you can soon create your own artistic work. And using a computer drawing program along with the book is not necessary but helpful if you want fast results with many variations. <br /> <br />After reading, or better working through, this book I looked at other books that concentrated on Escher's work, but none of the authors explained his techniques better than Jinny Beyer. Thanks to her clear explanations and drawings I am now able to develop quite intricate designs on my own.	2004-08-18

Incredibly beautiful underwater photography of high quality. The photos do not only depict animals swimming around but, for example, sarcastic fringehead males in a showy territorial \\"fight,\\" close up.  <br /> <br />I also like the authors' sensible view about animals and diving in the ocean. No show-off accounts of near-shark-escapes but an honest experience, mostly good but sometimes scary, of working under water. The authors recount some extraordinary events, such as a ride on a manta after freeing him from entangling fishing nets, or unexpectedly finding themselves surrounded by a school of fish that is being slaughtered by marlins.  <br /> <br />With this book we get a wonderful view into the ocean world but also a fascinating account of what it is like spending many hours a day waiting, scouting, decompressing, refilling tanks and back to waiting so one can capture a never seen one-minute event on film that made it worth all the work.	2004-08-16

She has certainly paid a little attention here and there, and collected many recipes, but she contradicts herself quite often. <BR>At the beginning of the book she lists items according to their yin/yang nature. So, for example, chicken is neutral or yin/yang. But later in the text she refers to chicken as a warming or yang food. <BR>In the various sections on skin care, she lists beneficial foods, and foods to be avoided. In several places, however, she contradicts herself. For example: she says that for a certain skin condition, you should avoid cool-energy foods, but her list of beneficial foods includes several cool-energy items.<BR>The author brings a variety of topical recipes (scrubs, toners, lotions), most made from food items. Many recipes are simple, use foods widely available, and are easy to prepare. Just don't have dandruff, because her vodka-treatment won't come cheap.<br />Some of the edible recipes are quite good and very simple. Others are questionable. For example, her papaya peanut soup consists of pork, papaya, raw peanuts and salt. (Sounds delicious?) The ingredients are cooked for 20 minutes without the addition of water. Well, try that. Good luck.<BR>She also suggests to use surgical gloves when cooking to protect your hands. I wonder whether she has ever handled hot pots in her life, or even stood near a hot stove.<BR>Overall, the book is interesting to read because the author uses food as medicine (instead of pharmaceutical preparations), but it contains many inconsistencies.	2004-04-12

He promotes a high-protein, low-carbohydrate diet which is heavy on fish, especially wild salmon, non-starchy vegetables and a limited variety of fruits. Although he considers his diet balanced, he prescribes a huge number of supplements in large amounts. And he sells a skin-care line at exorbitant prices with questionable ingredients.    Throughout the book he emphasizes his medical training and makes you believe that if you don't trust his advice you prove your ignorance. He shows a series of photographs that he has taken of patients before and after they had undergone his wrinkle-free treatment. The pictures show no difference at all although he keeps pointing to the lack of blemishes on the faces. The blemishes are there, before and after. The only visible difference is that many of the patients wear make-up on the after-pictures while they were photographed without make-up before the treatment. In two patients the after-pictures show more wrinkles or blemishes than in the previous photographs. This, of course, can be due to photography, lighting, etc. but whatever the reason, the photographs do not prove his claims (namely that his diet reduces wrinkles).    Perricone claims that his diet is well balanced and healthy. I wonder why he has to supplement it with such large amounts of vitamins and minerals. To his benefit, though, he does list foods that contain those vitamins naturally.     Throughout the book, Perricone emphasizes the value of fish, especially salmon, which you should eat at least 5 times a week, and possibly more often. He recommends wild salmon, which is the most expensive salmon available but, according to government sources, also the least polluted. In addition to salmon he also recommends mackerel, tuna, and later on the list, swordfish - all three are known to have high concentrations of heavy metals. (And while some of them are still acceptable under US government standards, they are not by Canadian government standards.) I am not refuting that fish is healthy, but from all the data I have read about toxins in food, no diet should rely so much on aquatic animals.    The Perricone diet recommends primrose and borage oils, while other authors question its use, especially the forerunner of the omega-connection Dr. Artemis P. Simopoulos. She states that both oils convert in the human body to arachidonic acid, which causes inflammation.    I also wonder about his meal combinations. Salmon for breakfast does not strike me as too odd, if you can afford it. But combining salmon with raspberries? Or hard-boiled egg with strawberries? Or salmon with oatmeal and blueberries? Those combinations are not created for a sane palate but from a list of food items that fulfill certain requirements: no starch, no sugar, high protein.    Omitting sugar and junk food from one's diet is certainly good advice. And this alone will get results But the rest of it, I am unconvinced. Especially because the before-and-after photographs do not prove the author's point.    To complete my search, I looked at his cosmetics line on the Web. Two ounces of Firming Activator cost $95 on-line! 6 ounces of Nutritive Cleanser cost $30. Both products list ingredients that are known skin irritants, such as fragrances, parabens, and according to some studies, sodium laureth sulfate. The products also contain diazolidinyl urea, which is a preservative said to release formaldehyde.    I would like to end my critique with a statement Perricone made in the New York Times on November 18, 2001, saying \\"Promise them an unlined face, and you can sell them anything.\\" His book, and especially his cosmetic line, reflects that attitude. He is selling the Empress new clothes.	2003-10-06

The author discusses the traditional indexing method with cards. Her advice on software is outdated, we are far beyond DOS. Otherwise the book provides all the information you need and gives a good idea of what's involved, e.g. that it's not a leisurely job, why not everyone who can read can index, about indexing associations, etc. A very useful book for the professional.	2003-03-12
