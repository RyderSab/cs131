US	52719842	R1BNMRJQFUBYH2	0061056413	261586248	Year's Best SF	Books	4	16	17	N	N	A good start to a &quot;Best of&quot; series	When David Hartwell started his own annual series of the year's best SF with this volume in the mid nineties, the doorstopper series edited by Gardner Dozois had been running for over a decade. Hartwell made some passing references to other anthologies being unfocused but otherwise he avoided the issue and that begged the question of why this series started and should you buy it instead of or as well as the Dozois book?<br />On the strength of this, the first volume, I am happy to recommend Hartwell's choice to anyone who is into SF in the traditional sense. That does not mean that the contents are old fashioned just that the contents are certainly Science Fiction and not some related genre.<br />The fourteen stories here, all of which were written in 1995, include works by a selection of the best of contemporary SF authors. Writers like Silverberg, Baxter, Benford, Kress, Haldeman, Woolfe, Zelazny and Sheckley rarely disappoint though the last of those is represented here by one of his weaker recent works.<br />The highlights for me were Joe Haldeman's &quot;For White Hill&quot; and Robert Silverberg's &quot;Hot Times in Magma City&quot;. The first is a tale of war, art, love and sacrifice set on a ruined Earth in the far future and the second is set in a near future LA beset by volcanic eruptions. The producers of &quot;Volcano&quot; and &quot;Dante's Peak&quot;, a pair of similarly themed disaster movies should have studied Silverberg's tale to see how to inject some real humanity into the subject.<br />Like the Silverberg story, William Spencer's &quot;Downloading Midnight&quot;, Gene Wolfe's &quot;The Ziggurat&quot; and &quot;Evolution&quot; by Nancy Kress are all set on a contemporary or near future Earth and all three are compelling and rewarding stories.<br />Stephen Baxter's &quot;Gossamer&quot; and Gregory Benford's &quot;A Worm in the Well&quot; demonstrate that the traditional setting of space travel in the Solar System can still give rise to highly enjoyable and original ideas that bring &quot;golden age&quot; styles right up to date.<br />This is not a perfect book, there are still a couple of stories here that left me wondering what the editor was thinking (or smoking) when he included them but on the whole, the book stands as justification for the fact that there is certainly room for another &quot;years's best&quot; series.  If you buy Gardner Dozois' books, you should give this volume a go as well.	2002-07-10
US	52719842	R2ESLNTIW82A4W	0061020540	571216131	Year's Best SF 5	Books	3	2	3	N	N	Missed the mark	Beginning in the mid nineties and running at least to the present, David Hartwell produces the alternative \\"year's best\\" anthologies. The primary series is of course the similarly titled one edited by Gardner Dozois. In some years the Hartwell selection is at least as good as the generally larger Dozois version. In the fifth year of his endeavours though he missed the mark and this book is not so good. Certainly it is not up to the standards of some of the earlier anthologies.<br />Of course, there are some good stories in here. A competant editor could hardly gather together 25 tales and disappoint with them all but the truth is that less than a dozen of them are better than average for current SF and that hardly counts as \\"year's best\\" even if you take into account the fact that there is no overlap with Gardner Dozois' book which presumably gets first choice with the authors.<br />I think that the best story here is Steven Baxter's \\"Huddle\\" which tells of a future Earth stricken in an ice age and populated by people genetically engineered to survive the bitterly cold conditions. Perhaps it is a sign of the times but all of the best stories here deal with the alteration of humans in order to deal with the pressures of life in the future. Terry Bisson's \\"Macs\\" introduces the ides of creating clones of criminals just so that they may be killed by the families of their victims while Curt Wohleber's \\"100 Candles\\" and Tom Purdom's \\"Fossil Games\\" are set in futures in which it is normal for people to be extensively altered and those who have no, or few, alterations feel increasingly excluded from their worlds.<br />If you are the kind of fan who just cannot get enough short SF then this is worth getting as you will find some interesting stories but otherwise, you might as well give this a miss and hope for a better effort next year.	2002-05-26
US	52719842	R2G7QQTRB9T3A1	0851126073	90264174	Guinness Book of Flying Blunders (Series in Robotics & Intelligent Systems)	Books	1	3	4	N	N	Very poor	What else do you need to know about an aviation book written by a man who thinks that stalling an aircraft means that the engine stops?<br />For me, this error was compounded in a later passage on the mistaken bombing, by the USAF, of the Swiss town of Schaffhausen. The author states that Schaffhausen lies on the East bank of the Rhine. In the vicinity of Schaffhausen, the Rhine flows from East to West so, it has North and South banks and not an East bank. When I come across things like this I have to say that every other factual statement in the book must be in doubt.<br />This book is really a lightweight skim through the history of aerial warfare with emphasis on the mistakes that were made. Of course, this is a fairly easy target as military aviation is a rapidly developing area and so mistakes are common.<br />Trying to discount errors like the ones mentioned above, the writing style is OK and the author does choose a number of interesting events.<br />The book starts off with a token section on the era before the first world war.<br />The sections devoted to that war, the inter-war years and the post 1945 period are quite short. Fully half of the book is devoted to the years of World War Two.<br />Unfortunately, once coverage reaches the second war, the author seems to forget what he is actually writing about. Half of the section discusses the politics of area bombing. The author then moves on to discuss the errors in the planning of parachute operations leaving the reader to wonder where have the aeroplanes gone.<br />I am always suspicious of books which are published under different titles. This book has appeared as a book of \\"Flying\\" blunders and as a book of \\"Air Force\\" blunders. The latter title is more accurate as the book contains nothing about civilian flying and indeed, much of the content is about military matters that do not actually include flying.	2002-04-21

The stories are all related to the theme of directed biological mutations and they cover a range of topics from viruses designed to introduce new genetic material into humans to complete engineered ecosystems.<br />Each story is introduced by the editors with a capsule biography and reading list for the story's author. Those notes are useful but if you read more than a couple of these collections you will start to see the same introductions cropping up as the editors tend to assemble about two thirds of the content from a group of a dozen or so writers.<br />For me, the highlight of the book was the last story, Cordwainer Smith's &quot;A Planet Named Shayol&quot; which had the sort of ghastly desolation in its atmosphere that I normally associate with Harlan Ellison at his best. It tells about a group of criminals sent for eternity to a punishment planet where they are used to grow spare body parts for transplant surgery.<br />Brian Stableford's &quot;The Pipes of Pan&quot; is another fine story dealing with immortality and the problem of people wanting children in a world where you cannot allow children to grow up because you would then have too many people.<br />With other tales from the likes of Paul J.McAuley, Frederik Pohl, Greg Egan, John Brunner and Bruce Sterling, you can expect to find a lot of good things to read. I rate this as one of the better books in the series and recommend it to any fan of SF short stories. If you enjoy this book and hard SF stories in general, try to get hold of a copy of Nanotech and after that Space Soldiers and Future War in the same series.	2002-02-14
US	52719842	R3ORCMZ3RX1YKL	044100704X	246643435	Aliens among Us	Books	3	4	5	N	N	Too much padding	This is another of the themed SF anthologies compiled by Dann and Dozois in recent years. As with the others, unless you have been an avid SF short story readaholic for the last four of five decades, you will certainly find a large number of new and interesting stories here.<br />The book opens with a powerful and timeless story &quot;The Other Celia&quot; by SF master Theodore Sturgeon, in which the occupier of a cheap hotel room discovers that the resident in the room below his is in fact an alien. That of course sets the scene for the rest of the book in which the world seems to be overwhelmed by non humans disguised as people.<br />While it is not great, that is a good story and the collection includes a number of similarly enjoyable tales. Ray Nelson's &quot;Eight o'clock in the morning tells of a lizard like race that has come to dominate and eat humans through the power of hypnosis. I also enjoyed the stories from Philip K.Dick, Robert Reed, Michael Shea and Avram Davidson as well as the collaboration between Paul J.McAuley and Kim Newman.<br />All in all, there are nine very readable stories in here and they are easily worth the price of the book. What is a little frustrating is that there are also six stories which are not really up to scratch. I'd have enjoyed this collection rather more if it had not included stories such as R.A.Lafferty's &quot;Among the Hairy Earthmen&quot; which is little more than an undeveloped idea and a number of dates from a history book.<br />I'd have rated this book higher if the editors had left out the padding and higher still if they had filled out their allocation of pages with material as good as the books highlights.	2002-01-20

The only small problem with its inclusion is that it is so well known that it may not be new to most readers. It is not the only fine tale here. Ian McDonald's &quot;Floating Dogs&quot; is a fascinating tale of a proxy war fought between armies of automated weapons and augmented, computer directed animals who fight with no real concept of the purpose of the war and who thus make almost perfect soldiers.<br />If you want tales of war on earth, in space or even spread across the dimensions, you can get them all here and there are a lot  good stories in this colection. As usual in this series, there are brief biographical and bibliographial notes for each author should the reader feel the need to explore further.	2002-01-13
US	52719842	R3BKUUEZ45OZNK	0441008240	293019063	Space Soldiers	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Four good stories, one masterpiece and a few lesser tales	This book is another in the series of themed anthologies co-edited by Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois. It contains nine stories on the subject of war in space that were first published between 1965 and 2000. While it is not the best book in the series, it does contain some good stories and one absolute gem.<br />The highlight is Stephen Baxter's &quot;On the Orion Line&quot; which is as good as space adventure gets. It's about a war between men and aliens who are able to manipulate some of the basic laws of physics. It is the kind of story that you just cannot leave in the middle and it's a great introduction to Baxter.<br />As well as that tale, Paul McAuley, Alaistair Reynolds, Fred Saberhagen and Joe Haldeman all weigh in with interesting stories. Because of the wide time-span from which the stories have been drawn, most readers will find that a good portion of the stories are new and the editors provide biographical and bibliographical notes for further reading.<br />If you like the hard side of the science fiction spectrum and you are not already familiar with the authors mentioned, you will find this book to be a good buy. If you want more of the same, I'd suggest the anthology &quot;Nanotech&quot; by the same editors which is an even better collection.	2001-12-16
US	52719842	R2L7UYXWYMELRM	0441006752	833170019	Armageddons	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Some good stuff but a lot of filler	For those not familiar with the format, Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois have compiled a large number of themed anthologies each of which contains a number of stories dealing with a single topic. This book fills its 269 pages with twelve stories on the subject of the end of the world. They date from 1951 to 1998. Five of those stories are well worth reading but the rest are filler.<br />The finest story here is &quot;A Pail of Air&quot; by Fritz Lieber. It tells of a dark star passing through the solar system and dragging the Earth away. Without the sun it gets so cold that even the air freezes. How can people survive in this world? The other truely outstanding tale is Frederick Pohl's &quot;Fermi and Frost&quot; which describes a world slowly freezing over in the wake of a nuclear war. If you have not read those two stories before, they pretty well justify buying the book.<br />Gregory Benford, Nancy Kress and Raccoona Sheldon  (aka James Tiptree Jr.) merit mention for their three stories all of which deal with the potential of advanced biotechnology to finish us off.<br />The remaining stories do contain some interesting ideas but in general, they are just not very well written and I think that the editors could have been more critical in the material that they included.	2001-11-18
US	52719842	R3JJPQATV01DJF	1565921275	700492242	Essential System Administration (Nutshell Handbooks)	Books	4	22	22	N	N	Essential is the word	If you are performing any level of system administration on any varient of Unix then this is a great  book to have on your desk. It covers just about all aspects of system administration necessary for small to medium systems and networks.<br />Each topic is dealt with first by an approachable description of what is going on, a discussion of the differences between different systems and some examples of commands or configuration files together with a discussion of what each example is doing and how it does it. It really is an easy way to work out what you need to do on your own system.<br />The structure works equally well as an aide memoir or as a tutorial to a new topic and this is backed up by an effective index which seems to guide me to the right part of the book much more reliably than is the case in many computing texts.<br />Although the book, even in its second edition, is now several years old, it is still relevant. The basics if the task do not change and, even if the task in hand has changed a little, reading and understanding the section in the book will leave you well placed to sort out minor variations which is not something that you would get from just plugging away at the man pages.<br />The main thing that is missing as a result of this is coverage of completely new material, don't expect to find anything about IPv6 or running a webserver for example. That is not such a big problem though as if you are dealing with these issues, you will almost certainly need books on those subjects as well as a general admin book.<br />For me, it is simple, this is a book that lives on my desk and not on my bookshelf. It helps me out with my mixed network of Linux, Solaris, SunOS and FreeBSD.	2001-11-04
US	52719842	R2ZTT8H4R1D9YG	0425179613	495393406	It's Not About the Bike: My Journey Back to Life	Books	4	8	10	N	N	An extraordinary story, well told	Lance Armstrong's life is a fascinating tale and Sally Jenkins tells it very well. The basic outline is well known. From a tough background in Texas, Armstrong entered the world of professional cycling and won the world road racing championship. It appeared that he had a great career ahead of him but in 1996 he was struck by testicular cancer. By the time that he visited a doctor, the cancer was advanced and had spread to his lungs and brain. Despite the poor prognosis, he recovered from the disease and went on to return to the highest levels of professional cycling and win the Tour de France, the sport's blue ribbon event.<br />Sally Jenkins is an accomplished sports writer and she has done a fine job to render Armstrong's story into a gripping and fluid read. I finished this book in one sitting and I think that many readers will do the same. In terms of gritty detail, there is more about cancer treatment than about the Tour de France and the detail is explicit. Reading this book will give you a vivid picture of what it is like to face a course of chemotherapy.<br />I do not want to make a judgment on the man himself. Some readers will be in awe of his achievements while others will be exasperated by his faults. I cannot recommend this book as an inspirational read either. Anyone who can complete the Tour de France let alone win it posesses levels of physical and mental toughness that are so far beyond normal experience as to seem superhuman. Rather than being inspired, a cancer sufferer given this book to read could just as easily see the message that if you are superman, you can fight cancer. Seen instead as a fascinating tale the book is a compelling read.<br />Even if you have no interest in cycling, this book is still worth reading. I am very glad that I read it and I think that most people who pick it up will feel the same way.<br />You will probably want to buy one of the later editions as they contain additional material relating to Armstrong's second tourwin in 2000.	2001-10-28
US	52719842	R2ZFAMZ1CMSFV0	0234773812	831906661	Like Nothing on Earth	Books	3	6	6	N	N	Funny but dated	This collection of seven short stories was first published in the seventies though the stories themselves first appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine in its glory days. The stories are packed full with interesting ideas and they are often very funny. Having said that, it is important to point out also that modern readers will find that the stories themselves have a rather dated feel. The author's novels have stood the test of time far better than have his shorter works.<br />My favourite story from the collection is &quot;Allamagoosa&quot; which projects a &quot;Sgt Bilko&quot; view of military life into a future of interstellar space ships and hyperspace drives. The stories are not all humorous: &quot;Ultima Thule&quot; lands its protagonists in a pretty bleak scenario with no light relief.<br />If you are a fan of period SF, then you may well enjoy this but, if you are new to the author, I'd suggest that you try some of his novels first. &quot;Wasp&quot; and &quot;Three to Conquer&quot; would be a good place to start.	2001-08-05

It is a general GSM book that has been updated in its second edition to include coverage of GSM, WAP and UMTS and not a book specifically about these subjects.<br />This book covers all aspects of GSM cellular radio systems in a moderate degree of detail. It is more suited to readers who are working with, or studying, the technology than to those who are just interested in how their telephone works.<br />The breadth of coverage means that nothing is dealt with in sufficient depth to be your sole source of information on any one aspect of the technology. That does not mean that the book is worthless. Anyone with a professional interest in one particular area of GSM networks will benefit from having a reasonable understanding of the rest of the technology and that is what this book provides.<br />It is handy to have all of this material in one place with a coherent picture of how everything fits together and if you were leading a GSM project, you would probably feel happy if all of your team had read this book in addition to having in depth knowledge of their particular area of responsibility.<br />These things are however spoiled by the quality of the translation from the original French. Despite his background in electronics, the translator appears to have little knowledge of the actual subject matter. This is clear in those areas where there is established technical terminology in English. The translation frequently uses a literal translation of a French term rather than substituting in the standard English term.<br />In other parts of the book, the translator just appears to have been lazy or careless or perhaps just not to have understood the material at all. Some sentences appear to be step by step word substitutions thus retaining a non-English structure with English words.<br />In particular, the translator appears not to understand the concepts of public key cryptography and the section on encryption reads like an undergraduate essay written by somebody who was asleep in most of the relevant lecture.<br />These things do matter as it just makes it harder read the book when it is necessary to keep wading through such poor writing and muddled explanations.<br />Finally, there are too many technical typos. It is unacceptable that a book such as this should give wrong frequencies for radio transmission!<br />Properly translated, this book would have merited four stars. As things stand, it only receives two.	2001-07-23

(MASTER BRIDGE)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A worthy successor to the &quot;Abbot&quot; books	Master Bridge humourist David Bird tackles an almost new scenario with this book. Almost new in that his earlier book &quot;The Abbot and The Sensational Squeeze&quot; included a short section in which the famous Bridge playing Abbot spent some time as the host on a bridge cruise.<br />In this book, we are introduced to a completely fresh cast of characters lead by the cruise host Mr Knight. He is usually known as Rupert Knight though the poor standard of proof reading common to Bird's recent works causes him to become Ralph on occasion. As with Bird's rather weak Robin Hood books, many of the hands are the work of Tim Bourke but happily in the case of this book, the bridge content is rather more interesting.<br />The bridge described alternates between ship board duplicate sessions and on shore rubber bridge with an unlikely cast of characters enountered by the cruise passengers. This allows reasonable variety and provides scope for the wit for which David Bird is highly regarded.<br />The real test has to be: how does this book compare to the &quot;Abbot&quot; books? Certainly this book is closer to the mark than the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; books and it will not disappoint his fans.<br />If you have not read any of Daid Bird's books before, I suggest that you try to get hold of some of the earlier books in the &quot;Abbot&quot; series. You really cannot go wrong with the ones that were co-authored with Terence Reese.	2001-07-22

David bird has now become a major brand name in the world of Bridge humour for his &quot;Monks of St.Titus&quot; books about the Bridge playing Abbot and his charges. The publishers want to capitalise on this brand by extending it in the same field. So, when it was decided that Ron Klinger's series of &quot;Jewish humour&quot; bridge magazine articles should be issued in book format, the publishers wanted to get the Bird brand on the cover.<br />David Bird set to work with Ron Klinger to expand the articles for book format and this is the result. If you are a fan of the Abbot, you will find this book very appealing. It is much better than the &quot;Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;Cruise Liner&quot; books.<br />The hands are, presumably, the work of Ron Klinger and they are good indeed. They are substantially better than the ones in David Bird's &quot;Robin Hood&quot; books. Good as they are, they are not free from errors. For example, in one case, a player holding a singleton trump is described as leading a second round of trumps.<br />The humour is straight, down the line Jewish and indeed, you might almost expect to find Maureen Lipman turning up to play at the Synagogue pairs. It is funny and it adds enough levity to keep the readers interest even as some of the trickiest hands are described. <br />Once you have read all of the Abbot books, you will certainly want to read this.	2001-07-14
US	52719842	R1D0NGXMTT1WML	0713482451	236228077	Robin Hood's Bridge Memoirs	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Not Recommended	David Bird rightly received many plaudits for his fine series of books describing the Bridge playing antics of the fictional monks of St.Titus Abbey. His Robin Hood series appears to be an attempt to broaden the franchise and, as is often the case, he has brought in others to assist with this while still keeping the David Bird badge on the cover.<br />In this book, many of the hands were devised by Tim Bourke with the author adding his humour and general style.<br />This book follows the format of &quot;The Bridge Adventures of Robin Hood&quot; in that most of the hands described take place in a rubber bridge setting and they are of a different character to those of the Abbot series.<br />I have two reservations about this book. The first is the general tone and quality of the humour. The jokes continue in the same vein as in the first book of the series. An example is the setting in which a bridge playing whore named &quot;French Laura&quot; is referred to as having &quot;gone down&quot; more times than her Bridge partner. I'm afraid that all of this wears a little thin over the course of a book.<br />The second problem is the way that the settings are described. Of course, the legend of Robin Hood is far from being historical truth and the author must be given plenty of leeway but when he refers to real historical characters and events and misplaces them by 100 years it does work to break the suspension of disbelief necessary for full enjoyment of the book.<br />Fans of the author's other humour run the risk of disappointment with this book.<br />Because of those issues, I cannot really recommend this book it falls some way short of the standard of Bird's better known series and as bridge humour, it is below par.	2001-06-17
US	52719842	RE4G73JV2ESX7	0713476427	536559247	The Bridge Adventures of Robin Hood	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Not so good as the &quot;Abbot&quot; books.	Having achieved great success with his humorous bridge fiction involving the monks of St Titus, David Bird sought to move his bridge tales out into other areas. One of the first was to move the game back several centuries and have the game played by the outlaw Robin Hood in Sherwood Forest near Nottingham.<br />As with the &quot;Abbot&quot; series, each chapter in the book puts the protagonists into a situation that allows them to play bridge and provides a backdrop for the humour that is what makes up such a large part of the appeal of this genre. Each hand is presented as a play problem and there is an opportunity for the reader to try to tackle it as a double dummy problem before seeing the solution found, or not found, by the players.<br />One of the things that has changed with the new scenario is the bridge. Here, rather than playing almost exclusively in duplicate tournaments, the characters are almost always seen playing rubber bridge, often for substantial stakes. That does change the nature of the problems that are set and in general, they seem to be easier and less interesting than the puzzles that face the Abbot and his monks. To be picky the bridge problems are not without mistake. On at least one hand the line of play described in the narrative does not lead to the end position shown in tabular form.<br />The humour changes also. While the St. Titus books are close to the &quot;Yes Minister&quot; school of humour, Robin Hood and his friends come right out of the bawdy end of a &quot;Carry on&quot; film. Keen Bridge players are rarely prudes but they are not so likely to be amused by jokes about which player ends up with which cheap ....<br />Compared to the &quot;Abbot&quot; books then, this is not so good. If your are new to David Bird, I would suggest one of the books in the monks series as a far better introduction. Fans of David Bird's bridge humour will be interested in this books in any case and, while it is not of the highest standard, it is still above average for the genre.	2001-06-14

Previously, the magazine articles written by Bird had been revised by the original author together with Terence Reese prior to book publication. After the death of the latter, David Bird continued to work alone. Of course, he was always the original author and it was never made clear exactly how great an input Reese had to the book revisions.<br />Like all of the other works in this series, this book follows the adventures of the fictional bridge playing monks of the order of St. Titus. Each chapter sees the monks in some bridge situation where they play a number of hands. The bidding is normally English Acol style but this is secondary to the play of the hands which is where the interesting bridge problems can be found.<br />While the earlier books all concentrated on the exploits of the monks in England, they also contained a number of chapters detailing the exploits of a missionary outpost in Africa. Political correctness having see off that scenario, the &quot;away&quot; section of the book has the Abbot, the leading character, playing as the guest expert on a bridge cruise, an interlude which is a lot less funny than the rest of the book.<br />If you are new to the monks of St.Titus, I would recommend that you first track down some of the earlier books. Especially the first two: &quot;Miracles of Cardplay&quot; and &quot;Unholy Tricks&quot; as they are funnier and fresher. However, if you are already a fan of these books, do not hesitate. Reese may be missing from the front cover and the wit may not be as sharp but you will still enjoy the contents.	2001-06-01

The series continued later with David Bird working alone after the death of Reese. The pieces here all appeared in various bridge magazines in the years immediately before publication in the book form. The original articles were the sole work of David Bird and Terence Reese helped to enhance them for publication in book format.<br />As is the case with the other books in the series, the book contains a series of chapters each dealing with a particular fictional bridge theme with the characters that have been established over the years. As well as being the last book with Reese's involvement, it is the last in the series to feature the fictional missionary outpost in Africa. Political correctness having finally quashed a very funny setting.<br />All of the hands pose an interesting play problem and, as well as showing the solution, the authors describe the analysis process by which the players arrive at the correct (or wrong) line of play. The post mortem discussion for each hand, as well as being amusing, gives a further picture of the way that a hand might have been played. It's a little frustrating that this section varies quite a bit in detail. On some hands, all that is said is something like &quot;leading a spade would break up the squeeze&quot; with no real clarification of the position. That's fine for some readers but more detail might make the position clearer for others.<br />Reading this book, I got the feeling that some of the characters are getting a little stale and that has cut into the humour factor to an extent. From a Bridge point of view, the problems posed and the exposition of the way in which they are solved are  as good as ever. My recommendation is that you do not buy this book as an introduction to the series. Any of the earlier books in the series, particularly &quot;Miracles of Card Play&quot; or &quot;Unholy Tricks&quot;, would make a better introduction.	2001-05-28
US	52719842	R7ZIGJCTXIBQY	0441089348	461969075	Burning Chrome	Books	5	3	3	N	N	A collection that you must not miss.	This collection contains ten stories, seven of which are solo works by William Gibson and the other three are collaborations. Nine appeared previously between 1977 and 1985 and one was new for this collection.<br />Gibson writes hard, technical cyber-punk SF with the art of a real master of the short story genre. Good SF shorts are of course all about ideas, situations and snappy plot twists but great examples of this genre also pack in characters that you can understand and root for and worlds that come to life in your head. It is hard to do that and only a handful of writers can turn out work of this quality.<br />The opening shot in the book, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; is one of those rare tales that burns its way into your head. Reading it is almost like being there watching the events unfold. The narrative makes the outlandish grunge-tech future come to life and it is easy to see how this tale inspired the making of a movie.<br />It is a powerful start and the rest of the book does not disappoint. From the anonymous barfly world of &quot;The Belonging Kind&quot;, up into the dying orbit of an old Russian space station in &quot;Red Star, Winter Orbit&quot; and back to the seedy hacker world of &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; Gibson delivers a set of tales for which the phrase &quot;assault on the senses&quot; is no exaggeration.<br />The book is a fine introduction to both Gibson and the cyber-punk genre and it is a book that every SF fan should own and re-read regularly. If you like it and to want to explore similar work, I'd suggest &quot;A Good Old Fashioned Future&quot; by Bruce Sterling, or the &quot;Mirrorshades&quot; anthology.	2001-05-27

They were much loved on the air display circuit and, when they were finally retired from military and display service, they were much missed.<br />This book charts the remaining Vulcan aircraft. It lists all of the surviving aircraft and goes into substantial detail of each one from the construction details, through the aircraft's deployments and ultimate fate. The problem is that this means that the text in the book is mostly a list of dates, squadron numbers and airfield details. Now this information is of interest to a small number of people but I'm not sure about who would be interested in such information only for the small number of aircraft that survive. Most diehard enthusiasts want to know this information for all of the aircraft produced. Casual readers will find the text dull.<br />Like most books of this nature, the photos are at least as important as the text. The publisher does its usual good job in the production. The pictures are well rendered and printed on quality paper. They are not perfect. Some photos have been carelessly cropped late in the production process so that parts of the picture referred to in the captions are not reproduced. That is sloppy.<br />The book's remit, dealing only with the surviving airframes means that the material is limited. It is hard to make interesting photos of a series of scrap airframes on static display and the book suffers for that.	2001-05-01
US	52719842	RTMC6IGKO4NV2	0553562819	511407628	Globalhead	Books	4	2	3	N	N	A mixed bunch of stories	In this book, you will find 11 stories by Bruce Sterling and two collaborations. All but one of the stories has prviously appeared in magazine form between 1985 and 1991.<br />Most of the stories here are well worth reading. Especially &quot;Hollywood Kremlin&quot; and &quot;Are You For 86?&quot; which introduce Leggy Starlitz, one of Sterling's enduring characters. Also, the two collaborations, &quot;Storming the Cosmos&quot; and &quot;The Moral Bullet&quot; respectively with Rudy Rucker and John Kessel, are very good.<br />There are also one or two stories here which quite fankly should not have seen the light of day. &quot;The Sword of Damocles&quot; is the sort of exercise often tackled in writer's workshops and that is where is should have stayed.<br />There is not as much hard science in here in some of Sterling's other books but that does not detract from this collection. Indeed, a number of the best stories would escape all but the broadest definition of SF.<br />In the Leggy Starlitz tales, Sterling lays out lots of technical trivia in the same style as do many thriller writers. His facts are often wrong and self contradicting. Often laughably so and that does detract from the writing.<br />This is not the best collection to introduce you to Sterling's short fiction. I would recommend &quot;A Good Old Fashioned Future&quot; as an introduction but if you read and enjoy that and want more, you will not be disappointed by this book.<br />If you enjoy this book and want to read something in the same vein, I'd suggest William Gibson's collection &quot;Burning Chrome&quot; or the anthology &quot;Mirrorshades&quot; edited by Bruce Sterling.	2001-04-16

A lot of people skip introductions to books which is just as well in the case of this one but the contents really do not need an introduction.<br />The eleven stories here, first published between 1957 and 1969, can stand up and speak for themselves very well indeed. From the opening shot of the title story to the close with &quot;A boy and his dog&quot; the author delivers a fine selection of his work. <br />There are no weak stories in this book, every one is a good read. The title story, &quot;Try a Dull Knife&quot;, &quot;Santa Claus VS. S.P.I.D.E.R.&quot; and &quot;A boy and his dog&quot; are my favourites and they show the range of Ellison's talents from horror to science fiction and also display his characteristic cynical humour.<br />&quot;A boy and his dog&quot; is the best known story here largely because it has been made into a very controversial film. It also happens to be one of Ellison's finest stories and that is praise indeed. It tells the story of fifteen year old Vic and his telepathic dog Blood in a post apocalypse America. Even though it is a brutish story, Ellison's wit and lucid writing style make it a compelling read.<br />The stories here will appeal to almost any SF fan though, if you are new to Ellison, the book &quot;The Essential Ellison&quot; is a better first buy. If you like this author and wonder what else you might like to read, I'd suggest short story collections by Bruce Sterling and Eric brown.<br />Although this book is out of print, it is available together with the anthology &quot;Love ain't nothing but sex misspelled&quot; as volume four of the Edgeworks series. I note though that the contents of the Edgeworks version are not the same as the contents of my copy of this book.	2001-03-28
US	52719842	R1T290WXXFP5JE	0575062940	614914894	Cardinal Sins (Master Bridge Series)	Books	5	9	10	N	N	More great bridge humour from Reese and Bird.	This is the fourth book in the series about the bridge playing exploits of the fictional Monks of St. Titus Abbey. It follows the format of the earlier books in that each chapter contains a small number of hands played by a common set of characters in a specific setting. A bonus in this book is the first appearance of Robin Hood and his band of outlaws playing against the Sheriff of Nottingham.<br />As usual, the stories have all previously appeared in assorted Bridge magazines and, for book publication, they have been honed by Reese working with David Bird the original author.<br />One of the best aspects of this series is that the authors add a liberal quantity of wit to lighten the serious bridge content. You can read this book for the narrative with the technical problems as a bonus but it is certainly well worth trying to work out the play problems before seeing how they are solved in the book. Most of the problems should be within the grasp of a good club player and, if you get stuck on them, the narrative gives an insight into the thought processes of the players who wrestle with the problems in the book.<br />Despite the fact that it is one of a long running series, this book is not stale. I strongly recommend it to any bridge enthusiast who has a sense of humour.	2001-03-23
US	52719842	RNQE1FXMP3LRR	1875671110	81907195	Air Disaster, Vol. 1	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Clear, definitive and not sensationalist.	This book is a collection of descriptions of 18 jetliner accidents from the Comet accidents of the mid fifties to the Tenerife disaster of the late seventies.<br />The book is written from an Australian perspective which is no bad thing as this eliminates any US or European centred view that is common in many other books on civil aviation. <br />Each incident is dealt with in three phases. First of all, a fairly broad brush, non technical narrative of what appeared to take place.Then there follows a detailed technical description of what is known of the accident. Finally, the author turns all of this into a clear exposition of what actually, or probably, happened.<br />The writing style is clear and there is a lucid explanation of the facts. This is not a ghoulish or sensational account. The author is trying to explain what actually went wrong to cause each accident. I could see no technical or factual errors in these accounts, just a few typos and mis-spellings of some place names.<br />Those do not detract from the quality of the book and this series is clearly the best that deals with these topics.	2001-02-27

One day he discovers that there is a galaxy wide civilisation, unknown to humans and he has won a prize in the galactic lottery. He is taken away from the Earth and given his prize which turns out to be a taking but opinionated source of advice. Armed only with his prize, he sets out on a hilarious journey across the galaxy. On the way, he meets many strange people including the man responsible for building the planet Earth in the first place.<br />The prize's advice is not always much use. When Carmody is confronted by a Tyrannosaurus Rex, the prize can only suggest turning into a plant or singing hymns!<br />The book races along at a frantic pace. Every couple of pages brings a new situation and a lot of humour. Sheckley certainly knows how to keep his readers interested.<br />If you think that this sounds a lot like &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams, you are right but this book was written a decade earlier and it is funnier.<br />Sheckley has written many other novels and short stories and they are all very funny indeed so, if you enjoy this book, you will find a lot more to enjoy there.	2001-01-29

This book is a sadly pedestrian attempt to write about so dramatic a car.<br />This book repeats the standard formula for many such volumes. It contains a lot pretty photographs of the cars and a few simple words on the subject.<br />The photos are well presented, in good colour and on decent paper, but they are not really special. Mostly, they were obtained by tagging along at owners' club events or getting photographs from the factory. So we see lots of pictures of cars parked in grassy paddocks or being driven carefully on the track by their doting owners but nothing dramatic.<br />It is the same with the writing. There is a brief history of the company from its beginning to the end of the Countach era and a straightforward description of the car. The history conveys nothing of the drama in the company. The frequent trips to the financial brink, the strike prone labourforce or the Machiavellian twists and turns of the company's ownership.<br />Similarly, the description of the car tells you a lot about what it is like to look at or maybe to sit in or even to have one parked outside your house but the reader will never get an insight into what it is like to drive one of these cars hard over demanding roads.<br />If you want the latter, you should read the road tests that appeared in &quot;Car&quot; magazine in the seventies and eighties.<br />The book also contains some truly cringe inducing technical blunders. An example is the point where the author asserts that the V12 engine has a single cylinder head! The author also believes that the car's sump, clutch housing and gearbox case are part of the unsprung weight! These are by no means the only errors in the text. There are others along with contradictions and typos.<br />It's out of print and not really worth trying to find a copy. But, it shows up from time in shops that stock remaindered titles for a fraction of the original price and it is just about worth it then.	2001-01-17

It contains detailed information about almost all aspects of parallel port interfacing for PC systems.<br />The author covers the port from the nitty gritty of designing and building custom hardware to connect to the parallel port to the higher level protocols such as the IEEE standard for daisy chain negotiation on the port.<br />The book covers all of the different modes of operation including ECP and EPP as well as the original parallel port and the PS/2 or bidirectional port.<br />As well as the descriptions of these aspects of the parallel port the book includes a disk with code to access and drive the port from Windows Visual Basic programs.<br />The book is aimed squarely at the PC &amp; Windows world but it is applicable outside that environment. Many systems now include parallel ports that are register compatible with the PC parallel port from a programming point of view. More that that, the protocols that operate between the computer and the peripheral are standard and so something like the daisy chain protocol is relevant to any architecture that wants to use it.<br />My only criticism is the way in which some information is presented. It's not that anything is left out, but by way of an example, the IEEE standard document is a more readable description of the daisy chain protocol than this book.	2000-12-18
US	52719842	R3L8HM0VBOLM1S	002028361X	474715459	Deathbird Stories	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A great collection from SF's master of short fiction.	This collection groups nineteen of Ellison's stories dealing with subjects such as gods spirits and suchlike. In former times, people created numerous gods and spirits for just about every aspect of their lives. Gods for thunder the moon and the sea. Spirits and Ghosts living in caves, rivers etc. What if we still felt the need to invent and invoke such gods and spirits today? What would they be like? A god for machines? A spirit in a slot machine? A demon ruling over violent crime? These are the subjects that Ellison deals with in this collection of stories.<br />The book straddles the boundaries between science fiction, fantasy and horror and as such it will not satisfy SF purists but it does contain a number of very powerful stories. The opening tale, &quot;The Whimper of Whipped Dogs&quot; is a shocking and worrying  take on the cruelty of city violence. It is followed by &quot;Along the Scenic Route&quot; in which modern day knights in armour fight their jousts to the death on the public highway. Those two, along with &quot;Ernest and the MachineGod&quot;, &quot;Basilisk&quot; and &quot;Deathbird&quot; are my favourites but they are not the only stories to leap off the page and grab hold of your imagination. There are some weaker tales here too but they are outnumbered by the good ones.<br />I'd not recommend this as an introduction to Ellison. The anthology &quot;The Essential Ellison&quot; fills that role perfectly but, if you read and enjoyed that, you will like this book. If you like this book, I'd recommend Ellen Datlow's themed anthology &quot;Alien Sex&quot; though not her rather weak follow up.	2000-12-11

This book falls into the &quot;magic rules for success&quot; family of relationship enhancing books. No explanation of why things work or suggestions as to how to relate to them or build them into your life. Just a list of a hundred ideas for enhancing a marriage.<br />This is a slim, small format book and even that disguises its size. Ninety percent of the pages contain typically only about a dozen words each.<br />The key question has to be, how good are the one hundred tips in this book and how well can they be put to use? When faced with that question, this book does not perform particularly well. It will take you about an hour to read this book and, if you spent that time with a couple of chapters of one of the many John Gray Mars-Venus books, you would absorb more useful information.<br />Perhaps this book would help someone who strongly prefers to get their information from lists but even then, you must be prepared to spend time working out what questions are posed by this list and then answering the questions.<br />This book will not rescue a struggling relationship, it is perhaps of most use to those starting out in a new relationship as a checklist of things that you automatically do in the early days which you need to remember to keep on doing.	2000-11-26

She stayed there for a little under two years and this book is a series of essays about her time in the hospital.<br />It is not a diary and there is little in the way of continuity from one part of the book to another but this book is about the experiences of hospitalisation rather than being a narrative of a period of time.<br />The book opens a window on life as seen by a patient in a psychiatric hospital and what we see through the window is highly revealing. While the author and her fellow patients may have appeared to be behaving strangely, unpredictably or crazily, they had reasons for what they did that seemed fine to them at the time.<br />Less convincing are the parts where the author tries to talk about the rights and wrongs of sending her to the hospital. She seems to want to make the point that she was going through the difficult transition from being a girl to being a woman and was having a harder time than most people. She feels that this does not justify the way that she was sent to, and kept in, the hospital. That may be the case but, whereas the description of her time is the hospital is rightly one person's story, the rights and wrongs of her being sent there needs an objective input to be convincing.<br />The writing style is clear and direct and the whole book is very readable. While it is quite possible to read this book in one sitting, I'd not recommend that. You will get a lot more out of it if you slow down and take a couple of days to finish it and have time to think between every few chapters.	2000-11-16

Indeed, it goes  lot further than just being an introduction. It contains a wealth of detail and a lot of very useful references. If you want to find out about Unicode and see how it will affect your work, this is the book to get.<br />If you are going to be getting stuck in to some serious Unicode based development work, you will need the official standards for some of the fine detail but you should also have a copy of this book as well. In that case, I'd expect that you would refer to this book a lot more than the standard.<br />After a short preliminary section that talks about the need for a standard and the standardisation process the meat of the book deals in &quot;Part II&quot; with the detail of Unicode and, in &quot;Part III&quot; with some practical uses.<br />The author explains things like the various UTF encodings for Unicode in a clear and readable style. He also provides a very useful set of cameos of the support for Unicode in various operating systems, programming languages and applications. <br />There then follow a substantial set of appendices charting the Unicode codings, the character sets used and so on.<br />I do have one criticism of the book. Despite the appendices, there is still a lot of material in the text itself that really should also be in the appendices. I'm thinking of things such as charts of mappings and details about the standardisation process. This is a minor complaint though and the reader will easily be able to step around these sections while progressing through the book.	2000-10-31

The main protagonist, Kevin Senecal, is a college student forced to flee Earth. Working as a miner in the asteroid belt Senecal becomes mixed up in a plot involving vast riches, political intrigue and a beautiful girl.<br />Given the nature of the story and the protagonists, this book will appeal mostly to late teen and early twenties readers.<br />It is a well written and fast paced story. While not quite in the &quot;read in one sitting&quot; category it is a compelling read. The characters are all fairly well constructed given that the requirements for this type of story are not exactly strict.<br />If you like this book, of course, you should check out the author's other works but also have a look at the novels by Larry Niven. if you want something in the same style but with more substance try the collaborations between Niven and Pournelle.	2000-09-25

Because it is available in source  format, you can readily port MICO to a new environment.<br />MICO does the  business. You can use it for real applicatiions and not just as a toy. Even  if you are committed to using a commercial package, I'd suggest getting  hold of MICO as being the cheapest and easiest way of checking that your  application and chosen ORB can interoperated with another CORBA ORB.<br />As  is normally the case with open source software you can download it or  purchase a distribution. This package is the first MICO distribution to be  available. The book does contain a little more than the documentation that  comes with the downloadable version and that does just about justify the  purchase. However, you should be aware that this package has now been  superseeded by a differently titled package from the same authors. If you  do not have a copy of the distribution then you should get that version. If  you have this already and are considering the second, remember that it is  really just a new edition of this package and you most likely do not need  it.<br />The software on the CD-ROM is of course an older version of MICO but  it is still complete and as well as the source code, you get precompilied   binaries for a number of popular platforms. Of course, to use MICO, you  will need to have a C++ compiler but there is an advantage in having  binaries. If you are completely new to CORBA, you can at least run the  examples and know that any problems that you have are not the result of a  bad build of MICO.<br />The only reason that I'm not awarding this higher  marks to this book is that it has now been superseeded.	2000-09-15

I am  always a little cynical about publishers who bring out a second edition of  a book under a different title and that is the case here. The book is an  expanded and updated edition of &quot;MICO is CORBA&quot; by the same  authors.<br />But that should not be seen as a strong criticism. MICO is a  great product and this book does contain significant information that is  not in the online documentation. Of course, as is normally the case with  this type of product, there are now newer versions of the software than on  the enclosed CD-ROM but the code in this package works just fine. Serious  users will expect to download the latest software from the official MICO  web site as well.<br />The book assumes that you know C++ and it does contain  a small intoroducton to CORBA. However, do not imagine that this is a  tutorial to designing and developing CORBA systems. You will want a copy of  something like &quot;Advanced CORBA programming with C++&quot; by Henning  and Vinoski at your side as you develop your application.	2000-09-15

This is the third book in the Monks of St.Titus Bridge series. As with the  earlier works, the book follows the exploits of the Bridge playing monks in  England and also, it picks up on the adventures of their missionary outpost  in Africa. As usual, the format concentrates on play rather than on  bidding. Rather than being presented as pure puzzles, the play unfolds in a  narrative style. This is doubly useful. There is an opportunity to treat  each hand as a not too serious double dummy problem but also, it is quite  possible to just follow the narrative and allow the authors to expose the  solution.<br />A book such as this can be quite dry but the characters and  situations spice things up with a good degree of wit. Even if you have read  none of the other books in the series you will quickly become familiar with  the characters and their foibles. This levening explains why these books  are able to appeal to readers with a range of abilities from beginners so  callow as to present this reviewer with an opportunity for victory up to  those who deign to partner me once a year as a special favour.<br />The  authors are to be commended on one matter in particular. The books in this  series lose none of their sparkle even after you have read all of them more  than once. They are very good indeed.<br />I wholeheartedly recommend this  book for any bridge player and it would also make a great present for any  bridge playing friend.	2000-09-01

Seldom has a sequel fallen as far short of the standards set by its  predecessor as does this anthology which  is the follow up to the highly  regarded Alien Sex. It contains 18 stories, 16 of which were new for this  collection in 1996. The other four stories go back as far as the sixties.  There are also two poems.<br />The dominant theme in this anthology is  prostitution. Almost half of the stories deal with this topic in one form  or another. By contrast, in the original anthology, there is a much greater  variety of subject matter.<br />No more than half of the stories in here merit  inclusion in an anthology and the others range from poor to utterly  dreadful.<br />I can recommend Brian Stableford's &quot;The House of  Mourning&quot; and Elizabeth Hand's &quot;In the Month of Athyr&quot; as  standing out from the rest but of the other 18 pieces, I awarded more lower  rankings than I have ever done for any other anthology that I have ever  read.<br />If there is one way in which  collection is like &quot;Alien  Sex&quot; it is the fact that this is not a book of of erotic writing. I  doubt that any reader will feel aroused by the content of the book. That is  not a criticism, it's just that some of the write ups on the jacket are  misleading.<br />If you like the general idea of a collection of stories about  alien sex, you should buy &quot;Alien Sex&quot; from the same editor. That  is a far better book.	2000-08-17

It is set in a US in which what remains of the population is confined largely to the coasts and separated by a wild and dangerous  interior. When the population on the East coast is threatened by a deadly  disease, the only hope is for a medical supplies to be transported  overland. The book follows one man, unreformed biker Hell Tanner who sets  out to cross the badlands.<br />As a setting for a novel this is not very  promising. However, the author brings a huge amount of invention and  narrative skill to bear and the result is a page turner. Of course, you  know from the start that Hell Tanner will reluctantly accept the assignment  and that he will face almost certain defeat on the way.<br />Despite that  knowledge, you want to keep reading this book because the story is just so  well put together. For me, one of the marks of a really good book is the  vividness of the images that it creates in my head. By that test, this book  was very good indeed.<br />If you like SF adventure stories, then track down a  copy of this book and you will not be disappointed.	2000-07-25

This book is a compilation of material from earlier Dilbert cartoons rearranged by topic. The cartoons show Dilbert and his weird collection of co-workers in a range of different situations.<br />It will not be of interest  to Dilbert fans who already have the books from which these cartoons are  taken. However, seen as a &quot;Best Of&quot; book, it is worthwhile. The  actual selection of material is very good and it certainly shows the humour  of Dilbert at its best.<br />If you do already have all of the books in the  Dilbert series, I'd suggest buying this one as a gift for a friend who is  not familiar with Scott Adams work. It makes a great introduction, showing  what Dilbert is all about.<br />If you are not familiar with Dilbert and want  to find out what it is all about, then this book is a good place to start.  Just accept that, if you get hooked and buy the other books, you will then  have a copy of this book that you do not really need. If that happens, no  problem, gift wrap it and send it as a present to a friend.<br />My only real  gripe about the book is that its nature is not made clear on the cover. Not  making clear that this is a &quot;best of&quot; collection seems to suggest  that the author, or his publishers, view the readership as little smarter  than some of the characters in the books.	2000-07-22
US	52719842	R1HKBR44DI5G4N	0441005225	336316926	Clones (Ace Science Fiction)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A good read.	This is another of the themed anthology series put together by Dozois and Dann. This time, as it says on the cover, the nine stories are (mostly) about clones. The collections that I have read so far in this series have  varied between good and very good and this book hit the spot too. It did  have a couple of weak stories but the stronger ones more than made up for  that.<br />Of course, the stories are all available elsewhere originally  published in various places between 1964 and 1990 but, unless you are an  avid reader of all the magazines, most of the content will be new to you.  Certainly, they were all new to me. As usual, the editors add to the  anthology with informed comment on the authors. While that may not be so  necessaary for the established big names, some of the authors will be less  familiar and it is great to use the editors notes as a starting point for  further reading.<br />The stories that I like the most here are the ones that  explore the area of what it might be like to be a clone. How will clones  differ from the rest of us. How will society treat them? Will a clone have  full human rights? &quot;Nine Lives&quot; by Ursula K LeGuin, &quot;The  Phantom of Kansas&quot; by John  Varley and &quot;Where Late the Sweet  Birds Sang&quot; by Kate Wilhelm all made interesting points about  this.<br />The focus is on bio-tech rather than hard science so the book will  not appeal to all sections of the SF community but is an interesting  anthology. If you enjoy this book, you will of course want to follow up  some of the editor's suggetions for further reading. Also, of course, it's  worth checking out the other anthologies from the same editors. My  favourite is Nanotech. If you'd like to read more on a similar vein, then  check out the Ellen Datlow &quot;Alien Sex&quot; anthologies.	2000-07-19

I find that this book is an absolutely essential part of my kitchen. Not  for specific recipes but for general information and advice on cullinary  technique.<br />If you want a book in which every page has a glossy photo of  an end result and a simple to follow recipe in big type and breathless  prose then you should look elsewhere.<br />I like this book because, whatever  I go out and buy, I can look here and find half a dozen ways to cook it and  a number of specific recipe suggestions. I then use this as a starting  point to my own ideas.<br />Of course, there are individual recipes in here  which you can follow, as written, with great success but to give you a  flavour of the book I'll describe a few chapters.<br />The chapter on savoury  rice and other grains is thirteen pages long. It includes sixteen recipies  and more variations on each. In addition there are four pages that describe  all of the types of rice that are available together with cooking notes and  techniques.<br />The chapter on meat covers not just recipes but advice on  buying, selecting good meat and carving it.<br />Everthing is covered in the  same way in simple, consise but comprehensive form. In addition, there are  extensive chapters on general kitchen technique and the use of individual  ingredients.<br />Having this book in the kitchen is a bit like having your  favourite aunt, the one who knows everything, available, on call ready to  help all the time.<br />My wife tells me that I am a wonderful cook. I'm not,  I'm just a man who owns a copy of this book and who reads the relevant  pages every time that I prepare to be Mr Chef.<br />There is also a  non-culinary section at the end which includes chapters on diet, first aid,  health care and (oh yes indeed) what to do if introduced to the Queen of  England! With the exception of things like that last item, the advice is  good and of interest to most people.<br />It's a great book and every  household should have a copy.	2000-07-08

Set in a future, post apocalypse, Europe, it follows the fortunes of a group of astronauts who have left Earth expecting to return a few years later but, due to a  miscalculation in time dilation, they arrive many years later than they  expected. They discover that the world has changed greatly and not for the  better. Due to some cataclysmic event, civilisation, the whole world over  appears to have gone back to an era thousands of years more primative than  the world that they left behind.<br />The travellers attempt to bring some  semblance of order and civilisation to a world that is a mixture of  primitive savagery and old artifacts. Returning to England, through a  derelict channel tunnel, they attempt to form and civilise a community. Can  they succeed and turn their new found followers into a reborn civilisation  of will they just be a glitch on a downward spiral?<br />This book takes a  bleak and deeply pessimistic view of the human spirit. It is not a  comfortable read but it is well written and it makes an interesting tale.  Parts are rather weak and too &quot;off pat&quot; to be convincing and this  diminishes the ultimate impact of what would otherwise be one of the most  upsetting future histories that I have read.<br />The author's rather flacid  logic for the fall of civilisation is the worst part of the book. It would  have been a better story if he had not felt the need to address this issue  which is not central to the main story line.<br />I give this a recommendation  as a good, if not great book.	2000-07-05

Unlike much SF of that era, they have not lost their edge.<br />In part, this is down to Ellison's literary style which was head  and shoulders above the majority of SF at that time. Thus today, when  editors demand better writing, these stories can still satisfy. The other  reason is that Ellison has an uncanny vision of the future which does not  easily get outdated by the events of a few decades.<br />The stories contain  lots of new ideas and the author uses the flexibility of the SF format to  good effect.<br />This highlight must of course be &quot;Repent,  Harlequin!&quot; said the Ticktockman which tells of a world rigidly  controlled with everyone forced to conduct their affairs to maximise the  efficiency of society. I think that this is one of the finest SF shorts  ever written and it is certainly the best known of all the stories  here.<br />Having praised that story, I should say that, with the exception of  the final tale, &quot;Deeper than the Darkness&quot;, I really liked  everything here. They range from the sorrowful &quot;Bright Eyes&quot; to  the wryly funny story &quot;The Crackpots&quot;.	2000-06-19

The book is presented as a collection of  individual or grouped hands and there is no need to tackle these books in  sequence. The hands are interesting and the presentation is very funny  indeed.<br />The material originally appeared as a series of articles, written  by David Bird, in various Bridge magazines. Terence Reese is credited with  adding some polish and a famous name, to the book form.<br />The great appeal  of this book is that the characters seem so real. Of course, you do not  meet that many monks at the local bridge club, but you do meet people just  like the  Abbot and so on.<br />By setting part of the book with two monks  working as misisonaries, the authors also have an opportunity to introduce  a fair share of the zany too though.<br />The highlight of this book is  the  section in Africa where the missionaries win the trials to represent Upper  Bhumpopo in the African championships and then travel to Tunis to play as  internationals and have a shot at qualifying for the Bermuda Bowl. It's  very funny and the hands are also interesting.<br />The hands are well chosen  and the play problems presented all fit to the characters of the players  involved. Often this gives a clue if you are trying to solve the problems  before reading about them.<br />Any Bridge player with a sense of humour will  love this book.	2000-06-15

This time, the cartoons first appeared in the early Eighties.<br />The main tale in this book is of the mishaps of Duke and Honey as they try to run a boat charter operation. When  running drugs and refugees doesn't work out, Duke takes a party of tourists  on a trip to the Falklands to watch the British blockade. As usual Duke's  approach to life is outrageous and totally lacking in shame but somehow,  you have to like his directness.<br />In the meantime, we see the rest of the  cast coping with the early years of the Reagan era. The humour is sharp  and, despite the fact that many of the themes are now well in the past,  this book is still readable today.	2000-06-11

The setting is a huge, cylindrical building that towers above the earth. Most of society exists inside the building but those who are outside society, on the edge,  live on the outside of the building, on the &quot;Vertical&quot;.<br />The  novel's protagonist, Ny Axxter lives on this wall and tries to make a  living as a freelance artist working with video and graffex. One day, he  has what appears to be a stroke of good fortune and he thinks that he is on  the verge of making it into the big time as a major artist.<br />At this  point, his world starts to fall to pieces and he discovers that reality is  not what he, and everyone else thought and that the major players in his  world now want him out of the way.<br />While many parts of the world are  unexplained, Jeter throws in enough in the way of technical details to make  this hard SF and not fantasy. The writing style is very sharp.<br />Jeter is  regarded by many as an heir to the mantle of the great P.K.Dick and this  book is worthy of that regard. I always think that a sign of good writing  is the quality of the pictures inside my head as I read and, on the  measure, this was very good indeed.<br />Farewell Horizontal is a gripping  read and I highly recommended it.	2000-06-07

The authors start from two straightforward premises:<br />Men and women are very different in the way that they act, react, think and feel.<br />These differences are the inevitable consequence of our biology.<br />The first of  these is a lot less controversial than the second and, perhaps the book  would have ruffled fewer feathers if the authors had stuck to the first  premise. However, the caveman-cavewoman analogies do help them to  illustrate their points.<br />The book is well put together in a pretty  light-hearted style. While not being unputdownable, it is an easy read. One  quibble though has to be that, after a while, many of the jokes seem to be  a little tedious.<br />As well as illustrating the differences between men and  women, the book gives examples of how these lead to conflict and  misunderstandings. Their advice is pretty much to learn about the  differences and grin and bear it.<br />Of course, the book goes over much the  same ground as the Mars-Venus stuff but, it does so at a somewhat simpler  and, some would say, superficial level. If you get to the end of Mars-Venus  and absorb what it says then this book is not for you. On the other hand,  If you found M-V to be too heavy and a bit pretentious then the  lighthearted and more direct style of this book could be just what you  need.<br />At the end of the book, there is a substantial list of references  and further reading. This varies from other popular psychology books to  research papers which provide the scientific backing for the authors ideas.  Unfortunately, they just list these with no comment and no attempt to  categorise the items. This means that the list is of little use to a reader  interested in exploring further topics or referring to some of the research  on which the authors ideas depend.	2000-06-05

It takes a view on the very existance of our universe. How it may have come into being and what there may be beyond it in time and space.<br />Of course, these matters  are not the subject of simple experiments but it is remarkable that our  understanding of nature allows such speculation.<br />This book is aimed at a  non-technical audience and the overall style is clear and the arguments  lucid.<br />The author starts with an introduction that explains our universe  as it has been understood through the main developments of physics in the  last one hundred years. The sections on gravitation effects, ranging from  stellar collapse to massive black holes missing mass and expansion were  presented with great clarity.<br />However, if you are looking for a book that  talks about &quot;Before the Beginning&quot;, you may just find yourself  wondering why you read the first nine chapters. They are a good,  non-technical introduction but they are about our universe from the big  bang to the present time.<br />The last 40% of the book actually contains  material hinted at in the title. The author makes the point that our  universe is remarkable in the way that it is fit for human life. He then  links this observation to the current thinking about the origins of the  universe.<br />Perhaps, our universe is one of many. Very, very many and this  one just happens to suit the development of life but there may be many  universes &quot;out there&quot; that are still born in the sense that they  cannot support life.<br />Reese explains how space time inflation may lead to  universes with different laws of physics and how universes may spawn new  universes through the formation of black holes. At the end of this  arguement, he talks about the &quot;Anthropomorphic Reasoning&quot; by  which we can understand this. These ideas are very speculative and are  disputed by many others. Reese achieves a good balance by writing aboutthese disputes.<br />If you want a book that will give you the current state  of the art view of cosmology together with some fascinating speculation  about fuuture developments then this is just the job.<br />I can only level a  small number of criticisms at the book. I suspect that most of the target  audience will already be familiar with the first 60% of the book so,  perhaps, it would have been better to condense that material. The  &quot;Further Reading&quot; list at the end just has a collection of titles  and authors with no expansion on the contents of these references. Some  more information here would be a huge help to readers wondering what to  look at next.	2000-06-02

My personal favourite in  this collection is Dilbert's discovery that the Moon is populated by the  women who love engineers but really, the whole collection is great.<br />These  cartoons age very well compared to some strips in the newspapers and they  certianly stand several readings.

This book is part of a formidable series of themed anthologies, some of which are very good indeed, produced  by these two editors.<br />Each story here is accompanied by a short piece of  biographical information about the author with some comments and  recommendations about that author's other works. So, if you find something  that you like here, you will be able to follow this up to find some further  reading.<br />There were two things that I did not like about this book. The  first was the number of typos. These looked like the old problem of running  a spell checker and selecting the auto fix option rather than checking  manually. The second thing was that too many of the stories were just a  rehashing of the ideas in older science fiction stories.<br />My favourite  stories here were &quot;Trapalanda&quot; by Charles Sheffield and &quot;The  Secret Place&quot; by Richard McKenna. The former is a story about a  strange discovery in a remote part of the southern hemisphere. It has a lot  of atmosphere and just begs a follow up. The latter, is a tale about  imagination and it carries similar delights to the author's best known  story &quot;Casey Agonistes.&quot;<br />For me though, these two stories did  not make up for the fact the several others in the collection were weak and  unconvincing. If you are looking for a good example of a themed anthology,  I'd suggest checking out &quot;Nanotech&quot; by the same editors.	2000-05-22

The Doonsbury cartoons are one the finest examples of modern satire. Unlike many such series, the characters age and grow and many of them even mature. This brings an extra dimension to the series that is lacking in  other cartoons.<br />In this book, originally drawn in 1985 and 1986 we see  Trudeau's family of characters grown up from their college days and forming  careers and becoming homemakers as well as dealing with the contemporary  issues of the Reagan era.

If you are irritated by the idea of a book that tries really hard to be all about funny little Martians being blown away by the sheer coolness of CORBA on the internet then do not touch this book. It's not clever, it's not funny and unlike John Gray's books, it does not  serve a purpose of illustrating any particular concepts.<br />Next, a word  about the title. It is misleading. The book is about CORBA applications  distributed over the internet to form what the authors refer to as the  Object Web. If you want a book to tell you about using CORBA in another  contect, then this is the wrong book.<br />The book is split into four parts  with a recommendation that reading parts 1 and 4 will give a non-technical  introduction to CORBA and that parts 2 and 3 form more technical material  which may be skipped.<br />Well, if that is the case, why not put the fourth  part after the first and before the two technical sections?<br />The  non-technical sections of the book contain little other than lists of  suppliers and a claim that the web will soon be based almost entirely on  CORBA. The introduction to CORBA that they give is inferior to that in most  other CORBA books and now out of date<br />The sections that are claimed to be  technical are not. They are really just introductory concepts that are  necessary before embarking on a book on CORBA programming. Having said  that, they do provide a better introduction than many dedicated programming  books.<br />Finally, the index is very poor. When I tried to use it, I found  more entries were in error than correct and I gave up on it.	2000-04-27

We now know that this was caused by a fairly prosaic programming error that was further  compounded by a lack of testing before new software was installed. At the  time, this was not known and many people involved in law enforcement in the  US feared that the attack was the result of the activities of a group of  computer hackers.<br />These circumstances led to an extraordinary sequence of  events. The authorities launched action against many in and on the  periphery of the hacking world. As is normally the case in these  situations, not everyone targetted was involved in the activities against  which the actions were directed.<br />Bruce Sterling, well known as a modern  SF author became aware of this and was spurred into investigating the  investigation and writing a book about the events of the Hacker Crackdown.  This book is the result.<br />It is a very fine book. The writing is a lucid  as you would expect from a professional author but the investigation too is  a fine piece of work. As well as detailing the events, the author tells the  story of the people involved in the operation. As a result, we get a  picture of the players on both sides as well as the game.<br />Of course,  several years on, many of the technical details of the story seem quaint  but this does not detract from the fact that the book tells an interesting  story very well. It also raises a number of questions about the  vulnerabilities arising from the internet era and the way in which society  attempts to defend itself.	2000-04-24

This collection contains seven stories, all previously published in magazines between 1993 and 1998. One story, &quot;Big Jelly&quot; was co-authored with Rudy Rucker.<br />I liked this anthology a lot despite the  fact that a couple of the stories were rather weak. Some of the stories  seem to have been written by extrapolating current events into the future  and these, like &quot;The Littlest Jackal&quot; are the weakest in the  collection. Also, in that story, the author mis-places Helsinki north of  the Arctic circle and so he has the sun not setting in the summer, that was  just sloppy writing. The stories such as &quot;Maneki Neko&quot; (my  favourite) and the &quot;Deep Eddy&quot; series, that extrapolate  technology are the ones that make the book worth while. In these,  Sterling's wry view of the way that technology might change our world is  both thought provoking and funny.<br />The last three stories are all set in  the same world and they follow the largely unrelated exploits of a group of  people living on the edge of a highly technological society. I felt as  though the author was taking some of the people that he met while writing  &quot;The Hacker Crackdown&quot; and then dropping them into the middle of  the 21st century. These are three great stories.	2000-04-07

The first part is a largely non-technical introduction to the subject. If you want to know what Frame-Relay is, why it is the way that it  is, what it is meant to be used for and how it might fit into a networking  system, then you will get all of that here.<br />The second part is a  technical description of the protocol. It goes into  enough detail to allow  you not just to understand the protocol but, if you have the coding and  design skills, to write your own F-R stack and get it interworking with  other networks.<br />I did that using this book as my reference. In the course  of that work, I spotted one small error in the book. One bit in the  Frame-Relay header field is mis-described but apart from that, it was a  great help.<br />Not only is the technical content spot on but it is well  presented. The layout and diagrams make sense and the English is clear and  readable.	2000-03-29

Denied electability by his background, he works in  the campaign team of a disintegrating politician while pursuing his own  agenda involving the control of a government research base.<br />All through  this, his world teeters on the brink of collapse as corrupt politicians and  the onslaught of new technologies pile up waves of problems.<br />This setting  has the potential to be a really remarkable novel  but ultimately, it  fails. None of the characters are satisfactorily explained. Too often, they  select a course of action which, while necessary to the direction of the  plot, seems not to fit in with the picture painted of their ambitions and  motivations.<br />Finally, the story falls into an all too common trap in  modern SF. It is almost as if the author realises that he has nearly  reached the books allotted quota of words without having ended the  narrative. So, the reader is presented with a frenzied winding up of the  plot to reach the author's desired conclusion.<br />Die hard Sterling fans  will find it essential but he is capable of producing much finer work that  this.	2000-03-13

Interzone is the UK's premiere SF magazine and it can certainly hold its head up in any company. So, this  book has the makings of a good anthology. Many of the authors will be well  known to SF fans around the world.<br />Perhaps I was expecting too much but,  for me at least, the book did not live up to expectations. Some of the  stories were really good but too many were mediocre and one or two were  very hard going.<br />The two stories that stood out the most were right at  the end of the book. &quot;Human Waste&quot; by Mary Gentle and &quot;Cyril  the Cyberpig&quot; by Eugene Byrne. These two tales could hardly be more  different. The first was a ghastly reminder of the desire or perhaps even  the need for cruelty that can drive humans. It reminded me very much of  &quot;All My Darling Daughters&quot; by Connie Willis which you can find in  the first of Ellen Datlow's &quot;Alien Sex&quot; anthologies. Eugene  Byrne's tale on the other hand is a sort of &quot;Robocop&quot; satire  which had me laughing out loud several times.<br />I rate this as three stars.  It's worth it if you like shorter SF a lot but if you will only read one  anthology this year, then you should really find a better one. A real  &quot;Best of Interzone&quot; could have been much better than this.	2000-03-03

It is not so far fetched to believe that the same might be the case for at least some alien species.  But, this area is not one that has featured widely in SF writings. Around  half of the stories here are published for the first time in this  collection.<br />This is not a collection of erotic writing, indeed it is more  disturbing and sometimes funny than arousing.<br />Horror fiction has a much  stronger tradition of covering sexual matters and some of the stories here  wander along the boundary of the two genres.<br />Particularly &quot;The First  Time&quot; by K.W.Jeter. This gruesome story is not an easy read but it is  also one of the strongest in the collection.<br />&quot;All My Darling  Daughters&quot; by Connie Willis and Leigh Kennedy's &quot;Her Furry  Face&quot; also dwell on aspects of the human condition that you wouldn't  want to discuss with your mother. Nonetheless, they are good stories that  use the &quot;alien&quot; setting to good effect.<br />The collection is not  confined to such serious, or even disturbing material. There are some  genuinely funny stories here too. Especially the classic &quot;How's the  Nightlife on Cissalda&quot; by Harlan Ellison and &quot;Man of Steel, Woman  of Kleenex&quot; by Larry Niven.<br />Many of the stories deal with the theme  of aliens as a sexual threat to humans. From lighthearted stories such as  Pat Cadigan's &quot;Roadside Rescue&quot; to the macabre &quot;Dancing  Chickens&quot; by Edward Bryant.<br />I'd rate about three quarters of the  stories in here as being above agerage or better. A couple were rather weak  and the book would have been better had they been left out but, overall,  this is a good collection.	2000-02-28
US	52719842	R18UH4DO1YNCMY	0006476201	278394270	Flux	Books	3	8	9	N	N	Promising but, disappointing	The most striking thing about this novel is the setting. The events take place within a thin layer just below the surface of a neutron star.<br />Somehow, life is possible within this environment and the main  characters are a tiny race of beings created by humans to be able to live  in the environment.<br />Within this world, the author creates a preindustrial  society whose attitudes bear an odd resemblance to those on the planet  Norfolk in Peter Hamilton's &quot;Night's Dawn&quot; series. Yes, despite  the setting, the characters are really taken from pastoral England. Indeed,  Baxter's heroine Dura and several of the other characters might have walked  out of a novel by Thomas Hardy.<br />The novel follows the adventures of Dura  as she starts out trying to save her small clan and ends trying to save the  world and perhaps even the universe itself.<br />A good story, some  interesting characters and a great setting. So, what could go wrong with  that?<br />Well, despite all of this promise, the novel finally failed to be  complete because of the way that the ending was handled. Suddenly, new  technologies, situations and relationnships were introduced to tie up all  of the dangling threads and bring things to a conclusion. I almost had the  feeling the the author suddenly decided that it was time to get it all  wrapped up and off to the publishers.	2000-02-28

US	52719842	R33DRGYTUL54GF	0671878522	652434	4: The New Hugo Winners IV	Books	3	14	15	N	N	A mixed bunch but worth it on the whole	This book contains the winners of three of the categories of Hugo awards (novella, novelette and short story) from the years 1992, 1993 and 1994.<br />Most of the stories here were first published in Asimov's science  fiction magazine. Thus, regular subscribers to that will find little new in  this collection.<br />I felt that the three short stories were not  particularly good.<br />The first, &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; by Geoffrey  Landis is traditional SF involving an astronaut stranded on the Moon. I  felt that this could have been written thirty or forty years earlier and,  after the first four pages, it was simple to see how the rest of the story  would progress.<br />Only one writer, Connie Willis, featured twice and her  two short stories were, for me at least, the weakest in the  collection.<br />While none of them stands out as being exceptionally good,  the longer works do manage to redeem the collection. The first novelette,  &quot;Gold&quot; by Asimov is not particularly memorable but the other two,  &quot;The Nutcracker Coup&quot; and &quot;Georgia on my Mind&quot; together  with the three novellas, &quot;Beggars in Spain&quot;, &quot;Barnacle Bill  the Spacer&quot; and &quot;Down in the Bottomlands&quot; tip the  balance.<br />All five of these were interesting stories in settings ranging  from contemporary Earth through space adventure to alien worlds and races.  TNC and BiS also had something interesting to say beyond their  narrative.<br />In summary then, a readable book which is worth the price of  admission but there are better collections around.	2000-02-03
US	52719842	R2CZ8OS5F4UFKE	0233988971	619833785	101 Further Uses for a John Major	Books	1	0	0	N	N	Flogging a dead horse	This second book demonstrates that, while it may be possible to think of 202 uses for a John Major, it is not possible to think of 202 funny uses.<br />The first book in this series picked up on the very funny book,  &quot;101 uses for a dead cat&quot; together with the British public's  disenchantment with their then Prime Minister.<br />The second book has no  novelty appeal in that way and the ideas are really laboured and, quite  frankly, not funny.	2000-02-03
US	52719842	R2V6H3IK1FS8ME	0684842963	202343708	50 Short Science Fiction Tales	Books	4	7	7	N	N	Some treats from the past.	If you like really short SF stories then you should read this book. It contains a lot of them and they are good. They are also short. The book packs fifty stories plus introductions etc into less than 300 pages.<br />The  collection was first issued in the early sixties and the stories themselves  come from the forties and fifties. SF is a rapidly changing medium and,  with an average age of half a century, many of these stories now show their  age. But that does not really detract from their quality. After all, this  collection features the greatest SF talents of the era.<br />If forced to pick  a favourite from the collection, I'd choose &quot;The Available Data on the  Worp Reaction&quot; by Lion Miller but there are so many good tales in here  that naming one alone is an injustice to the others.	2000-02-02
US	52719842	R17EDABIYIFD8X	0316107107	279057088	Bloom County "Loose Tails"	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Berke Breathed's Glory Days!	Bloom County had something special, more than just the jokes. As you read the strip, you cannot help but get involved with the characters.<br />Bloom County fans don't just laugh at the jokes, they care about Opus and the rest. Even Steve Dallas, the ruthless but inept lawyer, wins  sympathy.<br />The humour tends to the wit and satire end of the cartoon  spectrum with only occasional bursts of slapstick. The satire is aimed  mainly at lifestyles and steroetypes rather than current events which makes  it still sharp as it ages.<br />It is a very male-centric book. Female  characters are introduced in order to give the main players a romantic  interlude or to prop up some situation.<br />Bloom County was one of the best  cartoons of its time and Loose Tails is a real gem.	2000-01-27

This is a book about air accidents written from the point of view of the crash investigation agencies. It describes the investigations and the conclusions reached and subsequent events.<br />This means that it is not  really a book about air accidents but, neither is it a book about air  accident investigators. The book does describe some aspects of the  investigations but it does not really analyse the work of the  investigators.<br />It is really a collection of annecdotal accounts of a  number of accidents that were featured on an associated TV series.<br />The  books title is rather misleading. Nowhere does the author attempt to say  &quot;Why air safety is no accident&quot; rather, he just reports on the  investigations.<br />I do have one major caveat about the factual accuracy of  the book. The author's description of part of the Tenerife two-jumbo  accident is at odds with the other descriptions that I have read. In  particular, he states that there was some confusion about what the FO of  the KLM aircraft said as it commenced its take off roll. The author states  that it was not clear from the tape whether the FO said &quot;we are at  take off&quot; or &quot;we are taking off.&quot;<br />According to other  reports of this accident, the FO clearly said &quot;we are at take  off&quot; but they made the point that, in the grammar of his native Dutch,  the meaning of that phrase is the same as the meaning of the English phrase  &quot;we are taking off.&quot; Indeed, the author fails to appreciate that  this accident led to a major change in the approved phraseology for radio  communications between pilots and controllers.<br />On the positive side,  desipte its shortcomings, the book is interesting to read and I certainly  enjoyed it.	2000-01-03
US	52719842	R1GL3ULT22EQTB	0441005853	803924967	Nanotech	Books	4	17	18	N	N	A good read	A readable, thought provoking series of stories on the theme of nanotechnology. Eight short stories, one poem and a novella. No bad stories and one truely great one.<br />I liked this book a lot. I had only read one of  the stories before in a magazine anthology. The others were new to  me.<br />The highlight of the book is &quot;We were out of our minds with  joy&quot; by David Marusek. This story has enough in the way of ideas and  development potential to spawn a novel. The price is worth paying for this  novella alone. Indeed, at the price, it seems like a bargain!<br />While  Marusek is still an emerging talent, other authors featured here such as  Bear, Egan, di Fillipo and Baxter will be more familiar.<br />At the end of  the book, the editors add a list of further reading on the same subject. I  will be following up a number of their suggestions.	2000-01-03

These are then followed by his personal, rather  &quot;folksy&quot; advice.<br />The style will not appeal to all readers and  especially, it may not be so effective at helping a relationship once  problems have become entrenched.<br />However, as a book to read before this  happens, it is very useful. I'd stronlgy recommend it to anyone in the  early stages of a mixed relationship. It will prepare you for some of the  trials ahead and you will be much better equipped to deal with them.	1999-12-23
