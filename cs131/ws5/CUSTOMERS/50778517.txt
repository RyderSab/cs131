And the difficulty inherent in writing what is truly a 3000+ page novel cannot be overemphasized.  For the most part Willaims can be said to have succeeded.  The first three books are excellent and the fourth starts off equally well.  But the final volume's conclusion fails to live up to the series' promises and mars the entire work.<br />This the concluding volume has a number of problems mostly centering around the last fourth of the book.  One particularly odd flaw is Williams' decision to introduce a major new subplot relating to Mr. Sellars at the end of the book.  This new development has no impact on the story and is too huge to include simply as an interesting detail.  Williams could have written an entire new novel around this one subplot. However this is a minor point since even though this subplot takes up too much of the book it doesn't really take up that much and it does little to subtract from the enjoyment of the series.<br />A far greater problem is that Williams is unable to bring the various story threads together in a fitting conclusion.  He cetainly tries, even trying to get Christabel and Cho-Cho in on the climax, but in the end the situation seems to resolve itself.  The heroes seem unimportant and I was left wondering why they were needed in the book.  Certainly the characters' stories had been very interesting.  And there is no literery reason why everyone in a story has to play some important part in the conclusion.  But _Otherland_ had seemed to be building to a climax in which Paul and the other heroes would be the champions.  The previous volumes had put a lot of emphasis on the angel and the feathers she kept giving Paul and in the third volume that angel puts a lot of significance on the mountain of black glass and the need of the heroes to climb it themselves.<BR>This book suggest that Orlando is important in the plans of the other.  But in the end neither the angel, the feathers, Paul, the black mountain, Orlando, or any of the others seem very important.<br />Also after the climax the book doesn't end.  The last chapters are a bit tedious and unimportant, and Williams seems to be setting up a possible sequel rather than completeing this story.<br />I hate that this review seems overly negative. _Sea of Silver Light_ still has a lot going for it.  Perhaps most imortantly it doesn't ruin the other books in the series.  Many huge series like this fall completely apart in the later volumes and in the end none of the books seem any good.  I can still recommend the series as a whole.<br />But beyond that I can also reccomend this particular book.  Though you certainly shouldn't read this book without reading the first three, this book is none the less good on its own merits.  It is well written, very interesting, it continues to explore a spectacularly fascinating fantasy world (even if this volume shows some signs of padding, particularly the Old West simulation), and Willaims has an amazing sense of what people are really like and the characters and human institutions in this book tend to behave in very realistic and beleivable ways even when they are being absurd.  I particularly enjoyed the NETFEED/NEWS bits at the begging of each chapter (in this and the previous volumes).<br />The only exception to his good character developement are some of the minor characters in this volume, particularly T4B and Florimal.  In previous volumes these character had very little development which was fine.  Williams can't make every character a major character.  In this volume Willaims tries to develope these charcaters more but does a surprisingly one dimensional job of it.<br />One highlight of this volume is the back story explaining how Paul came to be involved with Jongleur and his relationship to Jongleur's duaghter.  The book also has some surprises about Sellars and the true nature of the Other. <br />Again I hope this review hasn't been too negative.  _Sea of Silver Light_ is still a good book.  And it is a good conclusion the the _Otherland_ series, but it is also a somewhat disappointing conclusion.	2001-10-16

Martins, _A Song of Ice and Fire_ series keeps getting better.  While other epic fantasy writers drag stories on without end, Martin writes and epic that I don't want to end. _A Storm of Swords_ is a very big book and would be completely incomprehensible to anyone who hasn't read to first two books.  And some reader find it too violent.  But to me it is simply realistic.  And the reality of a fuedal society with Seven Kingdoms sharing an island and united under a high king is that there is going to be a lot of violence, a lot of treachery, and a lot of suffering. And it is the realism that makes this such an incredile series.<br />Martin's universe feels more historical than fantastical.  Though there are familiar fantasy elements like dragons and magic these take a back seat to human characters with complex personalites and relationships.  One of Martin's strongest points is his ability to create multifacited charcters: bad guys who do good things or become sympathetic, good buys who do bad things, selfish characters that behave nobly, and generous characters who are forced to think of themselves.<br />The story itself takes a number of twist.  And the very interesting back story of how the former royal house fell and the significance of Eddard's sister continue to unfold throughout this volume, but the mystery remains far from revealed. The current events in _A Strom of Swords_ center aound the esculating conflicts as various kings fight for the Iorn throne, and Dany still in exile attepts to raise her own army.  It's all very excting and thare are a number of suprises along the way.  Highly recommended but only after you've read the first two.	2001-02-10

It is populated by those members of our society who were forgotten and fell through the cracks, those who were born there, and those who accidently came in contact with it and once touched by it could never be a part a our world again. <br />The hero of &quot;Neverwhere&quot; is the last.  Once he stops to help an injured woman that his fiance is almost incapable of seeing he finds that no one knows him, no one remebers hims, and no one can even see him unless he purposefully gets their attention.  Only others like himself even knows he exist.<br />It turns out the girl he saved is royalty in this otherworld and he's made himself a number of enemies because of it, so in addition to coping with his misfortune, he's swept up in a grand adventure in the shadows of our world and in the subways and the sewers.<br />&quot;Neverwhere&quot; has a sense of humor that is similar to &quot;Good Omens&quot; and somewhat like Douglas Adams style of Sciece Fiction comedy.  But in &quot;Neverwhere&quot; the emphasis is on adventure.  And the unique setting makes for a very intersting adventure.  &quot;Neverwhere&quot; is easy to read and even though it isn't great literature, it is wel written, and it develops its plot and characters well.<br />Highly recommended.	2001-01-29

This review is for the entire &quot;Book of the New Sun&quot; of which &quot;Shadow &amp; Claw&quot; collects the first two books. Books three and four are collected in &quot;Sword and Citadel&quot;.<br />&quot;The Book of the New Sun&quot; is a very difficult book for me to review because it is so unlike anything else I've ever read. It meanders, depends on coincidence, changes direction abruptly, and is sometimes confusing.  In short everything I don't want in a book.  And, yet I was completely absorbed by this book and fell completely in love with it.<br />The story is told by Severian, a young member of the torturers guild, and chronicles his journey over many parts of Urth, the Earth of a future so distant that civilizations have risen and fallen countless times since the present, and the sun is growing old and cooler threatening to blanket the planet in a final ice age.  Much of the story deals with possible coming of the New Sun, a man who will give the earth a new sun to replace the dying one.<br />The setting is like that of many fantasy books, but with its aliens and reminants of advanced technology it is more properly science fiction.  But the general feel is a mythological one.  Many of the alien creatures, and forms of advanced technology, and even the narrative style remind me more of myths than of anything usually seen in either SF or fantasy.<br />Again, I really loved this book, but I can understand why some people might not like it at all. My recommendation is to give it a try, because it may become one of your favorite books.	2001-01-26

Geroge Martin's &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is rapidly becoming one of the greatest fantasy series of all time.  &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot; the second volume in the projected six volume series meets and perhaps excedes the expectations produced by the first book.  Unlike many other fantasy series that are simply long this one is long becuase the story it tells is so huge that to tell it in less words would simply be impossible. At times I felt the book was almost too short as sometimes key events are recounted after the fact and with little detail by charaters in the book.<br />The story of ASoiAF is not simply huge it is engrossing.  I found it difficult to put down.  Not only are the all the interconnected story threads interesting and well written but the back story, which includes such elements as the overthrow of the Mad King a generation earlier, the mysterious parentage of Jon Snow, and the death of Eddard Stark's sister, is equal fascinating and it is real joy to see this other story slowly unfold while to current events are described.<br />Martin has also created a very rich fantasy world.  The culture is fully developed, the politics is gritty and realistic, the action is violent and unsanitized.  Martin also includes traditonal magical elements such as dragons and wraiths, but rather than being common and trite, magic is a rare thing in Martin's universe which had dissapeared years ealier and is now slowly returning.<br />The characters are diverse and realistic, as well as numerous, but there are not so many the the reader cannot keep track of them all.  Each character behaves in a believable way and all the major characters contribute something to the story.  And though there are good guys and bad guys in this book, the line between the two is often blurred as the good characacters frequantly do bad things and the bad characters just as often do good things.  It's often hard to know who to root for though Martin does give his reader a few trulyabominable characters to root against.<br />It is hard for me to say enough good things about this book and this serious, but there ar a couple of minor critisms.  The principle one is that each section often ends with a cliff hanger.  This in itself is not a problem, but when we return to that character it is often days later and the crisis the character was in has already been resolved.  It's kind of like when a TV show goes to commercial break and when they get back the hero is out of danger.  It's not actually that bad since Martin always fills the reader in on what had happened but it is a somewhat ackward style and I wish Martin would drop it in later books.  <br />The other criticm that could be made, though I don't neccessarily make it myself, is that the book is very violent and Martin is not hesitant about killing off main characters just as he did in the first book.<br />Overall, this is a great book in a series that has the potential to sit next to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a true classic of fantasy.  I highly recommend it.	2000-11-19

Dickson tries to use the fact that his story is set in a high tech future to disguse the impausibility of his military plans.  But even if the reader accepts Donal's strategies as good it's hard to believe no one ever thought of them before.<br />The universe is unrealistic and Dickson treats human societies as if they themselves are individuals.  This might work if as individuals they weren't all completely one-dimensional. This is a very simplistic and unsasitisfying book which even fails to work as a simple time-passer do to the clumsy writing and silly characters.	2000-10-26

Instead, the story comes to a grinding halt, as Finney starts describing everything in excrutiating detail.  <br />At first the details are themselves interesting as Finney brings 1882 New York to life, but after chapter upon chapter of trivial details even the most avid student of 19th century history has to become bored.  And it just seems to get worse as the novel progresses:  Eventually, Si can't walk down the street without Finney spending several pages telling the reader ALL about it.<br />When Finney does find time to tell his story, the book doesn't fair any better since the story itself isn't any good.  The characters are two-dimensional and unbelievable.  This is an all around pointless book and huge let down.  I'm flabbergasted that some many people praise this book.	2000-10-18

Unique in its depth and detail describing the political turmoil in a fuedal kingdom.  Most of the familiar fantasy elements are here, but the focus is on the characters, and they could easily have been plucked straight for medival Europe.  Martin does not populate his fantasy world with and endless supply of elves and wizards and hobbits and the like, but gives us real human characters which the readers can understand and relate to.  The charcters each have their on complex desires and goals and this breings them each into to conflict with each other in ways too numerous to describe in anything less than the 800 pages of this book.<br />&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is a rare treat for the bold fantasy reader but the timid need not apply.  AGOT is dark, bloody, and intense, and at its enormous length (all the the more enormous when you consider Martin's entire tale will encompass six volumes) with every page full of complex plots and schemes, reading AGOT is quite a task.  But Martin's prose is easy to read and full of imagery, making AGOT a true joy to read.<br />The story is told from eight points of view.  Most of the POV characters are members of House Stark.  Lord Eddard Stark has been summoned to take the post of &quot;the King's Hand&quot; making him second only to the king. But Eddards conflict with King Robert's scheming wife soon place him and his family in danger as other forces plot to increase their own power and positions, it looks as if war is coming.<br />This all unfolds as winter (a season which last for years) is approaching, the last remaining heirs of the former king plot to return from their exile across the narrow sea, and mysterious forces from beyond the wall that defines the seven kingdom northern border begin moving south toward the lands of Lord Eddard.<br />&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is an amazing start.  If the other five books can do half as well, &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; will rival &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as the ultimate fantasy epic.d Fire&quot; will rival &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as the ultimate fantasy epic.	2000-10-09

I perhaps did not enjoy the individual adventures of the heros quite as much but this was made up for by the fact the the main story is advancing at a quicker pace.<br />This book is not for all taste.  The story is not padded but it is long.  Williams creates an entire unviverse and about a dozen complex, detailed characters.  Some readers my find the story progressing to slowly, (I would have liked for the last 150 pages of this volume to move a little more quickly, but why quibble.)  <br />Much is revealed and some questions finally get answered (but even more questions are created so there's plenty to look forward too.)

Ironically, in spite  of the fact that the idea of &quot;Speaker&quot; came independently of  &quot;Ender's,&quot; this book reads like a poor attempt cash in on the  success of &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and set up the story in  &quot;Xenocide&quot;, while offering very little the the reader  itself.<br />To be fair, Card is a very good writer and his talent shows  through often enough in individual scenes.  But the story as a whole and  many of the parts are unsatisfying.<br />The two biggest flaws are Cards  dependence upon the irrational actions of one of the books main characters,  Novinha, to set the story in motion and keep it heading in the right  direction, and the fact that much of the story centers around an unfolding  mystery that alert readers should have solved by the end of chapter  two.<br />The answer to the mystery is locked away in a file by Novinha  because she believes that this knowledge will lead to the deaths of whoever  knows it.  She even refuses to marry the man that she truly loves because  as her husband he would have access to files that she had sealed.  The book  offers no rational explination as to why Novinha feals the way she does,  and though she is a somewhat troubled character, their is no other  indication in the book that she is completely irrational or insane.  Making  her decision to seal these files inconsistant with her character.<br />But the  reader won't have to wait until the end when the files are opened to figure  out the incredible mystery thatlies within is because the mystery isn't so  hard to see and even if you can't figure it out immidiately (but you  probable will) Card drops loads of hints along the way--however their is a  small but interesting twist which isn't nearly as obvious as the bigger  mystery.<br />So people felt that Ender's Game had the same problem and that  the surprise at the end was no surprise.  I disagree, but I feel that if  you figured out the twist in &quot;Ender's&quot; in advance it stil  wouldn't ruin the story.  But &quot;Speaker&quot; depends to much on the  unfolding mystery aspect of the story and at times reads like an Agatha  Christie novel.  Which would be a good thing if Card hadn't spilled to  beans so early.  As it is this makes for a dull read.<br />However as usual,  Card's style is easy to read yet effective.  If you loved Ender's game and  want to read the sequel my advice is go ahead; it won't take very long and  their are some nice touches.  Aside from Novinha the character's are real  and easy to connect to.  I did not find the book to be either preachy or  full of moralizing as some have complained.  The book isn't a complete  wasn't of time for fans of the first book, but don't expect it to be in  anyway equal.  And if you've weren't blown away by &quot;Ender's Game&quot;  or have never read it then don't bother to read this one.	2000-09-09

Well written and thought  provoking. It deservedly won the Hugo award. Many SF readers are familiar  with Blish for his novelizations of the Star Trek TV episodes. But he is a  genuine talent in his own right and shouldn't be dismissed. If the book  seems to drag through the first fifty pages, stay with it. It is well worth  it. What is so fascinating about this book is that Blish's central  character is both a biologist and a catholic priest. By learning to see the  events in the story through to eyes of a priest and a scientist the reader  is brought to a conclusion both holy and horrifying. The climax is either a  triumph of God over Satan, or the greatest man-made tragedy the universe  has seen. And the ambiguity is not lost on Blish's priest/scientist and  hopefully not his reader.	2000-09-07

A man discovers hard scientific evidence that some part of the human mind continues to exist after death and then sets up an experiment creatinge three computer simulations of himself:  one has all  remembrance of physical existance edit out--simulating life after death,  another has all knowledge of death removed--simulating imortality, and the  third is unaltered--a control.  Then all escape and one commits a  murder--but which one!<br />But don't get excited; it's all a bore.  The  murder is committed in the absurb method of having a man's low-fat gravy  replaced with the real thing.  He's on medication that requires a very  strict diet so he dies.  But the reader doesn't have a chance to ponder how  ridiculous this is because he or she is still trying to figure out how the  author failed to realize how stupid the experiment is: the one with the  three copies of our hero.  All three know that they are simulations so the  control is hardly a real simulation of the main charcter, Hobson.  The one  with no knowledge of death, knows what death is and doesn't want to be  deleted.  These inconsistancies are lost on Sawyer who plows ahead with his  ridiculous murder plot.<br />Perhaps and even bigger problem is Sawyer's  failure to create realistic people.  All the minor characters--especially  the ones that are refered to in the &quot;news briefs&quot; scattered  throughout the book behave in unbelievable manners.  Like the Republican  Senator who becomes a supporter of Euthanasia becuase the existance of a  human soul has supposedly been proved!<br />The Major character don't fair  much better.  Each seems to be a mouthpiece for Sawyer to express his own  philosphical views.  Certainly the main two character's frequent asides on  subjects like abortion, child development, and evolution are  interchangable.  Simply reading them by themselves would give you know hint  of wether they are being uttered by Hobson or his friend.  The characters  are that one-dimensional.  <br />All things considered it is an easy read and  had a lot of potential.  But don't bother reading it.  And what in the  world is Phil Donahue doing in this book!	2000-06-22

It isn't even particularly well written. But it's  so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.<br />The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where  mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching  collapse of civilization.  This is an interesting enough premise and very  original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a  science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take  seriously.<br />If you come across a copy of this book, read it.

There has to be a very interesting story behind how this book came into existance. It seems at times to be intentionally bad. This is a great series and I highly recommend it through book VI. Book VII is also good if not quite as good but unfortunately in introduces new characters and ideas which are not resolved. This will tempt you to read book VIII, but be warned _Marriage of the Living Dark_ does not continue the plot threads begun in book VII.<br />Book VII ends foreshadowing big things for its new characters--Josef and Coffin Filler. But these characters are almost abandoned in _Marriage of the Living Dark_ and are not the slightest bit important to this story. Ben Shepard's obsession with death continues as he makes arrangments with Devore to get subjects for his experiments, but this plot line is soon forgotten. Instead, Part I of this book introduces yet another character Daniel and describes his battles in Eden, a &quot;training ground&quot; for Devore's boy army where they battle artificial insects. The purpose of this is never fully explained but has something to do with Devore's plans for molding mankind which was foreshadowed at the end of book VI. However, by part II this story thread is also abandoned and the only thing from part I to have any baring on the rest of the book is Daniel himself, a character who serves no purpose other than to be a great soldier who continually saves the other characters from danger.<br />Part II introduces much termoil in American where young Egan has to deal with a military defeat in the West, another enemy coming up from the South, the threat of Devore attacking from Europe, treachery from his own officials, and the return of his grandfather and his bid for power. Wingrove merely sets up this conflict and then forgets about it. Later the resolution to all of these problems is revealed in a one page account of these events by Li Yuan: An entire novel worth of story is condensed to a single page!<br />Thebook contiues to jump from idea to idea having conflicts resolved and main characters killed &quot;off-camera&quot; only to have these events tersely recounted to the reader after the fact. Finally, we reach the final chapter where Wingrove's multi-dimensional subplot introduced earlier becomes increasingly bizarre until we reach the last five sections of the last chapter which are the worst pages of incomprehisible and pointless dreck that I have ever read.<br />Then things go down hill--as if that where still possible--with an epilogue that COMPLETELY ignores the end of the book! The epilogue's inclusion in the book is so bizarre that it is the chief reason I suggest this book may be intentionally bad.<br />But worst of all, in addition to all of these problems (perhaps because of them), Marraige of the Living Dark fails to draw the reader in like the preceding books. It is a lifeless account of pointless events without emotional depth which fails to connect with the reader. <br />A real disappointment all around. I'm giving it two stars because I still loved these characters from what I'd read about them in the previous books, many individual sections are well written even if they don't fit together, and (believe or not) I have read worse books.	2000-06-13

Excellent science fiction novel on a grand scale, contains six stories told by six members of the last shrike pilgrimage. Any one of the stories makes the whole book worth reading, all six together make it a must read  for any SF fan or any one who just wants to be emersed into a startling  realistic future world filled with realistic and interesting characters.  The whole thing is bound together by the mysterious shrike whom the  pilgrims are each traveling to see, each with his own reason as revealed in  the individual tales. What raises this story up a notch to true greatness  is the depth of the universe in which these stories are set. A universe  with a great deal of history in it with real and complex political and  social issues. One word of warning: although the pilgrims complete their  tales in this book the overarcing story ends abruptly and is concluded in  &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot;. It is best to consider  &quot;Hyperion&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Hyperion&quot; as one and read  them together. The &quot;Fall of Hyperion&quot; is equal in quality to  &quot;Hyperion&quot; and brings the story to a fitting and in some ways  enigmatic conclusion.	2000-06-03

This is a good book, well written with an extemely interesting premise--advanced (and very alien) aliens come to earth after a nuclear war and &quot;save&quot; mankind but turning humans into something else.  The  aliens call this a trade, a trade of genetic material in which each the two  parties become something neither was before.  The humans aren't thrilled  with the idea and there lies the conflict.  This is all well and good and  certainly original and interesting but the humans in Butler's story seem  too self destructive, too violent, and too unreasonable.  At times Butler's  aliens seem more realistic and more diverse than her human charcters.   Still, it is both startling and thought provoking.  And certainly worth  reading.

Full of  well thought out and developed charcters whose actions and motivations are  realistic and compelling, and a well crafted story that does not always  unfold has expected, but never forgets that underneath it all it's a fairy  tale.

Otherland Vol. I is an excellent and highly imaginative blending of SF and Fantasy which can proved a great deal of enjoyment for readers who don't have the wrong expectations.  This is not actually a complete book but  merely the first fourth of a gigantic story being published in 4 parts.   Unlike some other massive sf adventures on this scale (David Wingrove's  Chung Kuo for instance),  Otherland does not cover the lives of dozens of  characters over the course of several years, but only a handful of  characters over a span of time measured in days.  Needless to say the story  is extremely detailed and progresses slowly toward its goal.  Reader's  expecting a speedy resolution to the story's plot will be disappointed.   Rather, enjoy each moment for what it itself contains.  Even as the main  story thread procedes slowly forward, interesting events occur on the  charcters lives.

If he'd written a colosal book in the style of David Wingrove's Chung Kuo with numerous story threads it might have worked better.  Instead he focuses almost solely on Batman and the story is reduced substantially.   Why does Rucka emphasize Batman's realization that he can't save Gotham  alone when the fellow heros that he calls upon for help seem to do almost  nothing.  Also Rucka actually adds a number of new ideas which are less  interesting than the ideas he had to eliminate from the comics to shorten  the book.  Rucka had a difficult task here:  condensing a comic crossover  that was made up of almost 100 comic books down to a single volume, so I  don't fault him for not living up to the challenge, but this book is for  die hard Batman fans only.  And if you've already read the comics I  wouldn't waste time on this book.	2000-03-11

Orson Scott Card is certainly a great writer, but he falls way short here.

These historians believe that it  is impossible for them to effect the past, but they learn that they are  wrong.  What follows is extremely contrived as Card suddenly decides that  his ideal future is actually on the verge of a collapse so complete that  society will never rise up again, and the people of the world VOTE to erase  their very existance in hopes of creating a better world!  Yikes!  In spite  of good writing and an excelent treatment of Columbus as a driven but  basically good man, Card never manages to overcome his ridiculus set up.

This book is better described as allegory.  And as  allegory it stinks.  It is a simplistic fantasy about how everyone could be  happy (and rich) if they joined a hippy cult, had sex all the time, and  used words like &quot;Grok.&quot;  This story wrapped up with a pointless  Christ metaphor (which might be meant to be taken litterly rather than as a  metaphor since at the end of the book it is impied that the cetral  character Michael is Michael the archangel which some fringe Christian  groups believe to be Jesus Christ.  After all it is a fantsy book.)  Oh and  there's catholic bashing, women bashing (&quot;whever a women is raped it's  partially her fault&quot; is uttered by one of his FEMALE characters), and  gay bashing.

Don't get bogged down in historical inacuracies or the fact that Arthur is Norman rather than Welsh like in most recent versions.  King Arthor isn't a real person he is a real  legend and he has been evolving for centuries.  Sometimes he's a Celtic  warlord other time a Roman general and other times a Norman king.  Often  Lancelot is by his side, but Lancelot is a French invention added to the  story centuries after it originated.  So just enjoy this story as fiction,  and Legend and don't worry about the &quot;real&quot; king Arthor.  The  Once and Future King is actually four books (a fifth, The Book of Merlin,  is also available but it isn't nearly as good.)  Of the four books Ill Made  Knight is the best as it deals with Lancelot and Guenivere's affair with  such poignancy and heart.  The Queen of Air and Darkness is often  unecessarily silly and is the worst of the four (I'd give it three stars by  itself.)  But the whole is an incredible epic.  Well worth your time.	2000-03-09

White's Once and Future King	If you like King Arthur and even if you don't you should read The Once and Future King.  Especially Ill Made Knight.  The most moving and compelling account of Lancelot's affair with Guenivere ever written.	2000-03-09

Though this is a great book for kids, it is also very entertaining for grown-ups as well.  Even a slow reader can read this book in a day and the story and charcters are all very interesting.  Not quit as good as its  darker follow-up, The Black Cauldron this is still a very good book.  And  don't be fooled by those who say Alexander rips off Tolkien.  The  simularities are the same ones that virtually every modern fantasy story  has with Tolkien.	2000-03-09

Absolutely dreadful book.  All the worse because the first hundred pages are so funny.  But after that it is pure dreck.  The book actually contains a terrible review of itself written into the text.  Surely it was meant as  a joke (or perhaps an excuse) but it's far closer to the truth.  Don't be  fooled by this books books cult status.  Avoid it.	2000-03-09

The first time a read Dune: Messiah I was more than a little disappointed.  By when I re-read Dune I also re-read Dune: Messiah.  This was the first time I'd read them back-to-back, and I realized that Dune: Messiah was  actually the conclusion to Dune and not a seperate book.  As a stand alone  book it's barely passable, as a sequal it's worth 3-stars, but as the  fourth part of the first book it's a perfect conclusion.  Dune was divided  into 3 parts (called books) and the last ends with a nice Hollywood ending.   Dune: Messiah shows the real conclusion to Paul's Life and the real  consequences of his actions in the rest of the book.  I think Herbert had  to end the first book with Paul on top of the Universe because that is what  reader's want, but Messsiah is a more somber look at what it means to have  power. After I had re-read Dune and Dune: Messiah, I came across used cliff  notes for Dune, and I noticed that it had an essay which treated to two  books as one and compared them to a Greek epic pointing out that Greek  epics didn't end when the hero was on top, but continued to the end of the  hero's life.  With the inclusion of Dune: Messiah, Dune now tells us the  complete story of Paul's life, and what an incredible story it is. Do not  read this book, rather read Dune and this book together.	2000-03-07
