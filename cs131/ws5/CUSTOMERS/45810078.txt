It's about battleships all right - little about cruisers or destroyers (the story of the Glowworm sinking is told here). I bought this book hoping it would help me as a modeler, but there are few good photos, and the illustrations are often cutaways showing the inside of a ship - not bad for a student though. It gives somewhat detailed history on warships, such as the Bismarck and Scharnhorst chases, but only the most well-known stuff are mentioned here. As a bonus though, the pic which supposedly shows the midget subs firing on the US battleships at Pearl Harbor is in here. All in all, it's quite an enjoyable read. Not a bad buy. But modelers should get something else.	2003-05-24

Though brief, the histories say a good deal. It doesn't list any of the smaller boats or subs, but they're probably considered not as important as the big capital ships.<br />But among the cons (which struck out one star), some other important ships are missing. I missed the Fuso and the Yamashiro, as well as Arizona and Gambier Bay. Also, the editing was not too good (The tonnage of the Takao was wrong - 41,000 for a cruiser!). The pictures were all black and white, and not all are very clear (there were some good shots, though). And it's thin, could have been filled with more. There are many references better than this, but buying this isn't really a loss. It's useful for those wanting a starter in surface warship history.	2002-05-15

The prosperity belief, &quot;name it and claim it&quot;, faith in faith, the healing gospel, all these are exposed of their heretical nature because they oppose many key teachings.<br />Hanegraaff tackles the Word of Faith beliefs espoused by Kenneth Hagin, Kenneth Copeland, Fred Price, Marilyn Hickey, Benny Hinn, and many others, all of which owe their source of ideas from EW Kenyon, though this may never be admitted. He gives extensive explanations of how Word-Faith theology and practices contradict orthodox Christian beliefs, citing bone-jarring quotes from these preachers and  <br />His organization of the book's content is very studious, using acronyms to organize information, like ABCDE, FLAWS, FAITH, and so on. Aside from studying the errors, he re-explains basic Christian beliefs.  It is not that easy to follow as promised, however, and though replete with information, it gets a bit difficult to absorb the volume of it. He also inserts anecdotes to illustrate a point, but sometimes draggingly. But what you get, you get it correctly, and his doctrinal explanations are correct.<br />Word-Faith adherents may be shaken in their boots because of this book, but they should put aside their reactions and study this book. And if you are not, this book will greatly help if you want to remain out of error.	2002-01-05

It is rational, logical and carefully thought-out, filled with aggressive research and its message is pertinent that a person must retain rational thought and never be given to emotions only in worship. Actually, the book is biased towards my kind of thinking.<br />While it is true that MacArthur's treatment of the matter is quite harsh to some, it may also be necessary. I myself am one disliker of the charismatic style of worship. Charismatism tends to suspend all sort of rational thought for full immersion into uncontrolled emotion, which is dangerous. Also, those who are fanatics of the form tend to ostracize those who do not like it, leading to a serious form of cultural (even cultic) cliquism. Thus MacArthur calls for reins to be pulled on this form of worship, as the negative effects are now being felt in many places, as with me.<br />Also, this book makes clear that one should &quot;Test Everything&quot; (1 Thes. 5:21). No matter how good an idea it sounds, it pays to have a healthy amount of skepticism against it, to make sure it stands and it is sound. If it stands correctly, then it can be trusted.	2001-10-31

Books	4	22	40	N	N	A very good turn of opinion	Thirty years after he wrote supposed proof of the non-authenticity of Catholic Christianity because it was riddled with paganism, Ralph Woodrow made an about-face and wrote that this kind of attack on Catholicism is pointless. In an obvious spate of realization and self-correcton, he writes that he based his biased views mostly on Hislop's The Two Babylons - another bigoted work - and sees that there is actually little connection between Catholic Tradition and pagan religion. If there were any, the connections are few and negligible, and maybe even helpful. <br />Woodrow actually attacks Hislop now and claims the Two Babylon's writer's methodology as faulty and careless. Just a few similarities of letters or syllables in language became the basis for Hislop to conclude that these similarities were actually proof of the same story of a dead god, a great whore queen, and so on. But this theory could not be proven, and so it fell. Catholicism is exonerated. Reason and trust are restored.	2001-09-22

He cites numerous works of the 19th century that I've never even heard of, including the classic Layard works on Nineveh and various early explorations of myth and legend, which allegedly give proof to the assimilation of ancient pagan traditions into the early church. This book soon rose to become one of the forbidden classics that you'd want to hide for fear of being burned to the stake for owning.<br />Hislop's research methodology though is flawed, and later you will realize that he has been speaking out his own biases against the Catholic Church. But it is no doubt a work that will amaze you. Hislop inadvertently pieces together an alternative history of the world where the hunter Nimrod becomes venerated by his people, but is later slain and the manner of his death is the wellspring of the many myths about murdered gods (Osiris, Balder, etc.). It may soon become a great source for ideas on science fiction and fantasy stories, but the information in it will certainly leave doubts in your mind about the authenticity of tradition-oriented Christianity.	2001-09-22

Today, however, people are inventing new creatures aside from giant eagles, elves, demons and druids, so the Elfstones of Shannara is old material for me.

Astyanax, who should have been thrown down from the walls of Troy as a babe, is still around and he grows to start a new Trojan war, which he does by stealing Helen again. But on the way, he sees the terrible effects of a recent war: deprived states, chaotic governments, rampant crime and death, tragic fates, all of which happened to the Greeks as well as the Trojan after their great war. He probably thought when he returned, maybe I should jump from the walls of Troy anyhow. But it's a great adventure. The events are amazing, the telling gripping, the magical element awe-inspiring (especially Memnon, the Ethiopian god-king). I can't believe such a gem as this was missed by the fantasy-reading public.	2001-08-28

It is a good intro to the Eternal Champion series because it is the simplest. John Daker, moaning that he has many lives, many forms, introduces the true nature of the champion. Yet for me, the Eternal Champion is one of the best switching-sides story. The hero is told by humans that they're the good guys and the Eldren are the bad guys, and so he fights for them. Then he realizes that the truth is the other way around, so he switches to the Eldren and beats the crap out of humans. It makes me wonder, is what we've been taught as right since childhood really right, or are we being deceived? There's some implied philosophy for you. The next two parts are about the other guises of the Eternal Champion. After this, Moorcock has placed the Eternal Champion in every possible speculative fiction setting: post-apocalyptic earth, steampunk, time travel, sword and sorcery, etc. It's a series any questioning hero would love.	2001-08-28

I have read a few novels and a short story of his recently, but I read this book before all those. Stableford's advice is extensive and used a lot of examples to illustrate points about speculative fiction writing. However, his book falls short in presentation because it uses a lot of continuous text, which can be tiring and monotonous for those whose attention control needs an extra kick. There is a lot to learn from this book, but its presentation could be greatly improved by using a graphic manner. There certainly are some perspectives and points about science fiction and fantasy writing that can be garnered from Stableford, though, so I don't think I wasted my P279.

What I found overwhelmed me. Strict application of `science' to the fiction is common; most stories have discussions of scientific principles in them, even in the most simple of tales. Rare are the stories you see the science only applied and not discussed. Even Gene Wolfe's simplistic protagonist in `Has Anybody Seen Junie Moon?' describes a scientific discussion on gravity. So with the primitive Night-Dawn in Stephen Baxter's `Huddle', who puts forth a theorem in a scientific manner, though it was done simply; I take the message to be that whatever humanity mutates into, it will retain scientific reasoning. I hope this does not aggravate the impression of science fiction being `hifalooting'. A couple of stories are mostly talk (Stableford's and Swanwick's); action and movement does not seem to be a looked-for element in a sci-fi story. Of course, I do not disagree that science can be left out of SF, but the acronym can mean just `speculative fiction', and the science need not necessarily be flatly explained. But I do assume that `hard' sci-fi, with scientific explanations, is what most editors are looking for.      For me, it seems that applauded sci-fi stories can be hard to understand; I barely got what the authors were trying to put across in `Sexual Dimorphism' and `Everywhere' (The former is especially heavy in scientific jargon). Michael Bishop's poem is a mystery to me. Guess I'm not that sharp a reader of SF as I thought. Traditional themes can be found, like space opera, alternative history, time travel and cyberpunk, but are not easily identifiable unless you've really read between the lines.      But there is a trend. Most of the stories here project humanity in various future situations, having moved to new states of life, gone to new places or using new technology, but they stillhave to deal with problems spawned by these new states. We have human-animals specifically bred for a brutal sport, people living for thousands of years and trying to bear with it, an Attention Deficit Disorder sufferer being treated with a cyborg implant, people living on a threatened moon, among others. New ideas have ceased to appear, so the themes are now more on problems caused by these ideas, and how to solve them.       With regard to the editor's comments, I would say that Hartwell gives pertinent info on background. Revealing where the story was first published helps to identify those markets. Analog looks for problem-solving stories, Artemis is about the moon, so forth. His picks were also as varied as possible; different themes, different styles, different origins (Nice to know that there was one Japanese work there, one of those I liked more in this collection). But I wish he'd tell simply why those stories he chose were the best for him. Anyhow, I have an idea on what the editors of the various Sci-fi magazines are looking for. Thanks, David.	2001-01-11
