US	52774553	R1HPF9PEZ0UP1E	1570033633	154048196	The Jewish Confederates (NS)	Books	5	7	9	N	N	An Interesting account of Jewish life in the South before and during the Civil War.	I've had Jewish friends in Memphis and New Orleans whom I was surprised to learn had Ancestors in the Army of Northern Virgina and the Army of Tennessee.  Rosen's book shows that the Civil War truly was a War of Brother against Brother no matter the ties by social status, national origin, or religion. <br /> <br />Rosen has done quite a bit of research and presents his narrative with the recollections, diaries,  and letters of the participants and their families and friends.  This kind of history by correspondance has always appealed to me more than the memoir type that is carefully thought out later to put the event or individual in the best light. <br /> <br />Rosen presents us with Jews living a normal life in the antebellum South similar to that enjoyed by their White Christian neighbors.  The same predjudices and toleration for the \\"peculiar institution\\" exist for them as it does for their neighbors but I sense there is more of a toleration amongst this community for the Abolitionists Movement among Antebellum Jews than other groups in the South. <br /> <br />When War comes young men enlist and fight for the same cause as their Christian neighbors and with the same Gallantry.  First hand accounts of the struggles and hardships of the War come from the letters soldiers write home to their families. <br /> <br />Rosen presents Jewish Life from the viewpoints of many players from well known Lousiana politician Judah P. Benjamin who held many positions in Jefferson Davis' Cabinet to less well known immigrants from Spain and Germany who started stores in rural Mississippi and Arkansas. <br /> <br />One story that I could not find was that of Sergeant Mordecai Solomon or Solomon Mordecai of Jackson, Mississippi who won the Confederate Medal of Honor at Spotsylvania Court House in 1864 and whose Synagogue was bombed by the KKK 100 years later <br /> <br />The book is a must for Civil War enthusiasts and may be helpful in Geneology research.	2005-09-22

Gragg's book is very easy to read and is filled with great descriptions of the many participants.  He describes why Wilmington was so vital to the survival of the Confederacy and why its capture was so important to the Union for a quicker end to the War.      Some of the most interesting characters of the Civil War participated in at least one of the battles.  William lamb was 29 years old when he finished building the fort. Young Lamb had a keen interest in military history. As a young boy of twenty in the mid-1850s, Lamb became captivated by a farawy war that was then being waged between Russia, Great Britain, and France.  Fisher's design and physical features drew praise from her Federal captors-and more than a few references were made to the Russian fortress of Malakoff (a defensive bastion at Sebastopol that had greatly influenced Lamb's efforts to strengthen Fort Fisher)that was built during that war.     The First Battle effectively ended the military career of Union General Bejamin Butler, a \\"Political General\\" who was a constant headache for both the Lincoln Administration and any Commander to whom he was a subordinate.  The Failure to capture the Fort after a sucessful amphiboious landing was the final nail in his coffin and he did not receive another command during the war.    Is there a Confederate defeat outside of Gettysburg and Petersburg that does not have the hand of General Braxton Bragg somewhere behind it?  Bragg was in command in Wilmington instead of being cashiered after Missionary Ridge mainly because he was friends with Jeff Davis.  Bragg did not send reinforcements to the fort that would have cut off Banks' invaders.    Alfred Terry was in command of the second attempt to storm the fort in January 1865.  One of the lesser known of Grant's favorite lieutenants, he is better known as the scapegoat of Custer's Last Stand.    Lt. William B. Cushing USN was a precursor of the Navy SEALS.  He had many special forces operations during the war including the sinking of the CSS Albemarle with a mine and doing soundings in a rowboat off Fort Fisher while under fire.    Gragg's book was a page turner for me even though I knew the outcome beforehand and I would reccomend it to Civil War enthusiasts everywhere.    UPDATE:  02/14/2006.  NC Educational Television ran a television adaptation of the Book last week featuring a recreation of the two invasions of Ft. Fisher.  It really helped bring the book to life.	2005-09-14

The two cyber critics repeat many of the scandals they have reported on the in the past regarding the celebrity IMportants they regularly feature in their columns and on Drudge but their biting sarcasm always hits my funnybone.  Their interview with South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone is hilarious. <br /> <br />Someone should take their idea for \\"Courtney Love:the Musical\\" and put it on Broadway.   <br /> <br />Some will be offended by the profanity in the book but most of it is quoting a Celebrity or someone having the misfortune to be graced by their presence. <br /> <br />Overall the main theme of the book is Hollywood is bad because the main thought out there is \\"we're Celebrities.  We're rich and famous not because we have better agents and publicists than 3000 other people with more talent singing at Holiday Inns and performing at Little Theatres across America but because we're really smarter than all you unwashed masses in flyover country\\".	2005-09-13

I would say its Stephen King without the sex and cursing.  Its not really a theological book as some of his earlier writings are.  Its a monster story; real monsters against a man made monster.  <br /> <br />It was a story which was easy to follow and the suspense built well.  Its not so scary as to give you nightmares.  Each chapter begins with a map that has icons which shows where the earlier action took place.  I found this to be a novel idea and it helped keep things in perspective for me. <br /> <br />Its not really a religious story but more of a woman is captured by monsters/aliens/indians and must be rescued story.  One of the protagonists is a college professor who was fired for believing in Creationism or intelligent design and the Cheif antagonist is a geneticist who has fooled around with DNA to prove evolution and like Dr. Frankenstein has created a monster on the loose.  With all the Intelligent Design/Evolution stories in the news thats about as close as it comes to talking about religion though most of the main characters seem to be church goers. <br /> <br />Overall it was light escapism and I wouldn't be surprised to find it made into a film reminiscent of those campy monster movies from the 40's and 50's that used to show up on the Late Late Show  though its a lot like \\"The Legend of Boggy Creek\\" which shows up sometimes on Mystery Science Theatre 3000.	2005-08-24

I've always enjoyed Medved on his TV movie review shows and I enjoyed his previous political book \\"Hollywood vs America\\".  I found the story of his life to be very interesting from the story of his grandparents leaving the Ukraine during the famine of the WWI years to his life today.    I must say he has taken some rather interesting twists and turns along the way from a Liberal Free Love Sweet and Sour Pork eating secular Jewish kid to the Conservative Family Values Kosher keeping  Sabbath Keeping Traditional Jew he is today.  I never knew that it was he and his brother who started the \\"Golden Turkey\\" awards for the Worst Movies of all times nor that the awful NBC Series \\"Whatever Happened to the Class of 65?\\" was based on a book he wrote with Irving Wallace's Son.    People who disagree with Michael often blast him as a mean spirited kind of guy but the person he presents here is not that.  If has an opinion and if you disagree with it thats ok.  He was aquainted with many leaders of the Progressive Movement today while at Yale and seems to still have a good relationship with them.    His Odyssey from McGovern campaign worker to Bush voter and Conservative Commentator is well reasoned and follows a logical progression as does his Spiritual Journey in the Jewish Faith.  I think Medved is someone who would be very interesting to sit down and have a conversation with about entertainment, religion, and politics.	2005-08-24

McPherson's Book is in my opinion the best Modern History of the Civil War Years.  Extensively researched and footnoted it begins with the Mexican War and the opening of the Southwest to Slavery and ends with a critique of why the war ended when it did and various scenarios for the prolonging of the War by the South that seems to anticipate the book, \\"April 1865, the Month That Saved America\\". <br /> <br />The events leading up to the war are throughly examined from the Mexican War to the inaguration of Abraham Lincoln.  This takes up about the first third of the book.  The country is deeply divided over slavery, Federal Monies for public works, immigration policy and the Tarriff.  The Whig Party implodes over the issue of Slavery and the New Republican Party is born from its ruins. <br /> <br />The rest of the book covers the war years and spend much more time on the political and economic ramifications of the War on North and South than on an examination of strategy and tactics.  Overall it is an easy to read history for those who want to understand what was happening in the U.S. during this period. <br /> <br />For a history of the events and battles of 1861-65 I would also reccommend the Century Magazine's four volume set of reccollections of the participants first published in 1888, \\"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War\\".  Most other accounts of the Civil War rely heavily on that book.	2005-08-04

I enjoyed them then and bought them for my son to read on vacation last summer.  I just got the prequel at the library and read it recently.<br /><br />Though it may seem to be a retelling of the War of the World's Christopher's aliens are more complex than Welles Martians and it takes a great effort by humanity to attempt to throw off their yoke or caps as the case may be.  No dues et machina here!<br /><br />In the future humanity has been conquered by aliens who have taken over peoples minds by the use of television.  Once conquered they require that humans be fitted with a mind control device once they reach puberty.  A boy sees how much an older friend has changed once he becomes 'capped' and decides to escape to the mythical white mountains where uncapped humans are free of the aliens and fight an underground war.<br /><br />The books follow the hero to the White Mountains, then to a mission as a spy disquised as a capped servant in the alien city, then finally to Humanity's last ditch attempt to defeat the invaders.<br /><br />A great story for the Jr. High set	2005-07-26

Florida's assertion is that the so called creative class gravitates to places that are open to new ideas and are diverse in population.  In each of the domestic cities that he sited in his last book, Austin, TX etc, they all had something in common that he did not mention; right to work laws(i.e. no Union Contracts necessary), low real estate prices, and low taxes. <br /> <br />Here we are a few years later and we discover that the oligarchs that comprise the creative classes are packing their bags and moving overseas.  Florida seems to think its because they aren't enough Mappelthorpe exhibits or other such openness in Repressive America these days.   <br /> <br />His first example is Wellington New Zealand where Kiwi director Peter Jackson is producing big budget movies that used to bear the stamp of Hollywood USA.  Florida seems to think there is some magical thing about Wellington that is attracting the studios Way Down Under.  The fact is you can make movies far more cheaply in New Zealand, Oz, Romania, Estonia, or even Vancouver than you can in the USA due to the lower costs of labor.  You can pay a grip or a best boy about a sixth the salary that he would get as required by Local 302 in Burbank or Wilmington.  A Kiwi or Bollywood geek is willing to do your CGI animation for about a quarter of what it would cost having a Hollywood techie do it for you. <br /> <br /> <br />The film industry (among others) was booming here in NC in the 80's and 90's due to the cheap costs of Labor and taxes.  The State Government since then has decided to become New York or California as far as taxes and labor goes and many of the big local companies are looking at off shoring as a legitimate alternative now that the New South is starting to resemble the old rust belt.  They are moving overseas to control costs against the bottom line not for some longing for artistic freedom of expression. <br /> <br />I think the author needs to spend less time in the Salon with the aristocracy of pull and more time out here in the real world with the unwashed masses.	2005-07-13

While \\"Starshield\\" was exciting and interesting, Nightsword seems like an attempt to pacify fans of the Weis and Hickman Dragonlance series by setting the action in a fantasy zone with Dragons and a Pirate Crew made of mythical creatures.  The main characters of the first novel are now on the run from the Omnet a combination CNN/CIA to which the Heroine Merinda Neskat belonged and which now consider her a renegade.  The human Jeremy Griffiths has found the first of the three articles of power of the lost Kendais empire, the Mantle of Kendais Dai and has used it to find the second article the Nightsword, a weapon that can change physical reality.   <br /> <br />Hot on their heels is the evil Tarq of Gandry the head of Omnet who covets the artifacts of the lost empire for himself.  The characters go thru many adventures and at the end it is hinted that the Starshield itself will be found on a primitive backwater planet called \\"Earth\\". <br /> <br />Alas, due to contractural reasons, Starshield:Starshield will probably nevr be written and our heroes and heroine will hang out in time stop forever. <br /> <br />This is terrible because Starshield showed so much promise and there was even a online interactive group started by Tracy Hickman [...] where you could create your own stories in the midst of the Starshield Universe(the lost carrier mentioned in one of the Omnet newscasts in Darksword was my own CSS Ark Kansas).

America	Up until about 100 years ago every summer in the South was met with dread as the Yellow Jack would invade cities and the epidemics would last until the first frost. <br /> <br />This book provides a history of those dark days and the triumphs and tragedies of the group of Scientists and Doctors such as Walter Reed who studied and fought the disease that killed more americans than Spanish bullets during the Spanish American War.  <br /> <br />Yellow Fever spread to the New World from Africa carried over by mosquito larvae in the water casks of European Slave ships ferrying Africans to the Dread Sugar plantations of the Carribean.  Trading ships from the Carribean would frequently land in american ports carrying the mosquitoes and people infected with yellow fever frequently causing epidemics along the atlantic coasts plagueing such modern urban areas as Philadelphia and Baltimore. <br /> <br />This history of yellow fever shows why there is so much concern today with imported diseases such as West Nile and Avian Flu. <br /> <br />The book is also a good history in the advance of science and medicine since the 18th century as peominent American physicians of the 1780's still bled their patients to balance their humours and blamed the epidemic on stinky garbage vapours while in the 1890's the doctors were seeking out an insectivoid vector for the disease.	2005-06-20

Though we can guess on which side of many environmental issues that he leans, he does well in positioning both sides of many questions. <br /> <br />The example of Easter Island is exceptionally chilling.  The inhabitants basically denuded their island of trees to build the impressive stone statues they left to show their power.  The author asks what could the person who chopped down the last tree been thinking?  With no trees there were no more canoes to catch fish and dolphins, no more rope, and with soil erosion depleted gardens.

This biography presents a parallel biography of the two most interesting women in British History Mary Queen of Scots and Elizabeth Tudor.  Both women are followed from early childhood until middle age when politics finally brought their relationship to a fatal close. <br /> <br />Mary was Queen of Scotland almost from birth and her French mother arranged for her to be betrothed to the young Dauphin of France so that she would be Queen of both France and Scotland. <br /> <br />Elizabeth was the youngest daughter of Henry VII.  Her chances of becoming queen were slim to begin with and were complicated by her being erroneously implicated in plots against first her brother Edward VI and then her sister Mary I.  Fortunately thru her wits she was able to survive both trips to the tower of London and became Monarch after the untimely deaths of her siblings. <br /> <br />Mary had a claim to the English throne thru Henry's sister and her Catholic family in France tried to enforce her rights to Elizabeth's throne by casting doubts on the legitimacy of Henry's marriage to Anne Boleyn.  This is what ultimately brought the two women into conflict, the practical Elizabeth frustrating the emotional plans of her cousin to succeed to the throne and eventually imprisoning her and taking her life. <br /> <br />Eventually Mary was seen as a martyr and her son became King of both England and Scotland begining the unfortunate rule of the Stuart Dynasty. <br /> <br />I would reccommend the book to anyone interested in this period of history or in Women's Studies.  In addition to Elizabeth and Mary we are introduced to other strong willed women of the time:  Anne Boleyn, Mary of Guise, and Catherine de Medici.	2005-06-15

I believe that the story is an allegory for the direction that the author saw the country turning.    He envisioned an America where everyone has universal healthcare and no one suffers from the ravages of Tay Sachs, hemophilia, or sickle cell anemia but where those who have these conditions and other congenital deformities are aborted or live Brain Dead in Body Banks ready to 'donate' a body part to those in need.    No one worries about having to live on social security into old age as once you turn 75, the government has you report to a euthanasia center(shades of Edgar G. Robinson in \\"Soylent Green\\").      The future he paints is not bright and the ending of the story is not pleasant, but with recent cases in the news and the ascendancy of the culture of abortion and euthanasia the late author may have painted a picture of where we are headed as a society	2005-06-15

I remember stories about the Great Flu from older relatives who were children in 1918.  It was like someone describing living thru the days of the black plague.    I found this book to be a good history of that time and a good biography of the doctors who tried to stem the pandemic that was killing more Americans than German bullets in 1918.  The epidemic killed 5% of the world's population between the ages of 15-35.  A great tragedy when compiled on top of those lost in battle from 1914-18.  Isolated peoples on the pacific islands and in the arctic who had never been exposed to various strains of the flu were practically wiped out.    I found the book provided an intimate glimpse into the lives of the people fighting the pandemic in the US and into those infected.  It was also insightful to see the blindness of government bureaucrats who made decisions to promote the war effort at the expense of protecting the public from infuenza.    The scariest thing is we're on a mutation or so away from another pandemic the size of 1918.

I bought the Hardback.  that wasn't enough.  I bout the first three issues of the Dark Horse comic.  That wasn't enough.  Bought the Graphic novel to get the final issue of the comic.  That wasn't enough.  Went online and bought tickets to the midnight showing.  Now I'm waiting anxiously for next wednesday!!! <br /> <br />I'll probably go out and buy the Episode III storybook today! <br /> <br />Seriously, the comics and the graphics novel are another in a series of excellent trips into the Star Wars Universe as envisioned by the Writers and Artists of Dark Horse Comics that began for me with Dark Empire and Crimson Empire years ago.	2005-05-09

Lots of characters and subplots but only one or two that really matter.  Probably the entire trilogy could have been done in one book that concentrated on Vor, Serena, the Valiant Harkonnens, Erasmus, and Agamemnon.  The Guild, Bene Gesserit, and Fremen subplots didn't really work. <br /> <br />The end of \\"Battle of Corrin\\"  seems to be setting us up for yet another prequel trilogy documenting the birth of the Guild, the Landsraad, the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the Mentats.  I hope not, but I will probably read them anyway. <br /> <br />Its a shame that Herbert died before we could get his entire vision though these books aren't as hard to follow as those by Chris Tolkien.	2005-05-05

Another author once said of Crichton that most of his books are long essays told in a story format.  Medieval Morality plays with better writing.  Sometimes the essay works like in Jurassic Park.  Sometimes it works but the story falls flat like in \\"Timeline\\".  Sometimes everything just falls flat like in \\"Airframe\\".     \\"State of Fear\\" is adequate.  I would say that though the story is quite preachy, the main characters are always explaining Crichton's position on \\"Junk Science\\"(I don't see this like some others as a right wing big business sponsored conspiracy against global warming like some but a polemic by one scientist against his fellows who are happy to accept any popular theory that comes along to ensure funding) to other characters who are unenlightened.    The main villains are members of an mythical environmental group that is actually a fund raising front for a group of lawyers.  The group hires radicals to fake extreme environmental catastrophes scheduled to coincide with a Climate Change Conference they are sponsoring.    A George Soros type billionaire who has donated millions to the group to pursue a lawsuit against the EPA becomes suspicious that the lawsuit will never happen and that his money is going to be used for other purposes.  He comes in contact with a secret government anti terrorism unit and begins to clash with the lawyers and the enviro terrorists.    The protagonist of the story rather resembles The Green Hornet.  He even has an Asian Sidekick ala Kato but his comes from Nepal instead of the Philippines (a gurka perhaps?).  Anyway we go from one impossible situation to another and the dues et machina descends from the sky to save everyone each time.  Of course I read it in one sitting.    Once reading the novel I have become more concerned about how the public views the environment.  Why isn't the government doing more to remove Dihydrogen Monoxide from homes?  If as little as one tablespoon is breathed into your lungs you immediatelybegin having problems breathing and can even die.  There was just a story in the news on Friday about a young man who died when exposed to Dihydrogen Monoxide while swimming in Lake Wylie.  ITS A CRISIS!	2005-04-26

I was very pleased how everything is wrapped up and things are set up for the original Star Wars to begin. <br /> <br />There are many \\"Ah-Ha\\"! moments and many scenes of bravery and depravery.  The story is much darker than any of the previous episodes but we were expecting that weren't we ;-)?  The ending though is more satisfying than the best segment of the series, The Empire Stikes Back.  I can't wait until the movie comes out on DVD and we can spend a New Year's eve some day watching Episodes 1-6 back to back. <br /> <br />One caution though the Book is definitely PG-13.  I would recommend the Scolastic or the Storybook versions for preteens.  There are so many flying limbs and decapitations in the Book I am a bit apprehensive about taking my 7 year old and my 10 year old to see the movie. <br /> <br /> <br />**************Spoiler*********** <br /> <br />They forgot to finish off Jar Jar Binks.	2005-04-06

Stirling's Tale reminds me of Mad Max without Cars. The loss of electricity, steam power, and gunpowder returns the world to the year 1000. I found the situation very engrossing and the characters were very heroic and likable.  <br /> <br />Juniper Mckensie is an Oregon Witch. Most of her followers are either members of her Coven or SCA get-a-lifes who find that their recreational training in Medieval Combat Techniques come in handy in a World without firearms. Her followers develope into a Scottish/Pictish clan complete with Bagpipes.  Mike Havel despite his Czech name is a descendent of Finnish Sissi warriors. The ex Marine and his band are lucky enough to have a horse wrangler join early on and they develope into a Mongol cavalry for hire for other surviving bands as they make their way to Mike's former employer's ranch. <br /> <br />The two groups eventually join together to twart an invasion by followers of the 'Protector', a former medieval history professor who has taken over one of the larger cities in Oregon and fancies himself the second coming of Sauron even using the 'Eye of Sauron' from LOTR as his ensign.  <br /> <br />My only issue with the story is that the climax seems to be a setup for a sequel as the two group's join together and the 'Protector' is still at large.	2005-04-05

Since reading Alexander Dumas novels as a child I have always been fascinated with the intrigue and byzantine plots of the French Court.  I was first made aware of the accusations against the Marquise de Montespan in a history book by Jacques Barzun which made her out to be a female anti christ or the whore of babylon.  Somerset's history of the events goes into more depth and paints Athenais to be more of an earlier version of the witless Marie Antoinette than a French Lady McBeth.<br /><br />The whole affair of the poisons caused a paranoia that turned a criminal investigation into a Salem Witch Hunt or better yet a grassy knoll conspiracy that reached into the highest level of government.  The fact that torture or the threat of torture and painful death were used to gain most of the 'confessions' was not seen as detrimental to the case by the public makes me glad in live in more modern times.<br /><br />The court of Louis XIV was the height of decadance and its opulance eventually caused the bankruptcy of the French treasury during the reign of his descendants leading to Revolution, Terror, and the Rise of the First Empire.	2005-03-31

I have been a big fan of Jon Krakauer and his ability to present terrible stories with a sense of humanity.  His own experience in barely surviving bad weather on Mt Everest that killed many others in his party in \\"Into Thin Air\\" and the story of Chris McCandless's fatal trip into the Alaskan Wilderness to live alone amongst nature like Thoreau are both tragic glimpses into the lives of people living on the edge. Both books show what people are thinking at the time they are faced with their own mortality.  I would highly reccommend them in addition to this book. <br /> <br />I originally thought from the view of the mountains on the cover that this book would be about some Muslim Theocracy in the foothills of the Himalayas around Afganistan.  I was surprised to find it involved people seeking a Theocracy in the foothills of the Rockies instead.  This is the story of the most powerful and dangerous of extreamists, those who hear the voice of god in their head and who finds that its their own voice speaking to them. <br /> <br />Krakauer sets thing up with a history of the LDS Church.  While he presents some of the crimes of previous extreamists who committed crimes that may have been at the command of Brigham Young and others, he does not shy away from the violence committed against the Mormons in New York, Illinois, and Missouri before they made it to Utah. <br /> <br />He presents the killers as normal human beings.  The Lafferty's are shown as hard working young men who came under the sway of a religious doctrine that satisfied their own inner desires.  When their brother broke away and the wives of one of the others decided that a life as one wife in a polygamic relationship was not for her, one of the brothers \\"heard\\" a message from God telling them to kill the sister in law whom they blamed for their separtion from wife and brother. <br /> <br />In interviews with the brother in prison who 'heard' God tell him to murder his sister in law and niece, Krakauer found someone without remorse.  Someone who truly believes he has done the will of God. <br /> <br />The book is a welcome antidote for those who believe that dangerous religious extreamism is only found in the middle east.  I only hope that it is not used to paint all fundamentalists as being exactly like the Laffertys.	2005-03-31

This book stinks so badly that it must be Limberger Cheese we've lost.

The first two were fairly intriguing but the rest I was only able to browse thru after relatives finished.  I tried to give this one a chance but I would say \\"The Omen\\" was a better plotted book on the same theme and is probably as near to the truth on what will actually happen at the end of days as the LB series.	2005-03-31

Stephenson had better be glad he hooked me with the story of Quicksilver Half Cocked Jack Shaftoe, king of the vagabonds, and Eliza the Harem girl in volume one or I never would have cracked the others.   <br /> <br />Jack and Eliza's adventures apart in volume II were worth the effort of reading 800+ pages. <br /> <br />Volume III dragged a bit due to the main character being driven by the plot is Dr. Waterhouse and the side story of the machinations of Jacobites and Hanoverians contesting the Crown of England at the Death of Queen Anne.  In the end all turns out as it should and I was pleased with the outcome of the lives of all of the major players with whom I'd invested my time. <br /> <br />I would suggest before anyone attempt to climb the heights of the Baroque Cycle that they first read the first part of Jacques Barzun's \\"From Dawn to Decadence: 500 Years of Western Cultural Life, 1500 to the Present\\" or take the class at that OTHER online Bookseller and Anne Somerset's \\"The Affair of the Poisons: Murder, Infanticide, and Satanism at the Court of Louis XIV\\".  Both provide good background to the Europe that Jack, Eliza, and Dr. Waterhouse live in.	2005-03-29
