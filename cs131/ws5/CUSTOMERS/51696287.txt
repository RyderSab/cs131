The price is significant, and the course is rather old. It looks old - the English font looks like typescript. Why, then, do I recommend the prospective Urdu learner buy this book?    The answer is that it is perhaps the best language course I've seen. It works consistently and thoroughly. this is how it goes:    There are three volumes. Vol. 1 and 2 together make the full course, but one can make a lot of headway into the language with volume 1 alone. Each volume may be bought with six cassettes. Volume 3 contains the vocabulary and (I think - my copy's in storage) the index.    The method is simple and scientific. Text is initially introduced in transcription. The script is introduced in several chapters (the first is chapter 8) in a completely thorough manner, more throughly than I've seen it elsewhere. (This material is also sold separately as 'The Urdu Writing System'.) When you come to the script, you've already heard and assimilated a lot of Urdu, and the script comes more easily (though I have to admit to having learned Arabic long before reading these chapters). All the Urdu text is superbly written by an excellent calligrapher in the nasta'liq script (ta'liq or Farsi to Arabic-speakers).    The method. First one listens and reads through a conversation in Urdu, each sentence of which has new words introduced first. On the tape, each new word is repeated twice, and finally the sentence is is repeated, twice. And on to the next sentence.    Next, the words you've just been exposed to are discussed: how they're used, whether they're used in the same way in all dialects, etc. A bit of cultural information comes through here too.    Next, phonetic drills. Urdu, while simple gramatically, has some sound combinations that are VERY hard for the English speaker to hear, let alone imitate. These listening drills are very helpful.    Next, the grammar introduced in the conversation is discussed.     Next, additional vocabulary is added. (For example, a chapter introducing numbers 11-20 and days of the week includes those that haven't already appeared in the conversations.)    Next, drills. You are given a model sentence, and alter it.   e.g.:    ---- I am ---------- going to --- the house ----- tomorrow.  ---- you are ----------- \\" ---- the university ------ \\"  ---- she is ------------ \\" ------- Peshawar --------- \\"  ---- Mr. Rahim is ------ \\" ------ the office -------- \\"    This sounds boring. But it makes one learn structures, rather than words. That's its intention, and it works. And there are a lot of drills! Drills are more boring in class than on ones own, I find.    Next, some things for translation.    Finally, another, unbroken, conversation. This is different to but uses the same sort of structures and themes as the main conversation. On the tape, this 'conversation practice' follows an unbroken version of the main conversation.    The price is high, but fair, I think. The publisher - I bought the book direct from them - told me it was their best-selling course, and they've a lot of courses. The reason it sells well is its excellence.     The only negative I will bring in is that it is getting on in years - it's over 40 years old, and some of the material could do with an update. But I don't think there's a better course out there.	2005-08-23

The three volumes by Gibb (reprinted here by Munshiram Manoharlal of New Delhi) were supplemented in 1994 by C.F. Beckingham's translation of the final volume, and a fifth index volume was added by A.D.H. Bivar in 2000. Both additional volumes are available through the Haklyut Society (they are in the same size bindings, though in the Haklyut Society's colours).  Volume 4 is [[ASIN:0904180379 The Travels of Ibn Battuta: A. D. 1325-1354, Vol. 4 (Hakluyt Society, Second Series, 178)]] and Volume 5 is [[ASIN:0904180670 The Travels of Ibn Battuta: Index (Hakluyt Society, Second Series, 190)]]. Neither volume is cheap. You could save a lot of money by joining the society, however.    Gibb handed the translation on to Beckinham in 1971, who used Gibbs' own notes - where they existed - as well as his own work to complete the translation.

Wright's knowledge of Arabic and his use of Arab grammarians was vast, and he's worth persevering with. The traditional Western terminology is a positive advantage to anyone who's used to it, and I must say I think Jacob Minsky's examples are among the most extreme in the book, tho' his point is well made. However, Wright introduces the Arabic terminology almost everywhere, which is a great boon - modern writers tend to ignore Arabic terminology, which is rather pig-headed as it leaves the student unable to discuss language with Arabic speakers, and at a disadvantage when trying to understand books in Arabic on language.    Fischer's \\"A Grammar of Classical Arabic\\" is much more accessible to those unused to traditional Western grammar, even if it is rather less complete in its coverage. In particular, it has nothing on Arabic verse, for which you still neeed to use Wright.    As to editions, the Cambridge edition is really a bit over-priced (it always was expensive, costing 18/- [= Â£0.90 or about $5.00 at the time] in the mid 1930s just for volume 1!). Librarie du Liban does a hardback for much less which is at least as well produced and a sight better bound. At least one Indian publisher does a two-volume hardback edition as well. As for the unclear typography, that's at least in part due to poor reproduction of earlier letter-press printing.    Stop Press: I see that Cambridge have just re-released the book in a new printing. The good news is that the margins are wider. The bad news is that it's more expensive and they've made the decision to perfect-bind the book.	2005-05-27

He'd used the book to try to learn to read and write Persian as a US-born native speaker.     He starts: \\"Take it from a fluent speaker [...] Lambton's book is probably NOT what you should be looking for if you want to start learning the language.\\" And if you want to speak Persian, I agree!    Lambton's Persian Grammar is an excellent book on literary Persian. It is an academic work of the nineteen-fifties. It describes sounds well to anyone who can follow the standard linguistic descriptions (yes, it could be more accessible). It is hardly surprising that forms like 'bachegan' - traditionally the plural of 'bache', child - might confuse a speaker who doesn't know literary Persian since they no longer appear in the spoken language. But the book is teaching literary Persian, and if plurals in '-gan' aren't in, you're going to be very confused when you come to any pre-modern or very formal writing. And Lambton does indeed say that plurals in '-an' can always be replaced by plurals in '-ha' and almost always are in speech.    I think, though, that m_jawza's biggest problem is going to be that the book is fifty years old. Persian has changed a bit in the last fifty years! But by the time he finishes, he'll be able to pick up a ninteenth-century book and have a chance of understanding it (with a copy of Steingass - or the Loghat-name -  for all those Arabic and out-moded words). I'm not so sure about writing, though. I wasn't very impressed with the handling of syntax. I think for that, he'd do better to use Wheeler Thackston's 'an Introduction to Persian'.    By the way, I certainly agree that she packs a lot in one lesson. I too found the definite/indefinite description unclear. Lambton's book is a very traditional teaching grammar that can double as a basic reference grammar - indeed, it is the standard grammar of written Persian. I really preferred Wheeler Thackston's approach. But I use Lambton as a reference, and it is very good for that.     If you are wanting to use Lambton for self-tuition, two points, one good and one bad. She does have a key to the exercises, which Thackston doesn't. But she doesn't have a glossary - that, expanded, is published as a different book, [[ASIN:0521091543 Persian Vocabulary]]. Both volumes, by the way, are available at a considerably lower cost in paperback editions published by Chand of New Delhi that are actually better bound than the current Cambridge editions.     BTW, m_jazwa, please do come back to your review when you've used Lambton a bit more - I for one would like to know how you get on!	2005-05-18

It has a good intro to writing (and tends to use Persian written forms in the text, a good idea as most independent learners tend to copy the print typeface rather than learn a handwritten form). Why not as a first book? Well, only that the language is a bit out of date.<br /><br />So what instead? Thackston's \\"Introduction to Persian\\" is the first choice now for the written language, and for the spoken language either the new \\"Teach Yourself Persian\\" (Narguess Farzad) or the \\"Colloquial Persian\\" (Abdi Rafiee) would be better as these teach you to speak the language and have cassettes. But read the reviews. \\"Colloquial Persian\\" especially has big problems with the use of words before they're introduced, and I don't like the author's confusing use of colloquial forms in the Arabic script - such forms aren't usually written. Mace seems a better teacher than either Rafiee or Farzad, and only Elwell-Sutton's dated \\"Elementary Persian Grammar\\" (written Persian) does as well on script.<br /><br />A hint - if you can get a second-hand copy from the 1960s, the print quality will be significantly higher, the book smaller and (if hard-back) both more robust and lighter, ideal for the traveller.	2004-12-29

This was a BBC Radio 4 micro-course, based on six radio programmes, done by Rona Bengisu, who teaches Turkish at London University's School of African and Oriental Studies (the UK's main centre of such study). She also did \\"Turkish in 3 Months\\", which was the best Turkish course around.    Why is this so good? Well, unlike most courses, it had the BBC in charge, so the recording quality is second to none - it is actually broadcast quality. Secondly, because it is designed as a radio course, the book is there as a help, not as the prime material, so you work always from the tape to the book (and indeed you don't even absolutely need the book). So you encounter words as sounds, not writing, and there's lots of repetition, but not enough to be boring. And finally Bengi is such a good teacher (judging by her courses!).    This used to be called \\"Get by in Turkish\\" in the UK. The BBC has a new \\"Get By In\\" series, and they're not worth the money - they're glorified phrasebooks, and hard to use ones at that.

I thought I knew a bit about the translation movement into Arabic through Syriac, but Gutas showed me I knew nothing almost. Very deeply researched, by an editor of Brill's Mediaeval Greek and Arabic lexicon. There can be few scholars with such a grasp of Greek-Arabic translation, or of Arabic translations of Greek works. He demolishes some old myths - the idea that Ma'mun's \\"Bait al-Hikma\\" in Baghdad was anything other than a library is shown to be baseless speculation, for example - and provides us with a view of the translators that I'd have thought impossible before. The analysis of what was translated was most interesting.<br /><br />Who knows who \\"Jake\\", \\"Kevin\\" and the anonomous reader are! I see they - or he, as I suspect - have only done a single review apiece. If \\"they\\" are really disappointed by the work, it would be helpful if \\"they\\" did a fuller review of the book to let us what in \\"their\\" view the book's weaknesses are, supported by the text, if possible. I suspect however that it's Professor Gutas' public protests about the damage to Iraq's cultural heritage resulting from the war in Iraq that's \\"their\\" issue.<br /><br />For more general reading on the adoption of parts of the Classical tradition by the Arabic-speaking world, I can recommend Franz Rosenthal's reader on the subject, \\"The Classical Heritage in Islam\\". His introduction is excellent and the texts well-chosen.<br /><br />I thought the Gutas book interesting enough, by the way, to give a copy to my mediaevalist sister-in-law as a present.	2004-12-07

Levi, a classicist, poet, academic (at one time Professor of Poetry at Oxford University) and an ordained Jesuit priest arrives for the first time in and falls in love with Greece. As a classicist, he has an interest in Pausanias' 'Guide to Greece' which he later translated for Penguin ([[ASIN:0140442251 Guide to Greece, Vol. 1: Central Greece]] and [[ASIN:014044226X Guide to Greece, Vol. 2: Southern Greece]]) and which continually informs his classical travels. In a different, though complementary, area, Levi the poet meets and engages with many of the figures of the astonishingly fertile Greek literary scene of the period, meeting George Sepharis, encountering the work of Ritsos as well as other poets and writers perhaps less well-known outside Greece. The third level is Levi's increasing political engagement during the dictatorship that gives some pace to the mid-to-later part of the book. Finally there is Levi's own poetic response to Greece, never too far beneath the surface. Recommended.	2004-09-25

It consists of a series of nasta'liq and shakaste texts with facing-page printed texts and comments on the script. Given the immense difficulty in reading many Persian texts - especially in shakaste script or informally written without dots - this volume is of real value to anyone having to read original manuscript material in Persian. The publisher's own blurb reads thus:-<br />&quot;Most writing in Persian and Urdu since the fifteenth century from Iran, Central Asia, and South Asia has been in a style known as nasta`liq and its derivative, shekasta. In rapidly written, informal hands these types of writing present serious obstacles to scholars who need to use primary sources in their research. Although calligraphy forms of writing have been fully reviewed and explained, no aids are available to help scholars learn to read these hands. This volume is designed to fill this gap and as an aid to historians, literary scholars, and others who need to read manuscript documents in these two styles of script. It presents seventy six examples, representing literary, bureaucratic, and personal texts. The examples are arranged in a graded sequence according to difficulty. Each is accompanied by a printed transcription and a commentary on difficult or unusual features. An index of ligatures and logographic forms is included, along with a brief annotated bibliography of relevant literature.&quot;	2004-07-02

It is based on texts from the 1990s with a preference for texts other than high literature. In its 800 pages, it covers most of modern Arabic grammar and syntax.    As a reference grammar, it will not be necessary (perhaps not even useful) to the student until he is at least at intermediate level. The grammatical terminology is highly technical - there is a useful glossary of terms in the back - and has rather idiosyncratic variations from terms that have become standard over the last century and a half (e.g. the 'accusative' case becomes the 'dependant' case). This is annoying: more seriously in my opinion, no attempt at all is made to provide native Arabic terms. Grammar is illustrated by a wealth of examples, presented in unpointed Arabic script, in a formal transliteration (i.e. with i'rab transliterated) and in translation (sometimes two where the idiom differs vastly between English and Arabic). This is excellent, and mitigates my strongest criticism of the book - it is littered with typos, especially in the Arabic script. Fortunately with the transliteration, one has a check. It is disappointing that Routledge who, after all, are charging a vast sum equivalent to a Harissowitz or Brill book for the hard-back edition haven't tried to emulate the editorial standards of the serious academic presses.    However, despite complaints, this is a work that will amply repay study. I would still recommend the student to use a good teaching grammar - I like Haywood and Nahmad - before and as a guide to 'recommended' usage, especially as Haywood and Nahmad has reference to Arabic terminology (Wright could serve as a terminological reference for the more advanced Classical Arabic student, and indeed goes far beyond H&N in covering terminology). Finally, thanks to Routledge for bringing this book out at a price that a student can (just about) afford.    Karin Ryding's [[ASIN:0521777712 A Reference Grammar of Modern Standard Arabic]], which I thought might be comparable, is a fairly normal reference grammar of MSA.

Others, Al-Mawrid, for example, are useful as supplements, and contain new vocabulary, and there is a more recent German edition (5th edition) of Wehr published by Harrassowitz, but this book has a standard of scholarship unrivalled by any other MWA-English dictionary. Middle Eastern published MWA-English dictionaries like Mawrid, for example, don't give the grammatical information learners of Arabic need, such as broken plurals, verbal vowelling, verbal nouns (masdars), let alone how verbs are used with prepositions, all of which Wehr tells the user.  Words are in root order, so maktaba (desk) [mktbh] and kaatib (writer) [k'tb] both are found under the verb kataba (to write) [ktb]. This really is the most useful way of ordering Arabic dictionaries for someone who's mastered the basics of Arabic grammar, though an alphabetic order dictionary is a help when you're starting and occasionally even when you're expert.  This dictionary is NOT a dictionary of Classical Arabic (although Beeston in his anthology of Bassar bin Burd reckoned that Wehr covered the vast majority of the vocabulary of this poet of the 8th Century AD). For Classical Arabic, Lane (perhaps supplemented by Hava's much more affordable al-Fara'id) is essential. But Lane is useless for modern Arabic. And if you're reading mediaeval Arabic, you will find Wehr fills in some of the gaps in Lane.  This dictionary is NOT a dialect dictionary, though it contains many dialect words that have found their way into the written Arabic of Egypt, Iraq, etc.  Arabs don't write colloquial Arabic (at least not in formal contexts) and dialect dictionaries are specialized (colloquial Arabic-English dictionaries are usually written in a phonetic transcription rather than in the Arabic script). If you need a dialectdictionary, get one. This isn't one.  Other reviewers have rightly commented on the size of this dictionary, but some have confused editions. The 3rd (SLS paperback) edition was 114 x 162 x 45mm (4.5&#34; x 6.4&#34; x 1.75&#34;) in size, weighed 0.65 kg and had tiny 5.5 pt print. The 4th (SLS paperback) edition is larger: 216 x 130 x 40mm (5.2&#34; x 8.5&#34; x 1.5&#34;), weighs 0.8 kg and has 7.5 pt print. This makes the SLS 4th edition's print much more readable than the SLS 3rd edition's.  The 4th edition, which is sewn-bound, is also more robust than the 3rd edition, which was perfect-bound - I'm on my 3rd copy of the 3rd edition while my 4th edition soldiers on after 8 years. However, the book is not really pocket sized any more (I still keep using my last copy of the 3rd edition as a pocket copy).  The 4th edition isn't cheap (it costs much more in England than in the US, though). If you're in the Middle East, you can pick up Librarie du Liban hardback copies of the 3rd edition (it has larger print than either of the two paperbacks - about 8 pt, the size of the original Brill 3rd edition - and is very clear) for a little less. There's also a hardback reprint of the pocket-sized 3rd edition available in the UK, which has rather unclear script. It's a straight copy of the SLS 3rd edition, and is Indian. It's usable, but is the least satisfactory version yet. But I'd advise students to get the SLS 4th edition if they can afford it. If you've lots of money, perhaps get the Harrassowitz hardback - I've not done so. And if you've money and German, get the 5th Harrassowitz edition (Arabisches WÃ¶rterbuch fÃ¼r die Schriftsprache der Gegenwart).  [I have now bought the 4th Harassowitz English edition. The text is slightly crisper and half a point to a point larger, about 8 pt. The paper is less over-bleached, which makes it a bit easier on the eyes too. J.L. 2004]  [NB While I still think Wehr is an excellent dictionary and I use it by choice, the student studying nowmay also seriously consider the bilingual Oxford Arabic Dictionary. The strengths of Wehr still hold but the Oxford which came out in late 2014 is up-to-date. It too is in root order. There is a discussion of differences in the comments to this review.

This is a grammar of the ancient Assyrian language, by the way, not the language of the Assyrian Christians which is also often confusingly called Assyrian. Modern Assyrian is a dialect of the Aramaic language, and it is unconnected with the ancient language, which is a dialect of the Akkadian language.    I would recommend anyone starting Akkadian (of which ancient Assyrian is a dialect) to use Richard Caplice's 'Introduction to Akkadian' or, better, the longer and more detailed 'Grammar of Akkadian' and 'Key' by John Huehnergard which will give you a far better knowlege of Akkadian and which has the benefit of 80 years additional scholarship. The former is a brief introduction and the latter a teaching grammar: neither is a reference grammar.    This is not to knock Mercer's scholarship (I use his Ethiopic grammar every so often), and the book is at least well ordered and very clearly printed: it's merely that we've learned more about Akkadian since this book was written.	2004-04-25

Without a doubt Brown Driver and Briggs (BDB) is a phenomonally useful lexicon, and once one works how to work round the root-order, is more useful than alphabetically-ordered books. The price of this edition too is unbeatable. BUT BDB is a hundred years old, and scholarship has moved on. The current standard reference in English is the 3rd ed. of Koehler and Baumgartner's 'Hebrew and Aramaic Lexicon of the Old Testament' (HALOT). I would recommend students to start with BDB but to check contentious words with Koehler and Baumgartner, and get a copy when they can afford to (it does cost $150-$180 in the 'economical' 2-volume study edition). Clines 'Dictionary of Classical Hebrew' at over $700 so far, with 3 or 4 volumes to be published, is for libraries only.    I have to say that I use the Oxford edition more than the Hendrickson edition (which seems a straight reprint of the Oxford with Strong's numbers added), but recently I ordered the latter from Amazon for use in Italy where I was living (due to its amazing price, it was cheaper to order it from America than to get my own copy out of store in England), and was very pleased with the quality. Though it has Strong's reference numbers in the margins which are of no interest to me, those margins are slightly larger than the OUP edition, and so one has a little more space to scribble (both editions could do with more margin, tho').    On djdjdjdjdjdj9's allusion to the hishtaph'el interpretation of hishtaHawe, I must point out that by no means the whole of scholarly opinion holds with it. I do, as it happens, but there's not a concensus.	2004-03-23

If you need a guide to the written language, buy Hans Wehr's Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic instead. Dialect dictionaries are, like this one, normally written in romanized form, as the Arabic script is of little use for pronunciation, especially where vowel qualities and stress are concerned.    Examples:    English ...          Written Arabic ...          Iraqi Arabic    'book' ...          /kitaab/ written &#60;ktb&#62;  ...  /kitaab/  'dog'    ...        /kalb/ written &#60;klb&#62;  ...    /chalb/     'with'    ...       /ma9a/ written &#60;m9&#62;   ...   /ma9/ or /wiiya/  'there is'   ...    (no word in written Arabic) ...   /aakuu/    As you can see, some words are the same and could easily be written in Arabic script (/kitaab/), some have letters peculiar to Iraqi (&#60;ch&#62; and &#60;g&#62;), some words are different from written Arabic words (/wiiya/) and some words simply don't have written Arabic forms (/aakuu/). I agree that it would be convenient to have the written Arabic words as well but it would have been a lot of extra work (Van Ess in his now very out-of-date teaching book &#34;The Spoken Arabic of Iraq&#34; does so, and properly doesn't try to force spoken to fit the written Arabic but gives the written forms in Arabic script with vowel marks and the Iraqi colloquial in romanized form, which is a boon to anyone who's studied written Arabic at all).	2004-01-05

A useful little book, given that press usage is so often our main exposure to contemporary written Arabic when we start to use the language. It's certainly not a book for beginners, though. It's also intended for class use; when I used, I used it solo but feel I might have got a lot more out of it with a teacher.    There is an audio cassette available through Edinburgh University Press to accompany this book. Unfortunately it is tied to the latter part of the book, and is less of an aid than one might hope. I used the book - the cassette remained unlistened to. The cassette is probably a useful tool for a teacher, though.	2004-01-02

Ottoman calligraphy naturally strongly influenced calligraphy throughout the Islamic world, and in Arabic-speaking countries in particular. Certainly my two calligraphy teachers in the U.A.E. and Damascus had the highest regard for Turkish caligraphers.<br />As to the book, the introduction is the best I've ever seen: it covers the development of scripts, equipment and techniques,  composition of pieces and concludes with a piece on the training of a scribe. All this is done with constant reference to the 71 examples in the book. The samples themselves are not, as so often in Western books on Islamic calligraphy, selected miniatures, but instead are frequently pages in the body of a work rather than merely ornate headings. It is possible, therefore, to concentrate on the khatt itself rather than the work of the anciliary craftsmen. The reproduction is excellent. Each piece of khatt has a facing-page biographical outline of the author and a small commentary on the khatt itself. Works range from the late fifteenth to the late twentieth centuries.<br />Terms are naturally presented in their Turkish form, so Arabists may need to guess the Arabic spelling of the word - it's not hard (h = h/H/kh, k = k/q, s = s/S/th, final Arabic b/d can become p/t). There's a glossary and a bibliography of works in English and Turkish. Anything else? I'd recomend the hardback edition.	2004-01-02

This book contains seven essays, one each on Simon Ockley, Sir William Jones, E.W.Lane, E.H.Palmer, E.G.Browne and on R.A.Nicholson. In the case of Browne and Nicholson, the essays are a personal tribute of the author to his teacher (Nicholson) and his teacher's teacher (Browne).

English studies are traced through from their individualist start, through a mainstream, largely driven by bishops Ussher (he who computed the 4004 BC creation date, one of the most brilliant scholars of his day) and Laud (Chancellor of Oxford University), through Pococke's career to Arabic studies' decline as the eighteenth century approached.<br />Sadly the book has no illustrations: samples of the early Arabic founts discussed in the book and portraits of any of the men discussed would have added something (and at the exorbitant price ought to have been included).

Lambdin's own suggestion that the student copy out the vocabulary list - and indeed the exercises - in the Ethiopic script helped me a lot when using this book. But a friend who really found the transliteration an issue found Mercer's now out-of-print grammar a help (I prefer Lambdin's approach).    Do look for Dillmann's Chrestomathia Aethiopica from which many of Lambdin's texts have been extracted (it is reprinted together with another anthology in 'Anthologia Aethiopica', published by Olms in Germany and available from amazon.de. It's also now downloadable from the Internet Archive site). This chrestomathy does have a Latin glossary, so for the texts outside Lambdin, a Ethiopic-English dictionary might be neccessary, probably Wolf  Leslau's.	2003-07-28

I studied Syriac at university using the previous edition (the 4th) and found it lacking. The new revision does help clarify the language considerably, tho' at heart Robinson remains, as ever, a traditional grammar book (not a bad thing). For a student who's already studied some Hebrew or Arabic, especially one who is going to start by spending time reading a lot of vocalized Biblical Syriac, this short guide will be as effective a guide as Weingreen in Hebrew or Heywood and Nahmad in Arabic.     I think I would rather use Wheeler Thackston if my aim were to read widely in Syriac outside Biblical texts from an early stage, not least because Thackston uses Syriac without vowel marks (with an accompanying transcription) and you are unlikely to find vowelled non-biblical texts. Vowel marks are a crutch that it's not always easy to give up, as most Biblical Hebrew students will know. This is less of a problem for bible students as the more popular biblical texts are vocalized.    Both books are reasonably hard for an absolute beginner without help: Robinson due to concision and Thackston due to highly technical language. John Healey's First Studies in Syriac, now in a new edition (with CD), might make a better first book if you find technical language a big problem.    This book (Robinson) uses Serto script with Western vocalization throughout (like the Bible Society's Syriac New Testament: most older publications use partly-vocalized Serto), while Thackston uses the Estrangolo script (more widely used in current academic publications). Robinson's still in handy pocket size, and one can again get it in hardback too!	2003-04-23

The author has a unique view for a Western academic in that he taught in China, and there developed a vision of Egyptian seen in terms of Eastern brush caligraphy rather than Western or Middle Eastern pen calligraphy. But the presentation using a mid-Eighties computer fount designed by the author is so bad as to make the book virtually unusable for me. I really do hope he will reapproach the book with professional typographic help - if he is still in China, there must be many able to aid him.<br />If the reader simply wants to learn 'Egyptian' regardless of period or style, I must recommend J. P. Allen's Middle Egyptian. It is, of course, the language of a different period and uses heiroglyphics, not heiratic.	2003-04-23

The Hebrew scholar might consider starting with Muraoka's Classical Syriac for Hebraists (which I've not used, mind). But this is a good basic reference grammar, with the advantage that it uses Eastern vocalisation, which is rather subtler than Western and throws new light on words you thought you knew well. The print is admirably clear, and transcription is provided too. Best of all is the bibliography by Sebastian Brock, which gives a good idea of what Syriac literature is actually available in print.

Wright, one of the great ninteenth-century scholars of Semitic languages, originally wrote this book as as the Encyclopedia Britannica article in 1887; it was later expanded and published posthumously. It is good as a summary and should be on every Syriacist's bookcase. It is, of course, hugely out of date.<br />But for something rather more interesting, try Patriarch Aphraim I Barsoum's &quot;Unstrung Pearls in the History of Syriac Literature and Sciences&quot; (first released as &quot;History of Syriac Literature and Sciences&quot; and now re-released as &quot;The Scattered Pearls&quot; in English). It's rather in the Oriental tradition of rhetoric, and very defensive towards perceived attacks by western scholarship, but worth a read in addition.<br />For more up-to-date bibliographic info, start with Sebastian Brock's bibliography in Muraoka's Syriac Grammar, then follow with his annual bibliographies in the academic on-line journal Hugoye.	2003-04-19

Writing Arabic, by contrast, concerns itself wholly with the Ruq'a script, the script most Arabs use for their everyday handwriting. The reviewers are right in saying that some knowledge of the Arabic script would be helpful (no, neccessary) before approaching this book - you need the ability to make out ordinary Arabic print (i.e. the calligraphic Naskh script) - and the reader should use this book in conjunction with another book on the Arabic language. However, for the serious student of Arabic, I can't recommend strongly enough the use of this book as soon as you know the alphabet. You'll also learn to read other people's handwriting - no easy thing.    Oh, don't be put off by the 1950's typewritten English script - unlike the other books on offer, no printed Arabic appears in this book, just good handwriting. The others show a little scrappy Naskh script (an extraordinarily difficult script to write properly) and print the rest. The aim of Writing Arabic is to teach you to write Arabic clearly.    [Note Summer 2005: a new book has come out that may be a more user-friendly way of learning good handwriting: Jane Wightwick and Mahmoud Gaafar's \\"Mastering Arabic Script\\" (not to be confused with the authors' \\"Mastering Arabic\\"), which also teaches ruq'a.

I approached it with high expectations, which were dashed.<br />Why did I find it disappointing? Perhaps I was expecting a bit more content; instead the book had the feel of a book thrown together to create a book. This is even more true of his companion volume, 'L'alfabeto ebreico'. <br />The illustrations seem too small to provide a useful guide to the caligrapher, and tend to concentrate - like to many books on Arabic calligraphy - on the illumination to the detriment of the calligraphy itself. The book also relies too heavily on Arabic typography, which isn't really the same as calligraphy, and which so often breaks the canons of calligraphy, with the result of seeming both ugly and hard to read.<br />I'd like to have know far more on the tradition of calligraphy and the calligraphers themselves; a more focused investigation of the styles used and how they've developed; a useful bibliography.<br />All in all, disappointing.	2003-04-19

It works in alphabetical order, which is good for the beginner as well as for the intermediate learner who's searched through a root-order dictionary without success for a word. The major flaw with this book is that it's aimed at Arab readers and as a result, simple grammatical information like broken plurals or masdars is not shown with the base noun or verb. Learners of Arabic will find the root-order Wehr more useful, but if they can afford two, buy this too, especially as Wehr hasn't been updated in over 25 years while the Mawrid is frequently updated. (I own both.)     The Mawrid English-Arabic dictionary is perhaps the best available because, though the Oxford English-Arabic Dictionary of Current Usage is more useful to learners of Arabic for reasons of Arabic grammatical content, the Oxford is 40 years old and the language had expanded significantly. Again, buy both, but here the Mawrid English-Arabic would be my first choice (you can always use Wehr to look up the grammatical info).	2001-02-23
US	51696287	R2OIKNOACE3OH8	0936347309	321504958	An Introduction to Persian	Books	5	12	15	N	N	Excellent tutorial	Excellent tutorial, tho' it does not replace Lambton's Persian Grammar as a reference book. However, it is syntactically more useful and except for its lack of a key (why no key?) a far better approach to the language. Do use Lambton after or alongside for her more complete coverage of the language.	2001-02-05

It is restricted in its scope and certainly doesn't cover all Arabic music. If like me you're interested in the rather more limited world of 'traditional music' (my interest is in the 'ud) or simply want to know how Arabic music works rather than gain an overview of artists and styles, this is the first book I'd recommend.    I can also recommend the new [[ASIN:019514645X Music in Egypt]] as a general intro to traditional Arabic music, with an excellent description of maqams and a CD of examples included too.	2000-07-18

But... the book is a hundred years old and Modern Persian is significantly different, so don't buy it  expecting to use it for the newspaper.	2000-07-17

It is the most useful grammar of the written language for students at a basic to high intermediate level (most of my lecturers refer to it too!). The students at my university... have found it invaluable as a supplement to course books. The only 'but' is that because the book spans both classical and modern standard Arabic, it is not always clear whether a given word is in current use or not. As a 'teach-yourself' course in conjunction with the companion volume 'a Key to a New Arabic Grammar of the Written Language', which is how I first approached it, I think it is an excellent course for learning classical and modern written Arabic, tho' some may find it dry.     However, I would recommend anyone who wants a quick course on spoken Arabic - very different to Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic - to look elsewhere.    Several people in other reviews have mentioned problems with the print: if you find this a problem, try to get a copy of the old hardback edition (1965 Second Edition) from the 60's and 70's, as the original printing is very much clearer - the current edition is just a reproduction of this earlier edition. The book is also much more usable in hardback, and lighter too.	2000-06-03

Ths is the most useful book I've found yet for the intermediate or advanced student of Arabic.  While a grammar book teaches you all about morphology and is usually sparse on details of syntax, this book will lead  you towards the goal of writing idiomatic modern standard Arabic.  But to  the real beginner, it will seem daunting and over-specialized - it did to me when I first saw it.	2000-06-03

Read with caution.  It's worth reading Peter T. Daniel's review of the book on the H-Africa list [H-Net Reviews] as Daniels has a lot of useful things to say on the book which may not be apparent to the non-specialist in Afro-Asiatic languages.	2000-05-11
