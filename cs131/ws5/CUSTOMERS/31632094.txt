In his section on the Trinity, he is clearly trying to make some waves while staying within a somewhat orthodox framework and in so doing, fails to be true to the facts. His understanding of Saint Irenaeus' Trinitarian beliefs is lame at best and being a person who frequently reads and re-reads Irenaeus, I found Pelikan's view of his beliefs, outright strange and foreign to the writings and views of the person Pelikan so claims to be expounding.<br /><br />This might not be what you are looking for unless you are into the finer points of theology and philosophy. I understood everything he wrote but had I not already been exceptionally well versed in the subject I would not have known. For example, when describing the aftermath of the Council of Chalcedon (451) instead of giving a short summary of the events and then launching into the finer points, he just launches into the finer points. Before reading about Chalcedon it would be appropriate to know that Saint Cyril of Alexandria uses the term \\"OUSIA\\" (essense) in the same sense as the Easterners use \\"PHYSIS\\" (nature) and visa versa so that Cyril speaks of Christ as having two OUSIA (essenses) because he is homoOUSIOUS with humans and homoOUSIOUS with God while the Easterners would express the same idea with the word \\"Physis\\". He gives something like two or maybe three sentences which refer to that fact, and only very vaguely after about 10 or more pages on the subject.<br /><br />My advise is to borrow the book or to get it used, don't expect even a large amount of history, but only the history of philosophical ideas, not even the dates of the people who expounded them.

His section on Iconoclasm (the anti-icon movement in the 7th-9th centuries) was poor. He refered to those who venerated icons as \\"Icon worshippers\\" without really realizing who incorrect that is. Iconodule is a person who venerates an icon, one who worships an icon, though, is called a idoloter. Also, that he failed to cover the argument and counter-argument for and against icons was poor.

When reading his sermons, it can be tedious at times because he repeasts and phrases ideas in such a way as that it seems tricky when reading, yet very colorful and easily understood when speaking.  <br /> <br />The moral implications of the several sermons contained in this 'one sermon' are massive. The sermons all revolve around the story of the Rich man and Lazarus in Luke and he explands on how even the slightest of monetary pleasures should be avoided and the money given to the poor instead because there will always be those who need help; children, old and infirmed, injured and disables, etc. The lessons he teached by way of Christ are ones which we need now more than ever.	2004-11-15

Since were don't have many poor and average people's accounts, we have to settle for Joseph who does a pretty good job.<br /><br />The Barbary shown in the war is attrocious; rape, canniblism, fanatacism, pillaging, turning on one's own friends, etc. Josephus himself tells a story about how he basically convinced 40-some of his friends to kill themselves so that he could escape.

Each part of our theology is explained in accurate and good detail. The vocabulary is fairly simple, easy to read, yet contains extraordinarily deep beliefs and facts of theology. Metropolitan Hierotheos' writing allows for words of Christ to come to alive, all too often in writers, especially Protestant and RC, the words become dead, cliche, and repetative without meaning. Because he is a person of Christ and extremely holy, you can feel the energy of his person pouring out from the words on each page.  <br /> <br />This was given to me by a priest at our parish before he reposed (May God rest his soul forever) and is a priceless gift to me both for its content and sentimentality.	2004-11-15

Though Bede himself isn't a huge fan of the Celtic Christians, he does record a number of stories yet fails to every mention Saint Patrick of Ireland! He is a meticulous historian, though, far more than Eusebius of Ceasarea and that is why I trust Bede highly. It is unforunate that he died before completing more work than he did (aside from this, he only did a few works, each one is excellent, though). Throughout the work, Saint Bede constantly reinterates the lessons of the Gospel; kindness to everyone whom you meet, almsgivng, caring for the poor and oppressed, selflessness, poverty, and obedience to God.  <br /> <br />A must read for anyone who is a serious student of Christian History, or even just Western Europe.  <br /> <br />I also recommend this for Orthodox Christians.

Personally, I liked it a lot, but I don't think this is for everyone so I gave it four instead of five stars. It is a volume filled with beautiful stories from John Moschos' travels from either Constantinople or Mt. Athos, down through the Levant, and finally ending in Egypt. Some of the stories are obviously confusions of other stories which he has already told while others which he claims are visions, are probably not. An examples of the latter is that he will sometimes introduce one of the miracle stories as \\"One day when Abba so an so was working outside, it was at the greatest heat of the day and suddenly such and such appeared to him...\\"<br /><br />Other stories vary from a priest who wouldn't baptize women because he struggled with becomng 'aroused' while annointing them. In response, Saint John the Baptist appeared to him, made the sign of the cross over his groin and never again did he struggle with the problem. Please, though, understand that there is a significant spiritual meaning to all of these stories regardless of how funny some of them appear on the outside. For examples, the saints will always and without fail pray for and help as much as they can, those who call upon them. It is really a book for the mature reader but well worth it.<br /><br />Historical notes are also a big bonus. There is an entire appendix of them which I found extremely helpful and explanatory.<br /><br />I enjoyed it and found this to be very edifying in the simplicity, love, and beauty with which it was composed.	2004-11-15

When I bought my N-A edition of the NT I knew exactly what I was getting and that is why I bought it. At the same time, this is not just a NT in Greek like the Byzantine Majority Text or the Textus Receptus (Which is excellent), but it is a critical edition with nealry half of the page (the bottom half of course) being dedicated to variant readings and anything else which catches the eyes of N-A. Most of the variant readings, like 99.98% of them are so minimal and minute that one has to ask, \\"Is this even a variant reading in the true sense of the word? What is the point of showing this to everyone?\\" and it can be extremely hard to read.  <br /> <br />At the same time, there is a plethera of different texts within this one text and if you want to compare the Textus Receptus with the Codex Sinaticus then you can do that.  <br /> <br />Sadly, though, the Codex Sinaticus, for all the buzz 'scholars' make about it, it was really just a parchment that monks had learned to write on from centuries ago, it couldn't be used because they had been learning on it and mistakes had been made, but it couldn't be thrown away because it contained the words of Christ, so it was used as a lid of sorts over pots containing honey until a German 'scholar' found them, was extatic, and was given them by the monks, even though he thought he scammed them.  <br /> <br />I don't think I would recommend this to just anyone. For example, a person who doesn't have a good background in textual criticism or a person of another religion, might read it and think that the NT is jsut a mess that has been compiled over centires and we are completely lost as to what it 'originally' said when it is actually the complete opposite that is true. Make sure you know a lot before you read this. I gave it 4 stars because of the use I bought it for, but as far a general Koine Greek NT for anyone, I would give it only 2 stars.	2004-11-09

That is how I describe \\"A History of the Byzantine State and Society.\\" It is really a book only for the diehard Byzantine enthusiast. If you just want an introduction, there are other, smaller books by Treadgold which give a similiar overview but introduce you slowly.  <br /> <br />This work begins (really) with the ascention of Diocletion to the throne and ends with the destruction of the Empire of Trebizond in 1461. Everything is at least mentioned in some detail, though not always in great detail. It is, by far, more so a political history and without noticing it, gives religion far less a part in it than he really should have considering that Byzantium is probably in at least the top 5 most religious societies in history. <br /> <br />It is definitely more organized then William Manchesters trilogy on Byzantium but not as easy to read. The writing style is 'Fact-After-Fact' and he does an increadibly poor job of explaining the \\"Monophysite\\" controversy in the immediate aftermath of Chalcedon in 451 yet doesn't cover the controversy with Nestorius and Ephesus in 431 nearly enough.

Nothing makes a human jerk as when a sensitive wound is touched. So it is with the latest reviews here on this site. The fact that so many negative reviews are posted shows, quite easily, that it has hit a sensitive spot with Muslims when it comes to their beliefs and culture. Usually, when things aren't true, people just brush them off with the nothingness they contain, but when real evidence is brought forth, that is when anger begins on the part of the guilty. <br /> <br />     Most often, when Muslims are confronted with facts of history or the Qur'an they fall back on one, two, three, or all four of these arguments;  <br />a) They claim racisms, bigotry, whomever is a Crusader, etc.  <br />b) They fall back on the old claim of \\"You have to read it in Arabic!\\" and \\"You're taking it out of context\\" (Trust me, it's not nearly as different as they want you to think, in fact, it's just about the same. Second, b/ the Qur'an is considered by Muslims to be the \\"Eternal Word of Allah\\", none of it can be taken out of context, every verse is in context just on it's own, otherwise, it is the \\"Temporal and Easily Manipulated Word of Allah.\\").  <br />c) They just deny it flat out and then will often times get angry when it is insisted and/or further proven. <br />d) Finally, and one of the most common, they just starting making up things about the religion of the person they are talking to in an attempt to take pressure off of there own.  <br /> <br />     I don't blame them for wanting to do that at all, it still is wrong, though. I am earning a triple major in Religious History, Arabic Studies, and Journalism and can tell you, as a fact, that the history he presents in this book is, unfortunately, indeed quite correct. It really is rather un-PC, though. Many of the previous reviewers are fairly uneducated on the subject. At the same time, you have to be generous with them because they have been schooled in Islamic History in either a) Muslim countries or b) Muslims schoolsin their areas; neither of which would be for presenting anything which would make Islam look bad, in other words, they have been conditioned to think otherwise and reject all ideas which are in contrast to their own instead of logically analyzing and considering them. <br /> <br />     The fact of the matter is that from the very beginnings of Islam, as recorded by Ibn Ishaq, Al Gahazzi, etc. (Muhammed's biographers from very early on in Islamic history), fear, murder, rape, and genocide were used as tools for Muhammed to gain adherents. After all, who was it who massacred the Jewish tribe the Banu Qurayzha in Medina in 627? Who else massacred the Jews of Khaybar in 629 under the pretense of a white flag? By the way, who else was it that turned Medina (at first named Yathrib) into a police state? It was Muhammed working under the disguise of a religious prophet.  <br /> <br />     I must, though, make light of some comments in a review which I just read. The reason being is that this man blatantly slanders and lies about the author and history. His words are in quotes whereas mine have ** before a paragraph. <br /> <br />\\"Serge Trifkovic in his infamous book \\"The Sword of the Prophet\\" has gone far beyond bigotry and smear campaign against Islam. The notorious author has attempted to portray Islam as a violent religion whose adherent rulers committed genocide of ruled class, and that Judaism and Christianity are a religion of civilized society.\\" <br /> <br />**It is a well proven fact that Islamic leaders have committed atrocious genocides on those of other religions dating all the way back to Muhammed himself and culminating with the Turks. In fact, right now Janjaweed Arab Muslim tribesmen are exterminating Christians and Animists in the Sudan and have been since the early 80's. It is believed as many as 3,000,000 have been murdered, died because of famines caused by the war, and/or been tortured to death. But we can't judge, it's just another religion, right? Wrong.   <br />  <br />\\"Even a casual reader of history must condemn his fictious description of the world politics.\\"  <br /> <br />**I'm a Religious History major and I accept it because I know history extremely well, not to boast, though.  <br /> <br />\\"Civilized nature of Judaism can very well be witnessed in widespread and continuous ethnic and religious cleansing of Palestinians from their homeland in the name of alleged and rubbish biblical prophesy.\\"  <br /> <br />**That entire area was once Christian and they were eventually exterminated by the Ottoman Turks beginning right after the Crusades and up through the beginning of the 20th century. <br /> <br />\\"These Zionist terrorists have complete backing of Christian fundamentalists who encourage and condone mass slaughters in the name of a covenant with God. Whole world is aware of genocide and massacres committed by zealous Christian crusaders in the Middle East. If Islam had preached as much hatred as these Christian crusaders had practiced, Muslims would not have left Spain in the hand of Catholics\\"  <br /> <br />**The Muslims had to be forcibly removed from Spain, they didn't \\"Leave it in the hand[s] of Catholics.\\" More over, All of Turkey was once Christian, with a sizable Armenian population, enough that in 1923, 1.3 million Christians could leave Turkey for Greece. Those who left were the sole survivors of Islamic Dhimmitude, rape, massacres, and pillaging.  <br /> <br />\\"or India in the hand of Hindus after over 800 years of rule. Muslim rulers had resources to convert the ruled class or expel them from their homeland but were forbidden to do so by Quran. <br /> <br />**Nowhere in the Qur'an is it forbidden to convert those of other religions. In fact, just read Sura (chapter) 9, verse 5 is the most graphic. \\"Slay the infidels wherever you find them until they pay the alms and do the prayers [presumably to Allah]...\\" That entire Sura abrogates [Islamic doctrine of one verse replacing another] all earlier\\"revelations\\" condoning what had been peaceful co-existence with non-Muslims.  <br /> <br />\\"They did not follow the Jewish or Christian terrorism to slaughter and deport Muslims from Spain and Palestine. It was the sword of Christian crusaders, which wiped out the native population of America.\\"  <br /> <br />**It was those who claimed to be Protestant Christians who did that in the present US and Canada (Central and South America are a different story) and for the most part, it was disease, which wiped out the Native Americans before the \\"Christian Crusaders\\" could even get there. Second of all, if we want to talk about terrorism...Well, it's too obvious; I'm not even going get into the World Trade Center. <br /> <br />Also, another reviewer mentioned \\"rape camps.\\" That was not Orthodox Christians running them, those were atheist and they were not nearly as prevalent as claimed. Also, check back in history, the Turkish Muslims rulers and hierarchy in the area filled their harems with pretty Christian girls to satisfy their lust. Now that is a rape camp.	2004-11-09

A university student justifies the murder of an old woman who is a cold and cruel pawn shop owner. For the next few days the student, Raskolnikov, struggles with his feelings of remorse, guilt, doubt, etc. until he gives in for the sake of others, though he doesnt consciously recognize it and some might disagree.

St. Cyril is one of the main pillars of faith in the Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Churches and one of the Popes (Patriarchs) of Alexandria. After successfully defending the Faith against Nestorius at Ephesus in 431, he spent much of his time combating what was left of Nestorianism inside of his jurisdiction which was Egypt and did so until his repose in 444. He wrote &quot;On the Unity of Christ&quot; long after Nestorius was deposed and exiled as a way of combating the Nestorianism within the monastic ranks who seemed to be the most heavily effected by it in Egypt.<br />He is definitely verbose in areas, some much more so than others, which makes this work difficult to read at times and rather trying on the patience. When one can penetrate through that, though, then they see the full value of the work and the theology expressed in it.<br />He explains why Mary can be called the &quot;Mother of God&quot; or &quot;God Bearer&quot; (&quot;Theotokos&quot; in Greek) while illuminating, as many authors before him had, on how Christ prayed in the Garden while not comprimising His unity of divine and human in one being (OUSIA), how Christ can be called a prophet in His humanity while that not comprimising His divinity, and many more topics.<br />It is important when reading St. Cyril to take into account the letter of reunion between John of Antioch and himself in 433 in which Cyril validates and counts as equal to his &quot;One Nature in the Incarnate Logos&quot; The Antiochian and Greek &quot;In Two Natures.&quot; This is precisely needed since in the Alexandrian school of theology PHYSIS (nature) is associated with OUSIA (substance) whereas in the Eastern Orthodox, particularly Antiochian and Greek at the time (Russia and the other Slaves hadn't been converted yet) HYPOSTASIS (person) is assoiated with OUSIA (substance).<br />Both schools are saying and were saying the same thing just in different words. In the latter it is considered that action is needed to define true personhood and in the other (the Coptic/Oriental Orthodox) it is considered simply being a person (Hypostasis) is enough with one composite physis out of two with Christ being in two Hypostasis in the Incarnate Logos (Christ). Whereas the Eastern Orthodox say in two physis and out of two Hypostasis both recognize the difference and terminology now. This MUST be taken into account when reading St. Cyril's works.<br />I would also recommend reading the Tome of Pope St. Leo the Great which was written not even two decades after Ephesus in 431, it gives an excellent view using the Greek and Antiochian terminology on who Christ is in regards to His divinity and humanity and the letter from St. Cyril to St. John of Antioch (it's only about five pages long if even that). You might also want to read Fr. John Romanides papers on St. Cyril and the Tome of Pope St. Leo the Great (another five or six page one, very short but informative) in addition, they are very well rounded and informative, they even include conversations he has with Oriental Orthodox bishops concerning his paper(s). All four go together VERY nicely and each serves to express the other three more clearly.true personhood and in the other (the Coptic/Oriental Orthodox) it is considered simply being a person (Hypostasis) is enough with one composite physis out of two with Christ being in two Hypostasis in the Incarnate Logos (Christ).

I would go for a larger collection, even though this translation is more contemporary than most, there are larger collections available which is important so as to be able to compare and contrast the texts of different times. I wasn't a huge fan of it but I've read all of the texts in various different translations previous to this so I was able to compare in addition to having done quite a lot of study on the history, authors, and documents presented in this translation. <br />far more historical background is needed in this book so as not to allow these excellent works to be simply documents or writttings, but rather writtings expressing extremely important theology and facts or history. An antique vase is only a piece of glass in a funny shape until one knows how difficult it is to make one and get that &quot;funny&quot; shape and the history of the vase and the culture, ideology, and person(s) responsible for expressing the artistic nature which the vase expresses, then it becomes priceless. Such it is with these writtings, more historical background needed to be given for those less informed about it.	2003-12-10

Aside from the fact he was excommunicated for Arian sympathies shortly before Nicea and had some explaining away to do later on, his work is alright and because of him many philosophers and thinkers who otherwise would have been lost to time, as well as some letters, and of them we now know something. <br />Eusebius was a very bookish man, had a gigantic vocabulary; some of his words are the author's guess since they are to be found no where in even the largest of Greek lexicons, hid away in his study very often, and for the most part didn't spend much time with his flock. Right away he assumes everything he writes will be correct and brings along with him a number of legends such as the legend of Christ and Abgar the kind of Edessa. He even copies down the letter written by Christ to Abgar which is a strong testimony to how gullible he really is. His beginning introduction in which he expounds on the eternal Word of God, as I recall (it has been two years since I read it) smacks of slight Arianism. He is even known to have composed a creed at Nicea which would have united the Arians and Orthodox-Catholics because of its ambiguity and beating around the bush but was thrown out by the Orthodox (pun intended) for just that very reason; it avoided the real issues. <br />At one point in the work, as the Williams notes, Eusebius transposes the years and months of episcople reigns so 5 years and 11 months came out to be 11 years and 5 months. <br />On the other hand, he tells many excellent stories and passes onto us many important martyrologies which I found highly edifying. His writting is very comprehensive, aside from having many historical errors, most of which are in minor facts, so comprehensive in fact, that neither Socrates and Sozomen tried to rewrite what he did, such is the acknowledged superiority of his text. <br />I would recommend it for others to read in a second and without a doubt as long as that person knows something of Church history Eusebius, and how he tends to just repeat information without much thought (he was great at repeating information but in all honesty, he wasn't much of a thinker). Still, though, it is extremely valubable and in the areas where it can be verified by other writings of the the times he is in or mentions (which is the vast majority of it) it is an exact reflection of the Orthodox Church of all times and ages. Just beware, Arius and Eusebius had a pre-Nicea (325) writting correspondence in which Arius treats him like a confidante and friend and Eusebius is sympathetic to him. I don't think Eusebius really actually knew what the differences were which Arius innovated and was condemned for.	2003-12-10

Written as a conversation between subjects and the author, he has entertaining and rarely heard of facts to make situations more interesting than they would be in a text book.<br />The entire book is based on the travels of John Moschos, and Orthodox Christian monk, and a fellow monk friend of his leaving from the area near Constantinople in 587 and travelled around the contemporary Byzantine Empire of the late sixth century. They visit monastaries, holy sites, hermits, stylites, seemingly insane ascetics. One of them who was actually commanded by his bishop to desist in his extreme ways lest he harm himself while being crouched over in a 4&quot; high cage in the blazing sun for years on end. <br />Dalrymple follows Moschos in his travels except 14 centuries later explaining in detail and with sorrow the extreme changes which have taken place due to Muslim invasion, persecution, and denegration of Christian communities. Interviews and conversations with Armenian, Jacobite, Coptic, Greek, and Antiochian Orthodox (all one Church, just the cultural identity around the parishes) as well as a few Catholics, all but one of whom were Marionites, more than just a few Muslims (almost all of whom are Palestinians), a few Nestorians, and in Alexandria what was left of the Jewish community, too small to even have the minimum amount of males to keep up the synagogue services fill the pages in conjunction with quotes and anticdotes from Moschos. <br />Some of the stories are extraordinarily tragic such as interviews he has with Armenians and Jacobites concerning the rounds upon rounds of massive holocausts the Muslim Turks have wrought on them and are now denying as &quot;Christian Myths and Propaganda&quot; (such as the 1.5+ million murdered by the Turks in 1915 alone). Dalrymple even has a evening long conversation and stroll through the city with the Armenian Patriarch of Jerusalem at the time while he is told the tragedies anddiscrimination the Armenians, Christians in general but especially the Armenians are under going under the Israeli government.<br />Most of the stories, though, even when they are tragic, are given a humorous spin by the author. He is a master writer and is able to put the most complex of histories into laymen's terms.<br />Over all it is an excellent read, well worth the read and I highly recommend it. Of the 35 or so books I read a year, this is one of the best, probably in the top three.	2003-12-10

Every area of his scholarship (both from what I know and what others have written concerning his works) is as near perfect as can be. This is a standard work in most seminaries and is a must read for any Christian serious about their Faith. <br />What he explains is neither Roman Catholic or Protestant, he explains the Church like it was and still is in the Orthodox Church which is really shocking for RCs and Protestants that it wasn't either way but rather just how it is, if they know about it, in the Orthodox Church. That there was no Sola Scriptora and that the sacraments and lituragy were an integral part of Christian worship from the time of Christ on is odd for most Protestants of a non-traditional background. <br />For the Roman Catholics it is shocking to find out there was no Filioque or the theology which goes with it and that it was actually condemned by the Church at the city of Rome from the beginning of its introduction. Nor was there anything like the modern day papacy. That in fact, the Pope was just a bishop among bishops, all he could do was rule over the city of Rome just as any other bishop and could give a judgement to two bishops if they both decided to appeal to him to solve a minor problem of jurisdiction (a primus interpares), there was no Papal infallibility, cardinals, madatory celibacy for the priesthood, purgatory, etc. and how the &quot;Rock&quot; Christ says he will build His Church on, when read in Greek, is not refering to Peter, but is refering to his proclamation which all Church Fathers, even Augustine agreed on.<br />As a convert to Orthodox Christianity I was not at all surprised to read what I read, even though it's from an Anglican who still manages to surport Orthodoxy simply through telling it how it is.<br />I highly recommend it, short read, full of important and integral history to Christianity, a must read.	2003-12-10

Written by Saint John of Damascus in the late eighth century, it is a masterpiece. <br />He sets forth clearly and precisely from the Scriptures the difference between worship (proskuneo) and veneration (latreo), that later of which is done to icons just as one has pictures of their loved ones in their homes, especially those who have reposed. After reading this no one can say icons/images are idolotry lest they call God an idoloter when he commanded Moses to make graven images of Cherbim on the Ark, pomegranits on Aaron's priestly robes, and all the other examples of it. He also explains the 10 commandments ban the worship of images which is false imagery, not the veneration of true imagery.<br />John was able to write most of his works against the iconoclasts (icon destoyers) because he lived outside of the Byzantine Empire which was then ruled by a few successively heretical and insane rulers. John lived in Jerusalem, even though he was brought up in the lap of wealth and greatness in Damascus and was at one time a high ranking official in the Muslim Caliph's government. He later renounced all of that and became a monk and was able to write profusely because the Muslim rulers had grown so lax and lazy in their religion and wanted only to enjoy the pleasures of their herums and eat fine foods. When John did receive the Caliph's attention is was negative and resulted in him loosing his right hand (his writing hand) only for it to be miraculously reattached in front of the Caliph who immediately backed down and let St. John do what he would do, that is writing what he wanted and when he wanted.<br />The thought and force with which he wrote is superb and undeniable, even the few modern iconoclasts left around have to admit that.	2003-12-10

I'm not just saying that because the author is dead either. He's really comprehensive in the way he covers Justinian's reign and doesn't, as some authors try, to cover up the pressure of the implications and effects of the Coucil of Chalcedon on Justinians reign. He doesn't talk too much about the building, or rather, the re-building of Hagia Sophia which is somewhat of a disappointment for me. He gives great insite into court intrigue and peronal decisions and friendships which reveal huge amounts about his personality such as his friendship and appointment of John as what we would today consider the head of the IRS and treasury combined. Plus, there's excellent information on Bellisarus and his character. The author makes it clear that, as sexist as it sounds, Justinian and Belisarus were just trying to get the job done and their skanky wives wouldn't stay out of it which only caused trouble. It's a real \\"behind the scene's look\\" at the person of Justianian and the people under him who made the empire work. A great read, very enjoyable, and intelligently written.	2003-08-29

First off, I'd like to get started by quoting from Caesar Farah's book, &quot;Islam&quot;. On page 103<br />he says that Abdullah Yusif Ali's translations, though widely used, is not authorized by the<br />Umma, nor is it endorsed by any major and/or creditable Islamic institution. It's not<br />because it is a translation, since, Shakir, Arberry, Pickthal, Dawood, Fakhry, etc. have all<br />done translations that are accepted by the Umma (Fakhry's is endorsed by the Al-Azhar<br />University), but, rather, because it's a bad translation of the text. Yusif Ali's version is a<br />rouge translations with no credibility outside of Ali's words.<br />Aside from the fact that his mistranslates things to hide and cover up mistakes in the<br />Qur'an such as in Sura 4:12 when he translates the Arabic word for &quot;Children&quot; as &quot;child&quot;<br />to avoid the overdraft of a husband dying with a wife, two daughters, a mother, and a<br />father and it adding up to 27/24 of the available estate (every other translator translates it<br />&quot;children&quot; and an Arab mathmatician in the 9th century wrote a book trying to figure it<br />out and then ultimately gave up in confusion). Ali also thinks Zul-qarnain, or, &quot;The Two<br />Horned One&quot; in Sura 18:89-98 is Alexander the Great. Another good one is his trying to<br />cover up Mohammed's lack of correct information on the Christian Trinity in Sura 5:73<br />when he writes adds &quot;...in a Trinity&quot; to &quot;Unbelievers are those who 'say Allah is one of<br />three'&quot; as in, Christians believe God is one of three different gods or something<br />uneducated and incorrect like that.<br />Rather than purchase this one, I would buy the Dawood, Fakhry, or Arberry translations<br />because they're accepted and endorsed by the Umma.<br />I just have to write this to Khaled Mahmoud Al Anani, the reviewer who commented on<br />being given a copy by Amad Deedat (the only great thing Deedat ever did was die),<br />apparently he doesn't know much if he trusts Ahmad Deedat, or rather, implies he thinks<br />of him as a great person. Deedat wrote a book called &quot;The Choices&quot; with such atrocious<br />scholarship and horrendous lies in it, it can hardly be called a work at all. Among his<br />many, many, many mistakes, twisting of words, and outright lies is his lie concerning what<br />the Greek texts says in the New Testament in John 1:1 (I read Koine Greek so I know first<br />hand) and claims &quot;TONTHEOS&quot; in the beginning of the Gospel of John means &quot;A god&quot;.<br />Aside from the fact that TONTHEOS isn't even a word, (it would have to be &quot;ton theoN&quot;<br />and it's the accusative case of the noun &quot;theos&quot; meaning &quot;God&quot;) saying &quot;ton theos&quot; is as<br />incorrect in Greek as saying, &quot;Ain't got none&quot; in English, it would be ruggedly and<br />outright incorrect. As I recall, he even makes up a story about how a minister who read<br />Greek was forced to admit to him how &quot;TONTHEOS&quot; means, &quot;a god&quot; and that it's the<br />first occurrence when any person with even basic knowledge, let alone a professor knows<br />very well that can't be. Another one of his is claiming that Muhammed is the &quot;paraclete&quot;<br />spoken of in John 14, 15, and 16 and that it is &quot;proven in the Greek because it has been<br />mistranslated&quot;, trust me, as a reader of Greek, that is an outright lie; Deedat's books are<br />worthless outside of being used for toilet paper and fuel for the fire.<br />I have nothing against Muslims; I do, though, have a problem with those who lie (i.e.<br />Deedat), regardless of religion (one of the many reasons I don't care for Jerry Falwell and<br />his lackeys). I completely agree with the first reviewer about Rattemause, for God's sake,<br />get some correct information, whether for or against Islam. There are few things I despise<br />more than lies, blatantly incorrect information stated as absolute fact, and stupidity. I<br />disagree with Omar Badri on one point, though (aside from this version of the Qur'an),<br />&quot;ALL MUSLIMS DO NOT SUPPORT THE ATTACKS ON SEPT. 11&quot;, there are a large<br />amount of Muslims in the Middle East who support it greatly. Most Muslims in North<br />America do not agree with it, and, in fact, condemn it; but the fact that no major Islamic<br />Institution in the Middle East has issued a Fatwa (condemnation) on the suicide bombers<br />in the attack, but have remained largely silent either way, when they have no problem<br />issuing one on the state of Israel is rather alarming. I know that by saying this I risk being<br />called &quot;Anti-Islamic&quot;, &quot;politically incorrect&quot;, and a &quot;racist\\", all of which are wrong,  but<br />facts are facts. I have many Muslims friends and I can say from personal experience, most<br />Muslims are peace loving people, an alarmingly growing number, though, mainly in the<br />Middle East are just bad people stirred on by hate and inadequate knowledge to persecute<br />Copts, Jews, and other Muslims who don't agree with their ideology.	2003-07-23

Bishop Ware covers the absolute basics or Christian philosophy such as God as Mystery, God as Trinity, God as Creator, God as Man, God as Spirit, and God as Prayer. He gives complete and full logical basis for each teaching, belief, and action of the Orthodox, and non-Orthodox Christian. <br />It reminds me of &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; by C.S. Lewis in which he tells the story of how he went from a vehement opponent of religion in general, especially Christianity, to an Anglican Christian through philosophy. Not that Ware tells the story of his conversion, but that both of them use are utmost in their philosophy which flows so naturally and purely that it couldn't just be from humans. <br />One of the main reasons (aside from historical reasons) I converted to Christianity instead of Islam, Hinduism, Deism, etc, (the list goes on at the religions I considered, researched, etc. some more than others though) is because the first was so much more philosophical, contemplative, logical, and filled with love, while retaining the utter unattainable, unknowable, and unfathomable greatness of God. It was as if everthing just clicked together, the entire essense and meaning of the Gospels permeated and elimenated the 'contradictions' that are seen when they are viewed in a shallow, ultra legalistic and literal sense. I realized they were written to expound a meaning and essense of love, not to be a code of laws like the Qur'an is for Muslims, or the Constitution is for hicks; to be viewed in a legalistic, shallow way, taken at face value, and not having a meaning past the words on the page. <br />All I can do is to recommend this book, if it were within my abilities I would give a copy to every person I meet and bid them read it again and again and again	2003-07-14

Thoroughly done scholarship, yet she lacks the ability to draw concise and reasonable conclusions from the facts of history which she presents. The real problem with this work, though, is she fails to take a stand on key issues such as, was the Qu'ran created by Muhammed, sent by God, a little bit of both, neither, etc.? For example, she says in a number of passages how a Sura was \\"delivered\\" or \\"revealed\\" to Muhammed by Al-lah, yet, a few pages later she points out how Muhammed had mistaken knowledge of Christian Doctrine regarding the symbolic terms, \\"Father\\" and \\"Son\\" because he takes them literally whichs is seen in 6:101 where the Qu'ran (realistically Muhammed) says something to the extent of, \\"How can Al-lah have a son if he had no consort?\\" If God authored the Qur'an don't you think He would know what Christians really believe? So then, which one is it? Was it God who made the mistake or Muhammed, if it was God then God isn't perfect as the Qur'an claims, omniscent, etc. If it was Muhammed then the Qur'an was created, if not in full, at least in part by him or was subject to his editing of it, if it was indeed delivered by God. <br />Another example of this is how he confuses Mary, the mother of Jesus in the New Testament, with Miriam, the sister of Aaron in the Old Testament (both \\"Miriam\\" in Syriac, the language he would have heard the Christian and Jewish Scriptures in while on merchant trips to Damascus from Mecca) in Sura 19:27-28 and Sura 66:12 in which he refers to Mary as both the sister of Aaron and the daughter of Imran, a difference of around 1400 years. She mentions this, relates it to Muhammed's lack of knowledge of Christian and Jewish Scriptures, and then speaks of how God \\"delivered a revalation to him.\\" Armstrong says how the \\"rhythmic and heavenly enchantment\\" of hearing the Qur'an in Arabic means Muhammed couldn't have created it because he had poor pitch and couldn't rhyme well when he sang according to his biographers and Hadiths, then she tells the reader Muhammed was able to add more flavorful revelations into the Qu'ran when he moved to Yathrib (Medina) because he began to encounter Jews on a regular and firsthand basis and learned more about the Jewish Scriptures. This is why so many of the Suras from that time are introduced with phrases to the extant of \\"have you heard of what God did for Moses?\\", \\"Haven't you pondered the story of Abraham?\\", etc. which were previously rarely, if ever, heard of Jewish figures before he fled for Yathrib.<BR>     <BR>Other examples of her trying to ride the middle and not taking a stance are Muhammed becoming politically powerful, including political material in the Suras (which she again and again refers to as being 'revealed by God'), and being a political, as well as military lead, but not being engaged in politics. She'll make a blunt statement about Muhammed and then follow it up with a complete denial of a logical conclusion which follows from the premise. Whatever happened to P=Q, thus Q is irrefutable?<BR>     <BR>Over all, I'd read it only if you know a fair amount about the beginnings of Islam and the life of Muhammed but want another view of the subject. It's not very good at all, it has a chatty style, and great quotes in it but her irrational conclusions and very selective presentation of material is disturbing.	2003-07-12

The Western World, especially Protestantism and to a slightly lesser degree Catholicism, have fallen into the idea that miracles are &quot;supernatural&quot; or rather, something other than natural, which is to deny the naturalness and completeness of us allowing God to interact in our lives and come into us. There is nothing &quot;supernatural&quot; about a miracle, argues Schmemann, it is only when we loose touch with the reality of God in our lives that such things seem to be other than natural. We only come to grips with our real nature when we are worshipping God and participating in the Eucharistic Lituragy, no other act of humanity brings us nearer to our true nature because we are using and offering back up to God, nature, God's creation, in the way it is meant to be used; to praise and worship Him.<br />Almost as good as &quot;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church&quot; but for something which was originally just an essay for seminary students to read, it is truly excellent. Read after &quot;The Orthodox Way&quot; and before &quot;The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church&quot; since it will act as somewhat of a stepping stone for many people. Definitely worth the read though.	2003-07-12

All I can say is this, it's comparable to Issac of Nineveh's &quot;On Ascetical Life&quot; in its beauty, depth, and penetrating words of love, peace, and prayer. Just read it, this book will change you forever.	2003-06-18

This is a must read for anyone who truly seeks to know God. Quotes from the Scriptures and God's love fill the very words and essence of the seventh century mystic monk. Beyond all comprehension, only God speaking through a human could produce such beauty and love.	2003-06-18

Books	5	5	5	N	N	Precise, knowledgable, and scholarly	Excellent, no other author could write such a witty, intelligent, and apologetic piece on Paul. It thoroughly debunks the theories put forward by Hyram McCobby and others who put together sloppy scholarship, a grudge against Christianity, and the want for a 'sensational' work to their name so they can rake in money from incorrect and highly unstable views. A must read for any scholar; Jew, Christian, Muslim, or secularist.	2003-06-18

Nothing I have ever read can compare to the collection and compilation of so many differnt church fathers, councils, and heretics. Anyone who wants to know about Christianity after the last verse of Acts of the Apostles needs to read this collection. <br />The first volume starts it all off. Have you ever wondered what went on in Christianity between the last verse of Acts of the Apostles and 1517? You'll want to read this one and when you do you'll find out that Luther, Calvin, and the rest of the &quot;Reformers&quot; weren't getting any closer to the original church and the teachings of Christ than the indulgence selling, mistress toting, warlord Popes of the time.<br />The Didache, Ignatius of Antioch, Clement of Rome, Justin Martyr, Polycarp of Smyrna, etc. are all featured in this collection as well as the decrees of Church synods and the Coucil of Nicea. After reading the first one, read the second and third, they're follow up on the church until the time of John of Damascus in the early 8th century	2003-06-18

An excellent introduction to the Desert Father's spirituality, lives, and way of life. Great for the beginner or the advanced in the study of God, love, solitude, contemplation, and faith.
