She could laugh at his flirting.  She was too hot and cold to be a character to care about.  Derek flirted so rudely that I was so totally turned off to him.  I like flirting. His was dirty and creepy.   <br /> <br />The story line was too stupid to be believable.  Derek is this great spy and was totally unaware of his best friend doing bad things in front of him. How can a guy be a best friend if he had no redeeming qualities and apparently Sean didn't at any point in time.   <br /> <br />Here Lily works and trains to do the dog race and on the first day she is so tired that she allows Derek to take of her and feed her. Dah. Take care of yourself woman.  You've done this race before. <br /> <br />There is a sniper out there in the Alaskan wilderness. Does Lily protect herself? No, she make love in a sled and prepares dinner out in the open.   <br /> <br />For a hard bound book I wanted something edgier, to have a well written story be worth the extra money	2004-09-18

If the words about food was taken out it would be a short story.  It was padded with ridiculous scenes.  The relationship with Morelli was boring and almost to the point of I don't care.  I got very bored with Grandma and Lula.  They really need to be kept as secondary characters and their mouths shut.<br />I would have loved to see a book written about Ranger and Morelli with Stephanie left out.  I still like those two characters but fed up with Stephanie not growing and being better at something.<br />Don't bother buying a hardback book.  You won't miss much waiting for the paperback.  Actually I am sure that the discounted hardback books will be plentiful, which will be cheaper than the paperbacks.  It was ashamed for this book to be printed as is.	2004-07-05

I really liked the beginning of the book and the characters especially Shiloh and Sarah.  I thought that there was a lot of potential for the characters and future stories lines. But then the author fell apart in the last third of the book.  (Sigh) it was really very disappointing.  The other reviews mentioned &quot; true mystery, tension weaving writing and a thriller&quot; of a book.  I was disappointed at the quick resolves that came out of no where and then thrown in was some disgusting unnecessary twists that cheapened the characters that the author created.  The values that made them good police detectives in the beginning of the 37th hour, is not found at the end thus makes it hard for a interesting followup book in the future.  To be honest there was very little detective work was done in this novel. Eh, maybe it wasn't intended to be a mystery or detective story...the author needs to read about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike; Lucas Davenport to see what good mystery and detective writing is about.  <br />The ending was so sad  and poorly put together that I am not sure I care enough about the characters to read another story, thinking I might get cheated out of a good story and be depressed about spending so much money on a hardbound book.	2004-02-02

Usually the romance relationships are so volitile that I often wonder would I want to be in that situation; no matter how beautiful the guy is.  <br />The author didn't go for the rich guy and the girl who had only a tough moment.  The woman had a tough life.  She worked hard to make good choices and she learned from her choices she made in life. It was good to read that she got a job as a cook and did well at it. Other books I have read, the woman got the job but failed miserable as a cook for the cowboys and the men let the woman get away with being a bad cook.  Wow. How boring.<br />I liked that fact she liked being touch. Being tactile is so important to some people and the author did a good job understanding that.<br />Easy read and different from the usual out on the market	2003-11-17

I like much of the old Patricia Potter books, but this era isn't makeing the grade. There were so many repetive thoughts of whether the phone being bugged, people diving in front of others to \\"save\\" them, oh my goodness a horse being shot ( I have four horses so it was just how the event was overwritten), making dumb mistakes when there are bad guys out trying, maybe, kinda trying to kill people.  If the author took out the references to the above the book would have been much shorter. <br />There was too much telling and convincing words instead of a real story.   Save your hard earned money for a better book.	2003-05-10

I could not put it down and my mind was going and going to figure it out.  And at 3:18 a.m. I finished then reread parts of it totally enthralled for the next two hours.  It was very well written.  <br />Maggie O'Brien holds three jobs; she is young,driven with energy and cares about people which helps her to do well at all three high pressured jobs.  Her sometime boyfriend and best friend, Sean, is there for the release and but not always the support she needs. Her father, Tommy, is never there for the support.  He provides some of the high stress level she was forced to live with. <br />I really liked the action in this story and Maggie was either causing it or in the middle of it.  The best scenes were when she was with SWAT unit.  Her character was very well written.  All of them were.  <br />Negatives for the book are few:  I really couldn't understand the layout of the ER rooms so if you read the book try to get the blueprints of the ER as you read the scenes,lots of characters to follow and two questions at the end that I am still pondering over. <br />I hope there is another book of Maggie O'Brien and her supporters.	2003-04-09
US	51277138	R2SFXLPLJ5DK5A	0446612308	217462449	Like a Knife	Books	4	0	0	N	Y	Absolutely held my attention	This new author did a great job on her first romance/suspense novel.  I opened up my Amazon box of books.  Went to the computer to reread some of the reviews and choose this book to spend reading for my whole day off.  <br />Rachel has painful memories of her mother's violent death and her father's aloofness after the death.  I didn't need the father thing to explain Rachel's actions at all. Her passion to help kids that had violence in their past was groaning to me.  I think the author could have worked the need in by being a normal caring person that sees the need around her.  Or helping kids that need not to fall through the cracks of living in a tough city neighborhoods.  <br />Nick was very well written.  Not so hot of a guy the first twenty pages, not because he was a janitor, he just wasn't interesting. But he really picked up to be a hotty as the character developed.<br />The author didn't choose the easy way out on events she brought into play.   I liked that.  Otherwise it would follow suit to many of the romance books.  <br />I think this author will grow with a few more rewrites and the editor being pickier for not so complicated character building that doesn't work or is needed	2003-04-08

Most books seldom has the hero being simply a nice guy.  He was accused of a crime he claims that he didn't commit and he wants to prove himself innocent.  I love his scene where he takes Callie and Matthew hostage. Very well written<br />Callie is woman who is trying hard to make her life work by working her small farm, raising a baby that a whore gave birth to and simply surviving doing it all on her own.  She is likable, confident and doesn't waste time doubting herself and her emotions.  I liked this woman and think she could be found in the old west.<br />I liked the way the author worked Wade into acknowledging and then caring for his son and cooking breakfasts. It was a plausable plot. The book was well written with only a few lines the author should have taken time to rewrite and not be so obvious.	2003-04-08

The sex scenes were too much sometimes, but that didn't detract from the characters and their adventures.  I really liked the way Kleypas wrote Nick. There were a couple of characteristics that I have only seen in this book which made it so different from the other 98% romances.  I don't want to say them because of spoiling some discoveries for the new readers.  But I really liked how Lisa wrote Nick and what made him so great to his brother-in-law, his wife and his mentor (I'm forgetting his name that ran the Bow street runners after his brother -in- law left.)  I would recommend this book because the common man in England was realy sexy.	2003-03-19

I did not like the book.  There were some hanging parts, action parts that I scoffed at and the guy didn't have the ego that a surgeon has especially plastic surgeons.  I just don't understand how the other reviewers liked it so much.  I almost didn't finish it.  I actually put it down for a few days and picked it up only to see if something near the end would draw me in more.  It didn't. The guy I really liked was a black detective with blue eyes.  He was interesting for a bit.	2002-12-24

The women were not especially interesting which is surprising because of the name of the book.  But the three guys were very good characters that I kept wanting to know more about.  I would recommend the book, but would wait for paperback.  I just don't recommend too many books with hardcover prices.

I liked Jack because he wasn't perfect and rich.  Kristen was tough like a cop and not catty which many woman transported in the past seem to get.  It was funny.  Jack was really cool and easy to understand and eventually like.  <BR>The author did a really nice job with Kristen.  She is one of the likeable characters transported to the past.  Usually the women are so dumb, too sassy and think they are better than the folks in the past.  BUT with Kristen the author make the dialogue sharp, humorous and real.	2002-12-03

I would not recommend spending money on the hardbound version.  The author had chapters that were one and two pages long which means that words were only printed on half of the pages.  The format actually interrupted the flow of the story.<br />Any English teacher would give back a paper submitted like this and would ask the 300 odd pages to be condensed to 200 pages.<br />Don't spend extra money on the hardbound book.	2002-04-18

I skipped through some of it to pick up something of interest and found myself immediately tired of Kit being small in stature, anger, mouthiness and immaturity.  I couldn't feel comfortable with Baron falling in love with a person he thought was a fourteen year old.  It was really a boring piece of work that has been played out in so many novels.  I read other reviews and may try the author again but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Save your bucks since books are so expensive these days.	2001-12-20

I thought it was very good chemistry to build on another story line for the future.  Jordan was a cool character and someone like John could work successfully on a future relationship.  There were a few characters that I didn't understand what the power was for them to be in the story.  I think that the last pages should be rewritten to be stronger and a completely different ending.	2001-08-21

I tried liking this book but had a hard time with the main characters and in the end I thought it was obvious who the bad person was and still misleading hints were being bantered about.  I really didn't like how the author decided to let the reader dangle with the mystery clues and didn't sum them up more clearly or not at all.<br />There were lots of dumb decisions in the book by the support characters and the main guy.  One is after a boy was kidnapped and found how the parents let him out of their sight within moments of a reunion, only to be found by the bad person again.  Then again the author left us dangling by the clues.<br />Obviously, not recommeded by me.  I would save your bucks and buy somthing else that is more plausable and better thought out.  I mean the bad person was allowed to continue the killing spree because the profiler was too tired and worn out.  Give me a  real hero that could figure this out and get it taken care of. Maybe Greg Isles profiler John Kaiser could help out.	2001-08-21

Michael seemed cool but it was confusing what he did in life.  I liked Melissa in the first two chapters then her character became weird.  Of course there is nothing wrong with Sean Gaylen.  Iris should continue savorying his character and not blow it with a quick story.  I think she needs to stay away from quick writes hardbound versions and go back to what made her books really tempting and that was great character development, a suspense that was real and some heavy substance.  I wouldn't recommend this book in hardbound version.  It is too pricey per word.	2001-06-18

I eventually got use to it because I really wanted to read the book.  I haven't found any book out there about a man and wife working together in espionage.  Soul mates it what made me order this book.  There were lots of twists and turns.  I thought I could figure out most of them, but they were written well.  Maybe too many characters, although another reviewer thought the characters weren't confusing.  I found myself concentrating on them so not to lose track of them.  <br />In the end I certainly wanted to read more about the &quot;Maddog.&quot;  Everytime she and her husband were together I thought the scenes were particularily well written.	2001-02-12

I haven't finished the book yet which is wonder with the large print, spacious spaces between the lines, too much indentation on the page all for the publisher to stretch the book to 384 pags.  An English teacher would  complain to a student about the padding if this were done in school. <br />Now  for the story line.  I was jazzed about the story of a golden retriever,  John and Sarah. But there is no building of characters or words to help  describe the situations around them. Sarah is one sad person and complains  constantly about death in her business, I wonder why she is in the business  of finding people.  Monty is always sad.  (At least let him find someone  alive to build up his ego.) John, how can he have so much money and be so  in touch with everything.  Does he delegate anything?  The most interesting  character that hasn't been built up is Galen.  <br />I am a fan of Iris J. but  this books is so ho hum I wondered what the other folks were reading when I  read their reviews.  It doesn't even touch The Ugly Duckling or Reap the  Wind.	2000-06-14

The couple weren't rich; the story is after they were married; and they remembered why they got married.  His folks liked her and  supported her.<br />The character, Clay, was well written.  I could feel his  chest tightening; his lost of breath, the pain he felt when he lost his  wife.  I really like this book.<br />SPOILERS: (Meaning don't read unless you  have read the book.)  What could have been better was the police not  fumbling and bumbling so much; more credit to the PI; the bad guy employing  guys that lacked professionalism.  Too many oops.	1999-12-13

Then the first chapter got me hooked.  It is very well written with great depth to the characters.I really liked the small twists of  surprises.  Kit was a woman that was very interesting and believable for a  historical romance. Meaning she had spunk but was not an irritating heroine  which many romance writers do regularily and a reader is sure that the  heroine has 20th century tendancies. <br />The support characters were very  good.

I liked the premise of a woman enjoying the thrill and understanding the rush of being in the field.  Jane Whitefield stories by Thomas Perry is the one person that comes to mind  that makes a strong woman character.  I have written authors for years to  touch on a similar story line.  I love being on the edge of thrill and  enjoy characters that get a thrill also.  I was so happy that Niema didn't  do the usual string of thought and blame John for the decision to set off  the charges that killed her husband; or make light of the relationship she  had with her first husband. (The typical writings are the first love isn't  a deep and meaningful as the present one being worked on or they didn't  know each other very well and it was just lust.  She loved the guy and it  took time to get over it.) It just proves that she has good taste in men.   <br />I like that a woman character has good taste in men.  I look back on my  past relationships and the more serious ones were with good people. It is  nice for a character to show good judgement with something as powerful as a  mate.  Again, the usual twist in a current writing is for the woman to have  made bad choices in the past and now it is the right one.  <br />There were  some weak chapters that could have used some tighter rewrites:      I found  the character of Ronsard hard to believe.  I wanted him more evil.  Yes, he  loved his child, but he was responsible for the murder of 183 others.  Bad  guy.  I think Ronsard would have murdered a child with a good heart and  give it to his kid.I am glad John had mentioned  a healthier child might  miss getting a heart.  That was a good point.  <br />         I think that  Niema turning the tables in the alley was very good and it should have been  carried further. Have Temple escape to keep his cover clean; have her shot  they get separated and she works her way home somehow and then the last  chapter.  <br />           And going out into town after a few days on the  boat.  Duh!  Even I an amateur wouldn't have down that.  The best things to  do was to lay low for a few days, then get caught go to another safe house.   It was too rushed in the end.<br />I am ready for a sequel with the  adventures of two CIA people who are totally in love and trust each other  and then have adventures.  Niema doesn't need to say anymore how she likes  the thrill of adrenaline.  I also need 500 pages for the story.	1999-09-09
