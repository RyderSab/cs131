I bought Dr. Phil's book expecting it to be the &quot;ultimate weight solution&quot;, but the deeper I got into it, the more I realized that he wasn't telling me anything I hadn't read or heard a thousand times before.  And, shame on him for not giving the reader a dietary plan to follow.  In the end, this book is just a bunch of rah-rah-sis-boom-bah blather from a guy who knows how to make a buck.	2003-09-15

I read the first 150 pages of THE JESTER and, deciding that I'd already wasted more than enough of my time, put it down.  This is an awful and absurd novel that no reputable publisher would have touched were it not being shoved down their throats by a best-selling author.  I was taken in by the attractive book jacket and the misguided Publishers Weekly blurb featured in the NY Times ad.  It's been many years since I've read a James Patterson book.  His earlier work was fairly interesting.  Though marred by terribly misogynistic scenes (e.g. in KISS THE GIRLS the villian sticks a snake into a woman he's torturing and in POP GOES THE WEASEL a couple of female corpses are found in an apartment, one with her tongue glued to the other's private parts)and silly plotting, the books had a pretty high energy level that kept me reading to the end.  But, although he's still employing his short chapters, which are wholly unsuited to historical fiction, Mr. Patterson -- with the assistance of Mr. Gross -- manages to be both inauthentic and dull this time out.  For outstanding historical fiction written by a thriller writer one should turn to Ken Follett's masterful PILLARS OF THE EARTH and steer way, way clear of Mr. Patterson's latest effort.	2003-03-06

If you're naive enough to think that Wall Street is anything but an insider's game, read TRADING WITH THE ENEMY and have your illusions shattered once and for all.  This brief rip puts you in the seat next to Jim Cramer as he screams and threatens his way to a fortune.  As you'll see, this is one cat who'll do anything to make a buck.  And, while it's extremely entertaining to read about a guy who smashes computer equipment, throws pencils at secretaries, insults colleagues and manipulates stock prices, you come away feeling that he's the kind of toxic human being you'd never want to spend more than five minutes with in real life.  How Maier spent five years with him, I'll never know.<br />At least he got a terrific book out of it.	2002-03-05

After dinner last night, I sat down and read EATING WELL FOR OPTIMUM HEALTH in its entirety.  The book is drenched in self-empowering common sense.   Dr. Weil's advice -- and his recipes -- are wonderful.  He's made me realize how confused I was about the relative nutritional and health  value of the food I eat.  His plan seems to be wise and useful.  I plan to  follow it in order to lose 20 pounds as well as to boost my immune system,  and, hopefully, add a few healthy years to my life.  And, what's especially  cool is that he invites his readers to visit his web site   and share our experiences on his program.  All in all, I'd judge this to an inspiring and unusually wise book.	2000-03-09

In these jaded times it sounds corny and false to say that a writer just keeps getting better and better, but in Peter Blauner's case, it's the absolute truth.  Although his novels have the pacing of thrillers, I  consider them to be the very best urban fiction of our age.  From  &quot;Slow Motion Riot&quot; to &quot;Man of the Hour&quot;, Blauner has  brilliantly dramatized the perils and rewards of life in urban America in a  way that makes the territory his alone.   If you dig a great story...if  characters you'll never forget are your thing, make &quot;Man of the  Hour&quot; the next book you read.	1999-02-23

This  book does what all great books do:  it lures you into its world, holds you  there and doesn't let you go until long after you've read the final page.   This is a stunningly original work by a writer of extraordinary talent and  enthusiasm for her subject.  Like the flowers she writes about, &quot;The  Orchid Thief&quot; is a rare and brilliantly exotic thing that will be  loved and admired by all who encounter it.	1998-10-08

His novel has the characters, plot, pacing and  descriptions that scream &quot;this is the real thing&quot; to anyone who  knows New York City.  Ledwidge reminds me of a young Richard Price, with  whom he shares a brilliantly dark sense of humor.  &quot;The  Narrowback&quot; is for anyone who enjoys Elmore Leonard, Jim Thompson,  Peter Blauner or the early novels of James Ellroy.  My hunch is that he's a  writer headed for the big-time.	1998-09-22

Hall does.  The good news for his devoted fans as well as new readers is that Body Language just might be the best book he's written.  The main character, Alexandra Rafferty, is a smart, obsessed and rather lonely woman who is haunted by events from her past as well as a series of crimes that seem to be related to her current life. She's a wonderful character in the center of a plot that's arguably the author's most gripping and certainly his most mysterious.  Hall is constantly compared to his Florida brethren:  Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiassen and Laurence Shames, who are all talented, but none approach his depth, beautiful language or emotional intensity.  Body Language is a novel that reminds you that some of the very best contemporary writing and storytelling is being commited in the name of crime.	1998-08-05

His first novel, &quot;Stray Dogs&quot;, was a smart, nasty little noir, all full of twists and turns that kept Ridley and his book at least one step ahead of the reader, but in &quot;Love is a Racket&quot; he tells a great story and he creates some of the most memorable characters you'll meet in any recent fiction.  He's also got a wonderfully sly sense of humor .  This is a novel where someone's always the brunt of a con or a good joke, the reader included.  (Yep, and when you've been fooled by a master -- and Ridley is a master -- it's surprising how good it feels.)  Read &quot;Love is a Racket&quot; and you'll be reminded that Elmore Leonard's just a pit stop on the way to better stuff.	1998-08-01
