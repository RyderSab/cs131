The haunted house itself was terrifying. The characters and their lives and problems were unique and intriguing.<br /><br />Graham Masterson is the master of putting in little bizarre touches that make goosebumps go down your spine. He knows when to push full-throttle ahead with the horror and when to just be weird and spooky.<br /><br />He's not lazy, either -- he comes up with a full-spectrum explanation of hauntings in this book that is truly paranormal and extremely weird ... \\"Life is like a book ...\\"<br /><br />I promise you, the first chapter itself will grab you by the guts and not let you go ... if you can put this book down you're either sleeping or dead.<br /><br />Buy this book, horror fans -- you won't regret it!	2005-08-11

I bought it ASAP from the glowing reviews I had read about it, and at first I thought I had made a mistake, because I could barely stand to read it and it seemed kind of boring. PLEASE NOTE: IF YOU ARE READING THIS BOOK FOR THE FIRST TIME, SKIP DIRECTLY TO \\"STRIKE\\" AND START READING FROM THERE. Otherwise you might put the book down out of sheer frustration and confusion and miss out on an amazing literary experience.<br /><br />My first impression was wrong -- the book is far from boring. It is actually one of the best books ever written. However, I think Selby was just getting warmed up until he wrote \\"Strike\\", which will slam into the middle of your head like a fast-moving train. The first few stories didn't do much for me, which is why I suggest skipping them and reading them AFTER you have read \\"Strike\\".<br /><br />Just think of the first few stories as being the same as the first few minutes of David Lean's \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" when you first saw it. You can't really appreciate these first few stories until after the fact, much like you can't really enjoy the first few minutes of \\"Lawrence\\" until after you've seen the whole movie.<br /><br />This is not an expensive book, and you'll do nothing but gain from buying it. Read it -- you'll be a better person for it! You honestly won't believe how well this guy could write!	2004-12-02

To be honest, I was worried it might be kind of boring.<br /><br />Well, it was not boring -- it was delightful. The man was full of many profound observations about life that he communicated by writing about everyday things such as the birds in his yard or the weather. His vivid memories of his stage career and the people he knew were vastly entertaining. I was surprised to find him to be a humble, not-too-well-off everyday kind of man, not some fabulously rich egomaniac as I had supposed him to be.<br /><br />Even though I could not be more different from him politically, I still enjoyed reading his views on politics. It was like talking to a dapper, well-bred older gentleman you bumped into on the street. His writing was assertive, yet polite and genteel.<br /><br />If you miss reading this book, you've missed a simple pleasure that will make you smile. It's worth buying!	2004-10-20

You know, a movie like &quot;The Legend of Boggy Creek&quot; or any old 70's horror movie, for that matter?<br /><br /> Well, reading this book is kind of like watching a movie so bad, it's good.<br /><br /> Oddly, the writer is actually technically rather skilled, so the book itself is an easy, unjarring read. It's the wacky, zany, zaftig plotline that causes the raspberries.<br /><br /> I don't know for sure what I think about Amityville -- it scared the dickens out of me as a kid, but as an adult I have to wonder if it was just a lucrative hoax. Yet, reputable researchers like Ed and Lorraine Warren claim it was real. Maybe the whole Amityville phenomenon was true to begin with, then became exaggerated as time went on.<br /><br /> But never mind about the truth or falsity of the phenomenon. This book is worth picking up used. It will give some chills, some laughs, and a big dose of nostalgia for the 70's and early 80's.	2004-08-04

You won't be sorry; it's among the best of the best.<br /><br /> Now, do prepare yourself for the fact that there is not a lot of action in this book, beyond psychological action. It's a thinking person's book. However, it is quite suspenseful and the characters are fascinating, so you won't mind the fact that the events aren't happening at the speed you may be used to.<br /><br /> I gave this book four stars and not five because of some uneven editing in the book, especially in the antagonist's diary entries.<br /><br /> Overall, however, this book is top-notch. Read it and like it very much.<br /><br /> BTW, this isn't a &quot;lesbian book&quot; as it is often billed.

It's like stereotyping her books, and I don't like it. Sure, she has lesbian protagonists, but so what?

It would have been much better if he had just concentrated on &quot;ghost hunting&quot; instead of summarizing the numerous subjects he tried to cover in his book.<br /><br /> I find his analysis of negative hauntings to be especially superficial. I would suggest reading Ed and Lorrain Warren's book, &quot;The Demonologist&quot; for a more proper assessment of negative spiritual situations. I don't think a humidifier is going to do the trick in most situations of this type; although it is a very interesting fact that Joshua Warren discovered.<br /><br /> This is all not to say that this is a bad book. I'd say it's slightly better than average, and I would definately give it out to teens and beginners. Actually, it would make a good textbook.<br /><br /> I'd like to see what this author does in the future, perhaps in a longer, more focused book. I like his scientific, methodical approach, and he seems like a talented ghost hunter. I hope to see more of his books in the future.	2004-07-26

Other reviewers have pointed out that the plot synopsis is wrong, so I won't go into it. However, one thing I did want to say is that I was baffled by the epic phrase, &quot;twenty years in the making&quot; (??) that appeared on the jacket. The phrase led me to believe (somewhat nervously) that I was about to read a torrential hodgepodge of sweeping historical facts about Victorian England. I mean, not even &quot;A Stolen Tongue&quot; was twenty years in the making ... it's an odd thing to put on a book jacket, more of a film thing and very misleading.<br />The book jacket aside, this is a very good book and it was hard to put it down. In fact, it is so good that I found myself compulsively reading it until I was done.<br />The characters and drama in the story are right on the money. The historical facts add, rather than detract, from the narrative (it does not feel like the author was trying to cram &quot;twenty years&quot; of research into one novel, which is what I feared when I read the book jacket).<br />The only issues I had with the book were, 1. What was the point of Sugar's eczema? It was not developed to any conclusion.  2.Why in the world would Sugar agree to move into her keeper's house and lose all of her money and status? It made no sense for a survivor like Sugar. 3.Why did Sugar suddenly want the kid and call it &quot;hers&quot;?? that also was too abrupt and made no sense.<br />These small issues aside, this is one d*mn good read. Pick it up -- you won't regret it.	2004-07-15

This book really feels like a hastily collected jumble of lecture notes and letters. Obviously, it is only his impressive educational background and standing in British academia that allowed this book to even make it through a publisher's door.<br />If Mr. Sheldrake wants to write a scientific treatise on a metaphysical topic, he would do well to emulate Dr. Susan Blackmore, who always has her science in place before she puts forth an idea and who does not engage in rambling and guessing.<br />Finally, the idea that waking up before your alarm clock goes off is some form of &quot;precognition&quot; (as Mr. Sheldrake postulates) is ludicrous.<br />Don't waste your time. If you really do have an interest in this topic, try reading Robert Monroe's books instead.	2004-07-14

It's understandable that most people would dismiss a book like this out of hand. However, considering that this book really does stand in a league of its own, it would be the reader's loss to give this a miss.<br />I've read widely in many genres including the &quot;ghost/spirit&quot; genre. As a librarian, it has been my job to review non-fiction books of all varieties and judge them for quality. I also have a bit of an interest in the topic personally. So, when I say this book is most recommended, and is in fact in my Top Ten Non-Fiction List, I sincerely mean what I am saying.<br />I know that the subject seems a bit ... cheesy. Frankly, it's been done to death (no pun intended), but it has never been done RIGHT until Mr. Brittle's book came along. Conjecture, sensationalism, cornyness, New Age claptrap -- I wouldn't blame you if you thought this book was just another lame &quot;Magic for Dummies&quot; type offering. HOWEVER:<br />1. This book was meticulously researched and documented.<br />2. This book does not contain anything remotely cheesy. In fact, the cases in this book are explored with a brisk, no-nonsense tone.<br />3. The pictures included are worth seeing.<br />4. Ed and Lorraine Warren did not collect phat paychex for going into haunted houses. In fact, they did all of their work for free. Contrast that with many of the so-called &quot;psychic researchers&quot; we see on TV today.<br />5. This book reads more like a textbook than it does anything else.<br />6. This book does not try to push religion or in fact any viewpoint down the reader's throat. The facts are presented and you are left to make up your own mind.<br />7. Ed and Lorraine kick b*tt and make no apologies for their beliefs.<br />I was very happy to see this book available on Amazon, as it was out of print for years and the only copy I could find was on Alibris for $100.<br />I would say, buy this book while you can. You'll thank me -- and you'll thank Gerald Brittle, Ed, and Lorraine for being forthright about this much-maligned topic.forthright about this much-maligned topic.	2004-06-30

In addition, the violence described in the book is sickeningly real enough (and historically accurate, unfortunately) that this factor alone propels this book out of the \\"romance\\" genre.<br />IMHO, the only off note in this book was the strangely quick way Helen became a Queen. The reader was not adequately prepared for this, and so it seems a bit unbelievable.<br />But all in all, if you're looking for a page-turning weekend book, definately pick this one up. It's a quick read, and you don't have to enjoy historical fiction to get your money's worth out of this one.	2004-06-29

For someone like me who can literally read a book in just a few hours, this was a happy feeling, because I am rapidly running out of books to read!<br />However (you knew there was going to be a however, didn't you?) ...<br />&quot;Shutter Island&quot; was so-so, and THIS book was, well, just awful. How in the world did this guy write &quot;Mystic River&quot;, which is a masterpiece and is technically flawless, yet crank out a limping book like &quot;Gone, Baby, Gone&quot;?<br />At first, I enjoyed this book, as the pacing was fast, the story was fresh, the characterizations were right on, and the writing was technically tight. Then, around the time that the female sidekick breaks into a criminal's place to wire it (ummm .... OK), the story simply fell apart. I could no longer tell what the heck was going on.<br />Then, even worse, the book started tasting dated, as Lehane threw in mid-90's and even early-90's references galore, such as references to Ren-N-Stimpy. What the ... ? I know he wrote the book mid-90's, but as every author knows, unless you are writing a historical novel, you don't put in pop references unless you want your work to age like brie from K-Mart. That is one reason why &quot;Mystic River&quot; will be around for centuries. There are no cheap pop references in it whatsoever.<br />Then, Lehane gets on his VERY high horse about &quot;save the children&quot; or whatnot and the suspension of disbelief is wrecked. I agree with his sentiments but not with his heavy-handed writing technique. It just doesn't work.<br />THEN, and IMHO worst of all, the female detective gets the baby-rabies, and starts moaning on and on about &quot;creating a beautiful baby with love energy&quot; or some such claptrap. It just made no sense at all. A hard-boiled private detective acting this way, with no warning whatsoever? Maybe if he had worked it into the story a little more, but as it stands, it's not plausible. Maybe if she was cracking up or something; I just don't know. He never explains or justifies it, and that's why I finally put the book down.<br />I think this book may have been part of some MFA project of Lehane's, as it screams, &quot;I have an MFA in creative writing!&quot; I dunno about that though. All I know is that this book does not live up to the hype, and does not live up to the talent level Lehane displayed so beautifully in &quot;Mystic River&quot;.<br />If you like good writing, avoid this book.way, with no warning whatsoever?

Maybe, but not with &quot;Shutter Island&quot;, where Lehane goes from great to good for lack of an editor.<br />The storyline and narrative of this book are flawless; so are the characterization and dialogue. In fact, the plot is mind-blowing -- even after finishing this book, it will be hard to get it out of your head.<br />However, this book has a rushed, half-done feel to it, like it was a first draft and got rushed to publication without a good editing. There are some oddball similes and metaphors in it that an editor would have attacked with a red pen. Also, the reader is not fully informed about the hurricane being on its way; so when it does arrive, you could find yourself flipping back a few pages and scratching your head -- &quot;Huh? There's a hurricane all of a sudden?&quot; Also, the end of the book, when the orderlies unroll the white cloth, is confusing. What's in the white cloth? I don't get it. It did spook me out, though; so it was at least partially effective.<br />All of these issues would have, and should have, frankly, been fixed by a decent editing job, but I don't think this book was given the pleasure.<br />I don't think Lehane is alone. Actually, I think this lack of editing is some sort of current trend in book publishing, maybe having to do with the downsizing at big publishing houses.<br />Anyway --  this book is recommended, especially if you are a Lehane fan. It's a good, decent read.	2004-06-22

Excuse me, but all of the vegetarians I know (including myself) are the most discreet people on earth when it comes to not eating meat and would not dream of even disclosing that we are vegetarians if we are guests somewhere; preferring to come up with some polite excuse not to eat the dish served or to simply say nothing at all and push the food around the plate to make it seem like we did indeed eat. In fact, we often find *ourselves* on the receiving end of unprovoked &quot;holier-than-thou&quot; verbal attacks from anti-vegetarian people such as Mr. Stein as our intelligence, personalities, and very souls are attacked by people who are very defensive about vegetarianism for some reason.<br />The fact that there are more female vegetarians than male vegetarians and the fact that being vegetarian is seen as a &quot;feminine&quot; characteristic in our society surely added fuel to Mr. Stein's petulant fire.<br />In a man's world, this is a great book.

It is one of the more straightforward and easy-to-follow Straub books, too, so it's a good choice for Peter Straub beginners.<br />However -- and you knew there was going to be a however, didn't you? This book highlights my ongoing problem, not with Peter Straub's writing, which is technically superb, but is off thematically when it comes to his female characters.<br />Mr. Straub has a bad case of what we called in college the Madonna - (word I can't type here) complex, otherwise known as the good-girl/bad-girl dichotomy. His female characters are all either powerless \\"good\\" little virgin-types or powerful \\"bad\\", sex-crazed types. Sometimes he'll take a \\"good\\" girl and make her \\"bad\\" (and therefore powerful) by making her unrealistically promiscuous.<br />Just look at Maggie. I mean, come ON. Would she really just hop in bed with two of the main characters whenever they snap their little fingers? But as soon as she does it, she becomes one tough manga chick. Look at the doctor's wife -- she is \\"frigid\\" and therefore it's OK for him to leave her and go to bed with Maggie. Huh?<br />You see this issue happening over and over in his work, including in the books \\"Mystery\\", \\"If You Could See Me Now\\", and especially \\"The Hellfire Club\\".<br />I also have an issue with the way he implies that the women being killed in sex shows in a certain third world county sort of enjoy being killed (???!!!???). I mean, I know he is trying to be poetic, but it just doesn't pay off, not with the subject matter in mind. For such an epic, important subject, you should be able to make it pay off in a big way for the reader, and if it doesn't, you should just nix it out of your story, don't you think?<br />Anyway -- this is all not to say that this is not a brilliant book. It is. You will find yourself racing through the pages, and he has a lot of important things to say. I just wish he would go ahead and resolve his issues with women. I think that would make his books even better -- and that's saying something.oks even better -- and that's saying something.	2004-06-18

Even more rarely does a voice emerge that resounds like the voices of past great authors but that also shines with a distinct flavor of its own.<br />This is one such voice.<br />Told in second person, present tense, but never intimidating or &quot;artsy&quot;, this writer's prose weaves back and forth between characters and situations, yet always keeps the reader as an intimate confidant.<br />I don't want to say too much more for fear of spoiling this amazing book, which is surely one of the top ten books in the historical drama genre. All I can say is -- read this book, think about this book, discuss this book; support this fabulous new author to become as famous as she deserves.	2004-06-17

In fact, I've ranked the \\"Dark Tower\\" series up there with \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". I put Mr. King in company with Hemingway, Jackson, and Poe. Therefore, it is painful for me to write this negative review. Very painful. On both my mind and my wallet.<br />Let's start with the wallet part. The day this book came out, I reserved my copy at the local bookshop, drove 45 minutes out of my way (gas = $2 a gallon) to pick it up after a long day at work, and shelled out my $20 happily. Can I have my money back, please?<br />Now, let's go on to the mind part. My imagination has been insulted. Just because Stephen King is a famous and rich guy, is it really OK for him to publish this unedited first draft and call it a novel? Is is acceptable for him to break every rule he laid out in \\"On Writing\\"? Is his \\"basement guy\\" on a leave of absence?<br />If you want an example of what I am complaining about, try this: make a list of how many times he uses the same adjective and/or adverb on the same page. You will be surprised and dismayed. Lazy writing! Is there a red Sharpie marker in the house?<br />Next, admit to yourself that this book is as dry and unappetizing as a three-week-old Ritz cracker. Why? Besides the lazy writing, cardboard characters, and other hallmarks of an uninvolved author, he TELLS and does not SHOW at least half of the action. Over and over again, he writes things like \\"She was extremely afraid.\\" Huh?? What happened to the Mr. King who SHOWED us terror in stories such as \\"The Mangler\\" and books such as \\"Misery\\"?<br />Now, let's move on to the horrible New-Age metaphors he is unaccountably using in this book. By this, I am referring to Susannah's Inner Child as a Robbie the Robot Control Room device. Well, I'm being somewhat sarcastic, but if you've read this excuse for a book, you'll know what I mean.<br />Why is this book written in little chunks? Is this supposed to build suspense, or is it simply that Mr. King was too nonchalant to continue the narrative threads?<br />I am appalled. I thought \\"Hearts in Atlantis\\" and \\"Dreamcatcher\\" were just aberrations. Now, I'm starting to think that Stephen King would publish his laundry list if he thought it would make money.<br />He even caused Roland, one of the most fascinating characters to emerge in American literature, to become boring.<br />I have to wonder: Did Stephen King even write this meandering tract? His fine and distinctive voice seems absent. I would like to think that it was a ghost writer who cranked this out, but alas. I suppose all good things must come to an end, including a good story, and we haven't even reached the Tower yet ...xcuse for a book, you'll know what I mean.<br />Why is this book written in little chunks?

He simply can't write a bad book. He doesn't have it in him. However, like the rest of us mortals, I think sometimes he just gets tired, and can't rise to the level of master of horror that he nearly always obtains. A book like &quot;Lost Boy, Lost Girl&quot; is the result of Peter Straub on an off day. It's a good book; but not excellent like &quot;Koko&quot; or &quot;Floating Dragon&quot;.<br />The plot jumps a bit -- some things are not explained as well as they should be. Again, we have a &quot;haunted&quot; house; I wish sometimes he would move beyond this metaphor. We have a few character types that we have seen before as well; for example, here in this book we have another &quot;Davey&quot;.<br />Yet this book is still a million times better than most of the other horror novels on the shelf these days. Read it, but don't expect TOO much. It's very light.	2004-06-07

However, this particular book, \\"Romancing Mister Bridgerton\\", is not her best.<br />I'm not saying it's bad ... you won't put this book away unfinished. However, you may find yourself to be annoyed by this book along the way.<br />She does a lot of cutesy (asides) in the first chapter. It was bad writing and I'm surprised it wasn't edited out.<br />The dialogue in the book overall is too self-consciously precious, and the characters sound too awkwardly witty. It's simply not believable! The book is devoid of sensuality because Ms. Quinn is too busy trying to be cute.<br />I liked the Whistledown stuff -- it's impossible not to like! --and it was fun how Ms. Quinn borrowed from other genre authors.<br />However, the book is very light, self-conscious fare, and you don't really feel compelled to turn the pages the way you do with Ms. Quinn's other offerings.<br />Ms. Quinn plays a cheap trick on the readers at the end, using the mysterious actions of one of her characters to keep her readers hanging. OK, I'll admit her dime novel technique worked -- I'll pick up the next book for sure -- but it wasn't really a shining example of good writing.<br />I don't know ... I just expect more from Ms. Quinn. Better luck next time, I guess!	2002-08-16

In fact, it was more than hard -- it was a nightmare ninety-nine percent of the time, especially for women and the poor. If you're expecting a larkish or sexy romp through Jolly Olde England, look elsewhere. This book will slice you to the bone.<br />This book affected me so deeply that I finished it days ago, yet I am still haunted by it.<br />Ms. Donoghue has created a tale that is absolutely SOAKED in unflinching truth. Her historical detail is so fascinating and at times, properly horrifying, that you will be shaken to your soul, yet you will not be able to look away.<br />The many themes skillfully woven throughout the book are powerful: mother-daughter ironies, the issues of slavery and servitude, injustice, the servitude of women, sexual politics, poverty, the haves versus the have-nots, humanity's general cruelty -- each issue is skillfully explored without one hint of judgement or preachiness. In fact, this book is all about the story; nothing more, nothing less.<br />Mary herself is an enigma. Why did she make the choices she did; what made her so strong that she tried to create a new pattern for her life? Was she insane when she committed her crime? Did her lifetime of gruesome, heart-wrenching experiences cause her to lose her mind?<br />The final scene of the book is so powerful that I am getting shivers just thinking about it.<br />I wish I could explain what makes this novel so very compelling; but I don't have the words for it. All I can say is that here is a shimmering treasure of a novel. Pass it up and you'll be missing a rare opportunity to be one of the first readers of what is sure to become a classic for centuries to come.	2002-07-30

I found myself staying up hours past my bedtime, fascinated by the plot twists, the writing, and the amazingly well-executed parallel universes concept. The tower scene and aftermath are sheer, dark genius.<br />In fact, much of the book is sheer genius and packed with eye-popping, yet subtle, surprises. However, the problem with this book is the problem I find in all of Koontz's works: his interjections of cuteness into his narratives.<br />Ugh! I tried, but I couldn't stand the cutesy names: Celestina, Angel, etc. I couldn't stomach the improbable, Hallmark moment relationship between the single mom and the Good Doctor. When Angel yapped on and on about Oreos, I wanted to throw my book across the room. When Bart made his oh-so-precious remarks about Life, the Universe, and Everything, I was usually enlightened, but sometimes extremely irritated. A little of the out-of-the-mouths-of-babes technique goes a LOOOOONG way.<br />The baby-talk scenes between Bart and Agnes and Celestina and Angel went on for pages and pages and were so annoying and cloying that I skipped over as much of the pointless, syrupy, nursery-school dialogue as I could.<br />The private detective and his dentist wife also provided more than their share of too-precious moments. I could have done without any restaurant scenes between the two of them.<br />Frankly, by the end of the book, I was so annoyed by Celestina (the perfect minister's daughter, single mom, and painter), the inanely babbling Angel, and the other syrupy characters that I was rooting for the bad guy to wipe them all out.<br />In addition, I didn't feel any sympathy for a certain women who is killed near the beginning of the book (I don't want to give anything away). Just the fact that she sang those two songs the author mentions, and seems to have spent all of her time warbling about the goodness of life and keeping a breathtakingly gloriously happy diary, were enough to turn her into an unsympathetic character to me. Ugh.<br />There's no denying that Koontz writes a good tale that keeps the pages turning well past bedtime.

I don't know why people are complaining about this book. Did the time lapse bewteen Ms. Auel's last book and this one cause some people to forget that prehistoric times were different from today's world?<br />Yes, personal character introductions are repeated in this book. That's because in the prehistoric world there was no television, radio, or Internet to spread information about unknown individuals. Introductions were also used to show honor and respect. Ms. Auel, as an excellent writer, understands that she needs to realistically represent the patterns people followed when they introduced new people to one another. It's called storytelling.<br />Certainly, the dialogue Ms. Auel writes may not be the snappy, clever or minimalistic Hemingway-type dialogue that is used in modern pop literature, but that's because she is not writing a Tom Wolfe or a James Patterson novel. She is writing to communicate the human-ness and ordinary-ness of prehistoric humans. That is her aim and her casual, refreshing character dialogue is the tool.<br />Ms. Auel includes some flashbacks and rehashes of past events in her book. People are saying they don't like this. Why? The segues fit into the narrative perfectly, and help to add to the drama and power of the story. In real life, people think back over past events all the time. As a writer, Ms. Auel is once again reflecting reality. I suspect the complainers must be people who usually read minimalistic detective dramas or modern realistic fiction where not much internal work happens.<br />People are griping about the fact that Ayla is \\"larger-than-life\\". Ummmm ... and the point is? Ayla is SUPPOSED to be larger-than-life! Much like a lead character in a graphic or epic novel, she is astounding to both the reader and the characters within the book. She is an archetype. She has always been an archetype. She is not one of those mundane, self-consciously \\"normal\\" characters people in MFA creative writing classes create. Ayla is the product of a REAL writer who knows how to create unusual characters that people literally love. Do you think people would have named their daughters Ayla had Ayla been one of those modern American Janet Evanovich characters? No, of course not.<br />In addition, Ayla is one of those history-changing people that pop into existence now and then. People are whining because Ayla makes all sorts of new discoveries, like how to use rocks to make sparks, where babies come from, how to make a pole drag, etc. Well, people like that DO and HAVE existed. Look at Leonardo da Vinchi and Einstein for examples.<br />I also don't understand why people are objecting to how Ms. Auel makes Ayla very beautiful and grants her a very charismatic personality in the book. Again, extremely beautiful women have existed in the past: ever heard the phrase, \\"The face that launched a thousand ships\\"? Charismatic women have existed as well: Joan of Arc, for one. And sometimes women have existed who were both supernaturally beautiful AND charismatic: consider Cleopatra as an example.<br />Finally, people are saying they are unhappy with Ms. Auel's long descriptions in the book. The long descriptions are there because it is an EPIC tale and an EPIC book. Tolkien did the same thing and no one complains about him. Besides, Ms. Auel wants to impart some knowledge of prehistoric times to the reader and enhance the artistic level of the narrative in doing so. As Ms. Auel has said; \\"The magic is in the details.\\"<br />This book is a worthy accomplishment of a top-notch writer and should be bought, savored, and reread. If you are brave enough to have an open mind, buy this book. If you just follow the pack and base your book purchases on what the masses are saying, well then, you will only be cheating yourself when you miss out on this wonderful, fascinating work by one of the world's greatest living authors.duct of a REAL writer who knows how to create unusual characters that people literally love.

The mystery of what goes on in an autopsy room is explored, and some interesting tidbits of information about hospitals and law enforcment officers are tossed out to the reader.<br />However, the book soon slides into a confused and jumbled collection of segues about the main author's early life, laboriously detailed descriptions of the classes forensic experts take, too-precious inside jokes, half-baked and unsatisfying attempts at summarizing the history of forensic science, and chapters based on themes that sound good (\\"Bugs\\") but are somehow rendered tedious by the syllabus-like writing style and the lack of a connecting narrative.<br />The main author could not resist dragging in a yawn-inducing discussion of the O.J. Simpson evidence scandal. He also spends an inordinate amount of time yapping on and on about a boring Russian murder case from the early part of the twentieth century that, for some reason, commands great interest in his family but is as dull as a butter knife to the reader.<br />When we finally find out what happened to the murder victim who was introduced like bait at the beginning of this strange and awkward book, we don't care. The authors make no real attempt to humanize the victim, who was killed by his lover, and actually make the murder victim an unsympathetic character by detailing the handful of Viagra pills found in his pocket, his HIV-positive status, his unemployment, and by not describing what drew this unfortunate man to a lover who would kill him during a sex act.<br />The authors need to go back to writing school and hope to get Ann Rule for their teacher.<br />If you want to spend your evening courting a dull headache reading about autopsies and forensic science told NPR/Internet message board style, this is the book for you. If you want a really good, fascinating book about forensic science, pick up \\"Dead Men Do Tell Tales\\" ... or just about anything else.>If you want to spend your evening courting a dull headache reading about autopsies and forensic science told NPR/Internet message board style, this is the book for you.

I was looking for a light-hearted, humorous expose of the airline industry, or a bitingly satirical narrative about the bizarre happenings in the life of a flight attendant, David Sedaris-style.<br />What I got was a self-indulgant, whiny, thinly-veiled advertisement for the author's self-written &quot;funny&quot; musical play.<br />A book should not be an advertisement for another product, and that is what this book obviously is. The back cover is adorned with a glamour-shots black-and-white headshot of the author looking somehow 15 years younger than her natural age. The caption of the headshot refers to the author as being &quot;star&quot; of the musical she has written. Come on now, is it really necessary that the cover of the book refer to the author as being a &quot;star&quot;? It was excessive and annoying, as well as untrue.<br />The author goes on and on about how she really planned to be an actress, but her life &quot;just didn't turn out&quot; that way. Oddly, however, the author never took any concrete steps to becoming an actress, such as attending college or, indeed, achieving any higher education at all. The author never addresses her choices, but instead acts wackily bemused at the hand &quot;fate&quot; has dealt her.<br />The most irritating parts of the book are where the author breaks into the lyrics of the musical theater piece she has written. One finds oneself cringing at the too cute, precious lyric writing. There are no laugh-out-loud moments in this book, that's for sure. But there are &quot;Jazz hands, Fosse Fosse Fosse!!!&quot; moments galore.<br />As a librarian, I need to feel confident that I am giving my patrons a book, not an advertisement. Alas, this work is nothing more than a puffed-up resume and theater program released in book form. Save your money and buy a ticket to a local production of &quot;Fame&quot; instead.	2002-05-04

I'm slowly working my way through all of her books and I will be disappointed when I have read everything that she has written.

Your latest collection of short stories is totally devoid of soul and reads like a collection of assignments for an MFA creative writing class at NYU!<br />I've been with you from the start, buddy. I cut my teeth on your work and liked you LOOOONG before it was considered to be \\"cool.\\" I took a lot of flack in college for admiring your work, too. But it looks to me like your writing is now excluding all of your loyal old skool fans and is now embracing people who read the \\"New Yorker\\", have track lighting, and drink fine wines.<br />First of all, I don't know why this book is being billed as a collection of \\"new\\" stories. Several of the stories, including \\"Gotham Cafe\\" and \\"The Deathroom\\" were released in an audiobook form a few years ago called \\"Blood and Smoke\\". Frankly, these stories are the only ones that could be called successful in the collection. \\"The Deathroom\\" is pretty darn good, and \\"Gotham Cafe\\" is a winner. Yet, Mr. King, these stories are years old.<br />The other tales (the REAL \\"new\\" work), including the long-awaited new chapter to the DT series, are just ... well ... just plain BAD.<br />\\"Autopsy\\" is not scary at all, and the last line of the story is completely clumsy and unfunny. The old King would never write such sophomoric drivel.<br />\\"The Man in the Black Suit\\" is like Garrison Keillor on an overdose of Seroquel. The story relies on symbolism so heavy-handed I thought the book was going to slip out of my hands and smash a hole through my floor.<br />I can't address all the stories here, but I have to talk about how crushed I was by the horrible, horrible DT chapter. Gawd! Green zombies and vampire crone women, plus a hot (and completely one-dimensional) young vampire? Come ON! Maybe Mr. King could have pulled it off twenty years ago, but now ... people, it's a cryin' shame. I didn't even LIKE Roland in this story, and usually I want to marry him at the end of every book.<br />I saw here on Amazon that next fall Mr. King is releasing ANOTHER haunted car book. What, did Christine give birth to an SUV? That fact, plus this book, really makes me feel like I am losing a trusted friend. Mr. King ... come back to your old fans. Please?King is releasing ANOTHER haunted car book. What, did Christine give birth to an SUV? That fact, plus this book, really makes me feel like I am losing a trusted friend.

For some reason, even though I like Peter Straub and Stepehn King, I have never been able to get into Dean Koontz. Well, this book is so sharp, original, and compelling that I have not been able to put it down! I am happily surprised to find myself becoming a Dean Koontz fan!<br />The characters of the book aren't your usual dime-novel fare; they are very unusual, funny, and intelligent. Yet they are also believable. The plot has many elements of bizzareness and realism mixed together to create a sharp-edged collage. From the first chapter, where we meet two characters that you can't help but care about right away, to the actual unfolding of the plot, there isn't a dull moment.<br />I'm reminded somewhat of &quot;The Talisman&quot; by some parts of this novel, and that's a good thing.<br />Read it -- you'll like it!!!	2002-01-07

Ms. Rule is back at us with a tight, suspenseful, white-knuckler tale that proves that truth is, indeed, stranger than fiction.<br />Fans who were concerned about Ms. Rule's adequate, yet less exhilirating recent works will find that they are solidly back in Ms. Rule's court once again after they finish this fascinating story.<br />Ms. Rule wrote this book on the request of the victim Sheila Bellush, who told her family to find Ms. Rule and beg her to write the tale of Sheila's life and death should she be murdered by her ex-husband, the abuser Allen Van Houte.<br />Multi-millionaire Allen Van Houte is a classic sociopath; so skilled at wearing his &quot;mask&quot; that everyone who knows him thinks he's the epitome of a &quot;real nice guy.&quot; However, in reality, he is a swindler, con man, domestic violence abuser, sexual molester of children, and finally a murderer. Ms. Rule's clever pen brings his true personality into the light.<br />You feel as if Sheila Bellush is a close and trusted friend after reading this book. In addition, her noble widower Jamie, and the children involved really get into your heart.<br />The emotional, physical, moral, and legal manipulations of Allen Van Houte are amazing to ponder; but those whose lives have been touched by domestic violence will not be surprised and may find reading this story to be cathartic, as Allen Van Houte gets his and then some in the end.<br />A story not to be missed. Highly recommended for both Ann Rule fans and newbies alike.	2002-01-04

This book is of low quality and is not based on any scientific knowledge or research. In the first chapter, the author refers to an alcoholic man &quot;slapping his wife around&quot; but then states that the man did not &quot;seriously&quot; harm his wife. (???). ALL forms of domestic violence are serious. A slap in the wrong place can cause serious damage to the human body. Slapping leads to more damaging forms of abuse 100 percent of the time. Finally, a &quot;mere&quot; slap causes extremely harmful psychological damage to the abused partner.<br />Then the author goes on to state that it was the husband's alcoholism that caused the violence. WRONG!!! Anyone with any knowledge at all of the subject of domestic violence knows that alcoholism does not CAUSE the abuse. Removing the addiction to alcohol cannot, and does not, stop the abuse.<br />Anyone who wants proof of my statements can call their local domestic violence shelter for free information.	2001-11-30

Mr. Baker is one of those persons.<br />I find his paper newspaper &quot;archive&quot; to be a naive venture -- one fire, flood, or angry, ravaging patron and it's gone. It has no viable cataloging method.<br />Finally, Mr. Baker himself seems a bit bizarre in his thinking and quite Old Pale Male School in his philosophy. He did write a previous book, after all, about a man who has the ability to freeze time and to disrobe  unwilling, pretty women in his office. Mr. Baker doesn't even have an MLIS. THIS is the man we librarians (a mostly female profession) are supposed to turn to for leadership?<br />No thanks.	2001-11-20

Well, after &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; I was a little concerned that perhaps my favorite author, Stephen King, may have &quot;lost his touch,&quot; so to speak.<br />I don't know if Mr. King has changed his writing style, or if it is the fact that he wrote this book with Mr. Straub, but this book is GOOD.<br />If you enjoyed &quot;The Talisman&quot;, you will devour this book. If you have not read &quot;The Talisman&quot; yet, please read it BEFORE you read &quot;Black House&quot; or you will be confused.<br />Mr. King's new literary style that includes overblown, confusing narratives is sometimes evident in this book, but it seems that he, or Mr. Straub, have held back the flood of words enough that the clear narrative of this novel is not comprimised in a notable way.<br />The imagery is fresh and exciting, with the descriptions of the feathers and the robin's eggs standing out as truly effective and striking. This book is scary, too; I had chills up and down my spine while reading it.<br />The characters are very believable and I cared about them right away, and the setting is truly creative.<br />&quot;Wolf!

As I read this book, I felt as if I were watching a Lifetime TV special. The writing seems shallow to me. However, if you are an Ann Rule fan you will probably want to read this book, as it is still far better than most true-crime offerings.<br />On a more positive note, I thought &quot;Deadly Seducer&quot; was fabulous and that it lived up to Rule's talent level.

I can't say enough about his talents of communicating entire conecpts through one simple sentence, much like Hemingway.

Schlosser does an excellent job of exposing the hidden side of fast food and indeed the entire franchise mentality. He is not hysterical or sentimental, just factual and unflinching.<br />After reading this book, you will find yourself taken aback by the number of McDonalds and other franchise signs that sprout along our highways. You will actually find yourself SEEING many things about our economy that were not part of your previous everyday thinking reality. You will also realize that the meat-packing industry today consumes poor Mexican and South American workers with the same ferocity that the 19th-century meat-packing industry consumed poor Polish workers.<br />This book is very highly-recommended. The only critique I have is that Schlosser did not offer enough solutions for our franchise economy. The end of the book seemed a little hasty. However, perhaps consciousness-raising will be enough to bring about change.	2001-04-09

The only book he has ever written that I did not like was &quot;Hearts in Atlantis.&quot; I eagerly awaited &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; and grabbed it the moment I saw it. I was extra-excited becaise it is his first book since his terrible accident and I was happy for him that he was writing again.<br />At first, I could not put this book down. Part One was fabulous, with disgusting aliens, fascinating character development, and creative, suspenseful scenarios. But as I began to read Part Two, annoying flaws in the text began to manifest and the narrative began to seem heavy-handed. I became confused by the many Jonesy's and mind-trips. I stopped caring about the characters and felt that each had been given a stock &quot;Oprah show&quot; flaw by King (alcoholism, suicidal ideation, etc.). The hit-by-a-car guy seemed like he was whining too much. The wacky military guy (Kurtz) seemed too much like the wacky military guy in &quot;The Long Walk&quot;. Characters started dying too quickly. There were no major female characters being given spots in the narrative yet (except for a previous chapter with Duddit's Mom)! And what was up with the aliens? Two kinds? I liked the snake-things but the grays were just not fully developed as unique to King's imagination. I know King has a much better imagination than that! Finally, I think the title of the book is cliche. It has the word &quot;dream&quot; in it, an overused word in book titles. Was the dreamcatcher supposed to represent the characters broken dreams? If so, please!!!<br />I don't think I can finish this book. This will be the first King novel I have not finished. I feel bad because I really like Stephen King and I want to be a loyal fan, but this book is not to my liking. I am disappointed. He can do SO MUCH better! I have faith that his next book will be great.	2001-04-09
