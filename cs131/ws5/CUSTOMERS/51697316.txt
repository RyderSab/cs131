All of the sudden people began to starve and the people are just drinking warm and dirty water for breakfast,lunch,and dinner.What will happen to them?Will they starve?Will they get better?I dont know ,that is why you should read this great book.<br />I like this book because it is based on a real world event. I liked it bcause it wasvery interesting to know how people tried to survive in Ireland. There was a rich guy named,Cunningham. He was watching all those people straving and he didn't do a dran thing to help them. There was markets around but nobody bought anything because they didn't have any money to buy anything.<br />I would recommend this book to young adults becasue this is no book for kids, because it is short but kind of complicated so I think that this book would mostly be for young adults,because I think that most of them will get the message easier than kids.I also think they will get sucked by this book right away when they get it and start reading it. So I recommend you read great this great amazing book.	2004-06-09

The author also wanted to make you feel what it is like when somebody doesn't want to give you a chance or doesn't even want to get to know you. Like in Meg's case and also her brother's. They both tried to be friends with the white students but they wouldn't give them a chance just because of their skin.<br />What I liked about the book was that at the end Mayfield Elememntary played against eachother. Finally the white students did accept Meg and ger brother. I also liked the fact that on the front cover, there's a picture of the four kids and they are hugging like real friends. <br />I recommend this book for the kids who still judge people by their appearances. They don't even care about feelings. Maybe after reading this book they will stop being this way.	2004-06-08

Now they are going to stop this and try to make friends with the kids in their new school.<br />What I like about this book is when Meg and Billy were trying to make friends.I also liked how Meg and Billy tried hard to ignore the jokes they made of their color.I also liked when Meg was offering some of her sandwich to a girl who was white. I also think Meg had a lot of courage to offer anything to this white girl.<br />I would recomend this book to Middle school students because this book teaches you a lesson which is to treat people the way you want to be treated because every body is really the same.	2004-06-04

In the Princess Diaries 1 a 14-year-old girl named Mia has to go through alot of changes, one major one is her becoming a princess. This is an interesting, and exciting book that has love, romance and real life stuff happening in it. I personally didn't care for the love and romance parts, but the rest of the book was great. I thought that those parts were boring and dull. They would always seem to go on forever, but then when the story got back to it's fantasy world. The fantasy was somewhat real but somewhat fake. I liked that! It seemed to go into real life and talk about a normal teenagers life, and then gradually go into becoming a princess. <BR>I think this book expands your imagination and fantasy world, while it still keeps you in an everyday life. This book overall is interesting and fun. I think that people who like books about regular teenagers lives and still like fantasy and romance, will love this book. You should go out and read it!!	2002-04-16
