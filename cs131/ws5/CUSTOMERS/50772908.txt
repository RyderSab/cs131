Like John Wayne and Cary Grant, Bogart was larger than life, yet, unlike them, he was also down in the dirt with the rest of us. An average guy in many ways, the characters he played beat the odds, but only after enormous effort and struggle.<br /><br />A.M. Sperber's generally excellent biography shows that Bogart the icon and Bogart the man shared many similar traits. Though the son of a wealthy doctor and his artist wife, there was a dark side to Bogart's outwardly pampered life. His mother was distant, his father was addicted to morphine, and the young boy and his sisters, one of whom suffered from mental illness, were abused by the servants. Bogart was an academic failure with little hope for success until distinguishing himself on Broadway with his classic portrayal of Duke Mantee in \\"The Petrified Forest.\\"<br /><br />But even when Hollywood beckoned, life didn't get easier for the insecure actor. While James Cagney, George Raft, Paul Muni, and Edward G. Robinson were \\"stars\\" who got the best roles Warner Bros. had to offer, Bogart was taken for granted, a mere contract player who played supporting roles in the important projects, and spent years buried in a series of undistinguished B flicks churned out on the Hollywood assembly line. Well paid, especially by Depression era standards, he nonetheless struggled to support his ailing sisters and to pay off his late father's debts.<br /><br />Today, it's hard to believe his employers took so long to recognize the charisma and talent that Bogart would bring to \\"High Sierra\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon,\\" both of which were intended for that great non-entity George Raft. \\"Casablanca,\\" of course, made Bogart the biggest star on the Warner lot, and Sperber shoots down the myth that both Raft and Ronald Reagan were initially considered for the role of Hollywood's ultimate romantic hero. For once, a role was tailor-made for Bogart, and the legend was born.<br /><br />Bogart's early life isn't covered as thoroughly as hoped, but that's not a surprise since most of those who could provide insight into the future superstar had died long before Sperber began her book. But the career is well documented, and the man behind the myth emerges as a flesh and blood figure, a fiercely intelligent and generally admirable one, on every page.<br /><br />Brian W.

By the time you've reached the last page, you'll likely feel that Ronson agrees with you wherever you stand. This \\"objectivity\\" is part of the book's brilliance.<br /><br />Ronson writes with a real wit that is sure to entertain both those who side with the conspiracy theorists he rubs shoulders with, and those who regard such folks with the deepest suspicion. Ronson's too close for comfort encounter with the Bilderberg group is hilarious, and the final chapter, in which he infiltrates a gathering of owl worshiping elitists at Bohemian Grove, poses more questions than it answers. Even those who believe the world is not being manipulated by powerful forces behind the scenes are bound to raise an eyebrow or two, and wonder, \\"What the hell is going on here?\\"<br /><br />THEM is a fine, funny book for those on both sides of the fence, and for anyone looking for some good laughs but with more substance than you'll find in a title by Dave Barry.<br /><br />Brian W.

That may be an impossible task, but certainly it would be practical to collect the interviews he gave to major publications in one thick volume.<br /><br />\\"Younger Than That Now\\" doesn't do that. Notably absent are the interviews I was hoping to find, particularly Dylan's hilariously elusive conversation with Jann Wenner in a 1969 issue of Rolling Stone in which Wenner tries and fails to get Dylan to acknowledge that he's a \\"youth leader\\" and a spokesman for someone other than himself. Then there's the 1978 interview with Jonathan Cott, also in Rolling Stone, that, in hindsight, hinted at his conversion to Christianity while also demonstrating his sense of humor.<br /><br />So, \\"Younger Than That Now\\" isn't definitive. As long as you know that before you dive in, it's a worthwhile read collecting many memorable exchanges Dylan had with the press through the years.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks	2005-08-31

As another reader notes, there are errors including some he didn't mention that I'll add here: The original September 1974 New York recording of \\"If You See Her, Say Hello,\\" re-recorded in Minneapolis for its release on \\"Blood On The Tracks,\\" was not included on \\"Biograph\\" (Trager may be confusing it with \\"You're A Big Girl Now\\"), but on \\"The Bootleg Series, Volume 1-3.\\" Trager also claims Dylan's 1984 \\"Real Live\\" failed to make the charts. Not so. It failed to make the top 100, but it did have a brief, albeit dim, blaze of glory in the Billboard Top 200. There are other errors, most of them fairly minor, but their cumulative effect makes one question Trager's reliability too often.<br /><br />Despite the faults, this is still an entertaining and informative read with lots of background on the recordings and, more significantly, the songs, including those that Dylan only performed in concert. Yes, it is reasonable to argue that it wasn't necessary to provide two pages on the careers of Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini simply because Dylan covered their legendary \\"Moon River\\" at a handful of concerts (and if other sources are correct, Dylan only performed it once upon hearing of the death of Stevie Ray Vaughan). But I find these facts to be the main appeal of Trager's book. There are similar biographical details provided for everyone from Mel Tillis (whose \\"Detroit City\\" is another hit and run cover from the Never Ending Tour) and Charles Gates Dawes, vice president to Calvin Coolidge and co-author of \\"It's All In The Game,\\" another chestnut Dylan dug out two decades ago in concert. And, of course, there are pages on less surprising figures, including Woody Guthrie, Blind Willie McTell, Johnny Cash, and Leonard Cohen. The result is that this book is almost a mini-history of popular music as much as it is about Dylan, but I find it contributes to a greater appreciation for Dylan's impressive range of musical styles and influences. On the other hand, a ridiculous amount of space is given to a biography of Catfish Hunter, the baseball player who was the subject of the most inconsequential outtake from the 1976 \\"Desire\\" album.<br /><br />Trager's unpretentious style is refreshing, though, especially in contrast to those who write about Dylan and his songs as though the man was already dead and buried instead of alive, kicking, and as brilliant as ever.<br /><br />Hopefully, Trager or someone at the publisher's office will pay attention to the complaints provided by the readers, and eliminate the errors in future editions. With a little work, Trager's book may one day live up to its title. It's still worthwhile overall, but Clinton Heylin would have gotten more of the facts straight.<br /><br />Brian W.

Buchanan struck terror in the hearts of those on the left, but even the political right for which he was a prominent spokesman have looked askance on his activities ever since his ill-fated run for the White House against George H.W. Bush in 1992. Several years later, he further alienated his party and earned the admiration of true independents by joining forces with Ralph Nader to warn the nation of the danger that NAFTA represented for America's workers.<br /><br />Buchanan is now, in a sense, a man without a party as he sees both Democrats and Republicans sacrificing American sovereignty as they join the movement toward globalization.<br /><br />In \\"A Republic, Not An Empire,\\" Buchanan sounds like a man who could comfortably share a drink with Gore Vidal, technically a leftist, but officially another small \\"r\\" republican who sees the U.S.A. in danger of becoming an empire, fighting wars and invading countries for the benefit of a \\"New World Order\\" rather than the preservation of our own self-interests. Buchanan doesn't merely sound off, but provides detailed history lessons that demonstrate the unwieldy and dangerous path America is following, and continues to follow no matter what party is leading the nation.<br /><br />This is neither a \\"liberal\\" nor a \\"conservative\\" book.

His examination of the 9/11 terrorist attacks on America, and the way our leaders (deliberately?) failed to take action to prevent them is frighteningly credible, and is backed up with research from sources never consulted by the mainstream media.<br /><br />This collection of essays, some new, some old, may have inspired Michael Moore's film \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" but while Moore is content with mere Bush-bashing that sometimes plays into the hands of the equally corrupt opposition, Vidal surveys the full landscape of our government's questionable activities and pulls no punches when doing so.<br /><br />Some of what Vidal writes is pure speculation, but the questions he raises need to be considered by every American, liberal and conservative alike. The New York Times promises to deliver \\"all the news that's fit to print.\\" Vidal gives us the rest, the news that the Times and the other masters of miscommunication have neither the guts nor the integrity to report.<br /><br />Brian W.

Tough and funny with an iconoclasm even Bogie would have been hard-pressed to match, the author acknowledges his tough guy aspirations in the foreword to this collection of his early work: \\"I thought of myself as a tough guy. That is to say I pretended to be a tough guy.\\" The cover photograph showing Tosches with cigarette in hand, a wiseguy look in his eyes, suggest he's still pretending. It may be an act but Tosches has the write stuff to pull it off.<br /><br />That foreword may be one of the most honest self-portraits a writer has ever published. He admits what most of us who toil in the land of ink-stained wretchdom would probably deny but know to be true: we write because we're afraid to look someone in the eye and tell the honest, unvarnished truth about ourselves and others. But even confronting a blank piece of paper requires a courage many writers and aspiring writers lack. Tosches has  courage in abundance. Anyone who subscribes to the foolishness of political correctness won't be able to endure more than a few pages of Tosches's writing. He's brutal in his honesty, and refuses to bow down and kiss the ring of popular fashion. Whether the subject is his own youth, Elvis (his ruminations on the King are a highlight), Miles Davis, fellow writer Lester Bangs, drugs, sex, rock and roll, or country music, Tosches, whose formal education never progressed beyond high-school, writes about it in an often erudite manner that is saved from pretension by the tough kick to the groin he frequently administers.<br /><br />This collection was compiled from Tosches' writings through the years for publications large and small, and usually obscure and forgotten. His prose (and the several pages of poetry included) is shocking, funny, and damn good. This a collection to turn to again and again.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks	2004-08-26

But we watch, not only to bask in the reflected glory of the annointed ones, but also for the rare opportunity to see them disappointed, as four out of five nominees are, year after year.<br />Now, in this age of media saturation, we know the Oscars are more than a one night affair. The Academy Awards are a contest as competitive, and sometimes just as dirty, as the race for the White House. Mason Wiley and Damien Bona's \\"Inside Oscar\\" is the \\"Gone With the Wind\\" of Oscar books, the only one that fully details the tasteless and sometimes cutthroat tactics that have been employed to impress Oscar, Hollywood's most enduring superstar.<br />This mammoth volume covers the show-biz ritual from the very beginning at a small ceremony that attracted little notice (\\"Wings\\" was named best picture) through the era when Oscar emerged as a superstar of the small screen in the 50s, right through to the crowning of \\"Forrest Gump\\" as best picture of 1994.<br />There's the inside dope on such controversies as George C. Scott's refusal to accept his Oscar for \\"Patton\\" (shamelessly calling the ritual a \\"meat parade\\"), and Sacheen Littlefeather's speech on behalf of Marlon Brando who turned down his Oscar for \\"The Godfather.\\" Wiley and Bona are lively writers who never pass up an opportunity for an amusingly scathing observation. Their behind-the-scenes exploration of what really goes on in the battle for Oscar glory is more entertaining than many of the films honored.<br />For Oscar junkies, this book provides the most thorough coverage available.

That's where Damien Bona and the late Mason Wiley's \\"Inside Oscar\\" came in. In grand Hollywood tradition, Bona has written a sequel that continues the saga of the movie world's most enduring superstar, a bald-headed, gold-plated guy who, like Elvis, is so famous he doesn't need a last name.<br />Oscar is in the mold of a lot of Hollywood heroes. Like Clint Eastwood, he doesn't say much and rarely cracks a smile. Yet everyone wants to take this stern looking character home. But how do you attract his attention?<br />Like its predecessor, \\"Inside Oscar 2\\" details the cutthroat and merciless tactics that have been employed to win the golden guy's approval. The shameless campaigning, the backstabbing, and the money, money, and more money that goes into getting what amounts to a mere pat on the back from one's peers is all deftly exposed in so much detail that it makes all other Oscar books obsolete.<br />This edition covers the eventful years of 1995-2000 when Oscar made some choices he may never live down (Begnini as best actor over Nick Nolte and Ian McKellan; \\"Shakespeare in Love\\" as best picture over \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"), and seemed to be influenced more than ever by tasteless campaigning (the Harvey Weinstein-Miramax influence on the awards are in full blossom by this time).<br />Bona writes with a cynical and decidely liberal bent, devoting a lot of space to the controvery surrounding a lifetime achievement award for super fink Elia Kazan (whom he obviously despises). So, he's a little biased (okay, VERY biased), but for Oscar junkies, this book and its predecessor offer the best, most thorough coverage available, following each notable nominee and potential contender for the big prize through the entire awards season: from the National Board of Review's ranking of the year's best, to the various critic's awards and the Golden Globes, right through to Oscar night and its aftermath.

Rather than classify films according to genre as some of his competitors do (Where would you look for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;? In Drama? Sci-fi?), the titles are arranged alphabetically making the search for a particular film fairly easy. The information provided (year of release, running time, cast, director, availability on DVD and video) is all relevant and useful.<br />Certainly, this book has its faults. The ratings are sometimes  inconsistent, with some films mysteriously rising to three stars from one-and-a-half in a previous volume, and Maltin (or his co-writers) have their own tastes which may or may not reflect yours, mine, or the majority of his readers. Still, the capsule reviews are often witty, and whether or not you agree with the ratings, there is just enough pertinent information about thousands (and thousands and thousands) of movies to make it the most useful of these reference guides.<br />My only complaint is that though each year's edition is larger than the last, a lot of older films are tossed out to make room for the new. Some of the extras added in the last decade (the list of actor and director credits at the end of the book) should be eliminated instead. A complete list of films by a particular star or director can be found in other sources, and is not essential here.<br />Still, as a handy, easy to consult reference, Maltin's Movie and Video Guide serves its purpose very well.	2004-02-12

I have no problem with that. It doesn't surprise me that the man has used people as stepladders throughout his life, befriending them when it benefits his ambitions and discarding them once they no longer serve his selfish ends. And the man treats people so shabbily that as he knocked on heaven's door with a near fatal heart ailment in 1997, only one of his band-members bothered to contact him and wish him well.<br />What we don't get is the exhaustive, knowledgable background on his music that Clinton Heylin provides in &quot;Behind the Shades: Revisited&quot; which hit bookstores at the same time. That volume bursts with background info on the recordings and still found time to dish up heaping piles of dirt. Sounes offers some surprising news about a post-Sara marriage that Dylan remarkably managed to conceal, and the revelation (true?) that at the lowest point in his career, he asked to join the Grateful Dead (and was turned down)!<br />For Dylan fans, at least those who don't object to learning that their hero's music may be the only truly admirable thing about him, Sounes book is a worthwhile read, but it's more of a back road than a highway.	2004-02-11

Vidal, perhaps out of rivalry, perhaps out of genuine contempt resulting from objective analysis, makes a meal out of author John Updike in \\"Rabbit's Own Burrow,\\" the lengthy essay that may be the highlight of this collection. When Vidal brings out his carving knives, you may sometimes pity whomever he deigns to dine on, but you're likely to be satisfied with the feast he serves.<br />Vidal can be nice, too, and his thoughts on Frank Sinatra shortly after the crooner's death, are enlightening for anyone who squirmed at the sight of the Voice's seemingly illogical embrace of conservative politics after a lifetime of populism.  Elsewhere, in his reaction to the death of Richard Nixon, you're not entirely sure where he stands. Vidal seems to have a grudging respect for the man he did so much to villify.<br />Vidal's massive ego takes to the stage in \\"A Note on The City and the Pillar and Thomas Mann\\" in which he shares with us entries from Mann's diary praising...Vidal! It could almost be too much to take if Vidal weren't so amusing even at his most insufferable.<br />Vidal is the last of the great curmudgeons, but unlike most of that breed, he resists being fully lovable.

It's certainly no surprise that the people of La La Land are two-faced, double-talking parasites as shallow as 99% of the movies and TV shows they produce. Eszterhas merely pulls the ragged curtains from the window. The glass was shattered long ago.<br />What makes &quot;Hollywood Animal&quot; worth a quick skim is Eszterhas' expose of the nightmare factory and the living dead who are its inhabitants. There's Sylvester Stallone hijacking the credit for &quot;F.I.S.T,&quot; Eszterhas' first screenplay, then publicly apologizing and giving Eszterhas full credit AFTER the movie tanks. There's the wicked Sharon Stone, the thorougly ridiculous Robert Evans, and other freaks and losers whose &quot;art&quot; reduces our eyes, ears, and minds to garbage dumps.<br /><br />On a brighter note, there's also Norman Jewison, the talented director (&quot;In the Heat of the Night,&quot; &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;) who is one of the few people Eszterhas encounters to come off favorably, a model of integrity, in fact.<br /><br />Of course, Eszterhas is as shallow as the biggest sleazebags he encounters. His most illustrious credits, after all, are &quot;Basic Instict&quot; and &quot;Flashdance,&quot; pure garbage doomed to be forgotten when other garbage takes their place in the vast wasteland of popular culture. Yet throughout &quot;Hollywood Animal&quot; he maintains the superior pose of a &quot;writer,&quot; and worst of all, a writer in the Hemingway mold with all that silly macho posturing that has nothing to do with writing and everything to do with insecurity and, perhaps, a lack of talent. Frankly, Joe, writing is more feminine than masculine. There's nothing remotely macho about sitting behind a typewriter making up stories, even ones about lesbians who kill men with icepicks. Yuck.<br /><br />Eszterhas belongs with the con artists and phonies he writes about. He relates an experience in which a married nurse telephones her husband to profess her love at the same time she cuckolds him with Eszterhas, but he writes as if the woman is somehow more corrupt than he. Not so, Joe. It simply illustrates that people of low character attract each other the way manure attracts flies.

US	50772908	RTX8FU8EJP03R	0688174418	123493690	A Charge to Keep	Books	2	41	66	N	N	Simple	Like many another left-leaning moderate (or right-leaning liberal, or whatever the hell I would call myself these days), George W. Bush wasn't my choice for president, but with smarmy Al Gore his only serious opponent, his victory (if that's what you'd call it) didn't distress me too much. After all, if the lesser of two evils (Gore) is still evil, the greater of two evils (ahem) is almost comforting. If Forrest Gump's famous observation is correct (&quot;Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get&quot;), one could argue that the greater of two evils is preferable. You know exactly what you're gonna get, and if you get something you didn't expect, chances are you'll be pleasantly surprised rather than bitterly disappointed at having been betrayed.<br />It's a tradition of sorts to give any newly elected leader the benefit of the doubt, and in that spirit, I read Georgie boy's book (albeit three years into his presidency). Why not? After all, it's a quick read.<br />Of course, it's a &quot;quick read&quot; because, like all &quot;books&quot; supposedly written by presidential candidates prior to seeking the presidency, it's really not a book at all. It's campaign material, propaganda meant to paint the candidate in the flattering colors of his own choosing, and it's no surprise that Bush's tract does not challenge the established formula of this peculiar genre. It's also no surprise that Bush probably didn't write his book. He doesn't strike me as much of a reader, much less a writer, and one can take it for granted that he spent most of the four years preceding his &quot;election&quot; working on his 2000 campaign, not writing drafts of any memoir.<br />This is the work of Karen Hughes, the credited co-author, and, in one sense, she does a brilliant job. Even though it's unlikely Bush spent even one moment behind a word processor or typewriter, Hughes nontheless captures his spirit in her prose, creating a book very much like the one Bush would write if he were to bother with such things. The sentences are all short and to the point, never complex enough to require a comma, all reinforcing the image of Bush as a very simple man. Simplicity has its virtues, but one can argue whether it's the best virtue for a man whose job requires day-to-day decisions regarding enormously complex life or death matters, but, like Reagan, his simplicity is part of whatever charm he has.<br />The prose never reveals much, certainly nothing that would indicate Bush was anything other than what he claims to be (which is?), and is as instantly forgettable as similar books by Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and other seekers of the highest office in the land. This is political propaganda and nothing more, but who would think it was anything but?Bush would write if he were to bother with such things.

US	50772908	RK9BWI5CXOJ9C	0375756450	642527170	Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan	Books	2	4	6	N	N	An imagined biography	It's not my habit to review a book I haven't finished reading, but if the book is so bad that it's impossible to finish, it's fair game. &quot;Dutch,&quot; Edmund Morris' so-called memoir of Ronald Reagan is a case in point. The cover photograph of the 40th president waving to God knows who while his back is turned is an appropriate image symbolizing what Morris has done. Despite unprecedented access to a sitting president, Morris turned his back on his subject and instead chose to concoct a ridiculous mish-mash of fact and fiction that only left me frustrated and confused. Morris claims he chose this approach because Reagan is just so damned weird and boring that a traditional biography would be impossible. That's nothing but a cop-out. Whatever Reagan's eccentricities, Morris' job was to see beyond them and find the man's soul. If he hasn't got one, Morris could have simply reported his findings. Instead he concocts a bizarre fiction in which the author becomes a character in Reagan's life, often sharing his adventures with a fictional son named Gavin, a 60s activist who is a laughable stereotype of every prominent radical from the period. And Morris documents his communication with the mythical son as if he actually exists. Never before has a book's notes and references been so unnecessary.<br />All of this nonsense would have been tolerable if Morris admitted that the result is a novel, not a biography. As a fiction, it is well-written and Morris' insights are not without value, but this is neither memoir nor biography. Whether you love Reagan or loathe him, Morris' book is not the one to consult when seeking an objective look at the gipper.	2003-12-11
US	50772908	R3FVUX9KLGLSHL	0743455967	44310359	On Writing	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A good read, but more autobiography than writer's guide	&quot;On Writing&quot; is only the second Stephen King book I've read. The first, &quot;Danse Macabre,&quot; was also non-fiction. I'm no literary snob, but there are a lot of books out there to read and only so many hours in the day, and I've chosen not to read fiction about people who blow things up with their eyeballs or possess other powers not likely to be encountered in real life. I'm sure King's phenomenally popular output has more going for it than that, but it has limited appeal for me. Still, I'm always curious to know what other ink-stained wretches have to say about the craft, so I had to read &quot;On Writing.&quot;<br />You'd have to be very curious indeed about King's methods to wade through his &quot;memoir of the craft.&quot; Early on, he describes &quot;On Writing&quot; as a way to record all he knows about writing &quot;briefly and simply.&quot; He does keep it simple, avoiding the pretentious language one often encounters from &quot;writers&quot; who want to impress readers with their vocabulary. Brief is another matter. He quotes William Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White's &quot;The Elements of Style,&quot; claiming he'll follow their advice to &quot;Omit needless words,&quot; but he makes that promise in the &quot;Second Foreword&quot; where he also suggests this is a &quot;short book.&quot;<br />A short book? With a &quot;Second Foreword&quot;? Those looking for guidelines to more effective writing are better off with Strunk and White whose short volume has never been improved on. With King, one is dragged along as he recounts his beginnings, relationship with his mother, and, later, the accident that nearly took his life. It's certainly interesting, but try finding the advice for writers in there. He does offer valuable suggestions, but if all you're seeking is tips to improve your own writing, you can find better guides than this one. If you're interested in King's life story, however, dig in. On that level, it's a good read.	2003-12-01

Of course, McGilligan could argue that it isn't his book that's offensive, but the life of its subject. I think it's a little of both.<br />If McGilligan is correct, Eastwood's public image is a sham. Widely praised for his loyalty, the Eastwood in McGilligan's book banishes lifelong friends from his circle should they dare ask for even a tiny crumb of the pie they helped bake. Producers, directors, editors, writers, all of them working for comparative peanuts, become &quot;non-persons&quot; in the eyes of Clint the squint, and they are exiled from his Malpaso production company and from the film industry itself because, they insist, the big man is vindictive, and uses his considerable influence to deprive them of their right to make a living. But the macho icon is also a coward who loathes confrontation and never fires anyone directly, letting others do his dirty work for him. Rich beyond mere tabulation, Dirty Harry's Republican alter ego slams welfare and brags that he worked for &quot;every crust of bread&quot; he ever ate, yet never pays for a meal, insisting on being &quot;comped&quot; wherever he goes. And as a filmmaker, his legendary habit of delivering films ahead of schedule and under budget is nothing but carelessness and a wiliness to accept subpar work to keep his budgets low and his percentages high.<br />He's also a womanizer whose relationships produced numerous illegitimate children, an opportunist who used his brief reign as Mayor of Carmel for his own financial gain, and a father in name only.<br />Then there's that temper. Anyone who dares park in his unmarked space on the Warner lot will know holy terror as Eastwood vandalizes their vehicle with a golf club, hammer, or a pickup truck. Good luck if you sue him in court, especially with a judge who asks for his autograph.<br />As someone who always thought highly of Eastwood personally no matter what I thought of his films (most of which I admire), I found this account of his life rather disturbing, but the book is disturbing in ways that have more to do with McGilligan than Eastwood. The punctuation is often a mess with periods appearing outside quotation marks, and the spelling is often questionable, with the author spelling tires as &quot;tyres&quot; when describing the ludicrous climax of The Gauntlet. Maybe the guy is English and doesn't always Americanize his language but the biographical notes describe him as living in Missouri, so that may not be an excuse.<br />There are also more substantial errors. McGilligan has Ronald Reagan appropriating Dirty Harry's famous &quot;Make my day&quot; speech from Sudden Impact in March 1983, nine months before the film is released. And he gets other dates wrong: In his world, Paint Your Wagon opened a year later than it did, and Escape from Alcatraz debuts in the Christmas season of 1979 when, in fact, it opened the previous June. One can excuse errors here and there, but release dates can be easily verified, and McGilligan makes them consistently. If he can't get a film's release date right, how much faith can we have in his account of incidents from Eastwood's life, incidents at which the author was not present?<br />If nothing else, this book's sloppy research suggests McGilligan suffers from one of the same personality flaws for which he frequently reprimands his subject. Eastwood, he says, is always happy with the first draft of the screenplays he stars in and/or directs, never requesting and always resisting rewrites (perhaps because they require shelling out cash, something the miserly multi-millionaire is loathe to do). McGilligan's book reads like a first draft that never made it to the proofreader. Perhaps a quote from the Bibleis in order here: &quot;Judge not lest ye be judged.&quot;<br />McGilligan's book is certainly an improvement over Richard Shickel's earlier look at the Hollywood titan.

I never questioned his talent, but he plied his trade most successfully in \\"Shogun\\" and \\"The Thornbirds,\\" TV mini-series that didn't interest me, and in lame-brained big-screen blockbusters like \\"The Towering Inferno\\" which interested me less. Therefore, I was suprised at how much I enjoyed his well-written memoir, \\"Shattered Love.\\" The dramatic title does not refer, as I initially thought, to a romantic relationship gone wrong, but to Chamberlain's belief that we are all splinters - pieces, rather than products - of a loving God. I'm not sure I accept that theory but Chamberlain is obviously sincere in his philisophical and spiritual beliefs, and they have no doubt helped heal his damaged soul.<br />Part of that damage resulted from his long repressed homosexuality, but though Chamberlain's \\"coming out\\" was used to promote the book, it is but one piece of the whole, just as he regards his sexual orientation as just a piece, and a mundane one at that, of his entire being. This is not a lurid confessional but a heartfelt account of Chamberlain's search for truth and self-acceptance based on the quality and content of his soul rather than the size of his fame and popularity.<br />Of course, Chamberlain takes time to reflect on his acting career, but avoids back-biting and gossip, finding only kind words for co-stars like Raquel Welch whom he and the other cast members of 1974's \\"The Three Musketeers\\" were predisposed to dislike but found adorable, and Barbara Stanwyck, whose professionalism impressed him when they co-starred in \\"The Thornbirds.\\" But when he turns his attention to show-biz, Chamberlain mainly focuses on how he learned his craft, and how his inhibitions and insecurity were hurdles he had to jump before he could excel at his art.<br />\\"Shattered Love\\" is an inspiring and worthwhile read, even if, like me, you were never really a fan of the actor who wrote it. By the final chapter, you may be one.	2003-11-05

Unfortunately, the void, though smaller, still exists since this is far from an objective look at either Eastwood the man, the star, or the filmmaker. It's certainly not a surprise. Schickel wrote a 1992 TV special promoting &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; and also compiled the film clips for the tribute preceding Eastwood's reciept of the Irving Thalberg Award at the 1995 Oscars. Eastwood cooperated with the author for this biography and even did some interviews in tandem with Schickel to promote the book. And when informing us that the critic for Life magazine praised 1968's &quot;Hang 'Em High,&quot; Schickel neglects to point out the name of that critic who just so happened to be...duh, Richard Schickel. When biographer and subject are such good buddies, well, you just have to wonder if you're getting anything closely resembling the truth. But...<br />As an overview of Eastwood's career, particularly his transformation from a superstar in genre movies to respected  auteur, it is sufficient, even though some easily detected errors go undetected (&quot;Unforgiven&quot; recieved 9 Oscar nominations, not 8 as Schickel says - doesn't anybody bother to check these things?).	2003-10-23

Whether it's an economic collapse or a war, David and his co-horts on the Council on Foreign Relations and the Trilateral Commission are allegedly behind it.  Since little else has been written about the man, \\"Memoirs\\" fills a void.  Unfortunately, it doesn't fill that void as well as I would have hoped.<br /><br />For bankers or those intrigued by banking, Rockefeller's lengthy desciption of his career at Chase may make for fascinating reading.  The rest of us may be tempted to stop reading at this point and start skimming.  On the other hand, the description of David's life within the Rockefeller family is interesting.  As the youngest member of the famous (or infamous) dynasty, David was shunned by his older siblings and lived a rather solitary, though, it seems, generally happy life.  Rockefeller writes about this, as well as his later experiences in college (where he once again had a hard time fitting in), with a modesty that really won me over.  He also offers nice portraits of the rest of the clan, including his father who, despite his wealth, fought a battle against paralyzing shyness and depression.  Rockefeller succeeds in defining his family by something other than its wealth.<br /><br />But David Rockefeller's wiliness to hobnob with dictators as easily as he does presidents and popes is not going to quiet the conspiracy theorists. His activities do suggest that this man who admits to a lifelong fascination with entemology (the study of insects) does not make a distinction between bugs and the majority of the human race.  Since Rockefeller doesn't appear to feel he needs to explain his motivations, and doesn't exactly deny that he is working to push the U.S., and other nations, into a one-world government, one can only assume that the allegations are true.<br /><br />When he keeps the focus on his famous family, Rockefeller writes with an openness that would have been beneficial to other parts of the book.

What makes Heylin so good at documenting the ups and downs of Dylan the man and the artist is that Heylin is a fan--a diehard, intelligent and knowledgeable fan, who treats Dylan seriously as an artist.  What makes Heylin even better is he never fawns over his subject. He may very well be Dylan's harshest critic, one who doesn't hesitate to label some highly regarded Dylan performances as junk or to suggest that Dylan found more inspiration in the bottle during the 1980s than he did in his work.  The fact that Heylin deals with that often neglected decade in Dylan's career at all makes this a treat.  Whereas most biographers give us exhaustive accounts of Dylan in the 1960s and skip over the 80s, Heylin follows the music through the highs (Shot of Love) and lows (Knocked Out Loaded) of that period.	2002-10-01

The phrase 'generation gap' took its place in the language at that time, but some performers bridged it by appealing to a variety of age groups (Elvis and, I suppose, the Beatles).  One of those performers was Dean Martin.  I was too young to have more than a passing interest in the mop-tops from Liverpool, but was a fan of Elvis through his movies as much as his music.  Yet, I always liked Dean Martin, and I wasn't the only one of my generation to tune in, every Thursday night at 10 p.m., to his NBC-TV show.  'Did you watch Dean Martin last night?' That question could often be heard at school the next day from kids whose closets were too crowded with blue jeans and T-shirts to accommodate a tuxedo.  At the time, I snickered at Frank Sinatra whose scooby-doobie-dos made him seem only marginally more hip than Lawrence Welk.  But Dean Martin was the genuine article.<br />Nick Tosches's book about the man is the genuine article in its way, too: a big, exhaustively researched, and strongly written look at the culture that made Dean Martin the man that he was.  But who was Dino?  Tosches claims no one had the answer, and he quotes the second Mrs. Martin as saying 'He's either the most complex man imaginable or the simplest.  There's either nothing under there or too much.'  Tosches doesn't really seem to have a handle on the man either, except to suggest he was indifferent to everything.  'He simply no longer cared,' Tosches tells us at several points, adding that he never really did.  Yet, many of the people he interviews portray a man who did care, but tried hard not to show it.  Director Andrew V. McLaglen called him 'the most conscientious actor I've ever worked with.'  But if Tosches fails to fully capture Martin's life (often choosing to imagine it instead), he does capture his times.  Whether it's the Hollywood of the early 50's when Martin and Lewis ruled show business, or the Rat Pack era when Hollywood, Washington, and the mob formed an uneasy alliance, Tosches brings it alive in sharp, stunning prose.  'Dino: Living High in the Dirty Business of Dreams' is a strange, even bizarre, book: a big 'literary' biography of a man whose own reading tastes allegedly ran to comic books, but it gives Dean Martin the due that others denied him.  Because he didn't take himself seriously, it's often assumed that no one else should either.

Until this book, I was unfamiliar with his work.  Now I see what I was missing.<br /><br />Not only was Tynan a highly skilled writer of prose, but as a critic he saw things for what they were, even if the majority disagreed.  He gives Warren Beatty's pretentious and mystifyingly overrated film Shampoo the swift kick to the rear that it deserves, and even finds a fault with Paddy Cheyefsky's Network that I had not detected prior to reading his assessment of the film in his diaries. Tynan also has his say on economics (\\"Inflation rides high and I believe intentionally\\" he writes in 1973) and a myriad of other subjects including his preoccupation with spanking.<br /><br />Overall, these diaries reveal a melancholy soul who found some solace in writing about his life and its disappointments in his journal.  Most published diaries promise more than they deliver.  Not Tynan's.  His diaries are a compelling read.	2002-06-19

Rather than classify films according to genre as  some of his competitors do (Where would you look for &quot;Dr.  Strangelove&quot;?  In Drama? Sci-fi?), the titles are arranged  alphabetically making the search for a particular film fairly easy.  The  information provided (year of release, running time, cast, director,  availability on DVD and video) is all relevant and useful.<br />Certainly,  this book has its faults.  The ratings are often inconsistent, a result, no  doubt, of its having been written by more than one person, and some classic  films (&quot;Taxi Driver,&quot; &quot;Unforgiven&quot;) are dismissed with  shockingly low ratings.  Still, the capsule reviews are often witty, and  whether or not you agree with the ratings, there is just enough pertinent  information about thousands (and thousands and thousands) of movies to make  it the most useful of these reference guides.  My major complaint would be  that, though each year's edition is larger than the last, a lot of older  films are tossed out to make room for the new.  I'd prefer that some of the  extras added in the last decade (the list of actor and director credits at  the end of the book) be eliminated instead.  A complete list of films by a  particular star or director can be found in other sources, and is not  really essential here.	1999-12-17

Sure, novelist Graham Greene's July 5, 1935 critique  of James Whale's brilliant \\"Bride of Frankenstein,\\" published in the  Spectator, is full of it.  \\"This is a pompous, badly acted film, full of  absurd anachronisms and inconsistencies,\\" the pompous writer wrote.  But  Greene is entitled to his pompous opinion and anachronistic taste.  It  doesn't make him wrong.  It makes him a man with an opinion that the  majority of film buffs disagree with.  The authors then contradict their  purpose by quoting Manny Farber's April 1, 1950 review of \\"The Third Man,\\"  which rips apart Graham Greene's screenplay and calls the author an  \\"uncinematic snob.\\"  But the Graham Greene whose screenplay of \\"The Third  Man\\" the authors feel a need to defend is the same Graham Greene whose  critique of \\"Bride of Frankenstein\\" so offended them.<br />The folks who put  this book together ARE wrong so often that they should have been  embarrassed to see it published.  The captions to the photos are chock full  of errors that could have easily been corrected.  Under a still of Sydney  Greenstreet and Humphrey Bogart in \\"Casablanca,\\" someone wrote, \\"The  Maltese Falcon was to come later.\\"  Later?  \\"Casablanca\\" was released to  theaters in New York in November 1942 (the rest of the country wouldn't see  the film until January 1943), a full year after \\"The Maltese Falcon.\\"  Such  a mistake is inexcusable in a book purporting to spotlight \\"Misguided Movie  Reviews and Film Criticism Gone Wrong.\\"  Before pointing out the supposed  errors in someone else's opinions, the authors should have corrected their  facts.<br />The most offensive chapter of the book concerns huge box-office  hits like \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Star Wars,\\" and suggests that because a film makes a  lot of money, it automatically has merit.  And the errors of simple fact  are not limited to the order in which those Bogart classics were released.  \\"The Fugitive,\\" this book claims, won the Golden Globe and the Director's  Guild of America award for best director!  Not so.  Steven Spielberg won  both awards for directing \\"Schindler's List.\\"<br />How did this turkey ever  reach print?<br />The most offensive chapter of the book concerns huge box-office  hits like \\"Jaws\\" and \\"Star Wars,\\" and suggests that because a film makes a  lot of money, it automatically has merit.

Edward Robb Ellis' \\"A Diary of the Century,\\" a 578 page book collecting selections from diaries spanning 68 years, opens with a typically stylish introduction by Pete Hamill and closes with an index, the latter being the  first place I looked after acquiring this mammoth volume.  Searching for  familiar names, I found Elvis Presley to whom Ellis refers on page 539 in  an entry dated January 8, 1993, what would have been the King of Rock and  Roll's 58th birthday:  \\"Elvis Presley stamps went on sale today, much to my  disgust.  Years ago, when he was being discharged from the army, I was one  of many reporters interviewing him.  I remember asking him how he could  justify his enormous wealth when school teachers were being underpaid.  He  gave me a non-answer with a smile and extreme politeness.\\"<br />That little  passage suggests that, though he may be an excellent diarist, Ellis must  have been a lousy reporter, one completely lacking in the objectivity  supposedly required by the<br />profession.  If Elvis had had access to Ellis'  diary, he might have answered Ellis' question with a question of his own:  \\"How can YOU justify asking ME that question when you did not ask it of  Grace Kelly, who not only acquired enormous wealth in her acting career,  but married into more millions by bagging Prince Rainier of  Monaco?\\"<br />Ellis interviewed Kelly in 1956, an experience detailed in his  entry of January 11 that year.  His questions to her are never more  challenging than this one:  \\"Will you see the prince today?\\"  (p. 232)  Ellis didn't ask Clark Gable's widow how her late husband justified the  millions he made when school teachers were underpaid, nor did the reporter  grill composer Irving Berlin on the matter either.  Apparently it was  alright for Kelly, Gable, and Berlin to make millions because Ellis  appreciated their \\"talents,\\" but Presley and rock and roll didn't pass  muster with \\"America's Greatest Diarist,\\" as Ellis is called on the jacket  of his book, and, therefore, it was wrong for Presley to strike it rich.  The question, if it was worthy of being asked at all, should have been  directed at a society that values performers more than it does the teachers  in whose hands our children's education is placed.<br />That being said,  Ellis' book is a worthwhile read for anyone interested in fine writing and  a purely subjective (and, as noted, sometimes hypocritical) account of life  as it was lived and observed by Ellis in the 20th century.ok, and, therefore, it was wrong for Presley to strike it rich.

Of course,  everyone who states an opinion (\\"I like it,\\" \\"I don't like it\\") is playing  the role of critic, including Reynolds, and the best critics do not tell  people what they have a right to like.  They tell you what THEY like and  why.  The professional film critic who does his job right is simply a more  thoughtful member of the audience who takes the time and possesses the  wisdom to explain why a film hits the target or fails to do so.  Roger  Ebert takes the time and has wisdom to spare.  The fact that the Pulitzer  Prize winning Chicagoan is America's most popular critic is probably a  happy accident owing less to his skill than to TV exposure (there was a  time when Gene Shalit and gossip-monger Rona Barrett were probably the two  most popular \\"critics\\" thanks to their gigs on morning television), but  Ebert's status is richly deserved.  He genuinely loves movies, and that  love is evident throughout his various collections of film reviews,  including the excellent Movie Yearbook.  He is smart without being pompous,  funny without being cruel, and wise without being pedantic.  He is also  thorough, seeing and writing reviews of even the most obscure movies,  including those that may be deemed unworthy of attention by other critics  at big city newspapers.  You may not always agree with him, but it's  doubtful you'll ever read one of his reviews without being enlightened,  amused, or, best of all, encouraged to see something you may have otherwise  missed.  Anyone for whom movies are more than mere entertainment but an art  form with the potential to change the way the audience looks at life,  should find a place on their bookshelves for Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook.	1999-11-18

Praise is unhesitantly heaped upon an obscure mediocrity like William Peter Blatty's \\"The Ninth  Configuration\\" (a whopping three-and-a-half stars) while a widely acknowledged classic, \\"Taxi Driver,\\" is dismissed with a measly two-and-a-half star rating.<br />Of course, no one is going to agree on every film, but sometimes Maltin doesn't agree with himself. Star ratings for some films change from one edition to the next, as do the text of the reviews. \\"Smokey and the Bandit\\" and  \\"Support Your Local Gunfighter\\" both went from one-and-a- half to three stars in the span of a year or two with no explanation offered for their sudden artistic rehabilitation.<br />But such criticisms are ultimately of little consequence. I like  movies and I like to read about movies.  I do not generally turn to critics  for suggestions on what to see, only to determine if they have any  interesting insights that I may have missed. You won't find much insight here, but Maltin's book is the best place to turn for a quick capsule commentary, and the relevant facts about a film (color or black-and-white, running time, cast, and director) with some occasional bits of trivia thrown in.	1999-06-16
