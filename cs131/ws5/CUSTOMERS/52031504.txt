I couldn't put it down because it was that good. The story is told by a woman from the time she was a child.This book is fiction but I feel gives a great portrayal of what it is like to be born into a Mormon family. She feels out of place within her own family as far back as she can remember. She is Born with a strong will and she defies everything about the Mormon religion, and questions everything she is told. You get to know her family and read about her struggles. I look forward to more books from this unique author.	2005-08-25

I enjoyed the first book \\"The Hot Flash Club\\" but I really enjoyed this book  much more! What I also liked about this book was it gave a \\"refresher\\" on the characters from the first book, so I was able to remember everyone. I really enjoyed all of the ladies in the stories. Also, you are able to differentiate between everyone because each woman has such a strong storyline. With so many books coming out focusing on relationships between 3-4 women, sometimes they blur into one another and you find you only care about what happens to 1 of them. That didn't happen with this book. Each character has her own amazing life, but each of them is blended well enough together to make the perfect read.	2005-04-08

Let's just say she goes way out of her way to bond with her \\"non\\" shopaholic sister who she has absolutely nothing in common with. Through trials and tribulations with Jess and her husband of 1 year, Luke, Becky shows that even though she is a shopaholic, she has a heart of gold and that is why people love her!	2004-11-05

I enjoyed reading it and laughed aloud at some parts of this book. I think the biggest problem with this book was the ending. It ended too soon. I believe it needed another chapter where they tell what each character is up to 5 years later. We need to find out how everything turned out for them! What also was sort of unbelievable was how these women became &quot;fast&quot; friends. I still think it's a fun read, just think the story could have been improved upon.	2004-02-10

We have 4 women who we really don't understand why they are &quot;long term&quot; friends. One is downright mean, and one is a &quot;no show&quot; for part of the book. The only characters worth reading about are Erin And Abby. I loved the start of each chapter where Erin gets a postcard from her Mom,and would have liked her to be introduced to the story in the end. Leave out 2 of the women and concentrate more on Erin and Abby. I also enjoyed reading about Boston. However, the ending fell quite flat.	2004-01-06

In this book you will find great Amish Fiction. You have 4 long stories, each one tied together with characters from the last story. Each story is clearly developed and you get to know the characters intimately and care about each of them. If you have enjoyed the books by Beverly Lewis, this book will surely add to your enjoyment about the Amish. My favorite one in this book is about the English girl who fell in love with an Amish guy, but each story is truly a gripping tale. You will enjoy it as well.	2003-11-23

Born and raised Amish, she fell in love with an &quot;Englisher&quot;. Wanting more out of life and searching for answers, she had to leave behind her family and was ultimately shunned by her family and the community. Her story is told with truth and Love.

The story line could have easily been wrapped up in 175 pages. The title itself leads you to think it will be a different book, but it turns out to be your typical romance with lots of sexual tension. The jacket of the book even tells of a different kind of story, leading you to believe that this book will be edgy. It made me edgy just to have to finish it.

My favorite parts of the book were about his childhood, and all of the different diets that he tried. I do have to agree with both of the other reviews written. Richard only skimmed the surface of his private life now, not answering the question we all have on our minds.

The robbery/murder didn't sway me in any way and I guess I never felt the terror the author was trying to conjure up. Then, my second problem is my belief that usually people involved in a crime don't want to see one another again or be reminded of the crime in any way. So, why would these 3 women who really don't have much in common become friends? While you could figure out what would happen when each woman stated what her dreams and regret's were,  I do feel that the story in general was entertaining and worth reading. While there were too many characters in this book, it did have a great ending. I would say this is a good book to read on vacation or at the beach.	2002-07-01

I believe it is juliahavey.com. As everyone who has read this book has pointed out, the grammar is not correct. Look past this problem to Julia's story. For those indivuals who need a \\"step by step what to eat every minute\\" kind of program, then Julia's book is not for you. But, for those who are looking for good advice and inspiration, then this book does accomplish that. If you are currently following a sensible diet plan, this book will help to keep you motivated. There is no miracle diet, and Julia makes that very clear. Sensible advice and motivation are the reasons why I rated this book a ****.	2002-01-30

Her surgery was certainly not the easy way out. After the surgery it takes hard work and dedication to acheive the goal of weight loss. My only drawback in rating this book is that there is more of Carnie's story to tell. And since I am not interested in the surgery I found the Q&amp;A section to be something I didn't need to read. If Carnie writes a follow up to this book, I will certainly take the time to read it.<BR>Buy this book if you are interested in Carnie, and/or interested in bypass surgery!	2001-12-14

Well, Carnie is that someone! Now, for those of you who  don't like cursing, this may not be the book for you. But, for those who aren't bothered by the way she speaks and thinks (and that includes a certain 4 letter word) which she does use from time to time, then go on and buy this book. Carnie comes across very open and honest about everything, from her weight, to drugs, to her sexuality. This is definitely a &quot;tell all&quot; book and Carnie doesn't hold much back. I found her story to be fascinating, and she is definitely someone I would like to get to know better. You can never really know someone by looking at them and not speaking to them or learning their ways. Carnie tells all, and shares her pain, anger and frustration. The only drawback I found to this book was that too  much is dedicated to the surgery part in the end. With a &quot;Q &amp; A&quot; section. I do not need the surgery, but wanted to learn more about the person. This book will give you insight into Carnie and also the surgery for those who are considering the procedure.	2001-12-12

How these 2 people could call  themselves Christians is beyond me. Meg must have a real problem with men  to begin with. She has little trust in men. She is expecting a man to be  perfect with no past. She is too skittish, unforgiving and too judgemental.  No wonder this woman had to fabricate a boyfriend/husband!   In normal  life, Bruce would have given up long ago on this woman. To fabricate such a  lie and follow through on it to the point they did proves they have no real  solid belief in God. They each had the  opportunity to come clean with each  other about their true feelings long ago. I think the author had to write a  certain amount of pages, because she could have wrapped this story up 200  pages earlier. A waste of time and money.	2000-08-20

I was glad to find that these two were not just  a side story. Once I got to know David I really felt for him regarding his  childhood. I wanted to see him happy. Even though Belle was the main  character, I felt like the other characters were as important to the story  as she was. Each character was well developed.

I read it slowly because I hated to see it end. This book had a perfect mix between past and present. How things in our childhood affect our lives. Hard to catogorize in just one way. It's  not so much a romance, as it is a story of survival. The heroine in the  story has a wonderful sense of humor. You will fall in love with the locale  as well. I have never read a story like it and would recommend it to  anyone. You will laugh, cry and and feel better about life in general.	2000-05-22

This book doesn't hold your interest like &quot;The Shunning&quot; did.  It took me double the amount of time to read, and I pretty much had the plot figured out  early on. Still- I am sure I will read the follow up book coming soon from  Beverly Lewis.	1999-09-11

I should know, since I had something similar happen to me. I also went in  the same direction as the  character, and eventually found true happiness! Any woman who has known  love and lost love (not to mention facing a mid life crisis) needs to read  this book! It covers all of the emotions you want to feel when reading a  GREAT book! Can't wait for more from this author!!	1999-07-23

It has a unique love story. And, anyone fascinated by the Amish country is sure to love the background. Don't miss it-then go on to the 2 sequels afterward. A series  not to be missed!	1999-07-16

I hope Beverly Lewis does more on the subject. I am truly interested in how the Amish live, and have visited the Amish country many times. I loved how Katie and Dan finally got together.	1999-07-14

I hated to see it end. This book is an inspiration to all of us. When you have the chance between choosing Mr. Perfect and Mr. Perfect for you,  which way does your heart tell you to go? We all need to be reminded that  beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This book grabs you from the very  start. Everyone can relate to this book, so don't miss it!	1999-07-14

Ms. Steel should go back and review her earlier works!! Read &quot;The Long Road Home&quot; by Danielle Steel. That  was her more recent GREAT book! The Klone had a totally unbelievable  premise and  was a  waste of time!	1999-07-09

The writer kept repeating the same problems with the in-laws over and over again. I figured out the plot before the stupid heroine did! And, who cared about the stupid  leash law?? I stayed with this story hoping it would get better, but it  never did! My advice is to save your money. Wish I had done that myself.	1999-07-09

You could predict where the story was headed from the start. I felt no empathy whatsoever for the main  character. It had no twists and turns to speak of. Nothing to keep you on  the edge of your seat. Ms. Steel should consider starting to write quality  rather then quantity. Save your time (and money) and don't bother with this  book.	1999-07-08

Like all of Jackie Collins material, this one lived up to my expectations! I was sad to see it end. I look forward to the next chapter in the Lucky Santangelo/Lennie Golden love affair. And, the story line about Bridgette  had me at the edge of my seat. Well worth the time!	1999-07-04
US	52031504	R3ONTL6JP146BE	0671747150	728771067	Fancy Pants	Books	4	1	2	N	N	an interesting combination	You have the main character of Francesa who really grabs your attention. What she winds  up doing with her life is truly inspirational. But, she falls for a guy who I don't find particularly interesting. And, I don't  really see how they fit together. He is angry and treats her like dirt. I  didn't care much for him at all, and couldn't picture these 2 together.   SEP has a habit of always having angry men in her novels, who these woman  have to tame. Still, in true SEP traditon, there is always a happy ending.	1999-07-04

Maybe it is because I am not into sports. This book had too much football in it for me to be totally absorbed by the story. Now, SEP can really write, but this  wouldn't be on my list of top 10 favorites.	1999-05-24

There were always twists and turns in this book, that held my interest to the final page. As with all of SEP books, I was sorry to see it end.  And, I love the location of  Hollywood for the setting for this book.	1999-03-06

I mean, a physicist and a football player?? She tricks him into sleeping with her, getting her pregnant and then he marries her??  I had a hard time pushing myself to  read this book. The last 50 pages were the best part of the book, though.  However,  I still never felt any chemistry between these two. I think the  story of  Cal's parents would have been much more interesting. In fact,  Cal's family was much more interesting then the main characters themselves.  Like I said, not bad, but not great either!!	1999-02-08

This book had an interesting plot line, but the ending could have been better. Nonetheless, still worth reading.	1999-01-27

After a hard day's work, it is an indulgence that screams &quot;I am worth it&quot;. The sex scenes were nice and hot! I  would definitely try to read other books by this Author-but I don't think  she has any others out  yet. But, I will keep my eyes open for them. So, if  you are looking for a great book to unwind with and put a smile on your  face, then buy this book!	1999-01-20
