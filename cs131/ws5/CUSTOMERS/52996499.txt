The presentation methodology; of giving brief descriptions and using tables or charts, where needed; makes the material very accessible to the seminarian and layperson alike.<br />Each chapter has a very useful Notes and Bibliography section should you wish to get deeper into any topic.<br /><br />This is an excellent tool that one can use for years to come.  Outstanding contribution.  Thank you.	2005-10-03

Abridgements of great works in and of themselves are not a bad thing.  As I read through this volume I could not but help noticing how poorly it reflected upon Freeman's original three volume work.<br /><br />Douglas Southall Freeman's Magnum Opus is distorted quite significantly in this abridgement.  If you have not read his original work I suppose this volume will suffice.  But why settle?  I frequently come across the original volumes at used bookstores for around $50-$60.<br /><br />Mr. Freeman's writing is good literature apart from being great history.  Though the original work is dated it still is a magnificient example of historical writing.  Mr. Freeman's work is what got me interested in Civil War history.	2005-09-18

I stumbled upon this jewel at the local Rancho Bernardo library.  My high school english teacher in India, Mr. F. X. Paul, owned a tattered copy and used to read to us aloud a page or two in his  grammar class.  It helped relieve our boredom brought upon by trying to memorize grammar rules and sentence parsing.<br /><br />Funk gives you a non-technical discourse on word etymologies.  Grouped by categories,  and sorted alphabetically, common english words and their history is explained.  The write-up on individual words is very interesting and makes for a superb read.  I was intrigued by  the history and usage of words like barrister and pettition.<br /><br />For a non-linguist like myself this book is a treasure trove of delight.  Excellent resource.	2005-09-01

This is my third read of Dunham's Journey Through Genius and I am still learning new stuff from this book.  The author has hit upon just the right blend of math and history to make this a gem.  There is enough mathematical rigor here to not render the work banal and as just another \\"popular math\\" book.  Reading this book I am reminded of Kline's Mathematics And The Physical World except that this text is less wordy and more focussed on seventeen landmarks of mathematics.<br /><br />Some theorems and proofs I have to read four or five times to really get the ideas behind them but the effort is worthwhile.<br /><br />If you want to make your 2005 summer reading more rewarding and challenging than usual get this book.  I have had this volume since 1992 and feed upon it at least twice a year.  My guess is this book will become a classic if it has not already.  A jewel that will become a true friend.	2005-05-30

This is an excellent book on what life was like for englishmen in British India.  John Beames was obviously a good writer and the narrative flows quite smoothly.  His description of Calcutta with some specific street names (Chowrangee) brought back memories because things did not appear to have changed much in 1968 when I was in Calcutta.<br /><br />I agree with the publisher that the first chapter on ancestry is quite turgid and boring.  So if you wish skip the first chapter.  You will not miss much.  Too bad that John Beames died before completing the book.  However, his grandson has a nice epilogue to the text.<br /><br />Much of what Beames states in the book sounds familiar to me.  I used to know a guy in Hyderabad, whose granddad was a \\"assistant\\" to one of the British Collectors and much of what he said coincides with several narratives in the book.<br /><br />Of course in keeping with the times Beames had the usual prejudices against the natives but that was the culture in those days.<br /><br />I found it interesting that an intelligent perceptive man like John Beames seemed not to question the white elephant, viz., what in tarnation were the British, doing in India?	2005-05-02

I had not heard of it except per chance happened to stumble upon it in a bookstore in Bangalore, India.<br /><br />This book is an abridgement of the author's two volume work.  The writing is excellent and brisk.  A note of caution to fellow Americans.  The writing style is decidedly British and at first may seem a bit stilted and awkward.  But one soon gets used to it.<br /><br />Mr. Mason's analysis of history is excellent.  After a brief overview of major events the heart of the book is the analyses of said events.  Though one may not agree with every conclusion; there is much food for thought.  In my opinion the main legacy of the British was that of creating a nation by amalgamating a cacaphony of feifdoms and districts.  Prior to 1740, the Mughul rule, contrary to popular belief, did not encompass India as a whole but only some northern areas and those were disparate and ruled by ad hoc \\"laws\\".  Akbar tried to implement uniform laws and revenue estimations but met with marginal success.  Prior to the moghuls there were empires such as the Ashokan but these never emcompassed the India we know today.<br /><br />To date this is the BEST one volume work on the British experience in India.  Highly recommended.	2005-04-18

An embarassingly  one-sided shill.	I was hoping for a balanced analysis supporting the dinosaur extinctions via an asteroid doing a number on mother earth.  Instead I got a steady dose of denunciations towards anyone who disagreed with the asteroid theory.  The tone is palatable at first but after a while repeating the same canard over and over does tend to get tiresome.  Around page 170 or so I realized that I was reading an apologist for the asteroid theory.<br /><br />I was very disappointed that other theories were given short shrift and at times almost mocked.  This is a so so book about dinosaur extinctions but I am waiting for a truly meaty and balanced book.	2005-03-11

This is an excellent textbook of geology and some history of our national parks.  The text is organized by each park within geographic regions.  This is great and helps one to read up on a specific park BEFORE visiting it so as to get the most out of the trip.<br /><br />The layout, font size and pictures are great.  The explanation of the geology behind the landscape is just beautiful and quite meaty.  There is a CD that comes with the text and this is where I have a problem.  The CD has great pictures of the parks but that is it.  It would have been great if the CD came with some interactive stuff.<br /><br />With the book size being formidible it would have been great to have a folded handout along with the CD so that one could actually use it on a field trip.<br /><br />But all in all this is an excellent book and very useful to a non-geologist like myself.<br /><br />I would have given it a 5-star except that there is no handy cutout that effectively summarizes the book for use in the field.	2005-03-05

This is my favorite \\"Gettysburg book\\".  Coddington renders a thorough analytical tome on the campaign.  I found the writing to be impartial and guided mostly by historical facts.  Yes, in parts Coddington does give his opinion but that is clearly implied in the narrative.<br /><br />I have the paperback edition and the maps are somewhat lacking in definition.  Therefore, while reading have a Civil War Atlas handy.  I found that this vastly increased my understanding and appreciation of the work.<br /><br />This work, in my opinion, is the gold standard of the Gettysburg genre.  Excellent work.	2004-11-05

Of course from the perspective of the natives this was a Freedom Struggle NOT a mutiny.<br /><br />The work is littered with good references albeit from only the British side.  Why so?  Simple.  The corpus related to this event from the Indian side is extremely scant and also very unreliable.  I recall back in 1959 my High School teacher, Mr. Luke DeSouza, advised us to take the account of the Mutiny with a fist full of salt.  He noted that history written by occupiers was terribly slanted but deserved a thorough analysis.<br /><br />Yes, the British were racists and looked upon Indians as little more than chattel.  But I dare say so were many Indians towards one another.  The culture of the times was far too complex for us today to render bumper-sticker labels to either side.<br /><br />This book uses mostly British sources of events.  Bearing that caveat in mind jump in.  All in all a good read.	2004-09-27

The premise linking a forged Dickinson poem, forged Mormon documents, and the forger enticed me to read this book.<br /><br />Parts of the book describing how forgeries are done and detected were very interesting.  Alas however, there are no pictures of the forged documents that the author talks about.  Thus you are left to your imagination when things such as \\"the second loop in the S\\" come up.  Finally, I printed off samples of \\"The Oathe(sic) Of a Freeman\\", \\"Salamander Letter\\", and \\"Anthon Transcripts\\" from the web.  Do this if you want to follow the descriptions in the book.<br /><br />Often the author states \\"in pictures of Hoffman from the...\\".  But NONE of these pictures are in the book.  This took a lot away from the quality of the work.  Behind the book there are two pictures of Dickenson poems, one forged and one real.  That's it.<br />The writing is good in parts but somewhat disjointed as a flowing narrative.<br />There is nothing new in regards to the forger, Mark Hoffman, and his Mormon forgaries.	2004-09-01

This is my second reading of Zinn's classic account of American History.  Please be forewarned!  This book will likely make you uncomfortable about what our past was.  No matter.  In the end when all is said and done we are a product of what we were and judging by what America is today we have done very well.<br />Zinn gives you a perspective on history that is different from other scholars (ex. Samuel Eliot Morison).  There is the good, the bad and the plain very bad.  Ther are no glossy pictures and maps.<br />The writing is crisp and the text is peppered with anecdotes.  This is not a &quot;leftist&quot; view of American history.  All nations have their skeletons.  This book bares it all.<br />How amazing is America!  In spite of all we have made tremendous progress. Some reviews have categorized Zinn as a &quot;leftist&quot; with an axe to grind.  I found no such bias.  Instead I suspect the author's love for his country shows by his precise depiction of our past.<br />This is a book that will require some honest introspection.  An excellent work that needs to be read by all Americans.	2003-05-01

There are numerous pictures and illustrations that supplement the text.<br />My knowledge of Hinduism was mainly from reading books by Western authors.  This book gives one a Hindu perspective.  Although I was born in India I did not realize how scant my knowledge of Hinduism was.  I verily suspect that many Hindus will find a nugget or two in this book.<br />The book format is more akin to the coffee table genere but this is one of those display books that is actually quite useful.<br />I do have a cavil.

This still ranks as one of my favorite relativity books.  There is virtually no math to speak of.  Yet, the author in a very descriptive way, will take you from Aristotelian view to the Galilean view and finally to the relativistic paradigm.  Concepts such as events, event horizons, interval etc. are explained quite beautifully.  The idea of the interval and the physics and geometry of the same is shown in a most interesting way.<br />The chapters are organized very well and the writing is very good.  To follow the text a certain degree of concentration is required because the diagrams need to be checked as one proceeds.<br />This text is quite suitable for junior high and high school students not to mention college graduates who wish to know something beyond the cursory in relativity theory.<br />I happened to come across this book at a used bookstore in 1979.  Very few of my friends were even aware of this book.  It was one of those sleepers so much so that a while back this volume had gone out of publication.  However, now it's back, thank God. If you want a non-technical but quite thorough peek into General Relativity get this book.  If you are one of those who would prefer a tad more math and a less wordy introduction go with James A.

I have read this book many times since I was first introduced to it in 1984.  The book is about classical pianists, their styles and piccadelloes intermingled with the author's opinions.  The writing is great.  Yes, as some reviewers have opined, certain facets of the art have been treated too briefly.  But one cannot expect an academic tome in a book directed to the general public.  I found the book very educational and entertaining.  If you have had no classical music training, such as myself, you will learn quite a bit from the book.  If you are a classical pianist this book will whet your appetite to plunge further into your love of music.  A great addition to your library.	2003-04-10

The layout and font quality is good. I spend hours just going over the notes.<br />A word of caution. A goodly portion of the notes are intermingled with OPINION and conclusions based upon said opinion. Many of the conclusions are flat out wrong such as the one about the pre-Adamic earth.  Many other conclusions are obtuse to say the least, such as the one about the Trinity.  Therefore, take much of the notes as \\"commentary\\" and NOT as exposition of the Bible text per se. As with all commentaries, validate the author's exposition based upon YOUR study of God's Word and other commentaries.<br />A strong feature of this work are the numerous LISTS. Such as the Names Of God, Doctrines In John, etc. Another great feature is the question and answer sections on some books like Joshua. One can learn quite a bit from these sections.<br />If you are a believer who is charismatically bent this Bible is a treasure.

The chapters on Momentum and Energy and Particles of Zero Mass are plain excellent.<br />Since no calculus to speak of is used some of the &quot;derivations&quot; are quite awkard.

The book has a tendency to imply that all word problems follow the same language, such as &quot;twice as much as C&quot;, etc.  Therefore please be cautious not to fall into the trap of memorizing phrases and their corresponding algebraic connotation.	2002-02-01

This text was a standard in the 1960s for folks who wanted to bursh up on their High School algebra.  The format is pedagogical in the British style from the 1940-50s era.<br />I have always found this to be a faithful companion when I find myself forgetting basic algebraic tasks such as simultaneous equations, factoring, etc.  The writing is simple and easy to follow.  There are numerous exercises to reinforce the material.<br />There is one drawback.  I have found quite a few errors in the solutions within the text AND in some of the answers to exercises.  However, if one is familiar with the material these shortcomings can be easily excused.<br />If you are just beginning to learn algebra go with &quot;Practical Algebra &quot; by Selby et al.  However if you have take the subject before and just want to brush up basic High School algebra get this volume.	2002-01-13

This is an excellent text to get you into New Testament studies.  The author clearly has deep respect, awe, and love for the NT canon.  However, all sides of an issue are presented in a direct and scholarly manner with lots of references.  Guthrie comes down strongly on the side of inerrancy AFTER discussing all other views.  The writing is excellent.<br />Do not expect pretty pictures and slick shiny pages in this text.  Instead what you will get is a great reference book that you will use repeatedly.  My 1971 edition is worn out so I bought the recent edition.  Also this edition has many more references incorporating recent work.<br />I do have one caveat.  Before you delve into this book please be sure that you have a good working knowledge of the NT.  If you do not then get one of the survey books first.  There are excellent survey texts put out by folks like Gundry, Kromaki, and others.<br />I cannot say enough about the quality of this work.  If you are serious about NT scholarship rush out and get this book.  You may not agree with the author's theology in all areas but the book is definitely a MUST.  Definitely a valuable addition for your study of the New Testament.	2002-01-12

This six volume set is a treasure trove of Biblical and Historical scholarship.  The contributors are all well regarded in their respected disciplines.  Virtually ALL aspects of Biblical scholarship is treated in a cogent manner.  The writing and layout of the set is excellent.  Topics ranging from prehistory to the Temple layout to the destruction of the Second Temple and numerous other details are explained in a superb manner.  The scholarship is top notch.<br /><br />I have owned this set since 1994 and find myself frequently looking something up in these volumes.  Just pick up one of the volumes and turn to a topic at random.  Chances are you'll be hooked.  Do not let the title dissuade you from getting this set.  Even if you are not into Biblical scholarship this set will give you a lifetime of fulfilling study.<br />If you are a serious student of the Jewish and/or Christian Bible then this set is a must.  If you are a history buff this set will be a valuable addition to your library.<br />What a treasure!	2002-01-11

After three attempts over the past two years I finally finished this book.  The text is an excellent introduction to Quantum Mechanics but DOES require some mathematical ability.  Often I would get lost in the derivations.  However, on the second and third attempts things begin to make sense.  The text does show all the steps involved in the derivations and that helps.  You could skip the math but then the book loses it's value and you will not get much out of the text.  If you are formally trained in Quantum mechanics this book will serve as a review.  However, if you, are just curious, this text is great.  Be prepared for a tough read.	2002-01-08

I read this book over the holidays and throughly enjoyed the experience.  The text is a compilation of lectures for the general public on QED.  The explanations of light and matter interactions are superb considering that there is no math to speak of in the text.<br />Do NOT expect this to be a easy read.  The book does require concentration and some effort on the part of the reader.  I found myself reading some of the chapters twice just to ensure that I understood the material.<br />I do have one cavil.  I wish Dr. Feynman had included a reference section for &quot;further reading&quot;.  Perhaps one of his students will include the references in the next revised edition.<br /><br />All in all a fine book that deserves your attention.	2001-12-27

This book will give you a superb introduction to basic mathematics culminating in the CALCULUS.  The topics and manner of presentations are excellent.  I have the 1978 edition that I still use to much benefit.  Things such as numbers, matrices, algebra and trig are introduced in rapid but detailed segments.  If you have been away from mathematics for a while you will soon get drawn into the text and the exercises.  If you are into math today this will serve as an excellent review and perhaps give you a gem or two.  However, if you have been put off by math in the past you may want to approach with caution.  For even though the pace is within speed limits the text does expect a good effort to reap the rewards.  I recommend this book for anyone interested in the theory behind mathematics.  A real jewel for your library and personal enjoyment.  Just superb!	2001-09-11

The slant is geared towards the major personalities involved in it's development. The key players of course were: Feynman, Schwinger, Dyson, and Tomonaga. The text is quite detailed and is directed towards the academic community and assumes a cursory knowledge of quantum mechanics. That being the case, I got lost in much of the math. However, I kept at it and got much out of the book. If you are a physics major then this book will be a jewel to own. What an experience to &quot;see&quot; the human mind come up with ideas which at first glance seem impossible but later turn out to be perfectly true. The writing is quite turgid as is the case with books put out by Princeton, but the material is just fantastic. If the math overwhelms you, as it did me, just get the main idea down and forge on. Later, if time and patience permits re-visit the portion that got you lost and try again. I did this but still am lost in many areas. Nevertheless, a great read!!	2001-09-10

This text in Biochemistry is a great introduction. I was quite familiar with Lubert Stryer's masterpiece but I must confess this textbook goes one step further. The slant is towards the med student and the notes on medical aspects are just plain fantastic. It took me almost a year to finish the book but the effort was well worth it. Besides I have been out of touch with Biochem since my college days. Aspects of RNA metabolism are plain fantastic!! What is more the layout and sequence of topics is just right. I found that using this text in conjunction with &quot;Basic Medical Biochemistry&quot; by Marks, Marks, and Smith will give you the best mix. Don't pass on this gem. It truly is worth your time and perusal. The cost is steep but textbooks usually are. Grab it!!	2001-08-26

My wife Brenda and I have used this book numerous times at our place in Kentucky and during our hikes in the Smokies.  Even though the title specifies Kentucky we found the book very useful in Tennessee during our romps in the Great Smokey Mountains.  A Notable feature that is very handy is the &quot;roomy look&quot; of the layout.  There is copious amount of white space on every page.  We used that to make notes and scribbles.  Now when I turn to any page I recall the spring or fall at Clingman's Dome, Cumberland Gap or a dozen other places.<br />Some of the pictures are not quite as good.  For example, on page 157, the snapshot of Prostrate Eryngo (E. yuccifolium) is misleading.  In spite of minor quibbles this is a book well worth having.  I must warn you that because of the glossy pages the book does weigh between two and three pounds which is significant when one is scrambling up an incline.<br />A real memory-maker!	2001-08-10

This book will give you a perspective that was quite common amongst the &quot;educated Indians&quot; during the waning days of the Raj.  The writing is somewhat turgid though quite colorful in parts.  I read this book in small doses just to savor and reflect upon an era long gone.  The descriptions of family life and personalities are delightful and vivid.<br />This however, is not a easy read.  If you expect a fast-paced juicy narrative then you will be disappointed.  If you enjoy a meaty jaunt through late 19th and early 20th century India then by all means get it.  A word of caution.  When reading the author's opinions please realize the times from whence they spring.	2001-08-08

This book will give you a good general introduction to the concept of infinity.  I found the presentation informal and quite easy to follow.  Since the book was first written in 1943 and revised in 1960 there are some units that are not used anymore.  For example, the coinage of pounds, shillings, and pence is dead.  Things like a chapter on &quot;The Charts Get Smoothed Out&quot;, may seem round about but still interesting.  My favorite chapter is &quot;Mathematics Is One&quot;.  The derivation of &quot;visual forms&quot; in functions is excellent.<br />Have pen and paper handy because to really enjoy the book I found myself doing some of the &quot;the reader can solve for himself...&quot;  stuff.  Another point is that you can more or less read the chapters independently and in no particular order and still reap huge benefits from the material.<br />Thank God for Dover which still publishes this book.  My copy is a 1976 edition.  If you are interested in getting back in touch with things you may have long forgotten get this book.	2001-07-09

I trudge back to this book again and again, being embarassed at having forgotten some basic idea or technique.  This is an excellent supplemental text to a formal Calculus textbook like &quot;Calculus &quot; by Stewart.  The writing is lucid and ideas are explained with the novice in mind.  I find that reading this book first BEFORE getting into a meatier textbook helps me understand the material.<br />My experience has been that if I do not &quot;do calculus&quot; at least twice a week I forget the techniques (not ideas) almost immediately.  Therefore, if you want a review of Calculus this book is a great tool.  If you are new to calculus this book will help you understand important concepts like differentiation vs integration.  I also found that reading pertinent chapters in Selby's &quot;Geometry and Trigonometry For Calculus&quot; and then reading related material in this book is a tremendous help.<br />Another strong point is that for us over 50 the font size and book layout is easy on the eye.  So whether you are a novice or someone who has not had the chance to use Calculus in a while; or someone &quot;brand new&quot; to Calculus,  get this book.  An excellent resource for learning and entertainment!!	2001-07-09

Major areas of mathematics are explored with pertinent examples.  The writing is good and the layout of the material is superb.  Just pick a topic at random, read through the material, and then work the examples.  There are no exercises.  For instance, the chapter; Derivatives and Differentials, is superb with some history included.  The material serves very well as a refresher rather than as a &quot;teacher&quot;.  So if you have not been exposed to Calculus before do NOT expect to learn it here.<br />This book; for example, will NOT teach you Calculus.  But it WILL  whet your appetite sufficiently for you to delve deeper. On the other hand if you have already had Calculus the book will serve as an excellent refresher and reference source.  I usually read a topic two to three times before I really get the idea and technique involved.<br />An excellent reference that I use quite often.	2001-05-28

This book gets one excited about physics.  Common physical phenoman like rate, speed, mass and force are explained in very ingenious ways.  What is more the writing is good and to the point.  Even though there is not much math to speak of the author explains things in a concise manner.  What got me hooked to this book is that it does require thinking on part of the reader.  One quickly finds out that what may seem intuitive and common sense is in fact precisely the wrong answer.  Another major advantage of the book is that you do not have to read it from page one onwards.  Turn to any segment and you are sure to be sucked in.  Page after page is filled with nice little nuggets of fun.  Get this book you will not regret it.	2001-05-11

Though long (908 pages), the writing is crisp and precise.  There is sufficient detail here that justifies the subject.  Isaac Newton was arguably the greatest mathematician that ever lived except perhaps for Mersene.  Every aspect of Newton's life is described in good detail.  There is enough mathematics here to justify the biographical needs and to interest the reader to explore further.  If you wish to get more of Newton's mathematics I recommend his Principia which is still a good read.<br />All in all this book is excellent.  The nature and scope of the subject matter demands that the book be long.  But the time and effort spent will be richly rewarded.	2001-03-01

I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  McCullough does an excellent job of telling a story.  The early part of the book dealing with the French experience is excellent.  Reading this section I felt like I was there.<br />The middle portion of the book dealing with the political wrangling and intrigue in Washington got a little tedious for me.  How malaria and yellow fever were virtually eradicated is a tale worth noting.<br />The final portion of the book describing the actual building of the canal is terrific.  The canal was truly an engineering marvel of its day. Both the French and American efforts were truly heroic.<br />If you want a good read and a great story to boot this book is it.	2001-02-28

This is a solid work from the conservative perspective.  The single authorship and premillennial ideas are adhered to stringently in this volume.<br /> Material here is presented very well in a logical and lucid manner.  Chapters one through four give excellent background information pertaining to history and authorship of the book of Isaiah.  I find it remarkable that the entire scope of Isaiah is presented so well in a SINGLE volume.<br /> I do have two quibbles.  One, the book lacks detail on important aspects  such as Christology and Authorship.  Two, there are NO charts that summarize cogently important theological concepts derived from Isaiah.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in delving deeper into the great book of Isaiah.  Even if one does not hold or agree with the author's theology this is a book that deserves your attention.  Well worth your time.	2001-02-12

The authors skilfully comingle history, mathematics, philosophy, and biography.  The result is a truly fantastic voyage into the meaning and gist of discovery and conjecture.  In chapter after chapter important ideas like Fourier analysis, Non-Cantorian Set Theory, and Objects and Structures are scrutinized in a very interesting manner.<br />The deeper you go into the book the more will you revel in the sheer majesty and scope of the topics.  I had to read the chapter on Inner Issues twice to really get everything out of the text.  Topics such as Teaching and Learning are very insightful and full of little hidden gems.<br />If you are prepared to expend some effort and if you wish to know what mathematics &quot;really is like&quot;, grab this book.  I am sure this will become a permanent treasure in your library and you will peruse it often long into the night.	2001-02-12

If you have been away from Algebra for a while or even if you have just started learning Algebra this book is for you.  The authors have done a truly masterful job of explaining the basic concepts of Algebra.  But more than that, the book has frequent tests and exercises which will help you to see if you are truly learning the stuff.  Another great feature is that things are presented in a succinct and cogent manner.  There is no patronizing prose or cute stories to bore you.<br />One thing I recommend strongly.  Get well versed with chapters 2 through 4.  These are the &quot;nail and hammer&quot; chapters in the book. Techniques like factoring, exponent manipulations, and simplification are explained.  If you do not get these techniques nailed down you will be hounded with difficulties in later chapters.  I re-read the chapters 3 times as well as worked the problems.  I also recommend that as you go along begin solving pertinent problems from &quot;REA'S Algebra &amp; Trigonometry Problem Solver&quot;.  This may take some time but your efforts will be well rewarded.<br />I highly recommend this text for anyone learning Algebra.  But specially if you are like myself, just &quot;doing&quot; Algebra after a long hiatus, grab this book.  A must have !	2001-02-11

This book is a great tool for those who have been away from algebra, geometry, and trig for a short while.  The author treats one to a 'no nonsense' crash course in basic concepts.  This being the case, the book is fast paced and very crisp.  There is not much 'hand holding' here.  Topics are explained quite well and to the point with a good number of exercises.<br />One caveat though.  If you have been away from math for say 10 - 20 years you will often get lost wading through the material.  The text does assume that one's thinking process is still attuned to basic skills such as the &quot;two sign change&quot; rule in a compound expression. Therefore if you find that you have forgotten the tricks involved in things like factoring you will be better served to first go with say &quot;Practical Algebra: A self teaching Guide&quot; and &quot;Geometry and Trig for Calculus&quot;.  Both by Selby et al.<br />However, if you've been away from math for only a short time (&lt; 5  years), by all means get this book.	2001-02-05

This book is geared to the general reader who has a cursory knowledge of mathematics.  The chapters are organized around physical phenomena and the math behind their explanation.  The result is a charming and VERY useful book.  I have the 1970 edition which is quite worn from frequent use.  The chapter titled, Differential Equations - The Heart Of Analysis, is exceptionally beautiful and pertinent.  Reading this book is akin to a treasure hunt.  There is page after page of mathematical discovery.  Reading the chapter on  Motion Of Projectiles  made me terribly angry at the banal way in which this topic is handled in high school texts.  Things such as quadratic equations and the law of gravitation are explained very well.  I sincerely believe that this book should be a required text for High School math students.  Highly recommended.  The Dover edition is very affordable so even if it means foregoing a meal, do it.  Buy this book!  Well worth your time.	2001-01-24

A strong point of this biography is the extensive research and documentation that backs up the text.  Einstein's life in science AND out of it are explored thoroughly.  My only quibble is that the quality of pictures in the text is shoddy.  I have the Penguin edition.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book.  If you want a quick superficial biography try Banesh Hoffman's Einstein (still in print?). If you want a fairly good biography I recommend Denis Brian's Einstein.

Books	4	46	52	N	Y	A sobering and melancholic narrative of slavery....	I purchased this book from Amazon in September but just managed to finish it this weekend.  Why the delay?  The book is a hard and melancholic read.  In page after page Fanny Kemble narrates the abomination and sheer evil of slavery.  We are introduced to folks who pious in their ways and beliefs show absolutely no compassion or outrage towards sanctioned barbarism.  There is the case of one little girl who cannot conceive or imagine the notion that she can be a free woman.  Then there is the sanctimonious Mr. Butler who is supposed to be a &quot;good massa&quot; to the chattel that is his property.  I cannot begin to chronicle the innumerable injustices done to fellow humans.<br />But then in the midst of this filth there is a bright shinning light.  That light is Fanny.  This brave and intellignet lady fought against big odds to somewhat improve the plight of the slaves on her husband's plantation.  Often not taken seriously, or worse treated condescendingly, Fanny nevertheless kept at it.<br />The first five chapters are a delight to read.  They narrate her journey to the plantation along with her experiences at stops along the way.  But from then on be prepared for a long sad book.  This is an important book that deserves your attention.  The next time I visit one of those beautiful antebellum mansions with the aroma of magnolia's in the air I will remember the cost of human lives wasted.  I will remember Fanny.	2000-12-04

This is a general mathematics text specifically written at the junior college level.  The book begins with the number system and surveys the whole gamut from Algebra to Trig to Matrices to Calculus.  I use this text to refresh my skills AFTER reading a standard college textbook (ex. Stewart's Calculus).  There are numerous worked problems.  A great feature are the boxed segments that show formulae and special rules. The layout of the text is very good with wide margins and a good font size.

This book is very good for getting up to speed in algebra.  If you have not taken algebra in a while, this book will help you in evaluating your progress.  An important feature is that sample solutions are explained in incremental steps.  The explanations pertain more to technique than to the theory behind the problems.  I first brush up on a topic in a general algebra text and then use this book to reinforce the concepts.  Another benefit of this book is that solving problem after problem gives one a sense of accomplishment that may get side-tracked in other textbooks.	2000-12-02

I wanted a book that would show me actual field situations of common geologic phenomenon.  Being a novice, I needed something that I could easily carry and that would not undermine detail.  Maley's excellent book fills the bill very well.  The numerous illustrations and photographs in this book are extremely useful if you want to &quot;see&quot; and understand geology.  Many of the pictures have inset scale standards, such as quarters and measuring rulers, that give one a good comparasion of the rocks and sediments involved.  I also appreciate the black and white pictures.  Often geology texts go in for snazzy color pictures that often blurr important detail.  If you want a good field guide that you can actually use this book is for you.	2000-09-24

This book presents all aspects of photysynthesis in a fairly detailed manner.  The material here covers everything form mitochondrial structure to phytochromes.  There is just enough information here to keep the material brisk yet cogent.  There are numerous charts and good quality illustrations.  The electron transport cycle and phosphorylation sections deserve special mention for their beauty and usefulness.  The 'Research in Photosynthesis' chapter is very good, except that I have the fifth edition (1994),and my guess is the material may be quite dated.  I highly recommend this book for an under-graduate course in photosynthesis.  If you wish to know what photosynthesis is and the why and how of an important biological function buy this book.  Over and above being a very good biology book the discourse is presented in a elegant manner.	2000-09-20

This book will serve you well as a refresher in geometry and trig.  Major  facets of both subjects are dealt with in a brief but highly effective  manner.  There are just the right number of examples and exercises.  This  book can also be used as a auxillary text for first year college students.  What a pleasure to read and DO some of the problems.  I wish I had this  crutch when I was sweating bullets learning calculus back in 1961.  The  trig portion is somewhat shallow but all in all a excellent book.	2000-09-14

Last month I began browsing my 1962 edition of Introductory Mycology.  Lo  and behold I read through the whole book over a weekend.  This book was our  bible for the Mycology 100 course in grad school.  I was noticing how good  the narrative and drawings were in this classic.  The book is not a glitzy  tome so common in textbooks today.  Each class of fungi is dealt with  separately and there are extensive references at the end of each chapter.  Of course because of the date of my edition some of the references are  dated.  However, the basic science here is solid and presented in a  pedagogical manner.  The chapter on class Basidiomycetes deserves special  mention.  The basidium development narrative is just superb. If you have an  interest in fungi and want to delve deeper into this important living group  then get this book.  It will serve you well for years to come just as it  has done for me.	2000-09-14

Last week I was re-reading this classic that I had in an old edition  (1965).  I then began the current edition and found that Gardner's  contribution definitely upgrades this book from  moderately good to very  good.  I have been using this book for years as an entertaining read  specially with maxima and minima concepts.  This current edition has some  of the language updated to conform with modern usage.  The book still  inspires me to dig deeper into the calculus.  The writing is succinct and  the illustrations are quite good.  After reading this book delve into James  Stewart's  Calculus.	2000-09-08

I bought this treasure back in 1973 but I  still go back to it at least twice a week.  The writing is uneven because  of the different authors who have contributed articles.  However, the  substance of the book is top notch.  Starting with the number system all  the way to the differential calculus and parts of game theory, the book is  a treasury of mathematical delights.  Just pick a chapter, and you are sure  to be sucked in.  Another point I wish to make is the design and layout of  the books.  There are no slick, extra large, shiny page designs here.  Just  plain 6 by 8 size pages with appropriate black and white diagrams.  This is  when books used to be more like friends, often in one's company, and much  perused.  It is truly a shame that this series is out of print.  If you  happen to find it somewhere introduce yourself!!	2000-09-06

I purchased this book to find out how clinical issues were taught in  medical schools.  To my surprise I found the topics quite interesting and  comprehensible.  The writing is turgid and the font is quite small.  Yet,  when some health issue comes up, Harrison's is my first stop.  I just pick  a topic at random and go through the article.  Occasionally, if a term does  not make sense to me I check with my copy of Steadman's.  I truly believe  that this book makes for a good family medical reference if one is willing  to put in some effort.  Well worth the shelf space in my library.	2000-08-25

The late Frank Netter has done us a great service in producing this  classic.  The paintings are just right.  What impressed me was how well  some of the labeling is done.  For example, Plate 318, showing the blood  vessels in parenchyma of the kidney, is dense with notations. Yet one does  not get lost between the body part and its label.  I much prefer this atlas  to Pernkopf's work.  To get the most out of this book, get Gray's Anatomy,  the 38th British Edition (none other please !!!!), as a reading exercise  followed by a &quot;viewing&quot; in Netter's book.  Truly a gem.	2000-08-25

I re-read Woodworth's excellent treatise on Jefferson Davis and his  involvement in the Western Theater.  The chapters are succinct and focus  more on strategy than in specific battle details.  My favorite parts are  the reviews at the end of each chapter.  I have always believed that Lee's  strategy to invade the North rather than deploying his forces in the West  was a major blunder.  If there is one salient point that screams from this  book it is that Jeff Davis' personal relationships with his generals  (Polk??) definitely was a detriment to his decision making.  This book  should be required reading for high school and undergraduate students.  Indeed any leader could profit from the analysis and history rendered here.	2000-08-20

This is a fascinating book of letters to Abe Lincoln by people from all walks of life.  Some are terribly moving as the one by the widow of a  veteran asking for a referral.  Some are eye openers filled with hate that  are comical until one pauses to think of the consequences.  There are even  mundane letters such as the one from ex-president Buchanan asking for a set  of his history books to be returned.  In reading this book one can often be  transposed to a different era, a different mindset, and a different  century.  This is the grist mill of history.  I am so saddened that this  book is out of print.  Thank goodness I ordered my copy from Amazon.com  about 1.5 years ago.  If you can possibly get this volume somewhere grab  it.  Well worth your perusal.	2000-08-20

I am glad I bought this book.  There is nothing new here for the reader  well versed in the history of India.  However, the language and  presentation model is quite brisk and makes for a easy read.  The material  is fairly encompassing given that the purpose of the book is for the  general reader.  I found the narrative both interesting and fast moving.  A  good start for someone desiring to know present day India.	2000-08-19

This is an excellent book on showing the strength and character of Robert E. Lee.  I found the writing to be outstanding and the leadership theme  expounded very cogently.  This book shows how even men of character and  leadership flounder and make tragic mistakes.  What bothers me is there was  not enough emphasis on why, oh why, did a man like Lee accept the  abomination of slavery.  There were many other leaders who not only found  slavery a tragic sin but indeed supported the abolitionists.  Why did Lee  not do this?  What made a good and decent man not a GREAT man?  Crocker  does not answer these questions in his book.	2000-08-17

This book shows how biochemistry courses can be made interesting and  pertinent.  I love the clinical symptoms and diagnoses boxes. Various  biochemical processes are made relevant by linking them to symptoms and  diagnoses.  Remember in college when biochemistry was essentially a  memorization exercise?  Not so here.  I am not a doctor or med student but  I do have 24 hours of bio and take it from me this is a unique biochemistry  text.  The layout and design of the contents is very good.  Well worth the  price and deserving of shelf space in your library.	2000-08-15

This book serves as an excellent bridge for a mainframe programmer to  learn JAVA basics and Object Oriented concepts.  The chapters are succinct  and filled with real world examples (not &quot;hello Java&quot; nonsense).  Chapters 2 and 3 are just terrific.  My favorite is the chapter on JAVA  Structure (Chapter 3).  The font is nice and legible for us over 50 and  page layouts are easy on the eye.  The examples are pertinent and do not  talk down to you.  The authors give line by line explations of coding  examples and build upon them until towards the end of the book there is a  realistic application.  This is a great book if you want to get up to speed  in JAVA.  A word of caution. This book is just an introduction.  Advanced  JAVA concepts like SWING are not discussed.  After absorbing this book go  with the O'Reilly series:  JAVA In A Nutshell and JAVA Examples In A  Nutshell.	2000-08-15

What a delight and previlige to listen in on a master at work.  My physics  is now quite rusty (after 32 years !); but Dr. Feynman's cogent  explanations sure whet the appetite.  After a first hearing I replay the  CDs while browsing through the book.  This really brings home the point.  I  truly believe that this set should be required reading and listening for  high school seniors and/or first year undergraduates.  What a classic !!  Just buy it and enjoy...	2000-08-15

This book is truly a masterpiece.  The writing and layout is good.  Descriptions and illustrations are clear and well done.  I am not a medical professional and yet I find this book fascinating in its breadth and scope.  To better comprehend some of the anatomical structures I first read  relevant portions of this book and then go to Netter's Atlas Of Human  Anatomy.  One point of caution though - get the 38th British Edition.  This  is by far superior to the American Edition which costs half as much.  The  extra money spent will be well worth it.  After all there is a lifetime of  adventure embedded in this volume.	1999-12-07
