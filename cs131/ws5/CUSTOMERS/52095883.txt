US	52095883	R1VOS7TCQDWAYI	1556592019	897385256	Delights & Shadows	Books	4	62	70	N	N	Kooser's More Than Meets The Eye	So much is made of Ted Kooser's talent for exposing the extraordinary within the mundane that it is a wonder he hasn't become poetry's equivalent to a typecast Molly Ringwald, fleeing to Paris for a new identity. We hear from Poetry magazine that Kooser \\"documents . . . daily life\\"; from a description on his latest book's back cover that he \\"reveals the remarkable within an otherwise ordinary world\\" and from his friend Jim Harrison, who remarks on Kooser's \\"genius\\" for - surprise! - \\"making the ordinary sacramental.\\"<br /><br />Such constant praising of this narrow aspect of Kooser's wider achievement turns it into a kind of shtick, like Philip Levine's factory smoke. It is characteristically American to exploit any decently popular cultural marvel into something so familiar that its most visible representatives grace every cereal box and billboard from Seattle to Key West. I am not betting that Kooser will be the next spokesman for Wheaties - the days of Robinson Jeffers appearing on the cover of Time magazine are long behind us - but I am daring to suggest that there is more to Kooser's work than sacramental mason jars.<br /><br />Sure, Kooser doesn't exactly help things with titles such as \\"Cosmetics Department,\\" \\"A Jar of Buttons\\" and the exhilarating \\"A Spiral Notebook\\" (I wonder what that one's about?) but perhaps he is content with his given status as Hero of the Daily World. That's fine; who wouldn't be? In Delights and Shadows, however, I see more. I see that what Kooser does is less significant than how he does it; that amid such elusive simplicity as these poems command are more complicated emotions, the secret stories of well-lived lives, and a poet behind the scenes who understand exactly what buttons to push to let the reader into them.<br /><br />Kooser's poems reveal a mastery of gesture and detail that rivals the flawlessness of James Wright's \\"A Blessing.\\" Simple gestures in poems such as \\"At the Cancer Clinic\\" or the gorgeous \\"Gyroscope\\" raise the work to a level of sensuousness that is nothing short of hypnotizing. The plainest verbs capture the most vivid and lively scenes. In \\"At the Cancer Clinic,\\" two women help their sister through the clinic doors, and \\"Each bends to the weight of an arm / and steps with the straight, tough bearing / of courage.\\" In \\"Gyroscope,\\" we hear rumors of \\"the world beyond / the windows slowly tipping forward / into spring.\\"<br /><br />Even more captivating is Kooser's patient, exact description; how he pauses at every detail to ensure that it is brought to such life as to exist at the edge of the reader's fingertips, as in the description of a painting in \\"At the County Museum\\":<br /><br />Blacker than black, the lacquered horse-drawn hearse,<br />Dancing with stars from the overhead lights,<br /><br />Has clattered to a stop, but its waxy panels<br />Are dusted each morning, as if it might be summoned<br /><br />Back into harness, to be hauled once again<br />Through the wake of matched horses, the sweep<br /><br />Of their tails, its oak spokes soberly walking,<br />Each placed squarely in front of the next<br /><br />Along pinstriped rims that carefully unreeled<br />Hard ruts the wheels could follow home.<br /><br />Kooser's new book includes many of these museum visits, reports of paintings that are as vibrant as Mary Cassatt's box of pastels, so vivid and precise as to step inside the paintings themselves. Kooser's knack for poems on painting comes full circle in a delicate series of poems called \\"Four Civil War Paintings by Winslow Homer,\\" poems that occasionally indulge in the irresistible temptation to write poems about writing poems. \\"Some part of art is the art / of waiting,\\" the speaker reflects in \\"Sharpshooter,\\" \\"the chord / behind the tight fence / of a musical staff, / the sonnet shut in a book.\\" The best in the series, \\"The Veteran in a New Field,\\" underscores what power Kooser commands when he allows verbs to speak for themselves:<br /><br />His back is turned to us, his white shirt<br />the brightest thing in the painting.<br />Old trousers, leather army suspenders.<br />Before him the red wheat bends,<br />the sky is cloudless, smokeless, and blue.<br />Where he has passed, the hot stalks spread<br />in streaks, like a shell exploding, but that is<br />behind him. With stiff, bony shoulders<br />he mows his way into the colors of summer.<br /><br />For the most part, Kooser's poems are short, tightly wrapped things, as though gushing towards a final reflection from the poem's very first word. Such weight is placed on these concluding observations in which Kooser wraps so many poems that they occasionally buckle under the pressure and risk mawkishness. That a student crawling \\"out of the froth / of a hangover and onto the sand of the future\\" is \\"heavy with hope\\" seems less certain than the \\"length of common grocery twine / upon which smoothly spins and leans / one of the smaller worlds we each / at one time learn to master, the last / to balance so lightly in our hands.\\"<br /><br />An element of believability is lost in these otherwise persuasive poems when Kooser fuses his final lines with so much of the poem's burden. Like most omniscient narrators, the one reporting on the lives of the people and places in these poems imposes on the subject at times: suggestions that an older man whose flabby arm exposes the faded tattoo of former lives has \\"a heart gone soft and blue with stories,\\" for instance, or \\"all the shuffling magazines\\" that \\"grow still\\" because the speaker commands \\"Grace\\" to fill \\"the clean mold of this moment\\" at the cancer clinic.<br /><br />Yet Kooser's understated style manages to overpower this tendency toward the melodramatic or his adoration of such poeticized words as \\"shadow\\" and \\"dust.\\" Though Kooser overreaches for affect at times, at least he waits until the final few lines that conclude a sustained series of perfectly chosen verbs from his spare lexicon of awe, a vocabulary restrained enough to allow readers the necessary participation. Like Denise Levertov or Nazim Hikmet, there is often a playful sense of wonder at the human experience that sets these poems apart from the more self-conscious work produced by many of his contemporaries.<br /><br />Even more than Kooser's overexposed talent for rending the miraculous from the mundane is this success at considering something larger than the self or its immediate experiences. Plenty of poets have managed to make poetry out of ordinary things, and while Kooser may be one of the best, what really sets him apart is this ability to look outward with an eye perceptive enough to see where the stories are, like some extraterrestrial assigned to report on earthly life to the inhabitants of another planet.<br /><br />[...]fore him the red wheat bends,  the sky is cloudless, smokeless, and blue.

US	52095883	R2CK5J44R433O7	1559721308	536858862	JFK: The Cia, Vietnam, and the Plot to Assassinate John F. Kennedy	Books	4	197	205	N	N	An Admirble Attempt at Truth-telling by a Good Man	If you have come to this book looking for another lean, persuasive investigation of the various conspiracies that could have led to the killing of JFK, you have come to the wrong place. prouty's book reaches far wider than that narrow scope, exploring every square inch of his vast, first-hand knowledge of the workings and consequences of the so-called Cold War (though I don't see how the bloody loss of millions of lives during that time constitute a war that was anything but blazing hot).<br /><br />Prouty, a former Air Force colonel and CIA insider, manages to observe his life's work from an objective standpoint that raises countless probing and often hair-raising questions and warnings. Reaching back to the origins of the cold war and its effects on the policy and history that would soon be made, Prouty paints an expansive, thorough and detailed account not only of the JFK assassination, but of the entire political and industrial framework festering in the 20 years leading up to that moment that allowed such a tragedy to take place.<br /><br />Contrary to most other books that deal --either obliquely or directly -- with JFK's murder, prouty's endures with a relevance that has as much to say about our own time as it does about Kennedy's. He foresees all the problems of a tyrannically powerful CIA that functions as the President's puppet master. \\"Many of the skilled saboteurs and terrorists of today are CIA students of yesterday,\\" Prouty asserts in what amounts to an astonishing revelation when one considers that, among others, Osama Bin Laden is one of those \\"CIA students of yesterday.\\" But it isn't only terrorists: it is the people we put in place as American puppets around the world. Take Hamad Karzai, for example, former CIA agent and millionaire now serving as President of Afghanistan.<br /><br />The intimate and omnipotent mingling of money, military, covert intelligence operations and politics is precisely the network of power Prouty implicates not only in the crime that was the JFK murder, but the crime of so many brutal wars and coups performed by the CIA throughout the world to this very day. We are under the tyranny of an intelligence elite, an elite that happens to have the most powerful military and political machines on the planet at its service.<br /><br />As prouty shows, Truman regretted his approval of the formation of the CIA toward the end of his presidency. Eisenhower tried to curb its powers but failed miserably, and when Kennedy fired Allen Dulles -- CIA chief at the time -- and not only threatened but actually worked to break the CIA \\"into a thousand pieces,\\" he was killed. If that strieks you as an irrational logical leap, you need to read Prouty's book.<br /><br />It is admirable that he undertook the writing of the book himself, rather than resorting to the services of some professional writer as so many politicians and military officials do for their memoirs and other books. Consequently, Prouty's book suffers a bit from a lack of the kind of polish it might have had. He struggles to organize his vast knowledge into the kind of coherant narrative he envisions and promises to no avail throughout. The reader has to work a little harder here to put the many pieces together that prouty lays out.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Prouty's book reads like a desperate, angry and even frantic attempt at telling the truth by a man whose writing voice belies a remarkable warmth and sincerity. He knows so much and is so appalled at the hypocrisy he witnessed throughout his career -- hypocrisy that turned to horror -- that his book reads like the result of a minor god angrily shaking his fists and roaring in a locked room. His background, littered with merits and accolades, backs up every claim he makes here.<br /><br />Prouty's book is entirely based on first-hand knowledge and expertise he gleaned over the course of a distinguished career: the precarious security arrangements in Dallas that day, Kennedy's advocacy of aUS note that would compete with the federal note, his vow to remove all troops from Vietnam by 1965 and how this threatened the money-making machine that was the Vietnam \\"conflict,\\" the utter astonishment in Washington at Kennedy's victory over Nixon, a man for whom various war and intelligence initiatives had already been drawn up for him to sign off on at the start of his presidency -- before he was even elected!<br /><br />From its first hour, Kennedy's thousand-day presidency threatened so many established powers, so many benefactors of the military industrial complex, that there was no way it could have ended up otherwise. Even Robert McNamara, a great admirer of the president and godfather to one of Bobby Kennedy's kids, understood that a helicopter-augmented war like Vietnam would \\"churn out big dollars,\\" that the war itself was capable of creating the $500 billion in military-industrial profits it eventually raised. Any former Ford executive understands the profits inherent in the collusion between military and industry.<br /><br />As Prouty reports, quoting the controversial novel \\"Report From iron Mountain,\\" \\"The war system is indispensable to the stable political structure . . . war provides the sense of external necessity without which no government can long remain in power.\\" This is precisely the bleak \\"necessity\\" that Kennedy eventually grew to rebuke, and it was that rebuke that put the nails in his coffin long before his trip to Dallas.<br /><br />Visit my blog at [...], his vow to remove all troops from Vietnam by 1965 and how this threatened the money-making machine that was the Vietnam \\"conflict,\\" the utter astonishment in Washington at Kennedy's victory over Nixon, a man for whom various war and intelligence initiatives had already been drawn up for him to sign off on at the start of his presidency -- before he was even elected!

US	52095883	R23MD33ATVL7LC	1565849426	231333150	The Assassination Of Julius Caesar: A People's History Of Ancient Rome (New Press People's History)	Books	5	56	66	N	N	Sincere and Heartbreaking Historical Document	Critics who fail to see through the very blindnesses Parenti challenges throughout this book are just proving his point. It is not, as \\"L.C\\" Robinson asserts above, that Parenti thinks everybody is wrong. Parenti's interest is not in some puerile (and typically American) debate over who is right and who is wrong, but rather a very fair and disinterested discussion about the consequences of crippling class stratification in ancient Rome and, as it turns out, throughout much of the history that followed.<br /><br />People like Mr. Robinson speak from precisely the privileged perspective Parenti works so tirelessly to challenge here. It is unfathomable to people such as himself that there are those for whom education is a pipe dream, an unattainable aspiration prohibited by the financial situations into which they were born. From the days of Sallust, Seutonius and Polybius on down to Edward Gibbon, education was a privilege reserved for the wealthy. Literacy rates in ancient Rome were horrific; the vast majority of the population could neither read nor write. This insurmountable disadvantage persisted over thousands of years and continues even today, when there are only two ways by which an American kid gets a good education: rich parents, or a willingness to plunge oneself into tens of thousands of dollars into debt (I myself owe $57,000 in student loans, which will not be paid off for 30 years). In less developed nations, literacy rates remain as bad as they were in Caligula's day. Still, though, America's own literacy rate ranks just 48th in the world (see Morris Berman's \\"Twilight of American Culture\\"). Of course, some of us are lucky enough to land a scholarship or grant, but that is too often like winning the lottery.<br /><br />People like Seutonius and Edward Gibbon were able to write history because they could afford to; they grew up in the upper classes where education was not only affordable but often taken for granted. Parenti's thesis is absolutely correct: history is written by the winners, the privileged and the fortunate. Thus, the condemnation of the ancient Roman populace as an unwashed and filthy rabble persists not because it is fact, but because it is the only history that circumstances have allowed. It is one of history's most glaring ironies that the privileged classes of ancient Rome considered themselves morally superior to plebs and slaves, when it was THEY who orchestrated spectacles such as this one, described so poignantly by Parenti:<br /><br />\\"The ceremonies to dedicate Pompey's theater included a battle between a score of elephants and men armed with javelins . . . the slaughter of the elephants proved more than the crowd could countenance. One giant creature, brought to its knees by missiles, crawled about, ripping shields from its attackers and throwing them into the air. Another, pierced deeply through the eyes with a javelin, fell dead with a horrifying crash. The elephants shrieked bitterly as their tormentors closed in. Some of them refused to fight, treading about frantically with trunks raised toward Heaven, as if lamenting to the gods. In desperation, the beleaguered beasts tried to break through the iron palisade that corralled them. When they had lost all hope of escape, they turned to the spectators as if to beg for their assistance with heartbreaking gestures of entreaty, deploring their fate with a sort of wailing . . . the audience was overcome by a feeling that these great mammals had something in common with humankind.\\"<br /><br />It was the plebs whose eyes could not bear what they saw; the senators and kings who forced it upon them, calculating these events specifically to distract the underprivileged from the practical woes that Caesar and the Gracchi (among others) attempted to ease with proposals for reform that culminated in so many assassinations at the hands of Roman society's chief beneficiaries. In the face of so many biased and classist historical texts, Parenti's bookis as necessary an historical account of an extraordinary epoch as we have. While casting Caesar in a more humane and progressive light than historians have allowed, Parenti never wavers in his sincerity, calling attention to Caesar's notorious brutality and the corruption that festered around him as much as he lauds the man's more civil pursuits. Parenti never claims that Caesar hoped for an egalitarian society; he only suggests that Caesar's proposals for reforms in land distribution, tax codes and interest rates provoked the bitter disdain of the rich and powerful.<br /><br />Compared to the quality of life available to plebs and slaves, these proposals were modest, even meager, compared to the real needs of ancient Rome's common people. Still, they might have lent some degree of comfort to the lives of those who had to use the urine of passersby to wash their clothes (As parenti explains, uric acid is still used today in common cleaning agents such as Borax) and crammed into unstable and claustrophobic apartment complexes, living with five other families in one room. That even these most modest of attempts at pacifying the underprivileged met with such scorn from Cicero, Marcus Brutus, Cassius and others makes an even more powerful testament of Parenti's book, which never turns a blind eye to Caesar's entire character merely to prove a point. This is the kind of sincerity and humanity one would expect from historians but so infrequently experiences.<br /><br />[...]l account of an extraordinary epoch as we have.

That the book teems with the ferocity, distinctiveness and wisdom of an American literary classic is beyond the expectations of even some of his most devoted students. That word \\"student\\" becomes especially appropriate as the first volume of Dylan's memoirs unfolds with a litany of literary allusions, historical references and insight, and an amount of experience reserved for ten lifetimes. While some of that may not necessarily be unexpected, the vividness of Dylan's many character studies, the precision and clarity of his illuminating bursts of historical reflections, and the breadth of his rich reading experience, make for a life whose unique fullness is only partially revealed in the man's music. As with any autobiography, Dylan conveniently selects the fragments of his life he is willing to discuss. His tumultuous early relationships with Suze Rotolo and Joan Baez, for example, are quickly shrugged off, while even less is said of Dylan's most lauded works, from all those classic early songs to Blood on the Tracks and beyond. Similarly, the book itself is arranged into a series of prolonged recollections that jump over whole decades and retreat back again, avoiding the kind of linear narrative one might expect of a memoir. But from a man who infuriates as easily as he satisfies, such idiosyncrasy is hardly surprising. It is in the few windows of his life through which Dylan chooses to gaze that the book's intensity explodes. From an extended examination of the sessions that led to 1989's Oh Mercy to a vulnerable look at the disillusionment that nearly derailed his creative and personal life, Dylan's candor leaves little to the imagination. Most appealing of all is his ability to maintain throughout the book a sense of something larger than himself, a modesty that makes for a particularly refreshing and fascinating read. Some of the best parts of the book have nothing to do with the man himself, and read like stretches of lost prose from some of the many literary masters to which he so frequently alludes. At turns a great American road novel, landmark historical document and professorial lecture, Chronicles, Vol. 1 is as colorful an addition to American letters as Woody Guthrie's Bound for Glory or Kerouac's On the Road.<br /><br />Visit my blog at [...]book have nothing to do with the man himself, and read like stretches of lost prose from some of the many literary masters to which he so frequently alludes.

Though the book tends to race through Alexander's life at the expense of further detail, it is still a more patient account than other recent biographies rushed to stores in time for the movie. From his mounting of Philip II's incorrigible horse as a boy to his legendary pursuit of Darius throughout Persia and subsequent endeavor to avenge his murder (only because Alexander would have liked the honor of killing Darius himself), every quirk and rumor of Alexander's personality is explored here. It is hard to say anything necessarily \\"new\\" when no new sources of information exist beyond those of contemporary historians who continue to interpret the documents of the same handful of ancient writers: Curtius, Justin, Diodorus, Plutarch and others. When a chairman of the Department of History at Wesleyan University with a Ph.D. from Princeton tosses yet another biography into the fray, it is usually an attempt to dispute the conclusions of other biographers. Rogers does plenty of that here. Downplaying accounts of Alexander's homosexuality while attempting to understand his bloody rampages across the known world within the context of his times, Rogers objects to notions of Alexander as the Hitler or Stalin of the ancient world, often pointing to the equally brutal tactics of the king's contemporaries. Admittedly, Rogers tends to apologize for Alexander's brutality where he really ought to leave it up to the reader to decide. An ability to let the facts speak for themselves is what makes Peter Green's Alexander of Macedon the preeminent contemporary study of Alexander. But if Rogers's book lacks the authority of a less-enamored chronicle, it makes up for this flaw with its informed eloquence. Rogers has given us a book flooding over with the warm and knowledgeable passion of a scholar who loves his job as much as he loves his subject. If that is a \\"flaw,\\" I sure wouldn't mind being accused of it myself.<br /><br />[...]a book flooding over with the warm and knowledgeable passion of a scholar who loves his job as much as he loves his subject.

The opportunity to see a distinct American epoch through the eyes of a Charles Dickens is one that I lusted after. Yet, as Goldman and Whitley's introduction to the Penguin edition rightly observes, the book is \\"extremely disappointing in its omissions and pervasive flatness.\\" That \\"flatness\\" ought to have concerned me upon first reading the title. \\"American Notes for General Circulation\\" is hardly an inviting description of what's inside. Not one to judge a book by its cover, though, I dismissed this minor oversight and dove in. However, while Whitley and Goldman go on to suggest that \\"American Notes\\" is somehow \\"fascinating as a record of the ways in which the foremost creative writer of his day responded to the most exciting social experiment of his time,\\" that \\"fascination\\" is merely superficial and fails to last beyond the book's mildly humorous opening scenes of a sea journey to Boston.<br /><br />The book's problems are its redundancy and timidity. Dickens seems to be exclusively interested in reporting on every hospital and prison in America, which he does for at least the first third of the book. While some of his descriptions and observations in this portion of the narrative reveal the character of one of literary history's most compassionate figures, this too grows stale as Dickens fails to overcome his peculiar infatuation and look beyond. Even when he does move on, in DC, Cincinatti and elsewhere, some of the most controversial issues of his day -- slavery, Native American negotiations with the US government -- are mentioned only fleetingly as Dickens turns increasingly inward and elaborates for many pages on the most forgettable and mundane experiences common to any journey or vacation, whether it be a cruise through the Caribbean in 2004 or a trip on a riverboat up the Mississippi in 19th-century America, a river that meets with Dickens's intense disdain.<br /><br />Some of Dickens's observations on the functions and implications of the American democratic system as well as generalizations on the  mannerisms of Americans go far to show how little has changed since Dickens came to Boston in 1842, but rarely rise to the lyrical intensity or vivid portraits one would expect from a powerhouse such as Charles Dickens. The letters included in this edition demonstrate just how much Dickens held back in the writing of the book, which leads me to wonder just why people like Washington Irving found it so objectionable as to never speak to Dickens again. Surely the book offers some less-than-flattering ruminations on the people and corruption surrounding him, but had Dickens's book reflected the more aggressive tone of his letters, \\"American Notes\\" may have been as much of a classic today as it might have been an unconscionable offence to Irving or the American journalists who panned it at the time.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book is incapable of engenering much more than the relatively tame emotional response it received upon its release, and if its sales were impressive (which they were), this was due chiefly to the author's name and not to anything that is said between the front and back cover. Whitley and Goldman make the excellent point that some of Dickens's high-profile American friends -- Longfellow, for one -- may have influenced his impressions to such an extent that they diluted the final product. This is a case in which Dickens's fame hindered the sincerity of his work. For a more entertaining and memorable reading experience, try Parkman's \\"Oregon Trail,\\" Steinbeck's \\"Travels With Charley\\" or Least-Heat Moon's \\"Blue Highways\\". For a great travel-read from a time and place far beyond 19th or 20th-century America, try Marco Polo's truly \\"fascinating\\" \\"Travels\\"..

On a somewhat superficial level, Polo's book is a must read for lovers of travel or adventure stories, as it reads like a great lost book of the Bible, rife with historic vengeance, heroic warriors, eccentric mystics, penultimate battles and rallying speeches that seem torn out of the best passages of Thucydides. Many of the practices and beliefs Polo witnessed -- specifically, polygamous peoples, perspectives on sexuality, methods of execution and the dazzling ways in which the people Polo came across attempted to please the gods and interpret the cosmos -- offer a memorable glimpse into a unique historical epoch. Particularly engrossing are the stories of violent tensions between Christian and Islamic sects in Polo's day and region. One gets a sense that not much has changed in the past 800 years as Polo details the struggles between the eastern and western world even then, many of which redound to financial issues (sound familiar?). Polo's insistence on portraying Moslems and Buddhists as savage rogues does make for a one-dimensional and distinctly Christian view of the world as it was in Polo's day, and his language is hardly the most attractive aspect of the book, which is written in a particularly conversational and redundant style. But the stories and characters contained within these pages are epic and unforgettable. I encourage lovers of Tolkein, C.S. Lewis and Rowling to read this book. Lovers of ancient history and philosophy are also bound to adore it. Most impressively, though, is the insight Polo offers into the birth of the now-infamous rift between the western and eastern worlds. This enduring relevance guarantees that we will be reading Polo's \\"Travels\\" for centuries to come.	2004-11-03

I think of Cavafy, C.K. Williams, Philip Larkin, Horace -- masters of the craft gifted with the knack for discovering scraps of truth within the simplest words. \\"You might as well be a clown/big silly clothes, no evidence of desire,\\" Dunn suggests in the book's opening poem. This is the language that gets you clawing through the pages to get to the lines that know you, that approve of some private cowardice or failure you wouldn't dare confess even to the closest friend.<br /><br />But there is a kind of trust Dunn builds with the reader here, a wisdom so simple yet complicated enough that you could not quite have put your finger on it as quickly or accurately as he. I mean how his poems know that \\"as we fall in love/we are already falling out of it.\\" How they resist self-pity in the face of fate: \\"Because in my family the heart goes first/and hardly anybody makes it out of his fifties/I think I'll stay up late with a few bandits of my choice and resist good advice.\\" It is the sort of statement that gets me flying out of my chair pumping my fist as though I'm cherring on the home team at a high school football game. I am happy for the speaker of these poems the way I was happy for Hulk Hogan as a kid. Dave Smith writes that Dunn may not be correct, but he is never wrong. Mr. Smith, himself a phenomenal and overlooked American poet, is exactly right: Dunn's voice is unafraid, skeptical, warm, consoling, bitter, celebratory and -- most of all -- accurate.<br /><br />Books like \\"Different Hours\\" become \\"tombstones on our lives\\" as James Merrill says of love. I know that is true of my own experience with it. I was in a Virgin Records, still reeling from an atrocious break-up whose pain refused to leave me. The book collection upstairs was as miserable as I was at the moment; shelves so poorly stacked that it seemed the store was about to do away with selling books altogether. But then a dark and vibrant cover caught my eye; a book by someone named Stephen Dunn whom I had not only never heard of but who also happened to have won the Pulitzer. In the terrible frame of mine I was in that afternoon, I needed nothing more than to listen to what these poems had to say:<br /><br />Those Trotskys of relationships,<br />perpetual revolution their motto,<br />their impatient hearts<br />dangerous to all that's complacent,<br /><br />I understand them perfectly<br />and also why someone they've left behind<br />might travel all the way to Mexico<br />with a pickaxe to put an end to things.<br /><br />Coming across these poems for the first time, it felt as though they were spoken from somewhere inside of me, scratched into my skin; lines that were extended hands strong enough to pull me out of the dark. If angels are not physical presences, then they are actions. They are moments like these in which you hear your name called from a poorly stocked bookshelf in a record store and stumble upon the road that takes you to who you are. Though I am no longer a captive of the bitter junkyard that was my heart at that time, I have never stopped enjoying these poems. I read over \\"Different Hours\\" as well as Dunn's \\"Loosestrife\\" and \\"Selected Poems\\" to this day. Taken as a whole, Dunn's work is one of the most reliable and compassionate friends I have ever had.book by someone named Stephen Dunn whom I had not only never heard of but who also happened to have won the Pulitzer.

As fascinating to the Dickinson scholar as they are to the casual enthusiast, Dickinson's letters -- along with those of Keats or Hopkins -- prove that this is every bit as legitimate a genre as fiction or poetry. Some of Dickinson's most gorgeous and enduring statements are here, and to read these in chronological order is to map the gradual development of America's premier woman poet. Even in a letter she wrote at 12-years-old, the idiosyncratic dashes with which she distinguished her poetic voice are abundant, and already have that effect of forcing the reader to savor clusters of words as they unravel down the page. Similarly, Dickinson's mind-blowing instinct for the staggering metaphor is in full gear throughout (\\"Vinnie came soft as a moccasin\\") and, for all her great death poetry, it is in a letter regarding the death of her father where we find perhaps her most vulnerable and moving confrontation with mortality:<br /><br />\\"Father does not live with us now -- he lives in a new house. Though it was built in an hour it is better than this. He hasn't any garden because he moved after gardens were made, so we take him the best flowers, and if we only knew he knew, perhaps we could stop crying.\\"<br /><br />Perhaps most fascinating of all, though, is the mixture of extremes Dickinson's personality manifests throughout these letters, a crude bluntness that mingles with the most tender innocence. She at once condemns a cousin's valentine as \\"A little condescending, & sarcastic, your Valentine to me, I thought\\" and begins another missive with the exuberant mysticism of a child speaking as if out of some fairytale: \\"I wanted to write, and just tell you that me, and my spirit were fighting this morning. It isn't known generally, and you musn't tell anybody.\\" Of course, this book also includes that characteristically bizarre and unforgettable final letter, which she wrote while suffering from the illness that would take her life just days later: \\"Little Cousins, Called Back. Emily.\\" Especially enjoyable about this particular volume are the endnotes with which the editor follows up most letters. These brief but informed observations offer a fascinating and thorough glimpse into Dickinson's reading life, while also helping to illuminate her more obscure autobiographical allusions. This book is as fascinating an odyssey as Dickinson's complete poems, and I think readers do themselves a great service by delving into these letters alongside that more celebrated aspect of her genius.e wrote while suffering from the illness that would take her life just days later: \\"Little Cousins, Called Back.

Additionally, the book's story depends on wholly improbably human situations, discomforting sexual bizarreness, and characters whose words and behavior reflect a cruelty that ultimately rings untrue. For all its flaws, though, the novel does contain its handful of classic passages, the best of which features Eddie's explanation for his sexual interest in elderly women:<br /><br />\\"I try to see the whole woman,\\" Eddie Said to Hannah. \\"Of course I recognize that she's old, but there are photographs -- or the equivalent of photographs in one's imagination of anyone's life. A whole life, I mean. I can picture her when she was much younger than I am -- because there are always gestures and expressions that are ingrained, ageless. An old woman doesn't have to see herself as an old woman, and neither do I. I try to see the whole life in her. There's something so moving about someone's whole life.\\"<br /><br />But these charming and lyrically powerful bursts of prose did little to cure my bewilderment at knowing that Irving spent four years working on this novel, routinely journeying to Amsterdam to research various places and characters, and after all that, ends up with believable characters who do completely unbelievable things. Particularly, Harry, the street cop of Amsterdam, ends up falling in love with Ruth, the novel's hero, going to Paris with her, moving to the states and agreeing to marry her ALL WITHIN WEEKS OF MEETING THE WOMAN.<br /><br />Similarly, another customer reviewer below named Rebecca has her finger on the problem when she suggests that the novel expects its readers to accept the nonchalance with which Marion, Ruth's mother, copes with the loss of her sons by having a sexual affair with a 16-year-old boy because he looked like one of her dead sons. Huh? These incestuous implications compounded by Eddie's interest in sleeping with women who are in their 70s and 80s reveal a rather peculiar moralization of sexual intercourse (despite Eddie's eloquent explanation).<br /><br />Equally distracting is Irving's apparent conviction that compelling dialogue must include an inordinate spewing of obscenities. At times, Ruth and Hannah are so incorrigibly and inexplicably foul-mouthed that they morph together into the same implausible character, echoing that generic postmodern sarcasm that makes it so impossible to distinguish between the characters of Delillo or even, at times but for different reasons, Virginia Woolf.<br /><br />I also applaud Rebecca for pointing out how crudely Irving has us accept that Ted Cole, a man whose self-indulgence is an incurable destructive force in the lives of everyone around him (including his daughter), suddenly decides to leap all the way to the other side of the emotional spectrum, tormented by such compulsion over the consequences of his promiscuity in his daughter's life that he kills himself? Please. Irving ought to have spent more time developing these jagged dramatic devices rather than embellishing for page after tedious page on such wholly uninteresting events as Ruth's book-signings or Harry's innocuous interest in the prostitutes of Amsterdam.<br /><br />What saves this book is Irving's powerful and subtle sense of humor as well as the novel's occasional flares of wisdom and warmth. Similarly rewarding is the taut suspense Irving builds throughout the novel as Marion's anticipated return to her daughter after having left her life for 37-years slowly comes about. It is here that Irving's novel is worthy of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, whose \\"Love in a Time of Cholera\\" unravels a tale of love so deeply ingrained in the heart that it endures half a century of separation, bringing the couple together again and, sexually, for the very first time. Predictably, Marquez manages Irving's ownplot with more tact and patience, and I would easily recommend giving Marquez's book a look before \\"Widow For One Year.\\"d easily recommend giving Marquez's book a look before \\"Widow For One Year.\\"	2004-08-07

From the beautiful but intellectually minor Buddenbrooks to this impeccable piece of fiction, Thomas Mann grew as a thinker with staggering rapidity and thoroughness. The book reads like a bottomless bag of delicious morsels: no matter how many you pop in your mouth at one time, you never seem to get to the last one. &quot;What a piece of work man is,&quot; Mann observes, &quot;and how easily conscience betrays him. He listens to the voice of duty, and what he hears is the license of passion.&quot; The book teems with passages such as this, whose inarguable truth and sincerity transcends traditional value judgements. Northrop Frye writes that art is neither good nor bad, true nor false. That certainly applies to this book. If we are to believe that the great poem should not mean but be, then Mann's book is just as immortal a poem as it is a novel. But equally as delightful as its language and ideas (excitingly rendered into English by John E. Woods) are the book's actions and characters, which are drawn so vividly you could almost touch their faces, hear them breathing, dwell in their hearts until the book's final word. And the action: who would not want to take a ride up to that hermetic but wildly sociable world of the Swiss Alps sanatorium, which seethes with the lust and intellectual vigor of of an ancient Greek tragedy? The cast of individuals Hans Castorp meets during his stay there are unforgettable, and the dramatic pitch of their many quarrels and parties is indeed nothing short of &quot;magic.&quot; This is a world you fall in love with and would die to step into. If any single passage in all of Mann's work won him the Nobel, it is the one this book concludes with: the matured and resolved Hans Castorp blending into the violent human sea of the battlefield in what would become World War I, that epic nightmare which Mann predicts with alarming detail and precision. Ultimately, I think this is a book about being human, one of the select few that do not settle for examining a particular aspect of the human experience, but the entire scope of it all. It is a book for everyone: the lonely, the loved, and the lost.ing detail and precision.

Lucid, informed and methodical, Bloom's &quot;Blake's Apocalypse&quot; leaves no page unturned amid his exhaustive investigation into the influences, ideas and hopes that comprise Blake's vast and complicated &quot;poetic argument.&quot; Though Bloom's erudition can sometimes undermine his clarity, the book glows with the confident understanding and purpose he built his name on. Delving into Blake's main influences -- Milton, the Bible and the ancient Greeks -- Bloom focuses much of his time on Blake's epics while making the good point that these greater works are often neglected in favor of the more managable and straightforward &quot;Songs of Innocence and Experience.&quot; &quot;Blake's Apocalypse&quot; is an endless resource comparable to those other masterpieces of Blake scholarship: Frye's &quot;Fearful Symmetry&quot; and Erdman's &quot;Prophet Against Empire.&quot; I've been relying on it for months now and can't imagine any session with Blake's mind being complete without it.	2004-07-28

Through much of his longer poetical works he so effortlessly associates his mammoth cosmic figures with a riveting and impassioned philosophical discourse. One wonders whether the man was even human. And yet it is precisely this disbelief he and, a bit later and with more severity, Nietzsche preached against.<br /><br /> For Blake, the human imagination is the gateway to eternity, and anyone is capable of it. Yet even this vote of confidence in man falls short of Nietzsche's often misunderstood optimism when he asserts that artistic achievement has nothing to do with the &quot;muse&quot; and is wholly within the boundaries of human ability. For Nietzsche, man alone responsible for his great works, and to credit anything else with their sublimity is to undermine human potential. But Blake, a man of profound faith, contends that &quot;When I am commanded by the spirits, then I write; and the moment I have written, I see the words fly about the room in all directions.&quot; Yet how telling it is that even this humble explaining-away of his powers is fraught with poetry.<br /><br /> But whether or not Blake credited himself with his evident genius, the works speak for themselves. And for &quot;The Complete Poetry and Prose,&quot; two of the most competent Blake scholars join forces to offer a clear, extensive and informed presentation of Blake's output. Astonishing in scope and scholarship, this Erdman/Bloom edition is as indispensable for Blake's work as it is for their notes and commentary. My only complaint is the inconsistency of Bloom's commentary. He skips entire sections of Blake's worth here, whereas he covers every last word of it in his own book, &quot;Blake's Apocalypse.&quot; Hmm . . . Harold wouldn't, by any chance, be trying to get us to, um, SPEND a little more, you think? Naaahhh.<br /><br /> But no commentary -- no matter how illuminating -- will ever approach the radiance of Blake's own words. From the plainspoken awe of the early masterpieces, &quot;Ahania&quot; and &quot;The Book of Thel,&quot; to the astonishing epics &quot;The Four Zoas&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem&quot; and right down to &quot;The Mental Traveler,&quot; that late fruition of Blake's bitingly ironical voice, &quot;The Complete Poems and Prose&quot; reads like a Bible in its own right. Routinely taking on such lofty subjects as the fall of man, love and jealousy, desire and reason, good and evil, a reading of Blake's work all together yields just as much beauty, mystery and genius.<br /><br /> Equally as riveting are the many letters with which the primary portion of the book concludes. Rife with the fierce inquisitiveness and confidence that characterizes the famous &quot;Proverbs of Hell,&quot; Blake's letters rank with those of Keats and Hopkins as some of the most stirring autobiographical sketches ever produced by a master poet.<br /><br /> Erdman's &quot;Prophet Against Empire&quot; and Bloom's aforementioned &quot;Blake's Apocalypse&quot; make for great companion pieces, as does Frye's &quot;Fearful Symmetry.&quot; But I think the best way for new readers to take on Blake's work is by diving blindly into its initially cold waters, and only calling in Erdman, Bloom and Frye to turn up the heat later on.r how illuminating -- will ever approach the radiance of Blake's own words.

He remains the only one of them all who actually got to talk to people who knew Blake, who were friends with he and his wife. Secondly, he was alert enough to recognize Blake's genius despite the neglect with which it continued to be treated even as Gilchrist wrote the book. Just as Harold Bloom suggests that Emerson proved his own genius by being the first to recognize Whitman's, the same ought to be said of Gilchrist. Throughout Gilchrist's account, he cites conversations and letters exchanged with various friends of Blake, from Samuel Palmer to Crabb Robinson and others. Palmer serves up a gorgeous and sensitive portrait of Blake in a letter to Gilchrist, while Gilchrist's copious quoting of Robinson's talks with Blake are ceaselessly fascinating.<br /><br /> To read this first of countless Blake biographies before one of the more recent ones is to strap yourself into a time machine and launch from one world to entirely another. Writing in the 1860s, Gilchrist's language reflects just how jaded we've become over time. Full of purple but no less delightful prose, Gilchrist's often adoring book stops at nothing to ensure the sanctity of his subject. One of Blake's early and comparatively minor \\"Song\\" poems from the \\"Poetical Sketches\\" is described as possessing \\"shy evanescent tints and aroma as of pressed rose-leaves.\\"<br /><br /> Yet for all the book's haughtiness, it is Gilchrist's fascinating renunciation of criticism that most distinguishes him from we post-moderns: \\"Criticism is idle. How analyze a violet's perfume, or dissect the bloom on a butterfly's wing?\\" It would be a long way to Freud, Brooks, Frye, Vendler and Bloom. While Gilchrist often goes to boring lengths in describing Blake's paintings and engravings (as in the tedious \\"Supplementary\\" chapter at the end), it is a good thing he did decide to lay off the criticism, as Gilchrist often reveals a complete and astonishing inability to fathom so much of Blake's work. He repeatedly surrenders to the abstractness of Blake's epics, condemning Jerusalem's language as \\"words empty of meaning to all but him who uttered them\\" and says of Blake's \\"Milton\\" that \\"few are the readers who will ever penetrate beyond the first page or two.\\"<br /><br /> But it is the book's charm that designates it a literary monument. \\"Fully to appreciate the poetry as the lad Blake composed in the years 1768-77. let us call to mind the dates at which first peeped above the horizon the cardinal lights which people our modern poetic heavens,\\" Gilchrist carries on at the book's onset. The author often blurs the line between eloquence and coherence early on, but soon, as if the immensity of Gilchrist's project gradually wore him down, the book assumes a far more pedestrian tone and becomes all the more wrenching a read because of it.<br /><br /> The book's most powerful moment comes in a chapter called \\"Personal Details\\" which, if you can sift through Gilchrist's romantic elaborations, makes for a singularly moving document of Blake, the man and the artist, including such meticulously vivid observations as to his clothes, the shape of his head and nose, the look in his eyes, the way he carried his five-foot-six frame. \\"his clothes were threadbare,\\" Gilchrist writes, \\"and his gray trousers had worn black and shiny in front, like a mechanic's.

Firstly, my 1995 copy crumbled into an oblivion of dry glue, a spine torn in half and a cover too flabby to endure. I did turn to the book often for information, but from the looks of it, you'd think I shot it out of a canon once a week as well. The book is just as cheaply constructed as other reviewers contend, while the Q Rock Stars Encyclopedia is much friendlier to the reader both aesthetically and physically. Secondly, Rolling Stone's web site used to contain all the information found in this book. Recently, though, the disappointing decision was made to scrap those lengthier and more informative biographies for the infuriatingly cursory headnotes they recently replaced them with.<br />Some of the omissions noted by other reviewers here are remarkable not necessarily because of the bands omitted, but because of the &quot;artists&quot; Rolling Stone replaced them with. I mean, come on, the guys in Great White aren't exactly pioneers, and why anyone thinks the exclusion of Wierd Al Yankovic is at all noteworthy mystifies me. But to leave them out for Britney Spears? Ricky Martin? What a blow! Couldn't we just scrap Milli Vanilli, for the love of God? It isn't as though Tiffany, who is included in this book, will be remembered any more than Britney 30 years from now; nonetheless I don't consider either pop star worthy of inclusion at the expense of decently talented blues bands such as Great White who at least know what a &quot;chord&quot; is. The real crime with regard to the debate over who's in and who's out is the exclusion of various Native American songwriters such as Jim Boyd or Bill Miller. The former in particular continues to make unbelievable folk rock (some of which was featured on the &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; Soundtrack). The work Boyd has done with Sherman Alexie (songs like the incomparable &quot;Million Miles Away&quot;) especially warrants recognition here.<br />Those objections aside, this really is a nearly inexhaustible resource for fans of any of the 1,900+ bands the book takes a look at. I think that the distant tone with which the entries are written will infuriate more passionate fans who think their heroes aren't getting the accolades they deserve. But as an Encyclopedia's duty is to provide the essential information, this book at least succeeds more often than it fails. My own relationship with its past and current editions is going on about 8 years now. Along with the &quot;Rough Guide to Rock&quot; or the &quot;Encyclopedia of Record Producers,&quot; it continues to be one of the few resources I run to for answers to questions or quick tutorials on bands whose work I am yet to be familiar with. I think it should also be noted that people ought not to be mislead by the &quot;Rock 'N Roll&quot; title, as the book includes many bluegrass, country, and folk artists who may not immediately be associated with Rock 'N Roll per say, but who influenced the genre to such an extent that their exclusion from this book would have been egregious.

Ackroyd seems more interested in toning down the embellishments of a 150-year-old biography (Gilchrist's) than telling a good story, when it has long been understood that Gilchrist was writing with the fervor and love any writer might have when penning the very first biography of a figure whose legend was already blossoming into something gargantuine.<br />But more frustrating than Ackyrod's dispassion is the eagerness with which he embraces enduring but disastrous presumptions about Blake. Chief among these is the astounding claim (made by so many others besides Ackroyd) that Blake somehow decided to &quot;turn inward&quot; and thus deny fame: &quot;he had the capacity to become a great public and religious poet but, instead, he turned in upon himself and gained neither influence nor reputation.&quot; But Blake WAS the &quot;great religious poet&quot; of his day, and Ackroyd himself concedes this early on: &quot;it can truly be said that he is the last great religous poet in England.&quot; Well, which is it, Peter? Any suggestion that Blake somehow missed out on his claim to this distinction says less about Blake than it does about our own epoch, in which we find it increasingly hard to measure success with any yardsticks other than those of the dollars, cents and celebrity.<br />It is no secret that many of history's most brilliant artists died in squalor because of their practical ineptitude. I don't think Blake cared much for mortgage rates or 401Ks when he was around, and thank god he had the courage not to. Ackroyd repeatedly demonstrates his understanding that Blake was a wholly impractical man and completely unskilled at the cruder concerns of survival, yet he still somehow finds a way to hold Blake responsible for his failures as an entrepreneur. &quot;He never could have been a tradesman,&quot; Ackroyd writes, &quot;he was 'totally destitute of the dexterity of a London shopman' and was 'sent away from the counter (of his father's shop) as a booby'.&quot; A &quot;booby.&quot; Sure doesn't sound like the description of a PR genius to me.<br />But Ackroyd goes even further in what amounts to a clear understanding that in order to become this &quot;public poet&quot; or &quot;great engraver&quot; Blake would have had to either ignore or compromise his artistic integrity. Sound like a familiar paradox? What Blake did for money and what Blake did for himself were two entirely different worlds in his life, and it is the latter that brought us &quot;Jerusalem,&quot; &quot;The Four Zoas,&quot; &quot;Milton&quot; and so many stirring and vibrantly colored plates. &quot;He could have continued as one of the best copy-engravers of his day,&quot; Ackroyd carries on, &quot;But ... he wished to experiment with his own technique.&quot; God forbid. Yes, he could have been marketable, but he was a visionary far more intrigued by his private muse than public fortune and the sacrifices it entailed. As Blake himself writes: &quot;I must create a System, or be enslav'd by another mans/I will not reason and Compare: my business is to create.&quot;<br />Throughout this book the conenction is made -- though apparently without Ackyroyd's comprehension -- between convention and success, withdrawal and genius. This does not have to be the fate of every innovator, but with Blake there just doesn't seem to have been any other way. Why Ackroyd choses not to see this when he himself weaves together all the evidence is truly baffling. Observations such as &quot;in want of income or renown, he had decided to return to more orthodox styles&quot; both make and miss the point. This was Blake's life-long misfortune and that of so many artists who, for the sake of survival, often have to make art of massive appeal, not of private vision or originality. Worse, the banality of the work Blake was sometimes hired to illustrate condemned him to contribute material of corresponding weakness. What an acute agony it must have been for this man to be employed by writers whose skill he knew fell far short of his own, and yet to have to sanction their own work with his time and sweat! I'll take poverty over such indignity any day of the week.<br />Predictably, Blake himself puts it best: &quot;To the Eyes of a Miser a Guinea is more beautiful than the Sun, and a bag worn with use of Money has more beautiful proportions than a Vine filled with grapes. The tree which moves some to tears of joy is in the Eyes of others only a Green thing that stands in the way.&quot; Amen, Mr. Blake.<br />To be fair, Ackroyd does show great sympathy for the complexity of Blake's character, and especially for the plight described above. Specifically, Ackroyd's investigation into the various personalities Blake manifested over the years, Blake's deep and heartbreaking identity with Job, and Ackroyd's explication of Blake's &quot;London&quot; are long-lasting contributions to Blake scholarship and show that Ackroyd is capable of far more inspiration than he otherwise exhibits throughout the book. For more informed and illuminating discussions of Blake's life and work, David Erdman's &quot;Prophet Against Empire,&quot; Harold Bloom's &quot;Blake's Apocalypse&quot; and, to a lesser extent, E.P. Thompson's &quot;Witness Against the Beast&quot; are so good as to render Ackroyd's book obsolete.all the evidence is truly baffling.

Thompson sets for himself in this book is to unearth Blake's obscure philosophical and literary heritage. Chiefly, he seeks to correct prior notions of Blake as a self-alienated figure who was almost wholly out of touch with his time.  The result is an occasionally unreadable but ultimately significant contribution to Blake scholarship.<br /><br />The book, meticulous in detail and enormous in scope, is so dense and fraught with an overwhelming amount of research and knowledge that, in the end, it seems Thompson wrote it not for the casual Blake enthusiast but for the Blake scholars with whom he quarrels in frequent disputes. As Thompson himself pauses to note: \\"I have been engaged, throughout the first part of this book, in an exceedingly difficult argument, and I am not wholly sure myself what this argument adduces.\\" When the author himself has to take a step back to warn the reader that he is not entirely certain of what he is doing, it is a pretty good way of posting up a fat and bold \\"BEWARE\\" in plain view of the reader.<br /><br />Though Thompson seems to have written this book for himself, the radiant intensity with which he attacks his subject makes for a deeply probing text. He even investigates the etymology of Blake's poetic vocabulary to flesh out his suspicion that the foundation for the poet's thought was laid over a century before his birth. In his quest to assign Blake a particular tradition, Thompson often succeeds so well as to contest Blake's very originality. Encouragingly, though, the sheer luminosity, energy and power of Blake's more inspired verse withstands most skepticism. Perhaps Blake's ideas themselves were not as original or isolated as other critics and biographers would have one believe, but we remember him still because of his talent for transforming into stark and masterful art the literary heritage Thompson uncovers.<br /><br />Thompson concedes that \\"if Blake read any or all\\" of the antecedent works he cites as his possible influences, \\"he read them in his own way. He employs an inherited vocabulary to make statements directly opposed to those authorized by the \\"Tradition\\". He appropriates old symbols and turns them to new purposes.\\"  Specifically, the tradition Blake is identified with is that of the Antinomians and Muggletonians (I know, sounds like something out of Gulliver's Travels), both of which closely resemble Blake's own beliefs on reason, liberty, the Fall, the book of Genesis, the trinity, desire and the notion that there is no God but man himself. The two sects abound with anticipations of Blake's \\"mind-forg'd manacles\\" and \\"chains of reason.\\" Even Blake's own mother is implicated as a Muggletonian (a marvelous distinction if I've ever heard one).<br /><br />Because Blake is writing out of this \\"tradition\\" Thompson assigns him, the conclusion is that the poet's work \\"has the confidence, an assured reference, very different from the speculations of an eccentric or a solitary . . . this man does not feel himself to be alone.\\" Gone is the image of a wild-eyed and fierce-jowled eccentric basking in the nude with his wife in their garden (which he did).<br /><br />For my tastes, the book labors too long over many uninteresting rhetorical debates and theoretical religious arguments between various 17th and 18th century sects. It is in this regard that the book requires a lot of patience, especially since Thompson keeps the reader waiting for any specific discussion of Blake's work until well over one hundred pages into the book. Then again, if learning that \\"Naamah is sister to Tubal-cain\\" is the kind of thing that gets you frothing at the mouth for more, then by all means, have at it. The problem is that Thompson seems to be writing two books at once, probing so extensively and thoroughly into Blake's alleged influences as to lose sight of the big picture which, presumably, is Blake's own life and work. The pattern is one in which Thompson will spend an inordinate amount of pages on a few forgotten religious movements in 17th or 18th century London and follow that up with a sudden \\"hmmm . . . so maybe these were Blake's guys . . . but let us look a little further\\" sort of thing.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the reader who refuses to lose sight of the topic at hand as easily as Thompson does at times will come away from the book with a feeling of having really gotten somewhere. In his investigation and analysis Thompson confirms some critical readings of Blake while replacing many others with some well-founded suppositions of his own, offering as clear and meaningful an understanding of Blake as this dramatically ambitious book can possibly allow. His discussion of Blake's prescient use of the word \\"chartr'd\\" in \\"London,\\" one of his most definitive poems, is nothing if not revelatory. The same goes for his discussions of \\"London's\\" various influences as well as the prolonged explication of Blake's \\"The Human Abstract.\\" It is here where Thompson most successfully endorses David Erdman's cause to demonstrate Blake's work as a reaction to the social and political realities of his day. Thompson's love for the poetry itself weans him off of his abstruse historical commentary in favor of a refreshingly plainspoken understanding of the work's origins and issues. Thankfully, this is the warmer tone with which the book concludes; I only wish Thompson could have stayed as close to the ground throughout the book as he does at its final stages.orgotten religious movements in 17th or 18th century London and follow that up with a sudden \\"hmmm . . . so maybe these were Blake's guys . . . but let us look a little further\\" sort of thing.

US	52095883	R3T3U1ECROY1OH	0156949601	193094981	The Waves	Books	5	33	40	N	N	Language as Action	With Woolf, as with Proust, it is easy to accuse the writing of being &quot;dull&quot; and lacking action or even plot. But for these authors the language itself IS the action. Nothing happens and yet everything happens. Just as their work tends to shy away from the conventions of the novel, I believe they are to be read just as unconventionally as they were written. Specifically, The Waves reads like the longest prose poem in the history of the language. When read as a &quot;novel&quot; it does indeed become every bit as difficult as a lot of readers say it is. Though Woolf attempts to differentiate between characters as though straining to achieve at least the skeletal image of the &quot;novel,&quot; she does this only superficially by drifting from one name to another. The unwavering language maintains precisely the same tone and intensity throughout, and the focus of Woolf's lucid inquiry never drifts far from its central themes. The book is a series of dramatic monologues that blend indistinguishably into one another. Woolf was preoccupied here with mortality, transience, loneliness and the meaning of friendship, not with telling a story (though a story does get told in the process). As a poem, though, it reads like a great lost chapter of the Bible; a curious, explosive and inward lexicon of the human experience so sacred in its expression as to be humanly impossible. &quot;All mists curl off the roof of my being,&quot; Woolf muses in one of the book's most gorgeous lines. It is a perfect description of the alert reader's response: an exuberance bordering on epiphany. If Dickinson is right and the great poem makes one feel as though the top of one's head has been sawn off, then The Waves is a great poem. There have been many great writers, but few who approach the eloquent desperation of this text.	2004-07-17
US	52095883	R3156X9VWKKGJ9	0374179905	87148544	John Clare: A Biography	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Fabulous Portrait	Endearing, moving and mysterious, this is as sensitive a portrait of John Clare as we are likely to get. Bate's love for his subject is obvious throughout the book, in which he succeeds so well at walking the line between adoration and accuracy. Teeming with observations such as &quot;for Clare even a fishpond is saturated with feeling and memory,&quot; Clare's unusually intense absorption in nature is brought to light here with the kind of beauty and empathy only a fellow-writer such as Bate could achieve.<br />Yet despite Bate's insistence on Clare's genius (I'm quite insistent on it myself after having read the biography and skimming through the Selected Poems) he does not look away from uglier aspects of Clare's life: his infidelity and apparent spousal abuse, his alcoholism and, most of all, the ever-bewildering case of his diagnosis as a &quot;lunatic.&quot;  This is where Bate's book becomes particularly poignant, and I wish he had spent less time gossiping about Clare's wrangles with publishers and more on the man's complicated and harrowing character. For this reason I felt the book to be a bit longer than it needed to be, but perhaps I'd feel differently had the material in the last 150 pages, which deals extensively with Clare's mental illness, been fleshed-out even more. Surely accounts of Clare's occasional belief that he was Lord Byron or Jack Randall the boxer are of far more interest than how many pounds he was paid for a poem published in the London Magazine.<br />Nonetheless, Bate does an excellent job of avoiding the temptation to romanticize Clare's dramatic mental illness (for which, in the end, &quot;manic-depression&quot; seems to be the most accurate but not necessarily conclusive diagnosis. In her incredible book, Touched With Fire, Kay Redfield Jamison lists Clare's name among the poets she counted as victims of manic-depressive illness). Unlike other biographers of writers (Quentin Bell's book about Virginia Woolf comes to mind) Bate does not settle for Clare's own metaphorical explanations for his &quot;madness.&quot; Indeed, Bate often disputes the very term &quot;madness&quot; and exposes it as a dated and even superstitious label. He does not so thoroughly drench the artist's mental struggles in myth and theory as to have it become the stuff of folklore. Surely it would be flattering to think of Clare as some divinely inspired mystic, but Bate's many more logical scenarios are a refreshing contrast to the &quot;mad genius&quot; stereotype.<br />While Clare attributed his madness to the day he watched a friend fall to his death from a tree as a child, Bate's more plausible suggestions include: Clare's concussion after tumbling out of a tree himself as a boy, his heavy drinking, the awful malnutrition of his diet, the tormenting stress of his perpetual poverty amid obligations to his wife and seven children, his frustrating efforts to further himself as a poet while having to beg for farm work, and &quot;mercury-poisoning resulting from attempted treatment for syphilis.&quot; In a further example of Bate's mature handling of this particular issue, he writes that &quot;we should not rule out the possibility that his own derangement was partially shaped by his reading about the mental suffering of other writers.&quot; Clare was terribly impressionable. However, where Bate tells us that Clare's &quot;episodes&quot; afflicted him only after being admitted to the aszlum as if to imply that he was bound to become psychotic after living among the mad for two decades, Jamison writes in &quot;Touched With Fire&quot; that &quot;manic-depressive illness not only worsens over time, it becomes less responsive to medication the longer&quot; it goes untreated, so it seems only logical that his condition would have worsened with age, especially since no such &quot;treatment&quot; as Jamison discusses was available in his day.<br />Compounding the reasonable possibilities Bate offers is the fact that Clare's very devotion to write poetry may have been interpreted as madness by his neighbors. Tragically, this seems to be a chief reason why he was eventually confined. As Bate says early on, &quot;In summer he walked in the woods and fields alone, a book in his pocket . . . his love of books began to isolate him from other boys . . . the villagers found this behavior very odd: `some fancying it symptoms of lunacy.'&quot; Even after reading the book, it is anyone's guess as to whether Clare was insane; but stories of his battles against what illness he may have suffered from as well as the ignorance, incompetence and greed of those purporting to care for him make for a rather heart-breaking read. What we can be sure of, though, is that mad or not, Clare had become more of a liability than a father or husband. &quot;There is no evidence that he was taken to the asylum because he was `mad' in the sense of having lost consciousness of his identity . . . he was taken to the asylum because he needed better care than could be provided by his family,&quot; Bate writes.<br />Though he probably takes a bit too much liberty in attempting to explain nearly every one of Clare's symptoms in a more rational light, Bate's assertions about Clare's psychological temperament make for some absolutely riveting explications and commentary. &quot;To say that he had written the works of Byron and Scott was but an extreme way of saying he had written works that he hoped might one day be regarded as the equal of&quot; those works, he supposes. In an even farther-fetching attempt at psychoanalysis, Bate explains Clare's delusion that he was a famous boxer as a dramatization &quot;of the fact that Clare spent his life fighting battles - for his poetry, for recognition, for survival, against his inner demons.&quot; While this is probably the point at which Bate seems more of an adoring and apologetic fan than biographer, who's to say? We will never really know what was going on inside that jewel of a mind, and considering all that was taken from the man in his life by his illness, time, or other people, maybe that secret is the one thing we can let Clare keep.evotion to write poetry may have been interpreted as madness by his neighbors.

US	52095883	R38GDHUNTJTXEM	0374528691	469546766	"I Am": The Selected Poetry of John Clare	Books	4	26	26	N	N	Great Stuff, Questionable Selection	The only thing more remarkable than John Clare's talent is that it has taken so long for it to receive the wider audience it deserves. Time and again in Jonathan Bate's appreciable but over-long biography we learn of great poems left to petrify in the dust of museums until &quot;well into the twentieth century.&quot; That neglect alone qualifies as a disturbing testament to the cruelty with which some of literature's greatest geniuses flounder and fade under the rubble of history. Though Bate's recent biography is commendable in its success at introducing readers not just to Clare's complicated character, but also to the poet's technical, formal and linguistic ingenuity; he consistently describes poems in the biography that he chose not to include in this &quot;Selected Poems.&quot; Most tragic is his decision not to include so many of the poems left out of the original published version of &quot;The Rurual Muse.&quot; Moreover, to consider Bate's tantalizing description of some of the poems included in &quot;The Rural Muse&quot; along with his decision to leave them out of this Selected Poems is to encounter the strange misguidedness with which Clare's genius has been treated over the centuries. Writing of &quot;Mary,&quot; the childhood love of Clare's life that haunted him into his grave, Bate says that &quot;She is the subject of `The Milking Hour' which &quot;recalls a final evening conversation with her, walking in a wheat field; and in `Nutting'&quot; in which &quot;Clare compares her auburn hair to the colour of ripe hazels, they shell nuts together, she flirtatiously throws the shells at him and then blushes when he pockets the husks as a keepsake.&quot; Yet neither poem can be found in this book. Even if page-count was the issue in putting this book together (one that contributed to the unfortunate underrepresentation of Clare's work in his lifetime), I seriously doubt that a lousy two more poems -- the very poems about which Bate speaks so seductively in his biography -- would have been problematic. Such tender images as Bate offers with regard to these poems must have made for some riveting verse from Clare, especially considering the enormous power of &quot;First Love's Recollection,&quot; another poem about Mary from &quot;The Rural Muse&quot; Bate deigned to include here, or another of Clare's great &quot;Mary&quot; poems, &quot;Love and Memory&quot;:<br />Thou art gone the dark journey<br />That leaves no returning;<br />`Tis fruitless to mourn thee<br />But who can help mourning<br />To think of the life<br />That did laugh on thy brow<br />In the beautiful past<br />Left so desolate now?<br />This is just the first stanza of a poem whose unusual lyrical intensity is sustained throughout. Why Bate couldn't have tossed in just a few more such poems - particularly the ones he talks about in his biography - is as baffling as it is enraging. After so much neglect and misfortune, one would think that Bate might have been a bit more discerning in his choice of poems to include here. It is time for Clare's reputation to be granted its very just reward, and I am afraid that Bate may have missed his chance. (Though I see that he has chosen to participate in the debate himself here, which exemplifies the deep love that must have motivated him to spend so much time and energy on the biography. His point about ratings and discussion is an excellent one.)<br />Nonetheless, readers will undoubtedly be thankful for some of the unbelievable writing Bate did select for this collection, such as the riveting &quot;The Fallen Elm&quot; in which we find ghostly anticipations of Auden, Philip Levine and Seamus Heany. Speaking of the elm whose falling prompted one of the most moving letters to a friend Clare ever penned, Clare writes:<br />Thou owned a language by which hearts are stirred<br />Deeper than by a feeling clothed in words,<br />And speakest now what's known of every tongue,<br />Language of pity and the force of wrong.<br />What amazing writing. That last line smacks of Auden's best work, particularly his masterful &quot;September 1, 1939.&quot; The broad strokes of Clare's longer work are matched in power only by his more compact and formally unprecedented sonnets. In the biography, Bates writes that &quot;Clare challenged the conventions of poetic diction by using the vocabulary of his region; in his poems of the 1830s he challenged the conventions of form, revealing that the sonnet could be divided up in new ways.&quot;  Bates goes on to note that some of the rhyme schemes Clare employed in his sonnets are without precedent, while the timing of his execution simultaneously challenges and revitalizes an overly familiar poetic form. But beyond all of this jargon and technical criticism, the sheer emotional boundlessness of so many of Clare's sonnets is what really strikes home. Bates suggests that Clare is England's greatest poet of childhood. While I think such a statement undermines Blake's achievement, it is not unfair to consider Clare a very close second to Blake. Poems like Blake's &quot;London&quot; or &quot;The Sick Rose&quot; meet their match in some of Clare's more impassioned stretches of verse.<br />That the world has gone without fully recognizing one of its quieter geniuses is a sad fact of history now. At least someone is trying. Though Bate counts Clare's complete poems to the amount of &quot;3500,&quot; it does not seem unreasonable to ask for a more comprehensive representation of the man's achievement. After all, Thomas Hardy's complete poems is over 900 pages long, and while the power of Hardy's work waned with age, Clare wrote some great material while languishing away in asylums as an older man.  Even Hardy's amazing earlier poems -- &quot;The Darkling Thrush&quot; or &quot;Neutral Tones,&quot; for instance -- fail to entirely outdo a good portion of Clare's work. The two poets are quite comparable, especially since Clare tackled precisely the same themes -- nature, mortality, lost loves, nostalgia -- and sometimes with just as much if not more majesty. I really applaud Bate's great effort on behalf of Clare, and though asking for more in the face of such hard work does little justice to my sincere gratitude, I still think some attention need be paid to the scattered nature of Clare's published writings. I think a fuller example of his work ought to be included in one book, not thrown across many different volumes. If Bate is not the man for this job, hopefully somebody else will be in my lifetime.br />What amazing writing.

Throughout \\"X,\\" a collection of poems dwelling largely on his defunct marriage with fellow poet Jorie Graham, Galvin relies on the reader's own conscience and experience to finish each poem's meaning and affect, often transcending this basic rule of poetic law by digging deeper, excavating past losses and interrogating the difficult present, the struggle to go on. \\"After bad things happen we always live/A little more,\\" Galvin observes in a language as simple as it is moving.<br />Routinely, Galvin steps out of the way of his poems to let them speak their way out of loss, stifling so much as a jaded chuckle in the textured silence following every final line. If the trick to conveying heartbreak convincingly in contemporary poetry is to simply tell what happened, rather than wrestling readers into feeling your pain, \\"X\\" provides ample instruction:<br />So out of love with life am I<br />No future will have me.<br />How can you lose a lie?<br />Well, you can. Easy.<br />All those years together, it seems,<br />Were posturings of goodbye.<br />For a time I raved.<br />Now I dwell in moods and reveries<br />Like frightened birds-<br />Galvin's bursts of thwarted longing are calculated with such tact and precise timing that they leap off of the page. By the time he gets around to saying, simply, \\"You are in love with/someone else\\" or \\"Why aren't you in love with me,\\" the stage has already been so patiently set for a heaving sigh of empathy that only the dead could turn the page without at least a quiver in the chin. \\"Everyone drifts/in their disastrous bodies,\\" Galvin writes in the book's first poem, \\"Little Dantesque.\\" Just midway into this opening poem, the reader already has little reason to suspect that Galvin's lines are anything less than  flakes chipped from a soul in smolder. \\"Love's not love until it's lost,\\" he writes in a later poem. The body and its carriage of lusts has indeed proven disastrous, as the \\"threadbare\\" speaker continually \\"drifts\\" along an impasse of things that were: \\"I had a happy medium/Had her reading out of my palm/The circus folded up and left.\\"<br />Inevitably, there are fleeting descents into mushiness and melodramatics, as when Galvin signs off the poem \\"Dear May Eight,\\" \\"Yours, May Eighth /Sincerely/Man under influence of sky.\\" Additionally, a couple of poems read less like verse and more like tongue-twisting transcripts from some spelling-bee:<br />Algorithmic,<br />Epigenetic,<br />He ciphers ciphers.<br /><br />Generally, though, the poems in \\"X\\" demonstrate the talents of a master craftsmen, fraught with biting, alliterative moments of rhythm-\\"O wretched road in rain,\\" \\"an inner din unending\\"- and heroic first lines that could eat through a cage, \\"This is the wave of gravel where she left me off the edge of my life\\" or \\"The whole night sky went bad in the knees.\\" Further, from the villanelle \\"River Edged With Ice\\" to the end-rhymed \\"Dear Nobody's Business\\" or sprawling, long-lined masterpieces such as \\"Earthquake,\\" \\"Leap Year\\" and \\"Depending on the Wind,\\" Galvin's poetic range knows no end.<br />\\"Where Once I was not alone, now each/closed door is panic, and spaces grow immense with memory, like/shadows at dusk,\\" Galvin writes in \\"Depending on the Wind,\\" a spare, precise eulogy to the house he built with his hands for a family fated to leave him, \\"Gone that arrangement of allegiances called family/we never really know before it ends/Like love itself, it isn't true till/then.\\" Seemingly dizzy with crestfallen lines such as these, Galvin deftly skirts the boundary between authenticity and mawkishness, and whether it's a nightingale crooning on a nearby windowsill or a case of the old heartbreak that's got him down, James Galvin's \\"X\\" guarantees the sure rise of his stature.ouse he built with his hands for a family fated to leave him, \\"Gone that arrangement of allegiances called family/we never really know before it ends/Like love itself, it isn't true till/then.\\" Seemingly dizzy with crestfallen lines such as these, Galvin deftly skirts the boundary between authenticity and mawkishness, and whether it's a nightingale crooning on a nearby windowsill or a case of the old heartbreak that's got him down, James Galvin's \\"X\\" guarantees the sure rise of his stature.	2003-06-06

Michael Ondaatje's sprawling sequence of verse interspersed with poetic prose exposes the persona poem as one of poetry's surest paths to honesty. Through unsettlingly precise detail and unsentimental empathy, the character of Billy the Kid is recreated-and revisited-in all its brutality and splendor. Ondaatje's unflinching commitment to honesty yields a persona that is as vibrant and realized as possible, resulting in a series of confessions that range from disturbing to revelatory.<br /><br />The image, consistently startling, graphic and discomforting, carries the speaker through the entire sequence. Whereas most imagery depends on the eye for effect, Ondaatje utilizes all five senses throughout the book. We taste wine \\"so fine/it was like drinking ether,\\" we feel Pat Garret's \\"oiled rifle\\" against Maxwell's cheek and hear it fire beside his ear, \\"leaving a powder scar on Maxwell's face that stayed with him all his life.\\" We smell the smoke in Garret's shirt and taste the nicotine in his mouth. At times, the stunned silence of Ondaatje's unremitting narrative conjures a hush so palpable that we can \\"listen to deep buried veins in our palms.\\" It doesn't take long for The Collected Works of Billy the Kid to immerse the reader in its own unique world, accessible now only through words and photographs.<br />Most memorable, though, are the intensely graphic images that sprout from the page throughout the book. The chicken digging for a vein in the dying Gregory's neck, the warts in Billy the Kid's throat \\"breaking through veins like pieces of long glass tubing,\\" the blood caked in Tom O'Folliard's \\"hair, arms, shoulders, everywhere.\\" All these paint an unmistakable landscape of a bleak and desolate New Mexico in the 1880's, a scene so haunted that even \\"the sun turned into a pair of hands\\" and pulled out hairs from Billy the Kid's head which, we're told later, is \\"smaller than a rat.\\" Not one potentially enlivening detail is overlooked; not one square inch of landscape or action escapes the reader's view.<br /><br />Ondaatje's ambitious project demonstrates that the recipe for great writing is precise detail compounded by believable emotion, a recipe he follows to the letter. Ondaatje executes these two devices so effectively at times that a kind of piercing, revelatory insight emerges periodically. Magical disclosures such as the characterization of Pat Garrett as one who \\"became frightened of flowers because they grew so slowly he couldn't tell what they planned to do,\\" help to fully realize both the character of Billy the Kid and the times in which he lived, and establish Ondaatje's book as perhaps one of the greatest attempts at persona poetry in the 20th century.r action escapes the reader's view.<BR> <BR>Ondaatje's ambitious project demonstrates that the recipe for great writing is precise detail compounded by believable emotion, a recipe he follows to the letter.

In \\"The Glass Essay,\\" she resorts to this device immediately and often:<br />She lives on a moor in the north.<br />She lives alone.<br />Spring opens like a blade there.<br />Already, in just three short lines of the 38-page poem's fourth stanza, we encounter loneliness, landscape and season, distinctly echoing past triumphs such as \\"The Life of Towns,\\" as in \\"Town of Spring Once Again,\\" for instance:<br />Rain hissed down the windows.<br />Longings from a great distance.<br />Reached us.<br />Despite the periods, the enjambment of these lines is obvious, and more startling. Drops of rain become \\"longings from a great distance\\" but, at the same time, the origin of these \\"longings\\" remains mysterious. From where are they \\"reaching\\" the speaker? The reader is left to imagine and savor.<br />It is in Carson's skill for weaving Emily Bronte's persona together with the speaker's, however, that \\"The Glass Essay's\\" abundant despair becomes most compelling. Like Bronte, whose storied alienation and seclusion comprise much of the poem's focus, the speaker identifies deeply with the moor's landscape. \\"My lonely life around me like a moor,\\" she says, going on to describe the moor as \\"paralyzed with ice\\" in a moment of pathetic fallacy.<br />Similarly, just as Bronte is described as a \\"soul trapped in glass\\" and a \\"wacher\\" who \\"wached the poor core of the world,\\" the speaker becomes just as imprisoned and secluded, obsessively noting the minutest observations as she gazes into \\"the curtainless morning\\" like someone under a life sentence. By poem's end, though, the speaker emerges from the malaise that Bronte only escapes through death. \\"I gave up watching,\\" the speaker confesses, \\"I lived my life.\\" Finally, in the speaker's own inability to endure the intense loneliness under which Bronte lived (and died), Emily Bronte's own life struggle becomes that much more palpable.ly with the moor's landscape. \\"My lonely life around me like a moor,\\" she says, going on to describe the moor as \\"paralyzed with ice\\" in a moment of pathetic fallacy.  <br />Similarly, just as Bronte is described as a \\"soul trapped in glass\\" and a \\"wacher\\" who \\"wached the poor core of the world,\\" the speaker becomes just as imprisoned and secluded, obsessively noting the minutest observations as she gazes into \\"the curtainless morning\\" like someone under a life sentence.

There is far more emotion and tumult in the nuanced, obsessive and precise imagery of yellow moths sagging against locked screens on a languid summer evening than in that of a \\"TV parlor/in the best ward in Bedlam.\\" She over-dramatizes where she ought to invigorate, and assumes that the basic, cold facts of her own widely publicized struggle with manic-depressive illness sufficed for poetry, an assumption that tends to enervate even her best poems.<br />Such is the case with the otherwise gorgeous and stirring \\"Lullaby,\\" or with the poem \\"Flee On Your Donkey,\\" which begins with such promise: \\"Because there was no other place/to flee to/I came back to the scene of the disordered senses,\\" but descends into a kind of Go Ask Alice passage: \\"Keeping only a pack of Salemn cigarettes/The way a child holds on to a toy/I signed myself in where a stranger/puts the inked-in X's--/for this is a mental hospital/not a child's game\\" and \\"In here/the same old crowd/the same ruined scene.\\" This as close to the border of doggerel as I've ever seen an acclaimed poet come.<br />Sexton's decision to abandon the taut, structured and compact stanzas of her intense early work in favor of the casual, conversational and wooden free verse of her later years stifled her imagination, and blurred the distinction between genuine poetry and mere mystique.<br />Reading over these poems a second time convinced me that it is not Sexton's work itself that contributes most to her repute but, unfortunately, her now-legendary illness and suicide. Her attempts to convert this legend into poetry were, for the most part, just as \\"embarrassing\\" as Robert Lowell suggests in the quote from Maxime Kumin's foreword. I find that Sexton's work is most powerful when not explicitly \\"confessing\\" the circumstances of her mental illness, but exploring one torn human being's conflict and engagement with the immediately surrounding world, as in the beautiful, terrifying and non-confessional \\"The Moss of His Skin,\\" a persona poem of considerable power.<br /><br />That Sexton seemed more impressed with her own illness than her talent is a doleful misfortune for the greater world of poetry. Reading through her complete poems reveals that the full promise of her talent was never realized.t, just as \\"embarrassing\\" as Robert Lowell suggests in the quote from Maxime Kumin's foreword.

If the human being is doomed to fallibility, perhaps we might learn &quot;how to love amid the encroachments,&quot; as Dunn suggests in his uniquely poignant plainspokenness.<br />But if, after so many books of thwarted longing, Dunn's observations on &quot;how boring sorrows are&quot; is not enough of a refreshment to his seasoned readers, then the playful, imaginative and engaging section of poems in which he escorts a cadre of famous authors through the landscape of his Native New Jersey serves as a remarkable new dimension to Dunn's distinctive and persistent voice.<br />&quot;Because the famous usually have little to say/to each other after the first paeans of praise,&quot; Dunn explains, &quot;the poet thought that for their own sakes/he'd have them live in separate towns.&quot; Pivoting off of this introductory poem, Dunn leaps into a succession of poems with titles such as &quot;Chekhov in Port Republic,&quot; &quot;Charlotte Bronte in Leeds Point,&quot; &quot;George Eliot in Beach Haven,&quot; and &quot;Twain in Atlantic City.&quot;<br />With his imagination tuned to a fever pitch, these particular poems read like short stories in verse, brimful of ideas, wit and confidence, guaranteeing the well-versed reader's pleasure. &quot;Occasionally the weak survive/because the god that doesn't exist/wants to give us something to misinterpret/That's what Crane was thinking as he washed up on Longport Beach,&quot; Dunn narrates in &quot;Stephen Crane in Longport.&quot;<br />While Dunn's playfulness here is more indicative of the work of Billy Collins or Deborah Garrison, still his voice maintains its gravity and cunning as he delves beneath the hearts of his subjects, revealing the alienation that burdened the young, brilliant Stephen Crane: &quot;It's pointless, Crane wanted to say/wherever you're all going/but he knew they'd think he was lying/or maybe not even hear him.&quot;<br />Though a familiar tinge of helplessness enervates the book's tendency towards an awareness of the world's smaller, more manageable delights, it does not overwhelm or sour Dunn's attempt to emerge from the smolder and ruin of Different Hours. Local Visitations is likely one of Dunn's boldest and brightest books, suggesting that the resignation pervading Different Hours is only a temporary waiting room for those whose eyes are fixed on that &quot;meaningful task waiting to be found.&quot;quot;<br />Though a familiar tinge of helplessness enervates the book's tendency towards an awareness of the world's smaller, more manageable delights, it does not overwhelm or sour Dunn's attempt to emerge from the smolder and ruin of Different Hours.

While a far more original, imaginative and involving account of the great corporate slob that is America can be found in Alan Lightman's brilliant, recent novel, &quot;The Diagnosis,&quot;Berman's book stands as a necessary and forthright excavation of the American ethos.<br />The disease is the increasingly impersonal, mass-market conglomerate digesting any suggestion of uniqueness, inquisitiveness or energy in each individual, replacing those virtues with such poisons as advertisement, bureaucracy and a government whose address is Bill Gates's wallet. The problem with this otherwise good, learned and brazen book is Berman's frequent retreat to rather tired themes such as an appalling American literacy rate compounded by an increasing interest in Hallmark literature and Deepok Chopra seminars, stunning failures in American education accompanied by the death of the &quot;knowledge for the sake of knowledge&quot; ethic, where a young person's motivation for going to college is not to learn, not to foster any semblance of curiosity or interest in Berman's much-vaunted classics, but rather to paste fancy letters at the end of their names to show to the Bossman, who will hopefully accomodate them with salaries that can support cable tv bills, Versace suits and 'Nsync tickets; &quot;Anodynes,&quot; as Berman correctly identifies them.<br />Berman explores more fertile, original territory when he links the enlightenment period to the swarming onslaught of corporate culture. While we may have all heard the claim that within every great civilization's virtues lie the seeds of its demise, Berman's patient explanation of the process by which pride in the individual, in human reason, and education, whelped consumerism still strikes a chord. Berman distinguishes between &quot;a good enlightenment and a bad one. The former is the Age of Reason, the world of Hume and Voltaire. . . . The latter is the modern obsession with qualification, control, and the domination of the natural world&quot; (Berman 114). This idea that man's most beautiful achievements eventually errode into parodies of themselves runs like a river throughout the book, and when Berman applies this notion to a linkage of the enlightenment era to contemporary American society, the book becomes particularly resonant: &quot;It was during the twentieth century that science, technology, and industry effectively merged into something approaching a unified enterprise, and scientific research lies at the heart of corporate research and development, manufacture, and economic expansion. Even a casual look at the Fortune 500 companies underscores this. Rubber, steel, television, automobile production, the software and information industry--the list goes on and on,&quot; Berman asserts (113).<br />Ultimately, Berman's &quot;Monastic option&quot; is appealing because it is stripped of its idealistic, religious connotations and redefined to confront contemporary concerns. Berman's monastic option recalls the Kantian vision of a sense of the intrinsic value of each human being, of each individual as a potential contribution to society--not economically, but culturally, spirtually, artistically and otherwise. The endeavor for those who come away from Berman's book with a renewed sense of hope, despit the author's rather grave prophecies, is to resist the tempting bliss of conformity, to resist becoming an economic unit in favor of your own dignity, individuality and honesty. Berman's book takes the first step, it helps readers recognize the enemy, and in recognizing the impending disorder flourishing under our noses, we may have a better chance at productive resistance, at living more honest and human lives. While books such as Berman's are now tending more towards familiar warnings rather than fresh observations, they are still quite necessary reminders that we are human beings, not ratings statistics, dollar signs and poll numbers. Let's hope Berman's cadre of social critics maintains its energy, presence and effort.towards familiar warnings rather than fresh observations, they are still quite necessary reminders that we are human beings, not ratings statistics, dollar signs and poll numbers.

This novel's power resides not only in its message, but in the way in which that message is conveyed. Trumbo's masterpiece is not just a resonant statement against war, but a unique and indispensable contribution to American literature. His Joyce-like stream-of-consciousness fuses the text with a magnificent flavor. The language sprawls gloriously across each page. &quot;I do not read; I eat,&quot; Simone Weil writes in &quot;Waiting For God.&quot; Trumbo's language invites readers to eat rather than read, to flip the pages as though they would light one's fingers on fire if held too long.<br />His brutally honest style is quotidian yet magical. It is the kind of simplicity embraced by such mythical literary voices as Ernest Hemmingway or Czeslaw Milosz. In fact, &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; shares the plight of 20th century polish poets, who forcibly eliminated all romantic, inflated, grandiose or flowery imagery from their literature in response to a world so ugly that romanticism seemed a dishonest veil over the reality of a bloody century. Trumbo's reaction to that reality is similar, as his sparklingly mundane voice demonstrates.<br />It is not only in his language, however, that Trumbo rises to the occasional of the best literature in American history. This is also a work of extraordinary imagination. Touchingly human flashbacks to times in the life of Joe, the main character, evoke moving meditations on love, family, and friendship, as well as a rather disturbing portrayal of working life in the depression era. &quot;To talk with Lucy to be with Lucy to lie with Lucy was like finding peace in a heathen country it was like breathing the air of a place you love when you're sick and dying for a breath of it,&quot; Joe thinks to himself while in his hospital bed, deaf, blind and limbless, &quot;To see her smile to hear her bright chatter to watch her bony little fingers fly as they worked the crochet needle with the night noises of Paris a foreign city just outside the window was enough to make anybody feel better and less lonely.&quot; Trumbo captures the devastating sorrow of a man who will never know the sensations of life again, from love to yellow puddles of leaves in the gutters of October. Finally, Trumbo's patient and vivid account of Joe's circumstance, that of a severely incapacitated victim of war, is so thoroughly haunting that, despite the improbability of such a catastrophic injury, Joe's situation becomes frighteningly real and believable. By now we all know that &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; stands as perhaps the most heartfelt and effective indictment of war, but it is to the benefit of American literature that it be recognized as the work of a monumentally talented writer.hile in his hospital bed, deaf, blind and limbless, &quot;To see her smile to hear her bright chatter to watch her bony little fingers fly as they worked the crochet needle with the night noises of Paris a foreign city just outside the window was enough to make anybody feel better and less lonely.&quot; Trumbo captures the devastating sorrow of a man who will never know the sensations of life again, from love to yellow puddles of leaves in the gutters of October.

This collection reads like a novel, it is really a fluid sequence of accounts of his wife's death, either in devastatingly ironic and witty snapshots or extended odes and elegies such as the harrowing &quot;Letter With No Address,&quot; written to his dead wife, nearly all of which will grab you by the throat and suck you into the spaces in between the words. Hall knew that if he was going to try and rip a vein of life from his soul and convey its contents to his readers, he could only do so by immersing them within the poems themselves. Few poets ever develop the kind of authenticity of voice required to achieve such a feat. It is surely a standard to which any poet aspires.<br />Donald Hall approached this project perfectly. This is not a collection that stammers with captivating imagery or the kind of unfathomable metaphorical connections that are found in the work of our best American poets such as Hart Crane or Walt Whitman. Hall knew that in devoting a collection of poems to such a personal and painful experience, one that obviously left its fang marks on his heart, he risked committing some of the cardinal sins of poetry, such as mawkishness and self-pity.<br />Hall avoids those pitfalls at every conceivable instance. His ability to blend sentimentality with dry irony and compelling wit, compounded by his successful effort to keep himself out of the poems despite his inevitable relation to them, make this the finest collection of his career, and indeed the work of a man who just may be ranked among our very top American poets somewhere down the line. Without stands among the most riveting documents of love, desire and loss to be found throughout the history of American Poetry.	2001-01-26

Like most of our lauded poets, he drowned the audience in a forcible modesty, at one point saying that he is only thought of as a worker's poet, but he's &quot;really not.&quot; Well, whether that is just another artist's malevolence towards critics of the day or honest sentiment, The Mercy seems to back him up.<br />Unlike past masterpieces such as &quot;Names of the Lost&quot; or &quot;What Work Is,&quot; The Mercy indulges in an extra dollop of jazz poems, such as the eulogy to the great Sonny Rollins, feeding his horn with breath on Manhattan's Williamsburg Bridge, breath that &quot;became the music of the world,&quot; as Levine puts it in one of The Mercy's best poems, &quot;The Unknowing.&quot; Of course, this collection offers Levine's typically brilliant working poems, such as the first poem, &quot;Smoke.&quot; &quot;Why/ was the air filled with smoke?&quot; Levine writes, &quot;Simple. We had work/Work was something that thrived on fire, that without/ fire couldn't catch its breath or hang on for life.&quot;<br />But there is yet a third dimension to Levine that surfaces here, an element of playfulness, of constructing the poems as conversations between speaker and reader, such as on the just-mentioned poem, in which he speaks of smoke in the first stanza and drifts off onto something of a tangent, and as if his ear were not just tuned to the cadence of his own poem but also to the reader's mind, he writes, &quot;Go back to the beginning, you insist.&quot; And he does. Other times, it is as if Levine were writing about writing, almost mocking his chosen art, as on poems such as &quot;Clouds Above the Sea,&quot; a poem about his parents standing side by side, &quot;I could give her a rope of genuine pearls/as a gift for bearing my father's sons/ and let each pearl glow with a child's fire/ I could turn her toward you now with a smile/ so that we might joy in her constancy.&quot;<br />This sort of teasing propells these poems to the heights of tragicomedy, as most poems are deeply rooted in the heavy world of tragic characters that pervade most of Levine's work. Only this time, any element of mawkishness has evaporated, and we get a curious blend of laughs and sighs leaping from each page. Perhaps this is The mercy's most impressive facet; that now in his early seventies and after forty years worth of books, Philip Levine's poetry continues to evolve.; <br />This sort of teasing propells these poems to the heights of tragicomedy, as most poems are deeply rooted in the heavy world of tragic characters that pervade most of Levine's work.

Tosches writes: &quot;&quot;One thing was certain: in that rematch...when Sonny lay down in the first, he showed less acting ability than in the episode of Love American Style in which he later bizarrely appeared.&quot;<br />Hello? Am I the only one who read this book with some sort of discernment? What more do we need? THE MAN LAYED DOWN IN THE FIRST ROUND BECAUSE THE MOB TOLD HIM TO, AND HE LISTENED. YES, IT WAS A FIX. YES, IT WAS A PHANTOM PUNCH.<br />What we have here are the opinions of an era in which stories that are not told in two minutes are just no good, and tales that leave themselves open to interpretation are simply burdensome or, as one reviewer claims, &quot;melodramatic.&quot;<br />Some reviewers opine that the book leaves us without an answer as to the cause of Liston's death. Again, I just don't see the confusion on this one. Here are the author's own words: &quot;he took too much dope and died (page 253).&quot; Hmm...sounds like a rather conclusive answer to me, folks.<br />Well, Nick, looks like your kind are an endangered species. No time for poetry, no time for artful metaphor, this is the age of &quot;give us ten minutes, we'll give you the world.&quot;<br />Truth is, The Devil and Sonny Liston is one of the best biographies I've ever read. It is suspenseful, yet poetic, informative and conclusive, yet open-minded and expansive. Nick Tosches took one ugly, shady life and turned it into a brutally honest piece of poetry that guarantees to leave readers unsettled at the book's end. In all truth, that's how you know that this is a great book, people were left thinking after the last period. As for myself, I went out and bought three Nick Tosches books after I read The Devil and Sonny Liston, because Tosches instantly became one of my favorite writers.

These three plays are arguably the essential core of the Williams canon, and certainly a great starting place for novices.<br />Sweey Bird of Youth is blessed with  perhaps the finest epitaph ever in a modern drama, when the play's main  character emanates Williams's legendary compassion with the concluding  line, &quot;all I ask is for the recognition of me in you, and time, the  enemy, in us all.&quot; Shakespeare would have salivated.<br />Both the Rose  Tattoo and Night of the Iguana exhibit Ibsen's impression upon Williams, as  Williams incorporates brilliant metaphor's that wrap around both plays like  knotted ribbons, but Williams's poetic language in each surpasses that of  Ibsen by eons. Much in the vein of Ibsen's The Wild Duck or Chekov's The  Seagull, Williams gives us a lesson in fate, freedom and human desire with  his Iguana, tied to a post by a rope and struggling to escape, waiting to  be killed as food, and he walks us through a world of intense nostalgia and  heartbreak with the Rose Tattoo marking the chests of Serafina's lovers.<br />Even O'Neil, lauded by most as our finest American playwright, never  quite matched the powerful language of the heart that saturates these three  works of gritty, raw desire and nostalgia. Both of which, as Williams  insists, take up plenty of space in the hearts of all.	2000-06-20

A poor boy from Kansas City, Clyde Griffiths is disconcerted by his parents' naïve religiosity and  dreams of transcending his abstemious upbringing. He takes to the streets  to start a life of his own, and is immediately enthralled by the grandeur  of lavish hotels and clubs, worshipping their wealthy patrons.<br />Working  as a bellhop for a luxurious hotel, all seems to go well until he gets  caught in a group of careless kids-trouble. He eventually flees Kansas  City, his hometown, after a little girl is killed in a car accident with  which he was involved. He takes up a job in a fancy Chicago club, where me  meets his rich and successful Uncle, Samuel Griffiths, who owns a collar  business in New York-more trouble. Clyde finds work in his uncle's factory,  where he falls in love with and impregnates a girl, Roberta Alden, who  works for him, despite the rule that no supervisor is permitted to become  involved with his workers.<br />This is when the real trouble begins for  Clyde, as he falls in love with another girl, Sondra Finchley, just after  he gets the news of Roberta's pregnancy. Sondra is certainly no worker, she  is the daughter of a rich family in the wealthy town of Lycurgus, new York.  Sondra, who becomes infatuated with Clyde despite her mother's advice not  to become involved with a poor boy, represents the world of success,  happiness, freedom and wealth to which Clyde desperately aspires. Sondra is  the answer to Clyde's dreams, she is, as Dreiser puts it, a girl with  everything asking Clyde for nothing, and Roberta is a girl with nothing  asking Clyde for everything-not least among these things is marriage. The  only solution Clyde's young mind concocts is murder-yes, murder. He takes  Roberta out on a boat and causes her to drown, but he leaves a trail of  suspicious clues behind, and after an emotional and perhaps unfair trial,  he is sentenced to death at 21 years of age.<br />Thus, Clyde is so  star-struck by the attraction of Sondra and her comfortable world that he  sacrifices his life in pursuit of it. An American Tragedy is as emotionally  difficult to endure as King Lear or Othello. Dreiser is not kidding; this  is most certainly a tragedy in its most severe and harrowing form. An  American tragedy stands as an American masterpiece along with such epics as  Grapes of Wrath, Patterson or Howl. It is difficult to think that even one  reader would not come away from this book without a more compassionate  heartunfair trial,  he is sentenced to death at 21 years of age. <br />Thus, Clyde is so  star-struck by the attraction of Sondra and her comfortable world that he  sacrifices his life in pursuit of it.

That is what Alan Lightman asks. most of us will glance at our watch and carry on, lightman takes us inside the clocks on our wrists, towers and desks and  forces us to see over 30 different dimensions in which time is, as Lightman  puts it, a bodily time, not a mechanical time. Time has nothing to do with  6:30 am or time for lunch, and everything to do with the loves of our lives  coming just around the corner to meet us for the first time, and first  kisses, and death, desire, pain, joy. Lightman fascinatingly blames time  for nearly every circumstance we encounter in our daily lives, and shows  that if it weren't for this man-made thing, &quot;time,&quot; our  understanding of life and the world would be universally different.  Einstein's Dreams is a downright frightening work of genius, and the  beautiful simplicity of Lightman's writing style begs for a second or even  third read.	2000-06-13
US	52095883	R1A1GQLVQQ1X24	1854592610	879510635	The Seagull	Books	5	9	11	N	N	Universal	Everyone, whether we like to admit it or not, wants nothing more than to lay on their deathbeds and be able to say &quot;I have led a beautiful life.&quot; This intense desire lives within us all. Sometimes it happens,  sometimes it causes us to worship other human beings as something more than  human, sometimes it destroys us.<br />In Chekov's The Seagull, the brilliant  playwright displays his passionate understanding of the desire that  wrestles with the human soul. Subtly complex, The Seagull is a play meant  to be read many times, and each time readers are bound to meet a different  facet of themselves in the play's characters and their quests to satiate  that voice within each of them, constantly whispering &quot;you need more,  more.&quot; It is a voice that leads one aspiring writer in the play to  suicide, and cuts off another's capacity to embrace anyone but himself and  his own entrapped mind.<br />Almost every facet of desire is explored here:  love, life, death, dreams of glory, success, achievement. And, as with our  very best playwrights, Chekov incorporates a masterful metaphor in his  Seagull, which tightly wraps the play in a bundle of genius. Like  Williams's breathtaking 'Night of The Iguana,&quot; and Ibsen's eerie 'The  Wild Duck,&quot; The Seagull blends tragedy and beauty in an unforgettably  delicate union. This is the kind of play that will stick in readers' minds  for a lifetime.	2000-06-10

That is what Masters offers us with his biting, poetic vision of the human experience. Many poems, all of which are delightfully concise,  often conclude with proverbs that rival those of the Bible itself.  &quot;This is life's sorrow,&quot; he writes in &quot;Herbert  Marshal,&quot; &quot;That one can be happy only where two are/And that our  hearts are drawn to stars/which want us not.&quot; Masters, perhaps  unknowingly, includes occasional glimpses of eastern philosophy as well,  such as in &quot;Griffy The Cooper,&quot; in which he writes, &quot;You are  submerged in the tub of yourself/Taboos and rules and appearances/Are the  Staves of your tub/Break them and dispel the witchcraft/Of thinking your  tub is life/And that you know life!&quot; The essence of Taoism or Buddhism  is hidden within the little tightly woven masterpieces of this poetry  collection.

The play did little for me and I knew this had to be the result of my inattentive reading, because no Tennessee  Williams play has ever failed to effect me in some way. Upon a second  reading, I was immediately struck by the play's powerful nostalgia, almost  frighteningly true insights and Wiliams's mastery of universal language.  This is when I knew I was reading a play by the great Tennessee Williams.  Much like Chekov, the play has little to do with plot. Victims of  Hollywood's endless catalog of films void of subtlety, which spare  audiences any thought by saying everything for them, are unlikely to enjoy  this play. &quot;Something Cloudy, Something Clear&quot; is an opportunity  to take a tour through a great playwright's life and read his welocme  observations which unexpectedly leap out of the dialogue. But  &quot;Something Cloudy, Soemthing Clear&quot; is not exclusively  autobiographical, it speaks for us all. We all have moments in which we  recall certain portions of our lives with surprising clarity. &quot;[Life]  finally seems to occur all at one time,&quot; as the play's main character,  August, tells us. Looking back on those times, we are often better able to  understand ourselves and the human experience, As Wiliams appears to have  accomplished in writing this play. Written at the end of his life,  &quot;Something Cloudy, Something Clear&quot; is a fitting epitaph to one  man's relentless attempt to understand the human experience, and with plays  such as this, Williams was kind enough to let us peak in at his thoughts  along the way. Thank you, Tennessee.	2000-05-02

Although the book is somewhat fast paced and races over portions of  Williamss life, it is meticulously researched and digs up every facet of  Tennessee Williams. Spoto reveals the glory days of the pulitzer prize  winning playwright and the nightmare of his last two decades in which he  watched success wane as fastidious critics, ignorantly demanding that  Williams continue to deliver plays in the vein of Glass Menagerie and  Streetcar Named desire, beat him literally to death. One must have emotions  of steel to get through the book's later chapters, in which Williams  suffers a miserable descent into drug addiction and madness. Despite  Williams's wealth and fame, the man lived a terribly difficult life. From  his chaotic childhood to his drugged, alcoholic and lonely end, Williams's  life was perhaps his greatest drama, as Spoto reveals.	2000-04-28

Beautifully written, passionate and insightful, this is the work of one of the finest unknown authors of the 20th century. Camon's intense narrative bears stunning similarities to the  brilliant existential writings of Albert Camus, while the story reaches a  desperate crescendo that leaves its stamp on the mind long after finishing  the book. Camon's musings on death, his perspectives on Italy's waning  peasant culture and his uncanny knack for painting landscapes and  cultivating real emotions from the characters is the stuff of pure pathos  and beauty. It is indeed a &quot;memorial&quot; of the author's mother, of  whom he offers nostalgic, riveting remembrances. Everything from humorous  accounts of her bland cooking to her daily struggle to keep a peasant  family alive and stable exhibits the heroic and essential role of the  mother in any family. Also, her elderly husband's determination to fight  through the pain of his aged body and construct a magnificent Altar in  tribute to his deceased wife is nothing short of saintly. This book has the  rare ability to pierce readers' hearts, most of whom will undeniably come  away from the book with a deeper,tenderer love of their families-if nothing  more. From the first word to the last, there is no doubt that this is the  voice of a master writer still waiting to be discovered by the world. With  hope, that day will come.	2000-04-27

One need not be religious to grasp or identify with this brilliant work. <br />This book is held together by Christ's beatitudes, parables and prayers as a way  of emphasizing the need for spirituality, not organized religion, in our  lives. Weil insists on vital obligations of the soul (all of which are  explained in brief detail) and the importance of spirituality and  self-respect in all things. <br />According to Weil, everything we do is to be  approached with the same intense religiosity that pervaded ancient Greek  culture. Love of money and glory have buried spirituality in modern  societies world-wide. One of Weil's many solutions was to completely  reexamine the uses of education in order to instill this spiritual  understanding of human existence. <br />As with all great thinkers, there are  countless facets of Weil's thought. The Need For Roots, therefore, is not  an easy read. I found myself reading over sentences and paragraphs several  times-not out of frustration, but out of an imense craving to fully  understand the saintly beauty of her words.<br />Those who make the effort to  read this book attentively will come away with a powerful, fresh  perspective of life, including an understanding of the necessity of both  joy and pain.

She despises group thought, i.e., organized religion, while constantly  referencing the words of Jesus Christ as being the essence of Christianity  and a crucial model for living a &quot;well-rooted&quot; life.<br />One need  not be religious at all to identify with the type of religiosity expressed  in this book. Simone Weil is no preacher. Going to church every Sunday does  not impress her. Dropping money in the priest's basket does not impress  her. Love, on the other hand, does. And not just love of God or of  religion, but love of eveything we do in life. She stresses the need for  love of truth, learning, physical labor and love for what she defines as  &quot;the good.&quot;<br />Religion, for Simone Weil, should not just be  limited to the church. Simone Weil believes that every aspect of life,  everything we do, such as the pursuit of science or knowledge, should be as  religious an experience as it was for the ancient Greeks; a civilization  she draws reference to many times throughout the book.<br />Her deep  spirituality is strewn throughout these pages, and wakes up the mind to the  hypocrissy, spiritual crisis, and moral &quot;uprootedness&quot; of human  nature in the modern world. In the midst of stressing this deeply spiritual  message, Simone Weil attempts to open the reader's eyes to newer, less  narrow-minded definitions of patriotism and greatness, as well as noting  the various fundamental uses of education. For Simone Weil, education is  not just a kid going to school and trying to get a good grade. Education is  for those who have a love of truth, a love of knowledge and an  understanding of the importance those virtues carry. It is up to a  well-rooted, healthy society to instill those virtues in each  individual.<br />Like the works of most complicated thinkers, this is no easy  read. There are many different ideas spiraling around the core of  spiritualism emphasized in &quot;The Need For Roots.&quot; Simone Weil is  extremely intellectual. It is unthinkable that she attained this level of  brilliance by the time of her premature death at the age of 33. Most people  will find themselves reading over paragraphs several times before fully  understanding them. In the introduction, T.S. Elliot suggests that one  reading of the book is insufficient, and he may be correct. Anyone who  thinks they have grasped this book fully after reading over it once is  either lazy, or, if they are correct, a freak of nature. However, the hard  work required to tap into Simone Weil's stream of thought is well worth it.  This is truly one of the most inspiring and provocative books I have read.  While it was written in 1943 and adressed specifically to the state of  France under the Vichy government, much of this book still remains  crucially relevant today, perhaps even more so.<br />If this book is read  with discernment, rather than in the casual mode in which we often read, I  guarantee that a permanent tatoo of Weil's deep passion for humanity will  be left on the soul.ifferent ideas spiraling around the core of  spiritualism emphasized in &quot;The Need For Roots.&quot; Simone Weil is  extremely intellectual.

It is a collection of simple but no less meaningful poems inspired by Bly's interest in Toaism. If you have tried to  read some of the popular Toaist texts, such as the writings of Loa-Tzu, and  felt as if it went over your head, this is the book for you.<br />But These  poems are not restricted to an exploration of Toaism, they also redefine  solitude. Bly transforms solitude into a glorious, desirable experience,  rather than the miserable affliction that the word has come to represent  today in the minds of most people. The truth is that solitude is an  essential food for poets, and &quot;Jumping Out of Bed&quot; could not have  been written unless Bly had tasted solitude.<br />The subtlty and depth with  which he explores the simple (often overlooked) pleasures of being is well  appreciated. Also, the &quot;woodcuts&quot; by Wang Hui-Ming not only make  the book beautiful, they offer a freshness not found in most books of  poetry. Too often, a book of poems is just a boring display of black words  on white page after white page. Wang Hui-Ming takes this book to a  different level. If you enjoy Bly's poetry and do not have this book, get  it. If you want a book of poetry free of confessional or  self-congratulatory muck and full of importance, this is for you.<br />By the  way, if you ever have the opportunity of seeing Robert Bly read in person,  DO IT! He's fantastic.	2000-01-26
