However, I found the narrative and the pace of the book not cohesive or enticing at all.  At times, I read with great interest, at times I felt bored and felt the author was using the story to inflate her intellectual ego.  The girls in her class were like ghosts that at times almost became human but never quite did.  This could be because of the author's care in protecting identities but it did detract from the story.  There was so much untapped emotion and impact behind their stories that was not fully presented.  I expected much more from this memoir.	2005-06-15

It is that forgettable.  The story is not new nor refreshing.  The story starts interesting enough and the narrative style is very clever. It keeps you glued to the book to figure out how all the loose ends tie up.  But soon it loses its spark and resorts to the main themes of so much contemporary American literature: dysfunctional childhoods, lack of responsbile parent figures, unstable adults that get into trouble and then \\"redeem\\" themselves. I found Jonah unlikable, in spite of his disfigurement.  I am a very sensistive and tolerant person and worked very hard to try to warm up to him.  It just did not happen.  Plus the kidnapping episode is really creepy and pointless.  It makes him even less likable. Troy is much more multi-dimensional and he helped me get through the book.  But I kept thinking: \\"It's time for these guys to grow up!\\".  Life is difficult for most people (look around at our messed-up world outside the U.S.).  We live in a society where we focus on feeling sorry for reckless individuals and make excuses for when they behave badly versus helping them become accountable for their actions and grateful for the things they DO have.  Books like this one perpetuate the \\"poor me\\" mentality that is so pervasive and self-defeating in many aspects of our society.	2005-05-13

The story is contrived, boring and repetitive. It does have some very funny and touching moments but they get lost in the more unsiginificant events intertwined in the narrative.  It is full of one-dimensional, stereotyped characters.  There is nothing new nor refreshing in this book that merits the high praise it has received.  We've seen these type of stories in many other books so there is no uniqueness in it.	2005-05-13

In the midst of all the modern, existential, repetitive, trendy, lackluster American literature we read these days, Saffran Foer's novel is a shining star.  He is beyond comparison. How can anyone take such devastating subjects as 911, the death of a parent, a WWII bombing and web them into a beautiful and meaningful story? And he does it with great imagination, humor, compassion and sincerity.  He does not sanitize feelings nor events and the result is a gut-wrenching, thought-provoking book.  Oskar is a character I will never forget.   We all have a little bit of him in us.	2005-05-04

Sin embargo, la narrativa a veces no fluye muy bien y es dificil captar la esencia de los dos personajes principales, Violetta y Pig.  Al final, no hay duda de quien y que Violetta es, pero no pude deshacerme de la pena que le tome al leer lo triste y deprimente que su vida fue.  El autor narra muchas veces a traves del libro los ataques de llantos severos que consumian a Violetta al contemplar el tremendo fracaso que es su vida.  Una persona de verdad \\"mala\\" y sin consciencia jamas hubiera sufrido de tal manera.  Por eso no me pude convecer 100% de su comportamiento.  El personaje de Pig es mas complicado pero no nos es presentado tan claramente como el de Violetta.  Al final senti una ambiguedad por su personaje que me hubiera gustado resolver.  O tambien puede ser que ese haya sido el proposito del autor al desarrollar sus personajes.	2005-04-19

What was it like to live during that time period? What was it like to live in such a God-fearing, histerical, fanatical society? (We can can argue that many people still live in such an environment).  What was it like to be a woman with no choices or capabilities to choose her own future?  What was it like to be ill in a time with rudimentary medicine, at best?  Etc, etc.  What won me about it is how the author creates a feminist story for its time where triumph and survival are defined much different than in modern times.  Who cares about historical inaccuracies?  It is a work of fiction and it must be enjoyed as so.	2005-01-25

At times too corny and over-emotional (the poetry), at times too vulgar and graphic for my taste (like the way his goatee smelled after sex) but a true masterpiece of what it means to be a black man in America these days. It was a great learning experience that will only teach tolerance and understanding in between all races. I am of Latin origin and feel that our feelings and challenges as a culture are often misunderstood.  Overall, I thought it was an average book, but a must-read to increase the understanding of the reality of the African-American community in the America.	2004-07-16

I kept reading on a fast pace, waiting for the great &quot;tragedies&quot; to reveal themselves and in the end it was nothing more than run-of-the-mill family conflicts and regrets.  We all have &quot;tragedies&quot; like that in our families.  It is almost insulting, you keep feeling that the author exaggerates so much, while waiting for the story line to deliver a punch.  She should have taken a deeper look at the sad and frequent tragedies that a lot of families deal with before writing such an ambitious book. It was very dissappointing.	2004-07-16

I could not help but thinking how would I feel if, as a little girl, I would have been torn away from my culture and my recently-deceased parents' world to live with relatives in an unknown, mysterious place on the other side of the planet. That is how much impact the book has-- you feel the pain, love and feelings constrained by cultural norms that every character is burdened by.  What is wrong and what is right takes many different meanings.  The book makes you reconsider values that are culturally accepted but that go against the human spirit.  How hearbreaking it must be for a parent to cut all ties with a beloved child because of a marriage against his/her wishes?  As a reader, you can't stop thinking about that either.	2004-05-21

It is not overly ambitious but the author suceeeds in creating a story that draws you in and makes you reflect.  It takes courage and skill for a writer to develop serious weaknesses in a character and still have the readers feel compassion for him or her.  In most of these situations, I come to dislike the character. But not in this book. Everyone we meet is multi-dimensional and full of complex baggage.  They are just trying to survive and find meaning in a cruel and unfair world.  But at the end, the book is all about redemption and new opportunities in life no matter how far a person has fallen.

The characters are full of flaws and struggles, just like we all are. That is why everyone is so likeable.  It is very rare to find women characters in modern ficition that are strong without being obnoxious or unlikeable.  The description of Maddie's illness and treatment is so palpable and realistic it is hard not to think about it constantly.  Few books can merge so much successfully.  However, I feel the book was just cut short at the end and finished too abruptly. I am not sure what I was expecting but I was hoping for a more conclusive ending given the tone and pace set early in the book.	2004-05-10

Some of them are more interesting than others but in general, they make the reader think about a vast set of idea without trying to change his or her opinion.  It is written with a lot of skill.  As far as the criticism in other reviews regarding &quot;attacks on God&quot; and &quot;calling people that believe in God uneducated&quot;, reader beware!  The author is not directly attacking God nor doubting his existence but rather pinpoints institutionalized religion, which in my opinion IS one of the roots of evil in the world right now. Al-Qaeda?  Extreme Islam?  Child molesting by Catholic priests?  Jews and Palestines killing each other mercilessly?  Bush's conservative and discriminatory Christian-right agenda?  Need I say more???<br />I could go on and on about all the thoughts and ideas this book provokes.  Without a doubt, the essay on MEAT is the most powerful one.  It presents many ugly realities that we choose not to see. Read this book and let yourself be compelled to think alternatively about life's issues.	2004-01-27

It is not only a chronicle of an undying, yet impossible love but it also presents a crisp picture of 18th century Venice with all its charm and outdated aristocracy.  The book is so bittersweet...in spite of the pureness and greatness of their love it is so heart-wrenching to see them forced to live separate lives by an inflexible and archaic social system.  Maybe they have found themselves again in a subsequent life and have had the chance to be together and fulfill their interrupted love story.	2004-01-26

It is well-written and so clear that you can feel and see the places, people, events and emotions.  It is so full of familial love in spite of the imperfections of human lives.  The characters are interesting and well-developed. However, I felt like there were some loose ends or plot twists that needed to be tied up to give the story more sense and depth.  The character of Fern comes to mind.  She pops up at the end in an almost unbelievable turn of events and her story takes away from the focus on the family.  Also, Maureen's love affair with the neighbor should have been addressed in more detail to feel better the impact on the members of the family.  I felt like there was too much implied in the relationship between the parents and not enough presented in detail.  Besides being confusing, it contributes to an overall lack of depth.  On the other side, the friendship between Fenno and Mal is so beautifully presented and developed.  It is one of the most outstanding parts of the book.  I wish that all the relationships in the book were developed like theirs.  That would have made the book entirely unforgettable.	2004-01-04

It suceeds, overall.  It is terribly entertaining although it can be confusing at times.  It is hard to keep precise track of what happened in Henry's life at different ages and that is very important to fully understand the book.  I had to keep going back to earlier chapters to understand clearly.<br />My main objection to the plot (and therefore I give it 4 stars) is how poorly developed and irrelevant some of the secondary characters became.  First, Gomez. What really happened between he and Clare?  What were her feelings for him? Then Kimy.  She seems like such a strong female presence but is relegated to a very cookie-cutter role.  What about Clare's brother Mark and his wife Sharon?  They are mentioned throughout the years (along with their children) but we never really now much about what happened after they got married.  I could go on and on. Of all of them, the most intriguing was Ingrid.  I think the story could have benefited from a more detailed look at her and the misery that led her to suicide. I think a more detailed approach to some of these characters would have enriched the story without taking away the impact and relevance of the relationship between Henry and Clare.<br />All in all, it was a good read. But it had the potential to be an unforgettable experience.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, it falls short of that.	2003-12-21

If one pays careful attention to the details and style of the writer, you discover how he gives glimpses into Sugar, Sophie and William's fate throughout the book.

It is a good read for a beach day and it is mostly enjoyable with that perspective. However, there are many serious flaws in the book that worry me. First, it is very hard to distinguish fact from fiction for the un-initiated in Da Vinci's work, religious sects, etc.  It can lead to dangerous conclusions in people that &quot;read but don't question&quot; modern fiction.  Second, I found the book annoying at times in its use of simplistic language. Its' stupid comnments (mostly Langdon's thoughts) insult the average intellect and cheapen the book.  Who cannot read the part about Langdon wondering if the inside of the Zurich Depository was &quot;decorated by Allied Steel&quot; and feel how senseless and idiotic that thought is?  The story line is entertaining and thought-provoking but no more than the average thriller out there.  One good outcome, at least for me, is the desire to search for the historical truth regarding all the controversial subjects presented and come to my own informed conclusions.	2003-10-23

But it fails terribly as the plots narrows down to the life of self-pity that Lucy forces on herself because of her guilt. At some point, it turns from noble to ridiculous.

The story of family intrigue, farm life and WWI America has been told many times in different ways, some which are more effective and impacting. Frankly, I did not find this book to be innovative or unique. It is a great attempt for someone learning how to become a writer. But it dissappoints the well-read person.  It would be a good book to read on the beach during summertime but that is all it's worth for.	2003-02-13

This book is so true to the era, the music, the expressions, the drugs and the parties.  The fact that Kevin is a gay teenager adds even more complicated dimensions to the already complicated task of growing up in a dysfunctional household.  This book will touch you without being sentimental or full of cliches. The humor is just right, even in the midst of serious issues.  It also gives a voice to gay teenagers all over the world, who struggle with the same issues that straight kids deal with and then more.  A great read!	2003-02-09

Not only it is written at a 4th-grade reading level (what's up with the overuse of exclamation signs, like an eager child?) but it tries to portray the whole family as perfect and above all because they don't let tragedies ruin their faith and determination to go on.  Let's be real! I may be a Christian, but I took offense at how her own interpretation of the scriptures is the \\"right\\" interpretation.  Nobody should try to impose their faith on others so righteously. I respect her tremendously and suffer for her children but I would have respected her a lot more if she would have kept her ordeal private after the dust settled (after all, didn't she do a zillion interviews?)   Nobody deserves to suffer but we are all human and can grieve in many different ways.  We can all falter and sink into deep depressions after such tragedies and that does not make us worse human beigns. She made us all feel inadequate with her portrayal of her grief. I found it annoying and self-serving.  The only true human spirit in this story is Todd.  May he rest in peace.	2002-09-18

I started reading this book eagerly and somehow I lost a bit of interest as it entered its mid-point. I stuck with it and later got mad at myself for having ever doubted how wonderful it is and not having paid much attention to some significant details. I did go back and started re-reading it and was not dissapointed. The purity of love that shines through this novel takes your breath away. The narrative is so clear and crisp (and I am not a native English speaker). You live every event vividly, and at times, painfully. It once more reminds you that life does not need to be perfect and that we need to love and support our dear ones in spite of their actions. And that can be very, very difficult at times.	2002-09-13

Mucho se ha escrito con respecto al amor -- que es, cual es el verdadero, como sobrevive a traves de los aos y como nos transforma como persona.  Este libro logra lo que ningun otro en su genero-- nos presenta el amor con un sentimiento de muchas facetas, del cual a veces no se esta completamente seguro y el cual sobrevive cualquier percance en la vida.  Cada personaje nos demuestra su lucha interior contra las diferentes experiencias que el amar nos trae.  Pero tambien nos demuestra que es realmente posible el amar puramente y con paciencia hasta lograr nuestro ideal.  Este libro es una joya. Jamas lo olvidare. Me hizo refleccionar mucho en mi propio matrimonio.	2002-08-26

It attempts a lot but succeeds in nothing. Maybe it is a reflection of our times? I found myself truly disliking all characters, feeling no understanding towards them and being totally annoyed at their *mis*adventures.  How boring!  All you have to do is look in your neighborhood (or your own family) for people like this-- not a new story and nothing to be learned nor gained by reading about it.  This book truly fails to soar over every-day family disfunction into something that is worth remembering.	2002-07-24

However, I feel that underneath the whole kidnapping ordeal was even a deeper story that was going to come out at any moment. What a wasted potential! The book stays pretty much at a superfluous level most of the time. It almost insults an adult's intelligence. It had so much potential but the author never took the time to dig deep and thus delivered a poorly developed story.  It was a light, summer read until the end. It was really dissapointing and did not make any sense given the events. This is the major flaw of the book-- the author did not set the stage, even subtlely for the ridiculous ending.	2002-07-01

This book holds a lot of promise with its intrigue and plot twists.  But it fails to deliver a big impact consistently. Even though it is exceptionally written, it wanders too much, particularly in the middle.  James is too much of a one-sided character. He is a sick, unlikable man and it is hard to read and accept the tragedies he brings to his daughters.  I found it disturbing but just for the sake of it. It deals with the horrors of incest in a cliche way-- makes you feel very impatient and disgusted without any hope for redemption. The outlook of the book was not fresh nor unique.  It just blends with mediocre literature.	2002-07-01

For starters, it exposes the reader to the mechanics of the slave trade with grueling and objective detail.  Then, it unfolds as the ultimate moral story.  It truly shows the struggle between good and evil in the human heart and the possible catastrophic outcomes of our decisions.  The reader becomes totally involved in the era and the moral dilemmas that existed at the time. I read the book about 3 years ago and it still stays with me.	2002-07-01

A greatly told-story, a fabulous exposure to life and culture in India and a saddening and realistic exposure to the tragic turns of life for many of its citizens.  I was fascinated by the historic perspective, the clarity of the descriptions and the stressful, sometimes desperate lives of its main characters. The book is hard to take and it affects the reader tremendously.  So, it may take a while to finish it but every word is worth the agony of watching the characters' lives unfold the way they did.  Lastly, Mistry's use of humor in the midst of such wretched situations is truly superb. I have rarely read a book that accomplishes so much in so many fronts. Unforgettable and a sad awakening to the reality of millions of citizens in India.	2002-06-23

This book starts off really promising, interesting and off-beat.  But half way into the story it looses its zest.  Too many complicated characters that are not fully explored show up. Too many story lines and issues that never get addressed fully.  The last part of the book becomes quite boring and disoriented. It is a great story but I think the author was too ambituous in its scope and therefore ended up with many half-told stories.  The only story that comes to somewhat of a closure was that of Agens/Father Damien. The rest of the characters remain in limbo.  It was a dissappointing read after such a great start.  I had a hard time keeping up the interest to finish it up.	2002-06-20

It shows the dark side of humans but it has so much redemption and beauty in it, it lifts you up in the end. To me the most unforgettable character is Muffin, Marianne's cat.

Love, war, humor, cultutal idiosincracies, hate, homosexuality, hope, history and  survival.  Very few authors and books have accomplished the merging of such  powerful and contradictory experiences in such a deep and thoughtful  manner.

Most of all, it is all about hope and the permanence of  real love in an uncertain and changing world.	1999-08-16
