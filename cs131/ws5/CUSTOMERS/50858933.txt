US	50858933	R1LW2N0Y2U3KV	1560062703	107497855	The Dred Scott Decision (Famous Trials)	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Simple and To the Point	The vocabulary level of the book shows this is not necessarily a children's book, but then it is not strictly a scholarly tome.  This is part of a larger series called The Famous Trials Series.  The book contains a little over 80 pages of text and pictures as well as an annotated bibliography of sources used and recommended reading. <br /> <br />The author explains the context of the Scott v. Sandford decision both historically and judicially.  She explains how the case worked its way through the Missouri state courts, then into the federal courts.  In each instance, the author explains the arguments being made as well as the court's decision. <br /> <br />Throughout the book, the author includes pictures of some of the main players, such as Chief Justice Taney, and historical images.  The historical images include posters from the era concerning abolitionist political rallies.  Although the size of the print makes it a little difficult to read the poster reproductions, they are legible and add to the understanding of the times. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book as a quick review of the trial. <br />	2005-09-27

After many years, Robert Carter has shared his perspective with us. <br /> <br />Tales from Carter's childhood and schooling are simply stated.  Given the discrimination and hardship with which he grew up, these tales are more aptly labeled, \\"simply understated.  His accomplishments through adversity are clearly laudable, but we don't get all the detail we would hope for.  He does discuss a falling out between Marshall and him, and he also discusses grabs for power as Thurgood left.  However, we don't get this level of detail on the cases. <br /> <br />Regardless of the level of detail, this is a very informative read.  I would recommend that anyone wanting to know more about our continuing struggle with civil rights should read this book. <br />	2005-09-27

As the author points out, our investment in human intelligence has gone sour as politicization has hampered our efforts to make better decisions. <br /> <br />After reading of the many different incidents of inter-agency conflict, I am surprised that we are successful at all in intelligence.  The book gives specific incidents where case managers seem to have no qualms about trying to religiously convert their agents rather than do their jobs and get information.  We also read of replacements who can't speak the language of their assigned agents and of agencies fighting amongst themselves. <br /> <br />Baer does not give us specific steps to enhance our ability to obtain intelligence.  He does, however, give us some great examples of things we need to look into and fix if we expect to avoid terrorist attacks in the future.  I would recommend reading this book. <br />	2005-09-22

The former is merely a bit of an afterthought on the rest of the book, which goes into specific instances where intelligence went awry through misunderstanding or misuse. <br /> <br />I mention that these are some examples as Keegan doesn't feel that intelligence is what makes a victory.  Intelligence can be a big factor, but in the end, it comes down to strength.  Throughout the history of warfare, I don't know that all the instances of successful intelligence would have looked like a clearly won victory.   <br /> <br />As examples, we read of Trafalgar, the Battle of Crete, and the Battle of Midway, among other examples.  In these, we see that although a side how great intelligence, it didn't decide the battle in the end; it merely facilitates a more favorable confrontation.  As in the example of Crete, we see that having near complete knowledge of the enemy is not a guarantor of success. <br /> <br />A couple of examples, like the chapter on the Romans or the chapter on the German rocket program, do not give us a traditional battle, but show us how helpful or flawed intelligence gathering can be.  In the latter example, if personal pride had not gotten in the way, the rocket program could have been dealt with sooner. <br /> <br />This is an interesting read, and I would recommend it. <br />	2005-09-22

As I read through the different scenarios, I couldn't help but look back over my days in business to see if I had been duped into giving out information I shouldn't have. <br /> <br />The author walks you through several situations, such as a private investigator looking for hidden assets, a corporate spy looking for industrial secrets, or hackers looking for fun.  In each of the chapters, he gives the reader an example of the con, then explain how the con works.  Although he does leave some of the steps out (to prevent this from being a self-help book for hackers), he does give the reader enough information to see how this could happen. <br /> <br />The end of the book is intended as a checklist for all businesses.  Even though a true hacker or social engineer (the difference is explained in the book) could still get through, all businesses should look at the list to ensure that they have done everything they could to prevent a security breach.  In a nutshell, the biggest thing businesses can do is educate all employees, because humans are the weakest link in security. <br /> <br />For formatting, the author includes quick notes throughout the book.  These get a bit monotonous after a while as the information in the note is already on the page in the text itself.  It seems a bit repetitive.  In all, however, this is a very informative book. <br />	2005-06-20
US	50858933	R2IC1AIU7CSMSH	1586482491	236101738	Masters of Chaos: The Secret History of the Special Forces	Books	4	3	4	N	N	Not just blowing stuff up	When we think of Special Forces, the images that leap into mind are usually high-energy gun battles, explosions all around, and a massive body count.  We think of Rambo.  These images of holiday are largely misleading, and this book will show the reader how the Special Forces are a lot more powerful than we thought. <br /> <br />The first thing I learned from this book is that brains are much more valuable than brawn.  Although it doesn't go into much detail on training, members of the Special Forces work on learning diverse languages and cultures to best fit the environment they are going into.  Being prepared to fight anywhere at anytime is part of it, but knowing how to get things done and how to work with and understand the locale are much more important.  I have a newfound respect for these men. <br /> <br />The book primarily discusses their work in and around Iraq, during both wars, but it also discusses Panama, Afghanistan, the Balkans, and Somalia.  Each location brought its own concerns, and the soldiers of the Special Forces rose to the challenge.  The author allows the reader to meet key characters, which allows the reader to better follow the narrative. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand the Green Berets. <br />	2005-01-18

Books	4	2	2	N	N	Read this before taking the exam	Professor Whitebread has been teaching for a long time, and of course, he has been to law school as a student.  These simple tips will help you prepare to write a better exam answer.  These simple tips will also make the difference is how you finish in the class. <br /> <br />His main idea is to apportion your time.  Although this seems to go without saying, students still run out of time and neglect to answer all the questions.  This is probably the biggest problem students have.  From the book, and from my experience, be sure you strictly adhere to the time you set aside. <br /> <br />The professor also discusses what kind of answers you will want to avoid, which is why I wrote the subject line I did here.  I made the mistake of reading the book after my exams and realized that I should have rephrased some of my answers.  Policy reasons are a necessity in any answer, but the answer must avoid sounding conclusory.  The reason for an exam is to explain your answer and show your work, not state what you think is obvious. <br /> <br />I would recommend reading this before going into finals and recommend rereading it before the next set of finals. <br />	2005-01-18
US	50858933	R1KZUOL3TS7B97	0743244974	154204855	Four Trials	Books	3	12	22	N	N	Not your typical political autobiography	The author divides the book into four sections, which basically correspond to trials that impacted John Edwards as lead litigator the most.  Each case deals with an individual or family, represented by Edwards, went against a large company or organization.  Although we learn a bit about legal practices and learn a bit of the background on the case, the narrative is designed to help us see Edwards' reaction to the trial rather than see how the legal process works.<br />Interspersed in the narrative is information about Edwards, such as his marriage to his wife, a little about his childhood, and a bit about starting his own firm.  These provide the readers with some perspective on Edwards in how he relates to cases and a bit on who he is, but they do not give a lot of insight into his politics, which may be by design.<br />Only one or two comments about the government is listed, which leads me to believe this wasn't intended to be political.  However, given his run for the Democratic nomination for President, the book doesn't give me a clear idea of what he would support, although I do know what kind of man he is.<br />This is an interesting insight and a bit of alternative perspective to the typical political autobiography.  Given the strength of his run for the nomination, I would recommend reading this, as he will probably be back.	2004-04-29

The book was very readable and showed the outcome is similar, but the perspective and approach is different.<br />The most enlightening is that the &quot;for-profit&quot; university is not a new idea, as Ruch traces early examples back into the early days of America and in Europe.  <br />Also enlightening is the new trend of traditional universities using extension services to bring in money to the university as a for-profit branch of the school.<br />I did notice at least one error in the information.  When discussing the faculty salary at one of the for-profits, I found that we overstated it by about $400-500.  As a faculty member of over six years for the school, I can vouch that we have never made that much, not even with a doctorate degree.<br />Overall, I would recommend reading this just to see that the schools are not as different as they think they are.	2004-04-18

I love the music of Sting and was looking forward to hearing about the man who created it and how the music was created.  Unfortunately, the readers get some interesting information, but they do not get the whole story.<br />The book begins with Sting and his wife, Trudie, in Brazil taking part of a religious ceremony where some kind of psychedelic plant has been taken.  In taking this plant, Sting is taking back into his memories, which leads the reader into Sting's past.  As a literary tool, this is interesting.<br />We learn about Sting's troubled childhood as well as his journeyman years as a musician.  This was very enlightening and really gave me an idea of who the musician is.  However, as a fan since the 80s, I would like to have read more about his time with The Police.  This part doesn't come until the last pages of the book and is not particularly enlightening.  This part reads as the climax of his career, although I know his career doesn't end there.<br />Although the book talks of Sting's first marriage and the first meeting with Trudie, the book does not go into the end of the first or the beginning of the second.  As this fits with the time of The Police, maybe we will get this in another book down the line.<br />Still, I would recommend this book for people who want to understand the man behind the musician and the musician behind the man.	2004-03-27

Although I found nothing of earth-shattering significance, the book did provide a bit more background for the themes covered in the political biography.<br />As Dean suddenly appeared on the presidential campaign radar, he evidently appeared on the Vermont political radar.  Leading up to his stints as governor, Dean was not widely known in his own state.  Politicians and reporters alike seemed caught unawares by this rise in the political ranks. <br />As governor, he received kudos and complaints.  This book provides some of the problems with getting particular legislation going and some of the fallout, which his book did not have.  The creation of civil unions legislation is one such example as is his environmental record.<br />This leads to my problem with the book.  The book's intent is to inform us about Dean rather than persuade us one way or the other.  In a few articles, the writer takes the time to quote as many pro-Dean people as anti-Dean people.  Even though I feel good about being empowered to choose my own path, I would like to have seen the writer's stance stated more aggressively.<br />I would recommend this book for those wanted to know a bit more about Dean or those who wish to \\"fill out\\" what they've read in the political biography.	2004-03-27

Questions like who yelled at who often arise.  However, as in the Star Trek Memories book before it, Bill Shatner does not dish out a lot of gossip or dirt on anyone.  Here, he discusses what went into getting the various projects to begin with.  Although this may not sound as exciting, I found myself turning pages, amazed that the films were actually made.  Roddenberry was not happy with his treatment, and the studio did not appear to want to work with anyone.<br />For the personal touch, Shatner begins by telling the readers what he was doing before he received the call for the first Star Trek motion picture.  From there, the stories tend to cover the people involved in writing the scripts, producing and directing the films, and getting the financing and actors.  For this, Shatner provides ample quotes from interviews and letters from the members involved.  As with the last book, he does interview Nimoy and Takei, but where are the comments from others?<br />A bit more personal is the information on Shatner's directing as well as his death scene in the crossover movie.  Although sentimental, he does not overdo it.<br />I would highly recommend this book to Star Trek fans.	2004-03-02

In American politics, the reader hopes for a middle-ground analysis but will oftentimes receive an argument from either the Left or the Right.  If you are not certain whether this text is from the right, then note that the author is the editor for National Review, and the book has praise from William F. Buckley Jr., Peggy Noonan, Michael Barone, and Rush Limbaugh.<br />Does this mean the book is biased?  Given that all books have some bias, yes.  This does not, however, mean the book is without merit.  A lot of research went into the text, and some of the material is taken from interviews and books by members of the Clinton team.  The information does look at errors of the Clinton legacy, which shows that the Clinton White House made mistakes.  I don't think any White House will be error free, which leads to the question of whether some of the claims are mere \\"armchair quarterback\\" remarks.<br />The main premise, in my opinion, is that Clinton's need to be liked caused a scandal to the office of the president and caused the laxity in our intelligence services, which led to the current trouble with terrorism.  The author does acknowledge that Republicans have a hand in this also.<br />Also, rather than taking a neutral stance, Lowry does have a very aggressive tone.  Although not a Republican, I thought he made some good points, even though his tone is a bit aggravating.<br />Lowry does highlight that people became obsessed with the sexual transgressions and acknowledges that this did distract.  As he pointed out, this is not uncommon in America.  He also highlights that the Republicans weren't always right, which I think adds some power to his argument.  Again, if his tone was more neutral, the argument would be more effective.<br />I would recommend this book to Democrats, Republicans, and independents.  There is nothing wrong with exposing your mind to the other side's argument.	2004-03-02

This confluence of roads was a pivotal logistic point as armies could then move men and materials about the area.  Understanding this, and seeing its declining position in the war, the Nazis were determined to take the road.  Having difficulty holding in the onrush, the US Army sends the 101st Airborne to hold the area.  This narrative discusses the Screaming Eagles part in the Battle of the Bulge.<br />As mentioned before, this is a narrative.  Donald Burgett was a private with the 101st during World War II and wrote his memories down soon after the war.  Since this is not a diary, he establishes a flow and understanding of what is going on in the area.  The narrative is very engaging.<br />Having been to visit the battle site as well as read other books and seen movies about the battle, I always wondered why the American soldiers were not properly outfitted to fight a prolonged engagement in the snow.  From this narrative, I learned that although they were short of some gear, the soldiers did have winter gear but were told to leave it behind because it would only slow them down.  <br />The soldier's perspective makes for a very good reading of the battle and its conditions.  I would recommend this to any fan of military history.	2004-02-22

The Ilse Witch had now renounced her evil ways and was going to fulfill her task of rebuilding the Druid Council.  Now, Terry Brooks has brought us the first book of the new series, \\"Jarka Ruus,\\" which begins the story of the new High Druid (the Ard Rhys), Grianne Ohmsford.<br />If you remember your Shannara history, then you are familiar with the Forbidding.  Due to a druid conspiracy, the Ard Rhys is banished to the Forbidding.  A dwarf named Tagwen, sworn to protect her, runs to find her brother to use the magic to save her.  As Tagwen finds out, her brother is away, and the conspirators are gaining on him.  With the help of a young Ohmsford, the Ard Rhys' nephew Pen, they make an escape in search of assistance to help the Ard Rhys.<br />Terry Brooks keeps more than one plotline going at any one time, but the pacing of the book keeps you turning pages, wanting to find out what happens next.  I would recommend reading this book and recommend taking a block of time to allow yourself the pleasure of reading it in one sitting.	2004-02-22

The input you have comes from sonar and the periscope.  Rather than give us another tale of submarine exploits, Mendenhall provides us with a war perspective from the men in the machine.  This is an interesting WWII narrative.<br />Rather than taking a retrospective look as an admiral (Mendenhall is a retired rear admiral), this narrative is taken from his diary from his submarine missions as a junior officer and an executive officer.  He discusses the routines and the fighting, as well as gives the sailors' perspective.  He also discusses the frustration felt by the crew as defective torpedoes missed easy targets.<br />Not only does he discuss the day-to-day life in the submarine, he also gives a tally of how the submarine did on each mission.  This was enlightening.  He also shares his concerns about his career and command in the Navy as the war was beginning to wind down.<br />I would recommend this book to WWII, Navy, and submarine buffs.	2004-02-22

Many books offer tips and tricks for taking notes, making outlines, and networking.  This book, however, offers a bit more background on the course of study.<br />The book contains individual essays from different teachers explain not what you should do, but why should do it.  For instance, one essay discusses gays and lesbians going to law school.  The essay mentions joining a society or group to help deal with the stress.  Being in law school already has its intense stress, so joining a club will allow some relaxation with others who share your background.  <br />The essay went on to discuss whether mentioning sexual preference is necessary or recommended.  Even for a non-gay or non-lesbian, this essay was really interesting.  The author has opened up my ideas to the kinds of issues any fellow students may be going through.<br />If you only get one book, this probably won't be the one to get.  However, I have to recommend this book highly.  I feel that I have a bigger overall picture what I would be getting into.	2004-02-13

From all my experience, I learned that not everyone liked William Shatner.<br />With that knowledge, I read the first couple of chapters with the voice of Shatner at the Star Trek convention lampooned by the SNL cast.  From the sound, Shatner still did not understand what the big commotion was for.  I fully believed that the rest of the book would be Shatner tooting his own horn.<br />The bulk of the book does not concern his specific recollections of the series, nor do most of the stories concern him.  The material primarily concerns how the show finally got on the air and how it made it through three seasons.  Although he did talk to some of the other cast members, the focus is more on the team behind the scenes.  He discusses Roddenberry and the other producers, directors, writers, lighting technicians, dolly grip, wardrobe designers, and set designers.  He gives the readers a very intriguing look at the people who helped get the series on the air and kept it going.  This book is more of a salute to those who made a quality product despite studio plans otherwise, such as cutting the budget and changing time slots.<br />Overall, the language was conversational and kept me engaged.<br />The final chapter does mention that he understands that some of the others do, or did, not care for him that much, and he also offers an olive branch out to James Doohan.  Given the year this was written (early 90s), I wonder if it was accepted.<br />I would recommend this book to fans of the show and other fans of 60s television.  The story behind the camera (rather than off) is an interesting one.	2004-02-03

Although the theories are straightforward for the scientist and enthusiast, the average reader may have difficulty following the terminology and statistics.  This narrative, however, makes the dinosaur legacy into an easy-to-follow story.<br />We follow the life of a female Utahraptor known as Raptor Red.  The author allows you to see and feel things from her perspective as he tells you about life in the time of the dinosaurs.  We read of the other dinosaurs and how they interacted with the raptors.  We follow Raptor Red on the hunt as well as courtship.  We also read of the smaller mammals as a foreshadowing of how the dominant species will change.<br />At no time does this book read like a textbook.  I would recommend this to anyone wanting to learn a bit more about our dinosaur predecessors.	2004-02-03

All the books here, Stunning Sentences, Powerful Paragraphs, and Riveting Reports, are essential for any writer's or student's desk.<br />The first part, Stunning Sentences, turns from the memorization of sentence forms and gives the readers many examples of ways to model their own sentences.  In the examples, Ross-Larson deftly shows the readers how the different sentence styles work and when they could best be used.  He also gives the readers an example with exemplary sentences so that readers can see how the sentences work in a larger context.<br />The second part, Powerful Paragraphs, shows the readers how paragraphs can be formed and used by the writer.  Different examples show how the topic sentence of the paragraph can be moved within the paragraph for effect.  As with the previous section of this book, the author gives us plenty of examples.<br />The third part, Riveting Reports, walks the readers through the writing process and shows the readers how they can slowly and steadily build a solid paper.  By showing these steps, the readers can eliminate a lot of stress by planning when these steps will be accomplished.  There is also a full example of a paper from start to finish.<br />In all, this is a very handy resource to have available to you.  Using this, and not just reading it, will provide you with great ideas in planning and writing.  This is a must-have.	2004-02-03

This book, which is more of a true companion, takes you from the beginning decision stage to the ending employment.  This book should not be out of reach of you are deciding or going to law school.<br />The book was put together by a team of recent law school graduates who have compiled success, and horror, stories, which are used to help the prospective law school student understand what is needed and why.  In regards to admission to law school, they also got some insight from faculty and admission staff.  The writing itself reflects this sense of someone on the inside telling us the scoop.<br />Without getting too bogged down in details, the writers bring tips for staying ahead of the game as well as tips for cutting losses.  They even give dates for when students should start preparing your resume and when they should send cover letters looking for summer employment.  <br />Although working on the law review is discussed, I found that little information, comparatively, was given for moot court.  This is a part of all law schools, so it seems odd that it is left out here.<br />I would recommend any one applying or attending law school to take a look at this.  This may be one of the most valuable resources outside of the Black's Law Dictionary.	2004-02-03

Although this does not sound like the typical Anne Rice book, this is a step into the other parts of traditional horror like her book on the mummy Ramses the Damned.  This is still a well done book with a great story behind it.<br />The story takes us back to the land of Babylon before the fall to Cyrus the Great.  A young man is sacrificed to keep the Jewish population from being killed, thereby allowing them to return and build their temple.  Due to an ancient spell, whoever controls his bones should control him.<br />The story is the connection and discussion between the spirit and a human.  The spirit merely wishes release, but the tale would go nowhere if others did have different plans.  This helps drive the narrative.<br />Anne Rice is a good storyteller of horror.  I liked the story and would recommend it to others.	2004-02-03

This book is his part of the story of the undersea missions during the Cold War.  For those looking for revealed secrets, you will disappointed because Craven understands the oaths he has taken so only mentions names when the person has already passed away.  He doesn't even approve or acknowledge other stories in print.<br />This text reads more as an autobiography than a telling of a good sea story.  He explains his role as the chief scientist and the roles others have had in helping to shape his career.  Not only does he discuss his work with special projects, but he also discusses his time as a professor in New England and Hawaii.  The telling is not so much a chronological exposition, but more of a man sitting back at the fireside telling us his stories from the past over coffee.  Each part of the story will interconnect with other chapters, but it will require a little work from the reader to remember.<br />Although no big secrets are revealed, this is an interesting read.  For instance, he discusses how the first space shuttle disaster could have been prevented from lessons that his team learned about materials and optimum temperatures decades before the disaster.  If science, engineering, and submarines are not your cup of tea, then I would recommend giving this one a skip.	2004-02-03

Not only does Rice consciously write about the things she has studied, but she subconsciously tells us about her life.<br />Ending just after \\"The Witching Hour\\" was published, this book is a little outdated.  The final words from the author discuss some of the projects that Anne Rice was working on.  From what is said here, Rice was not thinking about spending as much time with the vampires as she eventually did.  She also was thinking of returning to the mummy; however, I have yet to see this happen.<br />The text gives an account of Anne Rice's childhood and influences, her relationship and marriage to Stan Rice, her daughter who died of leukemia, and her son.  It also discusses some of the work she has done once she began to create a name for herself.  As mentioned, this isn't the meat of the text.<br />The meat of the text is in showing how she is resolving personal and subconscious issues in her writing.  She is also sharing her memories of New Orleans and San Francisco.  Many of her characters reflect herself and people in her life.<br />Although this is fascinating, it leads to a \\"bogging down.\\"  To ensure that the readers remember the characters, Ramsland provides long summaries of the key texts from this time, including the Anne Rampling and A.N. Roquelaure novels.  This disrupts the narrative and keeps the readers from truly connecting with the flow of Rice's life.<br />Nevertheless, I would recommend this book to young writers and fans of Anne Rice.	2004-02-03

Specific procedures for handling problems like Mad Cow Disease did not exist.  This narrative takes us through the cholera epidemic and allows us to see the egos in academia and science that hampered the containment and, ultimately, the understanding of the disease.<br />Starting in India during the days of the British Empire, an epidemic is beginning to make its rounds through the people.  With the increase in trade and travel, we follow the disease to the streets of London as it begins to wreak havoc upon the population.<br />The author does a great job in describing the epidemic as well as the government's denial that anything is really out of control.  Taylor gives us the different subplots, which enriches each character and lets us experience the personal agendas that drive them as well as the historic culture that holds them back.<br />I would recommend this book for readers of historical fiction concerning the Victorian era and readers wanting an accessible tale of epidemic	2004-02-03

For each side of the debate, we have to examine the evidence and support to decide if what we are reading is true.  This is especially true for the argument for or against the existence of UFOs.  This is an emotional argument for some, and this book purports to be the rational approach.<br />That being said, I thought this book would be an argument for belief in UFOs, alien abductions, and government cover-ups.  Admittedly, I based this on the cover of the book.  As I read, I realized that the cover was probably not chosen by the authors as the authors were against the belief.  So was I reading the rationalists' argument?<br />This is where I had trouble with the book.  I found the argument to be based on an \\"ad hominem\\" fallacy.  Rather than attack the argument, the book tends to attack the organizations, scholars, and believers of exterrestrial phenomena.  <br />This is not filled with bad information.  I found the insight into the organizations and believers to be interesting, but this book, by no means, establishes a solid stance against other-worldly happenings.	2004-01-31
US	50858933	R1YONXJFDA1GLU	0393325172	680723399	Master and Commander	Books	5	0	0	N	N	See where the magic begins	Something about teams beckons us and bids us join them.  Watching the connection and camaraderie instills in us a wish to become part of something like that.  Like Batman and Robin, Green Hornet and Cato, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Lucky Jack Aubrey and Doctor Maturin will become inseparable in our minds.<br />This is the first book of a series and now a movie.  We join the HMS Sophie as she continues to harass enemy shipping and trading as well as burn outposts throughout the Mediterranean. This is the first meeting of the team as Maturin signs on as the ship's physician. Not only do the captain, Jack Aubrey, and Maturin become a great team, but we watch the crew of the Sophie all build a bond that makes each member indiscernible from the others.<br />Going through the day-to-day life on the sea and joining in the battles with them, the author does a good job with pacing.  The reader easily feels that he or she is part of the action.<br />I highly recommend this book with the caveat that it is addictive.  You will find yourself looking for the other books of the series.	2004-01-31

This bullpen brought us over five Cy Young awards and a string of divisional championships.<br />My first thought was that this would be about the Braves.  Since this was not quite the case, I felt it would an autobiography about Tom Glavine.  Well, both of these are partly true, because the text is more of a series of reflections on his life and baseball.  Unfortunately, these reflections don't appear to be in any particular order, which can be confusing for the readers.<br />We learn about the seasons of the Braves going to the World Series and the one time they won.  We read about the strike year and hear it from the point of view of Glavine who was a spokesman for the players union.  Glavine shares his brief time in the minor leagues as well as his being drafted to play professional hockey.  There are even some stories about famous Atlanta Braves and other players, like when he was supposed to retaliate for a hit batsman, but had a bit of inner turmoil because he would have to plunk Dale Murphy.<br />Although the book could have gone through another edit, it does have some gems for baseball fans.	2004-01-31

What we see is a link, which can be connected with others in different directions.  From reading Taltos, we remember the characters from prior stories, and we can see where new links will be forthcoming.<br />The Taltos is a special being, and Rice brings us more than our share.  With the Mayfair witches, we have the beginnings of a new race of beings, which many are trying to control.  This book deals with the creation of a Taltos and the infighting that ensues from different factions trying to gain control.  This is where we learn about the Talamasca, which is a secret organization that is trying to understand and control the supernatural.<br />From the end of the book, the reader has no doubt that there will be a continuation of one or many of the storylines here.  Rather than feeling that the book is complete, the reader feels that he or she has merely held one link in a longer chain.  Rice's writing does keep you involved and eager for more.<br />I would recommend this for Anne Rice fans everywhere.	2004-01-31

By doing so, she points out that any attempt at governance will be met with fierce opposition from diverse groups that were, more or less, randomly placed together.  <br />The book begins with the creation of the state of Iraq, which I found is not an Iraqi creation.  The name is not even an Iraqi creation.  From the book, the British organized the areas of Basra, Baghdad, and Mosul into what we know of as Iraq.  Every leader since the creation of the state has struggled to build a state where all the different groups think of themselves as Iraqi.<br />Oil made the Iraqi state successful.  Saddam Hussein and his party moved in power to benefit from that wealth, but they realized quickly that for them to maintain control, they have to be ruthless.  Saddam has a long history of this.<br />After reading this book, the articles I read in the newspaper and the news segments I see on TV make more sense to me.  I would highly recommend reading this book.  This is a very enlightening read.	2003-05-21

Harry Bosch, an LAPD homicide detective, has been relieved of duty and must attend psychological evaluation sessions.  Through these sessions, we learn about how he got to this point, and we see the hint of what is to come.  Harry must deal with why he became a detective and what he hopes to accomplish before finding closure for his mother's death.<br />Michael Connelly, the author, has many balls in the air for Bosch to deal with.  Always in the back of the reader's mind, and Bosch's mind, are the many different things going on in his life.  Watching how Bosch deals with each one shows the author's skill in linking all the pieces together.  Parts of the plot may seem like deux et machina, but in review, Connelly had everything in mind all along.<br />There is a love interest for Bosch, but the character seems more like an afterthought.  Due to his brief association with her, more trouble brews for him at the police force.  It does seem a bit too contrived.  I was also expecting to get more from the psychologist, but that would have been too cliched.<br />I would recommend to fans of crime stories.	2003-04-03

The rift between the two worlds creates chaos, so all the heroes and anti-heroes must return to their own worlds.<br />A bit of disbelief suspension is always good, but I feel that this particular graphic novel never tries to explain the two worlds.  In one, good triumphs over evil, whereas evil holds sway in the other.  Human hearts appear on different sides of the body depending on which world you are.  This leads the reader to believe that the worlds are like mirror images.  This doesn't quite hold true since the Martian Manhunter and Aquaman don't have counterparts.  Although they don't choose to go to the other world, the writers never quite explain why.<br />In reading the story, I feel that the writers had some great ideas for this, but simply ran out of room.  The overall effect is that something important got left out.  I would recommend giving this one a skip.	2003-04-03

This is fiction, but woven throughout are allusions to English literature and culture.  Knowing these allusions clearly adds to the experience of the book.  <br />Some of the key characters of many Victorian adventure stories are gathered together to protect England from her enemies.  This first volume covers the gathering of its members and the first mission.<br />To get all the allusions, pay close attention to everything on the page.  References, names, and even background images in the pages have information for you to help set the tone.<br />This graphic novel includes a short story with Allan Quartermain in the end.  Although a good story, really good if you know your Lovecraft and remember John Carter of Mars, I believe it was originally done in serial.  Whenever you have a serial, there is some repetition to get everyone up to speed, kind of a \\"Last week on ....\\"  Since everything is together here, the repetition can be a little distracting.  It is an interesting story though.<br />I would highly recommend reading this.  I have been away from the comics scene, and this was a fabulous re-introduction into the genre.	2003-04-03

The ideas Chambers presents, like psychometry, bilocation, and spontaneous human combustion, will also be familiar.<br />The book is divided into different areas of the paranormal, and in each area, Chambers presents us with a figure of history who best exemplifies this area.  For instance, when talking of vampirism, he tells us of Arnold Paole, and when talking of cryptozoology, he tells us of Frank Hansen and the Minnesota Iceman.  In each area, a brief explanation of the phenomenon leads us into the presentation of each character.<br />With each character, we are not given a lot of information.  Basically, he tells us the story and then explains his thoughts and the thoughts of subsequent studies into the phenomenon.  The only problem is that some new characters are mentioned here, but never explained.  For instance, Uri Geller is mentioned a couple of times, but the reader is assumed to be already familiar with Uri.<br />This does not mean the book is without merit.  Chambers raises some very good points in the study of the paranormal.  The study is filled with extremists on both sides and these extremists prevent serious study from advancing.  For instance, if one fraud is found in levitation, the assumption becomes all levitation is fraudulent.  Likewise, if levitation is proved false in one instance, true believers claim that there is a conspiracy to keep levitation a secret from the people.  Chambers points out several cases where we should revisit the studies.<br />Although there are more books that go into more detail, I would recommend this book as a beginning study of the paranormal.  The bibliography in the back provides further reading.	2003-03-16

This biography, however, does not give the central focus to the writings and finds of Charles Darwin; the thesis deals more with Darwin being a possible hypochondriac.<br />The preface and appendix discuss recent research regarding Darwin's being an invalid during parts of his life.  Some research deals with a disease that he may have picked up in South America while on the voyage of the HMS Beagle; some research says that Darwin was merely obsessed with being sick and therefore created a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br />This brings us to the text.  Although Darwin's life is shown to us, as well as some additional information on family and colleagues, the life is covered in regards to his worst periods of sickness.  By plotting this out for us, Bowlby shows us that many of these periods are preceded by deaths of family members close to Darwin and by fierce scrutiny of his discoveries and writings.<br />Another idea is the family's way of dealing with intense emotion.  Rather than express this emotion by crying or mourning, it was internalized.  This internalization led to depression, which led to sickness.<br />This biography is written less as a narrative of Darwin's life, but more as a proof for the author's thoughts on Darwin's sickness.  As a result, there are many points where the author becomes more noticeable.<br />This is still an intriguing book, and I would recommend reading it.	2003-01-23

Terms such as simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex are mentioned in the introduction, but the author creates new terms to help writers think of sentences in a new way.  For example, the author explains \\"recast\\" and \\"conditioned\\" sentences as variations that can be used to spice things up.  The lack of the standard terms does not make this book more difficult.<br />I would recommend this book to students and writers.  The author explains each structure and gives examples.

What I mean is, not only do we read about things like \\"Life of Brian\\" and \\"The Meaning of Life,\\" but we also hear about \\"Silverado\\" and \\"Splitting Heirs.\\"<br />The book provides a chronology starting with John Cleese's birthday in 1939 to 1997.  There is also a list of videos and books as well as addresses for the British and American fan clubs.<br />The focus for the entries is on the Monty Python cast.  For instance, not a lot of information is given on the movie \\"Silverado,\\" but there is quite a bit of information about John Cleese's role in the movie.<br />Unfortunately, there are not a lot of pictures in the book.  Personally, I think that would be a grand addition to this work.<br />I would recommend this for diehard fans of Monty Python.	2003-01-23

Although this book can be read from start to finish, its merit lies in being a great addition to any writer's reference library.<br />The text does not rely on having a command of grammar or writing terminology.  Instead, the reader is given plenty of examples showing different ways paragraphs can be structured for effectiveness.<br />For each example, the author explains the example, then provides more examples for reference.  Also, the topic sentence for each paragraph is highlight to help ease understanding.<br />I would highly recommend this book for all students taking a writing course and for all writers who wish to improve their writing.	2003-01-23

By viewing this snapshot, we appreciate the time that we do have in life.<br />The narrative of the book takes place in the span of a day.  There is no consistent narrator here.  Instead, Woolf has us go from character to character to see the world from the mind and eyes of each.  This can be a little disorienting, but the reader senses the cohesion of all people and their effects on one another.<br />Most of the time, we are seeing things from the perspective of Clarissa Dalloway on the day of a party she is giving.  The other characters we see are in some way connected to her.  Some are related, some are friends, some are associates, and some are just people she sees in the park.  Seeing this connection should get us to pause and notice what goes on around us.<br />I would recommend reading this book.  I would especially recommend it if you are reading the Michael Cunningham book, \\"The Hours.\\"	2003-01-09

From the obscure to the mainstream, the author shows the depth of his research.  He refers to such work as \\"horrid\\" literature.  After reading, I don't think he intends to disregard the tradition, but I think he is trying to maintain distance.<br />The text follows a linear train of thought as it goes from the Graveyard Poets to more modern movies.  As it progresses, the author continues to link how a particular book or film borrowed an element or two from a previous work.  From this, all horror sounds formulaic and was stolen from some place else.  This is misleading.  Most works borrow from others.  The thrill comes in mastering the elements or giving them a twist.  I was disappointed that more was not said of H.P. Lovecraft, but that's just my wish.<br />After reading this book, I feel that the same came be done for most genres.  Every genre has particular conventions and cliches that are used to get a specific response from the reader.  Crypts create a sense of terror.  A quest means growth or coming of age.  A sandy beach at sunset means romance is brewing.  This is what makes a genre a genre.<br />One of the benefits of the book is the bibliography.  Any fan of horror, gothic or slasher, will learn of more books to read.<br />I would not recommend the book for casual reading.  I would recommend it if you are a horror enthusiast looking for new authors.	2003-01-09

Rather than be lulled to sleep with rules, this book wittily explains some of the finer points of writing.<br />Tips abound in this volume of insight into the world of grammar.  A fair part of this book is focused on commonly confused words.  Knowing the difference in the words will help any writer overcome the false confidence that spell-check and grammar-check give.  This book is not just about grammar.  The authors included a section on improving spelling and a section on improving writing in general.  Each is explained well and has examples.<br />Another feature of this book worth mentioning is the quizzes given.  The answers are in the back, which allows the readers to test their knowledge.  <br />Although the wording is easy to follow, beginners may not get the most out of this book unless they are already familiar with the parts of speech.  As a reference for those wanting to upgrade their writing, this fits the bill.  I would recommend it.	2003-01-09

Norman Schwartzkopf	Books	4	17	19	N	N	A very readable military autobiography	The book begins with a young Norman Schwarzkopf.  As with many autobiographies, there is not a vast amount of childhood memories, but here, enough memories are included to show the influence on a soldier.<br />From his childhood, Schwarzkopf lived a military life.  With all the skills and languages he learned, as well as the cultures he experienced, the reader sees how all these were put to good use in the many duties and functions he has carried out for the United States.<br />His tale not only covers the events of his life, but the reader also sees how the Army has changed since Vietnam.  His perspective provides us with a bit of insight that all non-soldiers should see.  Although he uses some military terminology, this book is very easy to understand.<br />What really struck me was that he left out the names of many people he really disagreed with to prevent attacking them personally.  He does mention names when he is giving praise.  This, I feel, added a lot of class to my image of the general.<br />As expected, quite a bit of this book covers the Desert Shield and Desert Storm operations.  Also, the book ends rather abruptly after the operations were over.  <br />I would recommend reading this book, and I thank him for sharing this.	2003-01-09

Here, lycanthropes, vampires, and cartographers explore places like Bosoxia or party in the Schloss.  Provided the vocabulary used for the examples does not discourage you from reading, this book is an entertaining way to explore the many commonly confused words of the English language.<br />As with other books by Gordon, this is a handy reference to have, but it is not a quick reference.  Then entries are alphabetically listed, but you would have to search to find what you need.  Unlike other of her books, this one does not have the detailed illustrations.  This is a little disappointing, but it is still a helpful book.<br />The \\"Deluxe Transitive Vampire\\" and the \\"New Well-Tempered Sentence\\" are mentioned in the text in a few places.  Having all three on your desk would make writing a more productive and witty endeavor.  Referring to this book will help improve your writing.  I would recommend it if the examples don't scare you off.	2003-01-05

A familiar cast of characters featuring baby vampires and chimera abound throughout the pages to demonstrate the parts of speech and sentence structure.<br />Although this book will work as a review or a teaching tool, the vocabulary may dissuade the beginner from reading it.  For instance, what exactly is a chimera or a samovar?  If you don't know, you can still learn from the book, but you will not get the humor.  I would read a sample before purchasing.<br />One of the nice touches this book has is the inclusion of margins.  The author invites you to make notes and comments to help enhance the experience.  This is very helpful.<br />I would recommend this book more as a review than as a beginner's book.  The format is not conducive to quick reference.  It is a fun and educational read.	2003-01-05

Rather than a primer with dull examples, Gordon has fun and demonstrates the different punctuation, with their rules, with humor.  Samovars and vampires abound.<br />Although the sections are arranged by the punctuation mark, this is not a quick reference; there are no tabs.  The book is short, so thumbing through the pages shouldn't take too long.  The illustrations make this more enjoyable.<br />This book seems prepared for voracious readers rather than beginners.  The vocabulary of the examples will discourage someone unfamiliar with the names and ideas.  I would recommend reading a sample before purchasing.  If you understand the rule and laugh, then you need to purchase the book.<br />I would recommend this book for lovers of literature looking to review their punctuation skills.	2003-01-05

Given the size and length of this book, I felt that this would work best.  After reading this book, I believe this is the best choice for learning about Virginia Woolf.<br />The author knew Mrs. Woolf personally.  He met her through his mother, who was one of Mrs. Woolf's lovers.  He was a child at the time, so some of his observations do not go into depth but are merely an observation (such as an observation about a party held by the Bloomsbury group).  Nicholson has done quite a bit of research and read through many of her letters (including those to and from his mother), so there is some intriguing information.<br />This does not read like a narrative.  Although the material is arranged chronologically, at times the book talks about the controversy around Mrs. Woolf rather than about Mrs. Woolf.  For instance, rather than discussion the relations of the family, he discusses the controversy that Mrs. Woolf may have been raped by her half brother.  The author discusses the different theories and supports his through the wording of letters.  Although interesting, I would rather focus on Virginia.<br />Putting aside the author's editorializing, I would recommend this book only as a start for studying Virginia Woolf.	2003-01-05

Life is a beautiful thing and should be cherished.<br />His story is well written and is framed within Virginia Woolf's book \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\"  Within this book, three women's lives are being discussed in parallel.  The writing is engaging, so the book can be understood on its own.  However, character names and events parallel the life of Virginia Woolf and the heroine of her book.  By reading this first, like a companion text, characters, situations, and ideas become more apparent and lasting.<br />Even if the story was not interesting, watching the way Cunningham weaves his book with Woolf's is worth the reading.  I would recommend reading this book.	2003-01-05

This is a collection of essays explaining different philosophers by using the well-known TV show Seinfeld.  The result, for me, was a much better understanding of different philosophical topics.<br />The different essays cover the different philosophers like Socrates, Nietzsche, Sartre, and Wittgenstein.  Using the famous characters from the TV show, the authors illustrate the different philosophers.  If school was a little fuzzy on the explanation, this is a good supplement.<br />Because it is a collection, most of the authors used the same episode to refer to.  I do wish they used more episodes, but \\"The Opposite\\" is a well-known episode.  Also, a couple of the essays give different impressions of Kramer.  Although this feels contradictory, the book is not meant to read as one work.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who does not feel assured of his or her understanding of philosophy.	2002-12-27

Books	4	5	6	N	N	The perspective is intriguing	The premise of this book is that the America as we know it is slowly ceasing to be; America is slowly transforming into a socialist state.<br />From most writers, I would immediately stop taking the book seriously.  Instead, I found myself becoming more interested in the story because of the author's background.  He grew up in Eastern Europe before the Soviet Empire began to change his country.  This is the experience from which he draws his information.<br />Many movements that he sees acting in America today are doing the same things that the communists did to his country years ago.  History was rewritten to take away any prestige his country had or pride he had in is country.  He sees this today in the rewriting of many of our textbooks.<br />Although I wish he had given more specific examples for some of his claims, I do respect his perspective and find myself reading the news more closely.  This is an interesting book, and I would recommend reading it.	2002-12-01

This is similar to a professor in college showing you the problems on the board, but these don't get erased and are much more legible.<br />In addition to the solved problems, there are supplementary problems to test your understanding of the material.  At the end of each chapter, the answers are printed for you to check your work.<br />The discussions of set theory include definitions to ensure that you are familiar with the lingo.  There are also plenty of examples to illustrate the author's meaning.  With all the information on set theory, there are also chapters on quantifiers, boolean algebra, logical reasoning, and the algebra of propositions.<br />This book provides some good assistance in learning set theory.	2002-10-30

Although this is very helpful, I like to be able to test my knowledge.  I say this is good for review because you will remember as you read this.  You will also have a good idea of whether you are doing the supplementary problems correct or not.  Here, most the supplementary problems do not have answers.  Those that do, just have the final answer rather than an illustration of how the writers got the answer.  This is difficult if you are learning about real variables for the first time.<br />As well as giving you the basic concepts, this book also goes into Lebesgue integrals, Riemann integrals, and Fourier series.  The explanations are fairly well written, and the examples are easy to follow.	2002-10-30

First, the supplementary questions have the answers so that you can check your understanding.  Also, the book includes unit exams and a final exam, all of which have an answer key.  This helps me build my confidence in working through the material of discrete structures.<br />This is a very helpful book.	2002-10-30

This book, from the Schaum's Outline series, provides you with additional examples to supplement your classroom time.  Each problem is worked out for you, so you can see exactly how the answer is reached.<br />The outline series also explains some of the concepts, like partial derivatives and Fourier series.  At the end of each chapter are some supplementary problems to test your knowledge.  Unfortunately, not all of them have the answer printed.  It is still a helpful reference to help you master the concepts of calculus.	2002-10-30

Also, it has plenty of programming examples and problems, which are broken down step by step.  This is very helpful in working through this computer language.<br />Unlike other books in the same series, this book does not come with exams with answers.  Instead, this has sections throughout the book called Rapid Review, which is just as helpful.  As you read, you will come across the section with a few questions to test your knowledge on a particular area.  If you missed a question in the review, then you know exactly what you have to go over again.  This is helpful in solidly learning the material before moving one.<br />This really helps in reinforcing what you are learning in class (although not that many people take classes in C anymore).	2002-10-30

Why?  The field of computer science is changing everyday, and that makes it difficult to keep this book up to date.<br />Some of the basics will not change.  For instance, this book discusses boolean algebra, arrays, sorting, and subprogram, which should not change too much.  The section on programming languages and computer design will probably see quite a bit of variation.  If you buy this book used, you will want to verify what year the book was copyrighted.<br />Like the other outline books, there are some supplementary questions to test your understanding and grasp of the information.  In the back of the book, there are answers to most of the questions.  There is also a bibliography, which is good, but could also go out of date quickly.<br />The writing of the book is fairly straightforward and easy to understand.  I would recommend this book as a supplement to all computer science students.	2002-10-30

For instance, here vectors, matrices, and probability (among other things) are covered here and in their own book.  How do you choose?  You have to ask yourself how much information you need.  This book is not as detailed as others are.<br />There are lots of solved problems here to help you learn to work the various problems.  The explanations are fairly easy to follow.  There are also supplementary questions for you to check you knowledge, and the answers are printed at the end of the chapter.  You can either work from the answer to the question or work towards the answer from the question, whichever helps you.<br />A very helpful book, but if you have other books from the series, you may be duplicating topics.	2002-10-30

This finds the remnant of the Jews staying in Petra and the GC unable to harm them.  Meanwhile, the Co-op is trying to continue its work for believers without being caught.<br />As an individual book, this would be a very difficult read.  As the series progresses, new characters are introduced, which makes it a little difficult to follow everyone's movements.  The cast of characters in the beginning helps, but it still takes some concentration.<br />In this book, the authors mention the followers of Islam.  The depiction here doesn't follow what LaHaye has written in other books outside of this series, but it makes since that the followers are mentioned in this series.<br />I would recommend reading this series.	2002-10-29

All this will help you to refine your skills with confidence.<br />Unfortunately, all this is not here.  This workbook is designed as a textbook, so the answers are not sold with the books.  If you are with an educational institution, then you may be able to get the answer key (which is not always correct).  This makes it hard to verify your understanding.<br />This workbook does have some things going for it.  Before each new set of practice exercises, there are explanations of the area in question.  This is usually enough to explain the material so purchasing \\"The Little, Brown Handbook\\" is not absolutely necessary.  However, there is some material, like relative clauses, which are not explained too well for understanding with confidence.<br />I would use this for a class if I had the accompanying textbook.  I would also take note that the instructions for the exercises usually have more than one thing you need to do.  But as a refresher, I would not take this without a class.	2002-10-25

For too long, believers have kept their beliefs in the church rather than out in the world.  The book calls for us to adopt a Christian worldview as well as become involved in our communities.  <br />The book is generally divided into three parts.  The first part is a hypothetical case showing us where America is heading.  The father in this case is talking with his son about school.  Although the case seems far-fetched, many of the things mentioned have already happened, or are just a few steps away from happening.<br />The next part is about how America is getting to the point illustrated in the case.  Primarily, it is through the inactivity of Christians politically to confront secular humanism that we have let these things happen, which leads to the third part, the authors' call to action.<br />Although I found a few logical fallacies in the argument, the overall argument is true.  If you are worried about where America is going morally, then I recommend you read this book.  There is also a bibliography of suggested readings.	2002-10-21

Even though he respected and praised John Adams, he was also sure to point out the comments that other politicians of the time said about Adams.  Granted, the comments were mostly explained away as being political in nature.<br />The annals of American history have largely passed Adams by, but after reading this book, perhaps historians may want to revisit this patriot.  As mentioned in the book, it is easy to remember Thomas Jefferson since he was the better writer.  Adams' forte was in oratory, and there are no recordings to show us how good he was.  We only have mentions of it in others' letters and journals.<br />All the stages of his life receive equal mention, but his time in Europe stands out to me more.  His work behind the scenes there helped the nation become recognized.<br />I not only learned about Adams, but I learned a bit about Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.  It is hard to imagine our forefathers participating in political scandal and savagery.  Perhaps we have not changed much from those times.<br />I would highly recommend reading this book.	2002-10-21

Lem wrote this in 1961, which predates Arthur C. Clarke's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" (written in 1968).  There are some similar themes.  I don't know if Clarke was familiar with this book, or if reading this after reading the book or Kubrick's film has caused this sense of deja vu.<br />The story concerns a space station where the scientists are studying, and attempting to make contact with, the planet Solaris.  Each character has to deal with his or her own internal doubts, but also has to interact with the other members of the crew.  These doubts are more important than you may think on a first read.<br />In the story, there are long sections where Kris Kelvin is going through the library reading up on the research of Solaris and neutrinos.  In the initial read, I thought that a lot of this could have been cut to keep the novel more concise.  Since there is so much of it, I wondered if Lem intended for us to focus on this.  I believe he did.<br />The research and the history of research give us a mirror of our own scientific community.  It also questions the SETI project and our attempts to make contact.  His statement about this seems to be that our endeavor to contact something non-human is flawed because we are approaching it from a human frame of mind.<br />This is a very good book, and I would highly recommend reading it.	2002-09-24

Take a story with hackers pushing the world to chaos in an attempt to keep machines from running everything, but then, take the same story and go back into the 1800s before computers.<br />To fully understand what these two have done, you need to be fairly knowledgeable of the luminaries of that era; some of these luminaries include Byron, Sam Houston, Edward Mallory, Laurence Oliphant, John Keats, and Charles Babbage (to name a few).  Rather than just throw a poet into the role of Prime Minister, they chose a poet who actually was in Parliament.  All their choices are very well thought out; they did their research.  It reminds me of Orson Scott Cards tweaking of American history and legend in the Alvin Maker series.<br />The computers have been replaced by punch cards.  The elements are the same though, such as the authorities have a punch card of everyone with all of his or her information, and meeting the right people can erase your identity.<br />I would recommend reading this book if you are familiar with the Romantic and Victorian eras.	2002-09-23

Much of it was taken almost word for word from the book.  The book's focus is not only about the characters' love, but about a meditation on the existence of God.  All else in this World War II drama is working to support that thesis.<br />In the book, the supposed lover in the story (the fourth wheel?) has a larger part in this story as a philosophical dissenter who argues against the existence of God.  He is the one with the skin affliction and is involved in the miraculous event.  By the end of the novel, Bendrix and he are confronted with proof that they cannot refute.  Thus, the novel ends with an acknowledgement that God exists.<br />If this sounds like an overtly religious novel, I would say it isn't.  All though the presence of God is a large part of it, this is still a good story and I would recommend reading it.	2002-09-13

Instead, the book continues to pace itself between all the characters giving the reader a feeling of jumping from movie serial to movie serial.<br />Given that the book is the last book of the trilogy, the ending should wrap up all the loose ends.  Although the characters come together and some get their comeuppance, there are just as many questions raised as answered.  What will the Rovers do now?  What will the Ilse Witch do now?  What will the elves do?<br />This is not an altogether bad thing.  For those of us who find ourselves always waiting for the next Terry Brooks book, we have solace in knowing that there must be new Shannara books on the horizon to answer these questions.	2002-09-13

For the Simpsons viewer or trivia buff, the stance of the Simpsons is secondary to philosophy in this book.  If you want to try to understand some philosophical ideas with examples from the Simpsons, then this book is for you.<br />By and large, the writers of this book are fans of the show.  Although they quote a bit, their quotes are not always correct, and this may detract from enjoyment.  For instance, the argument that Marge is an example of the virtuous person was made.  It mentions several instances to support this, but the writer of that essay does not address the episodes that show her gambling addiction.  Without knowing if the episode came out before or after the essay, I don't know if this is a simple error or not.<br />Some of the material is quite dense, and the relation to the Simpsons is not direct.  The last essay explaining Heidegger and postulating that Bart may be considered a \\"Heideggerian\\" has some very complex ideas. <br />This is not always bad.  The essay talking of signifiers and the signified (Roland Barthes) actually made the ideas a little easier to understand.  I remember going the S/Z many years ago.  Giving me an example from a Simpsons episode was very helpful.<br />From the subtitle, I thought there would be more Eastern philosophy, but alas, there was not a whole lot of mention.  The philosophers covered are primarily Western.<br />I don't think that I would recommend this to Simpsons fans because they already know that the show is funny and needs to be seen repeatedly to get all the gags.  I would recommend this to beginning philosophy students.  Have fun!	2002-09-13

That is not to say that the equations are not there.  They are, but there are less than other books in the series.<br />This is also not the typical book in the series because there are no problems for you to check your understanding of the equations.  This seems to be intended more for a reference.  What is helpful, however, is the list of references at the end of each chapter.  <br />The main topics covered here are fluid mechanics, elasticity, electromagnetic theory, and dynamics.  Since this is more of a reference, I would not recommend this if you are learning the information for the first time.	2002-08-29

Each section is well explained and the sample problems take you through the process step-by-step.<br />The only problem I have with the book is that not all the supplementary exercises (to test your understanding) have the answers.

This book assumes that you understand integrals and other mathematical theories.  I would not use this to teach myself about Laplace transforms.<br />As a supplement, this is a fairly good book.  As with most books in the series, there are various step-by-step instructions to show you how these work and to explain the various functions and theories.

If you do, this book is very helpful in that it gives a step-by-step approach to solving matrix operations problems.  Although I wouldn't use this book by itself, I would recommend getting this to supplement the class.  If you have already taken the class, then this is a good refresher or reference for you.<br />The topics covered are inversions, determinants, vectors, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, functions, square matrices, hermitian and positive definite matrices, canonical bases, unitary transformations, and nonnegative and patterned matrices, among other topics.  As with other books in the Schaum's series, there are supplementary questions to test your knowledge and understanding.  Most of the answers are in the back.	2002-08-27

The supplementary problems, to help you test your knowledge, have the answers there.  This used to bother me because I wanted to see if I could get the answer.  Here, the author is just trying to help you master the process.

A lot of the topics covered in the Matrix Operations book is covered in here.  Personally, I would look here first.  The chapters are broken down a bit more, so you can focus on what you want to work on.<br />The answers aren't printed in this one like other books.  In the supplementary problems, some have answers and some have hints.  This is a little bothersome because I can't check my work as I would like.

With each chapter, there are plenty of explanations and examples.  The book also has problems you can try to test your knowledge of the chapter.<br />The problem I have with it is that not all the problems have answers to them.  The explanations are great, but I want to make sure I understand it.  There doesn't seem to be a pattern regarding which ones have answers in the back.  You just have to try the problem, then look in the back to see if that one was answered.<br />I would still recommend this to help reinforce what you learn in class or just to refresh your memory.	2002-08-26

Rather than a large chapter of dry reading, this book keeps everything simple, and to the point.  Rather than a large discussion of Newton's Laws, they are simply listed for your reference.<br />The topics covered in the book are much too numerous to list out.  I compared this with my physics textbook for science and engineering students.  If you are having trouble understanding your textbook, use this text as a supplement.  It does walk through problems and has problems you can try.  <br />Regarding the practice problems, the answers are there, but they are right there.

He walks you through several problems, and then you can test yourself with some supplementary problems.  Although the answers to the particular problems are not there, you can many times compare it with a problem discussed previously in the chapter.  It is still difficult to know if you got it right, but you will have a good idea.<br />I would recommend this.	2002-08-26

There are plenty of definitions, explanations, charts, and tables to help you remember and understand all the appropriate information.  This is a very handy reference.<br />As with other books in the series, this book walks you through a few problems and then gives you some to solve.

At the beginning is also a review of the basic terms and rules.<br />This is a good book to review to refresh your memory of what you studied in school.  If you are in school now, this will be a good supplement.

He is chosen to be an apprentice by none other than Death.  This is amusing considering that a translation of \\"morte\\" is death.  This is a fairly typical coming-of-age fantasy with quite a bit of humor.<br />Terry Pratchett sets the bulk of the novel in his Discworld, which is held on the back of a giant turtle.  If you have never read any of the Discworld books, don't worry, you will not be lost here.  If you are not a fan of Monty Python/British humor, then you might not get all the jokes and puns.  Also, you might not understand why so much is spent on cabbage.<br />The story is solid.  Although the journey of Mort towards manhood is not linear, there are no gaps in the narrative.  The flow keeps you involved in the story from beginning to end.  I would recommend reading this for a laugh.	2002-08-19

A boy shows a knack for magic, so he begins a long journey towards mastering the power.  Along the way, he will meet a girl with similar abilities and will engage in the fight of his life.  These are true, but the framework makes this an interesting read.<br />Judith Tarr did her research into the ancient days of the Catholic church and the Holy Roman Empire.  The characters she chooses are Pope Sylvester and Emperor Otto.  Each of these had rumors about them insinuating that they were practitioners of magic.  Tarr takes this and posits \\"What if this were true?\\"  Having an actual historical figure to borrow from adds a tinge of authenticity to the book.<br />At times, I feel that the narrative jumps a little bit.  I don't know if Tarr was keeping to the history (for instance, perhaps no record exists of Sylvester at a certain age), or if she was try to keep the book flowing.  I would have liked to know a little more about the school of magic he tried to found.<br />Nonetheless, this is a fairly good read.  It is a quick book, so I would recommend reading this.	2002-08-19

This book is that fictional diary.  It leads up to his death and ends with a letter from his bride to be included in his tomb.<br />If your child is interested in Egypt, this is a good book.  There are Egyptian words, with English spelling, throughout and these are supported by a glossary in the back.  Also, there are illustrations of some of the different items the young boy talks about. <br />Some of the words and names may slow your child down, but in all, the reading level is fairly easy.

After reading this book, I realized that if anything, this show discusses religion much more often than other shows.  Beneath the humor, there are some serious issues being discussed.<br />First, Pinsky points out that this family gives us a good view of ourselves.  Many of the religious attitudes we see are found everyday in society.  Rather than making fun of the religion, the writers are pointing our some of our own inconsistencies in religious thought.  For instance, how do we, like Homer or Bart, suddenly turn to prayer and promise many things when we have gotten ourselves into trouble?<br />The author also talks of the different religions, like Hinduism, Catholicism, and Judaism, which are covered in the show.  He also discusses some of the different \\"battles\\" they have had with different religious groups.<br />If you are a Simpsons' fan, then I would recommend this book.  Also, if you have refused to see the show because of its irreverence, I would recommend reading this book, and then giving the show a chance.	2002-08-08

The Freemasons organization has been accused of many things throughout the world, such as assassinations and revolutions, but Ridley scrutinizes these accusations and explains that most of this is coincidental or that the myth-writer has a different agenda.<br />The history of the Freemasons covers the beginnings in the British Isles and the creation of lodges in Europe, Asia, and South and North America.  He explains how the membership of the lodges has changed through time as well as how the lodge has changed its organization.  He does not seek to expose any secrets, but points out that the organization is similar to many others, but prefers to keep it rituals and initiations to itself.<br />This secrecy, according to Ridley, is the main reason why there are so many conspiracy theories concerning the Freemasons.  An example of the theories is that Jack the Ripper was a Freemason, and another is that the Freemasons started the American Revolution. He points out that although some of the American founding fathers were Freemasons, many of them were not.  He also points out that less democratic governments tend to fear the lodge and will present any manner of propaganda to suppress it.<br />This is a good book to read to learn a bit more about the organization.  Also, if you are a conspiracy theorist, I would recommend reading this for balance.	2002-08-08

This is not an autobiography subtly asking you to worship the writer.  This is an average guy who is walking you through his career in movies and TV.  If anything, this will be more inspiring for aspiring actors because you will feel that it is possible.<br />If you are a fan, then you will be able to fill in his voice as he tells you the story.  There are points in the book where I laughed out loud.  Also, being a fan of the Evil Dead series, this provided some background information that I found very interesting.  It is amazing that he stayed in movies after all the things that happened there in Tennessee.<br />Throughout the book are samples of e-mail messages that he has received from fans and non-fans.  These keep things in perspective for the reader as well as for Campbell.  I wished he had mentioned the web-site address in the book.<br />I would recommend this for aspiring actors and for fans.	2002-08-08

The workbook combines exercises and explanations together.<br />The best advantage to this is the sections which allow the student to check his or her understanding.  At the beginning of each section, about ten questions have the answers at the bottom of the page.  Also, the unit review has answers printed for the student's reference.<br />One of the disadvantages is the organization.  For instance, section 8 lists avoiding and correcting for double negatives as an objective.  Unfortunately, double negatives are not covered there.  In checking the index, double negatives are mentioned on page 128 in section 13.  There, the reference is only a hotline query that states what a double negative is.<br />Another disadvantage is there are less exercises than in previous editions.  The previous editions had &quot;Proofreading Alerts,&quot; which I thought were very helpful in providing a more practical way to test comprehension.<br />This is a usable workbook, but it would not be my first choice.	2002-08-01

According to Jacobs, the aliens are planning to inhabit our world and control us.<br />There are a few things I have difficulty with in reading his research.  First, his evidence is mostly from hypnosis sessions.  Jacobs' credentials as a historian is not in doubt, but he never discusses where he learned to hypnotize people.  <br />He discusses how other hypnotists are making errors by asking leading questions, but assures us that he is not.  As an example, he mentions an abductee telling him that the aliens were playing a game of Monopoly.  Not wanting to lead the abductee, he asks what the aliens are looking at.  This way, he does lead the person to believe Monopoly is really being played.  Kudos for that, but Jacobs, it appears, has lead the witness to believe in the alien abduction.  <br />He does mention a poll, the Roper Poll, in Omni magazine which reputedly says that statistically abductions happen.  From the same poll, however, there should also be ghosts, which he does not go into any detail on.<br />By his work, he feels that there is a breeding program (the alien abductees and the aliens) which will lead to the aliens taking control of our planet.  Basically, we will not be able to distinguish the hybrids (as he calls them) and us.  This is a bit apocalyptic.<br />Jacobs does call for stricter guidelines in hynopsis, which everyone feels would be helpful.  I just wish he had thought of this before predicting the end of the world as we know it.	2002-07-29

Instead, he is a skeptic who is trying to point out some of the irrationalities in the beliefs in UFOs and other related phenomenon.<br />Using different scientific laws and principles, like Occam's Razor, Schaeffer debunks the \\"proof\\" of UFOs in our world today.  In each chapter, he walks through many of the classic UFO sightings and shows you how all the \\"facts\\" don't fit together or are changing as the story gets older.<br />At first, I read this as a believer who was calling for more rigid investigation so that we can focus our attention on what we believe to be actual unidentified flying objects.  As you read, you will see that he feels that the believers, of whom he is not one, should adopt a more rigid standard in their investigations just as science does.  In science, open forum is welcomed to search for truth whereas many UFO studies refuse to scrutinized and result to ad hominem attacks to protect their copyrighted property.<br />Scheaffer does bring in a strong argument.  He does have a chapter on witchcraft in the Middle Ages to help support his argument.  After reflection, it does help, but it is not immediately apparent in the writing.<br />If you are a believer or UFOlogist, you will not want to read this book.  If you want to take a more balanced view of UFO phenomenon, this should be among the books you read.	2002-07-25

The only recent events talked about are the movie Independence Day and the joint promotion they did with Nevada.<br />Susan Wright has merely collected many well-known people, investigations, theories, and events from the past and mentioned them all here.  There are many other books that give this to you, so this one does not help.  Also, the narrative seems to skip from point to point without a logical order.<br />If you know absolutely nothing about UFOs, their investigations, and conspiracy theories to cover them up, then you might read this to become familiar with the people and places.

This book has shown me that the programs and successes from Kennedy's presidency were not as easy as I thought.<br />First, I was not aware at how sick JFK actually was.  I knew about his fight with Addison's disease, but I didn't know about his back pain.  This book talks briefly about how his living off treatments to fight his pain affected his everyday work in the White House. <br />Second, JFK and his administration were keenly aware of what was politic and what was not.  Their focus on the Soviet Union, Berlin, Vietnam, and Cuba took most of their time and kept them from taking a more active role in the civil rights movement here in the United States.  The idea of reelection never seemed to be far from their thoughts.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone wanting a view of the goings-on during the Kennedy presidency.	2002-07-11

This will give you very valuable insight in a very readable narrative.<br />The most important thing to note is that this is about his life and not about his presidency.  His one term as president is covered in only one chapter towards the end of the book.  More time is spent on his early development and yearning for a literary career, as well as some emphasis on his time after the presidency when he served in the House of Representatives.<br />Nagel does a good job in providing names and dates, which allow you to put JQA's life into perspective; furthermore, the writing does not get bogged down in the minutiae.  The emphasis is on a highly intelligent man who buries himself in work and in his country, but who feels he did not do enough.<br />I would recommend reading this book, especially after the success of the biography of his father, John Adams.	2002-07-11

Using surveys, interviews, and tax information, this book draws a picture of the millionaire.  The picture will likely not match your idea.<br />Does having the statistical picture of a millionaire help?  After reading this book, I am inclined to say \\"yes.\\"  Seeing fancy clothes, expansive homes, and expensive cars reminded me of wealth.  As pointed out, the average millionaire is not concerned with the appearance of wealth.  For some reason, knowing that I don't have to look wealthy calms me and encourages me.<br />One concept that will stay with me is the necessity of offense and defense to attain wealth.  The authors point out that merely earning lots of money (offense) will not always help.  Just as in sports, you need to play good defense to win.  Here, the author's point out that you need to control your spending and debt if you want to reach wealth.<br />This book was recommended in \\"The Cashflow Quadrant\\" book (of the Rich Dad, Poor Dad series).

We cheered as he became the president, for we knew this was a step towards racial equality in South Africa.  But, most of us do not know why he was imprisoned, how he became a leader, and what the conditions were like in his country before he was elected.  This book goes through all this.<br />Mandela grew up in the village of Qunu in the Transkei region of South Africa where he enjoyed a rural life without many of the amenities we take for granted today.  We follow Mandela has he attends school and college while he begins to understand more about the world around him and the plight of Africans in South Africa.  This provides a contrast to his living in presidential quarters which helps illustrate how long the proverbial walk was.<br />The bulk of the book deals with his time in the ANC and in prison (where he was a political prisoner being punished for his beliefs in freedom).  Mandela seems to downplay his individual role in all of this, but illustrates that he was one part of something much larger.  He mentions names of many colleagues and organizations which had a part in fighting apartheid.<br />At times, I struggled with the names because I am not familiar with the pronunciation.  With time, these will not slow you down, and you will appreciate how great this struggle for freedom was.  I recommend reading this book.	2002-06-13

As an instructor, I found this very easy for my students to understand and relate to.<br />One of the strongest points of this text is the interviews with different contemporary people to explain religious belief.  An example of this would be an interview with Ann-Ping Chin on Confucianism in today's society.  This is much easier for students to relate to than using discussions of ancient religious leaders only.<br />Each chapter has a list of suggested readings, which I found very useful in preparing discussions.  The publisher also has a web-site with exercises and links for each chapter to assist students in studying the different religions.<br />I would recommend this book.	2002-06-13

Since students are only in my class for a few hours a week, they need a book that explains ideas in detail.  This book allows me to spend time on other things in class.<br />Covered in this book are the entire writing process, from idea generation to revision; various kinds of essays; and research.  This also has a section on decisions for collaborative writing, which I find very useful.<br />Some of the best examples in the book show how to make sentences more concise.  Avoiding \\"there\\" and \\"it\\" sentence openers, weak verbs, excessive prepositions, and nominalizations are some of them.  For each one, the author shows you examples of what is wordy and what is concise.  Students find this very helpful.<br />I would recommend using this book for an English class or if you just need something to improve your writing skills.	2002-06-13

Gross discusses the reasons for continuing our learning as well as the ways we can maximize our learning potential.<br />Gross begins be talking about the necessity and science of learning.  At first, I thought this was not essential to book, but it does provide a rationale for learning as well as help the reader build confidence in his or her ability to learn as an adult.  This had a positive effect on students in my class.<br />Throughout the book are many exercises readers can use to discover what kind of learners they are, such as top-down or bottom-up.  This allows them to structure their study more effectively and to recognize the different pitfalls that could discourage them.  Knowing that other people have the same fears and abilities can be emboldening.<br />I would highly recommend this to all adults.  To keep up in this economy and workplace, you need to continue learning.  This book can help you do this effectively.	2002-06-13

This covers very basic commands like PRINT, LPRINT, and LLIST; loops; subroutines; nested loops; two- and three-dimensional arrays; strings; files; and medium and high-resolution graphics.<br />Since this was written as a textbook, there are ways to check your understanding.  Each chapter has a review, list of key terms, quiz with answers directly after, and exercises (with answers to some of these in the back.

The book was published back in 1986, so the average user today will not use BASIC.  If you have an old computer and wish to learn this language, this will help.<br />The good thing about this book is that it has questions and quizzes to test your knowledge.  At the end of each chapter are a summary, a glossary, questions to aid understanding (with some of the answers in the back of the book), and a quick quiz.  The quick quiz answers are at the end of each chapter also.  Of these, some simply give the correct answer, whereas others explain why a particular answer is correct.<br />Since this is a programming language not taught much anymore, the average users would not always understand this text.  If you are an enthusiast and still use your Apple IIe or Radio Shack TRS-80, then this book will be usable.	2002-06-10

This is more a book for enthusiasts than for basic users.<br />The book is divided into three parts.  The first part introduces the basics of using and caring for your PC.  It discusses the use of disks and files as well as batch files.  The second part is a guide to different resources for hardware, software, services, accessories, and supplies.  Since this was written almost two decades ago, some of the products and companies mentioned no longer exist.  For instance, it refers to the two types of printers: dot-matrix and letter-quality.  The last part is a reference guide for error messages and troubleshooting. <br />Since this book is a little dated, unless you still tinker with your old computers, then this may not be of much use to you.  The information on files may still be helpful.	2002-06-10

Because of this, most computer users will not be able to use this.  However, computer enthusiasts may have some use for this book.<br />The contents include plotting subroutines, complex variables (like spherical coordinate conversion), vector and matrix applications (like determinants and matrix inversion), random number generators (like Fermi distribution and Poisson distribution), and basic series approximations (like Taylor series expansions).  In each chapter, Ruckdeschel describes the mathematics involved, then explains how the subroutine is written.<br />If you need to write these kinds of subroutines for your work, this can provide a starting point for you.  This was written before the World Wide Web became so popular so some of these you may now find on the Net.	2002-06-10

For most computer users today, this is not helpful since many programs do the work for you.  For computer enthusiasts who still tinker with the BASIC programming language, this could be helpful.<br />This book not only explains the basic routines needed to create the graphics, but it explains the mathematics involved and shows diagrams to help you visualize what you will be creating.  Some of the ideas covered in this book are animation, analytic geometry, and three-dimensional graphics.<br />If you have a fairly good grounding in mathematics, this book could be of use to computer enthusiasts.  If you let the software do the work for you, then this book will not help you.	2002-06-10

This is part of series called \\"Numerical Recipes: The Art of Scientific Computing\\" which provide explanation and examples of how you can use the computer to help your work.  This particular book does not go into detail about the math, but it gives you examples of routines used to solve your particular problem.<br />Some of the examples listed cover linear algebraic equations, Fourier methods, and partial differential equations.  As mentioned, these are written in Pascal, so if you are not familiar with that programming language, these routines will not help you understand the math.  If you need to write such routines, and you understand Pascal, this book will help you get ideas for your programming needs.	2002-06-10

This book is more autobiographical.  Each chapter covers a different deal, which were mostly in the 1980s.  To learn from this will require some reading between the lines and some extrapolation.<br />With the exception of the first couple chapters, which talk about his early years, each chapter goes into some detail about a different deal, like the USFL and Trump Plaza.  Trump talks about some negotiations, licensing, and construction.  Reading about the steps behind each deal has some benefit if you are patient and read carefully.<br />Unfortunately, you need to understand the time, New York/New Jersey, and Trump to get this information.  Since the information is from the 80s, it is a bit dated.  Also, if you are not familiar with New York or New Jersey, many of his references (which are oftentimes just the streets involved) will mean nothing to you.  Trump also does a lot of name-dropping.  If you are not from the area, then most of the names will mean nothing (with the exception of some of the USFL players he mentions).<br />I would rate this book higher if it wasn't so dated.  If you are familiar with the area and time covered in the book, then this can be helpful.	2002-06-08

Readers will find themselves agreeing with a lot of things in this book and slapping their heads because they didn't see this earlier.<br />This book is more about assumptions and how these need to change for us to become successful.  People are broken into categories to help understand how successful people think.  The author gives examples, but he is helping us design our own map towards financial freedom.  He does not give specific advice on how to make money.  There is still a lot of work for the reader to do.  Kiyosaki is merely trying to open our eyes.  <br />The author does have a list of recommended readings in the back of the book, plus more advertisements for his other books and products.<br />This is good reading for anyone willing to change the way he or she thinks about money and success so that financial freedom can be achieved.  I find his explanations to be helpful and clear.	2002-05-28

It is designed for students, but it is also designed to illustrate literature's place in our society.<br />The beginning goes into the writing process and writing about literature.  There is an example of writing on poetry, but it is only two paragraph's worth.  Most students would like to see the whole essay.<br />The bulk of the book is arranged in topics, which have subtopics of fiction, poetry, drama, and nonfiction.  The topics, \\"Growing up and Growing Older,\\" \\"Women and Men,\\" \\"Money and Work,\\" \\"Peace and War,\\" and \\"Varieties of Protest,\\" give you a wide variety of selections to illustrate the idea.  Unless you plan on structuring your course this way, this isn't the easiest text to navigate a class through.<br />The end of the book has a section devoted to each of the subtopics: fiction, poetry, drama, and nonfiction.  Here, strategies and elements of each of these subtopics are illustrated here.  The examples used here refer to selections from the text, which allows the student to refer back.

The first part of the book discusses the writing process, documentation styles, and research.  The second part goes into the mechanics of punctuation and grammar.  In this latter part is a section devoted to ESL/multilingual writers, which points out various pitfalls in the English language.<br />As an instructor, my disappointment is that I can not use this book on its own for grammar and punctuation drills.  There are no exercises in this book, although I believe there is an exercise book, which can be purchased separately.<br />From my students, I have found that students with a stronger grasp of grammar were not as fond of this book as those students who were struggling with grammar.<br />Although not my favorite handbook, this one is quite serviceable.	2002-05-25

If you can imagine him saying these, you will cry from laughing so hard.  One of my favorites is &quot;Top Ten Least Exciting Superpowers for Comic Book Superheroes.&quot;<br />To fully understand the humor of this book, you have to be familiar with the references he makes.  This book was written in the early 90s, so you need to be familiar with the first George Bush and Dan Qualye, as well as the headlines from that time.<br />I would still recommend this book.

Even if you are not a fan of David Letterman and cannot imagine his delivery of these lists, you will still get a chuckle.<br />The only thing against the book is that it is a little dated.  The first tipoff should be the picture of Dave on the front cover.  He hasn't had that much hair in a while.  Secondly, these lists were written in the late 80s so the younger generation may not get all the political and cultural references (such as references to Dan Qualye).<br />I would still recommend this book for anyone needing or wanting a laugh.	2002-05-16

Or, they buy a \\"how-to\\" book and follow a formula, and then they wonder why no one wants the book.  The key to success is revision.  The writing must be honed.  This book helps the writer to do that.<br />I thought this would be a typical editing book, but I was wrong.  Including the easy tone and readability, the biggest plus for this book is the examples.  Seidman walks you through editing some fiction passages in this book.  Once you see a solid example of what he means, you will be a more discerning writer.<br />For anyone wanting to write or edit fiction, I would recommend this book.

It is a collection of essays by well known editors discussing their craft and the inner-workings of a publishing house.<br />For writers, this book will clear up some misconceptions on what an editor can, and can not, do for you.  It lets you know what many editors are looking for, and explains the various kinds of editing.  I would recommend Scott Walker's essay on small presses.  After reading this, you should take a long look at which house you wish to publish your manuscript.<br />For potential editors, this book will give you a better view of the different kinds of editing and the way the editing world is changing.

This book walks through different scenarios and cases to show you how to do this.<br />As mentioned before, this is not to be read in one sitting.  Orman begins each chapter with a testimonial from someone who has lost assets due to poor planning or bad circumstance.  These stories will make you angry and sad.  Reading them all at once will wear you out.  Orman uses these scenarios to walk you through estate planning, wills, retirement, and benefits.<br />There is also a section on minimizing your expenses while maximizing your profits.  This section has worksheets to help you visualize where you stand.  Likewise, Orman is very good at giving specific examples to explain an idea to you.

That is not the main idea of this book though.  She does mention that it requires a different kind of thinking, but she did not write the screenplays.  She just mentions that some of her books were made into movies in England, American, France, and Germany.<br />If you are picking up this book to learn how to write suspense fiction, this should not be the book.  There are no things to remember and no rules.  Merely, she is telling you about how she has written books.  If you are very familiar with her works (not just the more famous ones), then you may be able to make this work for you.  Otherwise, the book is more about her.

That is the whole point of this biography.  If you are a KISS fan and are picking this up to learn more, there is little to no new information here.  Like most interviews, the information on KISS has been covered previously in so many different places that you will not be surprised.<br />If you have watched recent interviews with Simmons, you will now that he is quite the salesman.  You many even feel that this is a new phenomenon since the band stopped touring.

As mentioned in the book, this is more along the lines of Will Rogers.  It is not strictly aphorisms on investing.<br />Just seeing Buffett's name sparked my enthusiasm in the book.  Thinking this book would have a lot of investing tips, I was disappointed.  The first part of the book consists of sayings on life in general.  As the book progresses, then some investing thoughts are covered.  When they are covered, they are not easily converted into a personal strategy to make a quick profit.<br />This does not mean that it is without merit.  The key idea I will take from this book is to invest in companies rather than stock.  If your research shows that the company is solid, you should invest in that company.  Another idea is to invest as if you were going to leave for 5-10 years and had no way to change the investment.<br />There is a repeat of at least one quote.  \\"You don't need to be a rocket scientist.  Investing is not a game where the guy with the 160 IQ beats the guy with 130 IQ.\\"  A rather encouraging thought about investing.<br />If you are looking for a guide to investing, then this is not your book.

I had trouble reading this book in one sitting.  This is not a bad book.  It is just that there many books by editors who lambast their colleagues in front of writers in an effort to sign the writers.  At first thought, McCormack seemed to be attacking other editors just to look better.<br />After completing the book, I see that is not the stance the author is taking.  He acknowledges that editing is still an art, but avers that a more standard practice and terminology is needed to better the quality of writing today.<br />To this end, he suggests a vocabulary to help editors describe what works or does not work in a novel.  One such word is the prelibation, which is the effect the writer is trying to get from the reader.  After reading his suggestions, I am inclined to agree.  McCormack also points out the contradiction in many fiction textbooks today.  No wonder we have a disparity in editing ability.<br />I would recommend this book to writers and editors.  This book will help you think about the novel in ways that can only help it become stronger.	2002-04-26

This will help you rethink your feelings about money.  I found this very helpful.  Anyone would benefit from this.<br />The next few parts of the book discuss how you can protect your money if you are struck with a death in the family, a divorce, or an accident.  For each of these, she gives you either her personal story or another persons story to help illustrate what she means.  She discusses the law involved and what you can do.<br />In the next part, she discusses buying a home and investing.  For these two parts, the text is less easy to read.  There are a lot of numbers and terms that may throw you off.  She does mention if her previous books cover the information in more detail.  Although she still gives some stories, these sections do not read like the previous.  For instance, the section on IRAs is made up of questions and answers.  Why the difference?  It makes this section appear like an afterthought.  It is still some useful information.  Do not try to read it all in one sitting.<br />The end of the book discusses charitable contributions.  This is not to discuss tax implications but refers back to the beginning by helping you to think positively about yourself and money.<br />I would recommend this book for anyone deciding to get serious about finances.	2002-04-17

Since not two dictionaries are the same, this one would be the better investment.<br />Not only does this book have the dictionary proper, and pronunciation guide and symbols, but also it has abbreviations (what does AMSLAN stand for?) and symbols of chemical elements (like Ne), foreign words and phrases (mirabilia...which would be italicized since it is a foreign word), biographical names (who was Nicholas Biddle?), geographical names (how high is Churchill Falls?), and a handbook of style (when do you use a dash?).<br />No desktop is complete without this book.	2002-04-09

This cast changes slightly from book to book, but Rayford, Buck, Chloe, and Tsion Ben-Judah are still here.  The story takes place after the resurrection of Nicolae and the indwelling of Satan.  For economic and security reasons, all members of the Global Community must bear the mark of the Beast.  Now, all the believers must prepare to hide.<br />This book, as are others in the series, difficult to read without reading the series in order.  Without understanding the history of the characters and understanding what has happened to the world, you will be lost.  Some elements of the story take a couple of books to work through, so just reading one will not allow you to see how it started or ended.  The character of Hattie Durham is an example of this.<br />I would recommend this book if you have read the preceding books.	2002-04-09

In this book, we are finished the second woe and are prepared for the approach of the Beast.<br />As in the other books, the pace is fast, so you will find yourself compelled to finish the book at one setting.  After talking with my family, I found that it wasnt just me trying to read it all at once.  Unfortunately, this results in the events not getting the description or explanation that you may wish.

The Tribulation Force learns that there may be a mole in its presence and they welcome new members.  You will also read of the first of the trumpet judgments.<br />This book, as well as the series, creates an excitement with its pacing and interest in researching the text in the Bible.  In my opinion, this serves the purpose of this series.<br />The author does get caught up a bit in the story so that the disasters coming with the judgments are completed too quickly.  Most of the trumpet judgments are over and done with in just a few pages.  Although these things are bad, we never really get to see the impact it has on the believers or non-believers.<br />Nonetheless, I would recommend reading this book as a starting point to reading the Book of Revelation.	2002-04-06

For example, it has three samples of blurring, and on the opposite page, says things like \\"blur to convey motion or emotion,\\" \\"use a blurred image as a backdrop,\\" and \\"contrast a blurred image with a sharp image.\\"  This helps the designer generate ideas for his or her creation.<br />I believe this would be a handy reference for all graphic designers.	2002-03-30

Since the Piglet book was written in 1992, perhaps we will be hearing of another such book from Hoff.<br />Although this book is almost 100 pages longer than \\"The Tao of Pooh,\\" I could not shake feeling that I did not get as much information.  There are more quotations (from Buddhist, Taoist, and Confucian texts, as well as from the Pooh stories, Henry David Thoreau, and Arthur Conan Doyle) in this book to illustrate ideas.  Hoff also uses examples of Dickens and Gandhi.  Unfortunately, I feel that there are more quotes and less discussion of their meaning.<br />Much of the discussion concerns our world as we know it.  This book has a more \\"political\\" slant to it, which makes me feel that he was getting off topic.  I understand, upon reflection, that this is incorrect because the purpose of understanding Taoism is to see it in the everyday.  The insight is appreciated, but I finished the book feeling more overwhelmed than empowered.<br />As a text to help us examine our lives, I would recommend this text.	2002-03-22

This book is more of a guide to the whole process of writing the dissertation rather than the physical act of writing.  Bolker discussing the writing as well as choosing a topic, choosing an advisor for your dissertation, and choosing a committee for your dissertation defense. Covered in the book are some of the psychological barriers that can hinder your finishing the dissertation, and some pitfalls to avoid (such as political battles with your advisor).<br />The primary thought is to develop the habit of writing.  Some of the ideas may sound familiar to you, but they are no less true.  Bolker states that you must develop the habit of writing everyday if you are going to build up the stamina and fortitude to completing the task.  She does suggest a support group to assist in this.<br />The biggest draw for this book, for me, was that Bolker is an authority.  She started two dissertations, one of which she did not finish.  She has also worked with many students in writing their dissertations, and she knows from experience what works and what doesn't (she points out a problem that can arise from writing solely on the computer).<br />I would recommend this book to anyone beginning the journey to finishing a dissertation.

That is a fair assessment.<br />The premise of the book is to show the readers that we are indeed approaching the End Times.  The authors show how technology, politics, economics, and disease all have reached the levels to meet the prophecies listed in the Bible.<br />As a whole, the book patterns itself after the book of Revelations.  Scripture from other parts of the Bible are also used to help illustrate what we are to expect before the Second Coming.<br />If you are wondering on what the authors base their series, this is the place to look.  The series also follows the chain of events found in Revelations.  Most of the chapters have a section from a \\"Left Behind\\" book in them.  I don't feel that this hurts the series if you have not read it yet.  The passages are fairly short.<br />I would recommend this book from someone who wants to understand more of what the \\"Left Behind\\" series is based on.	2002-03-14

While trying to do this, I found myself missing the key points.  Since this book was written for a younger audience, the language helps you gain a good, basic understanding of Sikhism.  After, adults, or young adults, can progress to denser texts.<br />This is a fairly short book.  Let this be an indication that it will not get caught up in philosophical discussion.  It merely gives you the facts about this religion.  It explains the history, some of the characteristics (like the 5 k's), and the special occasions (all of which seem to deal with the reading of the \\"Guru Granth\\").<br />In the back of the book is a glossary to help you remember and work with the text.

Books	4	3	5	N	N	Easy to follow	This is a very easy-to-read book that is designed to get readers to rethink their understanding of money.  Kiyosaki's examples, charts, and explanations are simple, although he points out that most people refuse to understand that they have missed an idea so simple.  For instance, he points out that most people do not understand the fundamental difference between an asset and a liability (asset makes money, liability costs money).<br />Like most self-help books, everything is not given to you.  Kiyosaki does not tell you specifically how to make millions of dollars.  He is trying to empower you so that you will understand.  This is essential since financial markets change.  If you can not learn to read these changes, then a specific plan will be worthless.  Think of it like this, you need to go to the basement to get something you want.  Self-help books, like this one, merely turn on the light for you and point down the stairs.  Only you can walk down there.<br />There are some good ideas on education.  The poor dad is his educated father (if I remember correctly, he had a Ph.D.).  He was educated for his job, and as times changed, he was too educated for the job he had, so he had to quit.  Kiyosaki points out that we do need education, but we need to be selective in what we learn, and we should never stop learning.  As mentioned before, things change and we need to be prepared for that.  Get skills that will help you in anything you do.<br />Towards the end of the book, Kiyosaki discusses donating money to charity.  This is the only spiritual aspect of the book, and I am not sure it really flows with the rest of the book.  Although I don't disagree, I feel that it undercuts the rest of this book.<br />I would recommend this book to someone wanting to work toward a better understanding of money.	2002-03-12

I wanted to see how close to the original the movie came.  Yes, it is very close.<br />The book is very heavy on dialogue.  I found this well done.  The book moved rapidly, but I felt I understood the characters involved.  It is hard to read the book without seeing the actors in the movie, because the words in the script are identical, in places, to the words in the novel.<br />Some of the characters described by Leonard are not as you would find in the movie.  In the book, Buddy (Foley's partner) is described as a white redneck.  For Mr. Ripley, the stock swindler, he has little to no part in the novel, just a brief mention.<br />If you think you shouldn't read the book because you know how it ends, you are mistaken.

The information within was taken from oral interviews of Carter and other key officials by academics after the end of the Carter presidency.  For those who merely dismiss Carter as a poor president, I highly recommend giving this book a read.<br />The book, in my opinion, does two things.  It goes into the dynamics of Carter's leadership style and also gives information about what was happening behind the doors of the White House.<br />In a couple words, policy and decision-making were handled two ways: collegial discussion and homework.  These are key to Carter's leadership.  As an engineer, Carter wished to focus on a problem, do his homework, and then join discussion about the options.  As the president, he reserved the right to make the final decision.  This follows his engineering and religious background.  If there is a problem, solve the problem.<br />The difficulty that arose from this was his reluctance of engaging in political maneuvering and his focus.  In Washington, it is necessary at times to bargain.  Carter, leading a country rebounding from the Nixon years, was determined to avoid the political battles as much as possible.  In regard to focus, according to Hargrove, his focusing on a problem kept him from noticing the connection with various other problems.<br />At the end of the book, Hargrove talks about how this leadership style worked, and did not work, in a transition presidency.<br />Also, Hargrove talks of the different agenda items (like the economic policy and energy policy) and how the collegial style worked.  More often than not, not all the departments were on the same page.  This led to the administration to appear to be vacillating.  Hargrove shows how this process worked in each agenda, which is very helpful.  I found this helped me to focus on the specifics.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the Carter presidency or anyone who didnot like the Carter presidency.  This book does have a good perspective on that time in American history.	2002-03-07

Don't let this mislead you.  Even though a few items are related directly to newspapers (like the section on headlines and captions), the wealth of information is helpful to anyone trying to better his or her writing.<br />With many grammar textbooks, the reader tries to understand correct grammar and punctuation with rules explained in a confusing manner.  The reader will re-read the rule a few times just get the basic idea.  In Walsh's book, I found the explanations clear, witty, and helpful.  I found his explanations and examples help me in developing my ear for proper grammar.<br />In the latter half of the book, Walsh has a stylebook with many common errors in writing.  Granted, some are so specific that I don't know if they would help me (like knowing that it is Elisabeth Shue and not Elizabeth Shue).  Nonetheless, I feel stronger about my grammar skills after reading this book.<br />I would recommend this book to all people wishing to improve their grammar skills.	2002-03-07

This novel is the work of a fine craftsman.  Upon reading, you feel that there are no wasted characters or scenes; all are important and work towards making a beautiful canvas for you to enjoy.  <br />In this story a young doctor, Dr. Andy Zorn, is driven from his practice in Chicago by a frivolous lawsuit against him and by his divorce.  Mr. Taggert, the owner of a chain of retirement communities, hires Dr. Zorn to manage of his properties, The Palms in Tampa, which is not making a profit.  It is at this location that Zorn must rebuild the community and his life.<br />Of the characters Zorn meets, you feel that you have met them before, but never took the time to know them.  For instance, there is Mr. Bixby who seems like just another retiree.  One day, someone notices that he is \\"the\\" Buzz Bixby of World Series fame many years ago.  All the characters, and for the matter all retirees, have had a wealth of experiences which get overlooked when we do not try to understand.<br />Michener also discusses many issues (as an aside, this was written in the early nineties) such as Alzheimer's, AIDS, euthanasia, and living wills.  There are other topics, but these seem to be the most poignant.  Throughout these issues, you will never feel that Michener is preaching to you, but you will know how he feels.<br />I would recommend this book.  It is an enjoyable read.	2002-02-27

Do you wonder if you are talking too much?  These are questions for all adult educators, and this book is a good first start.  It teaches the use of learning tasks rather than lectures.<br />Jane Vella is a trainer and an adjunct professor.  She has written past works on adult training and, at times, refers to them in this book.  The cultures and educational backgrounds of students she has taught are many, and she uses that experience.  These techniques will help educators work with that.<br />The book is a short piece that has an easy tone.  The beginning educator can easily access this without being caught up in theoretical discourse.  This is designed for use rather than reflection.  Likewise, Vella gives plenty of examples to walk you through the different steps in planning learning tasks.  In one example, she discusses an online history course.  Rather than have the student read the test and answer questions (basically enforcing rote memorization), the example asks the student to investigate how the US president gets power through the Constitution.  The question is more of an open question that invites exploration rather than a closed question that asks for a parroting of the answer.<br />Unfortunately, not all of the steps are explained clearly.  In some places, there is no example to illustrate the point.  In one instance, she mentions there needs to be critical feeling in the lesson.  This sounds like a great idea and probably the point that requires the most explanation, but there is no example to make sure the reader follows the writer.<br />There is also, in my opinion, a bit of bombast.  Towards the beginning, Vella mentions graduate students she works with who have trouble with their dissertations.  She proposes that they would have no trouble at all if they had learning tasks since preschool.  Why is this in the book?  If students were lectured on dissertations since preschool, I think they would have success in writing a dissertation in graduate school, too.  Because this statement is in the beginning, it makes me wonder if she believes she has a system or idea that will sell itself.<br />Nonetheless, Vellas book is good for the new instructor or the instructor who feels there must be a better way than lecturing; in contrast, the book may not be a good investment...	2002-02-10
US	50858933	RQH0GSOG04UAZ	1574090763	633665433	Endangered Species (Mariner's Library Fiction Classics)	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Recommended for working sailors	The \\"Matthew Flinders\\" is on her final voyage for Hong Kong to be sold for scrap, and the members of the crew are sailing to the demise of their way of life (hence the name, \\"Endangered Species\\").  En route, they rescue a sinking junk filled with people fleeing Vietnam.  There is plenty of excitement as this novel looks at the changing times and how we fight and adapt to them.<br />This is not a \\"historical\\" sea-faring novel like the Nathaniel Drinkwater series by Woodman or the Aubrey and Maturin series by O'Brien.  The book is most likely set in the 1980s since there is an AIDS reference and Hong Kong is still under British control.  The story tells of the lives of seamen in the British Merchant Navy as it declines.<br />Richard Woodman, from the information in the book, has been a sailor for a large part of his life.  His detailed descriptions of the ship show you his familiarity.  Also, his portrayal of the characters will remind you of past shipmates (if you have worked and lived on a boat as I have).  We all know the war-veteran skipper, MacKinnon, and the ne'er-do-well MacGregor.<br />There are some logical problems with the novel though.  First, the ship goes through a typhoon and finds itself in the eye of the storm.  This would mean that the crew must pass back through the storm, but this never happens.  Second, a window is shattered by the storm and someone is injured.  The window is never repaired, and there is no mention of the after-effects (like wind or noise).  Lastly, the navigation is mostly dead reckoning and celestial fixes.  I would think that a modern novel would mention other sources (like Loran or Omega).  These may be petty, but they are noticeable.<br />Regardless of these errors, this is still an engaging and nostalgic read.  I could easily see myself reading more books by Woodman, just as I would recommend that you should read this one.	2002-02-09

Many artifacts from the outside were brought back to England.  Many \\"gentlemen\\" were bringing their \\"discoveries\\" back for study.  All things needed to be explained in terms of modern-day science.  Is this Bram Stoker's response to this?  Does he feel that some things are better left alone?<br />This story was published in 1904 (seven years after \\"Dracula\\").  Unlike its well-known predecessor, this novel was not written in the journal format that does take an edge off of the pace.  This story is told from the perspective of a barrister, Malcolm Ross.  He is brought into the events by Margaret Trelawny after meeting her days before.<br />Egyptology, a common passion at this time in British history, is at the heart of the novel.  Margaret's father, Mr. Trelawny, is an Egyptologist who has made a major discovery of a powerful woman who lived over 14 centuries previous.  The story of the find is told late in the novel by him in retrospect.  More than the first half of the novel is setting the stage of the mystery and of the telling of the find.  Like today's parodies of teen horror, you would think the characters would realize that it is time to leave.<br />The climax of the novel is over in a couple of pages at the end.  I felt a little bewildered.  Even \\"Dracula\\" has a bit of a post script explaining what happens afterward.<br />I would recommend this book for Stoker fans and horror fans.  This book is stronger when you reflect on what his readers would be familiar with in the early 1900s.	2002-02-05

Personally, I do not think these are three of his best.<br />Without doubt, the collection would not make sense without \\"Dracula.\\"  It is simply the text and has no notes for the reader.  The good thing is that it does have plenty of room on the margins for making notes for your use.<br />In the late eighties and early nineties, it was hard to get a copy of \\"The Lair of the White Worm.\\"  You can know find it in paperback. After reading it, you will see that it is not exactly like the abysmal movie with Hugh Grant.  <br />Although the movie hinted at vampirism, there is no hint of vampirism here which raises the question, \\"Why include it in a Dracula Omnibus?\\"  This story brings a sentient monster that has been alive beneath England, a voodoo master, and a mesmerist.  Not too bad a combination, but it has the feel of two stories fighting each other.  Also, we witness the power of Mimi, but never really get to read much about her.<br />The final selection, \\"Dracula's Guest,\\" was published posthumously.  I don't recall seeing it in paperback by itself, although there is a hardcover edition available.  \\"Dracula's Guest\\" is typically part of another selection.  This is not a novel, but a collection of stories.  <br />Is this a worthwhile investment?  If you like Bram Stoker's work, this is a nice hardcover to put up on the shelf.  You have \\"Dracula\\" and a couple more works to boot.  Aside from an introduction from the editor, there are no frills with this edition.	2002-01-28

Just as the title says, it is simply a guide to the recruiters.  Scanlon and Hunt have broken the book into three parts for your reference.<br />First, the introduction and chapters 1 through 3 are not quite part of the book.  If you look at the page numbers, roman numerals still greet you.  This should show you that it is not the primary focus of the book.  The introduction tells you about recruiters and job searching in this field.  In the first three chapters, some good information from the authors explain resumes, cover letters, and interviews.  Knowing how the recruiters think is always a leg up on the competition.<br />The meat of the book is the &quot;directory.&quot;  This lets you know the name, title, firm, and address of Wall Street recruiters.  Remember that people change jobs and titles fairly often.  This information is merely a starting point.  Just knowing the companies out there allows me to do some research to make my application that much more appealing.  It also allows me to be more knowledgeable in the interview.  Use the information to find the current recruiter.  Don't assume the listed name is still in charge of recruiting.<br />The last part is not as helpful.  It breaks down the field into four parts (generalist, financial services, insurance, and venture capital).  Here, the authors index names with company for the recruiter with a more specialized function.  This will allow you to finetune your search, but given that people change jobs, the information here is less helpful than the addresses.<br />This book is a good starting point for your quest for a job on Wall Street, but alone, it will not be of use.  It is merely a solid starting point to find out who is out there recruiting.	2002-01-21

Not counting the appendix, there are only 94 pages in the paperback edition; this doesn't give a lot of space for the big picture.<br />The subtitle for the book is \\"An Award-Winning Author's Tips on How to Write, Sell, and Promote Your Children's Books.\\"  The key word here is tips, and it is these tips which make this a helpful book.<br />One of his tips, writing your story as a script for a children's play, strikes me as simple, yet rewarding.  Many children's books require more dialogue than narrative, so making a script requires you to view your work from a new perspective.  It is such a simple idea, but I had never thought of doing it.<br />One of his marketing tips is to use the script you wrote and market it with the book.  Schools are more likely to use a book for class if there are more things to do with it.  Creating study questions is another idea.<br />Although this was a quick-read, I would recommend reading this...	2002-01-19

Edmund Morris was the presidential historian for Ronald Reagan.  Knowing this, I thought that he was writing a book on behalf of Reagan.  Whenever Morris starting inserting his own history in the book (like his going to school overseas or writing copy for airlines), I wondered at insertion of his personal life into the book.  This is not why I bought the book.<br />After reading more, I felt that these insertions helped establish perspective on the work.  It no longer felt like an official rendition of the Reagans life.  This is when the title seemed to strike me as more apt.  This is his memoir of Ronald Reagan.  To understand his memories of Dutch, he has to include his own life into the text.  It wasnt expected, but I found that I appreciated it by books end.<br />There are some photos in the book, but not a lot.  They seem more coincidental than planned.  There are also copious notes in the back for the historians who wish to check every detail.  Morris did indeed do his homework.<br />I would recommend this book with the caveat that the reader understands that this is the authors memoir of Ronald Reagan.  Although parts seem sentimental, it is a good read.	2002-01-18

In looking at this, I thought I would be walked through the process of putting together a proposal for a book and getting it to a publisher.  That information is there, but there is also quite a bit of information about what the printer is doing.  I don't think I need to have this information.<br />The first part on writing the book was informative.  I learned about the history of children's books as well as learned what markets are present.  There are even some resources listed to help you write your book.<br />Once the book went into illustrations, I started to fall away.  The detail given in this book is not for a beginner, but for someone who is already familiar with the tools of the trade.  Do you know what a Coquille Board is?  After reading, I have a general idea, but I don't think I could point one out in a store or use one.  If anything, I have gained a new vocabulary word.<br />When the book went into the publishing process, I began to wonder why the author was taking us there.  If I sell my book, is the assumption that I will be in the printing house doing some labor?  Using some good details (like the use of Pellikan 51 Special Red) sounds great, but why do I, the writer/illustrator need to know this?  This is more the printer's job.  I don't think it was explained well why I need to know this.<br />After reading this book, I feel I understand the big picture in the creation of a children's book, but I believe I received a lot of information that is of no use to me.  Why do I need an illustration of a T-square?  Also, I didn't get a sense of closure since there is no conclusion.  I had hoped that I would get some words of encouragement, or something, from the author.<br />I would not recommend this book for someone writing his or her first book for children.  I would read it if I have already started in the field and wanted more information.	2002-01-17

Each part is designed to help you in progressing towards the publishing of a book/play/poem/story for children.  This is not a quick process.  The key ingredient to this book being successful is that the book shows you what is involved.<br />In the first section of the book, Seuling discusses the world of children's books.  This will give you an idea of the history of children's books and help you become familiar with the lingo.<br />In the second and third sections (Developing Your Ideas and Writing Your Book, respectively), she talks about some of the pitfalls (she calls sabotage) and talks about what is required for different kinds of books (for instance, what is needed for an Easy Reader versus a Chapter Book).  To help you, the author includes the titles of books that best exemplify the kind of book she is discussing.  Now, you can check out the book and see the example for yourself.<br />In the fourth and fifth sections (Selling Your Book and A Publisher in Your Future), she explains how the publishing field works.  With this information in hand, you can make your submission more professional and increase your chances of getting a contract.<br />For each chapter in the book, she summarizes the key points and gives you \\"assignments\\" which will help you internalize the material and become an expert.  The only problem with the assignments is that there is no right or wrong answer.  You will need to assume that you are doing it correctly.  If you follow the assignments, however, you will learn a lot.<br />Most importantly, Seuling has appendices that list a wealth of information on helping you become a successful writer for children.  If nothing else, the book is worth it for those lists (things like marketing information, editorial services, references, and reviews of children's books). I would recommend this book for anyone thinking of writing for children.	2001-12-31

Personally, I don't think this one is a good as the first.  Also, the way the characters just happen to be getting the key assignments and just happen to know the right people can seem like a bit of a stretch.  I found the first book to be more believable than this one.<br />Judging from the title, I thought I would see more things about the force.  We see the creation of this force, but I really didn't get the feeling that they did anything.  The pastor, Bruce, asks Rayford, Chloe, and Buck to join saying that there needed to be a small group who helped each other.  It never is really explained why this group should be the members.  Why create a name like \\"Tribulation Force,\\" if it is just a group of people helping one another.  The name hints that they should have some higher purpose.  Given the jobs of Buck and Rayford, this could happen.  Unfortunately, the book never really explains this.<br />The book seems to focus more on what the individual members are getting into.  Some of them had information which may have helped the others, but none of them seem to grasp this, so never shared the information.  If the members of the group are so close, then why don't they speak up?  For a group meant to support each other, they do not seem to meet each other very often.<br />Would I recommend the book?  Yes.  After reading the first, I still want to read the rest.  The pace of the book keeps me excited and turning the pages until I am through.	2001-12-29

Perhaps Heinlein himself was thinking of Twain when he wrote it.  Unfortunately, he is not Mark Twain.  <br />When Twain wrote, he talked of even a simple thing, like going through customs, and made it humorous.  When Heinlein writes about going through customs, he is merely telling you how annoying it is in different places.  He talks about how different countries should make customs easier for travelers or else the country could lose money.  This kind of goes without saying.  I would hope that Robert would tell us a bit more on his interpretation.  I really don't need his opinion of economics.<br />This book feels more like a collection of musings rather than a well thought out book.  Some of the incidents sound like they could be interesting or witty, but Heinlein just touches on it and continues on.  The only thing I really found amusing was his persistence in looking around the seedier places of each town.<br />If you are not a fan of Heinlein, and then I would, emphatically, not recommend this book.  If you are a fan, then I would recommend it just to say you have read it.  It is a dated book and does not make a lot of sense today.  Read it just to see what his reaction to the world is.	2001-12-29

He covered Clinton as a governor and wrote this book to give others some perspective on the figure of Bill Clinton.  This particular book was written while Clinton was serving his first year in office as president.<br />Does the book offer anything new?  In 1993 or 1994, it did.  The author discusses the different issues that arose for the Clinton presidency and gives some explanation on what happened.  He then puts Clinton's handling of the issue into perspective based on what he knows of Clinton in Arkansas.  By reading the book, you see that Brummett does not seem to be surprised by anything he saw that first year.<br />He does not cover Clinton's childhood; this book is not really a biography in that sense.  It is merely an explanation of the first year in the White House.  Would I recommend reading the book?  Only if you were doing a research project on Clinton.  This could give you some insights.  Otherwise,  After watching Clinton for eight years,  you probably already have an idea of how Clinton handles political issues.	2001-12-29

The book does not go into deep exposition and dialogue.  It does not explore the intricacies of each character.  This keeps it from being great literature in my opinion.<br />It is a good story though.  The pace will keep you turning the page and have you wanting to read the next book.  I found it best to read in a couple of sittings.  The story begins with the believers being called up.  The authors tell you about the catastrophes that happen as people have suddenly disappear.  Some, like the main characters of Rayford, Chloe, and Bruce have lost family members.  The book shows their reaction when they realized that they are now on their own.<br />Another character, Cameron (Buck), is a journalist who tries to find an explanation for all of this.  You follow him as he asks different people on their explanation for what has happened.<br />Reading the book does generate an interest in the book of Revelations. Just remember that this is an interpretation of the book.  It is not a substitute. <br />I would recommend this book with the warning that once you have read this one, you will really want to read the rest of them.	2001-12-29

After reading the book, I am a little disappointed that the book was written not by him, but by Dr. Cutler, a Western psychiatrist.<br />Dr. Cutler is not a bad writer.  This is his research and interviews with the Dalai Lama.  He talks of personal interviews as well as some of the Dalai Lama's speaking engagements.  The chapters typically start with Dr. Cutler preparing to ask a question.  Then, the Dalai Lama responds to the question.  Afterwards, the doctor explains his interpretation and response to that answer.  It is interesting to have the Eastern response compared with the Western response.<br />If I had to sum up the book in one sentence, then I would say, \\"Compassion is the key.\\"  There are exercises in the book that are designed to help us build our compassion.  To be honest, I did feel calmer after reading this book.	2001-12-29

Simply having a sample test and a list of all the works of literature that you could be tested is not helpful.  Although these tests were not created by ETS (the makers of the GRE), REA did base the tests on past subject tests.  This also gives you some guidance on what, and when, to study.<br />This book contains three samples tests and some drills.  For the tests, the answers are explained so you know which answer is right as well as why the other answers are wrong.  This is a big plus in studying.  The drill questions are designed to see if you are learning the information from the study pages in the front.<br />The study pages are helpful.  They discuss the main ideas and writers for the different periods of literature.  As most books, they recommend going to the work itself, but if you do not have time, this information is helpful.  With the writer, you get what the person was famous for, and if that work was very influential, what the main ideas of it were.  It also discusses the major theories of literary criticism.<br />With the study pages and the tests is the timeline.  I think this is the under-rated part of the book.  It is designed for eight weeks of study, but it mentions that it could be condensed to two weeks.  Although it is rather general, it still provides you with a guide to help calm you through the stress of studying.<br />I would recommend getting this book to help practice and prepare for the GRE Subject Test in Literature.	2001-12-06

Inside, there are zombies, vampires, were-rats, werewolves, and ghouls. The setting is in the future where society is trying to come to grips with the legal status of supernatural beings.<br />Anita Blake is actually an animator (raises people from the grave for a price), but due to circumstances, has created a reputation as a vampire killer.  She is also working with the local police department's special squad that investigates crimes, like murder, to supernatural beings.<br />Given this, you would think that the vampires would hate her.  Actually, some of them recruit her to solve the mystery.  Unfortunately, Anita, and the reader, never gets a clear explanation of why she has been chosen.  There are some clues, but for the most part, the rationale is unknown.<br />Nevertheless, her search for the killer takes her to a vampire \\"strip club,\\" the Circus of the Damned, and a freak party (where humans go to be \\"teased\\" and bitten by vampires).  She comes across a vast array of characters that makes it difficult for the reader to keep track of.  I recommend not putting the book down, or you will be lost when you pick it back up.<br />The book is told from her perspective.  The tone is that of a sassy detective who is seen a lot and won't take crud from anyone.<br />To be honest, it reads like a vampire, Harlequin Romance.  All the cover needs is a vampire with his shirt torn, exposing his pale, undead (yet firm) muscles.  I would not recommend this to someone wanting something \\"new.\\"  The book feels trite.	2001-12-05

Looking at the title of the book, I thought this book would be a collection of myths.  Upon looking at the list of other titles by Edith Hamilton (like \\"The Greek Way\\" and \\"The Roman Way\\"), I felt that this would be more of the history of mythology.  This book is a blend of these two ideas.<br />The book is not organized to be a quick reference.  It tells the main stories and characters as well as gives a brief section on the minor figures.  For each section, the author explains where she is getting the material (for instance, from Homer or from Ovid) with a little editorial comment.  Then, she relates the myth.  She is giving you the story, but it does not read like a story.  It reads like a college instructor giving you the highlights of the story with the occasional comment.<br />Although the bulk of the myths covered are either Greek or Roman, Hamilton does include some Norse mythology.  Given the difference in worldview difference, I would like to have seen more contrasting of the differences.<br />I found this book to be a great review of the Greek and Roman myths.  I found that the differences between the Greek and Roman interpretations of the same basic myth to be very interesting.  It is not a substitute for reading the myths themselves, and for this, Hamilton does mention the authors and, sometimes, the play or poem.  I would recommend this book.	2001-11-30

This will mean more to you if you are familiar with the names.<br />The examples are good pictures with some information (who did the work and whom it was for), and they have a brief paragraph explaining what the creator were thinking about the project.  In some cases, it is very enlightening, but in others, it just seemed like reminiscing.<br />I recommend this book for people with designer training, but not for the beginner.	2001-11-25

Like me, you may not know exactly what to look for in the examples shown.  Included are book jackets, catalogs, calendars, posters, and other creative designs that you can look at for ideas.  Unfortunately, they are just pictures so the detail does not always come out as you might hope.<br />There are no explanations.  With each idea are the client, the art director, and the creative firm.  Sometimes, it will list the designer.  <br />Unless you know what you are looking at, and can see the different elements of the whole as well as how they interact, then this book will not be very helpful.

This book is intended for those of us who need to put together a flyer, presentation, or newsletter, but we don't have the background in design.  The design the author refers to is the design of the printed page.<br />The author explains simple principles that help us see what makes for a good design like proximity, alignment, repetition, and contrast.  There are plenty of before-and-after examples to show you exactly what she means.  The explanations are also very understandable.  Williams does not preach to you, but rather helps you see the different elements which can make the visual more effective.<br />There are also some quizzes with answers in the back.  Included is a short bibliography so the reader can get more information if he or she chooses.<br />There are some problems with the book.  One, it discusses the use of color, but there are no color pictures to illustrate the point.  The author knew the illustrations would no be color so asks you to visualize this in your head.  It wasn't the most helpful here.<br />Also, towards the end, she uses some editing/printing jargon that she never explains.  If the reader does not have a design background, why mention leading if not explained?<br />Overall, I find this book to be very helpful.  Knowing the elements I should be looking for ensures that my experimenting with flyers is more productive and effective.  I would recommend this book to anyone needing to create newsletters, flyers, and the like.	2001-11-24

The author shows you all the different people that are involved in the creation of the book.  With each person, he gives you a chapter discussing what he or she does and some of the tools he or she uses to do it.  From reading this, I now have a much better understanding of what it takes to put a book into my hands.<br />The book is not immersed in techno-speak that slows down the reading.  The flow of words is easy and understandable.  I never became lost in the process or found myself going back.  It is a solid book.<br />I would recommend this book to all aspiring editors as well as aspiring writers.

It is part autobiography, part history of publishing, part lament, and part prediction.  At times, it provides a romantic view of editors and what they wish to accomplish.  It then shows where the publishers of today are not keeping with this view.<br />For the most part, however, it provides an analysis of why things don't work they way they should.  Although it seems as if Epstein is crying about it, he couches this in language that shows how the whole publishing industry remains in a state of flux and that this is just another view of this flux.  <br />The book has good flow, and it is a quick read.  If you read New Grub Street and felt emboldened rather than defeated, then this is the book for you.	2001-11-20

For printing pictures, the book also illustrates the four-color book.  <br />The story follows the creation of the book Green Beans by the author to the time children have it in their hands.

These are the three which get the bulk of print spent on them.  You see that Perkins was much more than an editor and went to great lengths to help these writers discover as much of their potential as possible.  He never wanted to credit for these and felt that the editor should always be hidden in the background.<br />Aside from the authors mentioned above, I found that Perkins also assisted authors like Bourjaily, Jones (&quot;From Here to Eternity&quot;), Rawlings (&quot;The Yearling&quot;), and Sherwood Anderson (although there was a bit of a falling out).<br />A. Scott Berg inserts a lot of information into the text, yet it is still very readable.  Even in sections when I felt there was more Thomas Wolfe than needed, I still went through the book without wanting to put it down.<br />Even if you are not big into editing, just to hear a &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; view of some of your favorite authors will make this book worthwhile to you.	2001-11-12

By some accounts, I am a little old to be enjoying the trials and tribulations of Mole, Badger, Toad, and Water Rat.  This is one of the books you hear about always, but may not have had the chance in childhood to read this (or have it read to you).<br />The book starts with Mole and his journey from his house to the River.  There, he meets the Water Rat and the reader is introduced to the ways of animals in this world.  Everyone is very polite and there are rules of interaction between the animals.  For instance, there are some things you do not ask questions about.  All these rules seem to be from an era that has passed.  It is refreshing to read about it though and wonder how long ago people were this friendly and civil.<br />The story of Toad is maybe the most dated.  Toad is excitable and gets caught up in the newest fads.  Today, we may not see Toad as being a burden to his friends or the bad seed.  We may see him as the rebel who goes after what he wants and has the adventures.  Would we censure him if he were one of our friends?  <br />Whether the manners are dated or not, this is a very relaxing and fun story.  There is a little bit of fighting involved, but not too bad.  I would recommend this book for anyone wanting to read about a more innocent time.	2001-10-29

When we think of tales of pirates and buccaneers, we can not help but thing of Captain Flint and Long John Silver.<br />Why this edition?  Although this is by no means a keepsake, it is an inexpensive and well-done edition.  It is unabridged and has an illustration of the treasure map as well as illustrations from other scenes in the book (such as Jim Hawkins' meeting Ben Gunn).  It is easy to carry around when you are out on vacation or doing some hiking.  You can't do that with a keepsake.<br />The story is written in narrative fashion, mostly from the perspective of Hawkins, but sometimes from Dr. Livesey's point of view.  Either way, it is fast paced and hard to put down.<br />I would recommend this edition to anyone not willing to invest in a hardcover keepsake.  You can not go wrong.	2001-10-25

Growing up in the South, the cadence of his writing is familiar to me and easy to read.  For me, it is a lot like one of my relatives talking about the days when they were little.<br />This book is not the typical autobiography, and the organization does not flow like a biography does.  Although the book follows a logical pattern for the most part, the are a couple of sections where he goes back and forward in time which slightly disorients.  This adds to the narrative because it has more of the feel of someone actually telling you this while you sit out on the porch after supper. <br />He discusses conversations with his Uncle Buddy who tells him about the early generations of the family.  The reader will get a sense for how far back the Jimmy Carter's roots in the South go.  Carter is showing you his sense of history and perspective to help you understand where, and when, he came from.  The recollections don't come at the beginning of the book where you might think, but rather later as a kind of side note.<br />He also does explain things in a bit more detail.  For instance, he talks about farming when he was young.  Not only does he tell you how difficult it could be, but he also discusses briefly how government programs and the economy affected that particular way of life.<br />Knowing the world that Jimmy Carter grew up in is enlightening.  It does add to my respect for the man.  I would recommend this book to learn more about Jimmy Carter, but also to see what the South was like from the perspective of someone who lived there.	2001-10-24

Yes, we know that we have ethics, but do we ever examine them and question ourselves?<br />Halberstam takes a look at the ethics of friendship, romance, and conversation.  He looks at where moral questions arise in these situations.  He is does not make the judgement in stating what is a wrong or right way. More importantly, he points out where morals are evident in these situations and asks how we manifest our ethics to the world.  By reading through this, you can not help but look at yourself and question the perception that you thought you were exhibiting.<br />In the end of the book, the author talks about common pitfalls that we fall into when defending our ethics or in questioning others.  He also gives some ideas in how we can go and improve/strengthen our own sense of moral behavior.<br />The only thing I have against the book is that it is written in the early nineties and some of the language is left over from the eighties.  It does not make it less true, but it does make some of the examples a little dated.<br />I would recommend this to someone with no academic background in moral philosophy, but wanted to learn more.  This is a great introduction into the study of ethics.	2001-10-24

First, is that it is unauthorized which doesn't mean that the author does not have to &quot;sugarcoat&quot; Harrison Ford.  Sounds like a great book.  Second is that the book is unauthorized...conversely, the author does not seem to have spoken with Harrison Ford.<br />Unlike other unauthorized biographies, this book doesn't make a big production of it.  The author is not trying to sell this book on scandal.  The sell is on the picture behind what you usually hear or read.  From going through the notes, the author has interviewed quite a few people and has gone through a lot of background information to create this.<br />The book reads easily, and I don't find myself questioning the author.  All his statements about Harrison Ford, like his being a perfectionist, follows from the supporting evidence.  The author also does not jump around.  It all flows logically.<br />Harrison Ford is an American movie icon.  This book allows you to look at the experiences and attitudes which got him there.  If you are a fan of Harrison Ford, then I would suggest you take a deep breath before reading.  The author is not trying to make him into a saint.	2001-10-21

Although this book is not about the two sisters of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the primary characters are two sisters (which will remind you of Jane and her sister), Elinor and Marianne Dashwood.  Again, as in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the underlying theme is marriage. There is a lot of misunderstanding due to partial, or erroneous, information.  The sense and sensibility is shown in how the sisters handle the different predicaments.<br />The cast includes, among others, the sisters, Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and John and Fanny Dashwood.<br />This edition has the complete text and not much else.  The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book.  There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult.  It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.<br />I do recommend this book.

I have wanted to read the classics of English literature since I did not do so during college.  Because I am not in college, I do not have any need to have an edition with critical essays and copious notes about different versions of the book.  A simple book with the story in front of me was all that was necessary.  Wordsworth Classics filled the need quite satisfactorily.<br />This edition has the complete text and not much else.  The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book.  There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult.  It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.<br />The particular story starts with the famous/infamous line \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\"  Given this, and given Jane Austen, you know that you are in for a tour of marriage in old England.  Austen's sketches of her characters are so well done that you can't help but hear the dialogue in your head in the voice's of people you are familiar with.  Jane Austen understands how people work and is a very astute observer of human nature.<br />In these pages you will follow the trials and tribulations of Jane and Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and the rest of their families and acquaintances. The read is well worth it.  The reading is engaging and will keep you turning pages.  I would heartily recommend this book.	2001-10-17

While preparing for the GRE Literature in English test, I have been using this book to get a good background on the great writers.  At the end of each entry, there is a small bibliography which will give you a headstart in further research should you choose to do so.<br />I would recommend having this book on your personal shelf for your reference.

In the last book, the city of Castledown attacks their party and splits them up.  Now we see the group of magical warriors fight against technology from a civilization which destroyed itself long ago.<br />The mixture of science fiction and fantasy works well I think.  There is the occasional error where a warrior from the land of magic knows what something is called here; for example, Quentin Leah looks at an opening and calls it a ventilation duct.  Do they have ducts in the realm of Shannara?  For the most part, the world of science is referred to more general terms to show you that the warriors are not familiar with what they see.<br />The book, as are most of Terry Brooks' books, is like reading a serial movie from the first half of the 1900s.  You will find yourself reading continuously so that you can find out what happens next to the different parties as they struggle to find each other.<br />I am looking forward to the next book to find resolution between the Druid, Walker Boh, and the Ilse Witch.  Since this is a part of a series, you have the ending which hints of even grander things to come.<br />If you are not a Terry Brooks fan, you will find yourself lost in this book.  You will need to be familiar with the Shannara series to understand this.	2001-09-22

The first clue to the usefulness of the book is to look at the publisher.  This is from ETS which runs the GRE.  Although the company wants to assist you, I don't believe it is in its best interest to tell you how to beat the test.<br />First, they give you general information about the test such as how it is administered and what the general percentage breakdown is (so many interpretation questions, so many diagnostic questions....).  Then, they give you a section with sample questions of the different question types they have.  Lastly, they give you two sample tests.<br />The problem I have with this is that there is no explanation of the answers.  You can check to see if you got it correct (and check how your score ranks), but you can not see why a particular answer is correct or wrong.  For that reason, I would recommend other titles for studying purposes.<br />The main positive for buying this book is that the questions are coming from from the creator of the test.  You know that by taking this, you are seeing questions similar to the ones on the test.	2001-09-21

The dominant thing I learned was that I was not going to do well.<br />Upon a recommendation, I bought the Princeton Review to see if there was a &quot;system&quot; for studying for the test and for taking the test.  Although the method, the Two-Pass System, seems common sense, after reading through the explanation, you will feel a bit more confident in your abilities and knowledge.  Trust me, with 230 questions to go through, any amount of confidence is helpful.<br />For the recommended studying, this book mentions the &quot;points to page&quot; ratio.  This means that if a work will show up in many questions on the test, then you should spend time studying that work.  If something might get asked, they will mention it in the explanations on the sample test (there is one and it is very well-done explanations of the answers - correct and incorrect).  By reading through these, I immediately recognized many questions that I had taken on previous practice exams.  This let me know that this book was a very wise purchase.  <br />I would recommend this book.  The list of titles to study listed by other companies, is much too disheartening.  The others merely list all the works which might be one there, whereas the Princeton Review ranks them on their A, B, C, and D lists.	2001-09-20

Although this book has some summaries of nineteenth century authors, I would not call it a survey.  If anything, it is a paraphrase of what you should have remembered from a survey class on the major novelists in English of the nineteenth century.<br />Is this a helpful book?  Many of the authors I read while in college and some afterwards.  In preparing for the Literature in English test, I realized that I didn't remember as much as I would have liked.  This book gives you a brief summary of the author's life, a list (with dates) of the major works, and a summary of the most important works.  The author, Rosemary Gelshenen, also gives a brief explanation of why the particular author is remembered.  She covers, the Brontes, Mary Shelley, Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, Trollope, Eliot, Kipling, Stevenson, Hardy, James, and Conrad.<br />Reading this is by no means a substitute for the books, but it is a quick, and humorous, read which will enable you to feel a bit better about your grasp of the nineteenth century novelists and some of their contemporaries.<br />I would recommend this book for a quick study of this time period.	2001-09-20

I hate to be the odd reviewer out, but I was not as impressed with this work on the life of Jane Austen. Not being familiar with the Penguin Lives series, I thought this would be a biography. After reading the book, I am not sure I would use that classification here.<BR>As mentioned in other reviews, this book is readable. Also, there are some flaws in the text (possibly editing error). My fault lies more in the research given to the topice. In the introduction, Shields mentions that she is a writer, but paints herself as more of an amateur enthusiast. There is nothing wrong with this, but if I am reading about the life of Jane Austen, I want to know that the author has researched it (and yes, this is a daunting task).<BR>Here bibliography mentions bibliographies and biographies she has read about Austen. In the text, she mentions letters, but doesn't always quote from them. Where did these letters come from?  Knowing this would add some authenticity to the book.  Some of her quotes, like a poem written by a brother, don't always seem the best choice. In this case, the poem doesn't always give me the best insight to Jane Austen that one of the other letters may have.  If a surviving letter has some insight, I would like to see a quote from that letter.<BR>A lot of the research for the book seems to have come from the novels themselves. The idea seems to be that Jane Austen wrote this because experience &quot;x&quot; was happening in her life. This is conjecture, hard to confirm due to the lack of letters surviving, but conjecture nonetheless.<BR>Any biography you read on Jane Austen will have a sizable bit of guesswork to it. Without seeing the material that Shields is drawing from, that bit seems to be bigger than I like to think.<BR>I would recommend this to someone introducing themselves to the work of Jane Austen. For the literary student, I would probably give this one a miss. I don't regret reading it, but knowing what I know now, I probably would have read one of the other biographies.	2001-09-14

The formula for this paper reminds me of &quot;Interview with a Vampire.&quot;  Unfortunately, it feels like a formula written book.<br />The basic premise is Pandora, one of the older vampires, has met David, a newer vampire who has been in earlier Rice books, and he has asked her to write about her creation.  This book is her writing to David about how she was called to Akasha, how she met and &quot;married&quot; Marius, and where she originally came from.<br />The book starts with a few mentions of Lestat and earlier books, then ends with more mentions of Lestat with the hint that she is going to find him.  It seems more like a pause in the telling of the story of Lestat.  Not that this is bad, but it is not engaging as her first two books.  <br />It is difficult to feel any kind of connection with Pandora.  She mentions in the beginning that she doesn't want to write, writes, then tells us she doesn't want to write anymore.  Although Rice does a good job in the settings of New Orleans, Rome, and Antioch, the story as a whole never sets.  You can easily put this down and pick it up later.<br />This is a bone thrown to the vampire fans.  Unfortunately, there is not a lot of meat on this bone.  I enjoy the continuing stories of Rice's vampires, but she is having a hard time living up to what she started.	2001-09-09

Most of her work has exotic desriptions of the surroundings which only warrants a read.  The reader also has the feel that she has done her research and nows her topic (not just the setting, but the character, and the mythology).<br />Not here.<br />Although I loved the places the narrator, Triana, describes for us (her home and Vienna especially), I really didn't feel the plot move at all.  The majority of the book is almost an argument between Stefan and Triana over who gets the violin.  I understand the need for conflict, but this was a bit too long for an enjoyable read.<br />When I read of Rice's witches, vampires, or mummies, I am intrigued to hear about them.  Stefan is a miserable ghost.  What is the point of his remaining locked to Earth?  I agree with Triana that I am puzzled.  I now how, but no idea why.  The insertion of Beethoven into the mix seemed like a quick device to keep the book moving.  I really don't know the significance of it though.<br />If you want to follow Anne Rice in her exquisite settings, by all means read the book.  If this is your choice for an introduction to Anne Rice, please don't read this one.  She has some great stuff out there, and this is not it.	2001-09-07

My wife and I just completed a tour of some of the major cities of Spain.  Before we went, we purchased this Lonely Planet rather than the individual city guides.  Since we were part of a tour and merely wanted some supplemental information, we purchased this one.<br />The information they give on each of the sites and monuments is helpful.  Although it didn't go into intense detail, you did get enough background historical information to make some sense.  This book also gave us some good ideas of sites to see which the tour we took did not tell us about.<br />Some of the information is a little inaccurate, don't take this information as 100 percent correct.  For instance, admission to the Capilla Real is 350 ptas and not 300.  The hours were a little off also.  We did find the maps to be pretty accurate.  The walking tour of Madrid was a little more difficult to follow, but it could be done.<br />A fellow traveler had the Let's Go book for Spain and Portugal.  Consistently, we found her looking at our Lonely Planet for better information.<br />I would recommend this book for a trip to Spain.  Remember that it is supplemental and should not be taking as 100 percent accurate.	2001-09-05

I have started to read a bit on Browning and decided to get an idea of his poetry.  Given the price of this book, this was a good choice.<br />Browning covered a lot of ideas, and all are written very intelligently.  Reading through this book though, may cause you to scratch your head.  If you read it, enjoy each selection rather than try to read straight through.<br />This is what I mean by the arrangement; I poem on the killing of a loved one (Porphyria's Lover) precedes the Pied Piper of Hamelin.  The jump in ideas can slow you down a bit.  The arrangement is logical in that the editors printed the poems in groups according to the collection they were originally published in.  These collections, in turn, are arranged in chronological order.  This is good because you can watch Browning's work as time progresses.<br />There are 42 poems in this selection.  It does include the great ones (I will abbreviate titles) like Andrea del Sarto, Caliban upon Setebos, Karshish, Childe Roland, My Last Duchess, Fra Lippo Lippi, The Bishop Orders His Tomb, Johannes Agricola, and others.<br />I would recommend this book for reflecting on the occasional work of a great poet.	2001-08-16

This book is part of the Routledge Author Guides and was published in the early 1970s.  <br />The book is divided into decades of his life.  Each chapter covers a new decade and the work he published in that time.  There is also a chapter to provide context on his life, and another chapter on Browning's influence with modern poets.<br />Every poem or play is not covered.  Gridley covers the major works and collections, although mentions many others.  His primary aim is to show the reader/scholar how Brownings work was changing during his life.  The author gives you commentary for nineteenth century critics and other writers of the time.<br />Although not a biography, there is some basic information on Brownings life.  This is primarily to give some context to the poetry he was writing.<br />This is not a difficult read for the scholar.  There will be lots of names mentioned (like Chesterton, Lyell, Tennyson) and occurences (like the repeal of the corporation acts) which would require some background to fully understand.  It is not indepth, so if the reader has an encyclopedia handy, this will be no problem at all.<br />Gridley does go into some of the major works.  I found his coverage of &quot;The Ring and the Book&quot; to be helpful.<br />I would recommend this book to others wanting to better understand one of the most influential poets from the nineteenth century.	2001-08-15

According to the introduction, Lovecraft took three years to research his project, read numerous works, and write the paper.  Also according to the introduction, Lovecraft was a very slow reader.  If this is true, he must have devoted quite a bit of time to his research.  It leads me to believe that all the books mentioned were all the books he read.  What did he miss?<br />This essay is part explanation of what horror is and a reading list of the discerning horror reader.  He gives a good definition and then shows you how other readers fit this definition.  He arranges this piece to show you the progression of horror from its beginnings in folklore to modern times (which would have been the 1920s).  He mentions quite a few, but not all get the coverage that the great ones get. For instance, Poe gets and whole chapter and Hawthorne and Bierce receive a good bit of coverage.<br />If you are not a reader of Lovecraft, it may take you a minute to acclimatize yourself with his style of writing.  The fan of Cthulu will easily slip into the flow of words.<br />Lovecraft never really covers anyone he truly doesn't like.  He does criticize some writers, but there is no in depth writing against someone.  This work is primarily positive.  I would recommend getting this for the reading list alone.	2001-08-13

OK, the title for this review may be a little harsh, but the image is hard to shake from my mind.  Imagine the close-ups used in a soap opera to show you the intense anguish and inner turmoil the characters feel.  Usually, there is pensive expressions which sometimes border on the ludicrous.  In &quot;Women in Love&quot; I can't help imagining Lawrence using the same thing.  There is a narrative, there is action, but a lot of the book belongs inside the characters.  We see Gudrun looking out at the snow covered valley with a feeling of awe, we hear Birkin go through endless thoughts of the ineffable thing he is looking for but can't state clearly, and we watch Gerald trying to find the next big problem he can solve.  Throughout all this ruminating, we, the viewer, must be watching something.  Hence, we look at the soap opera close-ups of the Brangwens, Criches, and Birkin.<br />This is not a bad book, but not a book which moves me like others of Lawrence.  This book was a continuation of &quot;The Rainbow,&quot; but it does not give you the span of time.  The novel is primarily focused on Ursula, Gudrun, Rupert, and Gerald.  I miss seeing how things work through time.  You still have elements from Lawrence's other novels (like dancing uninhibitedly with nature), but it seems as if he is giving us too much information on just a few people.  I feel he has more effect with &quot;The Rainbow.&quot;<br />I agree that you do not need to read &quot;The Rainbow&quot; first.  Lawrence is a thorough writer, so many times I found myself rereading passages to better understand what he is trying to tell me.<br />The Wordsworth Classics are inexpensive, but they do not have a lot of room in the margins for notes.  This is a good volume to buy for a read, but not for a study.<br />Although you do not need to read &quot;The Rainbow&quot; to read this, I would recommend reading &quot;Women in Love&quot; if you have read &quot;The Rainbow.&quot;  It is interesting to watch how Lawrence develops the women after giving you their history.	2001-08-12

This is a good, inexpensive introduction to Gerard Manley Hopkins.  There is a brief section talking about Hopkins and how much of his poetry was lost.  This gives you an idea of who is giving you this poetry.<br />For the poetry student, the Author's Preface is essential.  Here, Sprung Rhythm is explained.  If you are not a serious student of poetry, this will probably be lost on you.  It is not necessary to read the poetry, but to understand Hopkins' style, it is a must-read.<br />The poetry itself is filled with religious and classical images and allusions.  If you are not well-read, like me, you may not get every thing that Hopkins is explaining to you.  There are some notes in the back, but these are limited.  I have no doubt that Hopkins is intelligent, but I will need to do some extra reading to fully understand all of this.<br />I think this is a great read.  It is not a quick read by any means.  This is poetry which is read again and again to get a full understanding.  I would also recommend reading this aloud.	2001-08-04

Since the title is &quot;World War One British Poets,&quot; I thought that the collection would be from poets who served in the military.  Not only do the editors give you that, but they include male poets which did not serve (Kipling, Hardy, etc), but also two female poets (Alice Meynall whose son-in-law served and died, and May Wedderburn Cannan who served with the Red Cross in France).  This provides a bit more background to the time period.<br />These poems aren't all about the horrors of war (like Owen's &quot;Dulce et Decorum Est&quot;), but are also about the honor and pride felt by the British soldier (Brooke's &quot;The Soldier&quot;).  Granted, some of these poems were not meant to be recruiting devices.<br />Although there are some great poems in this book, the biggest plus is the price.  For less than two dollars (US), you are getting a fairly good cross-section of British poets writing in WW1.	2001-07-30

I first read &quot;If We Must Die&quot; in a Literature class in college.  Not knowing anything about Claude McKay, I saw this asan almost &quot;athletic&quot; speech from a coach to his team.  It had that kind of a feel to it.  In doing some research, I found that McKay was speaking of the injustice African Americans felt in America in the early 1900s.  <br />This collection is not just the selections about racial injustice.  There are also poems about his home in Jamaica, his job in the constabulary force there, and love.  Through these diverse poems, you will get a better picture of McKay and his time.  There is not a lot of biographical information listed in this book.<br />I would recommend the book.  The first few poems are written in a Jamaican dialect which may make it difficult to read the first time.  I found that reading it out loud opened the meaning and pronunciation for me.  It is a good read.	2001-07-28

This book is not a quick read if you wish to take something from it.  Like most Buddhist writings, it is divided in to smaller parts for discussion (like &quot;Old Age,&quot; &quot;The World,&quot; and &quot;Happiness&quot;).  Within each of these parts, there is an explanation trying to illustrate this idea of the reader.  It is not intended to be scanned.  If you read one of these sections a day (they are usually one or two pages), just reflect on that.  You will walk away with a much better understanding.  It is designed to assist your personal meditations.<br />I think it is a quick translation because I sometimes feel that &quot;Western&quot; words come into the translation rather than the intended word.  For instance, I think &quot;temple&quot; would be a much better translation than &quot;church.&quot;  It would keep an Eastern feel to the writing.	2001-07-27

When I first heard of this book, I thought that it was a work of fiction.  Given my basic knowledge of the Victorian era, I didn't think anyone, much less a writer, would stand up and talk about addiction.  Alas, I was wrong, but do not regret reading this in the least.<br />Although this book is short, about 70 pages for this edition, it is not as quick a read as you would think.  His vocabulary can be quite extensive and to fully understand him, you have to have his background in Greek (the language and mythology) to understand his allusions.  His writing seems to approximate a conversation with a very intelligent, but distracted, person.  Many of these sentences (especially in the beginning) are quite long and filled with commas and colons.  It is like the intelligent person trying to tell you something important, but as he speaks, he is not sure that he is being clear, so he adds little phrases to try to illustrate his point more effectively as he leans forward earnestly in hopes of adequately trying to prove his point.<br />Within this piece, he talks of his background and why he started taking opium.  He debunks many commentaries on opium use and explains why.  DeQuincey also mentions other famous people who took opium (or laudanum).  Lastly, he tells of some of his dreams which were &quot;enhanced&quot; by his opium taking.  After reading these descriptions, I find myself looking at the work of Coleridge in a new light, and even the fictional character Sherlock Holmes.<br />I would recommend this piece to any wanting a better understanding of DeQuincey and his time.	2001-07-26

If you are a fan of ghost stories and have a collection of books on the subject, you probably already have all the stories in this book.  I will not list them all since another reviewer has already done so.<br />Although all of the stories deal with ghosts (well, &quot;The Monkey's Paw&quot; is arguably not a ghost story, but spooky nonetheless), most of them do not deal with a malevolent spirit bent on our destruction.  Only &quot;The Judge's House&quot; and &quot;A Ghost Story&quot; deal with an angry spirit.  The rest are tales of ghostly happenings, but nothing like you might find in a horror movie.<br />Given the price, I would recommend this to someone who does not normally read a lot of ghost stories.  Otherwise, you probably have these in your collection already.	2001-07-22

The Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics edition is an attractive edition with plenty of space in the margins for making notes.  Also included with the main text is a fragment of &quot;Sisters II&quot; (which would become &quot;Women in Love&quot;), a chronology of the happenings in &quot;The Rainbow,&quot; some explanatory notes, and a list of further reading.  For the scholar, this is a handy text.<br />I am not sure if this is the best edition to read however.  In reading the introduction, the history of revisions to the text by Lawrence, his wife, editors, and copyeditors lets the reader know that this was &quot;corrected&quot; many times.  Unfortunately, the editors never really keep to one interpretation.  From reading this introduction, it sounds like they tried to incorporate all the editings of everyone who worked with it.  After reading this, I could not help wondering if what I was reading was from Lawrence or from some &quot;well-meaning&quot; editor.  Possibly caused by reading this, I found the flow of the book to be sometimes off.<br />Without knowing the title, you would know it is Lawrence right away.  It is not as concise as &quot;Sons and Lovers,&quot; but is a good read nonetheless.	2001-07-22

This small book contains 12 of Ambrose Bierce's short stories (The Eyes of the Panther, The Moonlit Road, The Boarded Window, The Man and the Snake, The Secret of Macarger's Gulch, The Middle Toe of the Right Foot, A Psychological Shipwreck, A Holy Terror, John Bartine's Watch, Beyond the Wall, A Watcher by the Dead, and Moxon's Master).  The stories cover ghosts, revenge, and otherworldly messages.  This is by no means a definitive collection of Bierce's work, but it is a good, inexpensive introduction.<br />The stories are short and do not go into intense detail and background.  These are compact and complete enough to be told around the campfire or just around the living room with the lights turned out.  Bierce knows his reader and will often give the ending an unexpected twist.	2001-07-20

This book is literary criticism about some of America's most famous writers.  Basically, it is a &quot;Lawrencian&quot; reading of classics.<br />D.H. Lawrence comments on Benjamin Franklin, Melville, Hawthorne, Dana, Fenimore Cooper, Poe, Whitman, and de Crevecoeur.  In doing so, he is trying to get a picture of what America is and what it is trying to do.  Although he mentions his interest in some, all fall short of the mark of creating a new identity for America.<br />If you have ever read notes by Lawrence on some of his novels (like &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover&quot;), you will see the repeat of a lot of ideas and language.  This was written later in his life, so it does make sense that some of his ideas of the blood-relationship would come again.<br />I would not recommend this book for people trying to understand American writing (except maybe to use this as contrast), but I would highly recommend this for anyone studying D.H. Lawrence.  This will give you another perspective (aside from his fiction).	2001-07-16

He even talks about life on the boat.  Throughout the book is also illustrations and pictures to give the reader some background and/or enjoyment.<br />This is not a book I would pick up to read unless you were familiar with Mark Twain's writing.  I found his commentary and tales to be very funny.  This is a pleasure to read by all Twain fans.	2001-07-16

When I thought of &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover,&quot; images of some late night cable movie came to my head.  Because of this, I thought of this as just a novel by Lawrence but not something which was really indicative of his work.  I was wrong.  This is a very good book.<br />As in &quot;Sons and Lovers,&quot; Lawrence uses the scenery around the characters to give you an idea of something deeper than the interaction between Clifford, Connie, Mrs. Bolton, and Mellors.  Flowers play another large role is showing you what he means.<br />Yes, there is frank talk of sex in the novel.  I do not find it crude as the history behind the book would lead you to believe (but then, I am reading it over fifty years after it came out).  The way Lawrence deals frankly with his characters in their mannerisms and speech is pure art.  Even if you have never been in the exact situation that these people are in, you can see things and experience emotions/frustrations that affect you now.<br />At the end of the book is a short section from Lawrence discussing what he was thinking when he put this work together.  For those wanting to see a bit more into Lawrence's mind, this is a great treat.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.	2001-07-12

I purchased this book wanting an inexpensive edition of the Arabian Nights.  When I saw this edition was illustrated by Maxfield Parrish, I knew this would be a good one.  Unfortunately, I can't shake the feeling that I am missing something in this edition.<br />I know that this is not the full collection of tales.  I was disappointed that the editors didn't give us much of the framework that the original was set.  There are only ten stories here, and they are not really linked together at all.  It is more like reading an anthology than reading a coherent piece of literary work.<br />I also felt that something was missing in the translations.  Although Allah is mentioned, they typically refer to God.  Whether this is what the originals stated or if this is how it was translated by western scholars, I don't know.<br />When I saw this was illustrated by Parrish, I had images of his work throughout the book.  Unfortunately, they are grouped together in a couple places with a small quote from the story they represent.  Some of the pictures seem like they were created for something else, but looked close enough to work.  Although the art is good, it doesn't fit into the book very well.<br />The flights of fancy are fun and this would be appropriate for children.  I don't think adult readers would want this one.	2001-07-09

The Wordsworth Classics are a fairly good editions of some of the classics.  Being mass-market paperbacks, they are easy to carry around.  The only problem I would have with this is that there is not a lot of room in the margins for making notes about the text.  There is some room, but you would need to write small.  I would recommend this edition above others if you just wanted to read the story with really studying it.<br />D.H. Lawrence wrote this in a time which also saw Sigmund Freud start with his writings of Oedipal conflict and motivation.  A reader from today will start thinking about how much fun Freud would have with this within the first few chapters.<br />I would have to say that I have not read a lot of D.H. Lawrence, but this book has convinced me to read more.  The actions Paul, the main character, takes tell you what is happening, but if you look at the imagery of nature around them, you will have another idea of what is going on.  Lawrence is a great writer.  Look at the flowers when Paul and Clara have finished walking the slippery path by the river.  Look closely at the flowers that are given to Clara when they stop for tea.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone.  If you are a student, I might recommend using a journal for your notes or getting a used copy of another edition which has larger margins.	2001-07-09

The basic part of the story is about a man who has been framed for the murder of powerful, local businessman's daughter.  The main theme seems to be a bit larger than that however.<br />As a &quot;lawyer&quot; story, it is ok.  I found the routine they follow to get the evidence and make a case to be interesting.  Much of it seems too good to be true though.  For instance, they find a former soldier who helped frame the accused years ago.  He agrees that what he has done is wrong and decides to clean up his ways (enters AA and tells the truth).  This is a bit too easy.<br />The larger picture is about Christianity and how it affects us.  We see it personally in the lawyer's life and in the accused.  Running counter to this trial is a church prayer group who records all the prayers and results.  There is too much detail given for these sessions for this to be a side issue.  These sessions, and how they turn out for the trial and the lawyer, are the main focus for the story.<br />If you are looking for an intense crime story, you should probably look for someone like John Grisham.  If you are looking for a religious story about inner triumph and the power of prayer, then this book is for you.	2001-07-02

This book does show Irving as a very meticulous writer.  Given the size of this book, Irving is adept at keeping all the pieces together.  Everything fits.<br />The problem I had with the book is that everything fits.  Not because it is a very polished work, but because I could see what was coming and how it would work.  Once I had a good idea of who was who, I see that I am only half way through the book.  There is no sense of wanting to turn the pages to see what is coming up next.<br />I really like the character of Daruwalla.  The notion of being a stranger in your own home is fascinating and Irving's linking this to the image of the circus is well done.  As a writer, it is hard to find fault.<br />As a study of his Irving's writing, this is a good book.  As a real &quot;page-turner,&quot; I find that this novel falls a little short of that mark.  If you have not read Garp, then I would recommend reading that instead.	2001-07-02

A business friend of mine recommended that I read this story to gain a better understanding about how the world of the Internet and venture capital work.  I will agree that the story kept me interested.<br />The narrative is written by Lewis as he is reporting on, and following, Jim Clark.  Clark is the quintessential Internet entrepeneur.  We see his beginnings as well as a glimpse of what he is doing now.  We see him as a counter version to Bill Gates.  Whereas Gates assembles his team, then works his plan to the finish, Clark seems more to assemble the team, then let the go from there while he goes to do something else.<br />Clark is a visionary and seems to be well ahead of his time.  Many of the ideas he has (like TV shows on demand), came long before the public was ready for it.  Because of his presence, many people buy into it when there is no market ready.  Clark seems to lack the saavy necessary to show people what he has created.  From the book, it appears that he simply loses interest and keeps going.<br />As a text on trends, I found this a bit alarming.  The thought than venture capitalists will sink enormous amounts of money into a project just because someone says so is scary.  The idea that others will emulate Clark to gain capital is frightening also.  If you are interested in working in the world of the Internet, I would highly recommend this book to give yourself a good picture of the names which are driving this forward.	2001-07-02

When I think of Andrew Jackson, I think of the Battle of New Orleans more than anything else (including his presidency).  Knowing that the battle would be covered, I decided to give this book a try.  To my surprise, that battle was only a small part of this volume.<br />There is quite a bit of information about how Andrew Jackson became the general to fight in New Orleans.  There is some talk of his boyhood, but most of it covers his growth as a politician, stateman, and general.  Remini explains all the connections which Andrew Jackson had which helped him to get to be general and to be one of the greatest citizens of Tennessee.  This is not to take away from Mr. Jackson at all.  He was a lot more cunning and daring than I thought.<br />I was also amazed that Jackson was very ill for a long time.  Nonetheless, he continued moving forward and displaying a shining example of fortitude.<br />Also, Jackson's part in the growth of the United States is fully shown.  I had no idea that a lot of expansion was due to his efforts to free up land for the settlers.  In retrospect, his attitude towards the native Americans was harsh, but the nation gained a lot of international respect through his efforts.<br />I would recommend this book for American history buffs.  If you feel that you understood the Louisiana Purchase or the souther part of the War of 1812, then you should read this book.  It is very well-written and easy to follow.  It will keep your interest.	2001-06-27

As I read the introduction to the book, I found myself wide-eyed that I may be wrong about my knowledge of Paul Revere.  The folklore of his midnight ride (and the song) has strongly influenced what I thought.  Fischer addresses that, then writes a great narrative to show you the true patriot.<br />First, I knew that Paul Revere rode to warn the colonists and Dawes rode as well.  What I did not know was that they were part of a vast communication network set up by Paul Revere and his colleagues.  The reader sees how successful this is (even with Revere being captured) through the explanation and maps of the troop movements.  <br />The book is not a biography about Paul Revere though it does go into some detail about him.  This book is primarily about the incidents leading up to the ride and the incidents immediately after.  The reader will hear about all the things going on within that span of months.  Paul Revere's perspective is not the only one covered.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone with an interest in American history.  You will finish the book feeling enlightened.	2001-06-27

It is not the typical western European country, but nonetheless has held its own.  I did not realize that Britain played such a big role.<br />Although I learned a bit about the government and economy (and through this, a little about the population), I did not see much about the humanities and arts.  The author does mention that as the country was getting gold from its colonies, it built some beautiful buildings.  Nothing else was covered.  I would like to know more about the arts, and this book does not give that.<br />The book is also not the quickest read.  Given that it is a history, I would like things to be in chronological order.  Birmingham will follow some actions a few decades forward to show the outcome, but then jump back to where he was without comment.  This makes the flow a little distracting.  I found myself jumping back a few pages to try to follow the narrative.  Not the easiest of tasks.<br />If you know nothing about Portugal, this book will give you a brief glimpse which will get you on the right path to understanding Portugal, but it by no means gives you the most authoritative or the most readable history.	2001-06-27

In buying this book, I thought I would find a list of ways to put the training together.  Horton's book brings a lot more to the reader.<br />First, this book does not give you code to use for building the training.  Although he will mention the a helpful hint in using a particular code here and there, he does not give you long lists of things to cut and paste into your module.<br />This book provides you with a reference for all the things you, as the creator of the training, should be thinking about.  It is not overwhelming with theory, but rather is a series of bulleted lists of tips, ideas, and suggestions for preparing your work.  This is easy to read and has many examples (pictures) of what he is talking about (there is also a website and each chapter comes with a list of other places to go for information...not to mention the list of references in the back).<br />Horton explains what web-based training is and helps you to evaluate whether web-based training is the best route to go for your needs.  He discusses how to market your training as well as how you can lay it out to make it user friendly.  He has his own training programs that he does so all his methods have been tested.  This lends a lot of credibility to the author.<br />Before reading this book, I was still thinking in terms of text and quizzes.  Although he does mention these, he also gives you different ideas in how to present the information.  This keeps training different and exciting.<br />I would highly recommend this book for any trainer, or educator, who is interested in pursuing, or experimenting, with web-based training.	2001-05-29

Unfortunately, man doesn't think to truly understand the ramifications until things get out of hand.  The government does recognize this and attempts to blame the &quot;witches.&quot;<br />Farrar walks the reader through Wiccan ceremony and thought without making it sound like a manual.  He shows us that there are practitioners of black magic as well as white.  Similarly, he shows us that there are good and bad government people.  Overall, he was very even-handed in his depictions.<br />Without giving anything away, this is a science fiction novel about a future catastrophe and how people work to overcome this event.  Although it is not going to win any awards, it is a pleasant read for a rainy afternoon.	2001-05-08

Reading the subtitle, you would think he is going to focus on the University of Phoenix and the growth of the Apollo Group.  After reading the book cover to cover, I am not sure what the author wanted me to take away from this. <br />Some parts of his life get rather detailed (like his childhood sickness and early schooling) and could be interesting.  His tone makes me think of someone on a pulpit trying to get me to acknowledge his past.  I would not question the effects of his past if he didn't fly through other parts of it (all the quick affairs/relationships/friendships) which he mentions.  His son is part of his company, so I was puzzled to see that there was little mention of him.  <br />Given the sections that Sperling highlights for us, am I supposed to be awed by the rough start and many love affairs?  Am I to be astounded by his success because of this?<br />I personally liked the history of the University of Phoenix.  He does go into great detail on the political and legal wrangling with the accrediting board.  He touches on the help from some people, but will then mention later that the person no longer had the &quot;fire&quot; and was let go from the company.  It sounds like the university is his quest and he will not let marriage or friendship get in the way.<br />In the last sections of the book, Sperling talks about other projects he is passionate about.  How did he decide to cover these?  The Kronos Group took me by surprise.  I saw no mention of this in the book until the very end.  I have the feeling that the publishers were trying to make the book longer, so they just added some other thoughts in there.  It does make for a very coherent picture of Sperling.<br />I have listened to the author speak before and find him fascinating.  Reading the book gives me a different picture of him altogether.  Either way, I would recommend the book for readers wanting a background on the creation of the University of Phoenix.  Even though this is by Sperling, I would not read this for a good understanding of him.  I believe some objectivity would be necessary for that.	2001-03-31

I had gone to India and visited the monument to the Salt March and saw pictures of Gandhi with Nehru at Nehru's home.  While I was there, the people of Delhi celebrated the birthday of Gandhi.  This led me to want to learn more about Mahatma.<br />This book does not disappoint.  First, I found that Mahatma was one of the many names that people created for him.  It was not his born name.  This book started with a brief explanation of the area, Gujarat, where Gandhi was born and raised.  You learn some about his early family life.<br />The recurring theme I noticed was that Gandhi was always studying and trying to understand more.  He experimented and was not ashamed to admit when he was wrong.  He was truly a man of peace.<br />I did learn about some of his less than saintly traits. One mentioned in this book is that he would hold others to the same strict requirements (diet, labor, etc.) that he himself would do.  He felt that if he could do it, others could to.<br />This book does not strive to show you what a saint Gandhi was or that he was some kind of flawed angel.  It does show you that we truly worked to set the example for India to help it become independent and self-sufficient	2001-02-05

The language wasn't particularly difficult nor was the print very small.  At first thought, it seems like a very simple tale.<br />Not so.  Like Hemingway's &quot;Old Man and the Sea&quot;, a simple story is telling us story but the emphasis is not on the beautiful scenery and the clever characterization.  The story is what will hold the focus and open a wisdom which is simply stated, but very deep.<br />The book is about following your dreams.  Some of the key points are that it doesn't come without pain and misfortune.  Even though the world may be conspiring to help you, it will not be easy.  There will be the beginner's luck and there will be the seeming loss.  You must remain focused and listen to your heart if you want to reach the goal.  Many times, the shepherd boy had wealth and thought of settling for that.  He felt he had the money to buy some sheep and go back to what he knew.  He didn't however, which leads me to think that this fable is not about personal wealth.  The fact that treasure lies at the end of his journey is more allegorical than literal.<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who would like a happy ending and anyone who want affirmation that we can be rewarded for following our dreams.	2001-01-06

Not that it would affect content, but it does make me question it.  The author's brief bios were on the front and back inside covers.  The one of the back had about a word on each line cut out.<br />I mention the authors' biographies because it makes me think there may be an agenda here rather than an objective biography of one of our presidential candidates.<br />Vocabulary alone lets you know that the authors do not like Gore in the least.  Many of the facts, and they are facts, can easily be compared to those in other biographies.  We know that Al Gore did these things.  Personally, I don't find this different from any other politician, but the authors want to push you to anger at the thought of Gore in office.  I get the feeling that if it was any Democrat, these guys would write just as much with just as much anger.<br />If you like to read extreme views, this will certainly whet your appetite.  If you are looking to make an informed decision, give this one a skip.  After reading, you know get the feeling like you should wash your hands.	2001-01-02

The author explains the world in which Al Gore grew up.  It describes pieces of his father's life in a way which shows you where Al picked up many of his mannerisms.  You will see where the candidate came from.<br />After reading through this, I know that Al Gore is not as Green as his book would lead you to believe.  He does listen to businesses and has accepted money.  This is no different than any other candidate.  This book brings all of this to your attention so that you can make your own informed decision.<br />The tone and flow are good.  I had no trouble following the narrative or understanding what point the author was trying to make.  Too often, an author has his own axe to grind and steps away from informing the reader so that the reader can make his or her own decision.  Turque's style makes this a good read.	2001-01-02

As opposed to some of the other George W. biographies, it wasn't readily apparent whether the author was a fan of the not-yet president-elect.  This adds a bit to the objectivity of the book.  I feel I could believe the author.<br />I did think that she spent a bit more time than necessary at times talking about his father George and his brother Jeb.  It is understandable that they do have an influence on W (the book points out where some ideas and phrases were borrowed for the father's and the brother's campaigns while W was running for governor), but I think the author went into more depth on them than was necessary.<br />One of the major factors in W's credibility is that he was governor of Texas.  I don't think that the author spend enough time there to really give us a good idea of how his actions in office match his objectives for his campaign.  I thought this could have used a bit more coverage.<br />Not the best biography out there, but I would still recommend reading it. When rea	2001-01-01

Bush And The Making Of An American President	Books	5	54	61	N	N	A Much Better Written Biography Than Most	Most biographies I have read seem to have a definited lean towards the subject.  Either they like them or they don't.  From the reputation this book got by being dropped from a more mainstream press, I expected this book to be very radical like some of the other political biographies.  This one was obviously done by a professional writer who knows how to craft a biography in such a way that the reader will stay involved.<br />Hatfield praises the things that George W. has done well and has given you a good picture of the Bush background.  He also points out the things which don't seem to add up (specifically, George W.'s volunteer work back in the 70's).  After reading the author's train of though in the Afterword, you find yourself questioning why no one has thought of this sooner.<br />If you are reading to find dirt or scandal, just read the Introduction parts and the Afterword.  That is where you read of how the book was burned by the original publisher (even after it was doing well and they vouched for the soundness of the research) and how the author was hounded by press and others.  Hearing this, you would wonder why they just didn't ignore him.  Instead, there seems to have been a conscious effort to keep the book off of the shelves.<br />From the Bush biographies and autobiography I have read, this is probably the best one.  The author takes him time to explain relevence (which sometimes require and jump to the future to explain where it will lead or a jump to the past to explain why it seems odd that Bush favored a particular legislation) without giving the reader a sense of vertigo.  It flows well and is entertaining (not funny, but it engages you to keep turning the pages).<br />I would recommend this for the people who voted for and the people who voted against.  This is well done.	2000-12-24

In this story a doctor of hematology (world-renown) discovers an abnormality with a baby in Romania.  She is helping to assist the numerous children found in the Romanian orphanages from the early 1990s.  She adopts this child and takes him home with the hopes of saving his life.  While in the States, she discovers that his condition creates a biochemical which could save the world from AIDS and cancer.  The story will include her fight to save the child from the &quot;vampires&quot; with the help of a ex-priest and a sworn enemy of the &quot;vampires&quot;.<br />Like the book &quot;I Am Legend&quot;, Simmons explains vampirism not a some mystical ailment, but a condition brought about biochemically.  This is why I say &quot;vampires.&quot;  They do not have the elongated teeth to allow them to tear open the veins.  These people will use knives to open the wound, then will suck the blood as needed.  Their bodies produces a chemical/anti-virus which uses the blood to repair their own bodies.  Some of the explanations of this do tend to carry on a bit, but it does give you the impression that Simmons studied the terminology of blood and anti-viruses.<br />Simmons has done his research (and acknowledges the Vlad Dracula scholars of Florescu and McNally) on the historical figure of Vlad Dracula.  If you have read many of the legends and histories, some of this may strike you as incorrect.  It is hard to say whether Simmons is wrong or right since there is a lot of conflicting information in the history.  It does add a nice flavor to the book.<br />If you are a vampire fan or a fan of the historical figure of Dracula, then I would recommend this.  If you are a fan of the romantic vampire, this would appear as sacrilege.	2000-12-03

When reading this book (and listening to Al Gore speak), I see that he is an intelligent man and has done quite a bit of research.  I know he was a journalist, but you wouldn't think it by reading this book.<br />I felt he had a lot of good ideas.  The idea of a new form of the Marshall Plan to help guide the world to more environmentally safe commerce and production was great.  Some of his plans, although simplistic at times, make a lot of sense.  Many of the ideas he gives are ones that are still being debated today (like trading clean air credits).<br />When I noticed that this was written in 1992/1993 when he was first running as the vice president, I was suprised.  It is not often that a politician will make such pro-environment and long-reaching statements if they are trying to get elected.  He also used the book to take punches at former President Bush.  I am sure he had more than one goal with this book.<br />I mention that it was not well-written.  This is because many of his analogies make no sense.  His comparison of parallel computing with democracy, although a bit more understandable, left me wondering why he brought it up.  The book could use some tightening up.<br />He brought a bit of spirituality into the text, but not a lot.  I am assuming that he targeted the average American for this book which would explain his language and his constant use of metaphors and analogies.  Unfortunately, they don't always work and people may wonder why he is telling them about the scientific study of the sandpile.<br />I found it an enjoyable read and showed me that Al Gore will think like a leader.  He will not always (he is a politician) choose the best path for the future and not the best path for the present.	2000-11-20

When I noticed this book on the shelf, I saw the word YETI in large letters and took it to be another book with a cryptozoological bent.  That isn't what the book is about though.  It is about his quest for an answer to his question of the Yeti's origin.<br />This is a quick read.  Primarily, this is because his descriptions of the territory and his travels throughout the mountains are fascinating.  Just hearing about how he goes from culture to culture and lets us know what Tibet is becoming was interesting.<br />Not until the very end of the book are we sure what Messner thinks of the Yeti.  Of course, from his narrative, he doesn't know what he thinks until the end.  He has the hypothesis that the yeti is pure myth with a basis in reality.  He believes that the local bear, the chemo, is the basis for these myths.  Myths are real in that they shape the local beliefs and culture.<br />Obviously Messner is intelligent.  He is able to speak many languages.  Unfortunately, I found his jumping from term to term concerning the yeti to be confusing.  After reflecting on the book, I think that is pretty indicative of the whole yeti myth (which Messner may be trying to tell us).  No one can agree on the terminology or characteristics of the yeti. This is part of the myth.  The characteristics and name will change from culture to culture.<br />If you are wanting to read a book on the yeti.  This would be a nice change of pace from the average X-Files type of story about the yeti.  As a general travel book, this is a fairly entertaining read.	2000-11-15

Although it was interesting and there is something to learn here, I didn't get the feeling that I was getting an exhaustive study.<br />I did learn a bit more of the social background of the accusers and some of the accused which I found to be very helpful to understanding this dark time in our history.	2000-10-31

You get the feeling that he took his time to masterfully craft the story.  Not here.<br />In a few places in the book, I get the feeling that the author didn't thoroughly reread the work.  I don't want to give away anything from the story, but in one instance, a character &quot;absorbs&quot; some sickness and passes out.  In the next paragraph, someone is going to talk to them.  How can this happen with that person being unconscious?  Maybe I am nitpicking, but I got this sense in more than a couple of places.<br />I would still read this book and recommend it for all Terry Brooks fans, but this is not a book for the first time reader of Terry Brooks.	2000-10-31

I would not  recommend them for scholarly work in the least.  But, they are good for a  leisurely read.<br />The Wit and Wisdom is a collection of aphorisms taken  from the the pages of the almanack.  In terms of background information,  there is some (minimal) biographical information about Benjamin Franklin  and even less information on the almanack.<br />The adages are aranged by  general subject.  Some of the aphorisms will seem familiar since a couple  are repeated in the book under different subject headings. <br />I like that  the book gives you some quick words of wisdom which can still be applicable  today.  It also gives one a brief glimpse of what the late 1700s thought of  as important or problematic.<br />It is worth the dollar.	2000-09-07

Although there  is some interesting information, I really don't feel prepared for my trip  by reading this book.<br />In this book, the author mentions the many  festivals and religious events, but keeps the descriptions minimal.  I now  know when they are, but I really don't think I understand them.<br />He also  mentions the many places you will want to go and how you will want to get  there.  Many of these are so general that I really don't know why I would  want to go there.  Granted, botanical gardens are wildlife preserves are  pretty.  I want to know why I should go to one rather than another.<br />For  me, who will be going to Delhi, this book was not of much help.  Stacey  covers the entire country which I believe is what kept all the descriptions  very general.  This is a book I would recommend reading if you know nothing  about India.  It is not a book I would take traveling with me.	2000-09-05

There are  some good, classic ghost stories in here, but some stories don't seem to  belong here.  After finishing the book, I had the impression that they  wanted a certain number of stories so insert some by women writers from the  period whether the story met the criteria of ghost story or not.<br />The  story about the Strid is one example of this.  No where in there is there a  ghost.  It is a spooky story, but no a very good one.  Seems more like some  practice story that was being written.<br />There is a story about a family  who move from Townsend's End to Boston in a house the father found at a  bargain.  Evidently, the house is haunted and has scared off previous  renters.  This is pretty formulaic.  The author ends the story with a twist  which doesn't follow.  I don't want to give away an ending, but I was  disappointed.  It read like a student paper where the student realizes they  have already passed the 750-word limit and now just wants to end the  thing.<br />The story about the train clerk and the story about hand are good.   They could easily be told to ghost enthusiasts everywhere without feeling  embarrassed.	2000-08-29

He is a junkyard dog in that we should not fall into  routine and expect the same horror story over and over.<br />Pieces like  &quot;Umney's Last Case&quot; and &quot;My Pretty Pony&quot; seem more like  exercises in different styles than the reader is used to.  There is also  the non-fiction piece &quot;Head Down&quot; which is about a Little League  baseball championship from many years back.<br />Don't get me wrong, if you a  fan of Stephen King's writing (not just of horror), this is a good book.   There are also notes in the back which explain where he go the idea for  most of the stories.  For aspiring writers, this is probably not a detailed  as you'd like, but is good nonetheless.<br />For diehard horror fans, there  are a few stories that will chill you as only Stephen King can, but quite a  bit of this book may feel unnecessary.  I would recommend borrowing the  book.	2000-08-21

The key to this book is the subtitle &quot;My Life as a Negotiator.&quot;  He does have some good stories, but I read the book based on the quotes from the back cover.  I see such names as  Larry King, Larry Bird, Ted Turner, and Armand Hammer and think this book  must be great.<br />Then, I find out that he has either represented these  people or has worked with them.  That does detract a bit of respect by  me.<br />His main idea is to go into a negotiation prepared and to remember  the Golden Rule.  He lists 101 tips for negotiating, but you don't see them  until the end of the book.  Some of them kind of sound alike and the  example he uses sounds familiar.<br />I think there is some good ideas here,  but by reading his examples (which is you weren't following business,  sports, and entertainment in the 60s, 70s, and 80s, these examples may be  lost on you), I felt that unless you were going to be a high stakes  negotiator, then this book wasn't for you.<br />As I said in the title, there  is some good info, you just have to work for it.
