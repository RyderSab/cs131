Girls, instead, read \\"Little Women\\", \\"Betsy-Tacy\\", and \\"Anne of Green Gables\\".  Ask a boy to read any of those series, and they'd gag. Those girl books, however, are still great contributions to the literary and imaginative worlds.<br />***  So even though Tolkien hasn't reached me until now (and well past my childhood years), \\"The Hobbit\\" is a rewarding pleasure.  It's the prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy (\\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\", \\"The Two Towers\\", and  \\"The Return of the King\\") and considered gentler and more suitable for reading to young children than the subsequent installments.<br />***  The Hobbitt is Bilbo Baggins who leaves his comfortable abode (his hobbitt hole) to go adventuring with the wizard Gandalf and a party of dwarves who have a penchant for breaking into boisterous singing during mealtimes.<br />***  They're off in search of treasure with little more than an old map and a lot of gumption to guide them.  Bravery emerges in a disarming way.  Tolkien understands the homeliness of his hobbitt and the dwarves -- the sort of quality we, the readers, have as humans but spend a lot of time concealing as uncool.  So when adventure prods the timid and the inexperienced into derring-do, we are swept along like participants ourselves.  Tolkien shows that even the littlest, unlikely ones have a place with the heroes...	2002-02-27

If you haven't read \\"The Fellowship of the Rings\\" first, don't even try to read \\"The Two Towers\\" (or this review) yet.<br />*** \\"The Two Towers\\" immediately picks up where \\"Fellowship\\" left off. The fellowship -- including Aragorn, Legolas the Elf, and Gimli the Dwarf -- is separated from Frodo who journeys to Mordor without them. Aragorn and the others are not at a loss for adventure, however. The first major battles are fought against the dark forces of Saruman and new allies are forged in the process.<br />*** While essential to the epic and not-to-be-missed, \\"The Two Towers\\" is noticeably weakened by the absence of Frodo in the storytelling until two-thirds of the way into the book. But fear not, \\"Frodo lives\\" and does appear again. He remains involved in the major thread of the epic, and the book definitely perks up with his return.	2002-02-27

The following review is for people who wouldn't want the reviewer give away the big spoilers -- particularly regarding a certain Ringbearer you well-know and love.  But as you can imagine, the fates of the Fellowship of the Ring, Saruman, and Sauron are finally played out in this third and last installment of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.<br />*** Aragorn faces his royal legacy, the hobbits serve valiantly in the battle against the Sauron, and the Quest of the Ring to Mount Doom is given a fitting conclusion.<br />*** Tolkien's trilogy wraps up in a somewhat unusual manner. Many will find the latter part of \\"The Return of the King\\" to be superfluous and lacking the fire of the earlier action. But thoughtful readers will appreciate what Tolkien has to say.<br />*** The Lord of the Rings adventure is immense and life-changing to its players -- particularly for the hobbits who never imagined themselves so far away from home and so instrumental to the forces of the world. Tolkien's final chapters are about coming home again and realizing that you have a responsibility, wisdom, and talent to bring to everyday life.

This is particularly useful when facing the prologue to \\"The Fellowship of the Ring\\" (the first book of the trilogy followed by \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return of the King\\").<br />***  Tolkien uses his prologue in \\"Fellowship\\" to give more background about hobbits as creatures and their history.  You have to delay satisfying your appetite for adventure while Tolkien gives you this important set-up.  --  Have patience!  You will be rewarded.<br />***  Hobbits and dwarves are physically not unlike people -- except for the height difference and the mortality rates (humans are taller and shorter lived).  There is a rustic beauty in Tolkien's cast of creatures.  They pass on their stories and traditions through song and folklore.  But there is also magic at play -- for good and for evil.<br />***  The basic story is this:  There is a Ring, created by dark powers and once thought to be lost, that is now in the innocent possession of a young hobbit named Frodo.  The Dark Lord, Sauron, sends his servants, known as the Ringwraiths or the Nine Riders, to reclaim the Ring from Frodo.  Thus pursued, Frodo engages the help of three fellow hobbits (including the ever-faithful Sam) and learns that the fate of the Ring will determine the fate of the world itself.<br />***  Tolkien creates a very detailed epic.  Admittedly, readers may be discouraged by the prospect of all the names and places.  However, the basic story is never lost.  A helpful trick is to see yourself in Frodo's shoes.  The young hobbit is confused himself, but always in the thick of the action.  He meets up with amazing companions like Gandalf the Wizard and the heroic Aragorn, and finds refuge in the idyllic elven realms.<br />***  Danger lurks and strikes in one adventure after the next.

His father was the owner of the London bookstore on 84 Charing Cross Road (later made famous by Helene Hanff) which makes Leo uncannily literate.  He was not above pretending to be the heir to the Marks and Spencer fortune (he wasn't), but beneath all the precociousness, Marks is a genuine brain and worth the listen.  <br />***  Deemed unpromising at the start of his WW2 intelligence career, Marks lands in the SOE (Special Operations Executive) instead of the now-legendary Bletchley Park and promptly butts heads with his superiors.  Considering the uninspired nature of his bosses, however, it's no wonder that Marks is just the young upstart they would never admit they needed.<br />***  The SOE prepped secret agents to be dropped in France and other Nazi-occupied countries and maintained coded communications with the agents during their time in the field.  (Bletchley monitored enemy-coded communications.)  It was a very risky sort of business with amazing loopholes.  Good coders didn't always make good agents and vice versa, but Marks did an effective job of getting the good agents to elevate their coding prowess or access hidden potential.<br />***  What's perhaps most extraordinary about Marks' story is that his SOE stint was an office commute job, for which he endures a lot of bureaucratic grief and some serendipidous research and legwork to get things rolling.  Although far from the physical front lines of armies, tanks, and military manuevers, Marks was certainly on the front lines of undercover agents and cryptology.  The intricacies of good security are endless.<br />***  He advocated new methods of coding which would allow more secure communications and less risk for agents.  For example, he came up with the idea of printing coding lists on silk which would allow agents to hide them in their clothing.  The silks would be harder to detect than wads of paper if the agentswere caught and searched.  But this is a simplified version of what Marks was really working for.  Read the book and get a much more in-depth look at what it's all about.  Marks usually gives it to you in bite-size pieces, and even when the information gets too thick, you're still left with a general sense of what's going on and the stakes involved.  It's \\"between silk and cyanide\\" -- saving an agent with coding silks or risking their lives and enemy capture, and taking that fatal pill issued to all agents to keep them from talking.	2002-02-27

The story centers on a woman who must deal with the loss of her husband's life and then the realization that he led a double existence totally exclusive of her.<br />*** It's an intriguing premise, but it doesn't allow much room for the rich texture and atmosphere generated in &quot;Fortune's Rocks.&quot;  To be fair, the latter is an Edith Wharton-like tome, whereas &quot;The Pilot's Wife&quot; is a contemporary story that would make an intelligent film, the kind starring Michelle Pfeiffer (who was in the adaptation of another Oprah pick, &quot;The Deep End of the Ocean&quot;).  Liking one book, readers may not like the other, but both show Shreve developing a surer hand and an increasingly impressive dramatic range.  <br />*** Always, there is a sense that the central character must cross (and often re-cross) logistic distances in order to achieve emotional discovery or fulfillment.  Shreve accomplishes this with a lot of grace and modern sensibilities, leaving the paths of self-righteousness and sentimentality to romance novelists.	2001-11-21

In her Pulitzer Prize winning &quot;No Ordinary Time&quot;, Doris Kerns Goodwin quoted some interesting excerpts from Winston Estes' novel.  I was intrigued to find out more and tracked down &quot;Home Front&quot;.  Unfortunately, the Goodwin's well-chosen excerpts were the only good things from Estes' novel which was a big disappointment.<br /><br />*** Estes' focuses on the small town community of Bentley near Atlanta, Georgia where things move slowly and not a whole lot happens except for church gatherings and whenever trains pull into town.  When WW2 comes along, you can hardly tell the difference except for the heavy-handed sermons on the merits of the war.  The writing style is simplistic and very reminiscent of Reader's Digest stories, and the characters are wooden and aloof.  Even the war can't provide Estes with a real plot.  Spare yourself the agony of searching for this book, much less actually reading it.	2001-11-21

In &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; first published in 1875, Collins focuses on the plight of Valeria Woodville who unwittingly marries a man previously tried for poisoning his first wife.  Evidence and testimony could not convince the jury of his guilt or innocence, and an unusual Scotch verdict of &quot;Not Proven&quot; is handed down.  He assumes a new name and conceals his tainted past when he marries Valeria.  She, however, proves to be a very perceptive and resourceful woman who discovers the truth on her own.  Unshaken in her love, she vows to clear her husband's name and reputation in order to secure their future happiness. <br />*** In his signature works, Collins often frustrates the reader's patience with his lengthy narrative style.  But &quot;The Law and the Lady&quot; moves along surprisingly well.  Despite some ridiculous and dated perceptions about the sexes (Collins frequently has characters and Valeria herself remark that she's &quot;only a woman&quot;), Valeria's actions prove she's admirably keen and the one to get things rolling.<br />*** Collins should also get points for introducing the outrageously campy, scene-stealing characters of the lunatic genius Misserimus Dexter and his devoted, but moronic cousin Ariel.  Missing both his legs, Dexter scoots around either like the &quot;new centaur&quot; (half-man, half wheel chair) or on his hands like a &quot;frog&quot;.  It's this added element of circus freakshow that effectively ruffles the otherwise creaky Victorian setting.	2001-11-21

The scenario plays out more plausibly than any Danielle Steele confection.  Time and again, what is most astonishing about any story set in WW2 is how remarkable things happened because of ordinary people.

The unofficial leader of the four is Conway, a British embassy relations-sort of man.  Rather than being outraged, Conway is content in the serene and spiritual surroundings.<br />*** None of the female characters ever develop beyond a paragraph or two, and the scope of the plot only involves arriving at and possibly leaving Shangri-La.<br />*** The prologue and epilogue to the story, however, are very well done and extend the mystery of Shangri-La.  Does this place truly exist?  Are people able to prolong their lives in spiritual and intellectual enlightenment?  Was Conway just spaced out on herbal drugs or perhaps suckered by cult fanatics?  <br />*** The book has no final answers.  Its main goal is to detach people from the modern sense of time and the often unhappy pursuits we impose on ourselves and each other.  But the otherworld retreat of Shangri-La isn't perfect either, and it's more interesting to consider the place from the outside than to be stuck in it.	2001-11-16

Her older brother is experiencing a crisis of religious faith, her mother is teetering on mental instability, and her father is oblivious to how unglued his family is becoming.<br />*** Goldberg is a sensitive and eloquent writer.  She gives compassionate consideration to all her characters.  Her most poignant and accessible portrait, however, is really of Eliza.  The power she gains from consonants and vowels becomes a sacred and spiritual journey and a race to save her family from disintegrating.	2001-11-16

Two cousins, Sammy Clay and Joe Kavalier, combine their talents to create a comic book hero they dub &quot;The Escapist.&quot;  The setting of 1940s Manhattan is just the place for these two fresh-faced, boyish men who become overnight successes. <br />*** Despite the likability of the story and the characters, I felt somehow out of step with the pacing of the novel.  Scenes which I wanted to leave sooner were overlong and others would've been more enjoyable had they not been so truncated.<br />*** The evolution of the characters mirrors the overarching vibe of the era.  Joe and Sammy begin as wide-eyed kids full of ideas and spark.  With the war comes an abrupt (and even brutal) end to their innocence.  They are forced to trade in all their verve and precociousness for the mantles of adulthood.  And in the post-war 1950s, they come face to face with the youthful dreams and passions they sacrificed.<br />*** While Chabon's book is clearly nostaligic, it isn't always beautiful and safe.  Ugly things happen even in the most idealized of eras.  But despite the horrible blemishes, there is foundation for the glorious scrappy nature of America that should not be forgotten.  American spunk takes a beating all the time.  Nevertheless, we should be able to go back to our early impulses to do good, to atune the world to our creative forces.	2001-11-16

Chang is a graceful author with just the right touch of sensitivity and insight into the lives of Chinese immigrants in America.  The special talent here is in the individual attention Chang gives to each family, each story.  This is not a social history portrayal of the masses.  While the family structures are seemingly uniform (husband and wife and one or two children) and the range of vocations unsurprising (restaurant workers, music prodigies, math and tech specialists), the characters are more emotionally dimensional than one would suspect.<br />*** The theme of hunger is the dramatic thread running through all the stories -- hunger for personal expression, parental acceptance or love, or independence.  The immigrant experience is a poignant paradox of being closely tied to one's family or home and yet feeling the fierce need to pull away in order to succeed.  The ultimate hunger becomes not one extreme or the other, but in wanting both polar opposites to work at once.  It is an impossible hunger to satisfy and yet continually churning at the core of every character.	2001-11-15

But if you persist, you will be impressed by Nicholas's investigative powers, stunned by the audacity of Nazis, and perversely fascinated by the protective lengths of museums, artists, and ordinary civilians took to save their treasures from falling into enemy hands.  <br />*** The appropriation of great works of art may not be a crime equal to the holocaust of human lives, but we can begin to grasp the progression of tyranny in stolen property and the systematic imposition on everyday lives.  It is a story that doesn't have complete resolution.  Even today, works of art remain missing or await return to their rightful owners.  Many treasures were destroyed, however, and will never return.  It is a haunting echo of other, more heinous war crimes.	2001-11-15

Even at the age of 8, there's no way he could get lost in his own city.  He &quot;loves the statues and monuments.  If Dublin were a woman, he'd marry her.&quot;<br />*** &quot;44 Dublin Made Me&quot; will invariably be compared to Frank McCourt's &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; on the sole count of being Irish.  The Irish, however, are a diverse people, and life in Dublin is very different from life in Limmerick.  McCourt's family faced scraping poverty, whereas Sheridan's family (by no means millionaires) have a steady home environment, food on the table, and the constant presence of both parents raising a large brood.  <br />*** Peter Sheridan focuses on the decade of the 60s which begins with childhood innocence (getting a TV for the first time) and makes his way through adolescence and two defining events in the author's life -- a disturbing encounter on a train at age 13 and later the death of a family member.  <br />*** Sheridan has a wonderful voice for storytelling.  He stays true to his kid spirit and endears without being precious.  And in fine Irish tradition, every laugh has a tragic edge and every sadness is survived by some beauty.	2001-11-15

The oceanside setting of turn-of-the-20th-century New Hampshire is also a seductive environment recalling an era of deep-set traditions being pulled into the subversiveness of the new century.<br />*** As the story opens, our young heroine, Olympia, makes the precarious passage to girlhood to womanhood: &quot;For in the space of time it has taken to walk from the sea-wall to the sea, perhaps a distance of a hundred yards, she has passed from being a girl, with a child's pent-up and nearly frenzied need to sweep away the rooms and cobwebs of her winter, to being a woman.&quot;  <br />*** Olympia exudes a wiser, stronger sense of self than most of us are blessed with even as adults.   Her evolving emotions and experiences are breathtaking.  Shreve makes it absolutely clear that Olympia is not romantically preyed upon.  Her affair with John Haskell, the much older, very married family man, is the convergence of two souls who would've lived accomplished and not-unhappy lives had they not met.  But because they do, they recognize a chance for transcendence.  It's an incredible discovery of love -- one that will jeopardize their futures and the futures of their families.<br />*** The first half of the book is the most captivating, but Shreve quite admirably sees her characters through to the end.  Edith Wharton is a clear influence and with marvelous results.	2001-07-31

Not only did America fight overseas, but it mobilized at home on a scale that seems fantastical to us today.  What we do with modems, email and computers, they did with telegrams, letters, phones, and typewriters.  Forget about cable TV and network news.  The media machine ran on newspapers, radio waves, and newsreels at the movies.  And yet with these relatively low-tech mediums, the Roosevelts mobilized the nation out of the Great Depression and into the mass production of enough munitions and surplus to win the war.  <br />Goodwin is a stirring historian, and the book is truly an achievement.  Though Goodwin's words are effusive, it's not motivated by flag-waving.  Instead, her subjects have a poignant humanity with all its heroic and fallible qualities.  The book is a long one, but if you're investing any time finding out more about the Roosevelts and the American homefront, there's no one better than Doris Kearns Goodwin to hear it from.	2001-06-26

Her personal resolve to be directly useful to the war effort prompts her to leave her job as a secretary and to become an undercover operative for the British in France.<br />However, it's not the secret identities and undercover maneuverings that most convince the reader of Charlotte's heroism.  It's her intense involvement with RAF pilot Peter Gregory who goes missing in action.  Without sentimentalizing, she sees her feelings for Gregory as transcendent and is willing to see it through to the end.  <br />It's a crazy thing to persist in love in the middle of the war and in the midst of being an undercover operative.

The chapters alternate back and forth chronicling one and then the other.

He died when Jeff was only eight and never saw Jeff become the grunge era non-conformist with an uncanny mixture of altar boy and rock star vocals.   <br />****I can't pretend to be a Tim Buckley fan.

But Browne also gives the practical truth -- that Jeff was a passionate soul with mordant and gloomy moods like anyone else but possessing a gift for music that mesmerized his family, friends, and fans.  He wasn't always recognized or easily understood by everyone, but once he came into your radar, you never forgot him.<br />****One big gripe against David Browne and the publishers however -- they failed to include a bibliography of resources (newspaper and magazine articles) or a discography of Jeff's (or Tim's) recordings and others related to him.  Ultra-enthusiastic fans would probably love a timeline of Jeff's performance tours and a listing of those who influenced Jeff musically and mentioned in the main text of the book (Nina Simone, Bob Dylan, the Smiths, the Grifters, Cocteau Twins etc.).	2001-02-27
US	46929841	R2OE9JQZD0JT0	074320395X	785819131	The Body Artist: A Novel	Books	4	2	3	N	N	An epic novella	Don De Lillo has a knack for knockout beginnings.  He wrote one of the best for his last novel, &quot;Underworld,&quot; centering around a legendary baseball game (1951's &quot;Shot Heard Around the World&quot; game).  In &quot;The Body Artist&quot;, the novella begins with a morning spent between a couple -- the body artist Lauren and her husband, Rey Robles, a film director.  The couple converse over orange juice and toast, demonstrating the quirks and cues of language, behavior, and the senses.  De Lillo's scope is not scenically epic, but his writing remains profoundly conceived and displayed.  <br />****Despite the spotlight start, the reader will probably find the rest of the book to be ponderous and even boring.  The next time we see Lauren, she is dealing with the absence of her husband and begins a relationship with a stranger who seems ageless, nameless, and detached from language and meaning.  All the signifiers of taste, color, sight, and sound in the book's opening sequence are unraveled.  Readers looking for plot and pacing will be frustrated. <br />****But if we suppress expectations and just consider De Lillo's mindscape, the novella works.  &quot;The Body Artist&quot; questions how we register the world around us and the people in it.  (What gives their true essence?  Does language have real meaning?)  We can recreate what someone says and even the tone and gestures they use to emphasize their words, but the original person is elusive.  Meaning, therefore, must be personal and illogical to the material and linguistic worlds.  And as De Lillo writes, &quot;You know more surely who you are on a strong bright day after a storm when the smallest falling leaf is stabbed with self-awareness.&quot;  There is no trail leading to that clarity.  And yet, it is the absolute truth.	2001-02-27

Perhaps THE film classic of all time.  Why would such a book be necessary?<br />****The answer relies on three things.  First of all, &quot;Casablanca&quot; is a story that the audience fell into.  A wealth of backstory exists that we only caught glimpses of.  Second, the audience has an innate desire to know that Rick and Ilsa see each other again.  Third, a film sequel is no longer possible with its original players (principally Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains).  The book allows their irreplaceable images to remain intact while giving the characters new things to do.<br />****Walsh is mildly successful in not making a complete travesty of his assignment.  He picks up on hints imbedded in &quot;Casablanca.&quot;  From Rick's comment to the Nazis that there are certain sections of New York they shouldn't try to invade, Walsh rumminates that Richard Blaine was originally Yitzhak Baline, a Jewish gangster and speakeasy manager in New York.<br />****Louis Renault's curiosity and remarks about Rick's past is also useful:  &quot;Did you abscond with the church funds?  Did you run off with the Senator's wife?  I like to think that you killed a man -- it's the romantic in me.&quot;  In the film, Rick replies that it was a combination of all three reasons and Walsh draws on that idea as well.<br />****The down side to this novel involves the characters of Victor Lazlo and Ilsa.  Victor carries on like a self-righteous man blinded by &quot;the cause&quot; and revenge.  Walsh has Ilsa go undercover in an attempt to portray her as more active in the war intrigue and her destiny.  However good the intent, the scenario plays out poorly. <br />****&quot;As Time Goes By&quot; does give food for the imagination -- if only how you would've written a better story.  But you can easily live your life without ever reading Walsh's book.  The best advice, really, is to see &quot;Casablanca&quot; again.  The original never disappoints.	2001-02-27
US	46929841	R16GQE5NZKEUPC	1580630804	285939868	Salinger: A Biography	Books	3	3	3	N	N	General bio with no revelations	Paul Alexander pulls together what seems an accurate timeline of Salinger's life.  Salinger is a legendary recluse and seriously uptight about leaking any personal information.  A biography without his cooperation is inherently non-conclusive and hardly in-depth.  <br />****A basic profile, however, still provides some interest. Alexander documents that Salinger was not a good student in his youth.  His instructors evaluate him as having potential but no genius I.Q. or motivation.  His ambition to write doesn't surface until he is almost in college.  <br />****In World War II, Salinger serves in the Army, participating in D-Day and marching into Paris after Allied liberation.  This is a particularly significant time for Salinger psychologically and in his writing.  It's at this time that he develops &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;.  One can see where Holden's exhaustion, confusion, and melancholy come from.  In large part, it's the war-weary Salinger channeled through.<br />****If Salinger is an autobiographical writer and we consider hints given in the Glass family chronicles like &quot;Seymour: An Intro&quot;, then Salinger is a professor-figure who wants to cross the street whenever inquisitive, eager students approach.  He believes there are no truly interesting questions anyone can ask him -- at least not so imperative as to justify disturbing his reclusivity.  <br />****To be fair, answering all the fans (and fanatics) would be an overwhelming endeavor  -- probably much like the circus that surrounds J.K. Rowling on book tours.  Salinger is, in a sense, a lone Beatle.  There's no confidante to understand what his celebrity is like.  <br />****I'm guessing Salinger was himself a fan of the Calvin and Hobbes comic strip.  It would be rather appropriate since its creator, Bill Waterson, also retreated from the public despite phenomenal success.  And as much as Salinger refuses to publish anymore, you'd like to imagine that he has access to the internet and that he's given some thought (if not contributed) to the anonymous &quot;instant publication&quot; happening on the world wide web.	2001-02-07

People are led to locations where their screams will not be heard.  Drinking establishments are respectable if there hasn't been a knife fight in the past month.<br />****Chandler's detective, Philip Marlowe, is looking for a case that pays.  But the action starts when he's not on assignment.  He follows a stranger into a &quot;Negro dinge joint&quot; for no other compelling reason except that it wasn't any of his business. The dinge joint turns out to be a homicide scene, and Marlowe continues to follow the case without a real client in sight.  Even the police aren't overly-interested in his participation.<br />****He's a smart-mouth.  An almost-heel.  He frequently talks to himself out loud.  Sometimes he hears a voice replying and realizes it's his own.  This guy's a freak.  <br />****It's not hard to imagine how a recent writer like Jonathan Lethem could create a detective who has Tourette's Syndrome in &quot;Motherless Brooklyn&quot; (Vintage Books, 1999).  A detective is really just a man with serious quirks - he's also smarter than you think he is and likable enough to get the girl, at least for a little while.<br />****Marlowe's a special brand of freak.  He notices with exacting detail and describes in kid-like exaggeration what people wear.  He fixates on the body musk of henchmen, the desirability of women, and a pink-headed bug crawling around an office.    <br />****There are &quot;agents&quot; in the universe - men with fluid positions that we merely call private investigators.  Marlowe can fall into a scenario not of his creation. He can be as one character describes, &quot;a late comer to the show,&quot; but just in time to be in on the action. He carries the arc in a story and brings clarity.  If he can't figure things out, there is no solution to be had.<br />****&quot;Farewell, My Lovely&quot; is typical Chandler - tough, sardonic, thickly sliced but smartly dialogued, and oddly, funny as hell.	2001-02-07
US	46929841	RIC5GDA850BN	0385720114	977875409	The Map of Love: A Novel	Books	3	3	5	N	N	Three and a half stars	An Egyptian woman, Amal, and an American journalist named Isabel discover a shared family past which began almost a century ago with the marriage of Anna Winterbourne and Sharif Pasha al-Baroudi in turn of the 20th century Cairo.  <br />****This premise is intelligently explored through Anna's journal entries and letters, and in Amal's gift for filling in where those primary sources are silent.  The author herself is adept at painting Egypt's conflicted political and social identities in the 1900s, and their repercussions almost a century later.<br />****The central love story between Anna and Sharif Basha is given romantic but dignified attention.  This is not a bodice-ripping epic.  Echoes of their romance are played out in Isabel's relationship with Amal's brother, Omar, a charismatic but much-older musician living in New York City.<br />****&quot;The Map of Love&quot; is a thoughtful story with a strong sense of beauty and language.  It's also a Booker Prize finalist and shares a structural complexity similar to 1992's &quot;The English Patient &quot; by Michael Ondaatje (which did receive the Booker Prize).  Unlike the latter however, &quot;The Map of Love&quot; would translate as a decent TV miniseries rather than as a celebrated feature film.	2001-02-07

Confidential	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Hollywood crime story seethes with emotion &amp; violence	For anyone who's seen the film with Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pearce, you know &quot;L.A. Confidential&quot; is a gritty crime story set in 1950s Hollywood.  The original novel by James Ellroy, however, is even darker, more crime-ridden, more intricate, and full of raw emotion.  The Los Angeles police department fights crime and is itself a primary instigator of corruption and bloodshed.<br />****The story reads like a fierce animal fed by the author's own demons and the real life tragedy of his mother's brutal murder when Ellroy was only a boy.  Ellroy gives this horrifying past to one of the novel's three main characters, Bud White.  White is so soul-ravaged by the memory of his mother that he becomes obsessed with protecting women and terrorizing their abusers.  For all the good that he does, White is tainted by his own seething violence and arrogance.  Ellroy draws him as a conflicted and controversial man.  The same is true for the other principal characters, celebrity-slick Jack Vincennes and golden boy Ed Exley, a war-hero with ruthless ambition.<br />****White, Vincennes, and Exley each investigate the Nite Owl Cafe homicide case which leads to an even bigger monster in the murky depths of drugs, pornography, and prostitution.  The characters, Ellroy, and the reader emerge at the end only by the miracle of human intractability.  It's an exhaustive journey but fully dimensional and hard to shake.	2001-02-07

A pageant of life passes before the sleuth and the audience in dubious sounds, sights, and motives.  Anyone who loved the oddball humor and pathos of the NBC drama &quot;Homicide&quot; will definitely feel at home in this tale of Lionel Essrog, a detective with Tourette's syndrome on the trail of a murderer.There's a gimmicky Raymond Chandler language at play in the novel.  Detectives are referred to as the Minna Men, &quot;tugging the boat&quot; is pushing your luck, and &quot;telling your story walking&quot; is the preferred method of succinctly putting words to work.Dostoevsky's Idiot also resonates throughout the novel.  The ridiculed simpleton is drawn into a world that deems him a lightweight .  Nevertheless, he gains access and becomes the figure who knows the score better than its original players.Lethem's writing is crazy-grin-and-laugh-out-loud funny, unsentimentally poignant, and hugely rewarding.  He gets maximum effect out of his central character, and there's nothing lost in the translation of Tourette's syndrome to the reader.	2000-12-08

It's still interesting to see what the home front had to make do with.In &quot;Eating for Victory&quot;, baking gets the political treatment as a point of women's rights and also as propaganda by the government and media to keep women in traditional roles.  The skillful, well-dressed homemaker associated most often with 1950s TV moms like June Cleaver is really the Wartime Homemaker.As a reader, one's context of time needs re-adjustment.  It used to be the Basic Seven, not the Four Food Groups.  People didn't know eating habits could lead to heart disease, and dieting was not in the national mania for women.Perhaps the biggest time warp is understanding the uproar over African American women leaving domestic &quot;Mammy&quot; jobs in affluent homes for higher paying war work.  Fathoming that old-world structure of educated women feeling &quot;put-out&quot; and oblivious or resentful of the cultural liberation going on -- it's a real step back in time and mores.  (Imagine if Rene on the current TV show &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; were the live-in maid and not Ally's best-friend /roommate / fellow-lawyer.)  Amy Bentley's style doesn't escape the scholarly soundbites and droning hum of dissertations.  There's enough homey details, however, to make it tolerable.  And clearly, Bentley's given her subject careful thought and personal investment.  Not every woman was Rosie the Riveter or a Pin-up Girl, but every Rosie and Pin-up was a Wartime Homemaker to some degree.  Bentley's book is one of the few to recognize this and to give it due credit.	2000-12-04
US	46929841	R29SY5CYDFQWZ5	0520215656	946087098	To Place Our Deeds: The African American Community in Richmond, California, 1910-1963	Books	4	8	9	N	N	A well-researched and insightfully written gem	Richmond, California became a World War II boomtown.  And almost as quickly as it burst at the seams with shipyard productivity, population surges, and overflowing housing, schools, and day care needs, the boomtown deflated.  To a San Francisco-centric mindset, Richmond is no more than a sprawling urban ghetto.  But it's a community that deserves more than quick dismissal.  As Shirley Ann Wilson Moore writes, &quot;This book examines the history of the African American community in Richmond during the critical transitional years of the first half of the twentieth century.  It places the activities of black working-class men and women, regarded by some as unlettered peasants who were spatially and intellectually isolated from larger social currents, at the center of the nation's most profound, transformative events.&quot;Published dissertations generally have an awful density about them -- a frustrating compression of stats, dates, and repetitious topic statements.  Moore's book is somehow magically void of this while maintaining its scholarly value and dignity.  Richly supported by oral histories, the book is unique for telling a community story of California, the American WW2 home front, and the African American experience all at once.Moore's work is an insightful and appropriately succinct package encompassing the exodus of thousands of African Americans from the Jim Crow south to establishment of community, church life, self-sufficiency, war work, blues clubs, prosperity and stability in Richmond -- if not for all, at least for some instead of none.  These Richmondites were urban pioneers who laid the basis for the Civil Rights Movement in following generations.	2000-12-04
