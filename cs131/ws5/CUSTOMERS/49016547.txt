I thought that this book would cover africa's role In the bible while discussing eurocentrism and afrocentrism.It turn's out that It Is  mainly a criticism of afrocentrism.If one has a probelm with afrocentrism then we have to go back to the first lie which started with eurocentrism and go from there.I would have liked to read more about african and bible history, and If was going to be criticism's(afrocentrism and eurocentrism) then let them be discussed equal.This notion about race Is a modern thing and did not exist among the ancient's.People at that time were more concerned about nation.It was decided long after that(In modern times) certain groups belonged to this race and to that race to justify racism.If It were possible to go back In a time machine many people would be shocked at what they see.The people In history- Cleopatra, Moses, Ramses,Hannibal,Jesus looked nothing like the Images we have become use to seeing of them.Let's face It, the Images In movies and pictures are wrong,wrong,wrong.We can only move foward when look at history objectively as It was,and without our modern bias.	2004-06-12

The Ideal of a race of super gods Imparting wisdom on mankind Is a Interesting theory and on that I would reconmend this book.The thing that bothers me Is his theory on what happens when we die.You see,I believe that pain and joy Is a part of this life,but hell In this world Is caused by what man does to oneanother not god.If we are bought back then why erase our memories of our past life since this Is what will help us on our journey toward perfection.We learn from our experiences and If In one life we suffer and gain compassion and In the next life we become 'better off' without memory of the last life,what Is to keep us from falling back Into the same state that we have risen from?God dosen't send us through hell and heaven,we send each other through It.If man does not learn how to treat his brother/sister better and learn to share(which Is what true message of hope should be)the coming destruction will be caused by his own hands.	2002-12-29

This Is great reading and I don't see why anyone should be offended by It.The ancient egyptians were different physical types as africans are today but they were'black'(not europeans).Any book that has positive contributions of blacks to civilization Is going to come under heavy criticism.This book Is not afrocentric but because the author preposes something other than blond blue eyed or dark skinned whites (don't make me laugh!) this Is racist anti white book!please! stop the maddness.The egyptians were an african people who were probaly mixed at times.I beleive that ancient people had a lot more technogy than they are given credit for and I think the author Is correct In his theories on egyptians exploring europe.Anyway,a good book that should not be missed.	2002-10-24

This Is a very Interesting book which I was able to read within 3 days.I was so glued to It that I could not put It down.The author really has a grasp on the political situation In jesus' day.The book reads like a novel and Is exciting throughout.He preposes that jesus was born of a earthtly father but whether or not that It was Joseph, we cannot know.Also so he says the torture and beating Jesus received saved him from 'death' and was the real reason behind the resurrection.After reading this you will really see jesus In a whole different light.But, there Is one downpoint for me though, and It the portrayal of jesus as blond haired and blue eyed.The author presents these old pictures and seems to say &quot;this Is how jesus actually looked&quot;.It cheapens It a bit for me, as science has proven the real jesus was dark semitic man as all jews of that time were.Even with that flaw It Is still a book that should not be missed.	2002-10-24

This Is a great book but I can not believe In It's overall conculsion.It says we are In hell, which may be true but the choices we are given are beyond reach even for the most enlightend man.He states that the body Is a block to spirital freedom.That I believe but that also means that no man can be perfect but that he can work toward It.The only way one can be perfect In that way Is to leave His or Her body which would be death.Also the author claims that our next life will be worse or better depending on our chracter In this life.If we suffer we grow and in the next life we will be better off materially but, this existance may make us lack compassion so, In our next life we suffer again since we have no memory of our last life.His theory Is that thorough suffing are spirits grow.Now this Is right on but two things are wrong with It:The only way we can grow through suffing Is to learn from It and If we have no memory It can not help us at all.:Also without justice suffering Is no good because,there has to be hope for one to grow also.Compassion comes from suffering but also knowledge that god will make(maybe not when we wish)all things right.Suffering cannot grow one without justice just as compassion can not come without suffering	2002-06-27

This is a great book.It deals the fear of what he calls, the agency of africans(The ability of africans to create society,community, culture and civilization.)Why does the critics have such a fear of this? Because most of them want to keep alive a myth that has been told for years.He deals with the fact most historians like to take egypt out of africa and place it in the near east In fact, a lot of very good books I have read on the bible and the ancient near east have done just that.There Is also a fear of the fact that Egypt had a very powerful influence on greek culture.I have read many books that try to refute this fact, but not one of them have produced a reasonable argument but have instead show true racist fears.A lot of people(By this I mean educated people) will know the truth, but will tell a lie because It is expediant to do so.The ancient greeks also said the egyptains were black now, how can you, who were not there, change that ? There Is nothing to fear of truth In fact, It will bring all people (regardless of their race) together.The time Is at hand for the truth that will place all races and culture in their proper place.This book Is one of those platforms by which this will be accomphished.Buy It!
