At its core is a poetic quest for  language and vision, a text written and formed in &quot;the visionary  company of love&quot; which would include Rimbaud, Whitman, F Scott  Fitzgerald, and Henri Michaux.  The &quot;labyrinth&quot; the self is  entangled in is the excess of wealth and business nexus, the solipsism of  sexual need and self-consciousness, the social determinations of class and  culture that are never fully voided. But the mentor figures in the book  are, oddly enough, James Merrill as delicate social force and trainer of  agape, and Nancy Ling Perry as the militant apocalypse of drugs,  revolutionary ideology, rage, bliss, and death.  Somewhere between these  two voices, lost in the heights of Tibet and clarity of meditative  consciosness and restraint, Robin Magowan finds a new self and reveals much  about the American capitalist self in the process.  This is a wondrous book  caputuring the 1960s at its visionary and crazy core, and moving out of the  conformist 1950s into something better.  It is a poetic quest worthy of a  great soul, written with courage, lucidity, and need.  A drunken boat  casting its waves from Merrill Lynch to Dante and ordinary selfhood. A  prayer of &quot;crack up&quot; like Fitzgerald's uttered in the  micro-cracks, woundings, and megatrends of capital gone inward into  self-abolishment and the quest for vision.	2000-08-16

A counter-history and  counter-memory to US state is mapped and plotted:<br />The poems are situated  and mongrel in fine ways, the critiques are full of insights and historical  contexts.

Deft moments of  religiosity and self dismantlement (not to mention the disfigurement of  traditions and neighborhoods and traditions) figure in via a wry calculus  of gain and loss, feeling and abandonment. He has much to reveal on writing  and thinking in &quot;the space of city trees,&quot; meaning Singapore and  what is left to the poetic spirit.  This book is a gift and prayer, from a  poet and painter of stellar imagination, quiet intelligence, and abandoned  wry wit.

It is unusual in the range and diversity of writers and genres, but there is much to value here,  especially from the lesser known postcolonial English sites of Singapore  (Arthur Yap), Malaysia and US (Shirley Lim), Indonesia, with modernist  grandees like Sartre, Tony Morrison (why her?), the ever-boring Vikram Seth  and radiantly nasty VS Naipaul thrown in for critical measure. <br />In  effect, SKOOB Pacifica is quietly creating an array of literary anthologies  and individual texts that matter:  my only hope is that they would  circulate more fully in the American, Pacific, and Asian/American markets  where they could be appreciated and challenged with critique and respect  and so on.

This is a superb, well-crafted, and capacius collection of the post-Ashbery US poetics which pervades the very climate of Americanist thinking about poetic subjectivity, language, identity, the trauma of  broken narcissism, the promise of the sublime after Wallace Stevens and  Andre Breton and so on.  <br />The range of poets who consider themselves in  what she calls &quot;the tribe of John&quot; is quite amazing in itself,  what you might congregate as &quot;the other tradition&quot; of  dis-Americanizing, wild, and risk-taking poetics from Bernstein to Creeley,  Walter Lew, and John Yau et al.  Saludos, Susan, for your care and  transnational vision of the future.

What Wlliam Spanos offers here, with relentless clarity, energy, wry wit, and range of intellectual and social-political insights, is an ontological critque of Empire.  Thes crowing study is devastating and elegant, worthy  of Melville and those prior US cultural workers who had opposed (and failed  to disrupt) the US historical and geographical project of sublimated  imperialism.  Spanos, to me, is a Charles Olson in his range of visions and  caustic style, and I just wish his work would gather the readers it  deserves.

Once, in the environs of Wheeler Hall in the mid 80s, I was talking to Robert Pinksy about this-and-that poetics, and I was ranting in hyperbolic style about Bob Dylan being a kind of Blake for our time, refiguring  &quot;Jesus the Imagination&quot; in a time of imperial blight and so on.  Pinsky looked at me wryly, a bit baffled, and said, &quot;Dylan is somebody  I never got into.  I never really thought of him as a poet.&quot;  I was  amazed by this comment, and begin to wonder (as I often do) if I knew what  poetry is anymore.  But I never lost my amazement towards B Dylan, and his  latest Nietzschean attack on his own deepest belief structures and pieties  in &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; and &quot;Things Have Changed&quot; from  &quot;Wonderboys&quot; soundtrack only confirms the scope, depth, and  generic visionary quality of his work.

Meaghan Morris, early and late, writes cultural criticism at its global/local,wry perverse best.  Lest this sound too late-capitalist cynical or rude, I should say that she writes from and as the local and  national site of Australia, making this political and libidinal space of  transnational cultural studies resonate with the most urgent, critical, and  international issues that trouble our politics and poetics. <br />As such, she  reinvents Asia/Pacific as she writes, showing us (or should I say the  writerly obsessive &quot;me&quot;) how to work and affiliate in a space of  writing and moral-political concern.  When I read her essays, I face the  panic white sublimity of awe and admiration, clotted and displaced.  She  invents topics and tropes for each essay or book, reframing tourism, mass  media, film, movement, embodied location, identity, without falling into  the &quot;banality of cultural studies&quot; or the throwaway language and  motel spaces that haunt our politics.  <br />She is an untimely critic, whose  writing is both too soon and too late for the market.

The wry chapter on the Hollywood movies of &quot;safe  savagery&quot; makes an important and lasting contribution to the semiotics  of imagining Hawai'i.

It would be a very useful collection to use in a college  course on poetics, or to ponder in your deformations of lyric selfhood and  US utterance.  Christopher Beach knows his materials well, and the choices  he makes are quite deft and innovative in a quiet intelligent way.  Perhaps  a bit more global/local warping away from the US &quot;mainstream&quot; of  innovation would have made the text more multicultural and plural.

Like Henry Adams, Lu is caught  between one world dying and another world being born, and she is the cyborg  maker of this mongrel syntax, part novel, part autobiography, cool,  lyrical, perverse.  It is a work of great abstraction and reverse  specificity, creating the ethnoscape of silicon valley selfhood in a way  that alters reading habits and creates the retro-fitted syntax of  postmodern post-fordist subjectivity.

This is a brave, elegant, and timely book cognizant of  global/local dialectics that are now pulling at the nation state and  unravelling the paradoxes of liberal humanism.  No  &quot;monarch-of-all-I-survey,&quot; Bruce Robbins yet hazards a wry  perspective of cosmopolitan globailty and, chapter by chapter, articulates  the paradoexes of feeling global yet remaining national in struggles and  claims.  The readings of English Patient, Kincaid, and the au pair  postcolonial post-Bronte novels are worth the price of any cultural studies  and hyper-literary admission.  The chapters on his father's aerial military  work in US army situate the claims of globalized vision within an ethical  and political frame that has scale, balance, pungency, and wit.  This is a  fine addition to the cultural criticism of globalization, without the  arrgonace or aridity of social science sway: NYU Press can be applauded for  its &quot;Cultural Front&quot; series, and this suavely wrought  synthesis  of feeling global and national, being cosmopolitan yet entangled in  American dirty roots.	2000-01-29

Readings of films, novels, sociological  studies, journalistic tracts and images that expose the inclusion/exclusion  of Asian Americans as inside (&quot;introjected&quot; as model minority)  and outside (&quot;projected&quot; as alien and foreign) the core American  national identity are finely and relentlessly situtated within the terrains  of a shifting global economy which calls upon racialization phobias (yellow  peril discourse) and assimilation myths (model minority stories)to  include/exclude Asians to fit US trans/national needs.  Brilliantly  nuanced, demanding, and politically adjudicated readings of US cultural  works-- like The Bitter Tea of General Yen, Flower Drum Song, Native  Speaker, Time and New Republic covers, Asiagate-- are enriched and  contextualized by counter-readings of transnationalizing urban spaces from  Monterey Park to Western Addition to expose and complicate the imbrications  of Asia within America: as economy, as phobic excess, as cultural flow, as  political ally, as geopolitical/civilizational antagonist.  To my mind,  this is one of the most important studies I know of the Pacific Ocean space  and Asia Pacific imaginary as a racialized &quot;frontier,&quot; liminal  zone of innovation, and trans/national destiny that deeply implicates the  US in patterns of exclusion and inclusion and war and peace demanding our  fully historicized attention.  David Palumbo-Liu's work offers tools of  cultural studies and political-economic care that are exemplary in their  range, reach, and general decency in responding to the duplex  Asian/American culture.  While the categories of time, space, psyche, and  body are huge and meandering, the field of American Studies as such is  complicated and enriched in its &quot;field imaginary&quot; by this valued,  nuanced, probing, and fully situated contribution. The &quot;seam&quot; of  Asian and American, as bind and divide, is offered a cultural poetics  worthy of the racial problematic and the complicated history of US  modernity.	1999-06-22

Joseph Puna Balaz is a vital and important Hawaiian poet, then (1970s) as now (1990s), so anything he writes is of interest. This book is his early poetry, and sets the stage for the later, more indigenized and mongrel  works.

A memoir of Maxine Hong Kingston's memorable years in Hawai'i, when she went from Viet Nam protests and virtual street existence to pedagogies and mythologies of empowerment that took on national and global impact. This, I  find, an insightful, wry, even caustic book on the local literature  movements in Hawai'i, always fresh and insightful even when New Yorkerish.	1999-05-20

Japonisme, the vague contact with an oriental tradition of other love and other bliss, finds a new outlet here, bravely and meanderingly so.  The book has a handsome cover as is true of Sun &amp; Moon books where design  often overrides the slightness of manifest content and irrelevance of  politics:  here, the collection of fragments has an atmosphere of vague  longing and urbane lovelornness about it.  One feels the high tradition of  the great Lady Murasaki is being sifted through the intense lens of  American solipsism, and the fit is selfindulgent, poised, posed, and  unnerving.  At least this author is moving out beyond the landscape of the  self, is seeking to get beyond the babble of love bliss and self-therapy.   A mixed offing, but suggesting more to come.  This is not so much 'Japan  bashing' as it is Japan blessing of courtly love.  If the whole world now  belongs to globalizing Americans, say, we might as well have some lyric fun  shopping over the traditions and the advanced poetic goods! Let them eat  sushi.	1999-05-20

Immigrant Acts performs its own multiple acts of immigration, assimilation, suablternization in sophisticated and probing ways that would unite a Gramscian problematic of class and place with a more professional  concern with identity politics in ethnic studies and Asian American  racialization patterns.  While I might want to argue with the will to  theorize and include diverse forms of decolonization and resistance that do  not fit this racial calculus of abjected othering, still, this book is an  indispensable text of US identity politics in this era of maximal  globalization and localization for the Pax Americana.  The chapter on  beloved T. Cha remains incredibly good, the historicized reminder of  immigrant acts of rejection directed against the Chinese then and Mexicans  and Vietnamese now haunts any easy vision of US liberal tolerance and  multicultural peace.  I need this book, Mr. President, even when I hate it  and love it and get locked into its hyper-textual terms (one sign of  textual power, that, the displacement of the reader).  I am no immigrant  act myself, just a Scottish Italian half-poet,but am working overtime out  here in Asia/Pacific waters off the coast of California and Taiwan and need  to study the main moves. My praise is superfluous at this point, and the  indigenous struggles go on far from the immigrant acts of assimilation  textual resistance.  The US nation wobbles, not a bit.	1999-05-19

Ono Ono Girl's Hula ia a &quot;loco moc&quot; brew of mongrel identity politics, more or less, emanating as much from the grounds of cultural political struggle in contemporary Hawai'i as much as from the verbal flux  of the diasporic Pacific Rim and the ethnic opportunism of California.  I  like it a lot, at times crazed and infuriated as I read the schizo-text of  herstory; Carolyn Lau (who was a great Chinese poet in days past) is not  Haunani Kay Trask and moments in the text when she aspires towards  primordial ideological bullying are way off the mark.  But when she lets  the language flow and mix, she becomes one shameless hussy of mongrel  postcolonialty, and it is worth it, dear reader, to go along for the poetic  and sexual ride into the ono ono girl's blissy blessed hula.	1999-05-17

This is a useful book, full of scope and sway, but marred in my reading by being written (too uncritically) from within the techno-euphoria and liberal pieties of American Studies confirming what is so exceptional and  blessed about being American.  As such, it is a book more about American  pastoral (a la Leo Marx) than about the traumas and will to imperial and  global domination of the sublime but David Nye is too much of a devoted  Marxian and Americanist to realize this is so.  Anyway, read it and be  amazed a la Whitman or Kerouac, dear reader, at the Broadway lights and the  Hoover Dam!	1999-05-14

I especially like his wry take on Singapore as a homey  mall (his first home), and on his trip through the whitey south on a  shoestring poet's budget. Justin Chin is a legend in Hawai'i, where I write  and teach, and now I see why; and he should send Morgan Blair an inscribed  copy of his book so she (one of his teachers)can see that he remembers her  amid the postmodern muck of it all.	1999-05-13

Texts function not just as literary icons but as material transactions and  installations of power.  While detailed in thick cultural ways, this  innovative approach to textuality has larger implications for the China  study field (where it will be taken by some as a threat to their own  textual power at Chicago and Columbia etc.), as well as for the broader  field of cultural studies where the &quot;empire of the text&quot; is still  confined to the pop cultural text as such.  This is the first of many books  from an innovative scholar who denies himself the lesser comforts and  pieties of the &quot;Chinese field imaginary.&quot; Go for it.	1999-05-13

I find these mixed-genre essays to be stimulating,energizing, dismantling, inventive,  taking the grounds of &quot;a poetics&quot; into a newfoundland of play,  risk, and stylistic mixture. By this, I mean that the prior senses of voice  and forms of genre, not to mention the stabilities of &quot;poetic  diction,&quot; are taken into stranger post-ego areas of language risk,  secular conversion, and fun.  Sinatra did it &quot;my way,&quot; and  Charles Bernstein (like a zanier Bob Dylan watching a Marx Brothers movie  while reading Deleuze and composing the Greenwich Village Joe Hill Blues on  a used mouth harp) did it his, and &quot;official verse culture&quot; in  the United States will never be the smug same old poesy again. Not for  those whose version of pastoral is still made of petunia flowers, tylanol,  and sheep.	1999-05-11

To keep going as a writer over the years, at least in the minor and non-commercial genre of American poetry, you have to tell yourself some version of Mark Twain's trans-Atlantic cable:  \\"The reports of my death [as  a poet] have been greatly exaggerated.\\"  Robin Magowan is an American  surrealist poet of genuine imagination and linguistic risks who has kept  writing over the years with a consistency of tactic and concern that might  be called obsessional, wish-drenched fantasy from one point of view and the  signature of an authentic style from another. <br /> A special  listening is at the core of this poetics of the syllable and the  transcendental image.  For \\"God still moves in the sound of the long `o,'  as Dylan Thomas once suggested; and although a half-century of  deconstructive semiotics (and worse) have taught us to be much more  cautious about such enthusiasms for the logos and the mystique of verbal  and religious presence, such assumptions and risks of intuitive language  and the inscape of imagery are at the core of  Robin Magowan's poetry.  <br />  Magowan's Lilac Cigarette in a Wish Cathedral, as its wonderful title for  this project suggests, registers a poetry of risk-fulfillment, tracking  extremities and delicacies of sense and wish, mountain journeys, desert  flights, movements into and out of the primacy of ecstatic fulfillment that  haunts the Greco-Roman tradition as this comes down to the United States  via a \\"whit manic\\" incarnation that haunts our little streets and huge  continental hungers.  He works this through the Emersonian sense of  abandonment and solitary quest, which seeks \\"ravishment of the intellect by  coming nearer to the fact\\" of self-loss and the desacralization that is the  fate of commodity culture.<br /> This is a singular collection, suggesting  a life-long discipline in the poetic image and the path of heightened  language, a highly wrought and prolonged \\"derangement of the senses\\" a la  Rimbaud that has taken Magowanfrom Greece to Tibet and back it its  quest.<br /> The last poem in Lilac Cigarette in a Wish Cathedral  (wherein, as Richard Howard aptly puts it in his trenchant introduction,  \\"the hierophant smokes his lilac cigarette in a wish cathedral\\" that is  each poem) is entitled \\"O,\\" and moves from the crooning and screeching plea  of a Whitmanic voice, \\"O my rooster's urge/ to spring voice loud\\" to the  cranked-up ecstasy (bleeding sound into picture) of \\"dawn flushed/ crimson  screaming o.\\"  <br /> Pain and pleasure as elsewhere bleed into the mix,  the poet lost into the rooster's urge to give rebirth to the whole mounting  and morning landscape.  In \\"Miniature,\\" this transmutation of local scene  into the mystique of poetic/ religious presence is effected not so much  through the visual as through impactions of the aural, what Hopkins called  the \\"inscape\\" of leaping vowels:  \\"The pleasure of sounds innocently  grasped/  A peacock in the eyes of the rain.\\" This twisted and torqued  little haiku of a poem depends on the \\"e\\" becoming \\"I\\" becoming \\"a\\" as much  as upon the image transformation.  The poem enacts, in \\"miniature,\\" the mix  of hearing and sounding that becomes the aesthetic medium of the \\"wish  cathedral.\\"<br /> In a time still dominated by the locality of image (as  in Williams) and the play of skeptical wit (Stevens, and his heirs like  Ashbery), Magowan had always pursued something else, something closer to  Breton or Michaux and the sources of magical incarnations in European  surrealism as a kind of interior Orphic line.  Magowan's book thus opens in  Greece, and seeks the ecstasy of dance and music as tactic of self-loss.   Later, \\"Orfeo\\" courts this lineage, where the poet (ancient to modern)  descends to mount, \\"goes in a gorge/ Of pluming, spraying song.\\"  No gods  or muse arises to help the sense of abandonment and self-loss amid the  murmuring of deadly presence, \\"just a wingbeat to guide/ Murmurous wasp  center, alone.\\"	1999-05-10
