US	53035335	RHK889GVJTOHF	1841956252	523968789	Tamburlaine Must Die	Books	2	3	5	N	N	A brief and weak book	This novella does successfully capture the flavor of the times, but it ultimately cannot decide what it wants to be -- a mystery?  a pseudo-memoir?  an exploration of the last days of a man who suspects his time is up?   <br /> <br />It makes an attempt at all of these, but doesn't succeed in any of them.  For a short piece of fiction, the writing needs to be absolutely concrete with nothing extraneous, but there are scenes (such as an episode with Dr. John Dee) that, while interesting, do nothing to move the story forward - and there are a couple of soft porn sex scenes that are not only unnecessary, but so poorly written as to be almost comical, which certainly breaks the flow of the story.	2005-03-25

Some of these pieces have \\"a message\\" and Sedaris makes them very obvious -- and the spectre of self-importance is looming (a few times, instead of just saying \\"I was in a particular city...\\", he finds it necessary to make the unnecessary point that he is in a particular location to give a lecture, which, as it has nothing to do with the story most of the time, seems to be added just to try to impress us).  Not a good sign, if it continues.<br />But the book is enjoyable, although not as much as his previous works.	2004-06-15

Nowhere does Cornwell make the necessary connection of: because Sickert wrote this specific letter, he must have been the killer because it contains information only the killer would have known.<br />The information on the Ripper murders were, to say the least, widely reported in the popular press -- and Sickert, along with countless others, could have written fake letters \\"from\\" the Ripper based on the information in the newspapers.<br />Much of her research is sketchy, at best (I wouldn't trust myself to know information about private medical procedures done on any of my uncles while they were young boys -- but Cornwell laughably takes the word of Sickert's nephew as absolute -- and the same nephew later retracted what he had said about Sickert's \\"penile\\" fistula, so Cornwell's entire \\"motive\\" is toppled.)<br />Fortunately for Cornwell, nobody can 100% state that Sickert was not the Ripper, but she definitely does not even remotely prove her case.	2002-12-16

No 18-year-old who had read about serial killers is that naive. He  carefully crafted the personas he presented to these serial killers and  heavily researched each of them.  To be then &quot;repulsed&quot;  &quot;surprised&quot; and &quot;furious&quot; when they react to him as he  set them up to, is dishonest.  He intentionally presented himself to Gacy  exactly like one of Gacy's victims.  When Gacy then responds to him in  kind, Mr. Moss is falsely outraged.<br />Although Mr. Moss was an  18-year-old who admittedly got in over his head, he spent great pains to  research what he was doing.  Unlike the &quot;victim&quot; he claims to be,  he was much more like the serial killers -- he planned his actions  methodically, wanted (and got) a specific kind of response, and knew what  he was doing.<br />To call himself a &quot;victim&quot; and equate himself  with those who were killed and unknowingly walked into a spider's web is an  inhumane slap in the face to the victims and their families.	2000-05-27

A narrative about  a dual murder in San Francisco's Mission district is awkwardly interrupted  by a retelling of the Ripper murders and an over-long tale of two warring  newspapers in the early years of The City.  Had he focussed on just one of  these stories, instead of trying to merge them into one book, the flow  would have been greatly improved and each resulting separate book would  have been much stronger.	1999-06-25
