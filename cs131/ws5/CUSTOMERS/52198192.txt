For almost half a year I read Frank Herbert's six DUNE books. When I started out with DUNE, I only read it because I loved the David Lynch movie. But I was hooked. <br />Now, it's all over. No more DUNE for poor me. Oh sure, there's the Brian Herbert &amp; Kevin J. Anderson DUNE books, but they're nothing compared to the brilliance of Frank Herbert. Don't get me wrong, they're good in their own respect, but they lack the depth &amp; meaning that the original six had.<br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this novel, as one of my favorite DUNE characters Miles Teg had been killed, and Dune itself destroyed. <br />But thankfully, Frank Herbert's magic is readily apparent. Not only do you get to read an incredible story, but you get to amass a wealth of knowledge about humanity that no Humanities class could ever teach.<br />I would've loved so much to find out more about those people Duncan see in his visions, but I probably never will. It's too bad, that would've made a great book.<br />Many people have talked about how unfinished the DUNE legacy is because Frank Herbert died before he could write another book, but I think it better this way.<br />Frank Herbert's imagination gave us the DUNE universe, and by not finishing it, I think he gave us a doorway into that universe, to interpet as we see fit. We can use our own imagination to finish what Frank Herbert started, and that's perhaps the greatest gift Frank Herbert could ever give.	2001-03-10

I cannot thank Mr. Foley enough for giving the world this piece of literature. I bought a couple weeks after it came out, and I just keep reading and reading it.  If I was on a desert island, and I had this book,  I'd be happy.  The only problem with this book is that because it became so  popular, now other wrestlers that we really don't care about and who aren't  nearly as interesting as Mick Foley are writing autobiographies.  I mean,  who wants to have the DDP autobiography on their conscience? I sure don't.  But despite that, Mick Foley, thank you very much. You've done the world a  favor.	2000-07-03

I liked how Picard was potrayed, and how  desparate Starfleet can get. The one thing I didn't like, however, was the  fact that Janeway was an admiral. What did she do, besides lose her ship  and break the Prime Directive over and over again? <br />I can understand  Seven of Nine being one because of what she's done for the Federation, but  Janeway? She isn't even a good captain.<br />Anywayz, I recommend this book to  anyone who likes a good read. All you DS9ers out there, even though it has  Janeway, the EMH, and Seven of Nine, it's still a good book. <br />So go out  and buy it .........................	2000-05-25

I'm a 16 year old guy, and I love to read. I got interested in the DUNE books after I rented and watched DUNE. The movie was awesome, and I picked up DUNE and started reading it. I had no intention of reading the whole six  books, but after the first one I was captivated.    I finished  Chapterhouse: DUNE and was actually sad. After almost a year of reading, it  was over. No more DUNE. I almost cried.    I had read House Atreides  between Heretics and Chapterhouse, and was disappointed.   While it was fun  to read and go back and visit my favorite characters, except for Teg, of  course, who wasn't around then. But it lacked the inner meaning. It didn't  grab me and not let go until it had killed me. It was just a book. It  didn't have that depth of meaning I had come to expect, and when I was  through, I didn't think that I had just gone through an incredible  experience that helped me look at humankind in a different light.    But  still, it is DUNE, however misguided. If anybody should continue the DUNE  legacy, it is Frank Herbert's son. I just wish he had done a better job.	2000-02-18

It's a sad day in Star Trek when one of the two best Star Trek tv shows ends(the other best show being TOS of course). And of course, we couldn't have done it any better than the Great Screw-Up of the Galaxy...Rick  Berman!   I couldn't believe how little coverage DS9 got when it ended.  Sure, it got some, but after it ended, poof, it's gone! Now, I'm sure when  Lost In Space II(for those who don't know, I'm referring to Voyager!)ends  there will be talk about it for years.   Anyway, this book is  excellent(especially since it wasn't written by the god-awful Daffyd ab  Hugh!!!). The only scenes I didn't like were the Kira-Crazy scene(but that  was made excellent with the Garak and Damar chit-chat), and the Bashir  &amp; Garak goodbye. I loved what Garak said, and the whole way he acted  during the scene, but then again this ending was good also.   Once again,  Diane Carey proves she is one of the best Trek writers. The space battles  are awesome, the character writing is fabulous. It's...it's amazing!!!    Before I end, I'd like to say thank you to the First Great Bird of the  Galaxy = Gene Rodenberry, and also I'd especially like to thank the Second  Great Bird of the Galaxy = Ira Steven Behr, for making DS9 what it was.	1999-07-30

I wasn't really expecting this book to be good. Was I wrong!!! The only problems I have with this book are Major Kira's coldness to Quark, which was blown way out of proportions, and the way the crew treated Quark and  looked down on him was a bit exaggerated.   A slow beginning, yes, but it  really starts to pick up after that.    I absolutely LOVE the Colonel Mitra  character. I really wish he would appear again in some form or another.    After reading the disappointing Rebels Trilogy(I shouldn't really be  disappointed by it, since it was written by Daffyd ab Hugh, someone who  should never be allowed to even THINK of writing a book!!!), the 34th Rule  is a must-read.	1999-04-18

After reading the pathetic Vengeance by Dafydd ab Hugh, I hated to buy this book, but since I'm a collector, I had to.  The best part throughout the whole book is when we see Kai Winn's past. The rest sucks. Dafydd still  thinks that Starfleet's ranking system is set up like the US Navy's, which  it is not. He has no idea the setup of the Defiant, and there are some many  little errors in the book I wanted to burn it so bad.  The only reason I  gave it 1 star is because I couldn't give it zero.

This book is far worse than the first one, in that Rogue Squadron captures the Imperial Homeworld.   I mean, they're fighter pilots, not commandos. And again, Corran helps substantially.

The only halfway decent  part through the book was the &quot;fear beam.&quot; But after a name like  that, and how it was easily solved, made it like the rest of the book --  pathetic.

Since Deep Space Nine is THE best Star Trek series(look at Voyager), any book involving Deep Space Nine  would automatically be worth a read. Well, except &quot;The Laertian  Gamble&quot; and &quot;Vengeance.&quot;   Anyway, the single most  innovative plot twist(and that's saying alot, since the whole book is a  giant plot twist), was probably the Dax symbiont. All the characters are  believable, and I can see as well as hear them and their actions.   This  book explains how the Furies' were driven away, which in my opinion was a  need-to-know. Anyway, this is a breath of fresh air after the horrible  &quot;Soldiers...&quot; BUY THIS BOOK!	1999-01-05

This book was extremely well written, with enough gory descriptions to satisfy even me. The only reason I gave this book a &quot;4&quot; is because the characters are off at some points. I can see it all in my head,  except what they say sometimes doesn't fit their character.   But all in  all, a great book. Thankfully, Deep Space Nine came along to save the Trek  franchise from TNG, and later Voyager. And along with it comes a whole new  series of books.	1998-12-31

This book is as good as the other DS9 book in the Dominion War series. And, like that one, is FAR better than the pathetic TNG books in the series.   The mission to the Argolis Cluster is written here, which is way  cool.    The only real problem I had was that the USS Centaur was  destroyed, and the battle from &quot;Sacrifice of Angels&quot; was pretty  short.   But all in all, get this one and read it immediately!

The book starts out fairly good, but then once they go off into the gamma quadrant and meet the Jem'Hadar warship, it sucks. The Jem'Hadar act nothing like they do in the show, and neither do the changelings. The  changelings talk about the weather and other cultures, and they take Odo to  an outpost where changelings are just walking around.

Since Diane Carey is writing them, that immediately makes it good.   Anyway, the whole thing is excellent, and I  get to learn what happened on the mission to the Argolis Cluster.

There is little or no action until the very end, and I was hoping it would be epic space battles, which I got from the cover.    But the Enterprise is stuck in a starbase, and all the crew does is try to  help some pathetic commander. And when they do finally show up, it's too  obvious, and it was like an after-thought to add the rest of the crew in  the story.   The only two characters who really shined were Hasmek and  Geordi, since they weren't used that much, and Vornholt couldn't screw them  up.   The whole Badlands part is pointless.    I suggest to anybody that  you read the Deep Space Nine series, because they're awesome in comparison.    A war fits nicely into the Deep Space Nine universe, not The Next  Generation universe.	1998-11-11

After reading the first book, I was let down.   It starts out great, with a lot of action. The only problem I had was that  Jem'Hadar battlecruisers kept popping up everywhere, but you usually never  see those, you only see attack ships.   Plus, why does the Enterprise  always lower her shields before firing? They never had to do that before.    Once Picard starts on his way, it's still good, but near the end, it left  me hoping that L.A. Graf would somehow get to write Tunnel Through the  Stars, not John Vornholt.	1998-11-11

So when I heard they were going to make a novel series about the Dominion War, I was excited. When I read  the first story, Behind Enemy Lines, I thought it wasn't very good.   I was  hoping for a lot of action, and there is, but there are some strange  things. Such as: why does the Enterprise lower its shields every time it  fires? It never had to before.   And the Jem'Hadar ships are way too  powerful. If it was a battleship, I'd undestand. But you don't see those  alot in the Dominion fleet.    So one Jem'Hadar ship couldn't possibly  destroy an Ambassador-class starship, unless it was a battleship.   Besides  that, it's an average book. The beginning is excellent, then it degenerates  into just another book. The real highlight besides the beginning is the  Corzanium. That's a real original idea.   But no matter what, I wish L.A.  Graf would've written this.	1998-11-07

This book is a bit confusing if the reader didn't get the comic book that this book uses as a backstory for how the X-men got to the Enterprise's reality. And of course, Worf had to tag along. Well, let me put that another way: I think that Worf should be part of any Next Generation movie, but couldn't Friedman have written it better, so it wouldn't be pure coincidence that he happened to be on the Enterprise when the X-men appeared? Please, we're not morons. And two things nag me throughout the whole book: The Draa'kon, are bloodthirsty hate-mongers who want to control the universe. Oh my god, could Friedman have been any LESS imaginative?????? There's ALWAYS a bloodthirsty enemy!!!!!!!!! Another thing that nagged me was that when the Enterprise was fighting the Draa'kon, they didn't use quantum torpedoes, why? AND Friedman wrote that there was damage on deck 33, or something like that. But there are only 28 de! cks on the Enterprise-E. Please Friedman, try harder next time!	1998-07-31

The Ro/Kira thing was good, but I didn't think it was right that Ro and Kira took on a whole criminal ring and won.
