The third book is to come out this year, I believe.<br /><br />Patience and Dallas are a great couple.  Of course, there are the typical trials and tribulations as in every romance novel, and add a little suspense with a stalker, and you'll have a hit.<br /><br />This book I could not put down.  It's not my favorite Kat Martin book, but this ranks well up there.  Buy it.  You will not be disappointed.  :)	2005-01-28

I had this book and nursed reading it for a month.  Nothing really gripped me.  It's just like something you would see on a movie of the week or one on the lifetime channel.  I swear I've seen a movie basically identical to the whole story.  This was my first Diana Diamond book and it makes it obvious to me why she writes under a pseudonym.  Being associated to this book might hurt her other books sales.	2004-08-05

As you know from my other reviews on Judy Blume's adult books, I have had mixed feelings about them.  This one, there is no confusion whatsoever.  I found this book to be pretty boring.  There was no edge to it unless you count the exploration of lesbianism at about the age of 11 or 12.  I don't find that edgy.  I find that disturbing.  The book was highly predictable.  While it is a quick read, I wish I spent the time reading something more entertaining and substantial.  Wifey creeped me out, Smart Women was at least interesting, but this one was just a waste of time.  Ms. Blume spent a lot of time developing characters, but they weren't characters you care about in the end.  The only character that I did like was Caitlin's new stepmom, Abby.  The only good thing that happened in the book was that it ended.	2003-12-03

The characters are very well developed, and the book is extremely fast paced.  You will not find this one lagging at times like many other romance novels are.  Lisa Kleypa's has rapidly become one of my favorite romance novelists that ranks alongside Judith McNaught and Kat Martin.	2003-11-13

If you are ever able to get your hands on these books, which are unfortunately out of print, for your adolescent daughter, get them.

Plus, she was a dr. and for a long time I thought that was what I wanted to be.  Decided on a stay at home mom, but onto the review.  :)<br />This was my second Sandra Brown.  The first I read was Silken Web, which is my favorite, but this is just as good.  this book has twists and turns and just when you think that you have it all figured out you turn the page and think to yourself nevermind.  ha ha<br />Lara is your typical self-righteous heroine and Key is your typical rough around the edges hero with a heart of gold.  But that's where the typical part ends.  Believe me when I say you'll never get enough, and this one like Silken Web will earn a permanent place on your bookshelf.	2003-07-06

I remember being in elementary school and my 3rd grade teacher reading us Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing and Super Fudge.  So, when I was 23 and saw an adult Judy Blume book I picked it up mainly out of nostalgia.  This was an author that I loved as a child and thought she was writing this just for me.<br />boy was I deluded.  lol  It's a really good book, but I just had the creepiest feeling while reading it.  It just felt so wrong to me.  I had the hardest time finishing it.  I think as long as you've never read any of her kid's books when you were a child you should be fine reading this one.	2003-07-06

Not normally one for love triangles, this story captured my heart from page one and never let go until the end.  And when you are done you can breathe a sigh of relief knowing that everything ends as it should, and turn back to page one and begin again.<br />This book is fast paced and doesn't slow down as many books do.

Not every book can be the best, and as usual, people tend to forget that.  This was one of Sandra Brown's books that was written before she became popular and was written under a pen name.  Of course she has improved over time.  That happens with everyone.  It's the old practice makes perfect line.<br />This book was a good read.  It's not anything heavy and it's not a book that's going to keep you up all night.  It's only 256 pages long and the print is pretty large.  This is a great book for a plane ride or while sitting on the beach.  Sometimes you want to read something that's nice and light, and this book suits that.<br />Take the time and read this one.

This book is not a murder mystery but more of a mystery of what happens in a clinic.  You find out the murderer early on in the book.  within the first few chapters as a matter of fact.  this book is filled with interesting descriptions of the characters, their actions, and just amazing ideas for a book that was written in the early 80's.  Makes you wonder about the things that are actually happening today.  this book is truly fascinating and one that you will not be able to put down.

In a few ways I enjoyed it, but in just as many I did not, and while sitting here, I am not sure why exactly.  I wasn't confused by the storyline, but it didn't grab me, and I think that's what I am having the most difficulty with.<br />I guessed the killer, \\"Evil,\\" very early in the book, so I suppose that's what deflated it for me.  I read this book at the recommendation of my mother.  My mom has just started discovering thriller books, and this was one of her first ventures and she enjoyed it.  I guess since I've been reading them for as long as I can remember I am a better judge of them at this point.<br />I had this book for about 3 months before I finally sat down and made it through the whole thing.  I read the first few chapters and while the first part of the book was interesting it quickly slowed down to dragging by the middle.  I kept giving up on it and starting another book, only to restart this one about 3 or 4 times.  I finally finished it last week.<br />About the 3rd quarter of the book it picked up again, but then towards the end it went back to a crawl, and I was left feeling bored by the time I finished it.  I keep thinking back to it, and there were several parts of the book that I enjoyed, but I'm not sure if I'm going to continue on with the series.  I might try the next one to see if this is one of those types of series that you have to take in as a whole.	2003-07-06

No other books of VC Andrews will get 5 stars unless they are the Flowers In the Attic series.  You just cannot top those, but this is a great book.  The Cutler series is very good, and this is the best book out of the whole thing.  You just have to read the other books along with it to keep your timeline straight.  You don't want to miss a minute.  It keeps with the same pattern as VC Andrews books.  First book introduces you to the new family and the main characters, the 2nd book they are of teenage years, 3rd they are pretty much grown up starting their own family, 4th is from their children's perspective, and 5th is taking you back to before the series began so you can find out why a main character that caused the heroine the distress was the way they were.  It's fabulous that it is done this way, because when you finish them all you truly feel like you are a part of the family and that you know everything that you need to know about them.  There are no loose ends when you finish and you feel totally satisfied and are able to move onto another series.  Give the Cutler world a try, you'll be glad you did.	2003-07-04

Not quite as horrific a life as Cathy led, but Dawn was well developed and it was very intriguing.  Enough to make me get the rest of the books and continue reading.

I read this book for the very first time when I was in 6th grade (12 years old), and like many others it led to the reading of hundreds of other books.  I am now 24, with a 3 year old daughter, and cannot wait until she is old enough for me to hand her my copy and hope she develops a love for reading as I have.  I always did exceedingly well in reading in school, but I did not enjoy it.  But all that changed when a friend of mine finished reading this book, and she passed it along to me.<br />I will never forget the day when I cracked open the book to the first page.  I remember that I saw the movie that was based on this book, and I thought it was totally creepy and just had to give the book a try.  I remember my mom wouldn't buy it for me b/c she didn't think I was old enough for it at the time, but fate eventually interceded and I was given the opportunity of a lifetime.<br />This book is fabulous.  Read it yourself or give it as a gift to someone that doesn't typically like to read.  All that will change and they too will become addicted and have to read all of her series.  All are great with the exception of the new series'.  You can definitely tell the new ones were not written by VC.  VC Andrews has a pattern and that's what makes them so good.  The new ones unfortunately do not.<br />So, if you want to start a new author, or are just reliving the experience of a great book, pick up Flowers in the Attic.  You will not be disappointed.  And, of course, continue on thru Petals on the Wind, If There Be Thorns, Seeds of Yesterday, and Garden of Shadows.  You will never be left hanging because the series tie up all the loose ends within the 5 books.  And when you are done, move on to the Cutler series and all the others.  They are great as well.	2003-07-04

It wasn't your typical Judith McNaught, but in my eyes she can do no wrong.  I think she did a great job making an attempt to broaden her base by writing more of a suspense novel instead of romance.

Your favorite book tends to be the one that you picked up when you first started reading a certain author.  For me, it was Paradise, for a lot of others it was Whitney, My Love.<br />That being said, I truly believe people are being extra harsh in reviewing this book.  No, I don't think it's her best book, but it was a fun read.  I was not disappointed in the characters or the story.  I found them to be a great couple and I liked the events that took place.  I love Judith's writing style, and the way she is able to take you into the character's realm whether that is medieval times or the present.<br />I think if you are looking for a good story that's fun to read, this would be a terrific option for you.  If you want to read something that's more memorable, pick up Paradise or Perfect.  If you like historical more, pick up her books Something Wonderful and Almost Perfect.<br />Just whatever you do, sit down and want to have fun with a book and let it do it's job and take you to these places.	2003-07-03
US	50472053	R3PSG8DSYI90DP	0743419162	604430790	Fanning the Flame	Books	4	5	6	N	N	Definitely worthwhile	This was the first Kat Martin book I had ever read.  My mother in law bought this book and a Lisa Kleypa's book, Lady Sophia's Lover at the same time.  She read the Kleypas book while I read Kat Martin's book, and then we switched.  This books was great.  Prior to this, I was never into romance books, and especially not historical romance.  Heaving bosoms were not my thing.  Give me a good mystery or some true crime.<br />But after I read this book, I was hooked.  I devour every Kat Martin book I can get my hands on.  My mother in law and I like to go to thrift stores all the time, and I usually manage to get a ton of books for very little money, and I have found tons of Kat Martin books for about 50 cents a piece.  Can't beat that.<br />This one is totally worth the regular price though.  Grab it and enjoy.	2003-07-03
US	50472053	RSLNLLFMG1GOI	0743419154	759611923	The Fire Inside	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Marry me Clay...	That says it all.  I like many others read this book out of sync in the trilogy.  I started with Fanning the Flame and then this one and still have the first one to go yet.  The characters are terrific with the bantering and then the love that develops.  I too was slightly disappointed with Kitt's sudden departure.  After she was able to stand up to her domineering father, you'd think she had enough gumption to stick it out with Clay.  But alas, that is what makes romance novels.  Girl meets guy, they fall in love, huge misunderstanding, and then the huge reunion.  Always have to make the readers want to fight for the characters.  Give this one a try.  I'm not upset that I read it out of order, heck I didn't even realize it really until after I read the other reviews.  I did see cross over characters, but it doesn't hurt the continuity of the books.	2003-07-03

The plot moved quickly, but at times very predictable.  Good for a plane ride, or vacation reading.  Easy to put down and come back to later.  Worth picking up to read.	2003-07-03

That way if you never get around to it, you won't be bad off.  Might actually be better for it.<br />I've read the reviews on this one, and it's not as bad as most are making it out to be.  I wonder if people didn't finish the entire thing b/c then you'd understand why the main characters were who they were and why they acted that way.<br />this is not my favorite.  this one is probably my least favorite, but my least favorite of Judith McNaught is a lot better than a lot of other authors best.  While that doesn't excuse it, it is fact.<br />This is a shorter book, so it does move along pretty quickly.  Most of Judith McNaught's books approach 700 pages, and this is only 300 or so.  Give it a try, I don't regret it.  It makes for a decent book on a plane or on the beach.	2003-07-03

I would normally give it 4.5 stars b/c no other book is better than Judith McNaught's Paradise, but then she brings in Matt and Meredith into Perfect.  Gives it that nudge to 4.999999 stars.  :)<br />I have read and reread this book almost as many times as Paradise.  I just love it.  I love Zack and Julie almost as much as Matt and Meredith.  I was laughing and crying through the whole thing.  Paradise and Perfect make you feel for the main characters, and that's what Judith McNaught does best.  You care about what happens with all her characters, even the not-so-important ones.  And what is really awesome is they have a double book that has Paradise and Perfect in one.  Get that version if you can, because as soon as you finish one, you'll want to start the next.	2003-07-03

This is a prequel to Whitney, My Love, and it was an excellent foray into medieval romance.  A first for me.  I enjoyed it from page one, and have kept this on my shelf so I can read it again later.

Once I find an author I enjoy, I have this tendency to read every single book they have, and then I have to find someone new which can be very difficult.<br />Judith McNaught was this someone new.  I absolutely adore this book.  I have it in paperback, and I've worn it out rereading it, and managed to find it in hardcover.  Buy it in hardcover if you can find it, because you will return to it time and time again when faced with a book drought so to speak.<br />I laughed and cried with Matt and Meredith.  You become such a part of their world, and feel that you know these people.  And boy does she leave you wanting more and more.  I know that she can't write about these characters forever, but I sure would love another trip into Matt and Meredith's lives.<br />Pick this book up as soon as you can, and you'll never want to put it down again.  If you've never read a Judith McNaught book, this is one of the best places to start.  I've read every book of hers within 6 months, and I'm just dying for more.  Unfortunately, I'm back in that book drought again, but at least I have the Farrell's to come home to.  :)	2003-07-03

I love Kat Martin, and have been reviewing all the books of hers that I read today.  this is definitely one of my faves.  She is just awesome.  There is passion and romance, and you can just feel it coming off the pages as soon as you crack open the book.  Grab this one when you can, and you won't put it down.	2003-07-03

The story, the characters, the romance, even the cover of the book is gorgeous.  I finished it on New Years Day, and what a perfect way to start the new year.  I handed it off to my mother in law as soon as I finished it, and she read it the next day.  We both just loved it.	2003-07-03

As I've said in other reviews, historical is not my favorite because I get really tired of all the earls, dukes, baronesses, etc.  Just say their name, and that's good enough for me.  lol  But I totally fell in love with Ian.  I loved him even more than Clayton from Whitney, My Love, which can get me in trouble since there are some serious Clayton lovers out there.  Sorry if I offend anybody.<br />Take the time to get this book.  You will not be disappointed.	2003-07-03

While this one is not my favorite, I did enjoy it.  I prefer the contemporary stories she has more, but it was another page turner.  She spun her web around me, and I was caught until the end of the book, as always.  Whether you enjoy historical romance or contemporary, Judith McNaught will make you a fan of both.	2003-07-03

I enjoy historical romances, but I eventually become tired of all the dukes and earls and whatnot.  So it always pleases me when I can find a decent contemporary romance.  Add a little suspense and maybe some mystery and man I am one happy camper.  This did all those things for me.  Grab this one if you can, and read it.  You'll definitely enjoy it.  I know I did.	2003-07-03

Most likely because it was from Nick Gentry's point of view as opposed to the heroine.  But it was definitely worthwhile.  This is the 3rd Lisa Kleypas book I've read, and all of hers have been great.  This was the perfect sequel to Lady Sophia's Lover.  It was great to know what happened to Sophia, and get more story of Nick.  I read this in one evening it was so good.  It grabs you from page one.	2003-07-03

I first read this book in the paperback edition, and I enjoyed it.  Not my favorite Judith McNaught book, because that's Paradise, and I still can't get over that one, but it's a great book nonetheless.  Clayton and Whitney are an amazing couple, and Judith McNaught spun this creation with a vivid imagination and only be described as loaned from God.<br />The hard cover is great because it picks up a little of what was left off of the paperback.  And it just continues to add to the story.  The paperback edition ends a little abruptly, so the hardcover takes care of the loose ends that you might feel.  It's also great b/c other books were spun off from this one that I thoroughly enjoyed as well.	2003-07-03

She could never write too many for me.  :)  Just the imagination that she has to have in order to come up with this kind of book amazes me.  Oh, to have her brain and gifts.  This is definitely a page turner.  Grab a copy and enjoy.	2003-07-03
