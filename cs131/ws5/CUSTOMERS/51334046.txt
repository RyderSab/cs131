About half way through Subterranean I realized that it was almost exactly the same story, only below ground.  I wouldn't have minded this so much, but the book was full of endless chase scenes which were all very similar.  About half the book could have been successfully edited out.  It would have vastly improved the pacing.  Also, a few of the plot devices and characters were absurd or trite, such as The Arab Terrorist, and The Helpless Woman.  I found myself becoming more and more annoyed at the characters as the story continued.	2005-06-18

This book is much too technical for the general reader.  The author repeatedly uses jargon without any explaination of what it means.  I have a background in biological science and like to keep up to date on  physical science.  I have previously read extensively on string theory, yet I found myself repeatedly adrift in this book wondering what on earth the author was talking about.	2005-03-05

If the Spanish, Portuguese, and Italians were not busy with the human sacrifice of witches it is because they were too occupied burning Jews alive at the stake.  Christians also spent a lot of time persecuting Islamics (the Crusades) and each other - Catholics vs. Protestants.  Christianity has a lot of good points, but one of the supreme failures is its incredible hypocrasy.  They say - love your neighbor, love your enemy - then they kill him.	2005-01-15

The author made many statements in this book which revealed an amazing ignorance of what science is - and this in a book which claims to be about the collision of science and religion.  It isn't that he doesen't know much about science - he doesn't - but that he doesn't even possess the most basic understanding of how science works and investigates.  He seems to believe that science should operate like religion.  They are not the same thing at all.  Science is changeable and flexible.  When new information comes in, as it does constantly, the theories change.  This is quite unlike religion, which sticks to the same theory no matter what evidence is presented to disprove it.	2005-01-13

The good guys were perfect, while the bad guys were a little too vile for my taste.  Also, the &quot;don't mess with humanity&quot; theme was hammered in a bit too much.

It used to be Jews, or women (witches).  Jews, no matter how poor and downtrodden they seemed, were actually bent on world domination.  Women - your wife, mother, daughter - were possessed of secret powers straight from the devil.  Now it's the gays' turn.  They are rich, powerful, subversive, out to torpedo all morality and goodness in this world.  But maybe the people who are out to control the world are the exact same people who have been controling it for centuries - religious extremists.	2004-05-22

I read this book, among others, to try to understand why the Catholic Church is self-desructing.  Now I can understand why.  Everyone in the book is crazy.  The liberal theologians who the author claims now run the seminaries are crazy.  The orthodox priests the author is defending are crazy.  No one, especially the author, seems to realize that the weird activity in which these various groups of people are engaged is masking the fact that they have completely forgotten what the search for the Divine is all about.  Their only interest seems to be in form, not substance.  They go through the motions, say the magic words, turn the crank, and out pops God!  They have made it so easy!  And so completely empty and meaningless.  I hope God isn't as rigid, uninspired, and brain dead as these people seem to be.	2004-05-22

As a teacher I always thought education was supposed to present opposing points of view, to stimulate people to think.  The author, instead, believes that education's purpose is to brainwash.  Catholic Church teaching CAN be wrong.  The Church spent 400 years insisting that the Sun goes around the Earth and threatened to put Galileo to death for saying otherwise.  Of course, the Church is free to teach what it likes to the faithful, but in our present day the Church tries to force its highly political agenda on people who are not Catholic or even Christian.  There ARE other points of view.  It is important that seminarians be aware of them.  It is important that Catholics no longer be taught that they have the right to execute other people for not believing as they do (Jews and Islamics, for example).  A reader left a comment that the Catholic Church does not believe in persecuting people of other faiths. How ignorant. The Spanish Inquisition - you never heard of it?  The horrific persecution of the natives in Mexico, Central America, and South America for continuing to follow their traditional religions - you never heard of that either?  What about witch hunts?  There is a thing called \\"history.\\"  You might try learning some.	2004-05-10

The author discusses what the main character had for breakfast in the same tone as she discusses finding a dead body.  &quot;I had huevos rancheros and strong coffee.  Then I found a body under the pile of rubble.&quot;  Blah, blah, blah.  There was NO tension, NO excitement in the writing.

The stories in this book are horrifying.  Even more horrifying are the continuing efforts of the Church to protect these abusers, as witnessed by the latest round of revelations (2002).
