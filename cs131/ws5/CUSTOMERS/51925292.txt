Sometimes, however, someone will swap with someone else who decides that they don't want to swap back.  Against this backdrop, we find five friends who were raised together at an orphanage by monks, and we see how far they are willing to go for one another, blah, blah, blah, blah.  The main core of three include an artist, a guy who swaps his body for money with people having surgery or other unpleasant ordeals, and a girl on a major quest to \\"find herself.\\"  The decription of the plot beyond that on the book jacket is inaccurate, by the way. <br />I enjoyed the book well enough, but I approached it specifically as a Kevin Anderson book: not particularly deep but engaging enough.  He didn't explain the mechanics of swapping, and I can get over that, but there are so many other things he could have done with the whole concept of swapping bodies, both logistically and ethically.  The characters were endearing enough, though they were essentially walking, talking sterotypes (broad strokes, broad strokes).  But I was entertained, and for that I give it 3 stars.	2005-07-20

She believes that he visits her at night while she is sleeping.  She also begins to fit together fragments of his life that were unknown to her while he was alive, and they fit together into a rather strange whole --- including evidence that Hut was part of a secret project when he was a child that tested psychic abilities in children. <br /> <br />AFTERLIFE was a page-turner and a good, fast read.  It was well-written and suspenseful and has some great twists and turns.  The book seemed quite different from other Clegg works that I have read.  There were some creepy moments, but the book didn't really seem likea mega-horror book to me.  But don't let that stop you from reading it!	2005-01-18

He becomes obsessed with an ancestor, an alleged warlock named Joseph Curwen who escaped persecution in Salem over 200 years before and fled to Providence.  A unusually long-lived ancestor, I might add. <br /> <br />If you aren't used to reading Lovecraft, or other writers of the same time period, the language and writing style might be a little tough at first, but it is well worth getting into.  Lovecraft leaves a lot to the imagination of the reader --- a device that works quite well in this story.   <br /> <br />This is one of my favorite novellas --- actually, one of my favorite stories, even.  I first read when I was in high school, and I have re-read it every few years ever since.  I re-read it again a couple of days ago and I still love it.  This is Lovecraft at his best.	2005-01-14

Thomas lives with his 3 brothers, who are conjoined triplets joined at the head and sharing a brain.  His best friend is an often naked, prophetic preacher. There are two filmmaking students who are staying with Thomas while making a documentary, and one of them falls in love with one of the triplets while there.  Oh, yeah, and there is also the \\"swamp girl\\" who lives with them.  There are also one-legged child-murderers, their dead victims, swamp witches who cut off bits of themselves to stave off the coming storm, and bizarre canvivals.  All of these elements come together wonderfully o tell a very strange tale.  <br /> <br />A Choir of Ill Children is simultaneously lovely and disturbing, lyrical and horrific.  Piccarilli's prose has a poetry about it, even while it is describing something horrible.  Parts of the story reminded me of kudzu (hey, the story is southern gothic, so that leads me to kudzu): green and vibrant, and hiding god only knows what underneath.  I loved this book.  It was one of my favorite reads of the past year.  I highly recommend it.	2005-01-11

A magistrate and his clerk are summoned to the Carolinas in 1699 to try the case of an accused witch, who appears to have a damning case against her.  Matthew, the clerk, is not convinced that the woman is actually a witch, but may simply be the scapegoat in an elaborate plot to cause the fledgling town of Fount Royal to fail. <br /> <br />This novel is a well-written mystery that, despite it's length, kept me on the edge of my seat, so to speak.  McCammon captures the time period without bogging the reader down in it.  I enjoyed the book, and thought it to be one of McCammon's best, though it is very different from his other novels.  There are very few horror elements in the story, so I can see how it might alienate a few long-time fans of the author's.  But my advice (as a longtime fan myself) is to give it a chance --- you won't be disappointed.	2005-01-10

A horror writer and his daughter move into a (you guessed it!) haunted house on the California coast.  The writer believes that the house will inspire him for his new book.  Well, yeah, I guess it does.  The house is haunted by an evil teenaged voodoo priestess prostitute (trust me, it works) who murdered a bunch of people and trapped their souls in a bunch of weird little anatomically-correct dolls that she made to look like her victims before she herself was murdered in 1915.  Just to make things even more fun, her spirit can influence living people and possess some of them, and her presence is accompanied by the strong odors of jasmine and rotting flesh.  Yay?  <br />This book was a great ride and hard to put down.  The characters were vivid and the story well-told.  I love the way Tamara Thorne's mind works.  She is one sick puppy with a weird sense of humor.  Cool.  Though it is a very real possibility that I will never wear jasmine again.  Or rotting flesh, but that is another story entirely.....  No poodles were harmed in this one (unlike her novel Bad Things) --- just real estate agents.  And sailors.  And some hippies.  No poodles though.	2004-06-29

He joins her and a few other denizens from London Below --- such as the (ah, hell, why not?) irrepressible Marquis de Carabbas and the rather intense Hunter --- in her search for the Angel Islington, whom Door's father told her she could trust right before he and the rest of Door's family were murdered by two henchmen named Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar (who were hilarious, by the way).<br />Gaiman obviously had a lot of fun with names of tube stops and prominent places in London and with the possibilities for parallels between London Below and London Above.  I loved the sense of wonder and the sense of humor in Neverwhere, though both were balanced by the sense of darkness in the story.  Quintessential Gaiman.  A wonderful and imaginative book.	2004-06-29

Pirates seize the ship and take the survivors to their floating city Armada to become a part of that rather unorthodox society.<BR>The characters and the society and culture of Armada are very detailed and well thought out.  There are bizarre characters, monsters, magic, secrets, and intrigue.  The language and descriptions are effective and beautiful.  I have not yet read PERDIDO STREET STATION (though I plan to remedy that very soon), but that did not hamper my reading of THE SCAR in any way that I was aware of.<BR>THE SCAR is one of the most unusual books that I have read in a long time and it is one I will read again.	2004-04-25

The contributing authors include Jeffrey Thomas, William P. Simmons, Scott Thomas, Charlee Jacob, and Stephen Mark Rainey.  To me, all of this implied that there would be a bunch of nice, scary Halloween stories in the book.  Ummm...nope, not really.  I found most of the stories to be more disturbing than scary.  And not Jack Ketchum or Edward Lee disturbing where you are unnerved for quite a while afterwards.  Don't get me wrong, there were a few good stories in here (I thought): &quot;Post #153&quot; by Jeffrey Thomas, in which a VFW is surrounded by some familiar apparitions was quite chilling.  I also enjoyed &quot;The Halloween Boy&quot; by William P. Simmons, which was about a very strange little boy --- though I would say that it was far more haunting than scary.  All in all, though I enjoyed some of the stories in this anthology, I found it overall to be a rather disappointing read.	2004-01-06

In this supposedly idyllic time and in an \\"All-American\\" suburb there is this deep, dark undercurrent of insanity and violence that you don't expect to find there.  But the narrative takes you beyond simple unease.  It takes you into the mind of the boy who watches the awful abuse of the girl Meg until you become a voyeur to the violence as well.  This was a hard book to read and I literally felt wrung out and dirty after reading it.  Ketchum doesn't pull any punches in his writing, though you may find that you wish he had.  So why did I give the book 5 stars, you may ask?  The book is unforgettably powerful, evocative, and well-written, and I shuuder a little every time I look at it.  Excellent horror realism.	2004-01-03

To me this book is an excellent example of well-written soft science fiction.  The story's somewhat disjointed narrative works well to evoke the narrator's jumbled memories of the events leading to the decimation of the human population.  The character of Oryx doesn't seem very well fleshed out, and there is the sense that she just functions as a narrative jumping off point for the changing relationship between Snowman and Crake, but as a whole, the characters were still believable to me.  Atwood doesn't describe the science used in much depth, and what she does explain is a bit questionable in places, but I found the story to be very effective and literate nonetheless.  And the pigoons freaked me out.	2003-12-28

Creepy, creepy children.  Beau (a bit creepy) and his sisters (not so creepy) visit their grandmother (kind of creepy in her own right) on Gull Island every summer. Their cousin Sumter (way creepy) visits at the same time.  Beau and Sumter form a friendship mostly based on their secret place, Neverland, where they perform rituals and play increasingly bizarre games, and where Sumter grows ... well ... creepier and creepier. <BR>This novel was chilling and very good.  I'll admit, I'm a sucker for creepy-children-coming-of-age-stories, and this one does not disappoint.  Sumter is an absolute little freak, so if you also like creepy children stories, then Sumter is your boy.  A very worthy addition to the creepy, out-of-control children sub-genre of horror stories.	2003-11-30

A former patient convinces him, however, to visit a healer who she say cured her of her cancer.

Once there, Will is subjected to many trials in order to find &quot;the fifth harmonic,&quot; which will effect his cure, but he has to fight his increasing physical weakness as the cancer takes over his body and, as an added bonus, he finds out that Maya is not all she appears to be.<BR>This book is awe-inspiring.  Wilson makes you care about the characters and draws you further into them in each section of the book by his inward-shifting narrative style throughout each part of his journey.  Wilson is a brilliant writer.	2003-11-30

Okay, fine --- my grandparents have told me about their experiences with those different perceptions.  Brodkin then tries to illustrate these changing perceptions in her book.

There are stories about assassin mannequins, mutant humans and shopping, malevolent wraiths, inter-dimensional baby-stealers, golem fighters, healer bugs, and killer viruses, just to mention a few.  I am a fan of both science fiction and horror, and I enjoy stories that combine the two also so this book was a nice surprise to me because it handled both genres well.	2003-10-04

Demons are there to torture you and roving bands of angels often cause even more pain than their demon counterparts as they hunt humans for sport.  Letters from Hades is a man's diary of his time spent in Hell, where he rescues a beautiful demon and falls in love with her.

Kress' writing style is clear and her prose does not get in the way of the story and the characters, though not all totally three dimensional, were, for the most part, fleshed out nicely.  I especially enjoyed the character of Enli, the Worlder who has to spy on the humans in order to atone for her crime and become &quot;real&quot; again so she can again truly be an insider in her culture.  I also liked the fact that the plot was driven by a combination of physics and anthropology, a usually uneasy marriage of disciplines.  Many previous reviewers obviously did not care for the book, but I liked it and will read more of her work, including the sequel Probability Sun.  So there.	2003-09-23

Anyone expecting horror will be disappointed in this novel, which I found to be reminiscent of --- although not necessarily derrivative of --- Anne Rice's vampire novels.  Like Rice's novels, this book was more of an erotic vampire story than a horror story.  Even the cover art makes it fairly obvious that the novel is a \\"bodice-ripper\\" with fangs.  The story was predictable, but it was a smooth and enjoyable read and I enjoyed Yarbro's writing style. Though it ready annoyed me that every time she mentioned a door in the story she called it a \\"french door.\\"  Since the story takes place in France, I found that rather irritating.  I gave the book 4 stars on the Amazon rating scale, but 3 1/2 stars would better reflect my feelings about the book.	2003-08-27

Bad things happen (eventually).  Gillian breaks into someone's home and vacations there while the owner is away.  Bad things happen (eventually).  The two stories come crashing together rather suddenly (as we, of course, have by then figured out they must).  The end.<BR>Don't get me wrong, this book was basically well-written and was pretty much a page-turner throughout, but it's not one that is going to stay with me for very long.

They soon discover that all is not right with the little town and the fort by the sea (of course, because this is a horror novel, after all), and find that they, and especially the young child David, are in mortal danger when these creepy, red, warrior, zombiesque creatures rise out of the sea and plant themselves outside the walls of the fort.  The inhabitants of the town also take refuge within the walls of the fort, and then actual zombies show up, adding to the intensity of the confrontation.  <BR>I enjoyed this one.  Clark is very good at evoking a  strong sense of atmosphere in his tales and at describing images that are frightening on an almost primal level.  He brings to life the coastal fort and the creatures that pop up out of the water and fog to threaten it.  I give the book 4 instead of 5 stars because it reads a little choppily in parts, as if it were perhaps edited badly, and because the underlyting theme of sacrifice comes across as a bit forced in places.  It is still quite a creepy book.	2003-07-28

I wasn't disappointed.  I found the book to be genuinely creepy.  <BR>The basic premise is that in the ruins of a burned down church, there is a stone font in which a woman believes the soul of her son to be trapped, despite the fact that her son is still alive.  The only person who believes her at all is a researcher whom is also a &quot;sensitive.&quot;  The are those who believe the font to be evil, and there there have been several suicides committed near it.  The plot evolves from there to encompass ESP, demons, ancient protectors, and possession.  <BR>I really enjoyed the book and the ideas put forth in it, though I found it to be a bit awkwardly written in many places, which is why I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5.  Some scenes were a bit confusing and there were words and phrases that were used repeatedly within the same paragraph or two, almost as if there were no editor.  I found that to be a little distracting at times, but I would still recommend the book.	2003-07-08

I agree with the reader from Austin that this book was very disappointing. To me, it seemed as if Shattuck couldn't decide whether the book should be literary criticism or historical overview or a chance for him to air out his morals. He tried to do all three at once, resulting in a bit of a mess. He kept switching back and forth between objective history lesson and subjective moralizing to the point where the points he professed to be trying to make became somewhat lost and pointless. The objective bits were dry and boring and the moralizing was condescending and annoying and insulting to the reader.	2003-04-07

I won't lie to you, this one is a rough read --- not due to the prose, but due to the subject matter.  Usually I avoid horror and sci-fi books about The Holocaust, because I feel that they belittle it by just using it as a convenient setting that is so horrific on its own that the author feels they do not have to expend much effort, and as a Jew it kind of pisses me off that they seem to find The Holocaust as little more than that.  This book is an exception, however.  The Holocaust is used as a backdrop for a story about ethics, a \\"what would you do if you had the chance\\" question.	2003-03-03
US	51925292	R2ETOA5I6ZNIS7	0671664255	75263482	GOAT DANCE	Books	4	15	17	N	N	Early Clegg	Don't let the title or the cover art put you off, because this book isn't another one of those tedious, repetitive, done-to-death \\"Oooh-look-it's-Satan\\" novels. In fact, Satan (or Memnoch, as Anne Rice would call him) does not even put in an appearance.  Instead it's a young-man-returns-after-many-years-to-the-town-he-grew-up-in-and-where-something-bad-happened-when-he-was-a-kid novels.  Most horror writers seem to have written at least one, but this one is very well done nonetheless.  The plot overview has already been iterated in previous reviews, so I won't add another one to the pile, but you get the idea.<br />It is all too easy to compare Douglas Clegg to Stephen King, but that is because there are some similarities in their narrative styles, though Clegg's descriptions are possibly more vivid.<br />I liked this book and think that it is worth tracking down.	2002-11-16

When a young women performs a ritual in the woods, she unintentionally awakens three who were condemned as witches three hundred years before. I'll admit that I was a bit concerned when I first began reading the book that it would just be another variation of the whole \\"witches condemned 300 years ago and now they're back for revenge\\" idea, but I was very pleasantly surprised once I read on because there was more to it than that. <br />The female characters are convincing and the book well-written, plus there are some good scary moments. I really enjoyed this book. It was hard for me to put down.	2002-11-16

It's one of those that it is probably best not to over-analyze, due to things like the insertion of Norse gods into the plot and the sociopath with a heart of gold. Nevertheless, it is still a good, spooky read. You have English fog, a creepy hotel, and bald, Max Schreck-looking, semi-mindless vampires running around the sewer system --- what more could a horror fan want?	2002-10-26
US	51925292	R1QUOD0OKNT5G	0375507779	122553244	The Talisman	Books	5	1	1	N	N	One of King's and of Straub's best	Twelve-year-old Jack has to travel across the country and across worlds to save his mother's life.  He is seeking the Talisman, an object of great power.  Along the way, he encounters many allies and enemies --- as well as their counterparts --- in both worlds, and finds that his entire life has been leading up to this journey.<BR>I absolutely loved The Talisman.  It is one of my favorite books.  I enjoy the idea of the alternate worlds, thought I realize that this execution of it doesn't hold up to logical examination (like most fiction that incorporates the idea of alternate worlds/realities), but is still very entertaining. The book has an interesting and well thought-out plot, and it doesn't suffer from as much excess verbiage as you would expect from a King/Straub collaboration.	2002-10-26

At first, I was like, \\"Oh god no, not another horror novel with Nazi's in it!\\" because that theme has tended to be overused in horror from time to time, but I was pleasantly surprised.  <BR>German soldiers and Nazi's have been assigned to guard and protect a mysterious stone structure with a tower.  However, there is something already there that doesn't want them for company.	2002-10-26

I thought it better than Tales of the Body Thief, but that is not saying a whole lot.  I think a lot of the problem is that I am just getting tired of L'Estat's whining, and tortured, repentant vampires in general, even when they do meet god and the devil.	2002-10-26

Brief plot synopsis: Some of the dead are walking, and the father of the book's protagonist is one of them. Miles must figure out why his father and the others are walking and what the connection between the walkers is. <br />... <br />The prologue completely creeped me out. Then, most of the rest of the book was also pretty creepy and a really smooth read. And then the book just kind of ended, and the epilogue was cheesy. I felt really let down, to the point where it was hard not to think about it...<br />Despite the ending, I still feel that this book is worth recommending, but it is not one that I will keep on my shelves.	2002-10-05

Okay, they are identical except for the fact that Robin doesn't have legs.  Now there is another difference as well: Robin has been possessed by a greenjack, a kind of hellish nature-sprite, and he wants Ricky to be possessed also.  (Gabba gabba hey!)<br />Fast forward several years: Rick is all grown up now with children of his own.  He moves his family back to the family home and to the greenjacks.<br />I absolutely loved this book!  Tamara Thorne can be one sick (albeit creatively) puppy, and she must really dislike poodles, but this book was a great read.  There is a demented humor undercurrent to the book that I enjoyed, and the book is genuinely creepy --- and, at times, disturbing.  I'll never look at little old ladies and poodles the same way again, or want to have a house with secret passages and a big yard.  Did I mention that I love this book?	2002-10-05
US	51925292	R3UO2S4H7PSSPL	0451198786	266969050	Darker Than Night	Books	4	6	6	N	N	Well-written horror with great descriptions	This is the first book that I have read by Owl Goingback.  I fully intend to read others. The novel is very well written and the prose very evokative at times.  For example, the opening paragraph of the novel describes the darkness as moving &quot;over the land like a hungry beast...scurrying up the driveway to press its cold black nose against the windows of an old farmhouse.&quot;  <BR>The novel is about a horror novelist who moves his family from New York to Missouri into the house that he grew up in after his grandmother dies.  After they move into the house, they find ample evidence of what they believe to be her &quot;eccentricities.&quot; But after a while, they discover that maybe she knew what she was doing after all.<BR>The book had several creepy moments, but also had a lot of predictable ones.  Overall though, it was an enjoyable read.	2002-09-16

She no longer exists to her people, and must take on a new identity to begin her quest to right the great wrong that she has brought down onto the earth.  She loses everyone and everything that she loves, and she must learn to face herself, as well as her fears.<br />This is a lovely book that is well-worth seeking out.	2002-09-07

His tales tend to have plotlines that you will not find in other writers' stories, and he has a dark sense of humor that will make you feel almost guilty for finding some of the bits funny.  Not all of these stories are actually horror stories, but those that are will probably still disturb you even after you have put down the book.  Almost all of the stories in this collection stood out to me for one reason or another, but the stories that made the deepest impression on me were \\"Love Doll: A Fable,\\" \\"Bubba Ho-Tep,\\" \\"Drive-in Date,\\" and \\"In the Cold Dark Time.\\"  These four stories stand out to me as being the most exemplary of Lansdale's unique voice.  However, \\"Godzilla's Twelve Step Program\\" is the story that is the most \\"fun\\" in the book.	2002-09-05
