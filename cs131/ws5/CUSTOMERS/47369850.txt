With self-help books infusing society's shelves and more added daily, it gets difficult to cut the wheat from the chaff.  What works for some, doesn't work for others and non-needed confusion may set in, defeating the entire purpose!  Seemingly half the population is in therapy  (be it with a certified shrink or Oprah), and there is nothing wrong with searching for personal improvement. However, a cold dose of reality can be truly refreshing.<br />Rosenblatt, TIME editor-at-large, supplies humorous cut-to-the-bone advice in, \\"Rules for Aging: Resist Normal Impulses, Live Longer, Attain Perfection.\\" He's quick on the uptake and profoundly in your face--which works, if you allow yourself to take confessional responsibility. When I read a passage, &quot;If something is boring you, it is probably you.&quot; ,  I gulppingly realized, hey, the guy is right.<br />Though bitingly cynical at times, his advice on everything from party etiquette to office politics  (&quot;Never work for anyone more insecure than yourself&quot;) is also delightfully smart and funny. A hilarious read of wisdom, even for those not in need of self-help.	2000-12-19

So, when he purchased this book, I must admit I feigned polite interest. After thumbing through pages of classy, glossy dream vehicles--- I was hooked.  This was no ordinary book on cars. This was eye candy with all pedals to the metal.<br />Photographer Lewis relates that ad agencies would urge her to shoot cars in studio setups. But she always preferred to go on location to wait until the dawn sky &quot;radiated a glow that rolls like warm caramel across a car's sheet metal.&quot;<br />That glow rolls through the pages of this sumptuous photographic history of the American motor car. The book starts with the Model T (costing $850 in 1908) and Henry Ford's vow to &quot;build a car for the great multitude.&quot; It picks up speed in the '20s with the birth of the U.S. highway and cruises to our current national love affair with SUVs, &quot;two-ton behemoths that swill fuel like hogs at the trough.&quot;<br />The automobiles themselves will be treat enough for car nuts. For the rest of us there is Lewis's affection for Americana. She shoots a '35 Ford pickup, black with red-rimmed wheels, against the bleakness of Two Guns, Ariz.; a ruby red '59 Cadillac Eldorado convertible in the glitter gulch of Fremont Street in Vegas; and a muscle-car legend, the '64 Pontiac GTO, beneath a towering doughnut sign in L.A.<br />A great gift for car loving guys &amp; gals on Valentine's Day or any day.

What if Freud's groundbreaking case study \\"Dora\\" did not crack the case of female hysteria being caused solely by sexual repression? What if not psychoanalysis but another of our modern secular religions, criminology, was brought to bear on the mystery of Dora?  Interesting fodder and Shield's pulls off the switch with impressive &eacute;lan.<br />While &quot;The Fig Eater&quot; is satisfying as a nuts-and-bolts story of detective work in early 20th century Vienna, the novel also leaves us with the haunting sense that we can approach the truth only by opening our minds to more than one way of knowing.<br />As the novel opens, Dora has been murdered. In sinuous, disciplined prose, Shields relates the painstaking efforts of one Inspector (whose name we never learn) to piece together the circumstances of the girl's death. He follows the exacting principles outlined in the 1901 &quot;Enzyclop&auml;die der Kriminalistik,&quot; the first psychological approach to crime. The novel includes many excerpts from this remarkable work, which is as much a philosophical tract -- a guide to living a fully conscious life -- as it is a handbook on criminology.<br />The Inspector's Hungarian wife, Ersz&eacute;bet, finds herself moved, for reasons she doesn't fully understand, by the pathos of Dora's murder. She decides to investigate on her own, with the help of a game young English nanny she has befriended. Ersz&eacute;bet has her own methodology, derived from the Gypsy folklore she grew up with: She focuses on dreams, spells, the weather, animals -- in short, everything her husband's rationalist training overlooks.<br />The novel abounds with sensual pleasures -- especially the exquisite descriptions of rich Viennese food -- made all the more appealing by the precise, unhurried way Shields illustrates them; she is a visual artist, too, and her eye for the painterly is evident. While the author takes liberties with the historical record, having the girl murdered at 20 feels true to the disturbed-family scenario that led the father of the real-life Dora -- a woman named Ida Bauer, who actually lived to be 63 -- to send her to the great psychoanalyst for treatment. Shields makes the murder seem historically plausible. And that's just the first of the means by which, in &quot;The Fig Eater,&quot; she expands our ways of seeing.<br />A substantial literary view of murder, mayhem, and mind-expansion.thor takes liberties with the historical record, having the girl murdered at 20 feels true to the disturbed-family scenario that led the father of the real-life Dora -- a woman named Ida Bauer, who actually lived to be 63 -- to send her to the great psychoanalyst for treatment.

Le Carre tauntingly dares us to laugh at others and our own foibles. Thusly: &quot;When Andrew Osnard barged into Harry Pendel's shop asking to be measured for a suit,&quot; begins John le Carr&eacute;'s 16th novel, &quot;Pendel was one person. By the time he barged out again Pendel was another.&quot; With that, we're off to the races -- 332 pages of nuanced drama and tragicomic wit from one of the masters of modern storytelling. If anyone thought that le Carr&eacute; was tiring, or still casting around for his role now that the Cold War is supposedly over, &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; will quickly set all and sundry straight. (I'm sinking my teeth into this espionage master's newest release, \\"The Constant Gardener\\", now.)<br />In Tailor, an orphan brought by up his Jewish uncle in London's East End, Harry learned his sewing skills while doing time for arson. He later perfected them as the Pendel in the house of Pendel &amp; Braithwaite Co. Limitada, tailors to royalty, formerly of Savile Row, and now of Panama City. The trouble is, there never was a Braithwaite, or royal appointments, or even Savile Row. Pendel simply has an extraordinary talent -- a &quot;fluence&quot; -- for making things up. &quot;It was improving on people. It was cutting and shaping them until they became understandable members of his internal universe.&quot;<br />The one true thing about Harry is that he is indeed the tailor to Panama's rich and famous. This fact makes him an ideal &quot;joe&quot; for Osnard, a young, amoral operative on the make -- a Nick Leeson of the MI6 -- and for the British secret service, which has persuaded itself that running a covert operation to reassert Western control of the Panama Canal is just the thing to get it back into America's good graces.<br />In &quot;The Tailor of Panama,&quot; le Carr&eacute; writes from the inside out. His characters emerge in all their folly, grandeur and ambivalence. And the author's shrewd ear for the vernacular is worth the price of admission alone. Close to 70, le Carr&eacute; is still, as he remarked a couple of years ago, &quot;fizzing with fiction.&quot; His fans, and English literature, are the better for it.<br />As the author himself once mentioned in an interview; \\"I think the ones [his novels] I want to be buried with are &quot;A Perfect Spy&quot; and this one. I have the most affection for the characters in those stories, and somehow, they came the closest to the bone. And the laughs. It's wonderful to meet one's friends after they've read &quot;The Tailor of Panama&quot; and find them grinning all over their faces for a change, instead of being plunged into depression.\\"<br />A superb satirical espionage thriller.ular is worth the price of admission alone.

Arkady has to assimilate language, customs and even a little Cuban forensicology at a dizzying rate. But the tropical locations of &quot;Havana Bay&quot; reward both the author -- who meets the challenge by grounding the book with precise, credible detail -- and his inexhaustible protagonist.<br />In Havana, a cabal of Cuban police officers wants to prevent Arkady from identifying the body, and, if possible, to prevent him from going home alive. Only one officer, a single mother named Ofelia Osorio, comes to his assistance, and together the two try to get to the heart of an international conspiracy of venal, murderous thugs.<br />Smith has a delicately layered touch with this novel. Along with a love story, he takes the reader along with Arkady on a hairpin-curve tour through the topics of Russo-Cuban relations, Santeria and the local conventions of hustling with the unsentimental deftness of a seasoned guide. Smith, like other Cold War writers, has had some difficulty in the past few years finding the emerging markets for intrigue. His 1992 novel &quot;Red Square&quot; was an interesting but somewhat shallow dive into Moscow's organized crime problem; his novel, &quot;Rose,&quot; was an ambitious piece of historical fiction about the perils of coal mining in England.<br />So while Smith's writing hadn't suffered much, it hadn't excelled, either. Now it has. Enjoy this solicitous, lascivious, at times, sleek-sleaze ride.	2000-12-17

Raped by her mother's boyfriend at 8 and a mother herself since she graduated from high school, she supported herself and her son, Guy, through a series of careers and buoyed by an implacable ambition to escape what might have been a half-lived, ground-down life of poverty and despair. &quot;For it is hateful to be young, bright, ambitious and poor,&quot; Angelou observes. &quot;The added insult is to be aware of one's poverty.&quot; In &quot;Even the Stars Look Lonesome,&quot; a collection of reflective autobiographical essays, Angelou gives no further explanation for her &quot;profound belief&quot; that she would die young.<br />&quot;I was thirty-six before I realized that I had lived years beyond my deadline and needed to revise my thinking about an early death,&quot; she recalls. &quot;With that realization life waxed sweeter. Old acquaintances became friendships, and new clever acquaintances showed themselves more interesting. Old loves burdened with memories of disappointments and betrayals packed up and left town, leaving no forwarding address, and new loves came calling.&quot;<br />Angelou, looking at tailights of her 20's, is the nearest thing America has to a sacred institution, a high priestess of culture and love in the tradition of such distaff luminaries (all of them, hitherto, white) as Isadora Duncan and Pearl S. Buck, with a bit of Eleanor Roosevelt and Aim&eacute;e Semple MacPherson thrown into the mix.<br />&quot;She was born poor and powerless in a land where/power is money and money is adored,&quot; the poet Angelou writes in tribute to another astonishing black woman of our time, Oprah Winfrey. &quot;Born black in a land where might is white/and white is adored./Born female in a land where decisions are masculine/and masculinity controls.&quot; Angelou's lifelong effort to escape and expose the &quot;national, racial and historical hallucinations&quot; that have burdened black women in America and replace them with a shining exemplar of power, achievement and generosity of spirit is as miraculous as she says it is, even if one suspects that in &quot;real life&quot; Angelou must be a little hard to take.<br />&quot;I would have my ears filled with the world's music,&quot; she writes, &quot;the grunts of hewers of wood, the cackle of old folks sitting in the last sunlight and the whir of busy bees in the early morning ... All sounds of life and living, death and dying are welcome to my ears.&quot; At times Angelou seems more like a blast from Olympus than a woman of flesh and blood.<br />Reading these essays, I found myself longing somewhat guiltily for evidence of smallness on her part, of pettiness, even -- some sign that even an icon as monumental as she is might occasionally allow herself an irritated moment, a lapse into cynicism, or humor that wasn't so resolutely seasoned and wise.<br />On the other hand, smallness isn't what Maya Angelou stands for. Ordinary is not what she does. Only a cynic, a smaller mind than Angelou's, could fail to welcome the gifts she offers.escape and expose the &quot;national, racial and historical hallucinations&quot; that have burdened black women in America and replace them with a shining exemplar of power, achievement and generosity of spirit is as miraculous as she says it is, even if one suspects that in &quot;real life&quot; Angelou must be a little hard to take. <br />&quot;I would have my ears filled with the world's music,&quot; she writes, &quot;the grunts of hewers of wood, the cackle of old folks sitting in the last sunlight and the whir of busy bees in the early morning ...

Alas, even the memoir and bio freak in me, does enjoy romance. So, I ask you, what makes Alice Hoffman's fiction so consistently compelling? Is it her story lines, reminiscent of Harlequin romances but with occasionally peppery dashes of cultural savviness? Or is it her characters, Anne Tyler-esque in their oddities, but without the irony? Or perhaps it's that quasi-New Age voice, lulling you into a Marianne Williamson world where one's fate is left to the movements of the sun, the moon, the planets or just some unnamed Higher Being?<br />Hoffman's fans won't be disappointed by the airy-fairy &quot;Here on Earth,&quot; which weaves all of Hoffman's usual themes into a dreamy, intricate family melodrama, complete with alcoholism, wife-beating, obsessional love and whiffs of murder. It's the story of March Murray, who returns to her ancestral home at Fox Hill in New England after spending decades away in &quot;lemon-colored&quot; Palo Alto. In tow is her difficult teenage daughter Gwen, who is described as &quot;pretty ... in spite of all her sabotage.&quot; At issue is a death in the family, but we know that March is really back to face her old ghosts, this time in the form of her adopted brother Hollis, whom she has been obsessively thinking about ever since his disappearance 20 years earlier.<br />Confused? Don't be. &quot;Here on Earth,&quot; despite its convoluted plot threads and histories, is at heart a romance novel with a bite. As with a good made-for-TV movie, you can pretty much guess what will happen to poor old March, whose naivet&eacute; is at best frustrating and at worst unlikable. Nor is it any surprise that Hollis -- with his black, snapping eyes, and whose exits are followed by a blast of cold wind -- reveals himself to be Evil Incarnate: Subtlety is not one of Hoffman's strong points.<br />Still, this novel's comfy, confident voice is enough to lure you into an armchair for the better part of an evening. Hoffman's world is a place where emotions become aromas: Longing is &quot;the scent of grass on her pillow&quot;; anger is a &quot;scorching scent&quot;; mourning is &quot;the scent of roses sweet and ripe and sorrowful.&quot; Moons peep out behind trees, fox-colored dogs herald the advent of evil and dreams are to be courted and followed.<br />\\"Here On Earth\\" is a literary romance with teeth.

This tantalizing biography by Francine du Plessix Gray deftly guides us through a most twisted mind and details the idyllic estate in Provence where he created some of his most shocking work.<br />The Marquis de Sade, who was born in 1740 and died in 1814, was a passionate gourmet, and especially loved baked apples and vanilla custards for dessert. He also fancied Provençal delicacies such as quail stuffed with grape leaves, very fresh cream of chard soups and chocolate cake. &quot;I wish for a chocolate cake so dense,&quot; he once wrote his wife from one of his stints in jail, &quot;that it is black, like the devil's a** is blackened by smoke.&quot;<br />Sade, one of the few men in history whose names have spawned adjectives, was equally particular about matters of personal hygiene and liked to bathe every day -- a habit totally foreign to his 18th century contemporaries, who might have bathed twice a month at the most. He loved dogs, he loved children as long as they abided by his orders and he delighted in family games such as blind man's buff and musical chairs.<br />But above all other material things, above all his many whimsies and caprices, the Marquis de Sade cherished a certain place in his native Provence, a little château in a small village called La Coste, which he had inherited from his father's family and on which he looked as his only home. La Coste was to Sade what Walden was to Henry David Thoreau, what Combray was to Marcel Proust, what Amherst was to Emily Dickinson -- the matrix of all inspiration and perhaps also of all delusions, the quintessential Site-as-Muse.<br />There's a potential danger in this kind of domestic approach to the Marquis de Sade. Such domestic ironies, such pleasant trivia of Sade's life as his love of baked apples might defang him, and turn this borderline psychopath and woman-batterer into a pleasant fellow. It should not be forgotten that one of the most terrifying features of Sade's persona, as with many batterers of women, is the vast range of his behavior -- his occasional capacity for great tenderness and integrity, his considerably more frequent manipulativeness and brazen authoritarianism. Sade was a power freak if there ever was one.<br />With detailed imagery, blueprints if you will, of La Coste; secret apartments, torturous rooms of enema bags, photo galleries rampant with pornography, Gray is an architect of an intriguing, well researched biography of a most disturbed, yet scintillating man.pleasant fellow.

For Heller, the author of the bitterly funny &quot;Catch-22&quot; and several other less winsome novels, has filled the pages of this somewhat disorderly memoir with a collection of remembrances that have no more logic to them than a dream.<br />Still, Heller is Heller, and even the most jumbled segments of this generally affable memoir have their share of insightful observations and amusing asides. Heller's memories of his Coney Island childhood are laced with sardonic humor and bathed in a warm glow of nostalgia. He tells of his first (and last) ride on the Cyclone at Luna Park (as a returning Air Force airman with 60 missions under his belt); of street games of &quot;punchball&quot; (a sort of stickball without the stick); of swims out to the bell buoy at Coney Island Beach -- which he only now recognizes were exceedingly dangerous ventures.<br />Most of this memoir deals with Heller's childhood, his stint in the Air Force and his years as a young adult. Aside from relating his early struggles to get into print (one of which involved a story called &quot;Did You Ever Fall In Love With a Midget Weighing Thirty-eight Pounds?&quot;), Heller provides few insights into his career as a writer.<br />But the crumbs he gives are intriguing enough. He notes that over the years his memories of wartime incidents have gotten so intermingled with his fictional versions of them he can't always tell them apart. But there are some things he'll never forget. Like most writers, Heller is unable to forgive a bad review, including one rather unkindly review of &quot;Catch-22&quot; from the New Yorker, which declared that the novel didn't &quot;even seem to have been written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper.&quot; Heller restrains himself from gloating over the book's triumph over its early critics, but, as he notes with blunt honesty, &quot;What restrains me is the knowledge that the lashings still smart, even after so many years, and if I ever pretend to be a good sport about them, I am only pretending.&quot;<br />An eclectically myriad view of and by the author of Catch-22.ather unkindly review of &quot;Catch-22&quot; from the New Yorker, which declared that the novel didn't &quot;even seem to have been written; instead, it gives the impression of having been shouted onto paper.&quot; Heller restrains himself from gloating over the book's triumph over its early critics, but, as he notes with blunt honesty, &quot;What restrains me is the knowledge that the lashings still smart, even after so many years, and if I ever pretend to be a good sport about them, I am only pretending.&quot; <br />An eclectically myriad view of and by the author of Catch-22.	2000-12-11

Everest Disaster	Books	5	2	3	N	N	A Towering Memoir of Everest	Reporter Jon Krakauer took an assignment from Outside magazine to write a piece on the guided expeditions up Mount Everest being offered by experienced climbers. A climber himself (albeit one with no high-altitude experience), who had long dreamed of scaling Everest, Krakauer joined a tour led by the New Zealand climber Rob Hall. He made it to the summit only minutes before an unexpected blizzard struck the mountain. Hall's wasn't the only group on Everest, and before the storm was over, he and nine other climbers had died.<br />&quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; an expansion of the 17,000-word piece Krakauer wound up writing for Outside, is Krakauer's first-person account. It is also the realization of a man who has gone as far as he could in pursuit of a habit that almost killed him.<br />Krakauer says that writer friends urged him to get some perspective on the experience before writing this book. He couldn't, he said, because it &quot;was gnawing my guts out.&quot; Though &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; came less than a year after that trip, it didn't weaken Krakauer's reporting skills. He's scrupulously fair and honest about his co-climbers and guides. He records acts of selfishness and foolishness as well as acts of bravery, sometimes all from the same person.<br />Mr. Krakauer writes indelibly, agonizingly, on the physical torment of existing, let alone exerting yourself, at high altitude. He's brilliant on the particular brand of masochistic asceticism that drives mountain climbers. He doesn't take the easy position that only experienced climbers should be allowed on Everest; he knows that anyone has to be slightly crazy to attempt it.<br />Describing a hike he took to accustom himself to the higher climate, he writes, &quot;There, at the head of the Cwm [pronounced koom] ... I came upon (a) body in the snow, or more accurately the lower half of a body. The style of the clothing and the vintage leather boots suggested that ... the corpse has lain on the mountain for at least ten or fifteen years ... the shock ... wore off almost immediately... It was as if there were an unspoken agreement ... none of us dared acknowledge what was at stake here.&quot;<br />It's the highest praise I can give &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; that Krakauer has faced without self-protection what, finally, was at stake. His story contains what must be one of the essences of hell: the unceasing potential for things to become worse than you fear.<br />Staying up half the night to finish &quot;Into the Air,&quot; I spent the other half trying to push it out of my mind. I don't even want to think about what Jon Krakauer sees when he closes his eyes.t least ten or fifteen years ... the shock ... wore off almost immediately...

First, Mrs. Reilly trips over a rug and breaks her leg, ruining a planned family trip to Hawaii. Then, while she is recovering in the hospital, Mr. Reilly and his spunky chauffeur Rosita are kidnapped and held for $1 million ransom.

But to understand your own brutal, beautiful country as well as Edna O'Brien understands hers must be a bigger curse by far. There's no way a blessed person could have written a novel as shimmering, as ruthless and as devastating as &quot;Down by the River&quot;: it's evidence of something more than mere talent, or even genius, at work. O'Brien's gifts are magnificent and terrifying, along the lines of stigmata and clairvoyance -- the kind of gifts that mark you.<br />Inspired by a case in Ireland, in which a 14-year-old rape victim was forbidden by the courts to leave the country to obtain an abortion, &quot;Down by the River&quot; is the story of Mary MacNamara. After being raped by her father, Mary conceives his child. A sympathetic neighbor brings her to England for an abortion, but the authorities haul them back, cowing them with their ugly threats. Mary refuses to name the baby's father, and her case becomes a cause that turns her own friends and neighbors against her. She's seen as both a villain and an object of sanctimonious condescension in the Catholic community.<br />That community's cruelty is the bitter, driving force of the book -- but it's Mary's suffering and loneliness that are at the heart of it. After a street musician befriends her (he lets her stay at his flat for a few days and buys her a cheap sweater), she writes him a letter: &quot;I nearly died when you gave me that jumper. You shouldn't have. Turquoise is my favorite color. There are two kinds of alone, there's the kind which you are and the kind which I am. Your alone is beautiful, it's rich.&quot; It's a passage that takes you apart, the way a teenager's breathless enthusiasm is crushed by the young woman's overwhelming sense of fear and isolation.<br />O'Brien never takes the easy way out: not even Mary's father is painted as a monster. She describes how he helps birth a colt -- reaching into the mare's womb and coaxing it out by both brute strength and force of will, saving the mother's life in the process -- with such grace and tenderness that even against your will, you feel yourself almost, almost, growing to understand him.<br />But O'Brien doesn't hold back when it comes to her wrath at the Catholic Church, and at the small-minded Irish who slavishly follow it at the expense of their own humanity. O'Brien has lived in London for more than 20 years -- she isn't welcome in her own country, for obvious reasons -- and yet Ireland will never leave her. Her stories work on us exactly the way her homeland has worked on her. They can stare you down and tear you apart like a wolf -- and then, miraculously and tenderly, bring you back to life again, stronger and better than before.  With &quot;Down by the River,&quot; O'Brien marks us as well: it's the kind of book that takes days, maybe weeks, to shake.ute strength and force of will, saving the mother's life in the process -- with such grace and tenderness that even against your will, you feel yourself almost, almost, growing to understand him. <br />But O'Brien doesn't hold back when it comes to her wrath at the Catholic Church, and at the small-minded Irish who slavishly follow it at the expense of their own humanity.

It's built on Sobel's translation (the first into English) of 124 letters written to Galileo Galilei, the Renaissance Italian philosopher, mathematician and physicist, by his illegitimate daughter Virginia. Galileo's letters to her have not survived; they are presumed to have been destroyed by the nuns at her convent. But Sobel, author of the 1995 bestseller &quot;Longitude,&quot; showing once again her keen eye for the compelling stories that simmer beneath great discoveries, turns this seemingly meager material into genuine historical drama.<br />That Galileo even had a daughter may come as a surprise to many readers. And indeed, he never married. But in an affair with Marina Gamba of Venice he fathered a son, Vincenzio, and two daughters, Virginia and Livia. The daughters were considered unfit for marriage because of their illegitimacy and were placed in convents. Virginia, the eldest, took vows as Sister Maria Celeste, a name she chose in part out of respect for her father's infatuation with the stars.  Sobel intersperses factual descriptions of the scientist's life and work with passages from Maria Celeste's letters. As the social burdens he bore as a heretic and outcast increased, so did his bodily afflictions; Maria Celeste's concern for these chronic infirmities -- gout, hernia and ocular infections, among other ailments -- runs as a leitmotif through her letters.<br />She conveys also a timeless caution against the dangers of forest-for-the-trees myopia. As she tells a story about how difficult it was for many people to accept the Earth's place in the solar system, she suggests a simple explanation for why people so often fail to understand their own place in the world: &quot;As participants in the Earth's activity, people cannot observe their own rotation, which is so deeply embedded in terrestrial existence as to have become insensible.&quot;<br />&quot;Galileo's Daughter&quot; makes us pause and consider other aspects of our existence of which we may be insensible, and that we should perhaps regard with slightly less certainty.makes us pause and consider other aspects of our existence of which we may be insensible, and that we should perhaps regard with slightly less certainty.	2000-12-09

He is a satanic cartoon, the nightmare we cannot awake from and the clich&eacute; we erect against the void he made. He is the black hole in the middle of our blasted century, a figure so weighted down with the allegorical trappings of Evil that his reality seems ungraspable. Adolf Hitler stands at the limit of so many kinds of human understanding -- moral, political, psychological, perhaps even metaphysical -- that he is forever escaping into the gilded glare of the absolute, like the hideous negative of one of those inscrutable saints in Byzantine portraits.<br />&quot;These people must not know where I come from,&quot; Hitler said when he learned of an early investigation into his murky origins. &quot;Nobody must know who I am.&quot;<br />For half a century, historians have been trying to learn who he was -- and there is still no consensus. In &quot;Explaining Hitler,&quot; Ron Rosenbaum tries to approach him indirectly, by interrogating the ways that other scholars and journalists have tried to explain Hitler. He hopes to discover, he says, &quot;if not the truth about Hitler, then some truths about what we talk about when we talk about Hitler. What it tells us about Hitler, what it tells us about ourselves.&quot;<br />Agree or disagree, few contemporary writers are better equipped to pull off this tricky double task. Rosenbaum, who writes a column of sui generis criticism for the New York Observer and teaches literary journalism at Columbia University, is a rare triple threat: He is a first-rate thinker, a fine reporter and a superb writer. Explaining Hitler gave me inner glimpses into myself. As I have often wondered--why does he fascinate me so?<br />A somewhat slanted, yet striking view of, whom some refer to as the artist of death.	2000-12-08

The themes that had shaped her own early life -- abandonment, disillusionment, trauma -- were writ large on this tiny island, and Gimbel set out to understand what had happened: how historical context, both personal and political, could so inform us.<br />She tells this story through three women whose lives span the 20th century on the island: Naty Revuelta, born in 1925, a wealthy, restless socialite during the Batista era, who became Castro's lover just before his ascension to power; Naty's mother, an unrepentant reactionary named Do&ntilde;a Nacita, who lives almost entirely in the past; and Naty's daughter, Alina, who is Castro's illegitimate, unacknowledged child.<br />In Gimbel's hands, their lives become an intimate historical document, one that illuminates the intersection between a woman's internal and external worlds. I found the authoress to be  a graceful and precise writer, so carefully evoking the particulars of their lives, and so deftly interweaving their tale with the larger story of Cuba's social and political transformation, that what emerges instead is a rich and varied portrait, one that remains true to its mission.<br />It is, as the book's subtitle suggests, a story of Cuba; it is also an achingly human tale about false promises, the blinding power of passion, the life-altering failures of family.imate historical document, one that illuminates the intersection between a woman's internal and external worlds.

What's bizarre is that none of them seems to have provoked a flicker of indignation in the author.<br />For example, when Herman considers McCarthy's vicious attack on Gen. George Marshall in 1951, he refuses to take the senator's words at anything other than face value. &quot;If Marshall were merely stupid,&quot; McCarthy lashed out, &quot;the laws of probability would have dictated that at least some of his decisions would have served this country's interest. ... We have declined so precipitously in relation to the Soviet Union in the last six years, how much swifter may be our fall into disaster with Marshall's policies continuing to guide us?&quot;<br />Ignoring the obvious implications of McCarthy's statement, Herman complains, &quot;Critics bandied it about that McCarthy had called Marshall a traitor (he had not), a secret Communist (he had not), and even a coward.&quot; Is Herman incredibly literal or just naive?<br />It's certainly useful to try to understand, from the senator's point of view, why McCarthy did what he did. But at times Herman simply takes leave of his own judgment. And some of the excuses he offers for McCarthy's conduct are astounding. McCarthy &quot;decided to lump where others took care to split,&quot; Herman shrugs. Oh, was that it?<br />Despite its flaws, Herman's book is fascinating, and it visits a lot of interesting territory: McCarthy's friendship with the Kennedys, his strong political support among Catholic voters, the tactical mistakes that led to his eventual downfall. And Herman makes a strong argument that the grounds on which the Senate censured McCarthy were tenuous at best. But even then, Herman takes his own argument one step too far. He compares McCarthy to the victims of Stalin's show trials, who, after their convictions for nonexistent crimes, were hauled off and executed.<br />All of this makes for great political debate fodder.ere hauled off and executed. <br />All of this makes for great political debate fodder.	2000-12-04

That's not a new idea, of course. Get any group of people 35 or older reminiscing, and the topic will eventually be chewed over till everyone sounds like Dana Carvey's Cranky Old Man on Saturday Night Live....<br />'Why, we remember the days when you had to actually go into a bank and see a teller to get cash, when nobody had a fax machine, when we had to keep from playing our favorite tunes too often because, as every audiophile knew, the grooves on the LP needed time to rest; and, dammit, we liked it that way!'<br />Employing a knowing, tongue-in-cheek style and, yes, a suitably fast pace, Gleick examines every time-related dimension of life in what he calls this &quot;epoch of the nanosecond.&quot; He observes that &quot;a compression of time characterizes the life of the century now closing,&quot; and he proceeds to peg our obsession with correct time, our frustration with things that go too fast or too slow, the evolution of the concept of speed, the pervasive influence of the computer and the effect of the culture of acceleration on the arts.<br />His most resonant chapter heading is &quot;The Paradox of Efficiency.&quot; Gleick uses the phrase to describe the complicated systems that businesses use in order to become vastly more efficient (and less likely to bend to your whim). Missed your connecting flight? Thanks to modern flight planning programs that keep far fewer &quot;extra&quot; planes on hand, you stand a good chance of waiting longer than ever for another one.<br />But the paradox of efficiency doesn't apply to customer service alone. The nemesis of the &quot;just in time&quot; inventory systems that have made auto production much more efficient is that little spare parts factory in Ohio that, each time it suffers a strike, shutters every GM plant in the Midwest.<br />Closer to home, this paradox is the creepy certainty that the more you have the resources to work with every day -- the more words you can process, the more e-mails and faxes you can send and instantly answer -- the more expectations of your output expand. You can now do more, so you can't do enough.<br />One day the Internet is a marvelous new tool; the next afternoon you're drumming your fingers during transfer time, despairing that it takes 15 seconds to have an entire library catalog a continent away at your fingertips. With the rise of time consciousness has come, Gleick notes, the rising status of the overbooked. Think of all the exaggerators you know who with straight faces claim 80-hour work weeks. Why revel so in the notion of overwork? For many people today, having time on your hands feels downright dirty. What kind of a slacker are you? &quot;The transformation of time into a negative status good has odd social consequences,&quot; Gleick writes, and he quotes Michael Lewis on the &quot;wonderful new prestige [of] any new time-saving device. After all, who needs such a device? People who have no time. And who has the least time? The best people!&quot;<br />There is a benefit to reading about acceleration beyond the fact that this book is consistently witty and fine: &quot;Faster&quot; makes you consider your own role in accepting the acceleration of modern life.

But as John, Paul, George and Ringo tell it in this long-awaited group recollection, their view was decidedly different. &quot;It was crazy,&quot; says George Harrison, describing the height of Beatlemania. &quot;Not within the band. In the band we were normal. The rest of the world was crazy.&quot;<br />That unique perspective -- along with more than 1,000 snapshots, handwritten notes and business letters -- gives this epic volume its considerable charm. Even Beatle experts will enjoy the fresh anecdotes uncovered in interviews with the three surviving band members. (Lennon's contribution is cobbled together from various interviews.) However, their alternating recollections don't always get to the emotional heart of their experience -- which only makes Lennon's demise the more poignant.<br />For while the interviews he gave prior to his 1980 death are refreshingly frank, we're left wondering how the most unvarnished of the Beatles would have seen it so many years later.<br />A magical history tour for devotees and naivaetes alike.	2000-12-04

Thurman won a 1983 National Book Award for &quot;Isak Dinesen: The Life of a Storyteller.&quot; A gifted literary biographer, as sure-handed as her subject, she never conflates the life with the work or allows her admiration to interfere with an informed and delicately balanced critique of Colette's uniqueness.<br />&quot;Like all those who never use their strength to the limit,&quot; Colette once wrote, &quot;I am hostile to those who let life burn them out.&quot; Fiercely disciplined, hugely productive, the author of &quot;Gigi&quot; and &quot;Ch&eacute;ri&quot; lived 80 years and produced nearly 80 volumes of fiction, memoirs, journalism and drama.<br />She married three times, had male and female lovers and for a time supported herself as a mime, dancing semi-nude in music halls throughout France. When she died in 1954, she received the first state funeral the French Republic had ever given a woman.<br />Colette is a strikingly elusive writer. Packing her books with delicious clothes and furniture and ravishingly attractive people, she delivers pleasures that most &quot;women's writers&quot; only promise. But her prose is rarely straightforward or transparent, and her characters -- captured at the height of their beauty or in beauty's humiliating decline -- maintain a mocking, self-protective reticence.<br />Colette, Thurman says, was &quot;remarkable among modern writers -- perhaps the great women in particular -- for a sense of self not vested in her mind.&quot; Maybe female writers have simply had to think harder in order to carve out space within ideologies that would otherwise have shut them out.<br />She drew inspiration from entertainers, courtesans, an aristocratic Parisian lesbian subculture and the fin de si&egrave;cle gay aesthetes whose &quot;fetish worship of human beauty&quot; she shared. She admired the bravery of lives lived on the sexual edge, the consciously chosen tastes and prejudices, the risk of physical danger. Her understanding of gender was far ahead of its time; her treatment of sex between generations can still make us uneasy.<br />Courting dissatisfaction in love, Colette's characters nonetheless do so within one of the most satisfactory physical worlds ever depicted (who under the pseudonym Pauline R&eacute;age wrote &quot;Story of O&quot;) remarked that Colette never neglects to describe her heroines' meals or the comforts, grand or shabby, of their bedrooms and bathrooms.

It's not for want of trying. More than 100 biographies have attempted to make sense of the Nazi leader -- not counting Hitler's own unreliable autobiography, &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; -- and new ones are still hitting the shelves.<br />As historian John Lukacs observes in his often suggestive &quot;The Hitler of History,&quot; we have not yet come to the crest of the &quot;Hitler Wave&quot; that German historians first noticed building nearly three decades ago.<br />Despite Hitler's inescapable presence in our popular consciousness, he remains difficult to pin down. We know everything about him -- except what it all means. In &quot;The Hitler of History,&quot; Lukacs attempts to make some sense of the debate. His book is not, as he hastens to point out, &quot;a biography of Hitler, but a history of his history, and a history of his biographers.&quot;<br />In a series of provocative chapters, Lukacs examines a number of key questions surrounding the Nazi leader: Exactly when and where did his ideology first crystallize? Was he a reactionary or a revolutionary? An ideologue or an opportunist? A beloved leader or a despot? Lukacs navigates this difficult historiographical terrain with considerable skill -- though, it must be admitted, he's much better at asking questions than answering them. (Suffice to say that his tentative answers to the above questions resist easy summary.)<br />Still, there are times when even those who agree with Lukacs will find themselves frustrated by this contentious book. Lukacs dismisses the work of certain historians with an impressively Olympian disdain -- and though many of his targets deserve this sort of dismissal (one thinks especially of the inexplicably popular Nazi-friendly historian David Irving), Lukacs would have done better to engage their arguments in more detail.<br />Unfortunately, when Lukacs does get into specifics, he tends to fall into a sort of debate-club pedantry, blasting away at minutiae in rambling footnotes that at times threaten to overwhelm the text itself. And there are curious omissions: Though Lukacs devotes a chapter to the question of Hitler's popularity with the German people, he manages to avoid discussing the often-vitriolic debate over Daniel Goldhagen's book, &quot;Hitler's Willing Executioners,&quot; which (as its title suggests) argued that there were more than a few &quot;good Germans&quot; willing and able to carry out the dirty work of the Holocaust.<br />It's a pity Lukacs does not weigh in on this particular debate, for the question of ordinary German &quot;willingness&quot; to follow Hitler, as Lukacs himself acknowledges, is absolutely central to our understanding of the Holocaust itself. Hitler, as Lukacs reluctantly acknowledges, &quot;may have been the most popular revolutionary leader in the history of the modern world ... He is not properly comparable to a Caesar, a Cromwell, a Napoleon. Utterly different from them, he was, more than any of them, able to energize the majority of a great people, in his lifetime the most educated in the world, convincing them to follow his leadership ... and making them believe that what they (and he) stood for was an antithesis of evil.&quot;<br />We need to understand not just the &quot;banality&quot; but the strange respectability of Hitler's evil if we are to keep what happened in Germany from ever happening again.f debate-club pedantry, blasting away at minutiae in rambling footnotes that at times threaten to overwhelm the text itself.

Perhaps a forgotten, 1,200-page canvass of history found propping up a broken bedstead at the great man's dacha? Is the mystic count of Russian literature about to have a go -- &agrave; la Louisa May Alcott -- at the late-20th century bestseller lists, thanks to a misplaced manuscript? Not quite. Tolstoy's &quot;new&quot; book, &quot;A Calendar of Wisdom,&quot; has gone though the printing presses in Cyrillic several times, but has now been translated into English by Peter Sekirin.<br />&quot;A Calendar of Wisdom&quot; is a collection of quotations culled from world literature and grouped thematically for each day of the year. It is, in Tolstoy's words, &quot;an accumulation of the cultural heritage of our ancestors, the best thinkers in the world.&quot;<br />This book is, by design, popular reading from a great master; it was made, in his words, &quot;to present for a wide reading audience an easily accessible, everyday circle of reading which will arouse their best thoughts and feelings.&quot;  And, as a book of daily inspiration, it is probably the best of the lot. Whose life wouldn't be bettered by a daily nibble of Shakespeare, Lao Tsu, Ruskin, the Talmud, the Dhammapada, Socrates, Jefferson and a host of small and tall 18th and 19th century thinkers?<br />Tolstoy's sentiments are truly affecting, simple but not easy prescriptions for daily living. But keep in mind that it was not enough for the count himself, who died -- barely two years after the publication of the last edition of the calendar -- at a lonely train station as he attempted to flee the bonds of his gentrified life.<br />In these readings life serves up some measures of grief as well as comfort food. It is in fact, Tolstoy's vision. I think of this calendar as Tolstoy's spiritual Rolodex; a kind of truth one can live and prosper with.	2000-12-04

After all, its predecessor, 1995's dazzling &quot;The Liars' Club&quot;, an account of her hardscrabble Texas childhood, virtually jump-started the latest memoir craze. Happily, &quot;Cherry&quot; delivers. Karr still has her delicious knack for making you guffaw through horrible events, but this volume, which focuses on her adolescence in the late '60s and early '70s, is decidedly sunnier than its predecessor.<br />There are vivid evocations of young desire -- at one vulnerable moment, her whole body starts to hum like a &quot;locust singing inside its husk&quot; -- and memorable characters. The rememberances begin to get hazy and drag a bit as Karr becomes increasingly drug-addled in her teen years. Is &quot;Cherry&quot; as good as &quot;The Liars' Club&quot;? Not quite, but its humor, warmth and crackling language should keep Karr's fans hungering for another round.	2000-12-02

The 182 page ''Rabbit Remembered'' tries to work both sides of the street, to document the dying months of the '90s while conjuring the spirit of a hopeless narcissist.<br />Forty years ago, ''Rabbit, Run'' introduced Harry ''Rabbit'' Angstrom, the rangy, aimless middle American who'd go on to star in three further novels. Harry died in 1990's ''Rabbit at Rest,'' and ''Rabbit Remembered,'' a tail to the tale, looks at what was left in his wake.<br />A doorbell hoarsely rings in Brewer, Pa., and Janice Harrison, Harry's remarried widow, is staring across her doorstep at a somewhat sluttish looking nurse named Annabelle Byer, the product of an affair Rabbit had way back when. In his typically crystalline prose, Updike describes how Janice sizes up the girl and her motives and how she mulls over lost time while scooting about town in her black LeBaron convertible.<br />Janice's ex- cokehead son, Nelson, is now a 42 year old mental health counselor divorced from his wife and living at home. He takes a shine to his half sister that's both fraternal and not a little incestuous. Nothing much happens, but by the holidays, fragments of families are meeting up and falling apart and piecing themselves -- and thus Rabbit -- together again.<br />Throughout, people take in the noise of the age: impeachment, ''American Beauty,'' the Y2K bug, the new VW bug.... And Updike seems particularly hung up on tongue studs.<br />There are a dozen short stories in ''Licks of Love'' too; most are not just short but small, and they're all pointed in the same direction as the main event anyway -- toward past books and ancient desires. With his keen looks at (un)settling old scores, Updike has designed the glimmering ''Rabbit Remembered'' as a seductive news brief. It's a ghost story, to be sure, but each character is haunted by the present, and American life is all American gothic. It turns out that poor Harry Angstrom, a monument to the way our little lives are led, was a man in full after all.t that poor Harry Angstrom, a monument to the way our little lives are led, was a man in full after all.	2000-11-28

In beneficent books like ''The Bean Trees,'' ''Pigs in Heaven,'' and ''Animal Dreams,'' she creates vivid domestic utopias, usually influenced by the wild landscapes of rural Appalachia or sun bleached Arizona, where she declares herself pro organic gardening and antiwar, in favor of good sex and against rudeness.<br />In the beckoning kingdom of Kingsolver, thinking women (sexy even with their middle aged bodies and stubborn ways), responsive men (sexy even when impermanent), and free range children (handfuls but always worth it) can live in harmony, breathe clean air, and listen to National Public Radio. She offers a balm, a seductive glimpse of an abundant Eden near at hand for even the least spectacular, least perfect, least wrinkle free of readers.<br />After the exciting, rewarding leap she took with the bestselling ''Poisonwood Bible,'' away from home canning and deep into the lives of an American missionary family in the Belgian Congo of the 1960s, the new novel is a return to Kingsolver's ''classic'' style and subject matter. We're back in fertile southern Appalachia, in Zebulon County, in a season so glorious with dappled things as to leap right out of a Gerard Manley Hopkins poem. And up and down the valley, women and coyotes are sniffing the air.<br />Literally. In the mountains, pheromones fly when Deanna, a solitary wildlife biologist who champions nature's predators for their underappreciated contribution to ecological balance (she's divorced, not yet 50), meets a much younger man, a hunter, while each is tracking the elusive coyote, canis latrans. In the hollow, Lusa, a young farmer's widow (a splashy multicultural mix, half Palestinian and half Polish Jewish, not yet 30) unknots the tangles of distrust that separate her from her late husband's firmly rooted kin. Across the county, Nannie, an old nonconformist lady (not yet 80, her orchard pesticide free), bickers with the fusty old widower next door.<br />It will come as no surprise to her acolytes that Kingsolver eventually twines all three of these admirable specimens of feminine self actualization, and that coyotes are seen and heard regularly. Blended and otherwise do it yourself postnuclear family groupings have always enchanted Kingsolver, as has the interconnectedness of humans and the rest of the natural world.<br />The mating habits of a luna moth, the marvelous secrets revealed in animal droppings, and the best thing to do when surprised by a deadly copperhead snake equally inspire her, and the writer's prose sings sweetest when she's closely observing the earth with no thought to making poetry. Of an oak tree upended by a storm, she notices, ''the fallen tree still burgeoned with glossy oak leaves -- probably still trying to scatter its pollen to the wind and set acorns as if its roots were not straggling in the breeze and its bulk doomed to firewood.''<br />But then, goodness gracious, Lusa has deep thoughts like, ''We're only what we are: a woman cycling with the moon, and a tribe of men trying to have sex with the sky.'' And Kingsolver herself has palpitations over Deanna's intense erotic response to her young lover/ hunter. (''She could not remember a more compelling combination of features on any man she'd ever seen.'') When they go to bed for the first time, ''It was the body's decision, a body with no more choice of its natural history than an orchid has, or the bee it needs, and so they would both get lost here, she would let him in, anywhere he wanted to go.''<br />Cue the birds, the bees, the coyote's wail, and pour yourself a mug of mint tea--a luscious literary view of women.r next door. <br />It will come as no surprise to her acolytes that Kingsolver eventually twines all three of these admirable specimens of feminine self actualization, and that coyotes are seen and heard regularly.

Lenin endorsed it as &quot;a truthful and most vivid exposition of the events so significant to the comprehension of what really is the Proletarian Revolution.&quot;<br />Already based in Europe and sympathetic to the cause of the Russian Revolution, Reed was able to observe dispassionately exactly what was going on and to find out not only what the Bolshevik leaders were doing, but to move among those on the streets and note experiences of the masses of ordinary people.  Witnessing first-hand the day-to-day events of the Revolution, he captures in vivid and graphic detail the atmosphere of that time.<br />An extraordinary document of history in the making, this newer edition is the first with contemporary photographs, while a new introduction by Harold Shukman, University Lecturer in Modern Russian History at Oxford University, sets the work in context.  Published to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the Russian Revolution, this illustrated edition will appeal to anyone interested in modern history. And quite possibly re-ignite a political polemic.<br />Warren Beatty dared to make the film Reds, which gives us a poignantly epic visual view of John Reed, his life, his loves and his fierce beliefs as read in Ten Days That Shook The World.	2000-11-27

This Booker Award Winner (named for the voting by British bookies)was an odds on favorite to be exactly that--a winner.<br />Events open with the present day autobiography of Laura's older sister, Iris: The sharp witted widow recalls growing up in a repressive family of wealthy Toronto industrialists -- and how dreamy Laura developed a forbidden interest in a scruffily attractive union leader.<br />Entwined with this saga are marvelous excerpts of Laura's posthumously published novel-- an erotic cult classic called ''The Blind Assassin,'' detailing the illicit affair between an unnamed strike organizer and an heiress, during which the man relates a clever, bedtime sci-fi yarn about a blind assassin who falls for a mute sacrificial virgin.<br />Atwood performs a spectacular literary sleight of hand, fashioning a bewitching, brilliantly layered story of how people see only what they wish to -- and how terrible the consequences of not voicing the truth can be.	2000-11-27

This dark European best-seller is about prostitution and decadence-not of the body but of the intellect and soul. It's fiction about Nazi Germany.

Geli, a lively, witty young woman, was no Nazi and had been restive under Hitler's increasingly domineering obsession with her.<br />After her death, ruled a suicide, he said she had been the only woman he would ever love. Was there a sexual relationship? Was Geli actually murdered because the affair, if made public, would have derailed his rise to power? In Hitler's Niece, a fact-based novel, Hansen's attempt to solve the mystery approaches melodrama. But the incidental detail accumulates into a brilliant, chilling account of the way psychological deformity and historical chance propelled Hitler and his confederates toward triumph.	2000-11-27

David Guterson's first novel, set on an island in Puget Sound, Wash., in the 1950s, got good reviews and eventually won several awards, including the 1995 PEN/Faulkner. But it was also a classic word-of-mouth sleeper, talked into paperback-best-seller heaven by hundreds of thousands of ardent readers.<br />Guterson's new novel, East of the Mountains, is set in the orchard country of central Washington, but in essential matters it has a lot in common with its snowy predecessor. It has Guterson's subtle, elegiac style, infused with atmospheric landscapes and high seriousness.<br />It's a story of precarious redemption, a man backing through defeat into grace. And it's haunted by memory, both sweet and rueful. The period doing the haunting is the same one--World War II and the years just before it. Taken together, Guterson's two Pacific Northwest novels, like Cormac McCarthy's &quot;Border&quot; trilogy about the Southwest during the 1930s and '40s, reflect a deep nostalgia for the Depression and the war as the last austere and heroic time in American life, before the culture became plastic and ironic, consumerized and televised.<br />In fact, East of the Mountains, set in 1997 amid standard roadside clutter and blight, gives a better sense of our diminished present. But avid Guterson readers may feel that the enchantment gauge is down somewhat from Snow Falling on Cedars, which evoked a distinct world through its story of a Japanese-American man brought to trial on a murder charge, interspersed with memories of a clandestine interracial love affair and stark images of snow and sea.<br />East of the Mountains is an episodic and brooding road (and off-the-road) novel, in which the episodes are usually compelling but have a cooked-up feel. Most road novels have young heroes. This one has a 73-year-old retired Seattle heart surgeon named Ben Givens, who grew up on an apple farm near the Columbia River. He acutely misses his wife, Rachel, dead for 19 months, and now he's been diagnosed with terminal colon cancer.<br />Already in pain, he decides to commit suicide, planning to make it look like a hunting accident to spare the feelings of his daughter and grandchildren. With his two dogs and shotgun he drives east over the mountains in search of a canyon to disappear into. And everything goes wrong. If Guterson were a comic writer--which he definitely isn't, particularly when he momentarily tries to be--this would be a comedy of errors about a man who wants to kick the bucket but keeps putting his foot into it.<br />Crossing a mountain pass, Ben skids off the wet road, wrecking his car and leaving himself with a breathtakingly ugly black eye. He gets a ride to a nearby town from a young couple, neo-hippie vagabonds who supply him with pumpkin seeds and Tibetan incense.<br />Carless, he decides to hike to the desert to hunt birds and himself, but after a memorably nightmarish scene involving a coyote, a pack of hounds, and a mystery man on a dirt bike, he's left gunless and nearly dogless as well. During his misadventures he meets a hitchhiker offering marijuana, itinerant Mexicans in need of a doctor, and a girl who imparts the cloudy wisdom of the German spiritualist Rudolf Steiner (who once figured in a novel by Saul Bellow). Eventually Ben discovers that &quot;all guns are cursed,&quot; and that by saving the lives of others he saves his own for an honorable end.<br />There's a lot in the book that's unflinching, especially Ben's ordeals on the Italian front during the war. But the prevailing note here, as in Snow Falling on Cedars, is tenderness; Guterson is a master, for instance, at depicting first love. The tenderness in this book occasionally crosses the border into sentimentality. Too many characters are too good to be true--the Mexicans are all humble and saintly, for instance, and Rachel seems remote in Ben's devout memories of her. But Ben is deeply drawn and complexly sympathetic, and if his story, compared with Guterson's first novel, occasionally seems forced and thin aroun the edges, it's sustained by the same consistent intelligence and moral vision.seems remote in Ben's devout memories of her.

From 1990 to 1996 he was a research fellow at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he now directs the Science and Human Dimension Project. He is a regular contributor to the Sunday Times of London, and to many religious affairs publications around the world. He is a practicing Roman Catholic and author of five non-fiction books.<br />In this scathing view by Cornwell , the author draws upon the very conclusions reasoning why,  Eugenio Pacelli, Pope Pius XII, has long been the subject of controversy over his failure to speak out against Hitler's Final Solution.<br />In Hitler's Pope, John Cornwell shows that, even well before the Holocaust, Pope Pius XII was instrumental in negotiating an accord that helped the Nazis rise to unhindered power--and sealed the fate of the Jews in Europe.<br />Drawing upon secret Vatican and Jesuit archives to which he had exclusive access, Cornwell tells the full, tragic story of how narcissism, longstanding personal antipathy for the Jews, and political and spiritual ambition combined to make Pius the most dangerous churchman in history. A firm and final indictment of Pius XII's papacy, (according to the author) Hitler's Pope is also a searing exploration of its lingering consequences for the Catholic church today.<br />A valued read for needed, sometimes heated discussions.	2000-11-25

May asks the opposite question: How was it that Hitler and his generals managed this swift conquest, considering that France and its allies were superior in every measurable dimension and considering the Germans' own skepticism about their chances?<br />Strange Victory is a riveting narrative of those six crucial weeks in the spring of 1940, weaving together the decisions made by the high commands with the welter of confused responses from exhausted and ill-informed, or ill-advised, officers in the field.<br />Why did Hitler want to turn against France at just this moment, and why were his poor judgment and inadequate intelligence about the Allies nonetheless correct? Why didn't France take the offensive when it might have led to victory? What explains France's failure to detect and respond to Germany's attack plan? One will have to decide on their own answers. It is May's contention that in the future, nations might suffer strange defeats of their own if they do not learn from their predecessors' mistakes in judgment.<br />Thoroughly researched, Ernest May writes a dramatic narrative-and reinterpretation-of Germany's six-week campaign that swept the Wehrmacht to Paris in spring 1940. Besides his point of view to be read and pondered, several intriguing pictures and maps are included.	2000-11-25

Spoto, who has made a reputation with biographies of Alfred Hitchcock and Laurence Olivier, is nonetheless not averse to speculation when the information simply does not exist, as when he writes,&quot;Whether Jackie returned from Europe as a virgo intacta may never be known: On this matter, she kept her counsel.&quot;<br />While Spoto admits that Jackie and JFK &quot;took to the grave the details of their private moments,&quot; he does tell us she called the President &quot;Bunny&quot; as a rib on his insatiable sexual appetite. Such tidbits keep a reader engaged.	2000-11-24

Hard to believe, but we have eclipsed the 20th anniversary of The World According to Garp, a novel nearly everybody read, reread, talked about, and foisted on friends. John Irving's slapstick tragedy about a famous writer and his bizarro extended family achieved the kind of cultural and psychic penetration that happens nowadays only with celebrity trials, Washington sex scandals, and $200 million disaster movies.<br />But success on that grand a scale comes at a price, and while Irving has continued to produce good books, his career over the past two decades has often seemed like a manic attempt to top Garp. If novels like The Cider House Rules and A Prayer for Owen Meany have at times resembled his masterpiece in sheer energy, they've never matched it in scope, psychology, or wit.<br />Now, in A Widow for One Year, he's returned to the world of Garp--the world of writers--to imagine the life and times of Ruth Cole, &quot;a well-respected literary novelist and an internationally best-selling author.&quot; More restrained than his fiction of recent years, and as heartfelt as anything he's done, Widow stands as one of Irving's best novels and a worthy thematic sequel to his most famous creation.<br />We first meet Ruth in the summer of 1958, when she's 4. Her father, Ted, a lazy but successful writer and illustrator of children's books, spends most of his time seducing miserably unhappy Long Island housewives. Ruth's mother, Marion, at 39 still &quot;one of the most beautiful women alive,&quot; passes her solitary days at home studying the framed snapshots of her two dead sons that cover nearly every inch of wall space. (As teenagers, Thomas and Timothy Cole died in a car crash.)<br />Consumed by grief and emotionally distant from her young daughter (&quot;...if I let myself love Ruth...what will I do if something happens to her?&quot;), Marion decides to abandon her family. Before she does, though, a 16-year-old prep school boy named Eddie O'Hare arrives from New Hampshire to work as Ted's assistant. Smitten with (okay, aroused by) his employer's wife, Eddie is amazed--as many readers might be as well--when Marion starts taking him to bed. Day after day. Sixty times, by Eddie's count.<br />At summer's end, Marion simply disappears, and it's that one selfish (or maybe selfless) act of abandonment that determines the path her lover and daughter eventually follow. They grow up to become writers, Eddie doggedly penning younger man/older woman autobiographical novels and Ruth, with more acclaim, writing novels about the repercussions of making choices.<br />Except for Kurt Vonnegut, there's probably not another major living American writer whose eccentricities are as flagrant, or as indelibly fixed, as those of John Irving. In novel after novel, here as in Garp, parents fail, lust is perilous, accidents happen, and &quot;the grief over lost children never dies.&quot; And, here as in Garp, characters--no matter how old they grow--never quite shake off the awkwardness, innocence, or unflagging self-absorption of adolescence.<br />A combination of vaudeville, romance, and sentimentality, A Widow for One Year is never entirely convincing, but like a warm bath, it's a great pleasure to immerse yourself in.ampshire to work as Ted's assistant.

He had gotten Sara fired, was being set up for murdering his brother and had just told off the Chief Justice of the United States. All in less than an hour.&quot;<br />For ex-cop-turned-public-defender John Fiske, the hero of this thriller from David Baldacci (Absolute Power, The Winner), the predicaments pile up quickly, especially when Fiske runs into a cover-up in Washington's highest echelons.<br />Fiske's brother Michael, a Supreme Court clerk, had come across the petition of inmate Rufus Harms, who claimed he was wrongly convicted of murder on an Army base 25 years earlier. Soon the body count rises -- Michael, a second clerk, Harms's lawyer -- and Rufus busts out of the joint.<br />With the help of his romantic interest, court clerk Sara Evans, Fiske tries to unravel the conspiracy. Baldacci ratchets up the suspense, but he lays on the stereotypes pretty thick (the good guys are tough but tormented, the women pretty and smart, and Rufus is the noblest of causes). The simple truth, in the end, proves anything but.<br />Another lively legal thriller by Baldacci.	2000-11-21

And talk. His books are long, sometimes lacivious conversations, and his characters distinguish themselves -- sometimes extinguishing themselves to the reader-- through their own words.<br />For instance, in The Golden Age, a large helping of World War II era spilled beans, a young man at a New York party responds to the idea that America needs a new civilization to go with its new global ascendancy by saying, ''Do we really want a civilization?... We've done awfully well as the hayseeds of the Western world. Why spoil it?... No, we've got to stay dumb.''<br />Yes, that signature cynicism is uttered by the author himself, making a brief cameo. So if you won't find gore, you will find Gore in this 100 percent action free wartime novel, the seventh and last in the linked sequence of American history novels that begins chronologically with ''Burr'' (although Vidal wrote what's now volume 6, ''Washington, D.C.,'' way back in 1967) and adds up to a talkative masterpiece.<br />Also in captivity, among a mob of mid century American potentates, are Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Herbert Hoover, Cary Grant, and Tennessee Williams.<br />As usual, the conversation's good. Vidal's animated historical figures aren't farcically pompous, but they are, like Vidal himself, trenchant, sporadically wise, and routinely malicious. He delivers verbal stilettos to just about every eminent back that appears.<br />The more ominous conversations are about America's backing into the war and its lurching role in the postwar world. If you've been following the story through previous novels like ''Empire'' and ''Hollywood,'' you know the anti imperialist gospel according to Gore.<br />Here, Vidal's FDR sees involvement in the Nazi launched European war as a winnable shot at an American administered worldwide New Deal, and -- craftily and charmingly -- he goes for it mainly (in what has been the novel's most controversial assertion) by provoking the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor. The global war produces, in Vidal's version, a new America that loses its republican innocence and becomes a Cold War garrison state.<br />In other words, we should have stayed dumb, or played dumb. One of Vidal's mostly marginal fictional characters, wandering in from the earlier novels, launches a magazine and declares, ''I intend to create... America's Golden Age.'' For Vidal, it was that brief parenthesis of national elation, between war and Cold War, that was a Golden Age, followed by fool's gold -- we're now stuck in a congested ''technological Calcutta'' of a planet.<br />Wherever you shelve its populist isolationist politics, ''The Golden Age'' works as a mordant evocation of historical personalities and turning points, and above all, as monumental past tense gossip.y -- he goes for it mainly (in what has been the novel's most controversial assertion) by provoking the Japanese into attacking Pearl Harbor.

In so doing she brought attention to both her magnificent voice and the reality of segregation in the capital.<br />This absorbing authorized biography puts Anderson's career before her skin color, but Brandeis University music professor Keiler, who interviewed the singer shortly before her death in 1993 at age 96, carefully documents both her musical evolution and civic triumphs.<br />Though clearly awed by the stately vocalist who dressed in white satin, Keiler celebrates the humanitarian who served as a U.N. delegate, funded scholarships for black youth (both Jessye Norman and Leontyne Price auditioned for one but lost), mastered works by Brahms, Schubert and Sibelius and became the first African-American to sing at the Metropolitan Opera.<br />An important read of a voice which sang so true.	2000-11-20

Absorbing, too, is the detailed treatment of the social and cultural scene in 1960s and '70s London.<br />The author treats his subject reverentially, sometimes dismissing Moon's destructive, manipulative and often thuggish behavior -- he broke his wife's nose three times -- in favor of extended passages analyzing his talent, which Fletcher calls &quot;unique yet impenetrable.&quot;<br />Fletcher interviewed over 100 people in researching the book. A slight flaw, the testimony of outspoken bandmates Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend, two indispensable voices, is mysteriously missing.<br />This recount of Moon's rise and fall casts a riveting glow.	2000-11-20

Booze, pills, bitchy rivalries -- it's all here in this bloated but fun read by celebrity biographer Taraborrelli.<br />Based on interviews (though not with the wives) and previously published material on the Kennedys, the author -- dishy tone aside -- provides surprisingly three-dimensional portraits of queenly Jackie, sharp-tongued Ethel, sensitive alcoholic Joan and their complex relationships with one another. (Ethel's jealous sniping at Jackie is a hoot.)<br />While the book upholds old rumors, such as Ethel's affair with singer Andy Williams, it leaves a question mark surrounding alleged flings between Jackie and Bobby and Bobby and Marilyn Monroe. (The book was completed, of course, well before a family imbroglio -- the Jan. 19 arrest of Ethel's nephew Michael Skakel, 39, who is charged with the 1975 murder of his 15-year-old Greenwich, Conn., neighbor Martha Moxley.)<br />Though none of the cheating Kennedy men was any bargain as a husband, it's Joan -- if the long list of Teddy's cruelties here is to be believed -- who got the rawest deal. After she campaigned for his Senate re-election in 1964 as he recuperated from a plane crash, Teddy's way of saying thanks was to head directly from the hospital into the arms of a mistress.<br />Ah, politicians and their wives, do indeed make for strange bedfellows and fun dishy reading.	2000-11-20

What's a woman to do? If you're real estate agent Patty Anne Murphy, narrator of Elizabeth Berg's (Talk Before Sleep) latest novel, you beg, plead and somehow convince your gay best friend to play daddy.<br />A tough premise for any writer to pull off, but Berg is up to the challenge. Patty lives in the small town of Crystal Cove, Mass., and remains close to her parents, who seem to have the very life that eludes her: a happy marriage and loving family.<br />Having grown weary of the dating circuit, Patty convinces herself and soulmate Ethan Allen Gaines to give parenthood a shot. Together. After all, Ethan, who has also struck out trying to find a partner, shares Patty's desire to raise a child, even if he doesn't return her feelings for him. Predictably, there's plenty of head-scratching when Patty announces that not only is she pregnant with Ethan's baby but they also plan to move to Minnesota for a fresh start.<br />Described with great humor, Berg's Patty is endearing and real. Though the story of a woman's race against the biological clock has been told many times before, Berg renders her version with subtlety and insight. For example, Patty's unabashedly romantic feelings for a fundamentally uninterested man at first seem outlandish, but in Berg's telling they become a compelling hook. Readers can't help but root for Patty and her unconventional solution.	2000-11-19

That is, if the situations in the latest collection of blisteringly funny pieces (28 in all) by the 43-year-old rapscallion David Sedaris were not so hillariously exaggerated.<br />A sun-worshipping sister is lampooned for being &quot;tanorexic,&quot; and he lists his mom's hobbies as smoking, napping and reading the works of kitsch-maestro Sidney Sheldon. Then there is Sedaris p&eacute;re, a former IBM engineer, who, says the son, hoards food so obsessively that his closet still contains expired six-packs of Sego, the chalky chocolate diet drink of the 1960s.<br />And what are we to make of the claim that in the author's childhood North Carolina household there was an unending turnover of pets, all afflicted with a failure to thrive?

But you won't much miss them in this modest but irresistible tale from actress (Goodfellas) and novelist (The Girls) Elaine Kagan.<br />When 25-year-old actress Chassi Jennings, daughter of a venerable film producer, throws a tantrum on a set, the studio calls a time-out and sends her into therapy. Her psychiatrist Eleanor Costello eventually determines that Chassi's histrionics are a cover for deeper issues, such as the trauma of witnessing her movie-legend mom's death in a hit-and-run accident 14 years earlier.<br />In the process, &quot;La Shrink&quot; (as Chassi calls Dr. Costello) gains insight into her own troubled relationship with her daughter. Still, as neurotic, drug-addled Hollywood brats go -- remember the Meryl Streep character in Postcards from the Edge? -- Chassi is a Girl Scout.<br />Not to worry, though. Kagan keeps this mother-daughter drama bubbling along with smart dialogue and alluring details of Chassi's casually posh life -- from her perfect golden hair to her new black BMW, the Holmby Hills mansion and finally the breathless, latte-serving actors-in-training who want to walk in her shoes. You'll be mentally casting this role -- Gwyneth? Cameron? Jennifer? -- long before you put the book down.<br />A delicious Hollywood read sans the Jackie Collins hype.	2000-11-19

The title is the first inkling of the idiosyncratic style of the Antigua-born author, who stakes her Garden prose with parentheses the way she might prop up a row of French Marmande tomatoes. In this case, happily, the yield is no less luscious.<br />Although the book kicks off with a listless piece about wisteria (what was that all about?), persistent readers will be rewarded with smart-mouth observations on useless horticultural tools (she calls a trap for garden varmints a &quot;ridiculous pantywaist contraption&quot;) and highhanded seed sellers. Sprinkled among these observations are intriguing autobiographical tidbits about Kincaid.<br />The author only hints at what life is like for this particular black woman living in the mostly white state of Vermont.

But in this novel the post-hurricane landscape is littered with &quot;broken trees and utility poles, heaps of lumber and twisted metal,&quot; to say nothing of &quot;a typewriter and a tangle of golf clubs and a cedar hot tub, split in half like a coconut husk.&quot; No surprise, then, that the tempest has also shaken loose a platoon of the author's wackiest characters.<br />Chief among them is Skink, the one-eyed former governor who appeared in two previous Hiaasen books. Energized by the storm (which he spends tied to a bridge), Skink emerges from the Everglades to kidnap one of Dade County's more offensive tourists, a honeymooning New York ad exec.<br />Nearby, a nasty ex-con has joined forces with a gorgeous con artist in a plot to steal somebody else's home insurance. (This is not, to her credit, Edie Marsh's first choice for making money. She has spent the last six months in Palm Beach trying to sleep with a Kennedy.)<br />It says a lot about Hiaasen's view of humanity that his most likable character is a guy with the &quot;perhaps unwholesomely exhilarating&quot; hobby of juggling human skulls. By book's end, our hero will add to his collection--but not before Hiaasen drags in a runaway bride, some storm-addled monkeys and a roof inspector who has never been known to climb a ladder.<br />The author, a Miami Herald columnist whose book, Striptease, was made into a movie starring Demi Moore and Burt Reynolds, provides his characteristic incongruously happy ending. Despite Hiaasen's crusading tone (a Florida native, he sees evil lurking in the heart of every developer) and deadpan style (&quot;The death of Tony Torres did not go unnoticed by homicide detectives, crucifixions being rare even in Miami&quot;), there's something gently romantic about his writing.<br />Raucous, scathing but never mean-spirited, Stormy Weather goes a long way toward securing Hiaasen's place as America's premier satirist.	2000-11-16

Out of costume one evening, the deranged Dilbeck comes to the defense of a Fort Lauderdale stripper, jumps onstage to throttle one of the joint's customers. Before long the congressman is the subject of a blackmail plot.<br />Hiaasen, who in his previous novels Tourist Season and Native Tongue applied his vicious wit to those who contaminate the natural beauty of his state, here pounces on politicians. Dilbeck owes his job to the sugar industry, but thanks to his little weakness (''I should never be around naked women''), he also retains a swarm of political fixers -- most notably, Malcolm B. (Moldy) Moldowsky, who keeps a portrait of the ''severely maligned'' former Attorney General John Mitchell in his front hall.<br />Hiaasen's unlikely heroes include stripper Erin Grant, who is desperate to wrest custody of her daughter from her ex-con ex-husband, and a bald, lumbering bouncer named Shad. (When not protecting the dancers at the Eager Beaver bar, Shad imbeds roaches in containers of yogurt -- always hoping for that one big lawsuit score.) Joining detective Al Garcia, a guy who just wants to finish one fishing trip without catching a corpse, the two manage to bring down Dilbeck's monied network.<br />Rough, raucous and filled with lovable losers, Strip Tease is a caper novel for readers not afraid to laugh out loud.	2000-11-16

It could be the work of a ghost. It is, in fact, the work of 17-year-old Henry, the story's sardonic, trying-to-be-detached narrator, who inadvertently learns of the relationship between &quot;Liza38&quot; and &quot;Rpoll&quot;, e-mail monikers for his pianist mother, Elizabeth, and fellow musician Richard Polloco. <br />Henry's obsession with this liaison is paralleled by his 13-year-old sister Elvira's fanaticism about the Civil War. Elvira dresses only in period costume and shows up at battle reenactments outfitted as a boy. <br />This is a perfect paradigm for Disobedience, which is all about loyalties and disguises, and is also, at bottom, a provocative story of a family divided against itself.	2000-11-14

A map of the route to someone's house? Click. A rundown of someone's previous addresses and spending habits? Click, click. A boy can even find out about his mother's extramarital affair, as Henry Shaw does in this wonderfully haunting fourth novel from Ms. Hamilton.<br />Reading someone else's e-mail is a quiet, clean enterprise: no smudge of ink, no greasy thumbprint left behind. It could be the work of a ghost. It is, in fact, the work of 17-year-old Henry, the story's sardonic, trying-to-be-detached narrator, who inadvertently learns of the relationship between &quot;Liza38&quot; and &quot;Rpoll&quot;, e-mail monikers for his pianist mother, Elizabeth, and fellow musician Richard Polloco.<br />Henry's obsession with this liaison is paralleled by his 13-year-old sister Elvira's fanaticism about the Civil War. Elvira dresses only in period costume and shows up at battle reenactments outfitted as a boy.<br />This is a perfect paradigm for Disobedience, which is all about loyalties and disguises, and is also, at bottom, a provocative story of a family divided against itself.	2000-11-14

Having already demonstrated the pleasure of watching three middle-aged divorc&eacute;es wreak vengeance on their slimeball exes, &quot;First Wives Club&quot; author Goldsmith now turns her delightfully wry eye on three more youthful brides, each wrestling with her own attempt at happily-ever-after.<br />Half-Italian, half-Jewish lawyer Angela Rachel Goldfarb Romazzano Wakefield is celebrating the first anniversary of her marriage to a dashing Boston WASP. Michelle Russo is a perky blonde homemaker who married her childhood sweetheart and adores her kids and her plush suburban lifestyle. Bank manager Jada Jacksonhas three children and a hunk she describes as DDG (drop-dead gorgeous).<br />But one by one, each of the women's love boats springs a leak. Disillusioned with lying, scheming and cheating by their mates, the girlfriends band together to find themselves, their dignity and a little bit of justice along the way.<br />Yes, the plot is awfully similar to the author's other tale of wronged wives getting even. And naturally a film version of Young Wives is already in the works. But with irresistibly likable heroines limned by Goldsmith's laugh-out-loud prose, you won't mind a second showing.	2000-11-13

By turns fearful, vain and hostile, MacLaine makes her eccentricity endearing, even if you scoff at how the spirit moves her.	2000-11-13

John Munch on NBC's Homicide: Life on the Street, comedian-actor Richard Belzer can often be heard spouting the sardonic cop's paranoid theories about government cover-ups and domestic espionage.<br />Yet who ever thought Belzer himself was such a die-hard conspiracy nut? Or is he just putting us all on? In the first half of his mystifying UFOs, JFK and Elvis (in which the late Mr. Presley, incidentally, gets only a brief mention), Belzer gleefully trashes the 1964 Warren Commission report on JFK's assassination. But Belzer embraces so many alternate explanations that we're left to conclude that a veritable army of assassins from CIA agents to Mafia hit men murdered the President.<br />When he moves on to UFOs, Belzer's approach is slightly more antic. (&quot;The universe is really big,&quot; he says, making the case for extraterrestrials. &quot;It's even bigger than Wal-Mart.&quot;) Was the 1969 lunar landing merely a huge special-effects hoax? Or did Neil Armstrong spot UFOs on the moon, which NASA then covered up? In sum, Belzer's amusing cockeyed thesis seems to be: Have it your way--just don't believe anything the government tells you.<br />A tongue-in-cheeky read.	2000-11-12

Luckily for fans of Angela's Ashes,his 1997 Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, McCourt's genius for observation survived the trip.<br />Resuming where his No. 1 bestselling remembrance of an Irish boyhood concludes, 'Tis follows McCourt from his first American job-emptying ashtrays at the Biltmore Hotel-through his years on Manhattan's loading docks, his stint in the Army, his days at New York University and his entry into the profession he practiced for 30 years: teaching high school English.<br />Moving from near-starvation in childhood to grown-up literary renown is an astonishing trajectory; McCourt recalls it with wry humility. When his first students, at a vocational high school, declare the book Giants in the Earth irrelevant (&quot;all these Europe people all gloomy on the prairie&quot;), McCourt digs up autobiographical papers by students from years past to engage his class. &quot;Without the crumbling compositions,&quot; he writes, &quot;I might have had to teach.&quot; As he has proved once again, telling your own story well can do just that.	2000-11-12

But once upon a time, back in the '50s, pop singer Eddie Fisher was a true superstar, though hardly &quot;bigger than the Beatles,&quot; as the crooner boasts. His downfall, as they say in self-helpese, was that he preferred playing musical beds to making music.<br />In Been There(written with David Fisher, no relation), the singer chronicles his sexcapades with a jaw-dropping conga line of conquests that included Ann-Margret, Marlene Dietrich, Michelle Phillips and JFK mistress Judith Exner. The only one Fisher trashes is ex-wife Reynolds, whom he calls a &quot;self-centered, totally driven, insecure, untruthful phony.&quot;<br />What's both surprising and charming here is that for a showbiz guy who was hooked on amphetamines (for 37 years) and m&eacute;nages &aacute; trois, Fisher emerges as remarkably unjaded, still the sweet innocent from Philly. It's almost as if Pat Boone had stumbled into Frank Sinatra's life by accident.	2000-11-12

But that would be missing the point. Clymer, a veteran New York Times correspondent, does present a detailed account of the 1969 Martha's Vineyard accident that left Mary Jo Kopechne dead.<br />And the book includes key lowlights such as Kennedy's expulsion from Harvard for cheating and the night in 1991 when he rousted two young nephews out of bed for a night of drinking that led to rape charges against one of them, William Kennedy Smith (who was later acquitted).<br />What is remarkable is that despite these foibles and his family's tragedies, Kennedy has emerged as one of the era's most effective lawmakers, a champion of causes such as health care and civil rights.<br />Though Clymer occasionally gets bogged down in minutiae, he nevertheless gives us a readable and worthy account of a flawed and fascinating politician.	2000-11-10

Clearly, Sylvia's Restaurant in Harlem, along with her Atlanta branch and her line of soul food products, is serious business.<br />But hers is also an inspiring American success story, as hard work (and a healthy dash of hot sauce) propels Woods from rural poverty to celebrity-chef status. Woods tells the story of her extended and close-knit family and shares such fiery recipes as her Chopped Barbecued Pork and Herbert's &quot;Hot As You Like It&quot; Fried Corn, perfected by her husband of 55 years.<br />Even if you are not hungry--this cookbook fills your soul.	2000-11-08

But after three broken engagements, the heroine of this breezy new tale from Ms.Howard (All the Queen's Men) has given up on finding Mr. Perfect. When Jaine and three pals engage in some risqu&eacute; girl talk about what they want in a man, their tongue-in-cheek list gets leaked to the local newscast. Soon, they're being pursued by the national press -- and one particularly offended, and psychotic, killer.<br />Jaine takes refuge with her next-door neighbor Sam Donovan, a hunky cop who, as Howard pantingly describes, measures up on all counts. Their white-hot affair takes up so much of the book that finding the murderer seems almost an afterthought. Sam's police work cracks the case, but by the inevitable showdown, it's clear that Jaine is one woman who doesn't need rescuing.<br />A quick sassy read.	2000-11-08

But Sheehy, drawing on interviews with hundreds of subjects -- some of whom have kept silent until now -- breaks new ground in addressing the big question: Do the Clintons love one another -- or is it just a political partnership?<br />Her answer: Hillary is addicted to Bill. &quot;He is her only rebellion,&quot; writes Sheehy, &quot;the one thing she can't logically explain.&quot; The author charts the dog days of the Clintons' relationship, when, in the late '80s, Bill fell in love with a blonde Arkansas divorc&eacute;e and Hillary contemplated divorce. Sheehy also explores Hillary's character -- her toughness, her ambition, her willingness to blame her husband's problems on others -- without suggesting these qualities are less appealing in a woman than in a man.<br />A woman of addictions and ambitions and an interesting read.	2000-11-08

Clarke's masterly biography draws on extensive interviews and Garland's unpublished memoirs to recount a life as woeful as Job's. With an overbearing mother who hooked young Judy on pills, and a studio (MGM) that mercilessly assaulted her self-image and privacy -- even as she captured the public's adoration as Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz -- Garland never developed personal responsibility or sound judgment.<br />That led to sexual libertinism, hopeless affairs with married men (Tyrone Power, Orson Welles) and bad marriages (two of her five spouses were gay, including director Vincente Minnelli; her fourth, Mark Herron, had an affair with Peter Allen, daughter Liza's first husband). Clarke unflinchingly details Garland's mood swings, from desperately needy to monstrously selfish.<br />Yet her resilience was astonishing: triumphant comebacks in A Star Is Born (quickly ruined by bad editing) and in concerts during the '50s and '60s at the London Palladium and Carnegie Hall. Her final years -- estranged from her children, financially strapped, overdosing on pills -- approach great tragedy. Even knowing how it ends, one can't look away.<br />Sad, yes, but we can all learn from Ms. Garland's unsettled yet fascinating life.	2000-11-07

Debra Ginsberg got her education in restaurants, and she doles it out just right in this entertaining account. In 20 years of taking orders for everything from popovers to pi&ntilde;a coladas, she gathered a trove of stories she justly terms &quot;passionate, absurd and intimately human.&quot;<br />Between shifts Ginsberg provides us with endearing glimpses of her large and colorful family -- as a waiter, her dad supported his wife and five kids on tips alone. There are also sporadic helpings of her checkered love life.<br />But Ginsberg recalls her romantic failures with nary a hint of bitterness, including the one with the ex-waiter who fathered her son. Best of all is the inside look at staff romances and the truth about whether a server or cook, if pushed too far by a customer, will spit -- or worse -- in your soup.

A swooning tribute to Hollywood's leading lotharios, its profiles are light on insight, serving merely as an excuse to print some appealing archival pictures. In modern times, Thomas laments, the Latin Lover has been slowly emasculated by the &quot;gorgonlike gaze&quot; of feminists, leaving just one amigo to fill his well-stitched boots: Banderas. &quot;He is at once leather and lace,&quot; she writes, &quot;merging uninhibited animal beauty with a teasing finesse.&quot; That's enough to make any guy want to hide behind a mask.<br />Great pictures, sexy reading, buy one and invite the gals over to dish &amp; drool.

Camille, lonely and depressed, looks after the big cats at the zoo and fantasizes about relationships with sexually and emotionally abusive men.<br />Juxtaposed with the contemporary stories of Ellen and Camille is the gothic tale of Elisabeth Boyer, the Catwoman, a Creole beauty in antebellum New Orleans who was hanged for murdering her sadistic husband.<br />Martin fuses these stories of betrayal into a compelling narrative about human nature, passion and animal instinct, evoking the New Orleans of both centuries with equal clarity.<br />Imaginative and profound, The Great Divorce is a great read that tackles important issues without sentimentality. Despite the inherent sadness and futility that Ellen, Camille and Elisabeth confront, the novel offers a note of hope.

He insists this book isn't a memoir but an account of the &quot;humorous, talented and incompetent people who occupy the entertainment industry.&quot;<br />Havens's tales of the people he met in New York City during the 1960s -- Bob Dylan, James Earl Jones (who also contributes a generous foreword), Joan Baez, Lou Gossett Jr. and others -- are full of nostalgic appeal. Such grace notes from Havens the historian, however, get overwhelmed by his penchant for pontificating -- on the environment, drug use, child-rearing, world peace, you name it. He grows wearisome fast. Warning: Havens takes astrology very seriously. He dismisses his absentmindedness as &quot;an Aquarian trait&quot; and describes a former business manager as a &quot;very nervous type. He also was a Capricorn.&quot; As for John Lennon, the ex-Beatle &quot;had a strong premonition that something was going to happen to him,&quot; reports Havens. &quot;I know I did.&quot;<br />All of which raises one more question: Does Havens, a talented, likable musical performer, have any premonitions about his future in publishing?

And Jemima Jones, heroine of Green's U.S. debut novel, might easily be taken for Bridget's overweight sister.<br />A London journalist, Jemima feels trapped writing a household-tips column for a grubby, down-market London newspaper. And though smart and funny, she weighs nearly 100 lbs. more than she would like to. She secretly adores Ben, her Hugh Grant look alike colleague, but he doesn't see her as girlfriend material.<br />Jemima's life undergoes a seismic shift, however, when she points and clicks her way into an online romance with Brad, a California fitness guru, reinventing herself as J.J., a buff, long-haired TV host, simply by morphing her face onto a fashion model's body and e-mailing the results to Brad. Now all she has to do is starve off 100 lbs. before meeting him.<br />Like Diary, this sparkler from British journalist-turned-novelist Green (who confesses to being a veteran of yo-yo dieting herself) was also a bestseller in the U.K. It conveys with sass and humor both the invisibility of the overweight and the shallow perks that accrue to the thin and beautiful. Green has entertainingly updated the Cinderella story, though Jemima finds that even in the vastness of cyberspace, a charming prince is hard to find.	2000-11-06

She had memorized Mao's Little Red Book, sang heroic operas and was head of her school's Little Red Guard. The year was 1966, and the Cultural Revolution had just begun to turn Chinese society inside out. Too young to understand the public criticisms and purges, Min thought she was fighting for the ''final peace of the planet.'' Then the hardship and terror caught up with her.<br />Red Azalea is her achingly beautiful memoir of the time, a story remarkable for its absence of anger or recrimination against the Communist Party and Chinese government. Told to serve the revolution as a peasant when she turned 17, Min left her family in Shanghai and joined the Advanced Seventh Company to plant rice near the East China Sea, toiling 16-hour days in muddy, leech- filled water. Two years later she returned to Shanghai to compete with three other women for the title role in Red Azalea, a film project based on the revolution, written by Mao's wife.<br />**Min contrasts the gray regimen of her society with her own passions, first for a female lover in the army and later for a mysterious man who supervises the production of Red Azalea. Each secret rendezvous and illicit tryst -- whether in a Shanghai bathhouse or a Buddhist temple brimming with scents of incense, jasmine and the crush of worshippers -- is all the more poignant in a country where personal desires are politically dangerous.<br />Min emigrated to America in 1984, but in Red Azalea she has created a powerful sense of life in China during that country's most heartbreaking time.	2000-11-06

But if you're a high- octane prose addict who takes pleasure in watching an author torquing up everyday life until even the banal has the power to perforate the senses, then, you've found the right book.<br />According to Wright, we live in a culture where too much free time and a gulf between the haves and have-nots is breeding gratuitous acts of cruelty. In this novel we watch how such a state affects a group of well-educated, acquisitive Americans who have nothing to do with one another in any narrative sense.<br />The link between them is a character named Wylie Jones, who suddenly abandons his upper-middle-class life and begins roaming around America, either committing acts of murder or seducing women under different aliases.<br />Going Native, a more elegant way of saying ''reverting to the primitive,'' is a well-chosen showcase for Wright's raw, poetic sensibility. Author of the 1983 novel Meditations in Green, he portrays the effects of violence with hypnotic intensity. An ex-hippie truck driver gets knifed by a hitchhiker, and the blade stuck in his belly pulses to the rhythm of his dying heart. A well- educated woman about to be gunned down at close range in her own kitchen ''could see the terrified mouse that was her mind running round and round, searching for an exit.''<br />Composed of panoramic prose and comically hip dialogue, Going Native has the impact of an X-acto knife slitting open the bloated belly of American life.	2000-11-06

A mystical caddy is there, or is he, to help a golfer find that magical mind place--the zone--when everything is perfect, when you can do no wrong. As Will Smith recently likened it to the first three months of a passionate relationship, walking on air and nothing bothers you.<br />The author draws us into this realm with smooth dialouge and vivid setting descriptions.

And found even my non-veggie teens loved it.<br />I highly recommend this spicy book. Just shopping for the ingredients is an adventure...	2000-11-02

As he travels across the country in deceptive ways, John Corey, who is anything but afraid, tracks this sinister killer with the prowess of a leopard.<br />Just how many lives can wise-cracking Corey save? And more importantly, can he save his own?<br />I thouroughly enjoyed this newest thriller by DeMille. The dialogue popped, the transitions were smooth and a new love interest, Kate, was a sizzler.	2000-11-01

As a Lt. in the service in Nam and a keen human observer--we are given over 700 pages that draw us into a world we Americans sometimes do not like to revisit.<br />The central character, Ben Tyson, is a modern day commuter with a cushy job in NY, a family out in the 'burbs and a sense of honor that is about to be tested to the inth degree. Somone has written a well selling book about the atrocities at Hue. The author's two witnesses have made Ben Tyson culpable for his unit's macabre killing behavior at a French hospital during the war. And now the government plans to make him their scape goat.<br />After 20 years of living with the past, the truth starts to come out. Slowly, in stages, as DeMille builds the tension with episodes between Tyson's wife, his lawyer, his reunion with his men, the author who revealed his secrets, and a cout-martial trial.<br />I always appreciate DeMille's well researched novels. Mixing actual events with fiction using humor and pathos is his baliwick. Characters you want to know and dialogue that snaps.<br />A moving read of war, adventure, and trust.	2000-10-30

Realizing he wrote this back in 1988, Deaver had not yet evolved to such vicious violence as in The Coffin Dancer or The Devils Teardrop.<br />It's a quirky little story with a quirky little female, Rune, in her 20's, purplish hair, a desire for love and fantasy. She begins her biggest adventure when a friendly old man who has rented the same movie from the store she works in, 18 times in a month, is found dead, by Rune. Was it all part of the movie? Was it an accident? Does 1 million dollars really exist from a bank robbery over 50 years ago? And who are these people shooting at her now? I liked the ending, although a bit trite--it left me smiling.<br />A fun piece of mystery fluff.	2000-10-30

All entries are printed in bold caps with brief definitions, parts of speech labels, &amp; various forms of words cross-referenced.<br />I agree with some of the other reviewers on the addition of off color words now being accepted. A sign of our times I guess. Yet, it is fun to peruse &amp; especially easy to handle while travelling.<br />CRWTH? Hmm, a word with no vowels! I came across that one, meaning an ancient stringed musical instrument. A section of other vowel-less words would be nice and maybe Q words that need no U-qat etc. All in all, a good addition to reference collections &amp; keeping a good game fun. In our family we play having to use the word in a sentence!	2000-10-25

And once again I travelled through well worn pages of a classic book in which Ms. Warren draws us in to care for a myriad of characters &amp; plots. This is not just a gay mans book by any means. Through the story of college runners and an older coach with lingering ghosts--we vividly feel everything from friendship, lust, sports adrenalin, homophobic tragedies to a sense of victory of the human spirit.<br />A superb novel which will remain timeless.	2000-10-25

Going back and forth between a diary of sorts and present action. The ending was fulfilling--the journey as twisting as the mountains the novel takes place in.<br />A community of diabolical characters shows Sym, a recently ruined poetess, just how sacred real estate can be. Murders, magic, and mayhem abound. I enjoyed the careful play between Sym and Eva Swank as they attempt to solve the murders on their own.<br />I would have appreciated more on the sexual side and less on the bizarre. But an entertaining read.	2000-10-24

Lexy Hyatt is our central feline. This complex woman has turned to reporting after inner pressures boil over while teaching. And her first criminal assignment hits very close to home indeed.<br />Lesbian sexual scenes are purr-fectly written--leaving us smiling with just a trace of lust in more than our hearts. The mystery of who killed the purple suited woman at the busy lesbian bar, The Cat, almost becomes a non-sequitar whilst the reader becomes deeply attached to people we want to invite over for late night latte's and bold truths.<br />There is the Leather bar, the Billet, the meeting of Wren (who is brought out more in the sequel), soft touches on subjects of parental anguish over gay children, how to overcome deaths of  loved ones...and of course the solving of the murder. Somehow Ms. Miller comforts us with love, lust, meanings of friendship, vivid descriptions of antique fairs, softball games and quiet moments in Florida rains.<br />A tantalizing novel which meanders through one's mind long after the cover is closed &amp; 'til the sequel--Mayhem At The Marina is opened.	2000-10-24

His most profoundly simple thoughts are a most needed &quot;in your face&quot; reality slap. This country is so hung up, on being politically correct, as a kite in a branch ladened tree--we are becoming a society of weeping willows.<br />Elders experiences, truths, and gasping out loud provocations say stand tall, be who you are, and be not afraid.	2000-10-24

Entertwining plot lines pick up from her first novel--The Killing At The Cat and send us off to a wonderfully full community of warm characters at a Florida marina.<br />Descriptive and vivid, we cannot wait to thumb the pages and see what Lexy gets into next. A dysfunctional family murder, holiday fireworks, lust, love, compassion and Lexy's realization of her craving for Wren &amp; settling down in a lesbian relationship which any hetrosexual would yearn for.<br />A flowing read with just enough twists &amp; turns to make us trowel our fingers through our hair &amp; still smile.	2000-10-24

As with any debut novel, I give the authoress her due. Baxter Clare introduces us to the world of Lt. Franko and all that is entailed in her inner city struggle between criminals and police politics in solving a serial rapist case. We are also privy to inner demons of a violently lost lesbian love, a rebirth into a non-conforming society, and an isolation finally thrown off. Almost as if cloaks of darkness removed will allow voids to be filled--like buttery warmed pastries &amp; the playing of &quot;These Foolish Things&quot; ( I prefer Etta James' version ) can fulfill a Sunday morn.<br />An intriguing criminal read with inner glimpses into important issues of lesbianism.	2000-10-24
