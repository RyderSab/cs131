I have over three hundred cookbooks, but Sarah's blow my socks off. They're also some of the ones I use the most, even when cooking for non-vegans. Why?<br /><br />Her books are not only full of the most delicious, mouthwatering recipes ever, but they are also full of cook cooking tips, nifty crafts, pop culture, and humor. This and the two preceding books she did with Tanya Bernard I have read though and through before I ever cooked out of them, just because they're fun! Sarah is also down to earth, and her books aren't preachy like other vegan books. No guilt trips here. Just good food. How good?<br /><br />Wow! Not only is this book full of many yummy general recipes, the deserts in this book are to die for. Yum! Sarah also tells us how to make our own faux meat from scratch, so no more having to buy the pricey stuff from the heath food store. 95% of the ingredients used are simple things every grocery store has, and when something even semi-exotic is used, a common counterpart that can be substituted is named. Most of the recipes make 4 small or 2 large helpings, and can be made in 20-30 minutes. I appreciate this so much!<br /><br />I know that I'm ranting on and on, I just literally can't say enough about Sarah or this book. If you or someone you know is vegan, or even if you want to eat healthier, I can't recommend this book enough! It's just too much fun!	2005-10-06

At the Circus of the Dead, Glyphotech, and The Crawl are easily the best stories, far out stripping the others. Even the average stories in this volume aren't bad, and are worth reading.<br /><br />The stories also cover a broad range of horrors and phobia and this anthology is well worth checking out, whether you're a fan of short stories or of horror in general.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-10-03

Carnor Jax and and Kir Kanos are former members of Palpaltine's Eltite Guard, feared and respected throughout the galaxy. Now, two years after their master's death, they find themselves in very different circumstances. One, Jax, is poised to take over his master's throne, and the other, Kanos is a hunted, hungry fugitive that has sworn revenge on all those who betrayed his beloved emperor.<br /><br />Flashing between now and the past, this book shows us slices of the past, including how the Imperial Guards were trained. Wow! That's all I can say without offering too many spoilers. :> And this book has more twists and turns in this plot than a Kessel Run.<br /><br />Though it's a few years old now, this remains one of the best Star Wars stories of all time, and represents Dark Horse Star Wars at it's best. If what you love about the Star Wars Universe is the characterization then stop reading this review and buy yourself this. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />This can be enjoyed by newcomers and long term fans as it a clearly defined story not relying heavily on intricate continuity.<br /><br />Highly recommended.	2005-10-02

I'm also a huge comic nerd so this seemed like a match made in heaven. Still, there are good things and bad things about this book.<br /><br />Good: Steve Niles is delivers gripping dialogue, always one of his strong suits. The characters are easy to like and identify with, and the villains are creepy enough to make your skin crawl. The art by Nat Jones is like a dark twisted Michael Turner, and the covers by Simon Bisley are included. Bisley! They're beautiful and worth staring at to soak everything in.<br /><br />The Not so Good: The story is so short! 96 pages goes by WAY to quickly, especially for the 14.95 price tag. Also, the story about the serial killing Satanists is definitely Rob Zombie-rific. It's a lot like House of a 1000 Corpses, which I loved, but I also love diversity. If the story had been fleshed out a bit more, stretched maybe another 24 pages, I think it could have been vastly improved- the finished product felt compacted.<br /><br />Over all, I would recommend this book, but go into it knowing that it's not the best graphic novel of the year, but it's still darn good Needless to say, it is mature readers featuring full frontal nudity and gore galore. Hummm. Maybe the gore and nudity should have been included under the `Good' column....	2005-09-25

Gambit: Hath no Fury is the brilliant follow up to Gambit: House of Cards. The scripting is fast paced, the characterization is fierce and the penciling tight. All this technical brilliance sparkles around 3 tales of our favorite Cajun.<br /><br />In Voodoo Economics, reprinting Gambit #7-9, we meet Detective Noreen Takana, a ruthless career driven police officer that get tangled up with our favorite Cajun as he must stop a plague of zombies from ravaging the Big Easy. No problem for an X-Man, right? Wrong. One of the zombies is an invulnerable mutant bent on gaining revenge for his wrongful death and another zombie with direct ties to Gambit. Add Brother Voodoo into the mix and you have another crazy adventure that's just fun to read.<br /><br />X, Lies, and Videotape reprints Gambit #10 and is easily my favorite of the three stories. Gambit return to the X-Mansion to steal back an incriminating DVD mailed to Rogue by a rival. While stealing one DVD shouldn't be a problem for Remy he's side tracked when Kitty Pryde commands him to mentor 3 of Xavier's students that were caught stealing. He DOES mentor them, by teaching them the proper ins and outs of stealing. However, as the unexpected keeps happening and Rogue is getting closer and closer to coming home, Gambit's chances of saving his relationship with Rogue are growing slimmer and slimmer...<br /><br />Thieves's World, Gambit #11-12, finds Gambit back in New Orleans and in the middle of a giant mess involving a former New Warrior, Detective Takana, and his ex-wife Belladonna. Everyone has their own motives and agenda, though most people just want Gambit dead. Who's behind all these loose plot threads forming a noose for Gambit's neck.... Well, you'll have to read this to find out.<br /><br />Seriously, this is one of the best X-Men graphics out there. If you like Gambit at all or are even curious about this book buy it and you won't be disappointed.	2005-09-23

Written by Bob Fingerman and illustrated by Tommy Lee Edwards, it begins with a plague of rats attacking one woman, but the rats are infected by the zombie disease and soon it spreads throughout the whole city. The art is dark and moody, perfect for this genre. The script focuses on a select few characters and their reaction to the carnage and chaos around them. All of it combines for a hunting study in human nature, that's the typical high quality we've come to love and expect from Zombie World.<br /><br />\\" Eat Your Heart Out\\" is written and illustrated by Kelly Jones, easily my favorite Zombie World artist. The story is of a young man obsessed with the girl next door, even when she becomes a zombie, craving nothing more than to eat him alive. Their relationship unfolds in a truly bizarre way, making this a cringe-worthy read.<br /><br />\\" Home for the Holidays\\" is by Gordon Rennie and Gary Erskine. The tale of old Connecticut Family gathering for Christmas, it gives a new meaning to the phrase, \\" We'll all be together for the Holidays\\" as the Zombie virus infects the old family cemetery where 400 years worth of family members are buried. Erskine's art is crisp and photorealistic, Rennie's reactions from the dead and living are brilliant. This is my favorite tale in the collection.<br /><br />\\" Tree of Death\\" is my least favorite Zombie World tale. Set in London, it's written by Pat Mills and illustrated by J. Deadstock. The art is good, but not stunning, and the script tries to hard to be an Evil Dead story. I love Evil Dead, I love Zombie World, but they're not so great combined. It even had the `hero' who looks a lot like Bruce Campbell searching for the Necronomicon, which looks exactly the same as it does in Sam Raimi's classic. Filled with Satanic Goths, people possessed with ancient warriors, and the messiah of Zombies, Azzul Gotha, it is entertaining and bloody, but not the VERY high quality I've come to expect from this series.<br /><br />This is a great volume and I recommend it for zombie lovers everywhere. It's truly horrifying and creepy.the VERY high quality I've come to expect from this series.  <br /> <br />This is a great volume and I recommend it for zombie lovers everywhere.

US	37492827	R2IGD4CDAJOZV9	0785118772	661397222	Wolverine Classic, Vol. 2	Books	4	5	5	N	N	An odd start to a great set of Wolverine stories	This is the second in a series of graphic novels reprinting Wolverine's first ongoing series. Though the stories appear in black and white in Essential Wolverine vol. 1, this is the first time many of these have been published in color in graphic novel form. Though it gets off to an odd start, most of the stories in here are wonderful. It reprints Wolverine vol. 1 #6-10 and the break down of content is as follows:<br /><br />#6: This finishes up the story that was so abruptly cut off by the first graphic. I still think both books could have been strengthened if Marvel had decided to publish them taking stories into account instead of just numbers. This story finds Patch (Wolverine) in the middle of a gang war, with his friends Jessica, Lindsay, and Tyger Tiger. It's not a stunning story.<br /><br />#7 & 8: This guest stars the Hulk, back in his Mr. Fix-it days. When the Hulk shows up in Madripoor tricked into wading into the middle of another gang war, Wolverine sees a chance to play a few pranks on the Hulk who has no memory of Logan. The next few issues have lots of laughs, and more than a few moments that just make you smile, such as when Logan tricks the Hulk into purple pants. Silly? Yes. Fun? Yes.<br /><br />#9 Peter David and Gene Colan hand in the next story, which is my favorite in the book. A timeless tale of Wolverine's past as he rights a wrong done to an innocent is haunting, emotionally and visually. It's an often overlooked jewel of a tale.<br /><br />#10 Guest stars Sabretooth and provides the first mention of the elusive Silver Fox. Flashing between past and present this is a story of Wolverine's birthday, and though what is written is later proven to be a false memory, it's still a lot of fun to read.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good investment for any Wolverine fan, but it is probably best enjoyed by a comic fan, and not a newcomer, since it just jumps into the middle of an ongoing story.	2005-09-19

Ultimates 2 vol. 1: Gods and Monsters does something I didn't think was possible, it is better than either of the previous Ultimates volumes. Truly epic in scope, the second Ultimates series picks up one year after the previous tome. Banner is still a prisoner of Shield, Pym is on the outs with the team, though he's now Ant-Man, Iron Man and Black Widow are in love, and Thor has left. Though Wasp and Captain America are still together, not all is perfect with their relationship.<br /><br />Nor is this the end of the Ultimates troubles. Loki provides a foil that even the Ultimates can't destroy, and their own group dynamics threaten to drive the team apart. The characterization and fight scenes are easily some of the best in comics, bar none. To see Thor take on the entire Ultimates is worth the price of admission alone. There's also plenty of glimpses of things to come, such as Vision making a brief appearance. Also, the trial of Banner for crimes as the Hulk provides readers with something rare in comics, consequences.<br /><br />Reprinting Ultimates 2 #1-6, I can't describe to you just how good this volume is, only that I would place it in the same elite grouping as Watchmen, Preacher, and Miracle Man. It has my highest possible recommendations and can easily be read by fans or newcomers. Due to plenty of mature themes, it would probably be best for an audience 14 and older.<br /><br />Why are you still reading this review? Treat yourself and start reading Ultimates!	2005-09-04

After he is captured and brainwashed by the Hand, a mysterious Ninja sect, Logan becomes an unstoppable killing machine, butchering his way across the Marvel superhuman community. Nick Fury and Elektra are the only ones who have even the slightest clue on how to stop the unstoppable machine that Logan's become.<br /><br />After the past few Wolverine storylines- Brotherhood, Coyote Crossing, and Return of the Native- have all focused on non-costumed Logan stories that showcase the man, this storyline throws that to the side and reminds us why Wolverine is feared by all who oppose him.<br /><br />Millar's script is a nice combination of brutality, inside jokes, and character development, while John Romita Jr. returns to a set of characters- Elektra, Wolverine, Daredevil, the X-Men, that he knows well and draws to perfection.<br /><br />This is a comic collector must have! My highest recommendations.	2005-09-04

I love DAW anthologies and am a huge fan of the old Twilight Zone series, so why the ho-hum response on my part? The sad truth is that most stories in this volume aren't that good. I must agree with the previous reviewer that said most of the stories felt as if they were written on a whim, with little thought involved. Only a few stories were good, but 4 out of 24 isn't a good average. There are a few tales that shine through. Serling's \\" Lindemann's Catch\\" is brilliant as are most of his works. \\"Baby Girl Diamond\\" is haunting and touching, with a nice take on sibling relationships. \\" My Wiccan, Wiccan Ways\\" made me laugh out loud. I am a wiccan, and I think sometimes this story is too true. \\" The Knight of Greenwich Village\\" was good over all, but the end was a little overworked.<br /><br />Overall, this is worth the money, but just go into it knowing that you are unlikely to capture the essence of the most magical of television shows, The Twilight Zone. None of the stories (except perhaps Serling's own) felt much like the old show, sadly enough. I think I might have rated the book higher if it didn't have those two words on the cover, \\"Twilight Zone\\" but hearing that I just expect more.<br /><br />So if you get this, just keep an open mind which is more than I did.<br /><br />Recommended for anthology fans.	2005-08-28

In the last volume, Authority: Relentless, Ellis introduced the team and became comfortable with the characters. It was all leading up to this.<br /><br />In \\"Outer Dark\\" (#9-12) the team faces their strangest, strongest threat yet. At first a few alien creatures appear that are nearly invincible, taking the entire team to defeat. Then the horror of the situation is revealed. The threat is nothing more or less than `god'- the creator of the world who wants the planet back. The worst thing about the planet in `god's' eyes is annoying humans are all over it, so they need to be removed. To make matters worse, the leader of the Authority- Jenny Sparks- is not at her best. Not the best of times to say the least. This is easily Hitch's and Ellis's best work together. It has the feel to it the creators had fun with this book, and that fun feeling is highly contagious. I just can't sing enough praises about this arch.<br /><br />\\"The Nativity\\" has a lot of changes, both on the creative staff and the characters in the book. The story revolves around a baby of immeasurable power. With Jenny Sparks gone from the team, Jack steps up as leader. However, Authority is not the only ones looking for the baby. A fleet of superheroes are also after the child. The main ones featured are a lot like a twisted version of Ultimates. Keep in mind, this is written by the Ultimates scribe, Mark Millar. There's also twisted versions of almost every Marvel hero here, and in the background of the Carrier, look for Gen 13 cameos. Though a lot of people think the Millar and Quietly combo was worse than Ellis and Hitch, I don't think so. Yes, the book changed, but it is still the outrageous, irreverent book we all know and love.<br /><br />This is a bloody brilliant graphic and WELL worth the money. It's mature readers, that's my only caution. Other than that, get a copy for you, a copy for your friends and enjoy!Other than that, get a copy for you, a copy for your friends and enjoy! <br />	2005-08-21

Who knew indeed, other than the evil genius that is Warren Ellis. He and Hitch managed to take an `ok' so-so book like Stormwatch, and transformed it into Authority, something new and completely, deliciously different. This graphic, which reprints Authority volume 1 #1-8, actually contains two separate, complete story arcs.<br /><br />In \\" The Circle\\" (issues #1-4) Ellis and Hitch introduce us to the new team: Jenny Sparks, Apollo, Midnighter, Jack Hawksmoor, The Doctor, the Engineer, and Swift. Though at first glance, they seem to be the same old boring superhero archetypes we all know, Ennis gives each personality it's own twist: The Doctor (a combination Doctor Fate and Doctor Strange) is a drug addict with the knowledge of all the Doctors since the beginning of time, Apollo and Midnighter (who greatly resemble Batman and Superman) are a loving gay couple, and Jenny Sparks (Union Jack or Captain America) is a hard smoking, hard drinking 99 year old who still looks twenty. The threat they face here is a Wildstorm classic villain, Kaizen Gamorra who is trying to burn his logo into the world by destroying major cities: London, Moscow, and LA. Because this is the first arch and the characters are being introduced, this is my least favorite arch out of Ellis's run.<br /><br />\\"Swiftships\\" not only shows us more of Jenny Spark's past, it had the treat of an alternate earth that is filled with mass murdering, rapist aliens that have destroyed their world and is now after ours. Because it's also Hitch and Ellis, it's a smooth transition from the last arch, but it's a lot better in the story telling and pace.<br /><br />I highly recommend this for newcomers and seasoned comic collectors. It's fun, in-your-face, and different. Especially if you're a fan of Millar, Ellis, or Ennis- you should love this book. Because of the mature content, I wouldn't recommend this for younger readers, however. Everyone else, get a copy and enjoy!	2005-08-21

Though they are good, solid comics, this is so much more than that. It's created out of love, and it shows.<br /><br />The story revolves around a down on his luck supernatural private detective Cal McDonald, who finds himself in the middle of a gang war between various monsters. The story unfolds quickly, sucking you in. Once you start reading this, it's impossible to set down. Though the subject and the monsters are horrific, Niles, uses humor as an offset to remarkable effect. There were times when I was laughing out loud, I couldn't help it. Niles's dialogue is also at it's peak, as it is flowing and natural.<br /><br />And Templesmith's art perfectly suited for this story. With it's assortment of classic monsters, his wicked art, a combination of Jae Lee, Bill Sienkiewicz, yet beautifully his own renders the characters perfectly for the mood of the story.<br /><br />If you like monsters, if you like Sin City, or 30 Days of Night, if you're looking for a book that's different and way better than average, then give this graphic a try. I promise, you won't be disappointed in the least.<br /><br />Highly recommended to new fans and established comic collectors alike, but it is for mature readers.<br /><br />This graphic reprints Criminal Macabre #1-5 by Dark Horse Comics.	2005-08-20

In this anthology DAW presents 12 original tales, some funny, some sad, all about fairies. They include:<br /><br />***Sweet Forget-Me-Not by Charles de Lint<br /><br />*** The September People by Tim Waggoner<br /><br />*** Judgment by Kristine Kathryn Rusch<br /><br />*** Changeling by John Helfers<br /><br />*** Yellow Tide Foam by Sarah A.

It is not the best DAW anthology out there. Many of the stories use repetitive themes. One third of the stories deal with changelings and stolen children. There's so many other things the fairies are known for, why dwell on this one point? Also, Stolen Child and Witches'-Broom, Apple Soon were both clinkers by usually good writers. However, to balance this, a Piece of Flesh and Sweet Forget-Me-Not are both bloody brilliant, the type of haunting story that sticks in your brain long after you're done reading the book.<br /><br />This is more of a mixed bag than the usual DAW excellence, but it's still well worth buying in my opinion.	2005-08-19

Forget Joss Wheaton's lovable camp, or Morbius's dark brooding in the pages of Spider-Man. No, the vampires here are remorseless, brutal, and above all else cunning. They stop at nothing, and want only death. They are not harmed by wooden crosses, holy water, or stakes, nor are they stopped by running water.<br /><br />The only thing that can stop them is the sun. Unfortunately for the residents of Barrow, Alaska, the sun has just set and will not rise for 30 days, and the vampires have arrived in mass, to kill, too feed. Though I will not offer spoilers I will say the ending is surprisingly touching, leaving a sweet, melancholy note to the entire affair.<br /><br />Steve Niles's script is very good, better than most on the market, and Ben Templesmith reminds me very much of Bill Sienkiewicz, who's better known work includes Eletrka Assassin. Eclectic and energetic, the art is interesting and visually captivating.<br /><br />Over all, this isn't the run of the mill graphic novel, and it has a very underground feel to it. It edgy and fun in a very dark way, and recommended to underground comic fans especially.<br /><br />This graphic collects 30 Days of Night #1-3 and has the script for issue #1.	2005-08-11

Some of the stories take place in our own history, some take place in fantasy realms. The only reason I gave this story 4 stars instead of 5 is several stories have a very unfinished feel about them, and a few of the stories are just poorly written. But only a few clinkers with the rest of the stories being as strong and fierce as they are makes this anthology well worth the price.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-08-08

Though not all stories take place during the Civil War, some involve recreations, all capture the essence of the conflict, the pride, pain, and hope that made it so tragic. A complete list of the stories is:<br /><br />*** Martial by Nancy Springer, *** A Place to Stand by kWilliam H. Keith, Jr., *** Hex'em John by James H. Cobb, *** Gettysburg Dreams by Brendan Du Bois, *** Images by Josepha Sherman, *** Ghosts of Honor by Denise Little, *** Boot Hill by Asaro and Resnick, ***The Three Cigars by Robert Sheckley, *** The General's Bane by Mike and Shiela Gilbert, *** The Federal Spy and Mix Julia by Karen Haber, ***Stew by Donald J.

Ten years ago, all X-Men titles stopped for 4 months, replaced by a horrifying world called the Age of Apocalypse. In this world Professor Xavier had been killed, leaving Magneto to create the X-Men and guard the world from the horror Apocalypse created, a world were humans were being exterminated and only the strong could survive. In a final battle, this world was supposed to end, to be restored to the X-Continuity we know (and love)....<br /><br />But ten years after that crossover event, comes this graphic novel. We learn that world did not end, but continued. Apocalypse has been defeated, but enough of his evil remains in the world that the X-Men are still at the center of rebuilding. Not only must they rebuild the world, but their own team, who has suffered and must be drawn back together. It's the usual X-Men twists and turns, just with different takes on the characters that we know and love. This volume features Wolverine and X-23 prominently, as well as the Phoenix in all her fiery glory. Magneto, Charles, Rogue, Gambit, Nightcrawler, Storm, and Quicksliver are also featured characters.<br /><br />This volume also lets us see characters that are now fan favorites, but weren't around or included in the original Age of Apocalypse, including Xorn, Beak, Cloak and Dagger, Psylocke, and the Hellions.<br /><br />Also in this graphic are four small mini stories first published as a one shot, that gives background on the characters and makes the rest of the graphic easy to understand.<br /><br />This volume can be enjoyed by someone who knows nothing of Age of Apocalypse continuity, but it is easier to understand if you have read the other AOA stories before. This trade collects the Age of Apocalypse miniseries from 2005 and the AOA one shot that proceeded it.<br /><br />Over all this is very enjoyable. Just be aware if you aren't already that these characters are different in personality from their mainstream X-Men counterparts.<br /><br />Recommended.d.  <br />	2005-08-03

A Walk on the Darkside fits right in with this gorey tradition. Over 21 stories written by some of the industries best, we see all the dark, twisted sides of humanity.<br /><br />Like so many anthologies, many of the stories are average, with about five of them being spectacular, and about four that were really poorly done. Even the worst story still isn't that bad, though, and the rest keep the pages turning quickly.<br /><br />\\" Something in the Air\\" by Michael Laimo is my far and away favorite, and well worth checking out. Eerie and haunting, this story stuck with me well after I was done reading it. \\" Fairy Fort\\" by Peadar O' Guilin is a dark and disturbing look at the wee folk and being careful for what you wish for. It's also well worth reading.<br /><br />Over all, this is a good solid anthology and a worthy addition to any horror and/or anthology collection. Recommended.	2005-08-02

Watchmen, the first Preacher graphic, Dark Knight.... All of them were no only great literary works -they were new. Joining this select group is Wanted.<br /><br />Often you hear books claiming to be a fresh take on heroes and villains, but this book delivers. Wesley Gibson is a poor, slovenly looser with nothing going on for him, until he finds that not only is he the son of the world's most dangerous villain, he's also the villain's heir, with the condition that he learns to become a hard nosed killer, and learns to take control of his life. The world is unlike any other comic book world. All the heroes are dead, or remade, and only villains exists now.<br /><br />But the plot only begins there. With only villains left betrayal, brutality, and bloodshed run rampant. With more plot twists and turns than a Gordian knot, Wanted is the hard hitting uncompromising book.<br /><br />Needless to say, the language is realistically foul, and book is soaked in blood. It's definitely a mature readers only title.<br /><br />For those of you who are still thinking about getting it, stop thinking and grab one now. It's Millar uncensored, and that's just as scary as a world full of villains.<br /><br />This volume contains Wanted #1-6, Wanted: Dossier #1, behind the scenes notes, and a full cover gallery.<br /><br />Highest possible recommendations.	2005-08-02

My run away favorite is True Love by Fahnestock and Custer. It's a real eye opener with a shock ending so good I immediately forced the book upon my friend and made her read it. The only reason this anthology gets 4 stars instead of 5 is that many of the same fairy tales are revisited time and again. With the wide variety of world myth a greater amount of stories could have been retold.<br /><br />Also, if this book is a personal favorite, check out Rotten Relations also edited by Denise Little for DAW. It's also a retelling of fairy tales from the `villains' point of view, and a highly entertaining book.	2005-07-26

As a lifelong fan of Jack Kirby's work, I was anxious to read Ronin Ro's biography of the great, tragic master artist. I wasn't disappointed. Tales to Astonish is a fascinating look at Kirby's life, from his early days as Jacob Kurtzberg in Manhattan, to his early art days, his days in the army during WWII it's easy to see how these dramatic and occasionally traumatic events provided the fuel and pathos for Kirby to co-create the Fantastic Four, The Hulk, Thor, the X-Men, the Avengers, and countless other characters for Marvel. Though this book goes in depth into Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's always dynamic, often dysfunctional relationship, it does try to present a balanced view by also quoting Stan and letting the reader draw their own conclusions. After the break with Marvel, it recounts the creation of Kirby's Fourth World at DC (my favorite era) and follows him through until the bittersweet end.<br /><br />Not only is it Kirby's story, but many other creators are featured, such as Stan Lee, John Romita, Joe Simon, Mark Evanier, and many more. Roz Kirby, the Queen mother of comicdom also has her tale told.<br /><br />This is not only an invaluable lesson in comic history, but in the human condition. It's the story of one man's life that is more extraordinary than any of the characters he created. It should not only be read by every comic book fan, but every student of pop culture, and every artist who even thinks about working freelance.<br /><br />Highly recommended to all!	2005-07-25

As if his career as Spider-Man isn't filled with enough people that hate him, someone else is posing as Spider-Man and robbing people. It's actually much worse than it appears at first, when yet another person close to Peter is killed, this time by the Spider-Man impostor.<br /><br />His love life is also complicated more, here. With Gwen Stacy in need of comfort, she runs to Peter and his Aunt May for comfort. How much of Gwen wanting to be with Peter is friendship and how much is romance isn't revealed, but it does bend MJ to the breaking point. While I did enjoy MJ and Peter's close relationship from the off, this tension and disharmony is more in keeping with the regular Spider-Man continuity, at least in the beginning.<br /><br />The writing and art are perfect. Bendis and Bagley are a great duo, who work very well together. This fan girl is wishing them many happy years of collaboration.<br /><br />Public Scrutiny reprints Ultimate Spider-Man #28-32 and is a fine addition to any Spider-Man collection.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-07-13

This review is for Ultimate Spider-Man vol. 3 paperback edition: Double Trouble<br /><br />Doctor Octopus has long been one of Spider-Man's greatest villains, and this volume sees his entrance into the Ultimates world. Horribly disfigured after his accident in Osborn lab's in volume one, Otto Octavius insane and out for blood. Add into the mix, Kraven, who fancies himself the world's ultimate hunter, and his new prey is Spider-Man.<br /><br />Once again, Bendis bring his best game when scripting this book. The writing is wonderful, the characters very real and very human. His take on Gwen Stacy is very unlike mainstream Gwen Stacy but the result is a very likable character. His approach to Mary Jane and Peter's relationship is also very teenage and appealing.<br /><br />Bagley and Thibert's pencils are nice, and appropriate to the book, though the character's are a little wide eyed at times, and their take on Doc Ock's body didn't mesh with my personal image of the character.<br /><br />This is the perfect Ultimate Spider-Man graphic to buy for someone who has seen Spider-Man 2 and wants to read a comic with Doc Ock in it. This book is also appropriate for all ages and for comic collectors and newcomers alike.<br /><br />This volume reprints Ultimate Spider-Man #14-21. Highest recommendations!	2005-07-13

This review refers to Ultimate Spider-Man vol. 6 paperback edition: Venom<br /><br />After other Spider-Man villains, finally fans are treated to the coming of Ultimate Venom! My personal favorite out of Spidey's rogue's gallery, Eddie Brock is given a background and origin very different from the main stream character. Also, Spider-Man's black suit origin is much different. No longer is the grand space-opera of the Secret War mentioned. Now it is a life saving experiment gone wrong.<br /><br />Not only does Bendis do a flawless job of presenting Venom, he further complicates Peter and MJ's relationship, and the hints of tension with Gwen grow.<br /><br />My only gripe about Ultimate Spider-Man is a small one, but does EVERYONE know Peter Parker is Spider-Man? Whatever happened to a secret identity being secret, anyway? Yet another character learns Peter's secret in this volume, making me wonder who's next?<br /><br />Bendis's scripting is very good, and I think this is Bagley's best art yet.<br /><br />This volume reprints Ultimate Spider-Man #33-39, and can be enjoyed by all ages, by newcomers and established fans.<br /><br />Highly recommended!	2005-07-13

This review is for Ultimate Spider-Man vol. 4 paperback edition: Legacy<br /><br />You can never keep a good villain down. That's true for all comic book worlds, including Ultimates, which is why Norman Osborn, the Green Goblin makes his return in this addition to the Ultimate Spider-Man library. Far more twisted and evil than in volume 1, Norman is determined to either own or destroy Peter. Nor is Norman Osborn the only threat presented. Nick Fury, of Ultimates fame, makes his presence known to our favorite wall crawler, upping the level of danger for all involved. The end of the original Goblin is slightly different than in original continuity, and more touching in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Bendis continues to grow and improve with his characterization as he makes these very classic characters his own. The dialog is flawless, appropriate, and flowing as always. His way of showing the madness in Osborn is brilliant, and must be seen. Once you've read those pages, re-read them. It's worth the time and it's too much to take in at once. Bendis is one of the most beloved and well known writers in the comic book industry for a reason, this volume showcases his talents well.<br /><br />Bagley and Thibert also continue to grow and find their own take on the characters. Their rendition of the Green Goblin is horrible, interesting, and chilling. The human characters are marvelously human, which doesn't happen much in comics anymore.<br /><br />While this volume can be read alone, I recommend having read at least vol. 1 before. It is appropriate for all ages, and is enjoyable for newcomers and seasoned collectors alike.<br /><br />This volume reprints Ultimate Spider-Man issues #22-27. Highest recommendations!	2005-07-13

Now, Learning Curve grows and matures. This volume sees Peter gaining his job at the Bugle and battleing the Kingpin, who provides the plot for most of this book. It also conatins great chariterization moments for Parker, when he realizes that his being Spider-Man could potenitally harm the ones he loves.<br /><br />Bendis's scripting is as delicious as ever, and in this edition he's grown into the chaacters. He's obviously more comfortable with the title than he was in the previous graphic. His sceen with Aunt May trying to talk to Peter about sex is worth buying the book for, alone.<br /><br />Bagley's pencil work is still as fluid and flowing as before. It's a little rougher than I perfer in some places but it is still far ahead of most artists in the industry.<br /><br />This is a great graphic for Spider-Man fans, young and old. Nothing in here should offend young readers, and it's enjoyable for all age levels. Highly recommended for young and old readers alike.	2005-07-12

A retelling/re-imagining of the classic early Spider-Man stories, including Amazing Fantasy #15, this is a perfect starting point for fans of the movies who want to read Spider-Man but find the normal comic confusing.<br /><br />But even hardcore Spider-Man fans will find this graphic well worth the money. The script by Brian Bendis flows well, with realistic dialog and all the teen angst that has always been a staple for Spidey, and the art by Bagley is perfect. Bagley captures the cast and crew in perfect detail.<br /><br />Yes, a few of my friends that are traditionalist Spider-Man fans bristled at some of the changes. However, if you're looking to read the original series, it's available in many formats including Essential Spider-Man, or for those with deeper pockets, Marvel Masterworks Spider-Man. This is a deviation, which is what makes it fresh and new.<br /><br />This particular edition reprints Ultimate Spider-Man #1-7. Highest recommendations to newcomers and long time fans alike.	2005-07-12

They were thought dead, and scattered across the globe. Wolverine found himself in Madripoor, an island where anything goes and anything can be bought or sold for a price. Immediately, he finds himself neck deep in intrigue and a power struggle between two crime lords. Of course, he can't tell anyone the truth of who he is, so he adopts the personality named `Patch', one he uses off and on for some time to come. This volume also introduces the character Tyger Tiger, a headstrong woman who was to become Wolverine's lover for many adventures.<br /><br />First published in 1988, written by Chris Claremont and drawn by John Buscema, this volume seems a little dated, but still fun. There are only a few flaws that make it a 4 star book and not a 5 star book. One is that the main `super villain' for Logan to fight is nothing more than some profession wrestler looking guy with knives at the end of his hands. Just because Wolverine has knives at the end of his hands doesn't mean his villains must as well. Also the `Patch' personality always seemed a little silly to me. It's just Wolverine with an eye patch on! Who was really fooled?<br /><br />Still, this volume introduces Madripoor, Patch, and Tyger, all of whom are important to the Wolverine mythos, and this book is worth a read for the history alone.<br /><br />Recommended for both veteran fans and comic newcomers as you can read this without knowing anything about Wolverine or the X-Men.	2005-07-05

The story revolves around Remy, as he takes some time away from the X-Men to return home. There, he is hired by a beautiful blond to steal infamously evil tarot cards from her uncle. But things are rarely simple for Gambit, and soon he's in trouble of every kind, being chased by the assassin's guild, jealous women, demons, and cops. Wolverine even pops in for an appearance, just for good measure.<br /><br />The story is engaging and the art is beautiful, very reminiscent of Adam Hughes or Terry Dodson. Jeanty is definitely an artist I'd like to see more of. The writing is an odd mix of Claremont and Giffen's styles, action packed, character driven, and funny all at the same time.<br /><br />This graphic can be enjoyed by new comers to comics and veteran collectors alike, and it<br /><br /> has my highest recommendations.	2005-07-02

Strong, confident, and beautiful, she used her telepathy to get what she wanted. But it wasn't always so.<br /><br />This graphic takes us back to the time Emma was a shy, brown haired, frumpy, flat chested school girl, full of fear and insecurity, with a horribly controlling family. Just how controlling that family is, in particular, her father, is revealed over the course of the graphic. The family bickering, backstabbing, and betrayal is worse than any `80's soap opera. As Emma gains her mental powers and confidence, it will be all she can do to survive.<br /><br />Higher Learning collects Emma Frost #1-6 in digest form, and is perfect for teen readers. The writing is solid and the art is pretty decent. Some of the content makes it more suitable for older teens instead of younger ones, however. Because this book isn't mired in continuity, it can easily be enjoyed by long time comic readers or newcomers.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-06-29

Continuing the story from Dark Horse's previous volume, Female War, this story focuses on the Alien's home world. In Female War, Ripley and the others took the Alien Queen Mother to earth. Now, on the Alien's planet, without her, two queens are vying for the title and the planet is being torn apart.<br /><br />Back on earth, Corporate Billionaire Daniel Grant has created a new wonder drug called Xeno Zip, which makes the user feel immortal, makes them bigger, more agressive, and stronger than ever. However, some people have a severe reaction and inadvertently kill themselves. With law suits threatening to ruin his empire, he needs a pure form of the drug, Alien Queen Royal Jelly. After making a deal with the military, he and several Marines are off to the aliens home world to obtain a fresh supply.<br /><br />This is a very good offering from Dark Horse. The art is a little rough, but the style is perfect for the Alien's series. The idea of alien's battling each other is executed very well, and it's interesting to see. The human characters are reminiscent of the human heroes in the previous Aliens books without being rip-offs or clones.<br /><br />Aliens: Genocide takes place between Aliens: Female War and Aliens: Hive, and collects Aliens: Genocide #1-4. It's very interesting reading, and highly recommended for fans of the Alien's movies.	2005-06-28

Perhaps that is a product of Steve Perry finally becoming completely comfortable with his characters, perhaps it is the inclusion of Ellen Ripley.<br /><br />As with the other books, the pacing in this volume is fast and thrilling, keeping with the feel of the movies, and as is tradition with this series, the threat level is stepped up from the last volume so the threat is more horrific than ever- a massive Queen of all Queens, the Alien that controls them all and has the ability to telepathically control humans, as well.<br /><br />The character development is brilliant, and I love the way the author manages to include Ripley without shattering cannon. I was wondering how that would work out, but the Perry's handled it very well.<br /><br />Over all, it's a fast fun read and a nice conclusion to the trilogy: Earth Hive, Nightmare Asylum, and now Female War. I recommended it for fans of the movies.	2005-06-27

Determined to make someone pay, Logan beings an investigation to find who the people are that are responsible for this horror and it leads him to a very interesting place.  <br /> <br />In the mean time, ATF agent Cassie Lathrop is conducting an investigation of her own, to find Logan, though she can't really decide why she needs to find him. Is it to see if her attraction to him is returned, or to find out what he really is? <br /> <br />The script by Rucka is solid and the art by Fernandez is better than most other art out there, though I prefer Derek Robertson on this title. The reason I decided on 4 stars and not 5 is that this story doesn't really advance Logan's character or show anything new. It's a little too much like Brotherhood, the pervious graphic for my taste.  <br /> <br />Still, this is a solid, well crafted book and I recommend it.  <br /> <br />This book collects Wolverine vol. 3 #7-11 <br />	2005-06-25

Return of the Native is also a return to a more `traditional' Wolverine story than those presented in Brotherhood or Coyote Crossing. Once again tormented by his past in the Weapon X program and lack of memories, Logan has to battle to save another runaway from the program, the beautiful and mysterious Native.<br /><br />The basic story line is solid, and Robertson's art is brilliant as always, but the true reason for the five star rating is the battle between Wolverine and Sabretooth. Never before have I seen such graphic violence between the two! It was brilliant, showcasing their true contempt for each other. And just when we as readers are able to almost accept Sabretooth as `just' another Weapon X program bad guy, he reminds the world what a truly horrible, rotten person he is at the end.<br /><br />This is one of the better Wolverine graphics in years, and it gets my highest recommendations. Just a quick word of warning, the violence is VERY graphic and the mature topics make it unsuitable for younger readers, but for the rest of us, it's perfect!	2005-06-25

This comic book version uses Hicks and Newt, but the Steve Perry version that doesn't is as good, which is a huge compliment.<br /><br />The book is a fast, fun read, perfect for light vacation reading if being scared is your cup of tea, because this book is frightening, one of the scariest of the aliens series.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of the Aliens films and sci-fi fans everywhere.	2005-06-24

Though most writers have struggled to bring the quick timing of the Aliens movies into book form, Steve Perry seems like he was born for the challenge.<br /><br />This book serves as an alternate sequel for Aliens. The scared marine that is obviously Hicks is called Wilks here, and Newt is called Billie. Ripley is left out because it would be hitting too close to the original. Still, there's no doubt that Hicks and Newt these characters are. Wilks' face and chest were burned and scared with alien blood, Billie's flash back to her parents being taken by aliens perfectly mirrors Newt's memories from the aliens extended edition word for word of dialog.<br /><br />Ten years after their encounter, Billie and Wilks are forced by the government to face the aliens again, this time of the aliens own home world. While they're facing that nightmare, people back on earth are having nightmares of their own, dreaming of the alien monsters. What no one knows is one of the monsters has been smuggled to earth, and soon disaster follows.<br /><br />As a fan of the second movie, Aliens, I happen to like this sequel better than Aliens 3. It's gritty, scary, and very human all at the same time. I highly recommend it to fans of the movies and sci-fi fans in general.	2005-06-23

Ripley, reunited with them, is as take charge as ever. Beautiful and tough, she's poised to take on her biggest challenge yet, the annihilation of the alien threat from Earth, that's almost completely taken over.<br /><br />Her idea lies with the Alien home world and the Queen of all Queens, who's emitting a signal to call all her `children' back to her. Ripley knows that with all the aliens in one place and enough nukes to eliminate a small planet, she can destroy the aliens once and for all.<br /><br />But things are rarely easy, and soon Ripley finds herself clashing with the two people she cares for most, Newt and Hicks.<br /><br />I like this book a lot. Verheiden's script and story are slightly stilted at times, but they're still very good. Sam Kieth, best known for his work on Image's Maxx, is a brilliant artist who's perfectly suited for Aliens.<br /><br />My only word of warning is that if you've read Steve Perry's Aliens prose works, they mesh and tangle with this graphic enough you feel you've read the same story twice, but since this has Hicks, Newt, and Ripley, I like his version more, personally.<br /><br />This would make a solid addition for any collector of Aliens graphics, but it is part 3 and buying the other two that came before would lend a better understanding, because this just jumps right in at the middle of the action and story.	2005-06-23
US	37492827	R3SFFTS0P8ZSVB	0785100504	524261163	Sabretooth: DeathHunt	Books	5	8	8	N	N	Gritty, Brutal, Bloody	Sabretooth: Death Hunt is one of the best Sabretooth stories of all time. In this volume, masterfully drawn by Mark Texiera and powerfully scripted by Larry Hama, Sabretooth is kidnapped by a mysterious madman and given 48 hours to track down and kill Mystique, or the bomb the madman implanted in Creed will explode. Faced with death, Creed sets out to obliterate Mystique and save his life. Still, things are rarely easy, and this is no exception. Betrayed by the beautiful telepathic assistant, Birdy, Creed is running out of places to turn, just as he's confronted by his past. Shown through flashbacks we see not only Creed's brutally abusive childhood, but a loving, tender relationship filled with passion and honesty, something we've not seen in Creed before or since. Just as he comes across Mystique and is set to fulfill the contract, Wolverine rushes into the rescue. Minutes tick away with Creed's life on the line as the book builds to it's surprising climax.<br /><br />This is easily one of my favorite Sabretooth stories of all time. Texiera's art is unique, dark, and perfectly suited for this story. Larry Hama spins a tale for Creed that is unlike what had been done for the character before, while staying very true to the character's personality.<br /><br />Sabretooth Death Hunt is well worth the time it might take to track it down. Highly recommended.	2005-06-22
US	37492827	R2SOS8UL4KRXYY	B0006OZH1M	386301291	Aliens: Newt's Tale	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Aliens, extended edition	Newt's Tale is a good, solid movie adaptation of Aliens, with a few additions. The first twenty or so pages tells the story of Newt's family, and how the alien plague beset the colonists. It's interesting to get the backdrop to the story that we weren't provided in the regular edition Aliens movie. However, once the story moves to the Marines coming, it becomes a movie adaptation, strait across the board. Nothing new or original is added until the last page of the book.<br /><br />It would have been strengthened if the adaptation were less literal, if it showed some of the more quiet moments the film missed.<br /><br />Still, Richardson's script is good, and Somerville is a good artist for the book. The aliens are dead on accurate in the way they look, although the people don't look exactly like the actors in the movie.<br /><br />If Rebecca Jorden, AKA Newt is one of your favorite characters, and you don't mind an adaptation graphic novel, this is a good addition to an Alien's collection.	2005-06-22

Frank Miller is known these days more for his work on Sin City, but once he revolutionized Matt Murdock, making him not only a relevant comic character again, but a fan favorite. Man Without Fear has Miller returning to Matt Murdock with a bone crushing, teeth gnashing, hard hitting origin story, detailing Matt's journey from childhood, to his first adventure as a masked crime fighter.<br /><br />Of course, no origin of Matt would be complete without the inclusion of Miller's greatest creation for Marvel, the mysterious Elektra. Though she's only in part of the story, her sway over Matt greatly shapes his character. Their relationship is beautiful, complicated and destined for tragedy.<br /><br /> Kingpin, Foggy Nelson, Jack Murdock, Fixer, and many other Daredevil staple characters are included.<br /><br />This is the best Daredevil origin out there, and every comic collection should have a copy. It's brilliant. `Nuff said.	2005-06-22

It's set in Madripoor back when Wolverine was using his Patch disguise, and like so many other stories set in that time, it has Logan neck deep in Lowtown corruption as he bumps into and saves people he knows from his X-Men days.<br /><br />The first story, reprinting #1-3 is about the Black Blade, a fabled sword created by Maramasa, a master swordsman. Any time you have a story about Samurai and fabled swords, the Silver Samurai can't be far behind and that is the case here. Not only does he appear, but Lindsay McCabe and Jessica Drew, better known as Spider Woman. The story wraps up with a slightly surprising end, and it's a good read.<br /><br />The next story, covering #4-5 showcases another power struggle between Madripoor crime lords, this time General Nguyen Ngoc Coy and Tyger Tiger. Two new badguys are introduced, Roughhouse a brawler, and Bloodsport, a vampire who's very touch causes people to bleed. Karma, formerly of the New Mutants also makes an appearance. However, just as the story builds up and gets interesting, the graphic is over, and the ending never supplied.<br /><br />This book could have been made much stronger had it included the next couple of books which wrap up the General Nguyen Ngoc Coy storyline.<br /><br />Overall, this is very typical of Logan's days as Patch and it's worth a look as long as you're forewarned it ends in an odd spot.	2005-06-21
US	37492827	R3M8O87NA9Y9WJ	1563894807	602058747	Justice League of America: The Nail	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Life without Krypton	Like so many other Elseworlds books, this starts with the simple question, \\" What would the DC universe be like if Superman had never been found by the Kents?\\" That question is answered by Alan Davis and Mark Farmer in this masterwork, and the answer is frightening. Without a Superman to check Lex Luthor, he's attained godlike political power, and his political platform is to criminalize all earth's heroes. Mysteriously, cameras are around to capture and misinterpret acts by various league members to make them look like monsters. Who's really behind the plan to wipe out the league is a shock, and the book has a nice twist ending.<br /><br />It's also stunning to see Alan Davis's artistic take on so many DC heroes. Everyone from Katana to Black Canary, from Catwoman to Killer Croc, it seems 50% of the DCU is crammed into this one graphic novel, but not in a way that feels forced or rushed.<br /><br />There are some very dark and disturbing moments in this volume, so it is better suited for older readers rather than younger ones. And because it's an Elseworlds it can be read by newcomers and veteran collectors alike.<br /><br />Highly recommended for comic book fans.	2005-06-20

Several favorites are remade, Jack and the Bean Stalk, Peter Pan, Little Red Riding Hood, and Aladdin are a few included. Rarely are the stories immediately recognizable, the changing of the characters name and setting often makes this seem like a strait fantasy anthology. Tanya Huff's \\"Jack and the BS\\" and Pamela Sargent's \\" Puss in DC\\" are laugh out loud hilarious, and it is worth getting the anthology just for these stories alone. Luckily, they're not the only good stories included. Even the weakest of these stories is still darn good.<br /><br />It's also worth noting that Bill Willingham, author of the graphic novel series \\"Fables\\" has a prose story in this anthology. If this anthology is really your cup of tea, it's worth it to try some of Willingham's Fable's books, which is where this anthology took it's inspiration. That series also deals with classic fairy tale characters placed in the modern setting.<br /><br />Over all, this anthology is another strong, classy book by DAW publishers and Martin Greenberg. Recommended for Fantasy fans, Fairy Tales fans, and Anthology lovers.	2005-06-16
US	37492827	R1HXVICKAUEXHS	0785105867	17667747	The Rise of Apocalypse (X-Men)	Books	3	1	3	N	N	A weak origin for a strong character	Apocalypse, one of the strongest characters in the Marvel universe, has long deserved a strong origin story for a long time. Sadly, this isn't it. The story starts off with a roar. The first 40 or so pages develop an interesting story with En Sabah Nur being cast out from his tribe for his mutation and perceived weakness, then the infant is found by a tough nomadic tribe that believes in survival of the fittest over all else. This is certainly a way to explain the beginnings of Apocalypse's obsession.<br /><br />Unfortunately, after the first 40 or so pages, it seems both scripter Kavanagh and penciller Pollina loose interest and they have to have people brought in to help them finish. That might be because in the middle of a story in ancient Egypt, the Fantastic Four are brought in. I know technically they did travel to this time period, but why this has to be included in the middle of an Apocalypse story is beyond me.<br /><br />Kavanagh has produced great work before and will again. Adam Pollina remains one of my favorite pencillers for his off beat style. My fear of Apocalypse continues, but this is one graphic where the stars did not line up right. It's a weak effort, and should probably be avoided unless you're a die hard X-Men fan.	2005-06-13

All the stories in this volume are original, so no chance of reading something , unless it's been reprinted later. For an original anthology, a large amount of horror short story masters are represented.  The stories are entertaining, and some are down right chilling. The biggest stand out story for me was Haunted World by Robert McCammon. A very unusual and twisted take on the typical `dead coming back to life to destroy the living tale' it left me with goose bumps, and an uneasy feeling. After reading as many horror stories as I do, it's nice to come away scared once in a while. Eyes of the Sword maker by Linzner also was pleasantly creepy.<br /><br /> ***Each Night, Each Year by Kathryn Ptacek<br /><br />***Mark of the Loser by Gary Brandner<br /><br />***Timeskip by Charles de Lint<br /><br />***Resettling by Steve Rasnic Tem and Melanie Tem<br /><br />***The Servitor by Janet Fox<br /><br />***Blanca by Thomas Tessier<br /><br />***Nine Gables by James Howard Kunstler<br /><br />***The Last Cowboy Song by Charles L.

The action continues relatively unabated throughout. Telling a version of how the Autobots & Decepticons came to earth, it centers around Mini-Cons. Tons of fan favorites, including Megatron, Optimus Prime, Starscream, and Sparkplug appear. The art is very typical of Dreamwave's techno/anime style and the scripting is pretty solid. The humor and action combine nicely, with neither out weighing each other. Personally, I could have done with less cute little kids, but I can see why they were included to broaden reader appeal.<br /><br />This was the first Transformers comic I've read since Marvel's Transformers comic in the 80's, and I found it readable and sweetly nostalgic.<br /><br />This volume reprints Transformers Armada #1-5, the 8 page preview, the mini-comic and it has a full cover gallery.<br /><br />Since it is a new take on the Transformers it is highly suitable for a newcomer (like myself) or a seasoned fan.	2005-06-12

Immediately, the brainwashing and Adamantium bonding begins. A bald, twisted man named Professor is behind it all, though he seems to be taking orders from some invisible backer. Dr. Cornelius and his assistant Miss Hines are reluctant aids to the barbarism.<br /><br />This tells the story from Logan's kidnapping to his escape. Barry Windsor-Smith both scripts and provides the breathtaking art. It's a shame he doesn't produce comics and graphics more often. The pencil work is unique and the scripting is solid.<br /><br />By far, this is one of my favorite Wolverine stories and I recommend it for comic book fans and newcomers alike.<br /><br />This reprints the Wolverine stories from Marvel Comics Presents #72-84.	2005-06-11

He begins the tale as Nathaniel Essex, brilliant but misunderstood scientist who, in the age of creationism believes in evolution. Even Darwin thinks Essex insane. Driven by the death of the deformed son he was unable to save, and fear for the unborn child his wife is carrying he is soon pushing past morality into monstrosity.<br /><br />When a band of thugs Essex employs, named Marauders, set out to collect mutants they accidentally awaken Apocalypse. That's when Apocalypse begins the task of turning Essex into Sinister.<br /><br />The dialogue is solid, the art is dark, heavy, and moody, which is perfect for the feeling of the book.<br /><br />The bad news is the inclusion of Cyclops and Phoenix. Transported to the past by Sanctity, their presence feels forces, and could be excluded entirely. It feels like they were only added to boost sales.<br /><br />The good and bad balance here to make this a readable, but not spectacular book. I recommend it for X-Men fans, but I do not recommend it for new comic book readers due to the messy continuity.	2005-06-11

This volume is a tribute to Chewbacca, with C-3P and R2-D2 interviewing Chewbacca's friends and family. Darko Macan scripts the entire volume, but a different artist provides art for each of the characters. The pairings are<br /><br />***  Brent Anderson - Mallatobuck<br /><br />***  Igor Kordey - Attichitcuk<br /><br />***  Jan Duursema - Ssoh<br /><br />***  Dave Gibbons - Mala Mala<br /><br />***  Dusty Abell - Tvrrdko<br /><br />***  John Nadeau - Wedge Antilles<br /><br />***  Martin Egeland - Lando Calrissian<br /><br />***  Kilian Plunkett - Leia Organa-Solo<br /><br />***  Rafael Kayanan - Luke Skywalker<br /><br />***  Dusty Abell - Han Solo<br /><br />A few of the stories are brilliant, but most are average at best. Several of the characters aren't quite themselves, including Leia, who is portrayed as a very selfish child throwing a temper tantrum.<br /><br />I recommend Star Wars: Empire graphic novels for a good classy Star Wars read which can be enjoyed by all, which sadly this isn't.<br /><br />This reprints Chewbacca #1-4 published by Dark Horse.	2005-06-11

Originally published as Deadpool: Circle Chase #1-4 in 1993, this graphic is VERY reflective of the style prominent then, with big hair, big muscles, and most of all, big guns.<br /><br />The story revolves around the will of Tolliver, former boss of Deadpool and various other mercenaries, Tolliver had left behind a weapon of unimaginable power with only one rule who will inherit this price: \\"to the victor go the spoils\\". Now everyone is struggling to gain power, kill each other, and unlock the secret of the will.<br /><br />One of the largest problems with this story is the size of the ensemble cast. Deadpool is eclipsed by Weasel, Vanessa, Kane, Black Tom, Juggernaut , and MANY others.<br /><br />There are some great character origin moments, the art and dialogue are solid, and it's a fun, solid read.<br /><br />While a newcomer to comics could read this, I would recommend it more for comic book fans due to the large cast and semi-convoluted continuity of Marvel in the `90's.	2005-06-11

The little girl's father has the perfect solution, a new designer steroid called Venom that will build Batman's muscles as he sits doing detective work. He begins taking it with strictly good intentions, but soon finds himself turning his back on everything and everyone he holds dear, turning into the type of monster he fights. Soon he's lost in a world of designer super soldiers and designer drugs that tests his faith in himself. Though not mentioned in this story it is interesting that venom is later the drug that would help create Bane.<br /><br />O'Neil and Von Eeden are at the top of their game with his brutal, cold story, that ranks among the great works by Miller such as Batman: Year One, and Batman: The Dark Knight Returns. It also is every bit as gritty as The Killing Joke. I can not recommend this strongly enough.<br /><br />Batman Venom reprints Batman Legends of the Dark Knight #16-20.	2005-06-08

Still alone except for Alfred, Batman has not yet earned Gotham City's trust. That leads him down a dangerous path as psychologist Hugo Strange leads a police hunt to bring the Caped Crusader to justice once and for all. By obsessions lurk everywhere, and for some in this story, obsessions prove deadly.<br /><br />Doug Moench and Paul Gulacy do a great job of providing a dense, rich read. They also conspire to highlight this very dark work with some moments of bright, delightful comedy in such a way that is not out of place with the rest of the work.<br /><br />Some character highlights include the creation of the Batsignal, and further bonding between Gordon and Batman. Catwoman appears briefly throughout, but she seems out of place in the story, just flittering in and out without doing much at all.<br /><br />This volume could be enjoyed by a newcomer to the Batman mythos, or a veteran collector, but silhouetted nudity might not make it appropriate for very young children.<br /><br />Recommended.	2005-06-07

It's just the paintings, and they are a wonder to behold. Fabry's art is so fabulous, so realistic, so wonderful.<br /><br /> It also was supposed to contain details and comments by both Glenn Fabry himself, and the ever expressive Garth Ennis. However, I was slightly disappointed that both of them kept their comments so brief. Only a few of the covers have comments that actually shed any light on the series, other comments were `turn the page' or `I have nothing to say'.<br /><br />Also, this is just the covers. It contains no Preacher story material.<br /><br />So it's great if you're a fan of Fabry's, but if you're looking for something to read, or something that will give you great insight into the Preacher series, you might want to look elsewhere.	2005-06-06

I, Alien collects 27 original stories all drafted from the point of view of aliens, dealing with the odd and occasionally ogresome creature known as man. What could have been just another sci-fi anthology is entertaining and highly original. Some of the stories are pure magic. Diary of a Galactic `&Eacute;migr&eacute; by Laura Resnick kicks the volume off and is laugh out loud funny. Me by Mike Resnik points out that god may not be exactly what man thinks. You be Stephen Leigh is haunting, especially for those of us who read anthologies all the time. Anakoinosis by Tobias Bucknell makes us wonder what man's nature really is, and how we would fit into the nature of other planets.<br /><br />I am NOT a fan of sci-fi, normally, but I am the fan of a well written short story and this anthology is full of them. This is yet another delightful anthology by DAW, and well worth a read.	2005-06-05

With gritty, haunting art by Klaus Janson, Morrison tells a remarkable tale of Batman, Mr. Whisper, and sinister evil that has burned across continents for more than 300 years.<br /><br />Batman is still at the beginning of his crime fighting career, still coming into his own, when a mysterious madman named Mr. Whisper begins killing off mob bosses using poetry as a clue. Meanwhile, Batman is plagued by nightmares of his father with his lips sewn shut, trying to pass on some manner of clue to his son.<br /><br />Soon Batman is horrified to learn that Mr. Whisper is actually his old headmaster from an all boys school that nearly killed him as a child, and the madman might be older than that.<br /><br />Filled with occult lore, and mature topics, this Batman volume is more suited to older audiences, and parents might want to screen it before letting their children read it, but for those of us who have been Grant Morrison fans for a long time, please take the time to read and enjoy this lost treasure.<br /><br />This volume collects Legends of the Dark Knight #6-10.	2005-06-05

This one did. 787 pages of small print, detailed reference on almost every comic book printed from the beginning to 2003 when this was printed.<br /><br />What makes this so different from many of the offerings out there is that this book includes one shots and hard to find small press titles, not just books from Marvel or DC. Are you wondering about something Sirius, Fantagraphics, or even Kitchen Sink put out? This has you covered. Are you curious how many mini-series Wolverine has been in and what the background on those issues is? This book has you covered. It not only lists titles, it gives a description of what happened within a series and pinpoints key issues. What it does not do is give prices, but they're always Overstreet's Price Guide for that.<br /><br />I'm so impressed with mine I intend to get a few for presents for other comic book collecting friends. This is the perfect addition to any collectors library whether they're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer.<br /><br />For the newcomer it also provides a dictionary of comic book terminology.<br /><br />I just can't say enough about this wonderful book.

Rogue 3 in A New Hope, we know he was Luke's friend from Tatoonie that gave his life protecting Luke during the Battle of Yavin. This graphic novel, which collects Star Wars: Empire, issues #8-12 + #15, gives us Bigg's background, motives, and an in depth look at a fascinating man.<br /><br />This graphic chronicles Biggs from the time he was a youth on Tatoonie, until the fateful Battle of Yavin, with many interesting notes in between.<br /><br />Nor is this simply the tale of Biggs Darklighter. Luke Skywalker and \\"Hobbie\\" Klivian both have prominent roles.<br /><br />There is also a small series called \\"The Short, Happy Life of Roons Sewell\\". Originally printed as Empire #10-11, it is composed of Roons Swell's eulogy, delivered by General Dodonna. Though this eulogy and a series of flashbacks, we see Roons Sewell's path to becoming a hero of the Alliance, a haunting, interesting tale.<br /><br />Both these men had different lives, and took very different paths to becoming martyrs for the Alliance. Both men were brave and became icons of heroism.<br /><br />The writing is flawless, the art is bold, and the story haunting. Highly recommended.	2005-06-02

Books	5	4	4	N	N	So what DOES it feel to die?	So what does it feel like to die? According to author Greg Emmanuel, it all depends on how you go. 39 separate, horrible fates are chronicled in this book, and though not all of them end in death, they do all make your skin crawl. The categories include When Animals Attack, The Great Outdoors, Somebody Get a Doctor, Crime and Punishment, Everyday Mishaps, and Going to Extremes. Most of the scenarios only last for 2-3 pages which makes this a great book to pull out at parties and read aloud from, or take with you on vacation. The story style is conversational and informal, and the book length is a scant 175 pages, so it's a quick read all around.<br /><br />Yes, the stories are creepy and gross, and at times they'll make you laugh though you might feel a little guilty for doing so. This is a novel and fun book.	2005-06-01

This anthology is based on the premise of those relatives of literary characters we know and love. Many of the stories are written from the perspective of the relatives in fairly tales that are `the bad guy'. Most of these were especially entertaining.<br /><br />A full list of the stories includes....<br /><br />*** Home for the Holidays by Pauline Alma<br /><br />*** With a Face Only a Mother Could Love by Jenn Reese<br /><br />*** Switched by Nina Kiriki Hoffman<br /><br />*** The Trick of the Tricksters Tricked by Josepha Sherman<br /><br />*** Thrice Told by Von Jocks<br /><br />*** Dynasty by Bill McCray<br /><br />*** Serpent's Tooth by Susan and Bradley Sinor<br /><br />*** Mirror, Mirror by Jacey Bedford<br /><br />*** After the Ball by Pamela Luzier<br /><br />*** Peggy Plain by Devon Monk<br /><br />*** Heathcliff's Notes by David Bischoff<br /><br />*** Cuckoo's Egg by Jody Lynn Nye<br /><br />*** Rapunzel- The True Story by Robert Sheckley<br /><br />*** Among the Stars by Susan Sizemore<br /><br />*** King of Shreds and Patches by P.N. Elrod<br /><br />I found many of these stories to be original and entertaining. \\"Peggy Plain\\" by Devon Monk was especially entertaining with it's crime noir style superimposed on the world of nursery rhymes. \\" King of Shreds and Patches\\" by P.N. Elrord was another stand out tale, this set from the perspective of Claudius in Hamlet.<br /><br />The complaint I had about the collection was too many of the stories overlapped. For instance, Cinderella's tale receives several different treatments. With the vast scope of literary characters out there, I wish Denise Little would have encouraged the writers to broaden their scopes.<br /><br />Still, this is another highly entertaining, solid anthology by DAW.	2005-05-31

Warrior\\" shows Leia in the days just before Star Wars: A New Hope. Still a Senator, moving through the galaxy in her Blockade Runner, she's trying to bring aid to the fledgling Rebellion. Unfortunately for them and her, she's drawn too much attention. When faced with her first tastes of battle, Leia finds her values, character, and strength tested severely. This story also features Captain Antilles as a major character, a treat for die-hard fans.<br /><br />\\" A Little Piece of Home\\" takes place shortly after Star Wars: A New Hope. Leia's former boyfriend and his brother managed to escape the destruction of Alderaan because they were vacationing on a moon they owned. That moon would make an ideal Rebel base. But as she rekindles her feelings for Raal they find themselves in impossible circumstances, struggling for their lives. But that struggle is just as hard as Leia wining the respect of Raal's older brother, Heeth. Heeth and Raal are some of Leia's last connections to her home planet, will she loose them, too?<br /><br />\\" Alone Together\\" is 3 months after the Star Wars: A New Hope, and the fleet is adrift. Han, Chewie, Leia, and Deena Shan, a newcomer to the Rebellion. Deena is nursing a huge crush on Han Solo, but that's placed by the wayside when the four must answer a distress call on a distant planet. Easily my favorite story of the four, it's a funny, quick, entertaining lead.<br /><br />\\" A Valentines Story\\" takes place just before Empire Strikes Back. Leia, Han and Chewbacca are piloting two spacecraft to the new base at Hoth. Han and Leia are in one craft, Chewbacca in another. Caught in a storm as they try to land, they all crash, but after Han and Leia attempt to rescue Chewbacca they struggle together to survive. They also bond together in their own way. A touching and sweet tale in many ways.<br /><br />This graphic novel shows many aspects of Leia, and shows her growing up, as well as filling in some of the gaps between movies. Highly recommended for Star Wars fans or anyone interested in reading about a strong female lead character.rvive. They also bond together in their own way.

Martin Greenberg and Russell Davis assembled 13 stories using the stipulation that every holiday could be used except Halloween. The authors do a good job of finding creative ways to utilize the theme without being cheap or obvious.<br /><br />A full list of the stories is....<br /><br />For These Things I am Truly Grateful by David Wilson<br /><br />Jewels in the Dust by Peter Crowther<br /><br />Birthday Jitters by Julie E.

Hopkins<br /><br />As with every anthology a few stories stand out as jewels. \\" The Dead Don't Waddle\\" alone is worth the money to purchase the book. It's laugh out loud funny and unusual at the same time. \\" Season Finale\\" by Bradley Sinor was well written and twisted around so it was hard to guess the end. I enjoyed it immensely. I enjoyed most of the stories. They were well thought out an executed. My only complaints come in \\" The Secret Sympathy\\" by Hopkins and \\" Jewels in the Dust\\" I found overly sentimental and preachy at times. They are why I give this anthology 4 stars and not 5.<br /><br />Still, this anthology is a mix of both fantasy and horror with a dose of the unusual. Highly recommended.	2005-05-29

The result is a fun, fascinating read. Over all, the stories are fast paced and thrilling. Only a few stories lag compared to the others, but this anthology has far fewer weak points than other anthologies I've read through the years.<br /><br />A full list of the stories is as follows:<br /><br />*The Chaney Legacy by Robert Bloch<br /><br />*Soft Monkey by Harlan Ellison<br /><br />*Death on the Nile by Connie Willis<br /><br />*Menage a Trois by F.

The only thing Hulk/Wolverine is an example of is mediocrity and what NOT to do with a mini-series.<br /><br />Reprinting Hulk/Wolverine Six Hours #1-4, this graphic's script is as weak and anemic as Banner at his Ultimates' worst. With yet another boring somehow-this-hero-runs-into-another and supervillians follow plot, it was almost painful to read. Add to that the villain is named `Shredder' and though we've never seen him before or since, we're supposed to buy him as a credible threat to Wolverine. Yawn, but one look at the guy and you know Wolverine will tear him apart in seconds. Also, ignore the fact that there's more plot holes in this than all the multiple universe X-Men continuity combined. Without mentioning who, someone in here receives a blood transfusion from Bruce Banner. The last time this happened, the She-Hulk was created, yet there's no mention of that or any ill effects mentioned. Continuity headache anyone?<br /><br />The art is interesting in its own right and style for the most part, but again, it isn't breathtaking, or worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The covers by Simon Bisley are reprinted in this volume and are quite marvelous as is most of Bisley's work, marking one bright point in the volume.<br /><br />Also, Hulk #181 is reprinted, but it's included in other, more interesting volumes.<br /><br />Overall, skip this and read Frank Miller and Chris Claremont's Wolverine graphic, ISBN 087135277X, if you're looking for a good Wolverine story, or Hulk: Gray by Loeb and Sale, ISBN 0785113460 for a well done Hulk story.	2005-05-20

The second volume, which reprints Ultimates vol. 1 #7-13 of the comic book, expands that team, interaction, and then throws in a giant Independence Day style alien invasion.<br /><br />This volume allows us to see more of all the Ultimates in action, and also introduces Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver to name a few. We see more of Thor in action, as we barely saw him last volume. Also, Hulk makes a return to the team, in knock down, drag out, violent brawl that is absolutely brutal. The invading alien fleet and their host of on the ground operatives in the guise of Nazis from WWII make for a fresh foe for Captain America and team.<br /><br />This volume also shows more of the team coming together as a team, and interpersonal relationships shifting and changing.<br /><br />My only caution is that while this volume could stand alone, it is much easier to read and understand having read Ultimates vol. 1. Still, a great, fun addition to a graphic novel library.	2005-05-20

My second reaction was, \\" I hope this can live up to the hype\\". Not only did it live up to the hype, it blew it out of the water.<br /><br />Loeb and Lee begin Hush in this volume which collects Batman 608-612. The story doesn't begin with a whimper, but with a bang- a knock down, drag out fight between Batman and Killer Croc. Then, in a whirlwind Poison Ivy, Catwoman, huntress, Lois Lane, Superman, and the mysterious, bandaged Hush all build intrigue into this spectacular graphic.<br /><br />A few of the treasures I was particularly thrilled with were the flashbacks painted by Jim Lee depicting Bruce Wayne's childhood before the fateful gunshots that would change him into the Batman. Also, this graphic opens with a two page retelling of Batman's origin by the Hush crew.<br /><br />The only word of warning I have is since this is 1-5 of a 12 part story arc, vol. 1 will stop in the middle of the story.<br /><br />Hush is one of the great Batman stories and one of my personal favorites.	2005-05-17

Concluding the story line, Batman volume 2 assures this story will be counted with the great Batman stories, such as Killing Joke, Death in the Family, and Dark Knight. Last issue showcased familiar friends and enemies with new twists, the second volume is no exception. Harley Quinn, Joker, Harvey Dent, Jim Gordon, Barbara Gordon, Nightwing, Robin, Clayface, Talia, Ra's al Ghul, Lady Shiva, and a few cast members that come back from the dead are all present to wrap up this arc.<br /><br />As before, Jeff Loeb's stories and Jim Lee's pencils blend seamlessly together, presenting a well through out, roller coaster of a tale. At the end, Batman is left exposed and unsure, which is a nice twist on the normally confident Dark Knight.<br /><br />I can't tell much about the plot without giving away the whole thing. However, I will reveal the reason I only gave this volume 4 stars: the villain seemed too obvious to me. I had it guessed a few pages into volume 1 and unfortunately I was right. I was hoping to be surprised. Still, I look forward to the next time this particular villain and Batman fight again.<br /><br />This is yet another one of the Batman comics's Lazarus pits, magical transformations that bring the book from good to perfect.	2005-05-17
US	37492827	R2PKLGKLNZQAI8	0613667662	868401290	Fables 1 (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)	Books	5	12	12	N	N	A unique, fun take on fairy tales	Fables: Legends in Exile reprints the first 5 issues of the Vertigo Comics' series, Fables. The concept of the series is well done, original, and interesting. The classic fairy tale figures of legend were driven from their lands by a mysterious creature named \\"the Adversary\\". Left with no choice but leave their lands or die, the Fables fled to New York City, living in secret, judging, policing, and governing themselves.<br /><br />This volume centers around the question, ` Who murdered Rose Red?\\" The beloved sister of Snow White is violently murdered, her apartment soaked in blood, her body missing. Immediately Snow White, who is now the Deputy Mayor of the Fable community enlists the help of Bigby Wolf, who is now the Sheriff. Together, they sort through a very unusual list of suspects, including Bluebeard, Jack (of Jack and the Beanstalk), and Prince Charming himself.<br /><br />Personally, I love this volume and Willingham's take on the characters. Happy ever after rarely means just that, everyone has distinct personalities that are more mature and devolved than the original fairy tales had time to discuss, and the characters are flawed. It makes for a brilliantly fun read.<br /><br />The only word of caution I have is this story has adult language and sexual situations, so keep that in mind when determining appropriateness. But for every adult out there, this is a great, fun graphic to read, with nice art and an original prose story by Willingham \\" A Wolf in the Fold\\".	2005-05-17

Because of the brutal attack, the Phoenix is confused, scared, and lonely. Returning to the Xavier Institute in search of Scott, she finds that his heart now belongs to Emma Frost, the White Queen. Hurt by the rejection, both the Phoenix and Jean struggle for control of Jean's mind, body, and soul. Since the Phoenix can end all of creation, or easily destroy the Earth, the X-Men must battle their former teammate.<br /><br />One of the great strengths of this story is the wonderful characterization. Wolverine's quiet declaration of \\" I may look tough, Jeannie, but I'm getting tired of killing you\\" or Cyclops' face covered in tears as he remembers the love he had for his former wife are small examples of the touching, yet powerful moments sprinkled generously throughout this story. It is also not without fast paced, bloody battles.<br /><br />Another strength is the art! Greg Land's art is breathtaking. The painted, photo-realistic panels are a marvel. I found myself reading this through for the story, then going back to gaze at the art.<br /><br />There are only two downsides. One- you can only reawaken the Phoenix so many times without it loosing a little meaning and Two- I thought the overall product would have been vastly improved had the last page not been included.<br /><br />Overall, a very spectacular book which I highly recommend.	2005-05-03

While the quote is actually from a previous issue, those few words speak volumes for this, the latest Punisher graphic from Marvel Knights. Reprinting Marvel Knights Punisher issues #33-37, Confederacy of Dunces is the reuniting of Garth Ennis and John McCrea. This is the duo responsible for Hitman. Those of you who enjoyed Hitman will love this tome. It has a flippant irreverence for Superheroes that only the Ennis/McCrea duo could pull off.<br /><br />The plot forms around Spiderman, Daredevil, and Wolverine gathering in an attempt to reign in Punisher, who has wronged them all in one way or another. (See the first three Punisher graphics for full details and lots of naughty laughs). But Frank has his own secret weapon, a drugged up, enraged Hulk.<br /><br />This volume also sees the return of Spacker Dave, and a happy end for Detective Soap. What else can I say? Ennis is brilliantly wicked and funny in this one! McCrea's art is art and comedic at the same time! This graphic is a worth addition to any collection.	2005-04-30

He also reacquaints us old friends, including Wedge Antilles and Admiral Ackbar.<br /><br />For the most part, the novel is brilliant, fast paced, and fun, with several lightning fast fights. Because it is the first in a series and introduces so many new characters, the first half of the book deals primarily with character development and background. The second half settles in, blossoming into a thrilling plot.<br /><br />This volume could easily stand alone, but you don't have to settle for only one. There are 8 other books in the main series and I, Jedi also uses primarily Rogue Squadron characters.	2005-04-30

Union is easily one of the best Star Wars tales available for a number of reasons.<br /><br />1: The art is brilliant. Teranishi delivers a style that is a delightful mixture of photo-realism with enough of his own style to make it highly interesting. Not only do the characters from the movies look amazingly like the actors, but the characters that exist in novel form appear as described.<br /><br />2: The writing is Stackpole's best, and easily some of the best in the Star Wars universe. In some places it is absolutely hilarious. Several times I had to put the book down because I was laughing out loud. Stackpole has a way of capturing the quirky madness that surrounds a wedding and then weaves in the antics of the characters we know and love so well. The sub plot with the disenfranchised Imperials seemed to be a point of contention for other reviewers, but to me, it was insignificant compared to all the comedic delights this story has to offer.<br /><br />3: The over all characterizations that are a blend of writer and artist, that must be seen to be believed.<br /><br /> Not only does this novel sport appearances by most everyone in the Star Wars universe, it is fun, and funny, with a quick pace and fun rollicking feeling. Not only fans of Luke and Mara, fans of any and all Star Wars characters will love this novel.<br /><br />Highest recommendations!!!	2005-04-19

Being greedy I wanted more. For those of you who felt the same, this graphic is the answer.<br /><br />The premise: shortly before Epidode I, Darth Sidious dispatches Darth maul to cripple Black Sun, a vast criminal empire with sufficient power to threaten Sidious's plans. Maul proceeds to slaughter his way across the next 72 pages and most of the galaxy. One has to wonder how Marz is able to conceive of all the carious ways Mail slices and dices his way through the criminal underworld. My favorite method of murder is when a telepath tries to read Maul's mind and has a fatal stroke because all he can sense if pure, undiluted evil.<br /><br />This fits nicely into continuity for long time Star Wars fans, but it could easily stand alone for the curious who just want a one time fix of fun, and Sith mayhem. Over all a great book.	2005-04-13

Showcasing the origins of Cyclops and Storm (which are radically unlike the comic book versions), adds a fun element to the beginning of the book. Also many of the movies scenes were expanded in this format, which creates a fun `directors cut' feel for the fans that have seen the movie several times. Another strength is since so much has been changed from the comic, anyone can enjoy this book as a stand alone from the comics, or the movie quite easily.<br /><br />Now, the weaknesses. It feels as if Rusch and Smith, who normally are wonderful authors, suffered by receiving an early script that hadn't been revised. Many of the key scenes that made the movie so wonderful are changed, and not for the better. The result is that the characterizations suffer. The characterization of Logan suffers the most. The dialogue is wooden, and often, the writers take points that could have been done subtlety in one or two lines and beat the readers with them like a mallet. The worst mistake is when the according to the book, Wolverine extends the four Adamantium claws of his left hand... a wretched mistake for a casual fan to make, let alone an X-Men author.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is far better, and if you're looking for a fun X-Men read, there is a host of X-Men trade paper backs and graphic novels that would provide a much better reading experience.	2005-04-10
US	37492827	R99FEO33BVMAZ	0785111360	590801608	Wolverine Vol. 1: The Brotherhood	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Great for established fans and newcomers alike	Those of us that have been reading Wolverine for a while know very few things for certain about everyone's favorite Canadian X-Man, but two things we know for sure are 1. He hates cults, nazis, and bullies and 2. He has a soft spot for girls in trouble. These two elements clash in this graphic novel.<br /><br />When Lucy Braddock, the waitress at Logan's favorite caf&eacute; and his neighbor is murdered after asking for Logan's protection, he will not rest until he finds her killers. Tracking down the culprits with little more information than what kind of gun he was shot with, Logan proceeds to prove he is still the best there is at what he does, and what he does often is bloody.<br /><br />My favorite chapter is the last. After the blood bath of the previous issues, after Logan has to deal with physical pain, he meets Nightcrawler in a bar for a little soul searching. For long time fans, this issue was touching, harkening back to Claremont's run on X-Men, but with Greg Rucka's unique style.<br /><br />Speaking of style, Rucka's writing and Robertson's art provide a unique, gritty style. Both use a highly stylized approach that is still somehow very pleasant and not overdone.<br /><br />There's enough references to previous plot points in Wolverine's past to make established fans rejoice, cheer, and flinch, but a newcomer can easily pick this up and understand everything without having to spend extra on more books.<br /><br />Highest recommendations!	2005-03-28

It also combines two of the most popular creators in comic books today, Jeff Loeb and Tim Sale. Their other creations include Hulk: Gray, Daredevil: Yellow, and Batman: Dark Victory.<br /><br />In London, women are being murdered. Five have been killed so far. The manner in which they have been killed kindles rumors of Jack the Ripper's return. One of the victims, Alexandra Davies, was a former romance of Gambit's. When he arrives in London, he is shocked to learn that the murderer might be his friend and teammate Wolverine, who has been rapidly sinking into an animal state. Yet, things are rarely as they appear in the X-Men universe and this is no exception.<br /><br />Jeff Loeb and Tim Sale do a great job of delivering a intense murder mystery, and yet at the same time, delivering some very touching character development moments.<br /><br />The story is also a stand alone so it's easy access for new fans. Yet, established fans, do not fear, there's enough references to events in the X-Men's past that keep us riveted.<br /><br />A brilliant book all around.	2005-03-28

In this, the first of the Hellboy graphic novel series, Mike Mignola introduces us to the BPRD, including Hellboy, Liz Sherman and Abe Sapien. Ancient gods, mad Russians, and frog demands provide the foils to our heroes.<br /><br />As always, Mignola's visuals are stunning in their beauty and simplicity. The script was provided by John Bryne who's other work encompasses everything from Fantastic Four to Superman. These two factors combine to create an aesthetically delicious book.<br /><br />Also, fans of the Hellboy movie will recognize many elements in this book, as it was one of the graphics that the movie was based on.<br /><br />Over all this will probe a valuable addition to your collection. Highly recommended.	2005-02-15

The stories contained in this graphic have visuals that are breathtaking, and a storyline that's haunting. It's worth the price of admission for this thrill ride.<br /><br />In this collection of short stories Mike Mignola, Ryan Sook, Christopher Golden, Tom Sniegoski, Brian McDonald, Derek Thompson, Matt Smith and other tap into the wonderful, magical world of the BPRD. Though set in the same world as Hellboy, don't expect your favorite red skinned, cigar smoking Right Hand of Doom in this compilation other than a few small cameos.<br /><br />Who will you see? Abe Sapien shines bright in most of the stories. Roger, Liz, Johann Kraus, and Lobster Johnson all make this a great read filled with paranormal thrills and chills that include a brain with a mind of its down, a swarm of sharks with a desire for human flesh and the power to bring that flesh directly to them, and an underground tribe of creatures who have set out to destroy human life.<br /><br />Also included in this compilation are hard to find extras such as sketches and a 3 page teaser originally published in Dark Horse Extra.	2005-02-15

These issues take place during Frank Miller's long and glorious reign on his seminal book. His hard hitting writing, and gritty, crime noir art style (with a heavy assist by the brilliant Klaus Janson) are definitely present in this volume. Punisher, long before his overexposure in the 90's, is cold blooded, ruthless, and absolute, much the way he is now, in his Marvel Knights and Max issues.<br />Yet, the reason this book receives four stars instead of the full five, is the pure power of both these characters is lost in the quagmire of an overly preachy plot. Focusing on the inherent evils of drugs, namely `angel dust', the story becomes trite, and sadly at the end, predictable.<br />Do not let this be your one and only exposure to Frank Miller's run on Daredevil. Several graphics, including the Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller showcase his talent so much better. Especially recommended is Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller volume 2 ISBN: 0-7851-0771-1.	2004-06-25

Covering Marvel Knights Punisher issues #13-18, Punisher: Business as Usual is one of the strongest offerings from the series of Punisher novels. Ennis is at the height of his scripting power on this series.<br />#13 and #14 chronicles Punisher on an unlikely mission of mercy to rescue a hostage in South America. For those of you that are rolling your eyes and groaning, this isn't a return to Punisher's War Journal days. This is a crazy Ennis thrill ride filled with twists, turns, and improbabilities.<br />#15 is the tale of a reporter willing to do whatever it takes to get the story, even if that's making a deal with the devil, or handcuffing himself to the Punisher to see what Frank does on a typical night. With Detective Soap's life in the balance, the Punisher must decide what is good and what is evil...<br />#16 and #17 are what this series if all about. The Mob, Wolverine, midgets, and a series of unfortunate events. I don't want to give too much away, but please, read these two issues at least a couple of times. The second time, pay attention to the facial expressions. Robertson does a brilliant job that has to be seen to be believed!<br />In #18 Ennis spotlights his home territory of Ireland, sending the Punisher across the pond. Here we see what `pointless' violence really is.<br />The bottom line is if you are a fan of Punisher, Wolverine, Ennis, or Robertson, then please take the time and money to get this book. You won't be sorry!	2004-06-22

It's by no means the weakest offering, or the strongest. This is mostly due to the hodgepodge of art work. Three artists contribute- Steve Dillion, of Punisher, Preacher, and Hellblazer fame, Cam Kennedy- former Judge Dredd artist, and Tom Mandrake- Spectre, Call of Duty. Dillion's art provides the faming issues, and perhaps this is a mistake. We go from his crisp style to Mandrake's art, which tends to look like Tim Sale's of late. Then Cam Kennedy provides most of the art. While I enjoy Cam's work on other books, I felt as if it were less than perfect for this character, this story.<br />Speaking of stories, the writing is deep, dark, disturbing and wonderfully funny all at the same time. Only Garth Ennis can pull that off with any regularity at all. Any fan of Ennis should love adding this volume to their collection.<br />On a personal note, my two favorite stories were #19, which marks the return of Joan (and Joan's pies) and #32 which is the dubious origin of Detective Soap. The volume is worth adding to your collection for these two stories alone. When reading #19 note that the expressions on Frank's face and Frankie the Dog's face are often the same.<br />Over all, a very good book that is well worth the money. Highest recommendations!	2004-06-22

It uses the pilot as a basis for this story, and yes, a few clips of dialog are exact, but there is much more than could be aired.<br />Much of Angel's love story is given, painful background that lead to him having to leave. The reader is also treated to a deeper insight as to how painful that breakup was for Angel to endure. We were also given a glimpse into his creation (although this story differs slightly from the one that was later given in the television series) and we are treated to some new, previously unmentioned exploits of SPIKE and DRU, back when they bathed the world in blood.<br />The title of the book is Angel, so unfortunately, we see little of Doyle, but we are shown a tad bit more of Cordy. Still many of the Buffy/Angel characters appear, even Jenny Calendar, Willow, Darla, the Master, Giles, Xander, and more.<br />A worthy investment for the details that are included in the book, but not the television show.	2004-05-10

Welcome Back, Frank is a bone crunching, blood letting, teeth shattering thrill ride that hits you between the eyes with all the intensity of a sledgehammer.<br />This series marks Frank Castle's return to the `basics' of being the Punisher. For those fans lucky enough to miss the years that came before this one, let's just say that Frank had been lost in a whirlpool of hero hype and bad characterization during the 90's comic book boom.<br />But all that ended here with this series thanks to the Garth Ennis and Steve Dillion. Not only did they breathe fresh life into the Punisher, they introduced such delightful foils for him as Joan, Spacker Dave, Mr. Bumpo, and of course the Russian. The fight between Frank and the Russian alone is worth the cost of the book. That fight is just one example of how Ennis and Dillion remind us that Frank is a man, without powers. He can be hurt, and often is. The only thing that keeps him going is the rage and pain that gnaw his every nerve, every second of every day.<br />His is the series that the 2004 Punisher movie is based on. Do yourself a favor and add this book to your collection right away!	2004-04-20

Or I should say that there are few that don't a version of the story. There are as many different versions of the tale as there are people in Jersey. Some say that she had so many children, she wished her last one was a devil, and her wish came true. Some say that something scared the poor woman so much that she gave birth to a monster.<br />This is a book that examines all aspect of the legend with pictures, carvings, and articles that date back to the first mentions of the demonic beast in the 1800's. It offers many articles, sketches, and photos that are unique to this volume.<br />Perhaps my only complaint is that it's a bit thin. I would have liked more.<br />But still it's a great addition to your library whether you're from Jersey, like Mythology, or history.	2004-02-10

Though this book was first written in the late 1970's, Which Witch is a delight for fans of JK Rowling's Harry Potter novels. Much like Rowling, Ibbotson introduces colorful characters that are easy to root for, or against.<br />The entire novel centers around Arriman the Awful, the Wizard of the North. He has a long, wonderful career until he grows tired and longs for someone to take over for him. But since a suitable replacement can't be found, he's confronted with the fact that the only way to get an heir is to marry a witch and create one himself.<br />The problem is that all the witches in Todcaster are horrible ugly, except one, who has been cursed with the fact she is a white witch that can only do good magic! (the horror). Since Arriman wants a baby who can take over being bad for him, poor Belladonna knows she can't win. The witches must complete for Arriman's hand. Whoever does that darkest magic wins. The problem is that the moment Belladonna sees Arriman for the first time she loves him completely. Will she be able to be evil in time?<br />Though in bottled genie, a troubled orphan, a plucky earthworm, and an evil enchantress and you have wonderful mix.<br />But don't discount this as just a children's book. While children will have a lot of fun with it, adults will have even more fun!	2004-02-03

Buffy finds herself in the most frightening role of her life, trying to be a good mother to Dawn, while still finding time to battle the forces of evil.<br />Meanwhile Xander treats Anya to a Star Trek movie marathon, but when one of Xander's friends busts in, intent on killing everyone, it seems that the hell mouth has opened again. But Xander discovers that instead he is dealing with a new Virtual Reality system most of his friends are testing, and the virtual reality is far too real.<br />Shortly after Tara and Giles attend a taping of Tara's favorite TV psychic, and can only watch helplessly as he's attacked by supernatural forces.<br />Over all this is a very well written addition to the Buffy the Vampire Slayer series. Mel Odom continues to be my favorite author. It's fun to see how all his diverse plots will intermingle at the end.<br />For all you MANY Spike fans out there, while he doesn't get as much 'screen time' as Xander in this particular novel, he is strong, compassionate towards Buffy, and riding around on a motorcycle. Yum.<br />Lastly, for those of us that are comic book fans as well as Buffy fans there are more comic book and RPG references in here than you can shake an adamantium claw at. :><br />Highly recommended for fans not only of Buffy, but of Xander, Spike, and gaming!	2004-01-27

Books	5	13	13	N	N	Deceptively simple, wonderfully captivating	After being a fan of Karl Edward Wagner's Year's Best Horror anthologies for DAW publishing I decided to give this anthology a try. Though I confess that I didn't realize all the stories in the tome were penned by Wagner himself. However, it was a very pleasant turn of events. The horror contained in these stories is subtle and insidious. Within the first few pages you're completely hooked. This book is hard to put down. The characterization is such that you find yourself wanting to know what happens to these people. The plot is winding and intriguing.<br />I'd like to be able to tell you \\" If you're a fan of so and so author you'll enjoy this book,\\" but I can't do that. Wagner is unlike any other horror writer. His style is refreshing and just different enough to completely stand out.<br />If you have a chance, snap up this out of print gem.

They're divided into 3 sections, Where Were You When the Lights Went Out, Coping With the Dead, and End Games.<br />Some of the more well known authors that contribute original stories are Poppy Z.

Even the team of Spector and Skipp contribute a very chilling tale of what love means to those who are no longer alive.<br />All the stories are memorable and all will leave that creepy taste of wormy flesh somewhere in the back of your throat. I highly recommend this book for horror fans looking for something different, but it is an absolute must have for fans of George R. Romero's brilliant trilogy.	2003-12-01

Many of the stories presented in this anthology are wonderful, new, and original in every way. There are some takes on the `Living Dead' mythos that many of us haven't thought of before, such as love among Zombies, being the last few survivors, etc.<br />A list of the stories and authors are:<br />Blossom by Chan McConnell<br />Mess Hall by Richard Laymon<br />It Helps if You Sing by Ramsey Campbell<br />Home Delivery by Steven King<br />Wet Work by Philip Nutman<br />A Sad Last Love at the Diner of the Damned by Edward Bryant<br />Bodies and Heads by Steve Rasnic Tem<br />Choices by Glen Vasey<br />The Good Parts by Les Daniels<br />Less Than Zombie by Douglas E.

Romero, and Zombie flick fans. It is a MUST have for Night of Living Dead fans. The only reason that it gets 4 stars and not 5 is that Choices is unnecessarily long, boring and convoluted. It detracts from the overall anthology, but if you skip it and read the rest you will be very pleased!	2003-11-23

While the Brothers Grimm, Ellen Datlow and even Disney have all made gallant attempts at telling these classic morality stories, no one can hold a candle to James Finn Garner's brilliant masterpiece.<br />The fairytales presented in this volume include Little Red Riding Hood, The Emperor's New Clothes, The Three Little Pigs, Rumplestiltskin, The Three Codependent Goats Gruff, Rapunzel, Cinderella, Goldilocks, Snow White, Chicken Little, The Frog Prince, Jack and the Beanstalk, and the Pied Piper of Hamlin.<br />While all the stories are wonderful, Cinderella and the Frog Prince stand out and are my favorites. Read these two first!<br />While these stories are great if you just curl up and read them by yourself, they're even better when read aloud with a big group of your friends! But whatever you do, don't read these right before bedtime as the title suggests. You'll be laughing to hard to ever get to sleep.<br />These stories are suitable for children, but even more fun for adults. This book gets my highest recommendations.	2003-11-03

That headline gives you an idea of the types of stories that you'll find in this volume. 36 stories deal with Tabloid headlines and manage to create brilliant stories revolving around those scourges of supermarket shelves.<br />Of the 36 authors that make an appearance, some of the more famous are Laura Resnick, John DeChance, Thomas Monteleone, Alan Dean Foster, Greg Cox, Esther Friesner, Jody Lynn Nye, and Mike Resnick.<br />Of the 36 stories, the best by far are The Bride of Bigfoot by Lawrence Watt-Evans, the wonderfully delightful tale of one Bigfoot's search for true love. Royal Tiff Yields Face of Jesus, by Esther Friesner, a story about Charles and Dianna that turned out to be a little too close to the truth in some ways, and Stop Press by Mike Resnick a brilliant bit of fun that details just how hard it is to make up those silly headlines.<br />The only reason this volume gets 4 out of 5 stars and not the full five is because some of the stories really drag and could have been left out. But the clinkers are few and far between. Over all this is a really great anthology!	2003-11-03

Once again, the Horror Writers of America have banded together to produce an anthology of superior quality. As always, the entire anthology is centered around a central theme. This time it revolves around Dry Plains International, an airport where things happen. What kind of things? Grisly murders, viral outbreaks, demonic attacks, terrorist action, and even planes falling out of the sky.<br />There are 29 stories by different authors. Some of the more famous authors represented in this work are Brain Hodge, Nancy Kilpatrick, Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, and the editor, Ramsey Cambell.<br />As with any anthology a great many of the stories are well through out and well written, with only a few duds sprinkled throughout. My only complaint about the anthology over all was that a great many of the stories had endings that weren't really endings, a pet peeve of mine. If that's a pet peeve of yours as well, be forewarned.<br />Over all, though, this is a good book, and well worth the money.	2003-10-22

This is yet another one of the quirky, fun anthologies with all original tales about the Greek Gods. Some of the stories are serious, and some are just plain fun! For example in Tayna Huff's brilliant story February Thaw, Demeter must try to reconcile Persephone and Hades when they have a lover's quarrel, or the entire world can be doomed to eternal summer. Some stories deal with more serious matters such as Flight by Jane Yolen, a stirring story about a child's quest to ride Pegasus.<br />There are 17 stories in all, including<br />Drown Night With the Hope of Day by Nina Kiriki Hoffman<br />The Littlest Maenad by Esther Friesner<br />Flight by Jane Yolen<br />Mantrik Rites by Jon DeCles<br />Harpies Discover Sex by Deborah Wheeler<br />In the Quiet After Midnight by Charles de Lint<br />The Sword of Herakles by Irene Radford<br />To Hades and Back by Karen Haber<br />In Re: Nephelegeretes by Lawrence Watt-Evans<br />Hekate's Hounds by Diana Paxson<br />The Arrows of Godly Passion by Resnick and DiChario<br />Traps by Jo Clayton<br />February Thaw by Tanya Huff<br />The Third Song by Roberta Gellis<br />For a Transcript, Send Five Dollars by Anne Braude<br />Kin by Michelle West<br />The Divine Comedy by Dennis McKiernan<br />I highly recommend this book to fans of fantasy fiction, fans of Greek mythology, anthology fans, or just people who like fun, original fiction.

A masterful mix of seven radically different stories about Camelot, this anthology makes itself stand out from all the other books in a few ways. One way is that very few of these stories feature Arthur in the very traditional \\"Excalibur\\" type of way. If you've read a lot about the legend and want a change, this book would be a good choice for you. If you like a very traditional style of Arthurian story, than by the book for \\"The Feasting of the Hungry Man\\" by Ian McDowell. A bloody brilliant story that stars Mordred, it's a true gem and one of the reasons I gave this book as many starts as I did.<br />The seven stories the book features are:<br />· The Raven's Quest by Fiona Patton- a wonderful story with a very 'fairytale' feel to it.<br />· The Queen's Broidery Woman by Nancy Springer- a small familiarity with Greek or Roman myth might be helpful with this one.<br />· The Architect of Worlds by Brian Stableford- is a nice little story about Merlin and Morgana.<br />· The Bridge of Fire by Mike Ashley- features a few lesser known knights defending Lancelot when he is accused of infidelity with the Queen.<br />· The Feasting of the Hungry Man by Ian McDowell- this is  my favorite from this anthology. The writing is great and the characters fun. You have to give this one a read!<br />· Builder of Keeps by Gregory Maguire- is another look a Merlin and Morgana's role in Camelot.<br />· The Sword of the North by Rosemary Edghill- is a Native American look at Camelot.<br />A few of the stories drag but all and all it's worth purchasing!	2003-09-22

There are few who don't know the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. However, this version is a bit different than the one you might be use to. For example, it's Arthur's sister Morgause that bares his son Mordred, not Morgana Le Fay. Arthur wields the sword Caliburn, not Excalibur.<br />This book divides the legend of Arthur into seven chapters, each spotlighting a different character. It's a fun, visually exciting way to present the story. Though out the book are woven with haunting, alluring paining and sketches, making this a feast for your eyes.<br />Be warned, there is sexual content, but not much. Still, I recommend this book for those 14 and older.<br />Just a side bar, if you buy this book and do like it, it's one of a series called \\"Enchanted World\\", so make sure you look up it's 19 siblings!	2003-09-15

On the surface, Invitation to Camelot may seem like just another collection of short stories about King Arthur and Camelot. However, this book is well worth the price. All the stories it contains are decent, and a few sparkle as some of my favorite short stories of all time.<br />Morgan Llywelyn's story \\"Their Son\\" is one of the most brilliant short fictions ever, and well worth the price of the book. It's ending is such a sharp twist it will leave your head spinning. Also Jane Yolen's \\"Meditation in a Whitethorn Tree\\" shows us why she is one of the most celebrated fiction writers ever. A must read for Guinevere and Merlin fans alike.<br />The other stories featured are<br />· The Storyteller by Jane Yolen- a nice little poem<br />· The Minstrel's Tale by Tanith Lee<br />· Two Bits of Embroidery by Phyllis Ann Karr- another great story. This one has Sir Kay, a personal favorite character<br />· The Camelot Connection by Elizabeth Ann Scarborough<br />· Uallannach by Parke Godwin<br />· Seven from Caer Sidi by Susan Shwartz<br />· The Vow that Binds by Gregory Frost<br />· Nimue's Tale by Madeline E Robins<br />· Night Mare by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro<br />· The Palace by Moonlight by Sharan Newman<br />· Winter Solstice, Camelot Station by John M.

It took me a while to get to this one. I was thinking that this would be just another \\"girl power\\" anthology with cookie cutter female vampires. I'm glad that I was wrong.<br />The 14 stories featured in this anthology is full of unique, engaging female vampires. Not all the vampires are your typical Dracula cape and fang types. Some want a bit of your soul instead, some harvest the dead, and some aren't even easily recognizable as women, actually.<br />Most of the stories will have you hungering for more. The only one I really was bored with was Song of the Night People by Larry Niven. This is actually the first part of a novel and should have been left out of this anthology. It's 50 pages and doesn't really have any ending at all, so you don't know what happens unless you buy the book.<br />Still, if you want something different than the \\"normal\\" Dracula vampires and feel like reading something smart, funny, and original, than pick up a copy of this classic anthology.	2003-09-05

When I first saw this book I was amused, but doubted that I would find any really good horror inside. The first two stories were pretty dreadful, and not in a good way. But once I start a book, I can't put it down so I kept reading. I'm glad that I did.<br />Once you get past the first few stories, this book is full of some very good horror stories that just happen to involve the White House or the office of President. But the stories themselves are well crafted and terrifying. Some of the best are:<br />Night of the Vegetables by Edward Lee- this story was so funny that I was laughing out loud. Not a very scary story, but great, nonetheless.<br />Creature Congress by Terry Beatty and Wendi Lee- Do not pass up this story! It has some great dialog and is good horrific fun.<br />Jack Be Quick by Graham Masterson is go good and spooky that it is now one of my favorite horror stories of all time. One of the best and most original takes on the JFK assassination that I have ever read.<br />This anthology contains 16 short stories by a wide range of authors. So if you're looking for a smart, fun horror anthology, give White House Horrors a try. You won't be disappointed.	2003-06-30

A quick summary<br />Issue 7: Lusiphur decides to try his hand at stealing from high society. As he poses as a rich foreign landowner, he meets a very wealthy woman who falls in love with him. But things get complicated when he decides to see what kind of treasure waits in her private parlor...<br />Issue 8: A dream demon offers Lusiphur a mental vacation by letting the young elf dream his greatest dreams. What Lusiphur doesn't know is this will make him insane so the demon can feed off his soul. What the demon doesn't know is that Lusiphur is just plain mean when he's cornered...<br />Issue 9: A doppelhanger comes to feed off Lusiphur's soul (he must not have seen what happened to the dream demon). When the demon assumes the form of Lusiphur's best friend there is hell to pay.<br />Issue 10: A departure from regular continuity, Lusiphur sits in a bar waiting for a storm to clear and tells the patrons the sad tale of two twins, doomed to unhappiness.<br />Issue 11: Yet another dream, or should I say nightmare.

If you're looking at getting a copy of Poison Elves: Requiem for an Elf because you're only familiar with Drew's comics at Sirius, than definitely buy this book. If you're looking to replace your copy that you've read time and time again until it was in nothing but tatters, I don't need to convince you, but for everyone else out there, you just have to own a copy of this book.<br />Poison Elves follows the story of Lusiphur Amerellis Malache, a raven-haired elf that grew up on the streets. From an early age he learned how to fight, steal, and kill just to survive. Now 19 in elf years, or roughly 133 in human years, he's on the run from the law yet again.<br />This graphic reprints the first six issues of I, Lusiphur which was Poison Elves original name. The first two comics are redone in prose form in this graphic. Don't skip over them. Drew is great with his prose and there's all sorts of good stuff in there.<br />In Issue One and Two Lusiphur meets a villainous necromancer that captures the Elf, and ripps out Lusiphur's eye in order to raise the demon Six-Tell Amalah. Luse escapes and goes to the healer Lirilith, a beautiful elf that is his best friend, and she manages to heal him in just in time, because someone has to die, either Six-Tell Amalah or Lusiphur and the demon is immortal....<br />In book three Lusiphur is injured once more, and is crawling through the woods when a kindly old man takes him in and helps him heal. But nothing is as it ever appears in the Poison Elves world...<br />In book 4 we first meet the blond elf Jace, or Jason. Pay attention to his cameo, he'll play a very important role later. This is also the first appearance of the Purple Marauder. He's far and away one of the best villains ever. You'll see what I mean<br />Book 5 and 6 has Luce stealing a very powerful gem, not because he wants to, but because of a life debt years and years old...<br />If you like you comics edgy, and filled with action, black comedy, and a kickin' good time than stop reading this and buy the book!than stop reading this and buy the book!	2003-06-30

No other Lobo story produced holds a candle to Lobo: The Last Czarnian. Keith Giffen and Alan Grant's dialog is inspired as well as laugh out loud hilarious. Simon Bisley's artwork is amazing. It's truly his best art, and some of the best art ever published by DC.<br />The story is deceptively simple. Lobo must transport Mz. Tribb- his 4th grade teacher and author of his scathing unauthorized biography- to Vril Dox. Lobo has promised to deliver Mz. Tribb alive, and Logo never breaks a promise. The worst news is Lobo would like nothing more than to kill his former schoolteacher. He vents his homicidal rage in a series of hilarious adventures. Four comic books are reprinted in this volume and by the end of book 2, Lobo is being hunted by<br />The Legion of Decency- psychotic, tea-sipping grannies out for blood<br />A convoy of space truckers -their leader is an Elvis impersonator<br />The Sons of Lobo- biker Lobo wannabes<br />Oneida Police Swat Team- who want to kill Lobo after he kills their police chief<br />Storm Troupers of the Pan-Galactic Demolition Dance Company- desperate to pay Lobo back for upstaging them during their chainsaw ballet.<br />During his adventures Lobo also runs afoul of the Orthography Commandos, a group of hooded literacy loonies that hold lethal spelling bees.<br />This story was far ahead of it's time. Originally published back in 1990, it's every bit as relevant, irreverent, and hilarious today as the day it was published.<br />---Also, a must have for Garth Ennis fans!---	2003-06-23

Time and time again I reread Cassidy: Blood and Whiskey, and it's easily one of my favorite comic books ever. Why? Well, it stars Cassidy, an Irish vampire who would rather have a pint of beer instead of a pint of blood. He's also one of those characters that says exactly what the reader would like to say in the same situation. Some of his one liners are great for use with friends (and enemies).<br />In this adventure Cassidy goes to New Orleans and meets another vampire, who thinks that Anne Rice is the authority on how all vampires should act. This other vampire, Eccarius, is going to be condemned to eternal life as a boring, self righteous jerk unless Cassidy can set him strait.<br />With deliciously powerful scripting by Garth Ennis; flowing, delicious art by Steve Dillion; and a gut wrenching twist ending every Preacher or Ennis fan should have this book.<br />By the way, look for a cameo by fan favorite Neil Gaiman as \\"Roger\\" a Goth follower of Eccarius.<br />NOTE: With nudity, extreme bad language, various other sins, this book is not for the young or easily offended.	2003-06-23

They are both Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter fans. Both were expecting Legolas or maybe Dobby, but neither are to be found here.<br />What is found is this anthology is all manners of elves from all kinds of mythology. From the tiny fairies of England, to the leprechauns of Ireland, to the thin, elegant, trickster elves of Norse mythology- this anthology has it all.<br />Out of the 19 stories contained in this novel, some of the more famous authors are Andre Norton, Tanya Huff, Jody Lynn Nye, and Michelle West. Out of all the stories, the best by far is  All That Glitters by C.J. Henderson, a dark fantasy story guaranteed to chill you to your marrow.<br />So I recommend this book for fans of Daw and Martin Greenberg anthologies, but if youre looking for a Lord of the Rings anthology, try After the King, ISBN: 0765302071.	2003-06-23

This other vampire, Eccarius, is going to be condemned to eternal life as a boring, self righteous wanker unless Cassidy can set him strait. <br />With deliciously powerful scripting by Garth Ennis; flowing, delicious art by Steve Dillion; and a gut wrenching twist ending every Preacher or Ennis fan should have this book. <br />By the way, look for a cameo by fan favorite Neil Gaiman as \\"Roger\\" a Goth follower of Eccarius. <br />NOTE: With nudity, extreme bad language, various other sins, this book is not for the young or easily offended.	2003-06-17

A very good companion to any Lobo collection, Lobo's Greatest Hits contains bits and clips from tons of Lobo appearances throughout the DCU, as well as new material.<br />During a storyline that has Lobo chase a white Rabbit (the car, not the animal) into a black hole, we revisit moments in Lobo's life. Some of the comic books that have clips presented are: L.E.G.I.O.N., Justice League International, Omega Men, Mister Miracle, Superman, and Adventures of Superman. In the back of the book is a complete list of these series along with issue numbers of the certain ones used.<br />If you're a devoted Lobo fan, but the graphic for the original material, some of it's pretty funny. Still, chase down the actual comic books mentioned and read the entire book. By presenting only a few pages from each book the editors are neutering the Main Man as badly as Vril Dox did!<br />Overall, though, this is a good graphic and starting out place for new fans. However, if you are a new fan and don't already own a copy of Lobo: the Last Czarnian, rush out and grab one now! It's far better than this one!	2003-06-16

No other Lobo story produced holds a candle to Lobo: The Last Czarnian. Keith Giffen and Alan Grant's dialog is inspired as well as laugh out loud hilarious. Simon Bisley's artwork is amazing. It's truly his best art, and some of the best art ever published by DC. <br />The story is deceptively simple. Lobo must transport Mz. Tribb- his 4th grade teacher and author of his scathing unauthorized biography- to Vril Dox. Lobo has promised to deliver Mz. Tribb alive, and Logo never breaks a promise. The worst news is Lobo would like nothing more than to kill his former schoolteacher. He vents his homicidal rage in a series of hilarious adventures. Four comic books are reprinted in this volume and by the end of book 2, Lobo is being hunted by<br />The Legion of Decency- psychotic, tea-sipping grannies out for blood<BR>A convoy of space truckers -their leader is an Elvis impersonator<BR>The Sons of Lobo- biker Lobo wannabes<BR>Oneida Police Swat Team- who want to kill Lobo after he kills their police chief<BR>Storm Troupers of the Pan-Galactic Demolition Dance Company- desperate to pay Lobo back for upstaging them during their chainsaw ballet.<br />During his adventures Lobo also runs afoul of the Orthography Commandos, a group of hooded literacy loonies that hold lethal spelling bees. <br />This story was far ahead of it's time. Originally published back in 1990, it's every bit as relevant, irreverent, and hilarious today as the day it was published. <br />---Also, a must have for Garth Ennis fans!---	2003-06-13

Because I'm a huge fan of Spike, I knew that I had to find a copy of this rare graphic. I'm very glad that I did. It contains 3 reprinted stories, and 1 original story.<br />ALL'S FAIR- takes place during the World's Fair of 1933. The story follows Spike and Dru as they maim. Slash, and slay their way through the glitter and lights of the Fair. They also encounter hideous demons from another dimension and highly skilled assassins out for blood.<br />THE QUEEN OF HEARTS- As the pair travel to Sunnydale to be near the Hellmouth, the star-crossed lovers stop in St. Louis to do a bit of gambling and cause major mayhem on a riverboat casino. But, their blissful vacation is cut short by river demons.<br />PAINT THE TOWN RED- this story takes place shortly after Spike and Dru leave Sunnydale at the end of Buffy's second season. Dru's renewed love for Angel drives a wedge between the lovers. The end result is both of them trying to hurt the other as much as possible- which is a whole lot! With James Marsters helping with the writing, and Ryan Sook's artwork, this is by far the best story of all four.<br />WHO MADE WHO- tells the tale of Spike and Dru's final break up in Brazil. This is an epilog to Buffy's season three episode \\" Lover's Walk\\".<br />The only downside to this graphic is the artwork. Highly stylized, it's a deterant to fans who like Spike for his rugged good looks.<br />Still, if you like Buffy, Dru, or Spike and can find a copy of this graphic, than by all means buy it!	2003-06-13

Overall, I was very pleased with the book. I figured I could break up the highlights the following way: the good, the bad, and the ugly.<br />The Good:<br />* The story moves quite well and is engaging, after all it does involve Jack the Ripper :><br />* The characters for the most part stay very true to the television series.<br />* It's got very cool sequences with Spike, Drusilla, Angelus and Darla that take place in London a hundred years ago. Those alone are worth the price of admission.<br />The Bad:<br />* There are lots of typos and wrong page headings. They're really distracting.<br />* This book should not be in the 'young readers' section of the store! With the amount and variety of sex in this book, it's not appropriate for anyone under 15.<br />The Ugly:<br />* The relationship between Buffy and Spike is so messed up that it's painful (for them and the readers).<br />So if you need a Buffy fix now that the show is cancelled, and you're looking for a book that stays pretty true to the show, then grab this book. After all, it's has Spike! :>	2003-06-08

It has a variety of stories, some better than others. They include:<br />* Succession by Tanya Huff- ****One of the best stories in this novel, it shows that magic exacts a price, especially when one is greedy*****<br />* The Voice of Authority by Jody Lynn Nye<br />* Beneath the Eye of the Hawk by Jane Lindskold<br />* A Light in the Desert by Rosemary Edghill<br />* The Scroll of Wisdom by Josepha Sherman<br />* Whatever was Forgotten by Nina Kiriki Hoffman<br />* Let Our People Go by Michey Zucker Reichert<br />* To See Beyond the Darkness by Bill McCay<br />* A Lion Set Loose Upon the World by Brendan DuBois **** Not only one of the best stories in this novel, it's a chilling horror story featuring the Lion goddess Sekhmet****<br />* Games of Fate by Fiona Patton<br />* The Spin Wizard by Laura Resnick ****This story is laugh out loud funny!****<br />* That God Won't Hunt by Susan Sizemore **** Susan Sizemore delights again in what is my favorite story in the book!

Delicate and intricate as hand woven lace, or a black widow's web, Dreams of Decadence is a work of art. 21 stories and 19 poems expose us to the eternal night of the vampire, but these are not typical Anne Rice vampires or cookie cutter Count Draculas. Every single story gives us some variation on the undead mythos. This anthology contains vampires that are very ancient and some newly born; vampires made by birth, virus, and even bites; vampires that can walk during the day and some that can only come out at night.<br />If you wish only to read about the vampires featured in popular role playing games and television series, or the vampire of the Anne Rice mythos, then look elsewhere. However, if you want a wide variety of thrilling, beautiful, and interesting tales than know that the cost of this book is a small price to pay for this gossamer glimpse into the midnight realm.	2003-05-26

I bought this novel after reading Dark Tyrants, also by White Wolf Publishing. It was a good, solid vampire anthology that you didn't have to be a gamer to enjoy.<br />I assumed When Will You Rage would be more of the same. I assumed wrong.<br />Editor Stewart Wieck assembled a menagerie of stories whose sole purpose seems to be using jargon exclusive to the game, while showcasing the writers' favorite (or their own) game characters. All in all this reads more like a fanzine than a professionally published anthology. Most of the stories are either 'average' or 'so-so' and at best are 'very good'. I would recommend that only players of Werewolf: the Apocalypse buy this novel and that people looking for a well-balanced werewolf anthology look elsewhere.	2003-05-17

But what else could it be with two of the greatest comic book professionals ever teaming up to add much needed dimension to a character that was at the time a little flat. The fact that this story idea was created and plotted as Claremont and Miller were driving back from the San Diego comic book convention probably helped fuel some of the angst that the poured into revamping Logan's character.<br />This story cements Wolverine as a Ronin, a Samurai without a master, and shows him one of his greatest loves, the tragic Mariko Yashida, who is still one of my favorites out of Logan's vast bevy of beauties.<br />Whether you're a long time Wolverine/X-Men reader and somehow managed to skip over this one, or a fan of the movies and looking for a place to start, I highly recommend this graphic novel.<br />Just a note, if you are just beginning, please check out the Essential Wolverine volumes 1-3. For the money you get a lot a great reading and even more insight into this enigmatic mutant.	2003-05-13

While this book works well as either a paper weight, a sleeping pill, or fly swatter, it doesn't function very well as a story. When this storyline debuted, it was surrounded by a media storm, the excitement was palatable, but I haven't been this disappointed since Godfather III.<br />For all of the fans that have been with Wolverine since the very beginning (like myself) this story doesn't answer many of our questions. It just answers who Logan's parents are and what his real name is, but in a round about way, like the writers were trying to be cool, but not quite getting there. The brightest point in this black hole is the Andy Kubert pencils. For those alone, the books worth thumbing through, but do just that. Go to your local bookstore and look at the artwork, then put the book down and save your money! Spend it on a comic that deserves it! I recommend the Essential Wolverine (volume 1, 2, or 3) or Wolverine by Chris Claremont and Frank Miller, ISBN 087135277X.	2003-05-12

While it's not as hardcore as some of the S&M literature out there, it's still quite engaging. Whether you are dominant or submissive, male or female, strait or gay, there's something in here for everyone.<br />One thing to keep in mind is that this is the first part of a three-part epic and some of the story is devoted more to character development than sex. Also, because this is the first part of a series and it's not very hard core, it's a good place to begin your S&M education.<br />Fans of Anne Rice's Vampire series may or may not like this series. It features none of the characters from her vampire series and very few of the same themes.	2003-05-06

This book has an amazing 223 urban legends and every one of them is a gem. While some of the stories are recognizable urban legends, such as `the hook' `spunk ball' and `baby on the car roof', others are lesser known. All of them are fun, and most are a page or less.<br />This is the perfect book to throw in your suitcase or backpack for having a little fun while traveling, tanning, or waiting for an appointment. It's also a great conversation starter, and the stories are great to read at parties for a laugh or cringe.<br />If you do decided to invest very wisely and buy this book, please read \\"the backyard archeologist\\". It's one of my favorite short stories of all time.	2003-04-28

Hot Blood: Stranger By Night is Gelb and Garrett's 9th book in the Hot Blood series, but it is by no means stale, or stories you've read before. Where most of the other Hot Blood books sample a variety of erotic horror, this volume leans more towards crime mixed with sex and violence, and probably served as a model for the current Flesh and Blood series.<br />This volume sports stories from such noted authors as Brian Lumley (Necros), Mike W. Barr (A Real Woman), Jeff Gelb (Tricks or Treat), and Ramsey Campbell (The Limits of Fantasy).<br />So if you feel like an demonic roller coaster ride into the nights and lows of human depravity, if you want a sexual charge on the way, then get in line to ride the Hot Blood: Crimes of Passion express.	2003-04-22

This it delivers on. However, like the coarse cloth used in 'drinking torture' many of the entries are hard to swallow. In places, the author copies long passages in archaic English that's so hard to understand, reading them is a torture in and of itself.<br /> Still, this book does offer plenty of insight into the delightful depravity of the human mind. So if your stomach is strong enough, if your mind is warped enough, if your imagination is flexible enough, then step into Abbott's dungeon.	2003-04-18

Personally, I recommend \\"The Return of the Sorcerer\\" by Clark Ashton Smith.
