Yet the women live as slaves, with no hope for the future. As enlightened and well-read as Khan thinks he is, his attitude towards his family is medieval. I have often wondered how fundamentalist Muslims justify subjugating half the human race, and why they do not consider that denying women the chance to develop their God-given intelligence and abilities is spitting in the face of Allah.	2005-01-05

I tried the recipe for Roast Pork Tenderloin with Dried Cherries and Rosemary. Step One says to preheat the oven, Step Two to mix up a marinade, and Step Three to marinate the pork tenderloin for two to three hours or overnight. So is the oven supposed to preheat &quot;for two to three hours or overnight&quot;? What a stupid, stupid, STUPID mistake to include in a good-looking, pricey, upscale cookbook. There is no excuse for such carelessness and lack of attention to detail. (To add injury to insult, this expensive recipe wasn't even very good.) I will try a few other recipes in an effort to get my money's worth, but my initial favorable impression of the book has been damaged. Was somebody trying to save a few bucks by not hiring an editor?

So far, I have made the Lemon Pound Cake and the Lemon Mousse, and both were absolutely scrumptious! I froze the leftover pound cake in individually wrapped slices, and it is delightful, thawed in the microwave oven, with my morning coffee. I topped each serving of the mousse with a bit of sweetened whipped cream and a fanned-out sliced strawberry, and it looked like an elegant restaurant dessert. My guests were tremendously impressed, as was my husband! <br />I can't wait to try the Perfect Lemon Tart recipe and the different cookie recipes. Lori has really done her homework; the recipes are not only delicious, but carefully documented and easy to follow. One caveat: In the lemon mousse recipe, the gelatin never becomes completely clear--it stays translucent--so just stir it until it is completely dissolved, and then leave it in the bowl of hot water until you are ready to use it. If you take it out of the hot water bath and set it on the counter, it will jell surprisingly quickly, and you will have to rewarm it in order to liquify it again.

But the lead character had no backbone at all. God knows, I've had trouble standing up to people myself, but when Dean finally cussed her controlling, insensitive, neglectful, boneheaded husband out (and I was thinking YES!!!), she humbly apologized in the very next paragraph! No, no, no!!! Ben's backside needed kicking, and Dean was certainly justified in kicking it.<br />Aside from that, the book was just too predictable. There were very few surprises, and I couldn't believe how long it took Dean to catch on to things that seemed so obvious to me. Overall, I was very disappointed in the book. It was a struggle to finish it. As much as I admire Ms. King's enlightened view of gay people and other \\"hot button\\" issues, I cannot recommend this book.	2003-07-28

I think that she a) loved Grayer very much, and b) needed the job. Standing up to the Xes would have ended her relationship with the little boy, cost her the job, *and* ruined her chances of getting even a halfway satisfactory reference. The book's ending was shattering, and my heart broke for little Grayer. I cannot imagine how he could recover from such a trauma. While there were amusing sections in the book, I found it, overall, tragic. It was a very good, quick read, but I hope for a sequel to tie up some of the loose ends.	2003-04-30

I can only hope that CITES will encounter enough resultant unfavorable publicity from this book to spur some much-needed changes. I now plan to read Eric's other books; he is a superb writer!

The story is so well told, it is impossible to put the book down. Laura Hillenbrand really, really did her homework in bringing all of the central characters vividly to life. (The amount of research this took--richly detailed at the end of the book--is staggering). I found myself reading portions of the book aloud to my husband, and we shared a hearty laugh over Red Pollard's hilarious NBC radio broadcast. While I read extensively, I am not generally attracted to sports-related subject matter, yet I found &quot;Seabiscuit&quot; enthralling. Read it to be transported back to the 30s, to encounter genuine heroism, to root for a plucky underdog, to be greatly entertained. I can't recommend the book highly enough. Excellent!	2002-01-02

Even the severe illness and death of one of my close family members did not deter the manager and co-workers who harassed, ridiculed, and humiliated me; they were completely heartless. Because their torment was neither sexual, ethnic, nor religious in nature, I felt I had no recourse but to resign.  <br /> <br />At the time of my resignation, I was taking sleeping medication and antidepressants, and being treated for chronic stomach problems. Within a month of leaving, I was off all prescription drugs. Although I had nightmares four or five nights a week for more than a year, and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress syndrome, at least I was finally free from the daily abuse. I thank God that I got out before I suffered irreparable harm; my research tells me that some people are no longer able to work after this kind of experience. <br /> <br />My former manager is still at the company, doubtless causing untold grief for another stressed-out employee who is struggling desperately to please her. Tyrants like her must always have a scapegoat; trampling upon other people is what makes them feel superior. <br /> <br />This book reassured me that I am not alone, and that the abuse wasn't my fault. Thank God for the Namies. They have performed an invaluable public service by writing \\"The Bully at Work.\\" Kudos to them!  <br /> <br />I also highly recommend a related book, \\"Mobbing: Emotional Abuse in the American Workplace\\" by Noa Davenport, which is available here on Amazon. If you've read this far, you are probably seeking help. Good luck to you, my friend.	2001-10-17

As someone who was mobbed for three anguished years, I found this book a revelation.     Because my harassment was neither sexual, religious, nor ethnic in origin, I felt I had no legal recourse--and I felt terribly alone. This book gave a name to what happened to me, and assured me that I am far from alone. Again and again, I saw myself and my tormentors in its pages. Although it was painful to recall some of the worst abuses, I take great comfort in the knowledge that I was not responsible for what happened to me.     My manager and her cronies were cruel, vicious, and malevolent. I eventually left and moved on with my life; my manager is still there, no doubt causing terrible pain to another stessed-out employee trying desperately to please her. I hope the US will follow the lead of some European countries and pass legislation against workplace mobbing and bullying. It is illegal to abuse spouses and children; it should also be illegal to abuse co-workers.	2001-07-17

My mother never made Chicken Piccata. But if she had, she would have won raves with Holly's recipe! This is a terrific book that also makes a great gift. It's well organized and contains loads of useful info--I especially like the preparation times for each meal (this is not just a collection of recipes, but a collection of meal plans). Holly knows a lot about reducing fat and sodium without skimping on flavor. All the recipes I've tried have been delicious. The grilled salmon with dill sauce is another winner, and Holly's garlic mashed potatoes are to die for!<br />Holly's suggestion to spray food items, rather than cooking surfaces, with cooking spray is brilliant, as it keeps cooking surfaces much cleaner. <br />My only complaint (and it's a teeny-tiny one) is that the nutrition counts are for entire meals, instead of for individual dishes, making it a little tricky to mix and match. However, that's a small price to pay for such a fun, useful cookbook! Thanks, Holly!	2001-06-11

Wish it could be six!	I originally gave this book four stars, but after trying *many more* of the absolutely delicious recipes, I felt compelled to write a new review and up the star count to five. This book is fabulous! The more I use this book, the more Beth Hensperger seems like a friend guiding me as I learn about my bread machine's capabilities, and I can't thank her enough.<br />I ordered the SAF yeast from the King Arthur Flour Company and it really does make a difference. (The expiration date stamped on the package troubled me, because it was only a five months away, so I emailed King Arthur and learned that if you keep the yeast in the freezer, it will be good for a year or more. The stamped date is based on professional bakery use, where the yeast sits out in a hot kitchen every day.) <br />I have tried several whole wheat and semolina breads, graham bread, seeded whole grain breads, and white breads, and they all turned out beautifully. The semolina bread was particularly luscious baked on the French bread cycle for a crackling crisp crust and slathered with garlic butter, as Hensperger recommends. Using Hensperger's guidelines, I successfully added gluten to other recipes that did not call for it and saw the breads rise perfectly. <br />Beth Hensperger's talent for recipe development is amazing; her sandwich buns and pizza crusts turned out great, too! (A nice bonus is her pizza sauce recipe, which is scrumptious and very easy.) I love, love, love this book!	2001-02-13

I first made a country-style bread that combined whole wheat and bread flours with a touch of maple syrup, and it was yummy. I'll be trying one of the Italian semolina bread recipes this weekend for an Italian dinner party. But my favorite so far has been the Vienna bread. It is best while still warm from the machine (slathered with butter, if you're feeling naughty). It is fairly dense for a white bread, makes great sandwiches, and keeps well for several days. I haven't yet tried any of the biga (starter) breads, but I am looking forward to them. I wish the book contained a cinnamon-raisin bread recipe that was *not* gluten-free; I'll have to improvise.<br />The instructions in this book are clear and very easy to follow. I also appreciate knowing which recipes are suitable for use with the delay timer. While some ingredients are hard to find, plenty of the recipes call for readily available items. I've discovered that the vital wheat gluten required in most recipes is available at my local Safeway, as are Red Star yeast and semolina flour. <br />The fact that vital wheat gluten is *not* the same as wheat gluten flour is mentioned in the book, but not emphasized strongly enough. Also, I have to remember to add salt along with the liquid ingredients, although the recipes list salt with the dry ingredients, because my bread machine manual states that salt can interfere with the action of the yeast if it comes in contact with the yeast too early. Perhaps this is a possibility unique to my machine (a Breadman Ultimate). I agree with an earlier poster who complained that recipes using the Dough cycle (for breads to be baked in an oven) call for unplugging the machine at the completion of the cycle; this seems unnecessary. <br />Overall, I am pleased with and inspired by this book, which contains a great amount of useful information and a slew of easy and delicious-sounding recipes! Thanks, Beth!	2001-01-17

I never heard of him until I bought this book, but now I want all his recipes! I disagree with an earlier reviewer who said these recipes are only for gas grills; I have a charcoal grill and have  made several dishes very successfully.<br />In fact, I made the Tandoori  Chicken for dinner the other night. My husband and I were enthralled--it  was absolutely delicious, and not a whole lot of work. I mixed up the  marinade in the morning and let the chicken marinate in the fridge all day,  and then took it out just before I fired up the grill. By the time the  coals were ready, I had scraped the marinade off the chicken pieces, so all  I had to do was throw them on the grill. I cooked them low and slow, over  indirect heat, and they came out wonderfully fragrant, with a slightly  smoky flavor from the charcoal. Mmmmm . . . <br />I plan to make this again  for our next party, using chicken drumsticks. (Because they are easy to  carry around and eat without utensils, they are great party food!)

Rosie's recipe for chocolate sour cream cake layers makes the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted. As a friend of mine commented, &quot;It's the essence of chocolate!&quot; The book also contains a three-ingredient  chocolate frosting recipe, made in a blender, that is quick, easy, and  perfect on the chocolate cake.<br />The intro section of the book, which  describes how Rosie started her baking business, is also very interesting.  I enjoyed getting the inside story on this successful self-made  entrepreneur.<br />Thanks to Rosie for sharing her delectable recipes. This  cookbook is a keeper!	2000-02-16

It covers a  wide variety of dishes, from simple to complex. In addition to lots of  great photos, there is good information on ingredients with which beginning  cooks or cooks new to Chinese cooking may not be familiar. This book is a  bargain and I keep mine within easy reach in my kitchen. I've made the  simple fried rice time and again; although Susanna Foo's fried rice is  delicious, it is much more labor-intensive than the fried rice recipe in  Yan-Kit's book. Hint: try them both!	2000-02-08

This book introduced me to sourdough baking, and I haven't had a recipe failure yet. The basic starter is foolproof, and the bread recipes are fantastic. The sourdough chocolate  cake is both scrumptious and unique. I have been making extra-large  sourdough onion-cheese sandwich buns for decades; they require no kneading,  freeze beautifully, and make for show-stopping burgers. I hope the  publisher reprints this cookbook--my copy is falling apart!	2000-02-08

If you don't have at least some training, and (most importantly) don't have a slew of helpers, you would be well-advised to steer clear of actually attempting to make this stuff. The work involved will make you too tired to enjoy your own party.<br />Yes, you can make some things ahead and freeze them--but even then, it's hard for some of us to devote an entire weekend (or even an entire day) to cooking. The recipes I tried were both labor-intensive and very time-consuming. I picked up some great ideas for arranging prepared foods and fruit and veggie trays, and I will still enjoy this book as a reference for presenting food, but I doubt if I'll attempt to cook from it again. Whew!	2000-02-02

I greatly enjoy the photos and anecdotes in this book, as well as the terrific recipes.<br />I make the  Hot Water Pie Crust in nine-crust batches and freeze it (it freezes  perfectly). It is the easiest pie crust recipe I've ever used and tastes  just like Grandma's. We don't have pie often, due to its fat content, but  when we do, this crust never fails. <br />The oven-fried chicken recipe is  also a winner. Again, it has a lot of fat, but it's great for special  occasions and company dinners. <br />Kudos to Marcia for ensuring that these  treasured recipes aren't lost, and for providing a peek at a unique way of  life.	2000-02-02

This is a terrific cookbook; using it has saved me loads of time and effort in the kitchen. I like the easy-to-read type and the clear instructions. My pressure cooker has gotten a lot more use since I bought Pat's book.<br />One helpful point Pat makes is that with a pressure cooker, even the most time-crunched of us can keep our freezers supplied with homemade stock--very useful to have on hand! (I always freeze some in ice-cube trays for recipes that only require small amounts.)<br />An earlier reviewer recommended the recipe for \\"Chicken in Vinegar,\\" which I agree is delicious, but my favorite so far is \\"Teriyaki Spareribs.\\" These ribs are outstanding and make wonderful party food, too. Guests just can't get enough of them!<br />I wish the book contained nutritional info, but even without it, this is still a great cookbook. Brava, Pat--and bon appetit!	2000-02-02

I recently made Marta's delicious scrambled eggs, and now my husband doesn't want them prepared any other way. I am anxious for summertime, when I will try some of Marta's fresh vegetable salads and her summer pudding.<br />The photos in this book show the private side of the Kennedys, which evoked bittersweet feelings in me. I remember Camelot and the tragedies that followed; paging through the photos in Marta's book brought back some of the warm, familial feelings the Kennedys engendered. Since the recent death of JFK Jr., the memories chronicled in this book are especially touching.<br />Marta, you have written a charming tribute to the Kennedy family, whose members you obviously love and respect. Brava!	2000-01-18

This is a book I turn to again and again, a book to savor by the fireplace on a cold night, while sipping a glass of wine, a book that transports me to a place and time where the enjoyment of food and drink is paramount,  and nothing else really matters much.<br /><br />The descriptions of the meals are  wonderfully delectable. The author had such a keen eye for observation and  such a facility for description that it came as quite a shock to me to  learn, long after reading the book, that he was blind.<br /><br />I have never  dined this way--these glorious, elegant, leisurely meals must have lasted  for hours--but what fun to read about them! You will never look at that  dusty bottle of Chartreuse in the back of your liquor cabinet the same way  again.<br /><br />This book is essential reading for foodies, and a pleasure for  anyone who enjoys food or travel writing. Buy this book; you won't regret  it!	1999-08-27
