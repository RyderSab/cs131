In BROKEN PREY, there are only two subplots, one of them involving Sloan, Lucas Davenport's Minneapolis homicide detective sidekick, the other consisting of the top 100 Rock songs for Lucas's new iPod. Sloan is thinking of retiring and opening a bar, appropriately named Shooters. Lucas is trying to talk him out of it.<br /><br /> The main plot thread centers around the hospital for the criminally insane in St. Peter, Minnesota. Sandford renames it St. John's. When a serial killer scourges, murders, and displays a woman on a Minneapolis riverbank,  the detectives target garbageman Charlie Pope, a recently released sex addict from St. John's. Once again Lucas Tanner turns to psychologist and Roman Catholic nun, Sister Mary Joseph (Elle) for assistance. She compiles a profile of the killer, insisting that Charlie Pope isn't smart enough to be the killer.<br /><br /> Two weeks later, there's another victim, this time a man, also scourged, also put on display. Lucas and the other detectives interview the doctors, staff, and a trio of homicidal sex maniacs referred to as \\"The Gods Down the Hall.\\" The detectives think the trio may be \\"running\\" Charlie Pope from  inside St. John's. There is almost non-stop action, building to a climax inside the walls of St. John's.<br /><br /> Lucas Davenport has a cool quotient well into the stratosphere; when he's not driving his Porsche, he's racing his Lexus truck down the county roads around Mankota, taking on the killer face-to-face. When he's introduced to one of the female doctors at St. John's she's immediately drawn to him. But he's faithful to Weather, his plastic surgeon wife.<br /><br /> The Prey books are also liberally sprinkled with humor. Lucas would never get away with his \\"superman\\" persona if he didn't make fun of himself. He's also had his nose broken more times than Rocky Graciano. I find the Prey series almost as reliable as McBain's 87th Precinct novels. One little quibble, though: On the last couple of pages, Sandford shows us Lucas's top 100 rock songs, and he's chosen \\"Jailhouse Rock,\\" as his Elvis selection, thereby jeopardizing Lucas's cool quotient.ittle quibble, though: On the last couple of pages, Sandford shows us Lucas's top 100 rock songs, and he's chosen \\"Jailhouse Rock,\\" as his Elvis selection, thereby jeopardizing Lucas's cool quotient.	2005-10-11

In SHAKESPEARE BY ANOTHER NAME, Mark Anderson relentlessly builds a case, using the Earl of Oxford's biography, that Edward de Vere wrote the Shakespearean plays, sonnets, and epic poems.<br /><br /> Anderson begins with the death of de Vere's father when Edward was only twelve. At this time de Vere became Lord Burghley's ward and went to live with him. There was no better place for a burgeoning author to grow up. De Vere had access to the greatest library in England and such tutors as the translator of Ovid's METAMORPHOSIS, generally considered one of the premier influences on Shakespeare's art. Eventually de Vere would marry Lord Burgley's daughter, Ann Cecil, who would become the model for Ophelia, Desdemona etc. Anderson argues that the marriage between de Vere and Ann Cecil was never consummated prior to his European tour. Ann got pregnant while he was away, and an Iago-like like servant, Rowland Yorke, made matters worse by poisoning de Vere's mind against his wife. Another convincing parallel was the Earl of Leicester's theft of de Vere inheritance, which became the plot for Hamlet.<br /><br /> Later on de Vere would have an affair with Ann Vavasour, a lady in waiting at Queen Elizabeth's court. She got pregnant, twice, and she would become the model for Juliet and Rosaline in ROMEO AND JULIET. You scoff? Vavasour and de Vere were sent (temporarily) to the Tower of London for their amorous shenanigans. Vavasour's uncle, Thomas Knyvet, then challenged de Vere to a duel, in which the Earl was wounded. Payback resulted and Knyvet and Oxford's men had further fracases resulting in the death of two servants.<br /><br /> I would suppose that the Stratford on Avon people could explain away the above pretty easily, but it was the little things that convinced me. One would be Shakespeare's reference to the Bohemian seacoast in THE WINTER'S TALE. Ben Jonson (perhaps jokingly) would later criticize Shakespeare's lack of geographical knowledge since there was no Bohemian coast. Jonson was wrong; De Vere visited the place on his Grand Tour. Another convincing tidbit was de Vere's familiarity with the names Rosenkrantz and Guldenstern. Peregrine Bertie, de Vere's son-in-law, met these two Danish diplomats while on a diplomatic mission for Queen Elizabeth. Then there's the pirate scene in HAMLET in which Hamlet was left naked on a beach. The same thing happened to de Vere while crossing the English Channel upon his return from Europe.<br /><br /> Anderson also writes extensively about two of de Vere's secretaries, Anthony Munday and John Lyly, both of whom eventually became established writers themselves. Why would a supposed wastrel like de Vere need literary secretaries? One of de Vere's secretaries also left what might eventually be the smoking gun in the Shakespeare controversy, an original play written by Edward de Vere.  Abraham Fleming's archives eventually fell into the hands of an antiquarian named Francis Peck.  Among them was an early draft of what sounds like TWELFTH NIGHT.  Peck had plans to publish the play, but for some reason never got around to it. If Fleming's archive could be someday relocated, it could provide definite proof that de Vere was really Shakespeare.<br /><br /> There is also little doubt that Edward de Vere was a playwright. Many of the masques performed at court sound strikingly familiar: THE TROUBLESOME REIGN OF KING JOHN; THE TRUE CHRONICLE HISTORY OF KING LEIR; THE TRUE TRAGEDY OF RICHARD III; A HISTORY OF ERRORS; A MOOR'S MASQUE, to name only a few. Anderson argues that these were early drafts of the Shakespearean plays as was \\"Ur-Hamlet,\\" thought to have been a Shakespearean source.<br /><br /> Then we have Susan de Vere (Cordelia in KING LEAR?), de Vere's youngest daughter. She married the Earl of Montgomery, who with the Earl of Pembroke, his brother, would publish THE FIRST FOLIO. Who else would have access to all the plays?<br /><br /> Anderson includes four Appendices. One examines de Vere'sGeneva Bible and its underlinings for references and themes used in the plays. Another examines the 1604 controversy; de Vere died in 1604 and some scholars argue that THE TEMPEST and other plays include references to current events that happened later than 1604. Another appendix traces the provenance of a painting that was supposed to be of Shakespeare. Anderson maintains the man in the painting was really de Vere.<br /><br /> True or not, Mark Anderson's SHAKESPEARE BY ANOTHER NAME is a fascinating, fascinating book.examines de Vere's Geneva Bible and its underlinings for references and themes used in the plays.

I had never read Nevada Barr before, but I was intrigued by the Park Ranger main character, Anna Pigeon, and the setting in Mesa Verde National Park in Colorado, home to the Anasazi peoples who abruptly disappeared eight hundred years ago.<br /><br /> Unfortunately Barr doesn't concentrate on the Anasazi. Instead the conflict centers on Tom Silva, a divorced pipeline rigger who wants his wife back. He sends her his foreskin in the mail, and Anna is called on to deal with him. The Mesa Verde rangers are part-time rangers and part-time police officers.<br /><br /> The problem with the book is Barr's choice of the author limited point of view. She's in the character's head constantly. Author limited can be a good choice if you're interested in portraying emotion, but it also can lead to too much internal monologue, especially during dramatic scenes. Pigeon is a recently widowed woman; she's also new at Mesa Verde and is having trouble dealing with her roommates. She also phones her psychiatrist sister for advice quite often, and she's got a drinking problem. If you're thinking she sounds maudlin, you're right.<br /><br /> The story finally picks up after the first hundred pages or so when one of the other rangers disappears. He's found at the bottom of a kiva with burn marks on his arms. It looks like a suicide. Barr decides to throw in a foiled love affair with Pigeon to heighten the tension.<br /><br /> Despite the above, the novel does have some touching moments. The dead ranger's has a six-year-old daughter who's a little dearie, and her Aunt Hattie is certainly \\"uplifting\\" as well. The daughter happens to be a dwarf. I know it sounds unbelievable, but Barr manages to handle this quite well. Add a rather eccentric FBI agent to the mix, and matters improve considerably.	2005-09-18

It was one in a series of offbeat mysteries, featuring Joe Crow, a former cocaine addict and reluctant P.I. It was set at the Minnesota State Fair. I loved it. After reading most of the others in the series, plus a few more literary efforts, I was dismayed to find Hautman had abandoned the humorous/mystery market for the young adult novel. I was even more surprised to find he'd won the National Book Award for one of them.<br /><br /> Anyway I thought I'd read GODLESS to see if the irreverent humor I loved so much translated to a new genre. I'm of two minds. I absolutely love the idea. Just about every intelligent kid questions his religion at one time or another, so there's certainly grist for the mill. It's just that these characters didn't come alive for me like Axel and his friends in Mortal Nuts (a poker term, meaning you've got an unbeatable hand). Some of them are way over the top.<br /><br /> In response to his father's steadfast belief in the Catholic church, Jason Bock creates his own, the Chutengodians, who worship the town water tower. Jason sees himself as an agnostic moving towards becoming an atheist, and he's trying to show that his new, made-up religion is no more outlandish than some of the others. But soon the idea gets out of hand and some of his followers take the whole thing seriously. In other words, Hautman has written sort of a young adult satire, which may have appealed to the National Book Award voters.<br /><br /> The plot isn't much. They climb the tower and swim around in it. They get caught. Jason spends time in jail. The two characters who take things to extremes are Henry Stagg and Peter \\"Shin\\" Schinner. Stagg, a little bully who loves science fiction, soon splits off from the main group and forms his own religion (sound familiar?). Shin, a cerebral fellow with an unhealthy attachment to gastropods (snails), becomes a Chutengodian zealot, going so far as to write his own Genesis (used as chapter headings).<br /><br /> (...)gs).

Sadly, Salvatore Lombino, alias Evan Hunter, alias Ed McBain has gone to his just rewards.<br /><br /> No other writer has been as consistently good for as long as McBain, who started this series in 1956. Admittedly, I did not like the 87th Precinct novels at first, but I became hooked when I bought a three-for-one anthology at a booksale. Police procedurals stress plot over characterization and it took me that long to get to know Steve Carella, Meyer Meyer, Cotton Hawes, Burt Kling and the rest.<br /><br /> McBain is a master at weaving together subplots, and FIDDLERS is no different. The detectives of the 87th are on the trail of a serial killer who seems to be targeting senior citizens: a blind violinist, a cosmetics sales rep, a college professor, a priest, and an old woman out walking her dog. We also get a brief look at Carella's personal life as his thirteen-year-old Twins are growing up. There's also some social commentary as Burt Kling deals with his bi-racial relationship. The novel ends with a hook, pointing toward the next in the series: Fat Ollie's love affair with Patricia Gomez seems headed for trouble as he turns to Andy Parker, of all people, for advice.<br /><br /> I have a feeling McBain was working right down to the end, as he often completed two novels a year, as McBain and his alter ego Evan Hunter. But if there are no further Precinct novels, I plan to start all over with COP HATER and THE MUGGER if I can find them. Although McBain always kept some 50s elements in his newer work, it'll be fun to compare the early work with his modern stuff.<br /><br /> God speed, Salvatore!	2005-09-07

Certainly there's enough diamond action to satisfy the sport fan, but Eig's objective seems to be more of a psychological analysis of the great Yankee clean-up hitter (Ruth hit third).<br /><br /> Eig goes into great depth about Gehrig's relationship with his mother. Apparently no woman was good enough for her son. Gehrig was thirty before he finally took a wife and that seemed to be an act of desperation as he sent Eleanor a diamond necklace before they actually went out on a date.<br /><br /> For me the best part of the book was when Gehrig found out he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Talk about grace under fire. Gehrig established a relationship with the doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, reminiscent of hero worship. He collected bats and balls and other baseball paraphernalia and sent them to the Rochester youth. He signed autographs as well as soliciting signatures from his teammates.<br /><br /> Probably the saddest episode was Eig description of Gehrig's final eight days playing for the Yankees, during which time he repeatedly fell down, dropped throws, and managed only four hits. His manager, Joe McCarthy, refused to take him out. Gehrig finally removed himself from the lineup.<br /><br /> The last third of the book deals with Gehrig's life after baseball. Eig recounts the entire farewell speech at Yankee stadium, something he had to piece together since the audience, including the sports writers, were so caught up in the speech that they only managed to copy parts of it.<br /><br /> Eig then describes how Eleanor and the Mayo Clinic doctors handled Gehrig's treatment. Eleanor insisted they not tell him he was going to die. He underwent various treatments, including an immersion of vitamin E. Almost until the last he thought he had a 50/50 chance. He even took a job as a parole officer working for Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.<br /><br /> Eig leans over backwards to avoid hagiography. He includes an anecdote from Rocky Graziano, who spent some time in the Tombs as a youth. Apparently Gehrig was so condescending that the Rock wanted to kill him. Eig also furnishes numerous examples of how tight Gehrig was with the penny and how submissive he was around authority figures. For instance, he never would have given his famous speech, if Joe McCarthy hadn't insisted.<br /><br /> One of the greatest baseball movies ever made, The Pride of the Yankees, which garnered nine academy award nominations, was made about Gehrig.

This woman is a professional, and she's got some sensible suggestions.<br /><br /> According to her bio, she's written over twenty books, including such diverse genres as romance, mystery/police procedural, suspense, thriller, paranormal, and action/ adventure. Perhaps even more impressive is her planning acumen. Wiesner is always two, three novels ahead of the game, thanks to her formatted outline.<br /><br /> Many writers either can't or don't want to outline their novels in advance (See Tony Hillerman, for instance). Wiesner couldn't either at first until she developed the formatted outline. Wiesner refers to the formatted outline as the first draft of the book. When she revises, she revises the outline rather than suffer through countless drafts of the manuscript.<br /><br /> This woman is a real left-brainer. She plans virtually everything, including time to let the manuscript marinate. The appendices include character, setting, plot, and research outlines as well as a place to write potential interview questions for possible experts and your characters. Her story evolution worksheet is almost as helpful as the formatted outline.<br /><br /> And-oh,yes-I almost forgot Chapter eight. It's for us poor shleps who already have a completed manuscript with all kinds of holes.

No, this is not the last novel in the series and no Rumpole does not die. Since this title was released, two more Rumpoles have been published-RUMPOLE AND THE PRIMROSE PATH and RUMPOLE AND THE PENGE BUNGALOW MURDERS.<br /><br /> Like the Sherlock Holmes stories, the characterization in these stories is far superior to the plots. Rumpole is one of the most loveable characters in British fiction, but even on what he perceives as his death bed, he manages to find a possible client and begins to formulate his closing statement in his mind.<br /><br /> What I found most impressive about these seven stories was Mortimer's weaving of contemporary issues into the stories. The members of chambers, primarily Liz Probert and Soapy Sam Ballard, have decided on a smoke-free environment. If Rumpole wants to smoke his beloved \\"small cigars,\\" he most do it outside in the foul London weather. Rumpole sets out to blackmail Ballard into letting him smoke. This plot thread persists through several of the stories. In another story, Rumpole defends an Afghan who is seeking asylum in England. In the same story we get a bit of reality TV as Hilda volunteers to have the flat at Froxbury Mansions remodeled on a program called MAKE OVER.<br /><br /> Some of the supporting cast in the Rumpole stories don't change a whole lot. Erskine-Brown is always a \\"Queer Customer.\\" Liz Probert is a younger version of Phillada; Judge Bullingham is always \\"The Bull.\\" In this series of stories, Mortimer decides to tweak one of them a bit. When Rumpole sets out to blackmail Sam \\"Soapy\\" Ballard into letting him smoke in chambers, his effort has unforeseen consequences, making Ballard a much more likable character.<br /><br /> I liked the Penge Bungalow Murders better than this effort, probably because it's written in more of a novel format and we get to see Rumpole as a young man being stalked by Hilda, but there's enough of the curmudgeonly Rumpole in these stories to give you your yearly Rumpole fix. For instance, he refers to one of the other characters as having \\"the face of an immoderately self-satisfied Pekinese.\\"nough of the curmudgeonly Rumpole in these stories to give you your yearly Rumpole fix.

Howard Kapostash is a Vietnam vet who stepped on a land mine, being rendered mute with the inability to read without extreme difficulty. After months of rehabilitation, he returns to the U.S. and his high school sweetheart, Sylvia. He turns to drugs as does Sylvia eventually. Thirty years later, Sylvia enters therapy, asking Howard to care for her nine-year-old son she'd had with another man.  The boy and the man bond immediately; it's almost a father/son relationship. Howard has a built-in support group, consisting of Laurel, his housemate who helps Howard with paperwork in return for a place to run her catering business, and his two other boarders, \\"the boys,\\" housepainters Nit and Nat. Quite a bit of the book deals with Howard coaching Ryan's Little League baseball team.<br /><br /> Howard tells the story as first person narrator; he has a card that he gives people, telling them that, although he can't speak, he is of normal intelligence. Howard has a part-time job at a convent where he cuts grass. He has problems with his supervisor, Sister Amity, who thinks Howard is questioning her authority.<br /><br /> The most compelling character in this novel IMHO is the female villain. Sylvia is completely self-possessed. If you look up the word \\"ingrate\\" in Webster's, you're likely to find Sylvia's picture. Howard has built a scenario in his mind where Sylvia, Ryan, and he will live happily ever after. Upon release from therapy, she completely bursts his bubble, calling the cops when he crashes emotionally. Author King also does an excellent job with Ryan, who is a completely believable nine-year-old, if a bit precocious.<br /><br /> I think most people will have some problems with the ending. Howard ends up pretty much where he started; he might even be worse off. It's hard to figure out what the heck Dave King is getting at. Is Howard supposed to settle for life as a second-class citizen? In her way, Laurel is just another Sylvia. King doesn't give us enough information about her to figure out her motivation. Apparently all she wants is a \\"family\\" relationship with Howard and the boys. She's lived with Howard for seven years. She has intimate moments with Howard, but she's either teasing or she's  the most clueless woman on the face of the earth.

If you like your conflicts fully resolved, you may want to look elsewhere; if you're bothered by unconventional punctuation, you may be irritated by this book; if you despise jump cuts and point of view shifts, you may find yourself rereading sections of this book to catch your bearings. Otherwise, however, you may find this one of the most original books you've read in years.<br /><br /> The story begins when Llewelyn Moss stumbles across the aftermath of a drug shootout while out antelope hunting. He follows a trail out into the desert at the end of which he finds a dead man and 2.4 million dollars. What he doesn't find (until it's too late) is the bug hidden in the money. Soon he has a dauntless hit man on his tail. The bodies pile up like cord wood. This part of the story is pretty conventional. Llewelyn Moss is likable and smart. He seems to anticipate the killer's every move, until he meets a fourteen-year-old, female hitchhiker, who proves to be too much of a distraction.<br /><br /> About two-thirds of the way through the book, the focus switches from Llewelyn to Sheriff Bell, who's trying to save Llewelyn from himself. There's more quirky point of view stuff going on here as McCarthy has Bell tell us what he's thinking in first person, then switches immediately to third, still using Bell as a focus. Bell philosophizes about how he's never seen criminals quite as bad as these drug pushers. He never really believed in Satan until confronted with these people. McCarthy does like to preach occasionally and Bell is a willing stand-in; he indicts not only the drug pushers, but also the people who buy them, and he also seems to hint at some kind of organized crime syndicate that is intentionally chipping away at the American character, hence the title NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.<br /><br /> I have to admit that I was completely caught off guard by what happened to Llewelyn Moss. It happens after a jump cut, and I kept thinking McCarthy was playing some kind of trick on the reader. No such luck. McCarthy is just as ruthless as Chigurh, the hit man. And there's another surprise in story when it comes time to resolve Sheriff Bell's story arc. You won't believe that one either.trick on the reader. No such luck.

I was a bit upset about the ending, but overall RULES FOR OLD MEN WAITING packs an emotional wallop. An old man, Robert MacIver, is grieving over the death of his wife. He forgets to eat, he neglects to haul in wood for the winter. Then, one day, as he's passing a full-length mirror, he notices how emaciated he's become, and he realizes he's dying of malnutrition. He's also suffering from some sort of terminal disease, so it's only a matter of time, but he decides to die with dignity. He sets up a regimen. He will eat well, he will burn his furniture and some of his books for heat, and he will write a  novel set on the battlefield. Very appropriate, since he's a WWI historian in the Studs Terkel mode.<br /><br /> RULES FOR OLD MEN WAITING also delves into MacIver's background: how he met his artist wife, his youth playing rugby for Scotland, the death of his son in Vietnam, his brief experience as a ship's captain in WWII. This flipping back and forth can be annoying, but it's entirely appropriate when we remember that this is about an old man reflecting back on his life.<br /><br /> MacIver's fictional story seems to be about good and evil. MacIver bases his characters on several actual soldiers he met while doing research for his historical works. The conflict is unusual in that it pits British soldiers against each other. We get a sense that MacIver is writing about human nature in general.<br /><br /> Robert MacIver is an extremely likable character, albeit a bit gruff at times. We know he's going to die, but we still have a faint hope that he'll make it somehow. At one point MacIver dangles a way out in the form of one of his ex-students, also a successful historian. There's always the danger of melodrama with this sort of thing, though, which may be why some may find Pouncey's abrupt ending disappointing.<br /><br />  Another telling plaudit is that Norman Mailer actually condescended to write a blurb for the book, \\"Mr. Pouncey writes with enough style and elegance to bring envy into the heart of many a good novelist.\\"style and elegance to bring envy into the heart of many a good novelist.\\"	2005-08-06

There's something about a paralyzed forensics expert who solves complicated cases with the aid of a beautiful redheaded sidekick that fascinates.<br /><br /> That said I've always had some reservations about Deaver. He loves the wild plot twist for one thing, and that's still the case with THE TWELFTH CARD. Through most of the book we think the attempted assault on Geneva Settle, a high school student doing research at the Museum of African-American Culture and History, has something to do with her ancestor, Charles Singleton, an emancipated slave who'd inherited land from his former master. But that's too easy for Deaver. Soon we're dealing with Arab terrorists, bombs going off right and left, and two or three more people trying to kill Geneva. It's all a little too much for the patient reader.<br /><br /> Then there's the matter of ebonics (I can't remember the more politically correct term). Every African-American character in the book sounds the same, including Geneva Settle, when she's around her friend Keesha and a potential boyfriend. Can you say the word s-t-e-r-e-o-t-y-p-e?<br /><br /> The saving grace in THE TWELFTH CARD is the villain, Thompson Boyd. He's a professional hit man who's been \\"numbed\\" by his profession. What's interesting is that he's trying to cure himself by cohabiting with a woman and her two little girls.

Thompson goes down a bit too easy about a hundred pages before the end of the book, again because of Deaver's penchant for the wild twist.<br /><br /> Despite the reservations mentioned above, I highly recommend this book.

Alexander McCall Smith's THE FULL CUPBOARD OF LIFE is definitely NOT a traditional mystery. Smith seems more interested in portraying the humanity of his African characters.<br /><br /> Mma \\"Precious\\" Ramotswe runs the No. 1 Ladies' Detective agency, but her principal case in this episode deals with an affair of the heart. She is hired to do a background check on five possible suitors for a woman who has acquired a small fortune running a hair-braiding franchise. Smith also deals with Mma Ramotswe's personal life. The man in her life, Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, has been bullied into volunteering for a parachute jump by the \\"traditional-sized\\" Mma Potokwane, a domineering orphanage administrator. Matekoni is also dragging his feet in respect to setting a wedding date.<br /><br /> J.L.B. Matekoni manages an automotive repair shop next to Precious's detective agency. The two apprentices who work for him cause him additional grief because of their obsession with girls and loud music and because of their sloppy work habits.<br /><br /> Smith characters can inspire humor and pathos. Ramotswe's assistant, for instance, has a brother who died of AIDS, but emulating Precious Ramotswe, she has pulled herself up by the bootstraps and scored a 97 on her secretarial exam. AND she knows shorthand, a skill not every secretarial graduate can lay claim to.<br /><br /> I haven't read any of the other books in the series, but I plan to go back and start at the beginning with THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY. The humility of Precious Ramotswe and her fellow characters is refreshing to say the least. American mystery writers could learn something from Alexander McCall Smith.	2005-07-18
US	52809057	RKUGM5MIA1077	0316011770	454028739	The Historian	Books	4	3	3	N	Y	Enough suspense to keep you turning pages	The plot turns in THE HISTORIAN are fairly typical of the vampire novel. The undead bite people's necks, there are silver bullets, lots of garlic for protection, and stakes are driven through people's hearts. The difference here is that the vampire is Vlad the Impaler, upon whom many of the legends about vampires are based. Apparently he was a thoroughly reprehensible person who slaughtered his own people as well as the Ottoman Turks.<br /><br /> The story starts when a young doctoral candidate finds a rare book and takes it to his thesis advisor. The book is blank except for a wood carving of a dragon. In short order we find that the dragon represents Vlad the Impaler. The thesis advisor, Bartholomew Rossi, disappears a short time later and the chase is on. Paul, the young historian, and his eventual wife, Helen Rossi (yes, she's Rossi's daughter), go looking for Dracula's grave.  Helen is bitten, by a blood-thirsty librarian who keeps showing up throughout the book, and we learn that you must be bitten three times before you get your vampire stripes.<br /><br /> Elizabeth Kostova takes us back to the thirties, and forward to the fifties and sixties. Every time she needs a plot twist, she introduces a new character. They get confusing to say the least, especially when Master James shows up during the climax (I had trouble remembering who he was). THE HISTORIAN is almost an epistolary novel in that Paul and Helen, and later Paul's daughter, keep discovering letters, journals, and books that move the story forward. The characters travel to Romania, Burgaria, Turkey, and throughout Europe.  Eventually we get to meet Dracula himself.<br /><br /> Kostova does a nice job with characterization. I really liked Paul's daughter and Barley, an Oxford student assigned to escort her back to Amsterdam, home base for her diplomat father. I also enjoyed Helen's mother, a simple Romanian peasant whose love affair with Rossi produced Helen.<br /><br /> On the other hand, I did have problems with Vlad's motivation. Apparently his only incentive for wanting to live forever is to find someone to catalogue his library. One would think he'd still be after the Ottoman Turks or something.<br /><br /> There's enough suspense to keep you interested in this 642-page book, despite the hokeyness of some of the vampire scenes. Why does Rossi not remember Helen's mother? Why is the church protecting Dracula? What happened to Rossi? etc., etc.did have problems with Vlad's motivation.

I would add hyperbole to that definition, and Chuck Palahniuk certainly uses it to great effect  in \\"Haunted.\\"<br /><br /> The reviews I've read have Palahniuk concentrating mainly on reality TV shows, but if you read the stories closely, you will see that he plays no favorites. Just about every segment of our society comes under fire.<br /><br /> The set-up deals with a number of screenwriters, novelists, and poets who answer an ad entitled  \\"Writers' Retreat: Abandon Your Life for Three Months.\\" They are taken to an abandoned theater where they set about making things worse, to create \\"plot points\\" for the masterpiece they will be writing. They destroy the furnace, clog the toilet, and ruin their food. Then they begin to amputate fingers and toes in order to become the headliner in the story.<br /><br /> For structural purposes, Palahniuk uses a Canterbury Tales format, with a poem and a story for each participant. They all have nicknames, such as Chef Assassin, The Matchmaker, Comrade Snarky,  Lady Baglady, and Saint Gut Free. Their leader, Mr. Whittier, who appears to be an old man, and his assistant, Mrs. Clark, are the only ones without a nom de plume.<br /><br /> If you've read the \\"Fight Club,\\" you know that Palahniuk doesn't pull any punches. These stories deal with child abuse (actually dummy abuse), masturbation, cannibalism, reverse terrorism, among other depravities. I have to admit I didn't like most of them, but I have to give Chuck P. credit for chutzpah. One of my favorites was \\"Guts,\\" about a boy who is disemboweled by a pool filter. It takes a sick sense of humor to appreciate this one, but the image of how the boy extricates himself is hilarious. \\"Exodus\\" is also very good; the star of this one is Director Denial who works for the Child and Family Case Services unit in a police department. She mistakenly orders anatomically correct dummies to be used in child abuse cases. The detectives begin to check them out for their own depraved purposes. Another one, \\"Speaking Bitterness,\\" deals with a female self-help group visited by a man who has had a sex change operation. They don't allow men, but he won't admit that he really is a man. He's too perfect for them; they begin to abuse him.<br /><br /> Each of these stories has a certain amount of credibility. \\"Punch Drunk,\\" for instance, is about reverse terrorism. The characters blame the world's problems on religion and set out to bomb Mecca, and the Vatican and other religious shrines.<br /><br /> Certainly some of these stories stretch the limits of acceptability, but if you've read \\"The Canterbury Tales,\\" you know that there is a certain depravity about some of them, \\"The Miller's Tale,\\" for instance. All you need to do is pick up a daily newspaper, and you'll find stories Palahniuk could have included in this anthology.child abuse cases.

Joanne Harris, author of CHOCOLAT, has written a historical novel set in 1610 France. Most of the action occurs in an abbey on an island off the coast. King Henry IV has recently been murdered and the boy king, Louis XIII has assumed the throne.<br /><br /> The heroine of the piece, Juliette (among other names) is an aerialist and actress with a minstrel troupe, led by a conman named Guy LaMerle. They have a love/hate relationship. The troupe is split when the minstrels are blamed for what looks like a recurrence of the plague. The pregnant Juliette goes to live at Abbey of Sainte Marie-de-la-mer where her daughter, Fleur, is born. She is leading a rather normal existence until the kind Reverend Mother dies. She is replaced by the powerful bishop's twelve-year-old niece who is under the thumb of LaMerle, disguised as her confessor.<br /><br /> Juliette knows that LaMerle is plotting something; she tries to leave with her daughter, but LaMerle, who wants to use her in his plot, kidnaps Fleur.<br /><br /> The suspense revolves around LaMerle's motivation in wanting to embarrass the bishop. What is there in his background that makes him hate the bishop so much? There's a twist, but you can see it coming for miles. Harris uses witchcraft and satanic possession to set up a climax situation between Juliette, LaMerle, and the bishop. This stuff gets old fairly quick, but Harris continues for pages and pages, bumping off nuns right and left.<br /><br /> The viewpoint alternates between Snidely Whiplash-like LaMerle and Juliette. Despite his nefarious schemes, Juliette has a soft spot for LaMerle and Harris keeps us wondering whether they'll eventually wind up together. This leads to a completely unrealistic ending. Would a mother forgive a man who'd kidnapped her daughter? I also had a problem with the minor characters, mostly nuns at the abbey. They're downright loony; there's a pretty one who beds LaMerle (he poisons her); two others who compete with each other with various ticks and ailments (coughing up blood etc.), a fat, stupid one who's smarter than Juliette thinks, and a wild girl, who alternates between helping LaMerle and Juliette.<br /><br /> I'm a sucker for historical novels, but this thing is just too much of a mess. If I wasn't such an obsessive/compulsive, I never would have been able to finish it.with various ticks and ailments (coughing up blood etc.), a fat, stupid one who's smarter than Juliette thinks, and a wild girl, who alternates between helping LaMerle and Juliette. <br /> <br /> I'm a sucker for historical novels, but this thing is just too much of a mess.

A blurb on the back of the book refers to WHERE YOU ONCE BELONGED as \\"A beautifully told parable-simple and stark and true.\\" The only parable I remember is \\"The Prodigal Son,\\" but it seems to me that a parable should teach a lesson. If Haruf was trying to teach a \\"moral attitude or religious principle\\" as Websters defines the word, I can't imagine what it would be.<br /><br /> In Haruf's second novel, Jack Burdette returns to Holt, Colorado, where he encounters Sheriff Bud Sealey who handcuffs him, then pistol whips him. The story goes on to show us why he got off easy. Burdette is a completely selfish individual, almost a sociopath, who spurns his girlfriend of eight years for a woman he met at a weekend workshop. Burdette has no patience with education, competition (football in this instance) where he can't be the star, or a cushy job that is handed to him after he flunks out of college. Jack is either a spoiled brat or he's got terminal ADHD.<br /><br /> Pat Arbuckle, the narrator isn't introduced until well into the story. He's the editor of the town newspaper and a former classmate of Jack's; he also becomes enamored of Jack's wife when his own marriage fails.<br /><br /> Although this story isn't as good as PLAINSONG, it has its moments. I was most impressed with a minor character who has more humanity than all the members of the Moral Majority put together. When Jack leaves his loyal girlfriend and marries another woman, she hits the skids, drinking and sleeping around. The man I'm talking about is her supervisor at the telephone company where she works. Instead of firing her, he transfers her to another town where her story isn't known. Haruf manages this with just a few sentences, and we never see this character again.<br /><br /> WHERE YOU ONCE BELONGED is a short book, only 176 pages, and I was disappointed in the ending (It comes to an almost screeching halt), but I was so absorbed I read it in two days. I'm convinced that Haruf uses real people or composites to fashion these characters. All of us have known a Jack Burdette someplace along the way. Unfortunately they're more numerous than that telephone company supervisor.e or composites to fashion these characters. All of us have known a Jack Burdette someplace along the way.

I've been a Porfiry Rostnikov fan forever. But since Kaminsky hasn't written a Porfiry mystery in well over three years I decided to try one of his other series.<br /><br /> The Abe Liebermann series has quite a bit in common with the Rostnikov mysteries. Both protagonists are over sixty and both are dedicated family men. But perhaps the major similarity is the Ed McBain influence. Rostnikov has a couple of underlings who are usually involved in their own cases. Liebermann has a partner named Bill Hanrahan, who calls Abe \\"The Rabbi.\\" Abe calls Hanrahan \\"Father Murphy.\\" These are working cops and they have more cases than a Budweiser brewery.<br /><br /> The book starts with Abe escorting a Mafia hitman back to Chicago from Yuma, Arizona. An elderly janitor shoots the hitman before Abe can get him on the plane. The janitor is an elderly man who claims he agreed to the contract to pay for his grandchildren's college.<br /><br /> Back in Chicago, Hanrahan and his temp partner, O'Neil are investigating a series of muggings and rapes. Hanrahan must also deal with O'Neil's racist and sexist remarks as well as the crime spree.<br /><br /> This wouldn't be a Kaminsky mysteries if the detectives didn't have personal problems to match their professional concerns. Liebermann's grandson, who lives with Liebermann and his wife, is having his bar mitzvah and Liebermann is trying to scrape together the money to pay for it. His daughter, with whom he doesn't get along, is also arriving for her son's big day. Meanwhile, someone has been calling Hanrahan's pregnant Chinese wife, warning her not to have the child.<br /><br /> Throw in the case of a sign painter, who is stalking a country western singer, whom he wants to kill, and you have quite a few story lines to keep track of.<br /><br /> Probably the most impressive aspect of the book for me was the theme of \\"respect for family and the elderly\\" that runs throughout the book. For instance, when Abe's grandson tells Abe he doesn't think he should go through with his bar mitzvah because he doesn't believe in God, Abe convinces him to do it for his grandmother, his other relatives, and all of the people who were looking forward to the event. Mr. Woo, an elderly Chinese crime lord, negotiates a truce between the Puerto Rican and Chinese gangs. Kaminsky puts a capper on this theme when the most deplorable human being in the book takes the fall for his grandmother when she's implicated in a shooting.he doesn't think he should go through with his bar mitzvah because he doesn't believe in God, Abe convinces him to do it for his grandmother, his other relatives, and all of the people who were looking forward to the event.

Now we get a chance to see a young \\"leaderless\\" Rumpole defending a young man charged with the murder of his own father.<br /><br /> The plot itself isn't much to speak of. The boy's father was an RAF veteran who liked to drink too much, and after a night out with some other RAF veterans, ridicules the boy for never having served in the war. The boy then grabs a gun off of the mantle and threatens his father with it. Later, the father turns up dead as does one of the other veterans who lives nearby, both shot with the same pistol. The pistol turns up in the dustbin behind the boy's bungalow.<br /><br /> We do get to meet the young Hilda, however, and she is just as relentless as a young woman as she was to be when Rumpole christened her SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED. Hilda gets Rumpole the brief as a sort of \\"second chair\\" to her father who is to defend the boy. The problem is C.H. Wystan, QC, has already made up his mind that the boy is guilty.<br /><br /> Mortimer seems to be trying to prove the Peter Principle, that each man rises to his level of incompetency. Just about everybody involved in  The Penge Bungalow Murders, except Rumpole,  is incompetent. C.H. Wystan is an older version of \\"Soapy Sam\\" Ballard, the present head of chambers. The judge in the case, who also seems to have already made up his mind about the boy's guilt, is another version of \\"The Bull.\\" He does everything in his power to obstruct justice. Then there's that clueless Lothario Claude Erskine Brown, who is still abusing the female members of chambers, and Uncle Tom, who even before he retired, never seemed to do anything.<br /><br /> The funniest part of the book is Rumpole's problems with the ladies. He mentions two or three that he preferred to Hilda, one of whom, unbeknownst to Rumpole, is helping the prosecution. We also learn that Rumpole served in the RAF himself and was known as \\"Grounded\\" Rumpole since he never qualified as a pilot. There's also a subplot where we see Rumpole defending the first in a long line of Timsons.<br /><br /> I was a bit disappointed in the PENGE BUNGALOW MURDERS. I was expecting a much splashier case and complex forensics in respect to the bloodstains. Rumple has always fancied himself an expert in respect to blood evidence; yet all we have here is a blood smear on a wall.

It's the same guy, but Baker has the chops to do both, as he is the chief historical researcher for the NEW YORK TIMES.<br /><br /> As I began to read, I was immediately reminded of several other books. AMERICAN TRAGEDY, THE ALIENIST, THE GANGS OF NEW YORK, and even CLOCKWORK ORANGE. The setting is New York City with Coney Island featured most of the time. There are gangsters and factory girls and Tammany Hall politicians and they all speak their own unique language, some Yiddish and Bowery slang. Thankfully I checked out the back of the book. Sure enough, there was a glossary. You'll be paging back and forth for the entire read.<br /><br /> There really isn't any main character, but Esse Abramowitz; her brother \\"Gyp the Blood;\\" Esse's lover Josef Kolykia, alias \\"Kid Twist;\\" and Tammany Hall politician Big Tim Sullivan do most of the heavy lifting. Trick the Dwarf tells the story. There is a dramatis personae provided at the beginning to help you keep track.<br /><br /> The plot begins when Kid Twist saves Trick the Dwarf's life at a Rat Bating by nailing Gyp the Blood with a shovel. For the rest of the book, Gyp the Blood is out to get Kid Twist. A subplot involves Esse Abramowitz's increasingly involvement in the Labor movement. She also works at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co., and if you're up on your history, you know what happened there.<br /><br /> I was a bit disappointed in the ending. Trick the Dwarf suggests what MIGHT have happened to the major actors, rather than telling us. There's also a subplot involving Sigmund Freud that seems to be included just to add some historical credence. As Baker tells us in his acknowledgments, Freud really did visit America in 1909, but his conflict with Carl Jung doesn't seem to have a whole lot to do with anything.<br /><br /> Despite my misgivings, I heartily recommend this book for the Coney Island atmosphere and the Yiddish jargon alone.spite my misgivings, I heartily recommend this book for the Coney Island atmosphere and the Yiddish jargon alone.  <br />	2005-05-21

If he were alive today, John Gardner might be surprised to find that he's more well-known for THE ART OF FICTION and ON BECOMING A NOVELIST than he is for GRENDEL, MICKELSSON'S GHOSTS, etc. Gardner is probably the most influential writing guru alive or dead, despite the hundred of \\"self help\\" tomes turned out by Writer's Digest and others.<br /><br /> ON BECOMING A NOVELIST begins with a forward written by Raymond Carver, a former student of Gardner's at Chico State College in California. Carver, one of the leaders of the minimalist movement, went on to a successful career as a short story writer. Gardner gave Carver his first line edit, showing the importance of a good teacher for the beginning novelist.<br /><br /> This book is divided into four sections, the first entitled \\"The Writer's Nature.\\" In it Gardner describes the highest class of novelist as one who is fascinated by people different from himself. He talks about writers poring over astrology books and psychological case studies in order to find authentic characters.<br /><br /> The second section is entitled \\"The Writers Training and Education.\\" Gardner begins this section by discussing bad workshops. He likes workshops because they give the beginning writer a chance to meet others like himself, providing some moral support. A bad workshop leader would allow vicious criticism, leading to writer's block for both parties. A bad workshop would have no standard for good fiction. Gardner includes \\"creation of a vivid and continuous dream, authorial generosity, intellectual and emotional significance, elegance and efficiency, and strangeness\\" as an example of standards for good fiction.<br /><br /> The third section deals with \\"Publication and Survival.\\" Gardner begins to show his crankiness here. \\"One should fight like the devil the temptation to think well of editors,\\" he says.  He thinks they are, at least some of the time, all incompetent or crazy. They read too much and, as a result, become jaded, not recognizing a talented writer when they see one. He also makes some concrete suggestions, such as to avoid using third-person limited as a sole approach. Apparently, editors look on that point of view as cliched.<br /><br /> The fourth section is called  \\"Faith.\\" Gardner discusses discouragement and recommends some ways to deal with writer's block. One way is to read good writers. He suggests typing several pages of, say, \\"The Dead\\" by James Joyce to acclimate oneself to the rhythms of a great writer. He also recommends keeping a journal: \\"The best way in the world for breaking a writer's block is to write a lot.\\" He extolls the process of writing as well, reminding the beginning writer that most first drafts are flawed. It is only in the process of revision that one \\"discovers\\" what he wants to say.<br /><br /> Certainly Gardner is one strange breed of cat. For instance, when working on a  novel he would write for fifteen hours at a stretch. (I can't even see after writing for three hours.) In another passage he suggests using autohypnosis to give yourself suggestions such as, \\"Tonight I will write with ease\\" Also, in an effort to boost the spirits of the beginning writer receiving a lot of rejections,  he maintains, \\"It's the law of the universe that 87 percent of all people in all professions are incompetent.\\" He doesn't say how he arrived at that percentage.<br /><br /> This is not to say Gardner isn't funny at times. Childishness in a writer, he says, can be a helpful personality trait.  His lack of seriousness about life, \\"his mischievousness, and his tendency to cry, especially when drunk, a trick that makes persecutors quit.\\", not recognizing a talented writer when they see one.

For one thing it's written in first person and the narrator, rancher Sanders Roscoe, holds the point of view throughout the novel. But the story is really about Edith Goodnough, who is being charged with the murder of her brother. Roscoe takes us all the way back to the nineteenth century when Edith's father Roy emigrated to Holt County, Colorado. He and his wife, Ada, have two children, Edith and Lyman. Roy is an ornery cuss who treats his family like possessions. Ada, who longs for her home country in Iowa, soon dies and Edith becomes the mother, a role she will play for the rest of her life.<br /><br /> Sanders' father once had a romantic attachment to Edith but Roy rejects him because he's  part Native American. His father never quite gets over Edith and makes Sanders help out at the Goodnoughs when Roy tries to make Edith work in the fields. She becomes a second mother to Sanders.<br /><br /> These characters are simply amazing. Lyman Goodnough, who escapes his father during WWII and travels the U.S. for most of his life, is a true original. Little Rena Roscoe, Sanders' daughter, adds a little comic relief to the story when she forms an attachment to the increasingly senile Lyman. About the only character from PLAINSONG that's familiar is Sheriff Bud Sealy, who incites Sanders' wrath when he arrests Edith. Believe me, it doesn't matter; this author can make the most transitory character resonate with life.<br /><br /> Kent Haruf  has more compassion in his little toenail than some of our religious leaders have in their whole congregation. When Edith's father dies, she winds up alone. Haruf's description of what this does to a person, sent shivers up my spine. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough. I've read PLAINSONG, EVENSONG and now THE TIE THAT BINDS, and I can't wait for the next episode in the lives of the people who live in Holt, Colorado.	2005-05-07

Like the 87th precinct procedurals, each book is built around several cases. This one is an exception in that Karpo and Rostnikov are working together on the murder of a Russian orthodox priest, Vasili Merhum, and Tkach and Elena Timofeyeva are looking for an Arab girl who has gone missing.<br /><br /> Neither plot is all that compelling, but that's usually not the point in this original series. Kaminsky spends much more time on character development than on plot. In this one, Sasha Tkach is teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown; his wife is expecting a new baby he can't afford and he must learn to work with a new partner, plus put up with his meddling mother who has come to live with them while his wife is confined to bed. There also appears to be more than a little sexual tension between Sasha and Elena. Karpo, the fanatical communist, must learn to live without an ideology to slavishly follow, and he is drawn to the Russian Orthodox church. Rostinikov is being hounded by the remnants of the Russian KGB.<br /><br />  Rostnikov is one of my all-time favorite characters; the \\"Washtub\\" as he is affectionately called, works off stress by solving plumbing problems or by weightlifting while listening to Dinah Washington. Absolutely nothing seems to rattle the man, not even the ax-wielding psychopath who killed Vasili Merhum.<br /><br /> It's been almost four years since the last in the series, MURDER ON THE TRANS-SIBERIAN EXPRESS. In the bio I read, Kaminsky says he spends much more time researching his Rostnikov novels than the others, so maybe that's the reason.

Matt Scudder is now sixty-five, but you wouldn't know it by how he handles himself in ALL THE FLOWERS ARE DYING. The senior citizen private eye is part of the allure of this excellent series. We have seen Scudder age throughout the years and move from a drunk to reformed alcoholic to happily married and semi-retired.<br /><br /> This sequel points back at the last in the Scudder series, HOPE TO DIE. The villain, who Scudder thought was dead, returns to enact vengeance. I had a bit of a problem with that since I couldn't remember much about the book, but eventually Block fills in the gaps.<br /><br /> Some readers will also have trouble with the sex scenes. They are graphic to say the least, and the villain is a part-time pederast. But these scenes are not purposefully prurient; they serve a purpose in the overall structure of the book. They also make the reader want to see this guy get what's coming to him. The villain, Arne Bodeson (among other names) is a worthy adversary for Scudder. At one point he frames another man for the murder of three boys and weasels his way into the prison, pretending to be a therapist. He's even invited to the man's execution. Block uses parallel structure, alternating between Scudder and the villain, creating riveting suspense.<br /><br /> At the beginning, Elaine asks Scudder to investigate a man her friend Louise met on the Internet. She thinks he might be \\"the one\\" but she doesn't entirely trust him. This man is very mysterious and Scudder and T.J. have trouble tracking him down. Meanwhile, Elaine's best friend, Monica, is brutally murdered. The reader can't help but think this is the same man Louise is interested in and this creates additional suspense.<br /><br /> I had a bit of a problem with the ending. After all the excellent setup work, the two leads suddenly get awfully stupid. The almost pathologically careful villain gets careless and Scudder, who's supposed to be protecting his wife, does something a rookie patrolman wouldn't do. Despite this rather serious gaffe, I sure hope the next one doesn't take four years to complete. There's something about the way Scudder wanders from AA meeting to Mick Ballou's bar and back to Elaine's antique shop, that makes the reader want to reread the entire series.man wouldn't do.

US	52809057	R29CSGOKRSZQCK	1841956244	636408141	Midnight Cab	Books	4	4	5	N	N	We want a sequel!	The title of this mystery/thriller is a bit misleading, probably because it was based on a popular radio drama of the same name. Certainly, the main character, Walter Devereaux drives a cab, but that's not the focus of the story.<br /><br /> MIDNIGHT CAB is set in Toronto, Canada, and it starts with a three-year-old boy clinging to a wire fence at the side of a country road. This is Walter Devereaux; he's found and placed in a number of foster homes before he goes to live with the Devereauxs in Big River, Canada. They're an ideal family and he loves them dearly, but he feels he must go to Toronto to find his real parents. He has a letter and a picture of two little girls that he hopes will help him in his quest.<br /><br /> Walter has trouble finding a job but ultimately he finds work at the A.P. Cabs owned by Alphonso Piatelli, who tries to hire him off the books. His night dispatcher, Krista Papadopoulos, soon puts an end to that and a romance ensues. Oh, yeah, Krista just happens to be in a wheel chair.<br /><br /> A parallel story has to do with Bobby Nuremborski, a young boy who hungers for the attention of his father. Bobby will remind you of the killer in LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR. He's gay but he won't admit it; his father would never tolerate a homosexual son. Eventually the two stories intersect leading to some gripping action.<br /><br /> The setting of the story shifts from Toronto to Jamaica, and that's when the novel loses some of its credibility. Like Tony Hillerman, when he moves the story off the Navajo reservation, the author, James W. Nichol, needs to focus on what he knows best. The Canada sequences are believable and compelling, Jamaica not so much.<br /><br /> Despite these quibbles I enjoyed MIDNIGHT CAB immensely and would like to see a sequel. Krista and Walter are likeable characters and the cab company is an ideal setting for a mystery series.	2005-04-20

AMERICAN BRUTUS starts with the assassination of Lincoln. Kauffman quotes just about everybody who was at Ford's theater when it happened: audience members, stage hands, actors etc. Then he moves to the initial investigations and the several law enforcement officers and detectives who were on the trail of the killers. It's hard to keep everybody straight.<br /><br /> Not until Chapter Five do we get a glimpse of Booth's background. His father was also an  actor and seemed to get along well with the \\"rented\\" slaves he kept. Junius Booth Sr. had no problem with negroes eating at the same table. Kauffman suggests that military school may have had something to do with Booth's attitude toward blacks.<br /><br /> Kauffman hypothesizes that Booth saw himself as a Brutus character. According to Booth, Lincoln was a tyrant, like Julius Caesar, who had trampled on the Constitution. In the picture section, we see John Wilkes acting with his brothers in Julius Caesar, although he played Mark Antony to Edwin's Brutus. Kauffman says John Wilkes played many such characters throughout his career.<br /><br /> There are several other illuminating hypotheses in AMERICAN BRUTUS. One would be that Booth tried to implicate anyone he talked to about the plot, plus several other innocent bystanders. He shows how Dr. Mudd was \\"set up\\" by Booth and Surratt. He also shows how Booth tried to do this with Vice President Johnson by leaving him a note prior to the assassination.<br /><br /> Kauffman also works hard at exploding several misconceptions about the assassination. Secretary of War Edwin Stanton is shown taking charge after Lincoln was shot. Far from hating Lincoln, he was genuinely fond of the president. Also, John Wilkes Booth did not break his leg when he jumped from Lincoln's box. Kauffman shows that this notion came from the journal Booth kept during his flight, which was packed with other deliberate fabrications. Most surprising for me, I guess, was Kauffman's portrayal of Lewis Thornton Powell. The myth has it that Powell was insane, but Kauffman shows that Powell's lawyer used an insanity defense during the trail, which may have given historians a wrong idea; Powell was a member of Mosby's Rangers prior to the assassination and faced death bravely.<br /><br /> The trial segment was kind of dull. Eight people were tried by a military tribunal, including a woman. The prosecution did not have to furnish all of the evidence it found to the various defense attorneys. Some of the testimony was faked. Yet, four of the defendants were sentenced to life imprisonment and were eventually pardoned by President Johnson as he left office.<br /><br /> For me, the Coda was the most interesting part of the book as the reader gets to find out what happened to all of the principals later on in life. Henry Rathbone, for instance, who accompanied Lincoln and his wife to the play, never fully recovered from his stabbing and eventually murdered his wife.<br /><br /> Tons of footnotes with occasional commentary within.

The fly leaf of Rebels of Babylon refers to the opening scene as a \\"tour de force of mayhem.\\"  Certainly, Owen Parry is an excellent action writer, but his real forte is characterization. There is no more well-rounded character in American mystery writing than Abel Jones.<br /><br />  Jones is a staunch Methodist, who reads his Bible every day, when he's not chasing voodoo priestesses through the streets of New Orleans. He's also equally dismissive of just about every nationality other than the Welsh. Jones's blind spots set him up for a lot of introspection as the plot winds toward its climax.<br /><br />  In this sixth number in the series, Jones is sent to New Orleans to investigate the murder of abolitionist Susan Peabody who was involved in a \\"Back-to-Africa\\" scheme, having invested over $150,000 of her own money. Jones is aided in the endeavor by Mr. Barnaby, a character first introduced in CALL EACH RIVER JORDAN. All of the other familiar minor characters are mentioned only referentially.<br /><br />  I didn't care much for the plot. Let it suffice to say that there's a lot of B-movie voodoo involved. At one point a lamb is skinned alive by a voodoo zombie, and in the same scene Jones participates in a voodoo mass. The voodoo participants seem to be both good and bad, and I never was able to figure out what their motivation was.<br /><br />  Plot is never the point in one of Parry's Civil War mysteries.  A blurb in the back of the book refers to Abel T. Jones as \\"a character with a voice nearly the equal, in originality, of Twain's immortal Huck Finn.\\" Listen to this: \\"I leaped like an Irish girl at the sound of the fiddle.\\" Another character is bleeding \\"like an Irishman's `eart at the sight of an empty bottle.\\" When he is confronted with a voodoo chant, Jones says the chant did not \\"resemble anything Charles Wesley wrote.\\" Most often the joke is on Abel Jones and that makes it okay when he's overzealous about his religion or makes sport of the French. An Irish cab driver refers to Jones as a runt with \\"that low, Welsh look.\\" You don't find these treasures once or twice in a book; they're on every other page. Perhaps the funniest scene in the whole book is when General Banks reads Jones the riot act. Because of the mayhem at the beginning of the book, Banks thinks Jones is a total screw-up, just the opposite of the way Jones sees himself.<br /><br />  Throughout the book, Jones is complaining about how much he wants to resign his commission and return to his expectant wife, Mary Myfanwy, and their two children in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. This subplot comes to a head in the epilogue when Jones reports to Henry Seward. That's another staple in the Abel Jones series. We're always introduced to a historical figure or two along the way. Again Jones is confronted by an entirely different perception of his personality. Seward thinks Jones would make an excellent politician.of the French.

This version includes an afterward, written after PRESUMED INNOCENT was published.<br /><br /> As a first-year law student, Turow had to study the law of Contracts, Torts, and Property, Criminal Law, and Civil Procedure. A lot of this reminded me of the Paper Chase with professors using the Socratic method in which students are interrogated at length on selected court cases from which they are expected to deduce legal principles.<br /><br /> Rudolph Perini, Turow's Contracts professor, will definitely remind you of Professor Kingsfield. \\"Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, the mornings we have Contracts . . . I'm nearly sick to my stomach. . . . I can't believe it, but I think about that class and I get ill,\\" Turow complains.<br /><br /> Another Paper Chase element is the study group. A small number of students, usually between four and eight, would meet regularly to discuss common concerns. Turow valued his group for its therapeutic function. At first Turow and his cohorts in the study group disdained grades, but that gradually changed as Midterms drew closer. The top five or six people in each 1L section would be elected to The Law Review the next summer. Those elected would glean faculty contacts, the opportunity to teach at a law school, and the possibility of a Supreme Court clerkship.<br /><br /> Some parts of ONE L are rather funny. For instance, students often retaliated against a professor by hissing, \\"a piece of student weaponry frequently used when a professor dismissed a student's comments unfairly or said something hardhearted\\". Another instance would be the night before Midterms when Turow took a sleeping pill, and a Valium, but still couldn't get to sleep. He got up and had a drink, then another, had sex twice with his wife and finally fell asleep at three. Also, on test day, Turow brings along earplugs, paper, four pencils, four pens, three rolls of mints, two packs of cigarettes, a cup of iced coffee, a Coke, two chocolate bars, a pencil sharpener, an extension cord for my typewriter.<br /><br /> We also get to meet a rather famous personage. Turow signs up for Constitutional Law taught by Archibald Cox, but quickly drops the course because Cox is a dull lecturer. There is also the beginning of fundamental change. Nearly a quarter of American law students were now women. In Turow's class ten percent were black, three percent Latin, twenty-one percent women.  The first female president of the Law Review was also elected.<br /><br /> Turow has several suggestions on how to improve Harvard Law school, especially the first year: Smaller classes, more opportunities for students to write and to make contact with the faculty, different formats for evaluation of student performance, election to the Law Review without reference to grades. He also felt that being frightened was more detrimental than motivating. He would supplement case reading with film, drama, informal narrative, and actual client contact.<br /><br /> Turow ends by suggesting more of a practical application. Students should be taught \\"brief writing, research, courtroom technique, document drafting, negotiation, client counseling, and the paramount task of gathering the facts.\\" He would also emphasize legal ethics, suggesting that the general public has a dim view of lawyers, rating them only slightly higher than used car salesmen.  What are the ethical imperatives for a lawyer who is confronted with a client who wishes to save his business, his liberty, his life, by lying under oath? he asks, implying that this sort of thing happens more often than one might think.rettes, a cup of iced coffee, a Coke, two chocolate bars, a pencil sharpener, an extension cord for my typewriter. <br /> <br /> We also get to meet a rather famous personage.

If you're a legal thriller addict, you'll probably like THE MOTIVE; if you're just slumming as I was, you'll probably be reminded of a Perry Mason TV episode.<br /><br /> The two lead characters, Dismas Hardy and Abe Glitsky, are likable if unoriginal leads. Dismas is a fun-loving lawyer who likes to torture his family with Perry Como CDs; Abe Glitsky, deputy chief of inspectors, is a dour type, whose glass is generally half empty, despite the fact that he has worked his way up to a senior position in the San Francisco police department.<br /><br /> Hardy and Glitsky are involved in an arson case in which the two victims were murdered execution style. Glitsky is called in by the mayor because one of the victims, Paul Hanover, is a political lobbyist with whom she has some connections. The lead homicide detective, Dan Cuneo, resents Glitsky's involvement. They become further conflicted when one of the suspects, Catherine Hanover, who just happens to be an old girlfriend of Hardy's, threatens to bring a sexual harassment charge against Cuneo. The twitchy Cuneo retaliates by insisting that Catherine came on to him. Catherine is Paul Hanover's daughter-in-law; she's a suspect because she was at the scene of the fire and she had had words with millionaire Hanover who had intended to change his will in favor of his girlfriend, the other apparent victim in the fire.<br /><br /> Lescroart also adds a subplot during which Glitsky's son is born with a hole in his heart; this further slows the pace, but we get to meet Abe's wife and his little daughter as well as his grown sons from a previous marriage.<br /><br /> The book is divided into the investigation, the trial, and the aftermath of the trial. When Glitsky begins to focus on Missy D'Amiens, the dead girlfriend, the pace picks up. All the while the reader is anticipating the Mason-like  \\"Aha!\\" moment, and Hardy doesn't disappoint. After that the wheels come off as all sorts of FBI and CIA agents enter the picture, the story becoming so far-fetched I almost gave up on it.re, the story becoming so far-fetched I almost gave up on it.	2005-03-21

I'm the type who would buy the Baseball Encyclopedia every couple of years. I ordered Armchair I and Armchair II when they were first available from BOMC.<br /><br /> The Armchair books are coffee table books that include articles by such familiar personages as Peter Gammons, Jimmy Cannon, and Bill James, but there are some real gems such as the article by Moe Berg, written in 1941. Berg may have been the smartest man to ever play baseball. He knew a dozen languages, graduated summa cum laude from Princeton and was a spy during WWII.<br /><br /> If you haven't read Jim Bouton's BALL FOUR, which editor John Thorn calls, \\"The best baseball book ever written principally by a player,\\" ARMCHAIR includes an excerpt. For the uninitiated, this was one of the first \\"tell all\\" books about what happens behind the scenes. The baseball world never forgave Bouton. To this day, he is not invited to old timers' games.<br /><br /> Ever wonder why so many intellectuals love baseball? A. Bart Giamatti, former commissioner and president of Yale University, may be able to explain it in \\"The Green Fields of the Mind.\\" Want to know what happened to Shoeless Joe after he was kicked out of the majors? W.P.

The characters in THE JANE AUSTEN BOOK CLUB discuss all six of Austen's novels, alternating between each other's houses. Each character is assigned a book. The six characters include best friends Jocelyn and Sylvia; Sylvia's lesbian daughter Allegra; Prudie, a French teacher; Bernadette, the oldest member of the group; and Grigg, the only man.<br /><br /> The characters don't spend that much time discussing Austen's novels. Fowler relies on flashbacks to help us get to know each of the characters; several are also going through emotional traumas. Sylvia's husband has left her after thirty years of marriage; Allegra is breaking up with her writer partner; Grigg is falling in love with Jocelyn.<br /><br /> I enjoyed the sassiness of the characters. This is Prudy:  \\"Hadn't Allegra complained to her that Bernadette always did repeat herself? (Hadn't Allegra said this more than once?).\\" Prudy also compares cliques in her school in relation to their drug of choice: Drama (pot); student government (alcohol); sports (steroids); yearbook (glue). Another funny part was when Allegra found out her writer lover was using her personal life in her stories; later on, at a library fund raiser, one of the novelists who's assigned to each table, steals Bernadette's stories about her early career as an entertainer. Good writers borrow; great writers steal.<br /><br /> I also got a kick out of the Grigg character's confrontation with Jocelyn over science fiction. Jocelyn looks down on genre fiction, and spineless Grigg finally stands up to her.<br /><br /> There's not a whole lot of plot in THE JANE AUSTIN BOOK CLUB but the characters are similar to those in Austen in that they seem to learning how to love, as one of the characters puts it.<br /><br /> Fowler also provides an addendum that includes synopses of Austen's books (which will be really helpful when the characters discuss the individual books) and another section where various literary figures and critics comment on Austen's novels, starting in 1812. Most of them loved her. Mark Twain's comment was the exception: \\"Every time I read [Austin] I want to dig her up and hit her over the skull with her own shin bone.\\" One wonders why, if he hates her so much, he's reading her again.Austen's novels, starting in 1812.

Michio Kaku's discussion of PARALLEL WORLDS results from physicists' attempts to reconcile Einstein's Theory of Relativity with that of quantum mechanics to form a \\"theory of everything.\\" M-Theory, the newest form of string theory, allows for the possibility of a parallel universe no more than a millimeter from ours. Kaku believes the newest super collider, which should be ready in 2007, may reveal evidence pointing to this alternate universe.<br /><br /> Another theory, Alan Guth's  inflationary universe theory, argues that the universe expanded much faster than the speed of light (possible because this was empty space that was expanding) and that the antigravity force which caused this original Big Bang still exists, allowing for more explosions, more inflation, and multi-universes.<br /><br /> Also, if we apply the quantum theory to the universe, we are forced to admit that the universe, like an electron, may exist simultaneously in many states.<br /><br /> Kaku asks the question, \\"What might these alternate universes look like?\\" Kaku theorizes that each time a new universe sprouts off from the original the physical laws change, creating entirely new realities. All of this gets even stranger when Kaku projects that all possible quantum worlds might exist simultaneously.<br /><br /> The author does not shy away from controversial issues, such as the Designer Universe. At one point he compares the likelihood of our world occurring by accident to a \\"Boeing 747 aircraft being completely assembled as a result of a tornado striking a junkyard.\\"<br /><br /> PARALLEL WORLDS really gets interesting when Kaku discusses Nikolai Kardashev's  classification of civilizations according to energy output. Type I would have harnessed planetary forms of energy. Type II would be able to consume the energy output of its star and might even be able to ignite neutron stars. Type III has colonized large portions of its home galaxy and is able to use the energy from ten billion stars. Earth is a rather primitive civilization in contrast. Kaku states that if we reach Type I civilization it may launch a time of \\"unparalleled peace and prosperity.\\" But that's a big if, considering the greenhouse effect, pollutin, nuclear war, fundamentalism and disease.<br /><br /> Kaku ends his book with a theological discussion of sorts. \\"If all possible universes exist, what's the point?\\" he asks. In a quantum universe, parallel selves would exist in parallel universes, with \\"different life histories and different destinies.\\" Kaku believes that if string theory is eventually confirmed, providing a theory of everything, one must ask where the equation came from.<br /><br /> The author ends on a high note, seeing this as the most momentous time in human history, a time of transition to a type I civilization, a true paradise on Earth, if we can overcome our self-destructive natures.n stars.

Most baseball fans think the World Series started in 1903 but the National League and the American Association, considered a major league at the time, played for bragging rights in 1882. Twelve other championship series followed prior to the turn of the century.<br /><br /> In GLORY FADES AWAY, Jerry Lansche recounts these series. But he does much more than that. He starts with a history of baseball, taking us back to Alexander Cartwright who formed the New York Knickerbockers; he also changed the shape of the field from a square to a diamond, reduced the lineup to nine, and placed the bases ninety feet apart and codified the rules for the game. Lansche then takes us through the Civil War all the way up to 1869 when the Cincinnati Red Stockings  became the first professional team and 1876 when the National League was formed.<br /><br /> Lansche also places baseball in a wider social setting. For instance, there were over a hundred thousand saloons and three thousand distilleries spread throughout the country. Half the male population visited a saloon at least once a week. Baseball had its share of hard drinkers and baseball players in general were considered roughnecks. Gambling was also a problem. Let it suffice to say that the 1919 Black Sox series was not the first series to be fixed.<br /><br /> Speaking of the Black Sox, I wonder how many people know that the owner Charlie Comiskey was also once a slick fielding first baseball for the St. Louis Browns, who defeated the Chicago White Stockings in seven games in 1885.  Coincidentally, Cap Anson, the first man to reach 3,000 hits also played in this series on the losing side.<br /><br /> Many other Hall of Famers played in these championship series. Hoss Radbourne, the only pitcher to win sixty games in a season, won three games for the Providence Grays in the 1884 series.<br /><br /> Probably the most interesting group was the 1896 Baltimore Orioles who played Cy Young's Cleveland Spiders. The Orioles averaged .328 that year. Hughie Jennings hit .398 with a 112 RBIs. Wee Willie Keeler had 214 hits and scored 153 runs. Muggsy McGraw had malaria that year but he was the heart and soul of the team. But the Orioles were primarily know for their \\"win-at-all-costs\\" attitude, cutting corners on the base paths, snagging an opposing players belt loop on his way around third etc.<br /><br /> Lansche also includes sidebars on \\"The Changing Game.\\" For instance in 1882, the pitching mound was only fifty feet from home plate but the pitcher had to throw seven balls before the batter was given first. In 1887 the number of bad pitches required was reduced to five. A batter could no longer ask for a high or a low pitch. Also in 1887, Cap Anson originated spring training when he took his White Stockings to Hot Springs, Arkansas, prior to the season.<br /><br /> Numerous pictures are included. A young, skinny John J. McGraw pictured in 1899 his hair parted in the middle; \\"hard-drinking, free-spending\\" Mike \\"King\\" Kelly leaning on a bat; an autographed picture of a young Cy Young with a mustache.<br /><br /> This book is a treasure trove of information about a time when baseball was in its infancy; if you love baseball as much as I do, you won't be disappointed.es averaged .328 that year.

Alex Delaware is only referentially mentioned. Petra is involved in two cases, one a drive-by shooting outside a nightclub where one of the victims is a Jane Doe; Petra tracks her down and identifies a possible suspect but has trouble getting the higher-ups to show her any respect. The other case involves Isaac Gomez, who's interning at the station house, doing research on homicide statistics. He finds several unsolved murder cases that occurred on the same day that he's sure are related. Most murder cases involve a gun or a knife. All of these, besides occurring on the same day, were blunt-force homicides.<br /><br /> Isaac Gomez really makes Kellerman's book work. He's entirely convincing, the son of a Salvadoran immigrant who's working his way toward a medical degree when he decides to take a year off to work on another Ph.D. in epidemiology and biostatistics. His dissertation is entitled \\"Discriminating and Predictive Patterns of Solved and Unsolved Homicides in Los Angeles Between 1991 and 2001\\" and this is how he comes in contact with Petra, who is assigned to \\"babysit\\" him. Like many of Kellerman's early mysteries, this one has a psychological theme. We follow Isaac Gomez as he tries to develop his interpersonal skills as well as his genius. He's got a crush on Petra, for one thing, and he's trying to impress her by tracking down the historical precedent explaining the serial killer's chosen date. When a reference librarian enters the picture, Isaac gets instruction in carnal knowledge as well.<br /><br /> Petra also has a mysterious former partner and boyfriend who's working with Interpol on a terrorism case; he's wounded and returns to LA so Petra gets to have a love life as well. He has some issues, though, so there's a feeling of unease about him. He could even be a suspect.<br /><br /> Kellerman's book definitely has some flaws. The climax is rather coincidental for one thing. There's a twist but it's a really convenient twist. But if you compare this work to recent Delaware novels, you've got to give it a thumb's up. I enjoyed it so much I had to give it a four and half, rounded off to a five.twist but it's a really convenient twist.

Foridian Alice Glendenning is a widowed real estate agent who is having trouble getting her insurance company to pay up on a $250,000 double indemnity claim after her husband is drowned in a boating accident. She's trying to start a new career as a real estate agent when someone kidnaps her children and demands the $250,000 as a ransom. About ten pages in, I knew who the culprit was and you should too.<br /><br /> McBain's characters should remind you of those in his 87th Precinct novels. There are two sets of bumbling cops, local Cape October police and the FBI. The locals cops won't take no for an answer when Alice tells them there has been no kidnapping. She believes the kidnapper when she tells Alice she'll kill the kids if she calls the police. Alice's housekeeper reports the crime anyway and stubbornly refuses to shut up about it. She's the one who brings in both sets of investigators. Throw in a curious real estate client, Alice's sister Carol and her truckdriver husband Rafe, and Alice's artist friend Charlie Hobbs and McBain has a lot of characters to keep track of. One of the plot lines, Rafe's search for the \\"funny money\\" the Cape October cops provide as ransom, turns out to be a dead end that McBain loses interest in.<br /><br /> There is quite a bit of suspense involving the accomplices, a black woman and a blonde but even that turns out to be totally unrealistic. An eye witness to the kidnapping misidentifies a man as a woman. Sorry. I don't think so.<br /><br /> Then there's the climax. It reads like something out of Murder She Wrote (not a compliment). As a matter of fact, this whole thing reads like a bad television show. You know you've seen it before, and you wonder why McBain bothered with it in the first place when his real passion is for his made-up city and the cool characters at the 87th.	2005-02-08

He provides the back story of the Mennonite and Norwegian immigrants, the valiant teachers and students, and the Civil War veteran, whose daughter took refuge in a haystack during the storm. The reader learns to care about the participants before the blizzard starts and there is gut-wrenching suspense as the victims head out into the storm. Which of them will survive? Will any of them survive?<br /><br /> The main characters are the Schweizers, Swiss-German Mennonites who had emigrated to America from the Ukraine, the Rollags from Norway, and Walter Allen, a mischievous little boy who adds comic relief to an otherwise tragic story.<br /><br /> The day of the blizzard starts off unusually warm and the kids on their way to school and the farmers working in the fields aren't dressed properly. The temperature drops precipitously and the snow isn't ordinary slow; it's more like blinding sleet.<br /><br /> Laskin is also a weather geek; he provides more than we want to know about the cause of this \\"Storm of the Century.\\" He provides info about lows and highs, jet streams and jet streaks (this little bugger is a main culprit), fronts, and St. Elmo's Fire. He also shows how the Signal Corps weathermen bungled the forecast. It's all very informative but we want to know what happened to the Schweizer children and Will Allen. An especially riveting scene is when Laskin explains hypothermia, using the Schweizer boys as an example.<br /><br /> In an epilogue, Laskin tells us what happened to the survivors and he makes a rather specious statement, suggesting that this storm put an end to the land boom on the Great Plains and that eventually immigrants learned that, although the soil was some of the best in the world, because of droughts and blizzards this land was uninhabitable. Apparently white people are leaving in droves and the land is returning to the buffalo and the Indians.

Deaver does an excellent job making them believable. His fictional characters are also well drawn. Paul Schumann, the protagonist, is a hit man enlisted by the U.S. government to assassinate the architect of German rearmament. Then there's Willie Kohl, a German police inspector who investigates the murder of a man killed in an alley; he quickly latches onto Schumann as a suspect. Kohl is a family man, overweight, with sore feet, but he's a worthy adversary and he will hound Schumann's trail until the last minute.<br /><br /> Deaver has a penchant for wild plot twists, some of which aren't all that realistic; he does it again here but manages to justify this one in the resolution. Perhaps the most impressive thing about the book is the moral dilemma Schumann is presented with during the climax. Willie Kohl, who's on the scene, must make an ethical decision as well. The test of a good climax is presenting the main character with two equally enticing options and Deaver does this masterfully.<br /><br /> The ending is also rather original; let's just say that it's atypical and leaves room for another Deaver series.	2005-01-27

The antagonist is super smart and leads the private eye and female FBI agent around by the nose until almost the last minute. We can also predict that the private eye and the FBI agent will eventually fall into the sack together. And, of course, the FBI agent, Rachel Walling in this case, is persona non grata with the SAC in charge of the investigation. The SAC is a conceited jerk, as is a former student of Rachel's who makes it clear that she, not Rachel, is in charge of the case.<br /><br />The Poet has returned and Harry Bosch, in response to a call from a former colleague's wife, sets out to investigate what looks like a heart attack. The colleague was involved in the original Poet investigation and Bosch finds evidence pointing to the Poet as the perpetrator.  His quest intersects with Rachel Walling's (The FBI agent) when she is called to Nevada to act as a liaison when the poet \\"sends for her\\" via some evidence he's left at the scene of a grisly burial scene.<br /><br />In addition to the above, Connelly has some idiosyncratic writing quirks.  He likes to separate his character gestures from the same character's dialogue. He also gives Harry a first person point of view, while Rachel's scenes are written in third. He also loses track of one of his plot threads.  While tracking down a clue, Bosch stays in a seedy hotel in Las Vegas where he meets a character named Jane. He's interested enough in her to try to search her apartment, but that's the last we see of her. A well-know author once said that if you show a rifle above the mantel, you darn well better do something with it later in the story. Jane is Connelly's rifle above the mantel.<br /><br />The story picks up at the climax, but there's an artificial twist in the resolution that seems to imply that even Connelly knew this wasn't his best effort.	2005-01-17

Put on your thinking cap before you read these stories; they're EXTREMELY literary.<br /><br /> I read excerpts from \\"A Poetics for Bullies\\" in a writing book and was intrigued by the originality of the premise. Push, the bully, doesn't physically abuse the sissies, dumb kids, kids who wear glasses, and cripples he picks on as psychologically torment them. That is until he meets his match, a smart kid who won't be bullied.<br /><br /> Elkin can be ironic as well as in \\"On a Field Rampant,\\" a psychological story preying on that feeling all of us have had at one time or another that we were switched at birth, about a man whose father treats him like a prince (he has a pendant to prove it). He wanders the world searching for his inheritance but when he finds it, he is livid.<br /><br /> I was most impressed by Elkin's endings; in a preface,  he talks about how hard he worked on them; one of them ends with a wink, another with a father's recollection of the look on his son's face when a co-worker catches him stealing.<br /><br /> Elkin also has a very unusual sense of humor. \\"Perlmutter at the East Pole\\" is about a crazy explorer who has been everywhere except New York City, the east pole in the title. While there he meets Rose Gold, a blue-haired old lady that he brushes up against on the subway, whom he decides to seduce.<br /><br /> Yes, Elkin will force you to think.

Reba Lafferty is a very needy and impulsive girl and Kinsey soon takes her under her wing. Eventually she learns that Reba had taken the rap for her money-laundering boyfriend.<br /><br /> We also get no fewer than three simultaneous romances. Henry, Kinsey's eighty-seven-year-old landlord, has fallen for a seventy-year-old woman whom he met on a cruise ship; Reba is still carrying a torch for Alan Beckwith, the money launderer, until she finds out he's been cheating on her with her best friend; and even usually celibate Kinsey falls into the sack with Cheney Phillips, a cop investigating the money-laundering scheme. Grafton handles the sex scenes rather well, concentrating more on what comes before and afterwards than the ex-rated details.<br /><br /> I've read about a half dozen of this alphabet series and if there's one thing I've learned it's that Grafton has an aversion to the jump cut. She's afraid to leave anything out, including Kinsey rearranging her underwear drawer; she should also get a promotional fee from MacDonald's, considering her love for the quarter pounder. There also comes a time in each of these mysteries where Grafton writes herself into a corner. In this one Kinsey and Reba are looking for a hidden room in Alan Beckwith's new office building. They find it but there's a keypad and they don't know the code. No sweat. Reba guesses the combination. Grafton deserves a big COME ON NOW, SUE for that one.<br /><br /> There's no doubt Grafton is limping toward \\"Z\\" but I'll keep on reading her just to find out what she does with \\"X\\". Xerox?

Raymond Obstfeld has written over thirty-five books, ten screenplays and innumerable short stories and poems. He has written literary, mainstream, and genre novels; he also teaches writing at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa, California.<br /><br /> Obstfeld views the scene as a mini-story; it should have a beginning, middle, and an end; it should build to a climax; it should provide resolution. He shows how to use dialogue, point of view, or description to begin a scene as well as such techniques as \\"in medias res,\\" starting in the middle of the action. He also shows how endings propel the reader into the next scene, emphasizing emotions and intellectual impact. He shows how to use cliff-hangers and jump cuts to increase suspense.<br /><br /> A really great suggestion is to outline your scenes on notecards to give yourself an overview of your novel; this will help you avoid too many \\"talking head\\" scenes and help you improve the pace of your novel. He also shows how to improve those talking head scenes when there isn't any alternative, such as in a mystery novel where the detective is doing a lot of interviews. He does this through misdirection, where the main character is involved in some action, such as driving to the airport and getting stuck in traffic. Thus the reader is getting information and is also worried about whether the hero will make it on time.<br /><br /> Another bugaboo Obstfeld addresses is description. Readers often skip this if it's too long, looking for the meat of the story; yet if you skimp on description, you lose credibility. Rather than describe everything the narrator sees, tastes, touches, smells, and hears in a scene, he suggests you focus on one of them, such as describing the smells coming from  fast food restaurants in a working class part of town.<br /><br /> Obstfeld cautions the writer to never play it safe; he actually encourages beginning writers to \\"write themselves into a corner.\\" The character now has no good alternative; both of his choices are unacceptable. What the heck does he do? This forces the beginning writer to think with more depth and his story will be fresher as a result.ative; both of his choices are unacceptable. What the heck does he do?

MacDonald, Carl Hiaasen uses the Everglades as a backdrop for this comic novel. Marine scientist Chaz Perrone has been taking bribes from an agri-businessman to fake his biological tests of the great Florida swamp. On a second honeymoon cruise with his wife, who he feared had discovered his phony reports, he throws her overboard. What he hadn't counted on was that this champion swimmer would be able to make it to shore.  The rest of the novel involves a revenge motif.<br /><br /> I've read one previous Hiassen novel, STORMY WEATHER. I thought the characters were over-the-top, but I got this one for practically nothing so I thought I'd give him another try. I was pleasantly surprised in some respects. Joey Perrone had me at \\"hello\\" and her fifty-three-year-old rescuer and former cop Mick Stranahan had me hoping the old guy would get the girl. My favorite character, however, was homicide detective Karl Rolvaag (an inside joke for anyone from Minnesota) who hates Florida and its oppressive humidity and can't wait to get back to Minnesota. Rolvaag  provides authentic humor as he owns a pair of albino pythons who drive his neighbors to distraction. At one point the pythons escape and Rolvaag is blamed for the disappearance of small pets in the neighborhood.<br /><br /> My problem with the book involves Chaz Perrone; he's just too stupid to be a viable threat. He's also a sex maniac who puts the make on practically every woman he meets. Viagra jokes ensue. There are so many of them that this sit-com effect becomes a subplot in the book.<br /><br /> Hiassen deserves kudos for his treatise on Everglades depletion, but he needs to sharpen his villains. I'm afraid he's planning on bringing Chaz Perrone back for an encore as he's still alive at the end of the book.	2004-12-19

The first hundred pages of SKELETON MAN are as good as anything Hillerman has written. Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee are involved in a diamond caper that takes Chee to the bottom of the Grand Canyon. There's a Hopi myth that relates to the diamonds and Hillerman spends extra time exploring the depths of the Reservation. Leaphorn is still trying to convince his archaeologist girlfriend to marry him, and Chee is trying to adjust to his engagement to Bernie Mauelito.<br /><br /> The problems begin when Hillerman begins repeating himself. Three different sets of characters converge on the Grand Canyon, and they all need to know that the missing diamonds came from a diamond merchant aboard a plane that crashed into another airliner above the Canyon. The diamonds have been showing up repeatedly in the ensuing years, and Leaphorn traces one of them to an old friend who runs a decrepit general store out in the boonies. Hearing this story gets old after you've heard it three or four times.<br /><br /> Leaphorn disappears from the story after he finds the diamond that his friend says had been given to him by a cowboy who traded his knife for it with an old Indian in the Grand Canyon. A kachina figure is stitched on the side of the pouch it was kept in. Either Hillerman forgot about this clue or an editor deleted it because we never hear about it again. Leaphorn always adds credibility to Hillerman's sometimes farfetched plots because he's so deliberate and painstaking during his investigations. We also want to see if Leaphorn is making any progress with the archaeologist; she would know what the kachina figure meant.<br /><br /> One of the characters who converges on the Grand Canyon is the illegitimate daughter of the diamond merchant. She needs to reclaim her father's bones to prove that she is the rightful heir to her grandfather's fortune. Correct me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't the daughter be able to get the same results from her grandfather?<br /><br /> The ending is also incredibly unrealistic and one of the characters gets away with attempted murder. I love the Leaphorn/Chee novels and I will buy the next one in a heartbeat, but Harper Collins needs to give Hillerman the time to make sure he's got all of his ducks in a row before they publish.also incredibly unrealistic and one of the characters gets away with attempted murder.

Only Martin Cruz Smith would choose Chernobyl as a setting for a mystery.<br /><br /> Smith's sad sack detective Arkady Renko is called to investigate the suicide of billionaire Pasha Ivanov, who had dived to his death from his tenth story apartment. Renko finds the suicide suspicious because of a mound of salt he finds in Ivano's closet. Renko's boss, Prosecutor Zurin, readily accepts the suicide and discourages the inspector's investigation. Renko plows ahead undaunted but soon finds himself sent to Chernobyl to investigate the murder of Ivanov's second-in-command, a man named Timofeyev, who'd had his throat slit.<br /><br /> Renko navigates the spooky terrain on a borrowed motorcycle, finding more suspects than he knows what to do with. He also finds refugees, mainly old people, who have returned from exile to retrieve their old lives, despite the radiation.  No one in Chernobyl can keep a pet, because wolves will eat them, hence the title.<br /><br /> Renko does manage to find a love interest among the rubble, but she's got a jealous boyfriend. There's also a touching little subplot involving an orphan that Renko almost accidentally grows attached to. They communicate by phone, although the boy rarely says a word.<br /><br /> Although there are innumerable suspects, a radioecologist, a militia captain, a Jewish American aide to Ivanov, a female doctor, and a couple of hockey-playing hooligans, this is one slow-moving plot. Smith paints himself into a corner in that Renko's only tie to Moscow is his partner Victor who has his own job to worry about. Smith also employs innumerable jump cuts, and the reader finds himself paging back to reacquaint myself with the characters.<br /><br /> Smith pretty much telegraphs the solution to the murders, but there's a scene during the resolution where an elderly refugee couple butcher their pig that saved the day for me. I don't think it'll hurt to say that Renko isn't such a sad sack at the end.	2004-12-02

Kaplan's National Book Award and Pulitzer winner starts with Samuel Clemens' arrival in the East already quite famous due to the popularity of \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County.\\" Almost immediately Clemens sets off to earn his living as a humorous lecturer. Kaplan shows us the many techniques he used such as the extended pause and how carefully he orchestrated his performances.<br /><br /> Clemens' first literary success was INNOCENTS ABROAD about his trip accompanying a group of pilgrims to the Holy Land. It was always one of his most successful books. It was also published by subscription, which means that it was sold pretty much door-to-door.<br /><br /> For me, one of the most entertaining parts of the book was Clemens' courtship of coal heiress Livy Langdon, whose brother, Charlie, had been one of the pilgrims on the INNOCENTS ABROAD trip. She rejected him,  telling him she could never love him. He convinced her theirs could be a brother/sister relationship. Then he fell out of his carriage and she had to nurse him back to health.<br /><br /> Much of the book details Clemens' obsession with James W. Paige's typesetting machine, which eventually bankrupted him. According to Kaplan, Clemens always led a duel existence (hence the title), with Mark Twain, the famous writer and social critic, and Samuel Clemens, the incompetent entrepreneur, always at loggerheads.<br /><br /> Kaplan is almost offhandish when it comes to the early deaths of Clemens' daughters Susy and Jean. Clemens never recovered from Susy's death and Jean's preceded his own by just a few months. His wife Livy had been an invalid several years before her death, partly due to heart problems and partly because of nervous prostration brought on by her relationships with Clemens, but they were married for thirty-four years.<br /><br /> The pictures leave a bit to be desired. We never get a good look at Livy as an adult and Jean and Clara are not shown at all, somewhat surprising since Ken Burns found several for his PBS documentary.g since Ken Burns found several for his PBS documentary. <br />  <br /> <br />	2004-11-24

Madison Davis argues that of all the story elements plot is the most important. Some writers might insist that characterization or theme would trump plot. Davis would answer that we can't know these characters until they actually do or say something. \\"We cannot know a character without that character undergoing a test, that test is the plot.\\"<br /><br /> Much of what Davis says about plot is basic, but even accomplished writers need reminders, especially those that are blocked. One very helpful reminder is that plot is chronological. Even if your story starts in medias res (in the middle) the writer must know the beginning. Davis also stresses a causal chain: problem leads to solution, which leads to another problem, which leads to another solution until we finally reach climax where the story problem is solved. The intensity should also build, the main character's choices becoming fewer and fewer until he must choose at the climax.<br /><br /> Davis also addresses such technical devices as story frames, which can help with suspension of disbelief. In CONNECTICUT YANKEE, for instance, Mark Twain has his main character get hit in the head before he travels back in time to Camelot.<br /><br /> A bone of contention that Davis examines is the plot outline. Some authors worry that an outline may hamper spontaneity but Davis likes them because they give an overall view of the entire plot and help point out problem areas.<br /><br /> Another helpful hint is the superiority of implication to outright statement. Keep back story to a minimum. Davis recommends music playing on the radio, news announcements, or headlines from a newspaper which can help to imply setting while characters are engaged in action.<br /><br /> In the last chapter Davis addresses \\"Ready-Made\\" plots. It is his contention that there is no such thing as an original plot. As a matter of fact, he whittles them down to two: someone goes on a journey, and a stranger comes to town.  Each of us, however, brings an original personality and perspective to the plot and that's where the real writing begins.wever, brings an original personality and perspective to the plot and that's where the real writing begins.	2004-11-23

Luckily, his foster father, a police detective, discovers what kind of person he is and makes him promise that he will vent his spleen only on people who deserve it.<br /><br />Dexter's  foster sister, Deb, also a police woman, wants off of the vice beat (She lures various perverts by dressing as a prostitute). She expects Dexter, who works, appropriately, as a blood spatter expert, to help her get promoted to detective, and she sees an ideal opportunity when another murderer begins to imitate Dexter's Modus Operandi. But she's got competition in the ambitious Detective Migdia LaGuerta, who despises Deborah on sight.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that the author uses first person point of view. Dexter tells us what he is thinking at every opportunity, relishing each new murder as much as the culprit. This slows the pace to a crawl. I kept falling asleep; also the main characters are pretty much cliches. Deborah doesn't do anything except complain, and I've seen versions of Migdia LaGuerta in practically every cop show on TV. The dialogue and attempts at dark humor also fall flat.<br /><br />Author Lindsay creates some suspense when Dexter begins to suspect that he may be killing in his sleep, but the climax ends with a cliffhanger, and there is no transition between the climax and the resolution, leaving the reader dangling. It's hard to believe DARKLY DREAMING DEXTER had an editor.	2004-11-09

Donald Maass is a New York literary agent who seems to spend as much time promoting himself as he does his clients. Maass also does workshops on novel writing throughout the country, and this book, a companion publication for the more-in-depth WRITING THE BREAKOUT NOVEL, incorporates some of the exercises he assigns during those workshops.<br /><br />I have read dozens of writing books over the years; just about always I glean some valuable nuggets from each of them. Maass's workbook is no different. For instance, he suggests that the beginning novelist put off back story as long as possible to add tension and suspense. Maass stresses THERE CAN'T BE TOO MUCH TENSION in a novel. He suggests the writer add tension on every page!<br /><br />Another segment I found useful was his section on plot development. He recommends using layers and subplots to add texture and believability to your work. Subplots are plot lines given to characters other than the protagonist; layers are additonal plot lines given to the main character. He uses Mystic River as an example. Sean Devine is a homicide cop who must investigate the murder of his boyhood friend Jimmy Marcus's daughter; his wife has also left him, taking their baby daughter with her; he also flashes back to the day when the principal suspect, Dave Boyle, was kidnapped by child molesters while he and Jimmy stood by and watched.<br /><br />Maass reinforces his advice by furnishing a sample outline in an appendix. He insists that every novelist, whether he uses an outline in actual practice or not, must provide one for a possible agent or film producer eventually anyway, so he might as well learn how to do one.<br /><br />Beginning writers should understand that writers never quit learning and that they should continually practice their craft. Baseball players and piano players practice continually, why not novelists? WRITING THE BREAKOUT NOVEL WORKBOOK will help you practice and head off possible mistakes.	2004-11-08

PRINCE OF THIEVES is set in Charlestown, Massachusetts, supposedly a breeding ground for bank and armored-car robbers; however, this is much more of a character piece than a thriller.<br /><br />It starts with an extremely impressive bank robbery. Hogan really knows his stuff, as we witness the robbers avoiding \\"dye packs\\" and pouring bleach to hamper forensic investigation. Claire Keesey, the bank manager, is taken hostage (and later released) when an alarm is tripped; and this is when the real story starts. The leader of the stick-up crew is \\"Duggie\\" MacRay, a former hockey player, who falls for the beautiful bank manager. So does FBI agent Adam Frawley, who suspects the bank manager may have been involved in the robbery. Some conflict also exists between Doug and Jem Coughlin, the loose cannon of the group, who pistol whips the assistant manager whom he blamed for triggering the alarm.<br /><br />There are only three holdups during the entirety of the book. This work is much more reminiscent of MYSTIC RIVER and GOOD WILL HUNTING than a thriller. Hogan has the accents and mannerisms of the \\"Townies\\" down pat and he throws in a social issue to boot,  the invasion of Charlestown by Yuppies. All of the robbers resent them and Jem especially sees himself as a Robin Hood character who's more into the high he gets while committing a holdup than the money.<br /><br />Hogan, who lives in Massachusetts,limes Charlestown and the Boston area as a character in the book, using dense description to draw us in. We even get to go to a Red Sox game, especially appropriate during this happy time for Bosox fans.	2004-10-31

Earlier this year DNA results proved conclusively that Lindbergh had a second family living in Germany. And now this. Philip Roth has written a \\"What If?\\" novel portraying Lindbergh as the 33rd president of the United States, having defeated FDR running on an isolationist platform. In short order, Lindbergh meets with Hitler in Iceland, signs a non-aggression pact with the Nazis and the Japanese, and begins a limited resettlement program for the Jews.<br /><br /> As a resident of Little Falls, Minnesota, I was a bit bothered by Roth's apparent assault on a local hero. Little Falls is home to an elementary school, a street, a park and an interpretive center dedicated to Charles A. Lindbergh. Our sports teams are called The Flyers. However, the reader should know that Lindbergh delivered a famous speech for an organization called America First in Des Moines on September 11, 1941, that forever tarnished his reputation (Roth includes the speech at the end of the book). The speech is entitled \\"Who Are the Agitators?\\" and it targets FDR, the British, and the Jews as war mongers. Roth was eight years old when Lindbergh gave the speech. Other anti-Semitics were rampant in the news of the day. Henry Ford targeted the Jews in his own newspaper; Father Coughlin spewed hatred on his radio program. Then there was the Bund, the American Nazi party led by Fritz Kuhn, with a membership of 25,000. Now how would a seven-year-old Jewish boy and his family react to this constant barrage of hatred? If you were going to write a \\"What if?\\" book about a Nazi collaborator president, who would you choose? There was Republican movement to nominate Lindbergh for president prior to WWII and his nomination was a real possibility before the speech.<br /><br /> So then, this book is really about a very real fear Roth had as a child and his giving vent to his imagination, a strategy all novelists employ. Roth inserts himself as the protagonist. He has an older brother, Sandy, who becomes a Lindbergh collaborator when he is chosen to participate in a summer program similar to the Hitler Youth where young Jewish boys are sent to the heartland to live with salt of the earth Americans, a tobacco farm in this case. Sandy is enthralled, as is his aunt Evelyn who falls in love with another Jewish Quisling, Rabbi Bengelsdorf, a  Lindbergh proponent and eventual member of his administration. For me, the most compelling character is Philip's first cousin, Alvin, who volunteers to fight in the Canadian army, joins the commandos and loses a leg in battle. Alvin returns to New Jersey, where he must learn to use a prosthesis and little Philip must help him. Philip is horrified at first until the stump \\"breaks down\\" and Philip must learn to help Alvin wrap it to prevent swelling. He becomes more expert at this than Alvin. This plot line adds some comic relief to an otherwise rather somber novel. Alvin and Philip's father do not get along; Alvin gambles and hangs out with hoodlums and this leads to a combative confrontation.<br /><br /> Roth must have felt a bit skittish himself about besmirching a former American hero because there's a wild twist at the end that rehabilitates Lindbergh to some extent. But not entirely, as Roth feels the need to include the speech and an excerpt from A. Scott Berg's Lindbergh biography in which Lindbergh talks about repelling an infiltration of inferior blood from American shores.when he is chosen to participate in a summer program similar to the Hitler Youth where young Jewish boys are sent to the heartland to live with salt of the earth Americans, a tobacco farm in this case.

I have a hard time understanding what the various detectives are saying and they all seem to have messy personal lives interfering with their sleuthing.<br /><br />The main character, Detective Inspector Tom Thorne, is investigating a series of murders involving men listed on the sex offender's list. The men have been raped and strangled with clothesline. Thorne is falling in lust with an especially comely florist, but, for some reason, is in no hurry to consummate the relationship. Hence the title, LAZYBONES. A burglar has broken into Thorne's flat and defecated on his mattress and Thorne keeps putting off purchasing a new one.<br /><br />Author Billingham, who writes for the BBC, eventually justifies spending all that time showing us Thorne having tea, eating curry, and purchasing a used BMW as it's vital to the ultimate climax, but this does slow the pace considerably. Also, anyone who reads a lot of mysteries should be able to spot the murderer without any problem.<br /><br />Billingham does a good job keeping up suspense as he alternates chapters, occasionally showing us an anonymous murderer as he prepares for his next victim. Another character, Detective Constable Dave Holland, furnishes another apparent diversion as he is a reluctant father-to-be who isn't sure he still loves his wife. Just when you're thinking this subplot has absolutely nothing to do with anything, Billingham places Holland smack dab in the middle of the climax.	2004-10-09

If you're a history buff who doesn't have time to read an 800-page tome with a ton of footnotes, this coffee-table style history of the French Revolution may be what you're looking for.<br /><br />That's not to say VOICES OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION doesn't do an admirable job covering all the bases. For instance, there's a section on the guillotine, believe or not, the result of humanitarian reform. Previously, criminals were burned alive or had their bones broken with an iron bar, then were<br /><br />tied to a wheel to die.<br /><br />VOICES also profiles all of the major players from Louis XVI to Lafayette. We witness Lafayette help draft the Declaration of the Rights of Man, then flee France when the Revolution turns against him, ultimately spending time in a Prussian prison.<br /><br />Many primary sources are included, such as Louis XVI's valet's eye witness description of the royal family's life in prison. A transcript of Louis Capet's interrogation by the president of the Convention is also provided. Later we see Marie Antoinnette, gray at thirty-seven, on her way to the guillotine, facing death with courage and dignity.<br /><br />Just browsing VOICES OF THE REVOLUTION is fascinating. Many of Jacques-Louis David's paintings bring the narrative to life and occasionally the reader stumbles across a truly fascinating account, such as the description of the dechristianization of France, during which time Sans Culottes destroyed religious shrines, stripped churches of statues and often turned them into stables for their horses and we watch as the radicals abolish Sunday and Christian feast days.	2004-10-07

With the possible exception of Hannibal Lecter, no modern villain can hold a candle to McBain's Deaf Man, and with HARK!, he is back to torment Carella and the boys.<br /><br /> This time he is sending them anagrams and Shakespearean quotes, seemingly pointing toward his next caper. Ultimately they determine it has something to do with a violin concert or the theft of a first edition of the Shakespearean Folio, but neither pertains to the 87th and the messages seem to imply that the crime will go down on their turf.<br /><br /> Meanwhile, McBain juggles several other plotlines that flow naturally into each other. Carella is preparing for the double marriage of his mother and his sister and he's not happy about it. Two of the other detectives, Cotton Hawes and Bert Kling, have woman problems, and Ollie Weeks is still looking for his missing manuscript, along with helping out with the Deaf Man.<br /><br /> Since his style is so different from other mystery writers, McBain takes some getting used to. He seems to revel in breaking all of the rules. Throughout this one, he has the detectives gather around Carella's desk, trying to figure out the various messages. At least a half dozen of them contribute and their various contributions can be irrelevant and annoying; they act a whole lot like the Keystone Kops, and I suppose that's the point; McBain is teasing his own characters.<br /><br />Something else I find remarkable is how well McBain mixes elements from the fifties (the first item in the 87th series appeared in 1956) with modernisms. His homicide detectives wear fedoras, for instance, and the apartments of some of the characters are anachronistic as well, but he also incorporates some modern political commentary and the use of modern technology. For instance, Carella's son helps him \\"Google\\" the Shakesperian quotes.<br /><br /> No other author since John D. McDonald has been able to balance mystery writing, social commentary and fun as well as McBain.	2004-09-24

Who could resist a story about a pregnant, redneck girl who moved in to the Wal-Mart to have her baby?<br /><br /> SHOOT THE MOON, a term derived from dominoes which means to try to capture all of the tiles, isn't as good as WHERE THE HEART IS, but it has its moments.<br /><br /> It's about a man who, as he's going through his parents belongings after his mother's death, discovers that he's adopted and returns to DeClare, Oklahoma to find his real parents. He's in for another rude awakening, his real mother was murdered and her ten-month old son went missing at the same time.<br /><br /> SHOOT THE MOON stretches the imagination at times. For instance, Nicky Jack Harjo, the protagonist, is not aware of his American Indian heritage. He'd always thought he was Mediterranean. He also falls in love with his cousin and is grossed out by it until he conveniently discovers she's not his real cousin.<br /><br /> Letts does a good job keeping us in suspense as to who Nicky Jack's real father is and we don't find out who murdered his mother until almost the last moment. You will not be able to predict who did it, so don't even try. The minor characters are rather stereotypical, including a bully sheriff and a drug-addled friend of Nicky Jack's mother, but the ending saves the day. It has elements of a Greek tragedy.	2004-09-17

Sheriff Reichert, the first detective assigned to the Green River case, should have hired a professional to write his book for him. Much of the first two-thirds of the book is filled with complaints about newspaper interference, county executives, the FBI, and political machinations, the implication being that the Green River killer would have been caught much sooner if it hadn't been for their interference.<br /><br /> There is a nugget or two, such as the revelation that Gary Ridgway was a suspect as early as 1984. It seems a victim's pimp had seen her get into his truck and he and some of her family members drove around until they found it; amazingly, the police refused to take them seriously. We also get to listen in on an interview between the investigators and Ted Bundy, during which time he suggests the killer may be a necrophiliac.<br /><br /> It's also surprising that Reichert names so many names; he chides family members of the victims, political opponents, and newspaper reporters, and he's shocked when one of the mothers condemns the Task Force during Ridgway's sentencing.<br /><br /> We see Reichert rise in the ranks, so fast he even surprises himself. Eventually the Green River Task force is disbanded, leaving only one detective (not Reichert) on the case. Reichert brags about having Ridgway in his cross hairs for twenty years, but the real hero was science. The Task Force deserves credit for preserving semen taken from some of the bodies but the scientists who discovered DNA were the real heroes.	2004-09-08

The protagonist is a fifteen-year-old autistic boy who discovers his next-door neighbor's poodle, stabbed to death with a garden fork. He then sets out to discover who did it and write about it as a project for school.<br /><br /> Christopher John Francis Boone is the narrator and he loves to \\"do the maths\\", can't stand to be touched, and hates the colors yellow and brown. He sprinkles red food coloring on his food because he loves the color red. The next-door-neighbor blames Christopher for the death of her poodle and calls the police. When the policeman touches him, Christopher hits him and is carted off to jail. They let him out when his father explains about his \\"no touching\\" policy. His father makes him promise to give up his search for the murderer of the poodle, but Christopher can't help himself. Complications ensue.<br /><br /> What's amazing about this book is how much we identify with Christopher, even though he occasionally wets himself and threatens people with a knife. When he sets off to find his mother, who he thought was dead, we are just as scared as he is. He tries to figure things out logically and is good at it, but then his nerves get to him and he shuts down totally, doing \\"the maths\\" in his head.<br /><br /> Mark Haddon worked with autistic children as a young man, so if one of his goals was to instill a greater understanding for \\"special needs\\" children, he succeeds wonderfully.	2004-09-03

The most intriguing aspect of Chernow's biography for me was its relevance to modern presidential campaigns. No one can read this book without being reminded of the Swift boat veterans political ads. Sparks flew almost as soon as Washington took office. Jefferson, his secretary of state, advocated a weak executive with most of the authority in the hands of Congress and the individual states. Hamilton argued for a strong central government and, as secretary of the treasury, pushed through such programs as assumption of state debt incurred during the Revolution and a national bank. Jefferson objected, claiming the constitution did not convey this kind of executive authority. Both men took up opposite sides during the French Revolution and this led to more fireworks. Today, Fox news promotes conservative issues; in those days, Federalist and Republican newspapers served the same purpose. And this ultimately led to the Hamilton/Burr duel.<br /><br /> Chernow seems to be trying to rehabilitate Hamilton's reputation. Most Americans remember he fought a duel and most recognize his picture on the ten dollar bill; some even know that he was the author of fifty-one of the eighty-five essays in the Federalist Papers. What they probably don't know is that he was the first to address \\"implied powers\\" in the Constitution and as a lawyer he defended one of the above mentioned papers when President Jefferson sued for libel, arguing that truth was a valid defense providing the suspect articles were not malicious in intent.<br /><br /> Although Chernow is a definite Hamiltonian (as opposed to a Jeffersonian) he does not sugar-coat Hamilton's many flaws. Hamilton had an affair with a woman named Maria Reynolds (Can you say Monica Lewinsky?) an apparent con woman. He wrote a political pamphlet condemning John Adams just prior to the election, effectively handing the election to Jefferson, and when Burr challenged him to a duel, he refused to admit he'd said anything slanderous, although he'd been vilifying Burr for years. He was a proud, narcissistic man, who left 22,000 pages of writing. Chernow also uses such words as \\"windbag\\" and \\"prolixity\\" to refer to Burr. He weaves excerpts of Hamilton's writing into the narrative. Hamilton's overblown style is offensive to the modern ear. \\"What the heck did he just say?\\" I asked myself on numerous occasions and had to reread a particular passage again and again.<br /><br /> Chernow wrote this biography to be published on the two hundredth anniversary of the duel, which occurred on July 11, 1804. Chernow refers to Hamilton as the father of our government and implies that he was also the father of our capitalistic system.hough he'd been vilifying Burr for years.

This is the fourth in a series written by a Scottish veterinarian who takes a job in Yorkshire, England, working under Siegfried Farnon. James Herriot, Farnon and his brother Tristan work on all sorts of animals from parakeets to draft horses.<br /><br />James Herriot has a wonderful ability to poke fun at himself, as is illustrated in one of his earliest essays from the first work, All Things Bright and Beautiful, where he clips the beak of a budgie, inadvertently suffocating the poor creature. We then see him struggle to find a replacement for the little bird, its owner's best friend. Later, we watch Herriot's bumbling attempt to court his future wife Helen.<br /><br />In The Lord God Made Them All, Herriot is returning from World War II where he served as an RAF officer; he's married with two children but he still works for Siegfried Farnon. Siegfried will remind you of a character from Dickens. He's an excellent veterinary but his many quirks and foibles make him a trying boss at times. Then there's his ne'er-do-well brother, Tristan. They're constantly fighting and Herriot usually winds up in the middle. The Yorkshire farmers are also fascinating. Herriot has a wonderful facility with dialect and some of the dialogue is hilarious.<br /><br />In the first story Herriot sets out to \\"nip\\" (castrate) a calf. \\"There's nobbut one, Mr. Herriot,\\" the farmer says. \\"An enormous black animal galloped out . . . I stared at the spreading horns, the great hump of muscle on the shoulder and the coldly glittering eyes. It only needed a blast on a trumpet and sand instead of cobbles and I was in the Plaza de Toros in Madrid.\\"<br /><br />Quite often Herriot serves as a psychologist, to his human clients. In one story, Herriot is awakened at one in the morning to treat Myrtle the beagle, whose drunken owner has a guilt complex about leaving his dog alone to attend the races. There's nothing wrong with the dog, but to assuage the owner's fears, Herriot gives Myrtle a vitamin tablet. This happens again and again, and when Herriot finally confronts the owner about the imaginary illnesses, the dog is really sick.<br /><br />Yes, the joke is usually on Herriot, but if your animal is sick, you call James Herriot and sometimes you call him just to talk.<br /><br />These are wonderful, nostalgic stories that take the reader back to a simpler time.

Olson wrote this collection of essays about his years canoeing, snowshoeing, skiing and fishing the Wilderness areas of Superior National Forest and the Quetico of Canada.<br /><br /> The essays are organized according to the four seasons. Olson has an almost metaphysical relationship with the animals that live in the wilderness: red squirrels, loons, otters, even field mice are fellow travelers.<br /><br /> Olson canoes and portages scores of miles to listen to the loons sing on Lac La Croix. He searches hundreds of lakes, looking for the perfect wilderness area, unspoiled by civilization. And he finds it! Saganaga, \\"a symbol of the primitive, perfect and untouched.\\" Later, he hears that a road has come to Saganaga and he ventures back to see what's been done to it. It seems the same until he rounds a bend and is confronted with a modern lodge. He's conflicted; he wants human companionship but he doesn't want to lose his \\"singing wilderness.\\"<br /><br /> In another essay, he tells of \\"flying in\\" to one of the lakes, rather than spending days canoeing and portaging to get there. He feels disoriented and can't really appreciate the experience. He hasn't put in enough effort; he doesn't deserve it. And he never does this again.<br /><br /> Olson is a sentimental, nostalgic man. He tells of catching trout for his grandmother, whom he credits with instilling a love of nature. While fishing on the Manitou, he is confronted with an eighty-year-old trout fisherman who's come to his favorite fishing spot for one last time.<br /><br /> Olson also limns essays that show the brutality of nature. In \\"The Storm\\" we see white-throated sparrows, Killdeers, purple finches, chickadees, and robins returning to the wilderness area after a long and brutal winter. Olson is marveling at their music until snow begins the fall and the temperature plummets. Thousands of confused birds freeze to death.<br /><br /> Admittedly, there is some clunky writing in the SINGING WILDERNESS; one gets the impression that Olson is writing from memory in a lot of instances. Also, at times he doesn't tell you where he is: he refers to the \\"lake\\" as if we should know which one of the thousands in the Superior/Quetico wilderness he's referring to. There's also a dearth of people. Often, he refers to \\"we\\" but the person or persons he's with are invisible.<br /><br /> That said, I think everyone would benefit from reading these essays. I couldn't help but wonder how many people know this place exists. These days the area is called the Boundary Water Canoe Area Wilderness. No motor boats allowed; no ATVs allowed! Everyone should see it at least once in his/her lifetime.e SINGING WILDERNESS; one gets the impression that Olson is writing from memory in a lot of instances.

It's more of a relationship novel.<br /><br /> Henry DeTamble, the main character, is suffering from a genetic defect that causes him to disappear into the past, or future, when he suffers from stress. He has no control over where he will go. Most of the time he journeys back in time to see his future wife, Clare Abshire, starting when she was only six, or his mother who died in an accident when he was a boy.<br /><br /> The two leader characters are extremely well-rounded and there are a number of likable minor characters, including Kimmy, Henry's father's Korean next door neighbor. Niffennegger has employed that writer's adage, &quot;write about what you know&quot; quite well. She is a professor in the M.F.A. program at the Columbia College Chicago Center for Book and Paper Arts. Clare Abshire is a sculptress who makes her own paper and Niffennegger takes us through the process in several engrossing scenes. Henry is a librarian who works in Special Collections at the Newberry Library in Chicago. His father is a violinist and his mother was an opera singer. Although not much of a musician himself, Henry is also a punk rock devotee and Niffennegger weaves minutia about this musical form into the narrative.<br /><br /> Some people may be distracted, or even angered, by the book's unusual structure. Henry is forty when he first meets Clare, but he's twenty-eight when he meets her in real time with no memory of the previous meeting. Huh? you say. So did I for quite a bit of the book, until it grew on me. Niffennegger also toys with scientific plausibility as Henry often goes back in time where he confronts himself. In one especially bizarre scene he even has sex with himself (As a teenager, his partner is only a few months older). Eventually I realized that the book would not work, especially the ending, if Niffennegger wasn't granted this bit of poetic license.<br /><br /> This book is funny, sad, and tragic in different degrees. Henry can't take anything with him when he time travels and arrives naked. He gets caught naked, running around in the stacks at the Newberry. Meanwhile Clare, who loves him as Heloise loved Abelard, patiently waits and always forgives.<br /><br /> If you're looking for something different, you can't go wrong with the TIME TRAVELER'S WIFE.k is funny, sad, and tragic in different degrees.

US	52809057	R3E1ZJ3NBBWLX0	0446310786	994527755	To Kill a Mockingbird	Books	5	8	10	N	N	A twentieth century masterpiece!	I taught this book to eighth graders seventeen times and never got sick of it. Why do I love this book? Let me count the ways:<br /><br /> 1. The protagonist, Jean Louise \\"Scout\\" Finch, is such a great character Demi Moore named one of her daughters after her.<br /> She's funny, smart, and she's got a stronger will than Catherine the Great. Atticus, Scout's father, is almost as compelling. He is willing to defend a black man accused of rape, despite living in racist, depression-era Maycomb, Alabama.<br /><br /> 2. TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a great story we can all identify with. How many of us have known a weird neighbor who refuses to come out of the house? The first part of the book follows Scout and her brother Jem as they try to get a look at \\"Boo\\" Radley. The second half involves Tom Robinson's rape trial and its aftermath.<br /><br /> 3. The book is simply teeming with great vignettes. Jem and Scout are ashamed of Atticus because he doesn't play football, until he shoots down a rabid dog with one shot. Miss Maudie Atkinson's house burns down. Jack, Atticus's brother, makes Scout laugh and is able to painlessly pull a sliver from her hand. The Footwashing Baptists come to town for the rape trial. There are dozens more.<br /><br /> 4. The minor characters are simply wonderful. There are over a hundred (I know because I had my students count them). X-Billups has three sets of teeth. Aunt Alexandra tries to make Scout act like a lady. Cecil Jacobs gets into a fistfight with Scout. Dill, Jem and Scout's neighbor boy develops a crush on Scout and asks her to marry him. Calpurnia, Atticus's housekeeper, acts as a surrogate mother to the children. Bob Ewell rivals Simon Legree as a villain. They're all so real you'll want to visit Maycomb to see if they're still alive. Too bad it's a fictional town.<br /><br /> 5. Many lessons are learned, the most important of which is \\"Don't judge a book by its cover.\\" Mayella Ewell, who accuses Tom Robinson of rape, is actually a sympathetic character. The town's social structure condemns her to a life of drudgery and she grasps at straws. Mrs. Dubois, the old woman down the street from the Finches, who calls Atticus a racial slur, dies brave, refusing to take her medication because she wants to die clean.<br /><br /> This book doesn't get enough credit; it's rarely listed as a masterpiece of the twentieth century. A masterpiece wouldn't be so easy to read. Certainly it's taught in just about every junior high in the country, but it wasn't written for teenagers. The book is a flashback, told by Scout as a grown woman; she uses New York Times' syntax, not S.E. Hinton's.<br /><br /> Some of my students rented the movie instead of reading it page by page. Big mistake. Not only did they fail the test, but they failed themselves by missing out on the best book they'd ever read.structure condemns her to a life of drudgery and she grasps at straws.

Yes, Pico Iyer does live in a monastery for a few days but his main emphasis is an exploration of Kyoto, one of the holiest cities in Japan.<br />The title comes from a Buddhist story about a beautiful woman who tempted a monk, much as Buddha was tempted by an evil god as he sat under the Bodhi tree searching for enlightenment.<br />Pico is an essayist for Time magazine and he is far more interested in the somewhat schizophrenic nature of the Japanese people than he is in Buddhism. His main subject is a housewife named Sachiko who is married to a Japanese &quot;salary man,&quot; who works from six in the morning until eleven at night. His family life is an afterthought. Sachiko loves everything foreign from the Beatles to Mickey Mouse. She calls Pico a &quot;bird&quot; because he is free to wander all over the globe while she is a slave to her husband and two young children.<br />According to Iyer, Japan is close to a utopian society and Kyoto is the cleanest city he's ever seen. Sachiko is a fascinating character. When she introduces Pico to her children she apologizes for their misbehavior although they are much more well-behaved than western children Pico has known.<br />Pico and Sachiko's relationship is perplexing at first. She hints that she might want something more than a platonic relationship. He's wise enough to know that it's the dream of a romance, the romance she's seen in the movies, that she's after.<br />There are some wonderful moments in THE LADY AND THE MONK: Sachiko's mangled English with the occasional Japanese word thrown in and the lack of articles; Iyer's description of cherry blossom time; the albino monk Pico meets when he stays at the temple; the Hanchu Tigers last game of the year when Randy Bass, their American homerun hitter, bows to the fans fifteen times. The fans are just as enthusiastic as they would be if this were a World Series team and not a team thirty-some games out of first.<br />The main emphasis of the book, though, is Sachiko's story arc; we see her beginning to grow away from her salaryman husband, we see her trying to make her dreams become a reality, despite the censure of her mother and friends. We get the impression that the more Japanese women are exposed to the West the more Sachikos there will be.The main emphasis of the book, though, is Sachiko's story arc; we see her beginning to grow away from her salaryman husband, we see her trying to make her dreams become a reality, despite the censure of her mother and friends.

What I knew about Buddhism I'd learned while studying the transcendental writers, Emerson, Thoreau etc. while in college.<br />This book is written by Stephan Bodian, an American Buddhist monk, and Jonathan Landaw, who has led meditation courses at Buddhist centers for over twenty-five years.<br />Despite its cheesy title, this book answered most of the questions I had about Buddhism:<br />Why the heck does the Buddha have so many names? He was born Prince Siddhartha, but once he became enlightened, he was called Shakyamuni Buddha. Bodhi, the tree under which he meditated, means enlightenment. Shakyamuni means enlightened sage of the Shakyas, the clan to which he belonged.<br />Was Buddha God? No, he was a real human thought to have lived between 563 and 483 BCE. When you see Buddhist monks prostate before a statue of Buddha, they are praying to their inner Buddha. They believe each of us has the ability to achieve enlightenment (nirvana).<br />What is karma? Sort of credits you build up, both bad and good. Buddhists believe in reincarnation; karma credits transfer from life to life. So if you're dealt a bad hand; it's because you were naughty in a previous life.<br />What's the difference between Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism? The way I understand it, Theravada emphasizes individual enlightenment; whereas, the Mahayana's proponents are more worried about helping everyone achieve spiritual awakening. A Buddha becomes a Bodhisattva, sort of a savior like Shakyamuni. Theravadas also emphasize compassion and kindness which is pretty much the same thing. Zen Buddhism and Vajrayana (Tibetan) are offshoots of Mahayana Buddhism.<br />What about heaven and hell? This is where they lost me. Shakyamuni taught that suffering resulted from something called the &quot;Wheel of Life.&quot; A diagram shows a pig (ignorance) giving birth to a rooster (desire or attachment) and a snake (aversion or hatred). There are also six realms of existence: God, anti-God, Human, Animal, hungry ghost, and hell being. Primarily through meditation and compassion, an entity can build up enough karma to work its way up to God. But the gods can be demoted if they run out of karma and they are always fighting the jealous anti-gods, so apparently they are not Buddhas. This wheel of life has existed in infinity; one of the authors says to remember that an enemy was probably at one time your mother, so it should be easy to forgive.<br />At times Landaw and Bodian take their transcendental philosophy a bit too far. The last section deals with &quot;uninvited house guests.&quot; By this they mean insects. According to Buddha killing mosquitoes and other pests is bad karma. If a mosquito makes its way into your house, you're supposed to catch it and take it outside.

In the first part, Maisie is setting up shop as a private investigator. A man hires Maisie Dobbs to follow his wife, who he thinks is cheating on him. She follows this woman to a graveyard where she stands over the grave of a man named Victor, just Victor. Maisie finds out from the caretaker that this man was a war veteran whose face had been hideously defiled. There are other graves in the graveyard without a surname and Maisie is suspicious.<br /> The second part is flashback. We see Maisie rise from a maid, to a student at Cambridge, then a WWI nurse. We see her getting up at three in the morning to read the books in her employer's library. When she is discovered, rather than fire her, her employer takes her under her wing to assure her an education.<br /> In the third section we return to Maisie's investigation of a suspicious farm called The Refuge which had been formed as a haven for WWI veterans who had been deformed in battle.<br /> Although sometimes over-earnest with a plot line that's a bit too convenient, Maisie Dobbs is a worthwhile read. The likeable lead, the setting, and the theme of soldiers with little to live for kept me turning the pages with relish. Jacqueline Winspear is also smart enough to keep you guessing about what happened to Maisie's doctor lover right up until the end. The book is also peppered with enjoyable minor characters that help round out the personality of our Maisie.	2004-07-02

Ann Napolitano's WITHIN ARM'S REACH is a hard book to get into, mainly because of the structure. It's written in first person with multiple viewpoints. Just when you get used to one, that character disappears for twenty pages and sometimes more.<br /> The reason Napolitano chose to structure her novel this way is because the story is about a family rather than one single protagonist. These are the McLauglins and the Learys, an Irish-American family with more in common than they realize.<br /> At the beginning Gracie Leary, a member of the third generation, discovers she's pregnant by a boyfriend she was just about ready to dump. Gracie has been promiscuous since she was fifteen, so no surprise there. Twenty-nine-year-old Gracie works for another ex-boyfriend as an advice columnist. As a result, it's hard to believe how bent out of shape her family gets when they discover she's in the family way.<br /> Gracie's grandmother, Catharine McLauglin, is the center of the family, but she's failing. She has a car accident, then later falls and breaks her hip. She's thrilled that Gracie is pregnant; she feels children will revitalize the family. She's has nine children herself, three of whom died at birth or very young. She also has visions of her dead children and her Irish mother, whom she'd always considered crazy. Catharine's mother was about the most interesting character in the book. During lightening storms, she'd hide in the closet and say her rosary.<br /> Lila, Gracie's younger sister, is a medical student with a photographic memory. She has whizzed through the first two years of med school but is having trouble with practical application since she has no bedside manner.<br /> Kelly, Catharine's daughter, is having an affair with her husband's best friend. Napolitano's theme that family members are more alike than dissimilar is best illustrated when we compare Kelly and Lila. Kelly also has a photographic memory. She also prefers to be alone. She goes so far as to rent a motel room for the purpose.<br /> Louis, Kelly's husband, is a real estate speculator and construction contractor who loses one of his men in a fall. He feels responsible and it's tearing his marriage apart.<br /> The last major character is Noreen Ballen, the wife of the man who died in the construction accident. She is hired to nurse Catharine. She is also one of the little Irish kids that Catherine sees in one of her visions, all thirteen of them tied to a tree by their overstressed mother. Symbolic or what?<br /> Most of this is pretty depressing. I couldn't find anyone to identify with. Most of these people are unrelenting sad sacks.

Their mother had left the family shortly after Cutuk's birth. Cutuk idolizes the Eskimo hunter and tries to look like him by pushing down his nose. Cutuk wants to kill a wolf so he can be more like the Eskimo hunters but doesn't want to invoke the wrath of his nature-loving father.<br /> There isn't much plot. We see Cutuk, sometimes called Yellowhair, age to twenty-three. He lives in Anchorage for a time but feels as much an outsider there as he does in Takunak, the Eskimo village a day and half dogsled ride from the igloo. Enuk gets lost and Cutuk goes looking for him; Cutuk tries to win the hand of Dawna, the Eskimo girl he thinks he loves.<br /> Perhaps the main thrust of the book is Kantner's portrayal of the Eskimos Cutuk encounters when he visits their village. They're not exactly &quot;noble savages.&quot; They hunt wolves with AK-47s; they get drunk on Aqua Net, they bully yellow-haired white boys almost incessantly, imitating kung fu movies, and they commit suicide. Modernization and welfare checks have decimated the aboriginal culture.<br /> This can be a hard book to read. It is liberally sprinkled with Eskimo words. Kantner provides a glossary at the front of the book. Kantner overdoes it a bit, making sure there's Eskimo terminology on practically every page. Words like &quot;quaq,&quot; which means frozen fish and &quot;arii,&quot; and expression of hurt or disappointment. They are sometimes unnecessary and destroy the flow of the book, especially during dramatic scenes.<br /> Would I recommend this book? Absolutely; the exotic setting alone makes it worthwhile and the Eskimo dialect is hilarious.	2004-06-24

He's married his longtime girlfriend Weather and he has two kids. He's torn down his bachelor pad in St. Paul and built the \\"Big New House.\\" He also now works for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.<br /> It is in this capacity that he is sent to Duluth to investigate the murder of a Russian sailor. A Russian police officer named Nadya Kalin joins him there. He suspects she's really an intelligence officer.<br /> Sanford also gives us a first-hand look at the murderer, a fourth generation member of a Communist sleeper cell who's still in high school. Another pivotal character is a homeless person who witnesses the crime and decides to keep the money she finds in the victim's money belt and to lay low. Assorted FBI agents and Iron Range police officers meander in and out of the plot. The leader of the sleeper cell is a ninety-two year old great-grandfather who had been a member of the Cheka, forerunner of the KGB.<br /> I've read most of the \\"prey\\" novels and have always been most impressed by the banter going on between the principals. In this one it starts with Lucas's home life. Weather, a surgeon with little patience for garage-door-openers, crashes into the garage. Lucas's first thought is that his Porsche may have been damaged. He then goes on to sooth her feelings, knowing better than to say what he really thinks. The same kind of teasing happens with Nadya. During some down time, she's watching \\"Legally Blonde\\" and is puzzled by the impractical plot. Lucas convinces her that it's a true story. She says, \\"You're joking me, right?\\" This becomes a standing motif throughout the rest of the book, Nadya not understanding American idioms and Lucas joking her, but the former lady's man can't do much more than that because he's now married.<br /> The change of scenery is welcome. We get a good look at Minnesota's Iron Range, Duluth harbor, and the great north woods, but the ending leaves a bit to be desired.

As a history major I learned dribs and drabs about the English monarchy but never really looked at the family tree, so to speak. There's a lot in ROYAL PANOPLY I wasn't aware of.<br /> Carolly Erickson starts with William the Conqueror and works her way all the way down to Queen Elizabeth II. I don't know if it's Erickson's cynical tone or William the Conqueror's suspect genes but these monarchs suffer in the telling. Sadists, ne'er-do-wells, spendthrifts, and the mentally ill abound.<br /> Many of them begin their reigns as forceful kings. Henry II brought order to a land \\"plundered and battered by oppression\\" but ultimately wound up being responsible for the murder of his former friend, Thomas Becket. Henry V (Prince Hal) conquered the French at Agincourt but his religious scrupulosity contributed to his death at only thirty-four. Even William the Conqueror died alone, his body robbed by his servants.<br /> Erickson pulls no punches with modern sovereigns. Queen Victoria, after the birth of a son with hemophilia, turned on Prince Albert accusing him of hardheartedness, thus contributing to his early death. Erickson has even less regard for Queen Elizabeth II. We learn that it has been some time since she and Prince Phillip have slept in the same bed, due to Phillip's affair with another woman. According to Erickson, \\"the throne has become a symbol, not of moral force, but of moral vacuity.\\"<br /> Carolly Erickson's organizational approach leaves a bit to be desired as well. There is quite a bit of repetition as she begins each new biography, but just when you're looking for a recap, as in the case of the ascent of the Stuart kings, you don't get it. James I of Scotland took the throne because of Mary Queen of Scots's claim but we never do find out how she was related to the previous monarchs. One bit of misinformation that is cleared up, however, is that England was invaded more than once after William the Conqueror in 1066. King Edward IV, who had been temporarily deposed, invaded from the Low Countries, unseating ineffectual and insane Henry VI and having him put to death. Also, William of Orange invaded after James II tried to reinstate Catholicism. He was invited by several members of Parliament but not officially. James could have defended his crown but panicked and left the country without putting up a fight.<br /> One thing we can definitely learn from reading PANOPLY is what a ludicrous system of government monarchy really is. The British were stuck with some of these people. All we need to do is look at George III-IV. George was thought to be insane (actually he had Porphyria) but his son was worse. He was a drunk and a womanizer who never bothered to be at all discreet. The man made Prince Charles look like Mother Theresa. And if you think he may have been an anomaly take a look at Edward VII, Victoria's successor.

In Sara Nelson's book SO MANY BOOKS, SO LITTLE TIME, the author tells us she could not relate to PLAINSONG, that she put the book aside in favor of other books she'd rather read. How could it be, I wondered, that this national reviewer could scorn one of the best novels I've read in the last ten years?<br /><br /> I would assume that once again Nelson will be less than enthusiastic about the sequel. EVENTIDE is one slow-moving story. Haruf fashions scenes where a welfare couple shops for TV dinners at a supermarket. In another, a boy and girl clean out an old garden shed and play Monopoly. In yet another, the McPheron brothers sell their steers at an auction. I don't know how he does it, but Haruf makes these seemingly mundane scenes work. I guess it's because of the heart-tugging humanity they express. We know these people; we see ourselves in them.<br /><br /> I will admit it took me a while to warm to this book. Tom Guthrie and his boys are minor characters for one thing, and as a former teacher, I could relate to him. Right around page ninety or so, this becomes Raymond McPheron's book and you have to be a heartless jerk not to want to hang around with such a mensch. Raymond and Harold are having a hard time dealing with the loss of Victoria and her daughter Katie, who've gone off to college.<br /><br /> Haruf's style is quite spare, but there are hints of Faulkner and Hemingway. Haruf does for Holt, Colorado, what Faulkner did for Yoknapatawpha County. As in the Faulkner novels, the characters are a motley crew. There's a clueless welfare couple who can't seem to do anything right. DJ Kephart, a pre-teen version of Raymond, shepherds his grandfather through pneumonia and stands up for a woman in distress. The welfare couple's uncle is a veritable Simon Legree.<br /><br />  Haruf has the same lyrical cadence as Hemingway. Listen to this: \\"They left the corrals and walked across the gravel drive to the house and porch where they slapped the dust off their jeans and stomped their boots and went inside and took off their warm jackets and hats, and Raymond washed his hands and face at the sink and started to cook at the old enameled stove.\\" Hemingway, right?<br /><br /> For whatever reason, Haruf also disdains quotation and question marks, and he will often begin a scene without making it clear whose viewpoint it is, leaving it to the reader to figure it out from context clues. The ending will also be disappointing for some. It fades out and lots of the threads are left unresolved, just as in real life.<br /><br />  Eventide is a blue-collar book with blue-collar characters and blue-collar sensibilities and definitely worth your time and money.ent inside and took off their warm jackets and hats, and Raymond washed his hands and face at the sink and started to cook at the old enameled stove.\\" Hemingway, right?

Most of these are nothing more than pulp fiction. Bayard's Dickens parody, on the other hand, complements the original in many ways.<br /> MR. TIMOTHY does justice to Dickens in the way Bayard handles the grown-up Tim. Besides the limp, this Tiny Tim is nothing like the original. He's a cynical chap who's disappointed in himself for taking Scrooge's money. He's reduced to working in a bawdy house, teaching the madame how to read and write.<br /> The plot is rather predictable. Bayard has transplanted a repugnant 21st century curse to the 19th century, pederasty. A young girl is found dead, branded with the letter &quot;G&quot;; then another girl is found with the same brand on her upper arm. The cause of death is unknown but the dead girls have frazzled, bloody fingernails. A homeless waif, Philomela, seems a likely candidate to become the next victim, and Tim becomes her protector.<br /> Like Dickens, Bayard does his best work with minor characters. There's an Artful Dodger named Colin the Melodius, who serves as a sidekick to Tim. Then there's Gully, a retired sea captain who trolls the Thames for dead bodies. Timothy sometimes moonlights for Gully. Like Dickens, Bayard gives each of these minor characters a memorable characteristic. In Gully's case it's cats. His landlady is a cat lover; she has dozens of them, and they drive Gully crazy. But without a good villain you don't have much of a story and there's a good one here, in razor-wielding ex-policeman Rebbeck.<br /> Timothy is also haunted by the ghost of his father. He sees him everywhere, but when he tries to make contact the man transforms into a stranger. Philomela has the same affliction.

Although the title is taken from a Superman comic, FORTRESS OF SOLITUDE is definitely not about super heroes (although the lead character is given a magic ring by a homeless man who appears to have the ability to fly).<br /> This is a book about race relations. It begins in the seventies, just as the gentrification of the Gowanus area of Brooklyn begins. Dylan Ebdus is only six years old. His father is an experimental film maker, his mother an idealist who believes in the importance of Dylan associating with children of color. As a result, she sends him out into the streets to confront the blacks and Puerto Ricans who frequent Dean Street. He is repeatedly &quot;yoked&quot; (put in a headlock and robbed) by blacks wandering through from the Projects. Although he's not very good, he plays stoopball with the kids on his block, when they'll let him. When he's given the ring, Dylan suddenly becomes a gold-glove center fielder.<br /> Dylan's life changes when a new boy moves into the neighborhood, Mingus Rude, the son of a rhythm and blues singer at the nadir of his career. Having been raised in an affluent area of Philadelphia, Mingus is as much of a neophyte as Dylan, but he quickly learns the argot of the streets and becomes Dylan's protector. Dylan shows him the ring and Mingus quickly appropriates it. The ring will remind you a lot of the one in Lord of the Rings.<br /> The story moves in slow increments until, at the end, Dylan is a somewhat shiftless adult, working as an early morning disk jockey and free-lance writer. Mingus is in jail, having been convicted of manslaughter.<br /> There is a minor theme dealing with art. Dylan's father spends interminable hours working on an abstract film that apparently drives his wife away. Mingus uses the ring to paint graffiti (tag) on the side of a prison in the neighborhood. Expert taggers cover &quot;toys&quot; wannabes without the skill to compete. Much of the book also deals with music. Dylan loves rhythm and blues and soul music; he pretty much disdains rap, although he occasionally refers to it and quotes some lyrics.<br /> The black youths from the Projects are portrayed as thugs with few redeeming qualities, but Lethem does present them as strangely polite. &quot;Could you loan me a dollar?&quot; they say, just before they yoke Dylan. One of Dylan more persistent tormentors calls him by his first name.<br /> Lethem leaves the reader hanging in respect to some of the plot threads, but this book will definitely make you think and is more realistic than magic.ic; he pretty much disdains rap, although he occasionally refers to it and quotes some lyrics.<BR> The black youths from the Projects are portrayed as thugs with few redeeming qualities, but Lethem does present them as strangely polite. &quot;Could you loan me a dollar?&quot; they say, just before they yoke Dylan.

Somehow I got the idea that the zoo animals aboard the life boat were anthropomorphized. Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br />Richard Parker, the tiger, is one of the most vivid animal characters I have ever read about. He just jumps off the page.<br /> Life of Pi is divided into two segments, before the shipwreck and after. The first part deals with Pi's life in India with his zoo keeper father and his mother and brother. We learn a lot about zoo animals and how well they adapt to their pseudo environment, and this leads right into Pi's religion. He belongs to three of them: Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. He sees merits in all three. Martel hints at similarities between the holy men and the animals. They all mark their territory and when it is discovered that Pi belongs to three churches he is ostracized by all three, because YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE! There are humorous moments in this segment such as when we find out Pi is named after a swimming pool and that his nickname was &quot;Pissing,&quot; short for Piscine.<br /> If you're bored by the first half, hang in there, the second half will knock you over. It is simply riveting, and Pi is one of the smartest sixteen-year-olds I have ever encountered. His duel with Richard Parker is more entertaining than Siegfried and Roy.<br /> As you're reading, you will encounter scenes that strain credulity, but don't get too cocky. Yann Martel has anticipated your disbelief. The ending is masterful and leaves you with something to think about after you're finished reading, as all really good books do. It's also very funny. The Japanese interviewers are a hoot.	2004-04-21

She shifts back and forth from \\"modern times\\" to 1593, the year of Marlowe's murder. During the modern times segment, Silbert's hero, private eye Kate Morgan, is called to investigate the attempted theft of a 16th Century manuscript compiled by Thomas Phelippes who had worked for Sir Francis Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth spymaster. According to Silbert, Marlowe was a spy for Queen Elizabeth and he became embroiled in the Sir Robert Cecil, Lord Essex rivalry.<br /> Another plot thread, during the modern sequences, has the Slade Group, an off-the books CIA company whom Morgan works for, trying to save one of their operatives, who had been tortured in an Iranian prison.<br /> The Marlowe plot thread works well enough, but the modern-day stuff is awfully convoluted, and when Silbert tries to pull everything together, the whole thing folds like a pup tent.<br /> If you'd like to read about the actual Marlowe murder, Silbert suggests THE RECKONING: THE MURDER OF CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE by Charles Nicholl.	2004-04-17

Although the lead character will remind you of Travis McGee in respect to his physical prowess and verbal dexterity, he is also the owner of a bookstore and a book scout.<br /> The story starts when an old woman, Josephine Gallant, asks Cliff Janeway to help her win back her grandfather's Richard Burton collection. Her only clue is that she knows the name of the bookstore, still in business after a hundred years, that had cheated her mother out of the books and papers her grandfather had left for her in his will. She dies but Janeway, an ethical sort, feels obligated to fulfill his promise.<br /> This is where the second unusual element unfolds. Janeway's sidekicks are women. One of them, a former librarian named Koko Bujak, taped Josephine under hypnosis, during which time she regressed to when she was a young girl and would discuss Burton with her grandfather, Charlie Warren. The other woman is a love interest, Erin D'Angelo, a lawyer negotiating for the purchase of Burton's journal.<br /> The action shifts from Denver, to Baltimore, to Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, with lots of ambience along the way.<br /> Dunning uses the hypnosis tapes to introduce us to Charlie Warren and Sir Richard Burton. Surprisingly, this is the dullest part of the book. Nothing much happens. Charlie is suspicious that Burton may be spying for the British, Burton has an affair. That's about it. The modern stuff is highly entertaining, with Dunning adroitly handling plot twists with just enough character development to keep us interested.<br /> You can't go wrong with this one. Dunning keeps you pulling for that big lug Janeway throughout, no matter how brutal his methods.	2004-04-14
US	52809057	R2ENH1KHN3NS8H	0743244850	264539370	Are You There Alone?: The Unspeakable Crime of Andrea Yates	Books	2	18	35	N	N	Huntress on the prowl!	Suzanne O'Malley is a huntress on the prowl, out to prove that everybody connected with the Andrea Yates case was incompetent. I found the book to be extremely disjointed and tedious. O'Malley pads the book with psychiatric interviews that go nowhere. She even resorts to jury selection to fill up pages. There is one new tidbit, specifically that Andrea Yates was bi-polar before she got married and that her pregnancies pushed her over the edge, but that would be material for a magazine article, not a 262-page book.<br /> O'Malley maintains that Andrea Yates was misdiagnosed and that one psychiatrist especially, Mohmammed Saed, was especially delinquent. Yates tried to commit suicide twice before she drowned her children and she was at one time committed to Devereaux Texas Treatment Network, where Saed was on staff. He prescribed several anti-depressants rather than Haldol which had worked for Yates in the past and never seemed to bother to see his patient. The anti-depressants may have exacerbated her problem. There is one especially funny sequence where O'Malley plays investigative reporter, making an appointment with Saed and complaining about not being able to get right down to work as a journalist, suggesting that she may have ADHD. He prescribes Wellbutrin.<br /> At first it appears O'Malley will focus on Michael Woroniecki, an itinerant preacher the Yates were involved with. Yates had contended that she drowned the children to save them from Satan, that because they were so young and innocent they would go to Heaven. She, Satan, would be annihilated. O'Malley infers Woroniecki was partially responsible. He told Andrea that she was a bad mother and that she was going to hell, supposedly because she let them watch cartoons and would not spank them when they were naughty. This guy is the most interesting character in the book but, alas, O'Malley couldn't get him to agree to an interview.<br /> The huntress returns when the psychiatrist for the prosecution contends that Yates was imitating a segment from the television program, Law and Order, during which a woman drowns her children in a bathtub. O'Malley, a former scripter for the show, checks it out, learning that there was no such program. But, this being Texas, the judge refuses to declare a mistrial. O'Malley takes credit anyway, claiming that if it had not been for her sleuthing Yates would have got the death penalty.<br /> Overall this book reads like one of those quickie exposes that come out after a headline disaster, only those are usually written in two weeks. It took O'Malley two years to write this one.Yates was imitating a segment from the television program, Law and Order, during which a woman drowns her children in a bathtub.

Generally, I prefer character-driven stories to plot-based, but there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Richard Russo illustrates this in EMPIRE FALLS. Ostensibly it's about the trials and travails of Miles Roby, a restaurant manager, who's worried that the town dowager, Francine Whitney, will go back on her promise to leave him the restaurant when she dies. Empire Falls is a dying mill town and Francine owns everything including most of the people.<br /> Things get complicated when we discover that Miles's mother had an affair with Francine's husband, the owner of the defunct mills, and that she's taking it out on him.<br /> Miles also has a daughter named Tick, the epitome of teenaged angst, who is having difficulty dealing with her father's impending divorce. Then there's Miles's younger brother David, who may or may not be the dead mill owner's son; Miles's reprobate of a father, Max, who steals from his son every chance he gets; a gay priest, who functions as Miles's confidant; a town cop with a low self image; Janine, Miles's soon-to-be ex and former fat person; and Janine's fianc&eacute;, Walt Comeau, a gym owner who is constantly challenging Miles to arm-wrestle.<br /> Most of these characters are given their own viewpoint and there lies the problem. Russo gets inside their heads and stays there for pages at a time, telling us what they're thinking, and just when we get interested in one of them, he switches perspectives. The pace is glacial. It took me over two weeks to read the thing.<br /> That said, EMPIRE FALLS can be hilarious at times. For instance, Tick's art teacher teaches a low-level class that she divides into different colored tables. When the blue table acts up, she says, \\"Why can't you people act more like the green table?\\" Two of the students at the green table are absent; one is asleep, and another is studying algebra. As a former teacher, I can really relate. Then there's Miles's father Max. He's a hoot. At one point he decides he wants to go to the Florida Keys, but he has no money, so he cons the senile parish priest into stealing money from the collection box.<br /> There is a violent climax that I have to admit I did not see coming, although Russo practically tells the reader what's going to happen. If you have the time and patience, Empire Falls may be a good one to dip into.to the Florida Keys, but he has no money, so he cons the senile parish priest into stealing money from the collection box.<BR> There is a violent climax that I have to admit I did not see coming, although Russo practically tells the reader what's going to happen.

BEYOND BELIEF compares the Gospel of John with the Gospel of St. Thomas found among a cache of texts near Nag Hammadi in upper Egypt in 1945. Pagels suggests that both were written about the same time, about sixty years after Jesus's death. John emphasizes belief in Jesus Christ as god (something that is not implicit in the gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke); Jesus is a supreme being, separate from man and if we are to be saved we must believe in him. Thomas, on the other hand, argues that God's light shines within and that we should seek to know God through our own, divinely given capacity.<br /> Parts of BEYOND BELIEF are quite compelling, such as Pagel's portrayal of early Christians living by the Golden Rule, even during the plague when they stayed with their fellow Christians while everyone else ran away to save themselves. Non-believers saw this and wanted to be part of this compassionate religion. Most of the book, however, deals with how the New Testament came about. Pagel gives most of the credit to early church father Irenaeus who emphasized the Gospel of John and put it above Matthew, Mark, and Luke although it was written later. Pagels argues that the Gospel of John may have been a response to the Gospel of Thomas, since it is the only one that shows St. Thomas doubting Christ when he appeared to the Apostles after rising from the dead.<br /> A later chapter deals with Christianity after Constantine's conversion when he called together catholic bishops to form the Nicene Creed, during which time many of Irenaeus ideas were given an official stamp. A later bishop, Athanasius, called for the destruction of &quot;apocryphal&quot; texts and it was most likely then that St. Thomas's gospel was hidden at Nag Hammadi. Athanasius wanted right thinking among his subjects and warned against something called &quot;epinoia,&quot; or spiritual intuition, &quot;a deceptive, all-too human capacity to think subjectively, according to one's preconceptions.&quot;<br /> If you're expecting a thorough analysis of the Gospel of St. Thomas, you won't find it here (although Pagels does refer the reader to other scholars who discuss it extensively). You will, however, find the entire text in an appendix. Some of it is quite enigmatic, especially saying 114 in which Peter asks Jesus to make Mary Magdalen leave since &quot;females are not worthy of life.&quot; Jesus promises to make her male &quot;for every female who makes herself male will enter the Kingdom of Heaven.&quot; Much of St. Thomas's Gospel is every bit as enigmatic.'re expecting a thorough analysis of the Gospel of St. Thomas, you won't find it here (although Pagels does refer the reader to other scholars who discuss it extensively).

Thomas Jefferson's brother Randolph for one. Apparently he couldn't be trusted to manage his own affairs and one of Jefferson's slaves refers to him as \\"one mighty simple man--used to come out among the black people, play the fiddle and dance half the night.\\" Unfortunately, this account is only one-page long, and Farquhar makes no mention of the fact that it may have been Randolph rather than Thomas who impregnated Sally Hemings.<br /> Some of the other highlights (or lowlights) from GREAT AMERICAN SCANDALS involve James Buchanan's sexual preference; J. Edgar Hoover's vindictiveness; and some direct quotes from Richard Nixon's Oval Office tapes. And there's an especially eerie section on what happened to some famous corpses, including Tom Paine's and John Paul Jones's.<br /> The section on the Salem Witch trials shows how duplicitous human beings, even young ones, can be. According to Farquhar, life in Salem was so dull that the girls made the whole thing up to get attention.<br /> Despite the rehashing of some well-known historical episodes, SCANDALS is a fast read and well-worth the cost of the book.	2004-02-26

I love nurses, especially World War II nurses who never got their due, despite their stalwart courage in the face of Axis bombing and shelling.<br /> AND IF I PERISH traces the nurses' involvement from their landing (at the same time as the regular troops) in North Africa, to Sicily, to Anzio and the push northward in Italy, to the Normandy invasion, to the invasion of Germany and finally to the liberation of Nazi concentration camps.<br /> 30,000 nurses served in combat zones on the front lines of every American battlefield and yet they were treated like second-class officers. Most of them received \\"general\\" commissions, never rising above second lieutenant. Enlisted men were not required to salute them. Back home they were often viewed as prostitutes and lesbians. A woman living among unmarried men? What sort of woman would subject herself to that sort of scandal?<br /> Unfortunately, the writing in AND IF I PERISH doesn't do these women justice. Hardly any of the nurses come alive and only one of the wounded soldiers is mentioned by name. Two of the nurses, however, are very memorable. Lt. Claudine \\"Speedy\\" Glidewell, who was almost killed when her hospital ship was bombed by the Germans, and Lt. \\"Frenchie\\" Miernicke. Frenchie tells off an uppity surgeon who treats her like a servant, and in the most touching anecdote in the book, Speedy's grandson, rather than do a report on Cleopatra, chooses his grandma instead.<br /> Two incidents show the bravery of these remarkable women. When the American troops landed at Anzio their advance was stopped by the Germans and they were hemmed in near the harbor for months. There was no fallback position for the hospitals and the Germans would hurl artillery shells over the nurses tents, sometimes coming up short sometimes overshooting, sometimes scoring a direct hit. Yet the nurses stayed and did their duty. Also, during the Battle of the Bulge, the chief nurse was told to choose five nurses to stay behind to help patients who could not be moved. This was immediately after seventy some troops had been massacred by the Germans. Yet when she asked for volunteers more than fire volunteered, risking imprisonment or death.<br /> Sixteen army nurses were killed by enemy action, 201 lost their lives due to illness or accidents. Many nurses received the DSM, the Silver Star, the DFC and the purple heart. Yet, when they returned home they were expected to return to their old roles as homemakers.

Elvis doesn't get to do much. He doesn't even talk, so that's a big let down.<br /> Odd Thomas, the protagonist, not only communes with Elvis but also sees many different dead people, including a potential mass murderer who has targeted Pico Mundo for a wholesale slaughter. When Odd first notices the man, he is alive but is being followed by strange creatures called bodachs, who portend violent atrocities. Later, he finds the man's body in his bathroom and this leads Odd on a wild chase to find the man's accomplices.<br /> Most interesting for me was how Dean Koontz deals with suspension of disbelief. Although he is a short order cook and has no greater ambition than to work in a tire store, everyone in Pico Mundo respects Odd Thomas, including chief of police Wyatt Porter, who has learned from experience not to doubt Odd. So, if everyone in the story accepts what's happening as the status quo, why not the reader?<br /> Being the cynic that I am, I was less than enthusiastic until Odd's parents are introduced towards the end of the book. Both of them are sociopathic. Odd's mother is especially menacing, threatening Odd with a gun when he asks her for help. I began to think that this might be a psychological mystery, until things reverted to form with a rather typical team of killers being revealed. They're introduced earlier in the book, but you'll never be able to pick them out. Believe me.<br /> Another interesting and original element of the book was when Odd speculates that the bodachs might be creatures from the future whose &quot;bodies&quot; could not make the trip. A bit of satire, since they're enthralled by violence, just like we are.	2004-02-09

The producers seemed more interested in \\"looping,\\" a Traveler mating ritual, than anything else. Shiny, sequenced-dressed preteens with bouffant hairdos and makeup were eerily similar to the child beauty queen.<br /> George Gmelch, an American anthropologist, spent a number of years living with the Travelers at Holylands, a Traveler haven in Dublin. This book is a compilation of that research. In it we learn that the Travelers were originally Tinkers or tinsmiths who wandered throughout Ireland looking for work, relying on farm families. They also did a bit of begging and outright stealing on the side, hence their nefarious reputation. During the potato famine of the 1840's up to a million Irish starved and another million emigrated, some Travelers among them. Those that stayed experienced difficulties after WWII when farming became mechanized and the need for tinkers decreased.<br /> Gmelch's book concentrates on the Irish government's attempts to settle the Travelers in permanent housing. They ran into difficulties with settled Irish because of their penchant for scavenging scrap metal and begging. Like other minorities the Travelers did not adjust well to public housing, but did much better when given an opportunity to purchase their own homes.<br /> According to Gmelch the Travelers are family oriented, unwilling to trust anyone outside the immediate family. They also have an adversarial relationship with the settled Irish, who look down on them because of their lack of education and their enthusiasm for drink. This results in a bit of one-upmanship during horse trading and such.<br /> Probably because of Gmelch's academic background, much of the writing is pedantic, kind of surprising when we're talking about some of the most interesting and humorous people I've ever heard of. He does, however, reveal some of the reasons why the American Travelers behave the way they do. For instance, many Travelers in Ireland marry close relations and we see the reason for this in their distrust of everyone, including unrelated Travelers.<br /> This book involves Gmelch's sojourn at Holylands between July 1971 and September 1972 and a return trip in 1975 which lasted four months. Gmelch includes an Update outlining the status of the Travelers as of 1984. As of 1984, more Travelers were dependent on welfare than on scavenging. Horses were almost gone and more families relied on cars and vans. Begging was also in decline. As of 1981 only fifty percent of Travelers were living in trailer caravans. Forty-six percent were living in houses or chalets.<br /> Many Travelers resist the government's efforts to settle them in public housing, preferring their independent, wandering lifestyle. As of 2003, during a visit to Ireland, I witnessed them parked in their caravans alongside country roads.ns why the American Travelers behave the way they do.

I have to say that the PBS rendition was one dramatization of fiction that I thought was superior to the original. But, thank god, John Mortimer lives!<br /> Much of RUMPOLE AND THE PRIMROSE PATH has to do with Rumpole's return to chambers after a heart attack. The old codger is still as cantankerous as ever. We see him resisting SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED'S efforts to force him to lead a more healthful existence. At one point she has him riding a stationary bicycle at a health club. Imagine Leo McKern on a stationary bike!<br /> I've always been impressed with the ensemble cast in the Rumpole stories and they're all back. SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED is the epitome of the scold. Soapy Sam Ballard, leader of chambers and a Q.C. (Queen's counsel, Queer Customer to Rumpole) illustrates England's strange hierarchal legal system. They have law clerks, solicitors, barristers, queen's counsels, all on an ascending scale. Rumpole is clearly superior to Ballard as a lawyer and one of the stories shows Rumpole upstaging his so-called leader. Then there's the pathetic character, Claude Erskine-Brown, married to Phillida. He leads a delusionary existence where he's some sort of Don Quixote-like Casanova and of course Rumpole is his unwilling confidant. Liz Probert has taken Phillida Erskine-Brown's place as Rumpole's junior. There is also a new character, Liz Gribble, director of marketing and administration at chambers. She's an annoyance but as the stories progress she becomes rather of an Rumpole ally.<br /> Part of RUMPOLE OF THE BAILEY'S allure is the humor involved. Rumpole's relationship to the Timsons crime family, his lust for Chateau Thames Embankment, and his never-ending feud with SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED are sidesplittingly funny.	2004-01-24

I'm still impressed with how simpatico these two guys are.<br /> Anyway, I wasn't aware that this was a series and now that I've read another one, working my way backwards, I'm not as impressed.<br /> First off, there are too many featured characters in RELIQUARY. FBI agent Pendergast doesn't even show up until well into the story; yet we have Dr. Margo Green; police lieutenant D'Agosta; Dr. Frock; Smithback, the reporter; Simon Brambell, the medical investigator; Snow, the diver; Hayward, the female police officer; plus a host of minor characters who have their own perspectives just before they're dusted by the wrinklers. It's hard to know for whom to cheer and there's too much distance between each account. It's often necessary to page back to see where they were when last encountered.<br /> Also, maybe I'm too much of a left-brainer but I didn't believe those wrinklers for a second. These two guys seem to be obsessed by monsters and the underworld. In STILL LIFE WITH CROWS it was a cave bigger than the Carlsbad Caverns and a Kong character with the mind of a baby. In this one it's the underworld beneath New York City and a collection of genetic monstrosities.<br /> The most interesting aspect for me was the author's note at the end of the book. I knew there were a lot of uncharted abandoned tunnels beneath NYC but not thirty stories. As many as five thousand &quot;houseless&quot; have lived there; they form their own communities and communicate by tapping on pipes. Even more remarkable is the authors' claim that the Astor Tunnels actually did exist. THE MOLE PEOPLE by Jennifer Toth is a factual account of the homeless beneath the city.	2004-01-19

Uldrich and Newberry compare November 9, 1989, with the day the Wright Brothers flew at Kitty Hawk. This was the day two IBM scientists coaxed individual atoms to build a structure, the IBM logo.<br /> As a result, nanotechnology, the science of manipulating material at the atomic level, was born.<br /> I had heard Bill Gates talk about many of the advancements mentioned in this book, but I had no idea they were so close. Some of them are being produced already. Embedded nanoparticles are being used to make stain-repellent khakis, for instance. Also, in 2001 Toyota introduced bumpers that are sixty percent lighter and twice as resistant to scratching and denting.<br /> Uldrich and Newberry predict that in ten years Nanotechnology could be a trillion dollar industry. Two companies, Nanosys, Inc. and ZettaCore, are working on constructing computer circuits that will create a 10,000-fold increase in computing power. Some applications could include tiny computers embedded in your clothing to monitor your health. In the health field, nano-sized drugs, because they are undetectable by the body's immune system, can reduce or eliminate side effects.<br /> One of the reasons Ulrich and Newberry are so optimistic is because of the industry jumping that nanotechnology will engender. They use Hostess Twinkies as a hypothesis. R&D for the company may spend money studying vitamin supplements and aroma therapy (to increase taste sensation).<br /> And there's good news for environmentalists. According to a Nationa Science Foundation official, \\"nanotechnology applications have the potential to save four hundred million gallons of gas annually and emit eleven billion fewer pounds of carbon dioxide into the air.\\"<br /> Remember that anthrax scare? According to Uldrich and Newberry \\"two separate nanotechnology-related products will be able to render anthrax harmless\\" by the end of 2003.<br /> Much of what Uldrich and Newberry have to say is aimed at businessmen who may wind up extinct if they don't pay attention to nanotechnology. For instance, titanium dioxide nanoparticles can break down and loosen dirt smudges from materials, leading to such applications as a coating for new cars with self-cleaning nanoparticles. Car washes and gas stations beware!<br /> Even more stunning is Uldrich and Newberry's prediction that within ten years nanotechnology will help cure blindness and hearing loss: \\"... parts of our bodies that already operate at the nanoscale, such as the retinal cones and rods that allow sight and the stereocilia in the inner ear that allow hearing, can be replicated.\\"<br /> If you're thinking that much of what I've said is \\"pie-in-the-sky,\\" you should know that the National Science Foundation pegs the \\"probability of the type of commercial applications covered in this book actually occurring within the next fifteen to twenty years\\" within the 90 to 100 category.n to nanotechnology.

I'm always looking for a unique perspective in a mystery, and as a longtime Antique Roadshow fan, I was drawn to Jane Wheel's job as a antique \\"picker,\\" somebody who finds unique \\"stuff\\" for dealers.<br /> Jane has an avocation as a detective, working for Bruce Oh, whose wife is in trouble. A dealer has turned up dead and Claire Oh is a suspect because the dealer accused her of trying to sell him a phony chest of drawers.<br /> Jane and her partner Tim Lowry set off to Campbell and LaSalle's, an artist's colony that also does furniture restoration, to try to exonerate Clair. When they get there, Jane discovers a body, a man face down in a pool of water, an apparent suicide or accidental death.<br /> The trouble with the lead character is that she can't seem to focus. If I were a doctor, I'd diagnose ADHD. The chapter headings offer a clue as to what this book will be like. They're from a book entitled, OVERSTUFFED. Because she was so occupied with collecting, Jane forgot to sign a permission slip for her son and he wasn't allowed to go on a field trip. Now she feels like a bad mother and she's determined to eliminate the clutter from her life. So, every so often, even in the midst of an important clue as to what's going at Campbell and LaSalle's, Jane will be distracted by her bulging purse, her cell phone, a good-looking man, some delicacy she's having for lunch, or by her sidekick, Tim, who's always pulling practical jokes on her. The plot is extremely thin and the resolution is even thinner. The characters are stereotypical. There's a gay man, an inscrutable oriental and a nagging mother. What's really hard to believe is that this is the third in a series. St. Martin's was one of the last to reject over-the-transom submissions. If this is the best they can do, they really ought to go back to the slush pile.	2004-01-05

I have always been more impressed by the humor in the 87th Precinct mysteries than the police procedural. For instance, in FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH, McBain uses Lewis Carroll's nonsense poem \\"Jabberwocky\\" to create a single used in a video as a sendoff for a new singing sensation, Tamar Valparaiso. This gives McBain a chance to lampoon music critics, TV entertainment news, and civil rights advocates who carry political correctness too far.<br /> The plot revolves around the kidnapping of Tamar off a river yacht. Steve Carella soon finds himself playing second fiddle to the FBI and their advanced technology. But, surprise of all surprises, Tamar's record producer insists on Carella accompanying him when he pays the ransom.<br /> Something else you usually get when you read the Grand Master is a brutal twist when you least expect it. He will stop at nothing. I'm kind of surprised he hasn't killed off Carella by now, especially since he's been working at the 87th for something like fifty years.<br /> All of the above would not make a great mystery. This is also a character vehicle. Ollie Weeks furnishes the sub plot, still romancing his fellow police officer, Patricia Gomez. A while back McBain made up his mind he was going to transform the mysogynistic, racist Weeks into an almost likable human being, but rather than do it all at once he's been chipping away at the big fellow for two, three books now. First off, Ollie decides to take music lessons, then he writes a book, a police procedural of course, and now he's dating a Hispanic police officer and learning how to play \\"Spanish Eyes\\" for her. He even takes her to see a movie about the making of Richard III.<br /> McBain pretty much telegraphs the resolution of this mystery when Tamar's record goes through the roof, but the interplay between the characters, as they say in those credit card commercials, is priceless.	2003-12-27

The second is much more compelling than the first.<br /> Someone has been sending Gordaoff threatening letters and Shugak is hired to protect her. She needs the money to help provide for her dead lover's son, whose mother wants him back, apparently just to spite Shugak. And that's what's wrong with this book. Everybody has it in for Kate Shugak. It's like President Nixon said about Reagan, &quot;She's just not a pleasant person to be around.&quot; Shugak also locks horns with Gordaoff's campaign manager, Darlene Shelikof, with whom she attended The University of Alaska, Fairbanks. She doesn't get along with men any better, even those she's attracted to, like state cop Jim Chopin whom she thinks is condescending.<br /> After two members of Gordaoff's staff are murdered, the murderer comes looking for Shugak. It's especially galling for Shugak when Chopin saves her. I found the resolution to be about as believable as the Kennedy conspiracies. Stabenow can't get the two stories to jibe and so she pounds a square peg into a round hole. I also kept paging ahead to see where the good-time girl story continued.	2003-12-22
US	52809057	R37D5FFSV1AMEX	0679422587	559569265	In the Cut	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Wow!	This novel reminded me of LOOKING FOR MR. GOODBAR. The protagonist is another teacher, only this time she teaches creative writing to ghetto youth. Early on in the book, a young red-headed woman is brutally murdered. Frannie, the protagonist, is almost an eye witness as shortly before the murder, Frannie observes this same woman giving head to a man she thinks is a homicide detective named Malloy. Much as with the GOODBAR character, Frannie seems to be courting disaster, as not long after she's having sex with Malloy in the Captain's office at the precinct station. Susanna Moore keeps you wondering, though, since Frannie has all sorts of strange friends. There is Cornelius, one of her students, whom she invites back to her apartment. There's John Graham, a medical student, who's<br />been seeing a shrink and having blackouts. Any of them could snap at any moment.<br /><br />Susanna Moore is not at all inhibited when describing sexual encounters between Frannie and Malone. You could even argue that this book is more about female gratification than it is about serial killings. Frannie tells the story in first person, hence the writing sounds more like a journal than traditional narrative. There are few transitions between scenes; Moore cuts<br />from scene to scene as in a movie.<br /><br />Frannie is also working on a slang dictionary and Moore inserts many of these interesting idioms into the narrative. A \\"hamster,\\" for instance, is a black person. \\"Broccoli\\" is pubic hair. \\"To lash\\" is to urinate. These entries generally concern sex, racism, and homicide detective lingo. The<br />implication is that working homicide does something to a man's soul.<br />The ending is absolutely riveting. As usual I finished at two in the morning and was not able to get back to sleep! Since Moore breaks writing convention, you will not be able to predict the ending. As a matter of fact, my first reaction was, \\"NO FAIR!\\"	2003-12-15

I've read all of the so-called writing gurus, John Gardner, Janet Burroughs, Dwight Swain etc., but this is the one that has been most helpful.<br /> Don't be put off by the title. This was how Robert Ray wrote his first novel; I don't think he means to imply that everybody should write only on weekends.<br /> If you're a beginning writer, Ray will take you from idea all the way through three rewrites. The first thing he will do is help you get to know your characters. You will write a back story for each of your main characters, you will come up with a time line, and you will dress them for business. When you finish they will start to come alive for you.<br /> Next he will provide a structure for your novel, something I've been led to believe is the biggest problem for beginning novelists. Ray uses the Three Act method. Act one is where you show the problematic situation and bring your main characters on stage. Act Two is where you build complications. Act Three is the climax and resolution for your novel. Ray will help you fashion plot points that will help you write all the way to the end. There are three of them, plot points one and two and midpoint, which will give you targets to aim at. Ray also emphasizes chains of events before and after each plot point which will further hold your work together.<br /> Every time I start a new novel I skim over the WEEKEND NOVELIST. The man clears things up. I had no idea how rhythm worked in a novel until I reread this book. The scales have fallen from my eyes. What's really surprising is that the book is out of print (Used copies are available). It was originally a Dell Trade Paperback but I got it from Writer's Digest Book Club. They need to republish this baby; it will enhance their somewhat suspect reputation.	2003-12-10

I reread THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST as part of a writing exercise, and guess what? It was better the second time around.<br /> The novel begins with Macon Leary and his wife Sarah in a car returning from a vacation that was supposed to help them deal with the murder of their son, Ethan. Macon doesn't want to talk about it because that would force him to deal with his feelings. Sarah asks for a divorce.<br /> The other main character in the novel shows up when Edward, Ethan's dog, begins to act up, assaulting Macon's boss, Julian. He calls in a dog trainer and this is where the novel really begins to heat up. She recognizes Macon as a possible catch and she's not the type of person to be denied. If you've seen the movie, she's nothing like Geena Davis. She's more of a trailer-park type who loves thrift stores. She has fly-away hair that refuses to take a comb. When Sarah decides she wants Macon back, the conflict becomes one of who will he choose, Sarah or the bohemian Muriel? Muriel shows her pluck when she follows Macon to Paris where he's working on an update of a guidebook for businessmen, hence the title, the ACCIDENTAL TOURIST. Macon hates Paris; he pretty much hates every place that isn't Baltimore. He thinks the people are rude and ethnocentric, but every single Parisian he encounters when in Muriel's company is a saint. She helps him see the City of Light through her eyes. She even finds a thrift shop in Paris.<br /> I was most impressed by the job Tyler did with her minor characters. Edward the dog holds the novel together. Without him, Macon would never have met Muriel. Every time the novel needs an addition boost, Edward provides it. Then there's Rose, Macon's spinster sister, whose marriage to Julian creates an additional complication for Macon. She's a female version of Macon who shares Macon's &quot;geographic dyslexia&quot; and wonders back to the home place shortly after her marriage.<br /> This novel is a real hoot and if you haven't read it because you've seen the movie, you're really missing out. As usual the book is much better than the movie.the movie, you're really missing out. As usual the book is much better than the movie.	2003-12-10

Beginning writers can learn a lot from STILL LIFE WITH CROWS. Preston and Child take a farfetched plot and make it believable by working overtime on research. They show us an imaginary town in Kansas beset by a &quot;serial killer,&quot; but they also spend extra time teaching us about tornadoes, turkey processing and spelunking.<br /> I was also impressed by how seamlessly Preston and Child work this information into the plot line and it's hard to tell where Preston leaves off and Child begins, their styles are so compatible.<br /> Add two great characters to the mix and you have a page turner on your hands. FBI agent Pendergast shows up in town to investigate the murder of a relic hunter whose body is found in a small clearing in a corn field surrounded by crows skewered on ancient Indian arrows. Blond-haired Pendergast wears expensive black suits and imported shoes; his deductive abilities will remind you of Sherlock Holmes, but his idea of a Watson is young Corrie Swanson, an eighteen-year-old misfit with purple hair and metal dangling from every orifice. He hires her and her ancient soot-belching Gremlin to drive him wherever he needs to go.<br /> There were a couple of things about the book that didn't measure up. One was the serial killer with the super human strength. Preston and Child's explanation doesn't adequately explain where it came from. Also, the relationship between Corrie and Pendergast is a bit iffy. We never do find out what Penergast's motivation is. That said, I have to give this one five points for entertainment value, if nothing else. I couldn't wait to get back to it.	2003-11-28

If you're like me, you'll look at the pictures first and the first person you'll see is the murderer. This doesn't really ruin the story however because the people involved in these serial killings are so stimulating. Stowers takes us through each of the four Wichita Falls murders, introduces us to the suspects and the police officers involved, and occasionally lets us in on the killer's thoughts. We get to know Terry Sims, Toni Gibbs, Ellen Blau, and finally college student, Tina Kimbrew, whose murder is totally incomprehensible, since she treated the murderer better than any other woman had in his entire lifetime. Apparently he realized this, too, as he gave himself up after her murder (But never confessed to the other murders). Incredibly he only spends eleven years in jail due to good behavior.<br /> This is where former bricklayer, John Little, enters the fray. He's an investigator for the Wichita County DA. It has been fourteen years since the murders and Little has been given the cold case by his boss, Barry Machak. Incredibly, he finds a telling clue immediately. This isn't so hard to believe since it was right there all along, and the other detectives just never followed up on it. And, of course, they didn't have DNA analysis.<br /> Another riveting part of the book was when the Kimbrews agree to try to come to terms with the murderer of their daughter. They go to the prison to talk to him. He's become a Born Again Christian and he assures them that he never really meant to hurt their daughter, that he's never harmed anyone else before or since. The wife forgives him and the husband is about to until John Little begins to make connections between the four murders.<br /> I was a little upset at first that Stowers spilled the beans so early but once I got to know the victims, their families and various law officers I was totally into this book.	2003-11-19

Much as Bret Ellis did in AMERICAN PSYCHO, Guterson is sticking his neck way out here.<br /> The plot is fairly simple. A young girl encounters The Blessed Virgin Mary in the woods while digging mushrooms. Before she knows it, she's got two thousand pilgrims breathing down her neck.<br /> The trouble with this scenario is that Ann Holmes is a homeless person who's been known to smoke marijuana now and then and is also not averse to eating magical mushrooms. And she's not even Catholic! Guterson has fun making sport of Ann's devotees; much of the book is a satire on religious groupies whose gullibility is too much to believe.<br /> The setting for OUR LADY OF THE FOREST is Washington state; Guterson adds a little environmental conflict in the person of Tom Cross, an out of work logger whose life is slowly swirling down the toilet. He feels responsible for his son's paralysis and he latches onto Ann of Oregon as his possible salvation.<br /> Ann is a shy young girl and all of this hullabaloo is a little bit too much for her. That's where Carolyn Greer comes in. She takes on the role of Ann's spokesperson. She doesn't believe a word of this but she knows a goldmine when she sees one. She's a sort of Jimmy Buffett character who needs to earn money so she can winter in Mexico and some of the money meant for a Our Lady's new church sticks to her fingers.<br /> The other main character is a first-year Catholic priest who lives in a trailer home; his church smells of mildew and he's thinking of leaving the priesthood. When he meets Ann, he's enticed by her Kate Moss, heroine-babe sexuality.<br /> All of this is a whole lot of fun if you don't take religion too seriously and I guess that's the point Guterson is trying to make.	2003-11-14

This is the South Dakota Badlands and the main characters raise alfalfa, and other crops. The plot revolves around the accidental death of Matti Remmel's husband and a secret he's been hiding from her the past few years. That plot thread soon runs out of steam, and the book becomes more of a relationship novel: Matti and an archeologist who wants to dig on her land; her daughter Shelley and her former high school English teacher; and Dawn, Mattie's eccentric hired hand, and a Mexican neighbor with a secret of his own. Then there's the runaway Indian boy Mattie takes in. All of them are working on building trust.<br /> Sometimes Nelson spends too much time trying to prove he knows all about alfalfa ranching, as he devotes pages and pages to irrigation, fixing flat bed trucks, and building a new kitchen after Dawn sets fire to the ranch house. Otherwise, he does a bang-up job writing women characters and sex from a woman's perspective.<br /> Nelson throws in a brutal ex-boyfriend for Dawn who is instrumental in moving the novel toward a climax. Dawn is perhaps the most self-sufficient and toughest of the three women. She can fix anything and she adds a bit of humor to an otherwise angst-filled novel.<br /> These characters are so real they make those on the MTV program seem cartoonish.	2003-11-04

Perhaps the most interesting thing about VENGEANCE IN MY HEART is that William Clark Quantrill, the leader of the Lawrence raid, lived in Lawrence prior to the war. He was a teacher and an abolitionist who participated in raids of Missouri, helping to free slaves. He was also run out of town, accused of thieving and cheating the Delaware Indians. When he switched sides he claimed that he had been working undercover to avenge the death of a brother at the hands of the Jayhawkers. There was no brother. This tidbit lends an aura of personal revenge as a possible motivation for the raid when we consider that many of the raider captains were opposed to it.<br /> The author describes VENGEANCE IN MY HEART as a &quot;novel of the civil war.&quot; Yet David K. Moore used only &quot;reported dialogue&quot; gleaned from diaries, memoirs, interviews, and newspapers. According to an end note, the work is a &quot;true and complete&quot; account of the Lawrence Raid. About the only thing lacking to make this a bonified history is an index and a bibliography. But it's definitely not a novel.<br /> The book details family after family giving its account of its male members being brutally murdered. They were asked if they were from New England or Missouri. If they answered in the affirmative, they were killed since the raiders were after abolitionists and Missouri Unionists.<br /> We also get to meet James Henry Lane, leader of the Jayhawkers. Quantrill's spies had informed him that Lane was not at home, but he was, living in the most ornate mansion in town. He managed to escape by hiding in a cornfield behind his house.<br /> Perhaps the most interesting and disturbing character in the book is raider Larkin Skaggs, a Baptist preacher who believed in an eye for an eye. He has a definite story arc and we watch him kill townsman after townsman, then stay too long and suffer a fate similar to his victims.<br /> Something else I wasn't aware of was that when the raiders finally left Lawrence, the Union cavalry was hot on their trail and that they came close to trapping them several times.<br /> Rather than help the Confederate plight, the Lawrence Raid proved disastrous. In retaliation the army carried out General Order Number 11 forcing people in Jackson, Butler, Bates, and Saline counties to abandon their homes, thus depriving the bushwhackers of sanctuary.<br /> The last illustration in the book seems rather shocking to Northern sensibilities. It shows a 1898 reunion of former Quantrill raiders where such luminaries as Frank James and Cole Younger were held up as romantic heroes.e Union cavalry was hot on their trail and that they came close to trapping them several times. <BR> Rather than help the Confederate plight, the Lawrence Raid proved disastrous.

He's never come close to being nominated for The National Book Award, but he has won the O'Henry Award for his short story &quot;The Man in the Black Suit,&quot; which is included in this anthology. Obviously the judges who distribute that award have never read any of King's longer works; he's only done the devil thing a couple of hundred times. But there's a far better story in this collection, &quot;All That You Love Will Be Carried Away.&quot; It's about a traveling salesman who decides to end it all in a seedy motel with a .38 caliber Smith &amp; Wesson, but before he pulls the trigger he sifts through his most prized possession, a notebook full of graffito he has collected during his travels. Some of them are on the offensive side and he doesn't want them found with his body. He has a family after all. He decides to bury the notebook in a farmer's field outside the motel. Alfie Zimmer clings to one small thread of a lifeline, however. Could he edit the notebook and perhaps interest a publisher? Before entering the motel, he had noticed lights glowing from a nearby farmhouse. Now the house is dark. He decides to count to sixty; if the lights come back on he will try to publish his book of graffito; if they don't he will go back inside and blow his brains out.<br /> Another good one is &quot;Riding the Bullet,&quot; a rather famous story in that it was published on the Internet. In his prefatory remarks King talks about how the story was inspired by the death of his mother. In it a college student is called home because his mother has had a stroke. I think you need to know a little about King's background in order to appreciate this story. His father left early on and his mother raised him. Although she made barely enough money to support herself, she sent him a small allowance every week for spending money while he was attending college at the University of Maine. &quot;The Bullet&quot; in the title is an amusement park ride. King can't help himself; he practically ruins the story by including one of his devil characters.<br /> In another one of his prefatory notes, King says he writes two short stories or so a year. I think he should do it full time and ditch the tedious devils.Bullet&quot; in the title is an amusement park ride.

Nordic mythology has been generally portrayed as moody and depressing, with evil defeating Asgard during the Twilight of the Gods. According to Padraic Column the battle was a draw with the Giants and their allies being destroyed as well.<br /> Column also begins his account with the aftermath of the battle with a new world springing from the old, a much better world.<br /> For me, the most impressive aspect of Column's book is the fallibility of the Norse gods. Odin cheats the builder of the wall around Asgard out of his payment. Loki kills an otter who turns out to be a blacksmith's son. Odin pays him a bounty by stealing a dwarf's treasure, which leads to the eventual destruction of Asgard. (One of the rings has a curse on it.)<br /> I was also rather surprised by the Loki character. I had always thought that he was more mischievous than evil, similar to Coyote in Native American mythology, but in Column's account, after the theft of the treasure, Loki deteriorates into a truly evil entity, marrying the witch Angerbora who gives birth to Fenir the Wolf, the serpent Jormungand, and a third entity called Hela, the withering of all life.<br /> But they are all destroyed and in the end we are left with Lif and her mate Lifthrasir, Adam and Eve characters, awakening in the forest where Odin had hidden them. There is a new son and a new moon and new gods, Vidar and Vali, sons of Odin, who find tablets the older gods have left, telling of all that happened before the Twilight of the Gods.	2003-10-22

That's how much I identify with Sara Nelson's SO MANY BOOKS, SO LITTLE TIME.<br /> Nelson not only loves books but she also makes her living at it, reviewing them for GLAMOUR MAGAZINE and THE NEW YORK OBSERVER.<br /> Unlike most of us, Nelson's New Year's resolution (and motivation for the book) is to read a book a week for the next year. She doesn't stick to her plan very well, but her efforts are well worthwhile because of what she discovers about herself (and us?) as a reader. For instance, place is important to her. What she reads in bed will be entirely different from what she might read at the beach or on an airplane. Nelson also proves the old saw that we look for ourselves in the books we choose. For instance, she's married to a Japanese-American set designer and that makes David Mura's TURNING JAPANESE, the memoir of a second-generation Japanese man married to a Caucasion woman, all the more enticing to her. She's also a city girl and doesn't relate to rural settings at all, which is why she couldn't get through A THOUSAND ACRES, PEACE LIKE A RIVER, or PLAINSONG.<br /> I had read a few of the books Nelson talks about, MARJORIE MORNINGSTAR (Because I liked Wouk) and SLAMMERKIN to name two, but what really struck home was her admission that she gave up on certain books occasionally, even though she'd paid twenty dollars for them, and despite the fact that she has enormous respect for someone who may have spent five years of his life sweating blood. I could relate because I almost never give up on a book, no matter how painful, but I hadn't realized this had anything to do with maturation (Nelson's justification for jettisoning some books). I immediately threw out Umberto Eco's BAUDOLINO which was driving me up the wall.<br /> The book is structured rather like Natalie Goldberg's WRITING DOWN THE BONES. Each chapter sounds like one of Nelson's columns, although some of them bleed into the next chapter. A couple of them were especially memorable such as when Nelson's sister gives her her novel to read. What would she say if she didn't like it? Would their relationships be over? She had to read it because she'd been bugging her sister for it for years. There's another episode where she reads CHARLOTTE'S WEB with her third grade son, Charley. He doesn't want to read it at first because it's about farm animals. After about three chapters he tells her he now likes it because the farm animals are a lot like people and that Charlotte reminds him of her.<br /> I was beginning to think that Nelson was a big old softy until she let loose on TUESDAYS WITH MORRIE. She hates overly hyped books and she felt Mitch Albom didn't really have much to say: Stop and smell the roses; don't sweat the small stuff; concentrate not on money or status but on love of family and community, something they teach in kindergarten. I felt the same way about ZEN AND THE ART OF MOTORCYCLE MAINTENANCE, another overly hyped book with not much to say.<br /> What I'll take away from this book is that it's okay to disagree about a book, something some of the Amazon reviewers who give negative votes to people who dis their favorite book ought to remember. I loved PLAINSONG. I almost feel personally insulted that she couldn't finish it, but maybe I liked it so much because I was raised on a farm, because I was a teacher, or because those bachelor farmers struck a cord with me.

US	52809057	R2R6XNRMTWOO1B	006051390X	808869082	Bold Sons of Erin: A Novel of Suspense (Abel Jones Mysteries)	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	Master of the Welsh dialect	A couple of things: First off, any Abel Jones mystery improves when Jimmy Malloy and Mrs. Schutzengel take center stage. Owen Parry doesn't seem to realize this since he spends the early part of BOLD SONS OF ERIN having Jones interrogate a Catholic priest and Franklin Gower, the DA of Schuylkill County. This part of the book crawls along at a snail's pace.<br />  Secondly, there is an acknowledgment section that every fan of the Abel Jones series should read. It will tell you how Parry got to be such a dead-on master of the Welsh dialect.<br />  As a mystery, BSOE is rather lackluster. President Lincoln sends Jones to his home town of Pottsville, Pennsylvania, to investigate the murder of General Stone, who was there trying to recruit an Irish brigade. One of the Irish miners had confessed but had died of cholera. Jones doesn't believe it, so he digs him up only to find the disemboweled body of a young girl. And so on and so.<br />  I thought the best part of the book was the ending. Parry is almost as good at describing battle scenes as he is at dialect. Jones is looking for the illusive young man who had supposedly died of cholera at the Battle of Fredericksburg. After the battle he and Malloy crawl out to retrieve some of the wounded. This is what Jones says about the aftermath: \\"The hardest wounded men with whom you must cope are the boys who beg you not to move them, to let them lie there and not add to their pain. Some ask you to kill them.\\"<br />  Another impressive aspect of the book is how much Abel Jones grows as the plot moves along. For a Christian man he's awfully bigoted. He's not too fond of the Irish and he certainly doesn't approve of the prostitute who's been frequenting his wife's dressmaking business. But by the end of the novel, Abel and the prostitute are business partners in a coal-mining operation and he admits that the Welsh and the Irish \\"...are all Americans now.\\"	2003-10-06

The &quot;White City&quot; is the Chicago World's Fair of 1893 and it summarizes the trials the architects went through to get the fair ready in a short amount of time. We are introduced to the driving force, architect Daniel Hudson Burnham, to Frederick Law Olmsted (designer of Central Park in New York) the landscape artist, and to George Ferris, inventer of the Ferris Wheel, the centerpiece of the World Fair and Burnham's bid to outdo the Eiffel Tower. Ohmstead is probably the most interesting of these stalwarts in that I was not aware of what a tortured genius he was. He suffered from toothaches, depression, chronic insomnia and an almost pathological perfectionism. Erik Larson throws in the assassination of Mayor Carter Harrison and a scorned Buffalo Bill Cody to add a little flavor.<br /> The &quot;devil&quot; in the title is Dr. Henry H. Holmes (real name Herman Mudgett) who built a hotel to lure unescorted young ladies during the fair and disposed of them by smothering them with chloroform or by gassing them. Because the police were so distracted by the fair, no one was really aware of what this fiend was doing, despite the many complaints lodged by relatives. It's a wonder Holmes isn't more well known. Jack the Ripper pales in comparison. Some estimates surmise that he murdered up to a hundred women and children.<br /> This segment of the book really picks up steam when Detective Frank Geyer enters the picture and begins to track three of Holmes' youthful victims. Geyer was one of those plodding, relentless types who don't get much attention in American folklore, but they always get their man.<br /> Holmes wrote a number of &quot;biographies.&quot; There's a quote from him at the beginning: &quot;I was born with the devil in me. I could not help the fact that I was a murderer, no more than a poet can help the inspiration to sing.&quot; Holmes defines the word &quot;psychopath&quot; and seemed to murder for fun more than anything else.un more than anything else.	2003-09-17

For the uninformed, Benny Binion, Ted's father, originated the World Series of Poker; Ted Binion, his son, was murdered by his paramour, Sandy Murphy, and her lover Rick Tabish for the millions in silver he kept buried in the desert. McManus decides to use his advance to enter a satellite tournament, and when he wins he enters the WSP.<br /> In No Limit Texas Hold'em, the main event at the WSP worth over a million dollars to the winner, each player is dealt two cards face down; the players then bet, quite often trying to drive the other players out by going \\"all in\\" or betting all of their chips. If someone calls, the players are dealt three common cards (called the flop); betting ensues and if players remain, they get another common card called the \\"turn\\" or fourth street; they bet again and if two players are still in the pot, another card the \\"river\\" or fifth street (hence the title) is dealt. They bet again and best hand wins.<br /> McManus will remind you a lot of one of his heroes, Hunter Thompson, gonzo journalist who wrote FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS. McManus has the same rambling style and also takes a lot of drugs, although most of his are prescription. Other than poker and the murder trial, McManus alludes to his wife and two little girls, two older children from a previous marriage, his morning swims, his purchase of an expensive diamond ring for his wife (she never got one when they got married) as well as literary allusions by the ton (He's also a writing teacher at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago). He loves Dante so much he named one of his daughters Beatrice. McManus also has an annoying habit of whining about just about everything. Fifth place isn't good enough for him; he's got second place prize money, over $800,000, spent before he's eliminated. Apparently, during one of the rewrites, McManus realized he was complaining too much because he starts making fun of himself.<br /> McManus refers to himself as \\"Good Jim\\", the Jim who keeps pictures of his family at the poker table for good luck and \\"Bad Jim\\", the Jim who buys lap dances with his winnings, then agonizes over telling his wife about it. Eventually we realize that McManus includes all of this personal information because he's comparing his own situation with that of Murphy, Tabish, and the Binions and what a fine line there is between them.re he's eliminated.

THE SNOWMAN'S CHILDREN is more concerned with the impact of the murders on children growing up in Detroit during the time the Oakland County Child Killer prowled the streets in search of his pre-teen victims than with lowbrow titillation. Glen Hirshberg, who grew up in Detroit during the time of the murders, loosely based this novel on Tommy McIntyre's WOLF IN SHEEP'S CLOTHING: THE SEARCH FOR A CHILD KILLER.<br /> In this fictional account, the main character Mattie Rhodes returns to Detroit, seventeen years after the murders, in search of his boyhood friend, Theresa Daughrety. During the year the Snowman was on the prowl, Mattie, his friend Spencer Franklin and Theresa went through various traumas, some related some unrelated to the murders. The three are gifted students who compete in Mind Wars, a kind of up tempo Trivial Pursuit, to see who is the sharpest. Theresa usually puts the other two to shame. The game is run by Theresa's father, Dr. Daughrety, who is unduly taken with his daughter's intelligence. On their own, the three play \\"Murder in the Dark\\", where one player stalks the other two in a pitch-black basement. The Snowman's depravities are a backdrop to the everyday travails of eleven-year-olds until Theresa, who is showing increasing signs of mental distress, becomes directly involved.<br /> Theresa is the most interesting character of the three; apparently, while the other children have been shaking in their boots, she's been on the trail of the Snowman, despite her emotional shakiness. Mattie worships her, probably because of her seeming indifference to the popularity game most kids worry about.<br /> For comic relief, Glen Hirshberg adds some quirky elements, such as Sergeant Ross's addiction to licorice sticks; Mattie's little brother's apparent hatred for Mattie; Mark \\"the Bird\\" Fidrych's pitching exploits, and Mattie's Blue Grass singing wife.<br /> I found it a bit hard to get into the book at first because Hirschberg doesn't tell us a whole lot until well past midpoint and because Hirschberg jumps back and forth from 1994 to 1976. Mattie's reactions to just about everything are also overly emotive. His heart jumps into his throat when his cereal is cold. Hirschberg also loves similes, unfortunately only two out of three hit their mark.<br /> Despite these minor foibles, I highly recommend the book. Hirshberg has talent to burn as is evidenced by the following description of Mattie's teacher who'd been in a traffic accident: \\"She looked frail, like a china plate someone had broken and glued back together, minus one or two tiny but unnoticeable chips.\\"get into the book at first because Hirschberg doesn't tell us a whole lot until well past midpoint and because Hirschberg jumps back and forth from 1994 to 1976.

There's lots of baseball talk in TEAMMATES (Halberstam explains why the 1946 team that beat the Yankees by seventeen games never became the dynasty it seemed primed to be), but the main emphasis is on how these primarily blue-collar men provided emotional and professional support throughout the years.<br /> The structure of the book revolves around a trip Pesky and DiMaggio made to Florida to see Ted just before he died (Doerr had to be with his wife, Monica, who had suffered two strokes). They spend two days with him during which time they talk baseball and DiMaggio sings to Ted &quot;I Love Her but I Don't Know How to Tell Her&quot; and &quot;Me and My Shadow.&quot; DiMaggio asks Ted if he's getting the baseball scores, and when Ted tells him, &quot;Nobody tells me anything,&quot; DiMaggio calls him every morning for the rest of Ted's life.<br /> Although Halberstam provides a detailed account of Doerr's, Pesky's, and DiMaggio's family and professional life before and after baseball, he glosses over Williams's three failed marriages. He does try to explain Ted's seeming emotional instability by delving into his upbringing. Ted's father was an alcoholic and his mother was a religious zealot who cared more about the Salvation Army than her two sons. If not for baseball, Ted could have turned out like his brother, Danny, who was in and out of trouble with the law.<br /> This is a sad book. Williams was a lonely man when he died and this was compounded by his son's efforts to profit on his father's fame, but there is some solace in his former teammates' loyalty.	2003-08-30

The novel is about expatriates living and working in 1990s Budapest, just after the fall of Communism. The protagonist, journalist John Price, is in Budapest to reconcile with his brother Scott, who for some reason cannot stand the sight of him. John is enamored of embassy aide Emily Oliver, who is likewise disenchanted (She could be the Lady Brett of the piece if we continue the SUN ALSO RISES analogy). Charles Gabor, an American venture capitalist, is the villain (unless you count John Price as his own worst enemy) as he's in Budapest to make a name for himself by pillaging newly democratic Hungary of its marketable assets. All of these characters hang out at Caf&eacute; Gerbeaud where they play a game called \\"Sincerity,\\" especially appropriate since practically no one is this novel is sincere.<br /> We catch another whiff of SUN ALSO RISES when we learn that John Price is a virgin. A co-worker at his newspaper quickly divests him of the burden and before we know it Price is involved in a quirky sexual relationship with Nicky (no last name that I can remember), a photographer/artist and the most interesting character in the book.<br /> The plot revolves around Charles Gabor's efforts to loot Imri Horvath's publishing business with the help of some promotional articles written by John Price. Then there's the three-way relationship between Nicky, Emily, and John, the climax of which is the most entertaining part of the book.<br /> The characters don't measure up to SUN ALSO RISES, although John Price has to be one of the most clueless protagonists I've ever encountered. The depressing tone is similar, however; we get the feeling that Phillips isn't so sure Budapest is better off under capitalism. I was also bothered by Phillips penchant for long sentences with intrusive parenthetical remarks, a stylistic irritant that I know Hemingway would choke on. I was also wondering why in the heck the book was called PRAGUE when the novel is set in Budapest. We don't get to see Prague until Price's train reaches the outskirts of the city at the end of the book. Maybe the choice was similar to the movie FARGO, where BRAINERD just didn't sound right.called PRAGUE when the novel is set in Budapest.

In her author's note she compares it to the war in Bosnia. In order to dramatize this notion, McCrumb uses modern-day reenactors who attract the ghosts of the Civil War soldiers who died in the mountains but were unable to pass into the next world.<br /> I ordered this book a couple of months before it was published so obviously I enjoy McCrumb's work, but I had trouble getting into this one, mainly because of the multiple viewpoints and the shifting back and forth from modern Appalachia to the 1860s. Also, as she did with Frankie Silver, McCrumb tries to fictionalize historical personages, namely Malinda &quot;Sam&quot; Blalock and Governor Zebulon Baird Vance (Tom Dooley even makes a cameo appearance). Blalock fought alongside her husband in the Civil War and Baird was governor of North Carolina. When she flashes back in time, Baird is the protagonist as is Blalock. In modern day Appalachia we have Sheriff Arrowood and Nora Bonesteel, as well as Rattler.<br /> Because of these shifting viewpoints the novel never does gather any momentum. In McCrumb's earlier work, Spensor Arrowood was the center who made McCrumb's psychic elements believable. In this one he's almost a superfluous character, as is Nora Bonesteel.	2003-08-13

This book is 764 pages long and it took me three weeks to read. Yet, I can't say it was a wasted effort.<br /> Henry Ford is the undisputed star. Brinkley spends pages trying to decide whether old Henry was a genius or just a excellent judge of character. He finally arrives at a compromise of sorts: Ford would not have succeeded without James Couzens, his business manager; Charles Sorenson, production manager, or C. Harold Wills, his chief designer. But it was Henry Ford's vision and will power that held everything together. He was also a genius at promotion (sometimes self promotion).<br /> Brinkley does not shirk in his criticism of Ford's warts. Much of the book is devoted to Ford's anti-Semitism. On the other hand, he's quick to tell us of Ford's devotion to African American workers and his financing of Ford Hospital and social programs for his immigrant workers.<br /> Although he's ambivalent about Henry Ford, Brinkley loves Edsel and Henry II. Brinkley's Edsel is an urbane and sophisticated man whom the author gives credit for the development of the Lincoln Continental and other styling at Ford. He also debunks the notion that Henry Ford contributed to Edsel's early death. Henry II is shown as an empathetic man who worked hand-in-hand with Walter Reuther's UAW to improve employee/employer relations.<br /> Up until reading this book, I couldn't tell a Ford Taurus from a Ford Tempo, but I have to say that lately I've been paying more attention and, yes, the Tempo does look rather like a jellybean.	2003-08-04

If you're expecting a story about a man trying to teach his dog how to talk, you've got another think coming. This is about a man grieving over his wife's death. Lexy Ransome had either jumped or fallen from the top of an apple tree and the only witness is her dog Lorelei. Paul Iverson, a professor of linguistics, sets out to teach her how to talk so she can tell him what really happened.<br /> The two lead characters are extremely well drawn. Lexy is an artist who makes decorative masks for every occasion, including death masks. At one point in her life she shaved her head, had the dome tattoed with snakes and went to The Prom as the only bald-headed girl there. The Paul Iverson portrayal is impressive because of how well Parkhurst gets inside the head of a man (He is the narrator). His relationship with his first wife is especially true to life.<br /> If you're thinking this is too much of a downer for you, don't let it bother you. Just when things get especially bleak, Parkhurst throws in a little comic relief. We see Iverson trying to teach Lorelei how to say &quot;water&quot; by hiding her water bowl. She's to smart for him; she drinks out of the toilet bowl.<br /> Some parts of the novel are a bit far-fetched. During his research, Iverson finds a man who operated on dogs to make them more receptive to human speech. The man is doing prison time, but he's got a bunch of followers carrying on in his name. Iverson is so desperate to find out what happened to Lexy that he attends one of their meetings. Because Iverson is such a likable character we accept this. The book also works as a mystery, as Lexy leaves sprinkles of evidence lying about that Paul tries to decipher: she had cooked a steak just before she died, but there's no evidence she ate it; she had rearranged Paul's bookshelves; she had made a phone call to a psychic. All of this draws us further and further into the book, good to the very last bit.	2003-07-13

It's hard to know who's really important.<br /> The lead character, Ross Wakeman, is a kind of ghost buster with suicidal tendencies. He wants to join his fianc&eacute;e, Aimie, who had been killed in a car accident that he feels guilty about. He's already tried to kill himself a couple of times.<br /> Newton Redhook, a development company, hires Wakeman to prove there are no ghosts on property it has acquired from an old man named Spencer Pike. Stephen Kingisms abound. Rose petals fall from the sky, the ground freezes in the middle of August, the town drunk wakes one morning with his straight hair turned curly,<br />and while Ross is videotaping the place, he meets a woman who seems as mortal as he is, until she walks through a gravestone. But it's too late; he's already fallen in love with another dead woman.<br /> Gradually, very gradually, Picoult begins to connect the people she introduced at the beginning of the book and that's when it gets good. You see, Spencer Pike, owner of the haunted land, had a wife who was apparenty murdered along with her baby daughter and she's the woman Ross has fallen for.<br /> Picoult very adroitly uses historical background to make SECOND GLANCE more than just a ghost story. You see, back when he was a young man, Spencer Pike was one of the prime movers of the Eugenics movement, a \\"voluntary\\" sterilization project which the Nazis used as a model for their own program. Pike and his fellow scientists believed criminal behavior was inherited and could be eliminated by preventing these people from passing on their genes.<br /> Throw in a 102-year-old Abenaki Indian with multiple identifies and you've got an enthralling summer read.	2003-07-10

When that happens to me, I turn to Ed McBain or Stuart Kaminsky or Dick Francis, who never let me down. Jeffrey Deaver is rapidly becoming one of my old reliables.<br /> Another similarity between Deaver and Francis is that there's an element other than the mystery. Francis's lead characters are steeplechase jockeys and movie directors and glass blowers; we always learn something new. In his Lincoln Rhyme mystery, the STONE MONKEY, Deaver took us into the world of Chinese people smuggling. In this one we learn about magicians.<br /> A quick change artist murders a young girl at a performing arts school. Rhyme and Amelia Sachs peg the murderer \\"the Conjurer\\" who seems to be imitating Houdini and other great illusionists of the past. When Amelia visits a magic store, she is introduced to a young woman who goes by the name Kara, who will help school Amelia and Rhyme in the nuances of prestidigitation.<br /> The Conjurer's next trick is to saw a man in half and that one is followed by the \\"Water Torture Chamber,\\" which is interrupted in the nick of time, leading to an elaborate chase scene during which the Conjurer pulls off another quick change and gets away.<br /> Deaver seems to revel as much in \\"misdirection\\" as the magicians he's writing about. Early on we learn who the Conjurer is, but we should have known better because nothing is as it seems in this roller coaster of a thriller.	2003-06-30

She looks like a baby Bette Davis with a stringy bob and she talks with her hands. Someone asked her who her favorite comedian was and she said, \\"Don Rickles. He'd kill you people in the front row in the sweaters. He'd just kill you.\\"<br />When the session was over, I wanted more so I bought THE PARTLY-CLOUDY PATRIOT.<br /> The book reads more like a journal than a collection of essays. Perhaps the best one is about Al Gore. Sarah Vowell sees herself as a nerd and although she's a staunch democrat she most readily identifies with other nerds. Al Gore wrote a book on the environment, among other nerdish things, so he qualifies. This essay resonated with me because I've often wondered why we don't have more stringent requirements for the job of president.<br /> Another sample of her caustic wit was her essay on Teddy Roosevelt, who was part nerd and part adventurer. Her father used to tell her about Teddy's problems with asthma. He could do nothing except stay in bed and read. \\"Ew,\\" said her sister. \\"Sigh,\\" said Sarah. Staying in bed all day was a lifelong ambition for her.<br /> I have to admit that I was expecting THE PARTLY-CLOUDY PATRIOT to be a real slam session, but that's not the case. Sarah attends George W. Bush's inauguration, bending over backwards to be fair. Although she cries when W. takes the oath, she chastises a friend who boos Staff Sergeant Alec T.

The back story involving Richard More's parents reads like a gothic novel. Theirs was an arranged marriage that quickly unraveled with Samuel, Richard's father, living in London, and his mother, Katherine, carrying on an affair with another man, resulting in four bastard children. Richard More's father is such a snake it's hard to believe people like him actually exist. When his wife is too blatant in her affair, he divorces her and has their illegitimate children deported to America on the Mayflower. Richard is assigned to William Brewster the temporary minister at Plymouth Colony. Richard is pretty much treated like a servant and the Stranger (non Puritan) that he is and his brothers and sisters die.<br /> Apparently Samuel's arrangement with Brewster was rather like that of an indentured servant. After seven years, Brewster's obligation was fulfilled. Richard then hooks up with Richard Hollingsworth, a shipwright whose daughter Christian he marries. They ultimately have seven children together. Richard becomes a sea captain and in the process takes another wife in England, an offense which could have gotten him hanged since the penalty for bigamy was death.<br /> Richard More lived to be an old man and was known among the Puritans as one of the Ancient Ones. He was around at the beginning of the colony and was there for the Salem Witch trials. He was not hanged for being a witch but he did become embroiled in politic intrigue and was found guilty of adultery and required to wear a scarlet A, just like Hester Prynne.<br /> Author David Lindsay, a descendant of Richard More, did extensive research on his subject, but the book is replete with supposition which cheapens his effort. Lindsay set out to prove Richard a rogue, but in the end he finds enough to like about him to determine that he was human just like the rest of us.<br /> Lindsay has an annoying style of writing, addressing another character in the book. I got the impression this was supposed to be the person who accused Richard of adultery but I'm not really sure. I wasn't interested enough to read over the beginning to find out. History lovers will like the book. The fact that there was such a character as Richard More among the sanctimonious Pilgrims is enough of a hook.this was supposed to be the person who accused Richard of adultery but I'm not really sure.

Every year during the pre-race parade at the Triple Crown and Breeders Cup I trace the sires and dams of the different racers. Quite a few are given space in this book.<br /> In STUD: ADVENTURES IN BREEDING, Conley introduces us to Storm Cat, the highest paid stallion in America, and to Seattle Slew, who was still alive at the time the book was written. There's some interesting stuff about how spinal fusion saved Slew's life and how he returns to stand at stud almost as good as new.<br /> The structure of the book is a bit hard to follow. We visit some of the great sires, and their breeding sheds where we are party to some of the inside secrets, such as the &#34;teaser&#34; stallion, a generally docile sort who gets the mares ready to be bred. We also go to Keenland for an auction where we meet the Arab sheiks and Irish high rollers who seem to dominate these sales. Later on, we're introduced to pacers and trotters where we find a difference approach. The pacers and trotters embrace artifical insemination, whereas that's a no no with the Thoroughbreds.<br /> The most interesting part of the book for me was the historical background starting in 1704 when Darley Arabian was smuggled out of Turkey by Thomas Darley. Conley traces Storm Cat's ancestry all the way back to Darley Arabian, Northern Dancer (the greatest of all sires) and Nijinsky, the Dancer's son.<br /> Conley also gives us a look at breeding hierarchy. The best stallions and dams breed in Kentucky. Others are shipped off to places like California and New Mexico, which doesn't mean these places don't sometimes produce a winner. We're introduced to California bred Tiznow, who won the Breeder's Cup Classic two years in a row, something no other horse has done.<br /> It's amazing how much these horses are like human beings. Some are aggressive, some are moody, some are aloof. Conley brings this home with a visit to the New Bolton Center where Shetland ponies live on a preserve with almost no human intervention. Each stallion has his own little harem, but there's a definite hierarchy with a definite Alpha stallion. A funny part was when they were observed comparing fecal piles.<br /> Although Conley has a fondness for the parenthetical remark, I enjoyed this book immensely and shall be looking forward to his next, hopefully in the not-too-distant future. A good writer is able to fashion an entirely unique world and Conley certainly does that here.tion.

SCREWBALL is based on an intriguing situation: The general manager of the Boston Red Sox, suffering from the Curse of the Babe, is confronted by a video showing Ron Kane, his superstar pitcher (who may be the greatest who ever lived) disposing of a decapitated body.<br /> From there the focus moves to the general manager, Neville Wulfmeyer, and the niece of the owner of the BoSox who are being blackmailed by the sender of the video.<br /> This is where the book begins to go haywire. Wulfmeyer has no scruples. At one point he suggests they kill someone else to throw the police off the trail. In another instance, he kidnaps the manager's wife to avoid paying a bonus.<br /> Certainly hyperbole is a tried and true method in satire, but Ferrell has about as much subtlety as a gangsta rapper. Kane throws the baseball 111 mph on a consistent basis. Every single member of the Red Sox is a ding-a-ling. One of them tosses a teargas cannister into a carload full of nuns. Another holds up a liquor store. About the only stabilizing influence is the manager, Augie \\"Big Fish\\" Sharkey. He's developing a king-sized ulcer, guzzling Pepto Bismol like water, but he tries to do the right thing, investigating the murders on his own. Ferrell does him an injustice in the end with a completely unrealistic resolution, the implication of which would destroy Major League Baseball if it were true.<br /> Something else that bothered me throughout the book was an Honus Wagner snuff can Sharkey carries as a good luck piece (until it's stolen). One of the reasons Wagner's baseball cards are worth over a half million a piece is because he objected to his image being used to sell tobacco to children, a hypocritical stand to take if he actually chewed the stuff (which I doubt).	2003-06-07

By the time I got to the last page of Samuel Hynes's memoir GROWING SEASONS, I had developed such an attachment to young Sam that I was reluctant to quit reading. Luckily Hynes had written an earlier memoir about his days as a dive bomber pilot during WWII entitled FLIGHTS OF PASSAGE. Imagine my surprise when I spotted the book already in my bookcase. I'd read it when it was published in 1988. I had to read it again.<br /> Hynes writes with such humility it's easy to put yourself in his shoes. Sam is continually worried about being cut from the flight program and sent to Great Lakes to train as an enlisted man. He also doesn't shirk from describing the times he crashed his plane or did something stupid, trying to show off. Although he went on over a hundred missions on Okinawa, he isn't sure his contribution to the war effort was worth that much. He's disappointed when he's left behind when his squadron goes on a bombing run of Japan.<br /> As an ex-Navy man myself I can relate to a lot of what Hynes went through: the depressing bus stations, the sexual braggadocio, the feeling of vertigo when changing duty stations, the hurry-up-and-wait mentality, the obsession with drinking and playing cards.<br /> About the only problem I have with the book is that the other pilots don't really come alive for me--I had trouble remembering who they were. Sam also gets married (at nineteen) before going overseas, but we never get to know his wife. He doesn't say much about her letters; he doesn't even seem to miss her. I had an ominous feeling about that marriage.<br />  Perhaps the most memorable part of the book is when the war ends and Hynes and his fellow pilots are sitting around waiting for orders and they're caught in a typhoon! It blows away several tents and several men are killed. Talk about situational irony.	2003-06-01

He names names, the NEW YORK TIMES, NEWSWEEK, AND TIME MAGAZINE garnering their share of criticism. Chase claims Kaczynski was no worse than any other math whiz until he got to Harvard, where he volunteered for Henry A. Murray's \\"Multiform Assessments of Personality Development\\" experiment with twenty-one other elite students. The subjects were told to write an essay expounding on their philosophy of life which would be debated by an aggressive young lawyer. According to Chase, Kaczynski was humiliated by this experience, having nightmares about psychologists chasing him. Eventually Kaczynski would target psychologists versed in behavior modification.<br /> Chase doesn't spend much time on biography, but he does show Kaczynski growing up in Evergreen Park, Illinois, the first child of intellectual parents, whom he later blames for pushing him too hard. After skipping two grades in school, he arrives at Harvard totally lacking in social skills. Apparently he never grew up. We see him later on writing obscene lyrics on the walls at Foam Cutting Engineers after a woman he had fallen in love with spurns him.<br /> Alston Chase indicts the curriculum at Harvard during the time Kaczynski spent there as co-conspirators, especially something called positivism, the theory that only empirically verifiable statements are meaningful, that moral and spiritual judgments, not being verifiable, are mere \\"cognitively meaningless expressions of emotion.\\" Kaczynski would use this as a philosophical underpinning for what he did.<br /> Chase's argues that Ted Kaczynski is far from alone in his hatred toward technology. Most all terrorists hate modern technological civilization, many of them living right here in the United States. Just one example the December 1999 \\"Battle of Seattle\\" at the World Trade Organization meeting, where ecosaboteurs ran amok.<br /> This sort of happening may be closer to home than you might think. I have to admit that I wasn't aware of the Earth Liberation Front's 2002 attack on the University of Minnesota's future genetic research center that caused $630,000 in damages.<br /> Chase's conclusion sums things up quite effectively.

One of Enziro's henchman is murdered and Rowdy and Kimi are instrumental in finding the culprit.<br /> If you've read Evanovich, you know her bounty hunter has quite a unique sense of humor. She constantly has problems with her car, as does Holly. There's a hole in the floor of Holly's Bronco and she's worried something will happen to her dogs. She need not have worried because somebody ultimately blows it up. Conant uses dog hair and puppy shenanigans to add humor as well.<br /> Much of the book concerns one of Holly's other sidelines, showing her champion Malamutes. At one of these shows, the mafiosos show up and try to bribe the judge. There's a short tutorial about the various competitions here that left me more confused than before. There's Best of Breed, Best of Opposites, and Best of Winners. Conant tries to explain the differences but I'm still in the dark. Conant also has trouble juggling the dog material with the Enziro Guarini plot.<br /> I had a problem with the stereotypical Italian hoodlums. They have names like Favuzza and Zappardino, and Al Favuzza looks like Count Dracula. Conant also has a fascination with beginning participial phrases; there are at least five on each page.	2003-05-19

It hasn't been that long since THE WAILING WIND.<br /> This one is a very rapid read, with much of the action happening away from the Navajo reservation (Always a bad move, Tony). The plot centers around the murder of a retired CIA operative who's investigating the theft of billions of dollars in Indian oil, gas, coal, and timber royalties for a United States senator.<br /> Bernie Manuelito has taken a job with the border patrol to get away from Jim Chee, her pushy boss, when she stumbles across a suspicious construction project in the middle of the desert. Unknowingly, she has become embroiled in a smuggling operation and her picture is being spread around by Mexican drug traffickers as a DEA agent to be on the lookout for. Meanwhile, Chee is pining away for Bernie, trying to think of a reason to go get her and ask her to marry him. This is where Joe Leaphorn enters the picture. He gets out his maps and is able to tie the original murder scene to some abandoned oil and gas pipelines leading from Sonora, Mexico, to the site of the murder. The Sinister Pig of the title is a device used to clean the insides of the pipelines. Joe quickly grasps the possibilities.<br /> Hillerman uses multiple viewpoints to help us follow the action. There's a billionaire drug smuggler, his former CIA pilot (the most interesting character in the book), and a corrupt border patrol supervisor and of course our friends Joe, Jim, and Bernie.<br /> I'd be surprised if this book is over 70,000 words it reads so fast. I liked a couple of things about it, besides Chee and Leaphorn of course, two of the best characters in the mystery genre: the factual basis of the book, the royalty money which the Department of the Interior lost or stole and the great character, Budge C. de Baca, the billionaire's pilot, a romantic felon I haven't seen anywhere else. I also like Cowboy Dashee, a recurring character in the Leaphorn/Chee series, who is now working for the Bureau of Land Management.

If you're a cynical sort, you might have problems with suspension of disbelief; if not, this work might be a pleasant change from more pedestrian best sellers.<br /> O'Neill's flair for description is excellent. He puts us in 1886 Edinburgh, where lamplighters sally forth each night to shed light on the sooty recesses of Old Town. But there's murder afoot. Some fiend has been butchering some of the city's elite and digging them up if they're already dead. The first such victim is a professor of ecclesiastical law, who had been at odds with one of the heroes of the novel, Thomas McKnight, \\"a disillusioned professor of logic and metaphysics\\" who becomes a suspect. When he's fired from his professorship, McKnight becomes obsessed by a young orphan girl named Evelyn who seems to be implicated in the murders. In short order, a light house operator and a con man are also torn to shreds; everything seems to point to Evelyn, but she's a mere strip of a girl and couldn't possibly have done any of the murders without help.<br /> I'm a sucker for good characterization and there's some of that happening here. Carus Groves is the \\"official\\" investigator charged with solving these crimes. He, too, focuses on Evelyn (One of the problems I had with the book is that Groves and McKnight cover some of the same ground and the book bogs down in the middle because of it). O'Neill can't seem to make up his mind about Carus. This is Carus's first big case and he's part Inspector Clouseau and part Sherlock Holmes. The best scene in the book is when Carus discovers Evelyn's body after spending a day at the library reading everything he can find on the occult.<br /> The book loses credibility when the devil enters the picture and we find out two of the characters are really figments of Evelyn's powerful imagination.	2003-05-11

He loses that job, too, only to open a City Service gas station, always seeming to bounce back. The man is a rock.<br /> What's memorable about the man is his values. When his first wife dies, he remarries, not so much for love, but to find a mother for his two sons. At Thanksgiving, he asks for the neck from the turkey, claiming he prefers it to a leg or a breast. When his son dents the running board on his new car, he's grateful his boy is all right. He seems to understand that boys have to try things out, to take a risk here and there, even if it's buying a phony driver's license and carousing with his pals at roadside beer joints. There's a scene where Sam's father is on his death bed where finally he asks for a little understanding. Just before he dies, he says, \\"I gave up a lot.\\"<br /> Sam is also an endearing character. His first sexual experience is as clumsy as most everybody's is. He's not even sure he got the job done. The book ends with Sam leaving for Navy flight school a couple of years into WWII. By that time you've made friends with Sam and you won't want the book to end. But take heart, Hynes has written several other memoirs about his war experence: FLIGHTS OF PASSAGE being the most memorable.	2003-05-05

He's even got a family, two adopted kids he's rescued from abuse (Feather, a mulatto six-year-old and Jesus, a seventeen-year-old) and a live-in lover, but because of his street reputation people from the black community still come to Easy for help. Easy is not in it for the money; he truly cares about his people.<br /> The \\"six pieces\\" in the title are short stories revolving around the same setting. It's 1964 Los Angeles and Easy must take on cases the police disdain because they occur in a dangerous part of town. The first story \\"Smoke\\" deals with a smoke-bombing of Sojourner Truth, which Easy eventually traces to a gambling debt.<br /> Throughout the first several stories, Easy is haunted by his friend Mouse's murder. Easy feels responsible since Mouse was helping him on one of his cases. Easy has a feeling the notorious Mouse is still alive. Easy is also upset about his live-in lover Bonnie, a stewardess who may have had an affair with a black politician she met during a tour of Africa. Easy feels inferior to the man.<br /> Outside of Easy, Mosley doesn't have much of a flair for character development. Jesus works on his sailing boat; that's about it. Bonnie tries to convince Easy she still loves him. The plot lines of the various stories are rather pedestrian. \\"Amber Gate\\" is about the murder of a young prostitute; Easy takes the case as a favor for his shoemaker who promises him a new pair of shoes (worth $200) if he'll help prove a friend of his is innocent. Easy traces the crime to a hobo who hated black prostitutes who mess with white men. \\"Amber Gate\\" is unique in that there is no closure to the story.<br /> I chose this book because of the structure. I didn't really like the first Mosley book I read, but with short stories what's the harm? The same thing happened to me once with Ed McBain.

I chose to read VAPOR TRAIL because of the Stillwater, Minnesota, setting. Stillwater is one of the oldest and most charming cities in Minnesota. It's also home to the state prison, where Cole Younger and his brothers spent twenty-five years for the Northfield bank robbery.<br /> The setting might as well have been Winona or Mankato for all the use Logan makes of this potentially fascinating site. VAPOR TRAIL is pretty much a conventional thriller, with the emphasis on pace at the expense of characterization. I refer to Dirty Harry because the plot sounds suspiciously like one of the latter movies where a rogue cop decides to take the law into his own hands.<br /> Logan is also rather amateurish in spots. For instance, he uses the mirror cliche to describe his main character. I was surprised to see this used as a sample in the review I read in the Minneapolis Star Tribune. To compound the felony, Logan compares his characters to celebrities. One of the protagonist's many former girlfriends is referred to as a Mitzi Gaynor type. But probably the most outrageous stunt was to have Lucas Davenport make a cameo appearance at the scene of one of the murders. For those who aren't John Sandford fans, Lucas is the lead character in the Prey novels. (Sandford provides a blurb on the dust jacket.)<br /> Despite all of these transgressions, I was rather impressed with the ending. Logan keeps us guessing throughout as to who the woman is who's been killing off sexual predators. We think it's the prosecuting attorney, but Logan pulls off a rather nifty switcheroo at the end. I hadn't even thought of who it turned out to be.	2003-04-21

For instance, as a child, Gould played stickball in the streets of New York City. This crops up over an over again. He also uses stickball as an explanation as to why so many intellectuals (Bart Giamati, George Will, David Halberstam to name a few) are/were so addicted to baseball. He disavows the notion that baseball imitates life or vice versa. His explanation is that many of these men played baseball as kids and are partial to the game.<br /><br />  Gould examines such issues as why there are no longer any .400 hitters. Gould's explanation is that the standard deviation between the best players and the poorest has lessened since the .400 hitters were in evidence. Later on he discusses sports biographies, using such professiorial words as \\"hagiographical\\" and \\"quotidian\\" to describe the two kinds. The first concentrates on the player's exploits on the field; whereas, the other would emphasize social commentary and the player's personal life. The quotidian sort of bio took center stage with Jim Boutin's BALL FOUR and has been imitated ever since.<br />  Although he's spent most of his life in Boston, Gould has also been a Yankee fan since he was a kid, and as such, his favorite player has always been Joe Dimaggio. Gould considers Joltin' Joe's fifty-six game hitting streak the greatest achievement in the history of baseball, despite the fact that Joe did it twice actually, once as a player in the Pacific Coast league. Gould also doesn't mention Robin Ventura's similar accomplishment as a college player, nor does he consider the fact that, unlike Barry Bonds in 2002, the pitchers may have been directed to pitch to Joe. Dimaggio walked only seventy-six times that year.<br /><br />  Gould's writing comes alive when lets the players do the talking. I enjoyed Gould's article on Dummy Hoy, the deaf mute who played in the majors from 1888-1902. Hoy played center field, a commanding position on the field, and was one of the best fielders in the league. I also liked Gould's description of Casey Stengel's decimation of a TV reporter after losing the '57 World Series. Casey used the \\"f\\" word and scratched his behind, thereby destroying the reporter's audio and video. In another review, Gould shows Leo Durocher telling his racist players to \\"wipe their a---s\\" with their petition against Jackie Robinson.Gould's writing comes alive when lets the players do the talking.

Sixteen-year-old Scott O'Toole's plane crashes in the Utah mountains in the middle of a snow storm. The pilot is dead and the plane has no radio or transponder. He must decide whether to stay put or try to walk to what looks like a cabin on a map he finds in the cabin of the plane.<br /> For a thriller, the book manages to maintain believability for the most part; but I was bothered by the scene where Scott was confronted by wolves. Wolves DO NOT attack human beings unless you invade their space.<br /> Also unusual for a thriller is Gilstrap's facility with character development. Scott O'Toole starts out as a Heavy Metal-loving teenager with little else on his mind than skiing and rock concerts; by the end of the book he has become a man.<br /> Scott's mother Sherry Carrigan O'Toole is a self-absorbed Dr. Laura Schlesinger-type, divorced from Scott's father. She has been trying to win Scott's affection by treating him to a ski trip at SkyTop resort. Scott and his father, Brandon, a rocket scientist, are referred to as Team Bachelor throughout the book, and she's jealous. When he learns his son is missing, Brandon flies to SkyTop to monitor the search.<br /> Gilstrap uses multiple perspectives: Scott; Sherry; Brandon; Barry Whitestone, the police chief in charge of the search; and Isaac DeHaven, the villain of the piece whom Scott mistakenly embraces as his salvation. I kept reading ahead to see where Scott came back into the story. Despite his blue hair, Scott is a great character. Gilstrap puts you there with him in the freezing cold with no food as he tramps through the snow toward a tiny speck on a map.	2003-04-07

Lee ride into town in the rain. This is pretty much the last time we get to see him. Lankford edits the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography and lives in Richmond so we can understand why he might be interested in the politics of running the city after the evacuation of the Confederate government, but a reader of popular history might be disappointed in his emphasis on minor characters, such as Major General Godfrey Weitzel, who administered the city for a time after Davis and his government left. Even the pictures leave something to be desired. There's one of Robert E. Lee standing on the porch of his rented home taken by Matthew Brady. Supposedly there's another one where Lee is shown with his nephew Fitzhugh I would've liked to've seen. No such luck.<br /> I was momentarily absorbed when Lankford showed Jefferson Davis leaving the city on a train carrying what was left of the Confederate treasury. It would have been interesting to see how Davis was captured, but Lankford has narrowed his focus to Richmond, so that wasn't possible. Even the fire isn't much to speak of. Davis orders what's left of the Confederate pickets to set fire to the tobacco warehouses and the wind spreads the fire; the Union Army puts it out in two days.<br /> The most intriguing part of the book is when Lincoln shows up. Lee's army has not been defeated and here he is without an escort. Lincoln further complicates matters by allowing former Supreme Court justice, John Archibald Campbell to summon the Virginia legislature to discuss seceding from the Confederacy. We get a glimpse of Edwin Stanton, Lincoln's powerful secretary of war, who puts the fritz to that notion in a hurry.<br />  Lankford also seems to have reinvented the wheel. In his acknowledgments, he mentions Rembert Patrick's THE FALL OF RICHMOND, written only forty years ago. Although Lankford has done extensive research, there doesn't seem to a reason for another version.	2003-03-31

At the beginning of the book, honey bees invade Lily Owens's bedroom. But when she tries to tell her father about them they disappear. Are they imaginary bees? Does this bode instability? No, because Lily traps some in a jar. Apparently the bees are supposed to be some sort of motif providing object lessons. The factoids we learn about bees from the epigraphs at the beginning of each chapter and elsewhere are quite interesting; for instance, on very hot days the bees fan each other with their wings within the hive.<br />  Outside of the bees, I thought the most interesting character in the book was Rosaleen, Lily's black nanny. With black nannies there's always a danger of the Calpurnia syndrome, with the character sounding too much like the maid in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. There's no danger of that here, as Rosaleen is part wise woman, part child. She also chews snuff, and when some rednecks hassle her on the way to register for the vote, she expectorates on their shoes. Lily has to break her out of jail and the two run for their lives, winding up living with the Boatwright sisters, August, June, and May, who run a bee farm. This is 1964 South Carolina, right around the time the Civil Rights Act was passed, and since the sisters are black, Lily and Rosaleen encounter more bias and friction with the white element.<br />  The plot, such as it is, revolves around Lily's search for her mother, who was killed during an argument with her father when Lily was only four. Her father lays the blame on Lily. Although she has plenty of reason to mope, Lily is a whiny character who spends page upon page upon page brooding over what a rotten portion fate has given her.<br />  All and all there's too much Lily and not enough of the bees and Rosaleen.	2003-03-18

You can see it in his Matthew Scudder novels, in which the city is as engaging as the major character. Because of his love for the city, it was inevitable that Block would respond to the attack on the World Trade Center.<br />  In Block's novel the 9-11 incident leads to a rash of murders. Marilyn Fairchild, a party-animal real estate agent, is murdered and the most likely suspect is John Blair Creighton, a writer who had been seen leaving a bar with the woman at closing time. In short order, several gay bars are firebombed and the only tie-in is Jerry Pankow who had cleaned the real estate agents apartment as well as the bars.<br />  Block bends the usual mystery structure in that this case revolves around a femme fatale, Susan Pomerance, an over-sexed folk-art dealer who knew Marilyn. Susan's sexual exploits are integral to the plot. She's got the hots for John Blair Creighton as well as just about everybody else in the book, man and woman. Something you should know: Lawrence Block started his career writing for girlie magazines and he never got over it. Some of the scenes are sexually explicit. If you're the squeamish type, this book may not be for you. Block also has a wicked sense of humor. Through Creighton, Block rabbit punches the publishing industry who gets involved in a bidding war over Creighton's next book due to the murder indictment. Block also seems to be saying something about America's sexual hangups, as he portrays Susan as an erotic artist rather than a nymphomaniac.<br />  Technically, I found this book to be a bit challenging. It is divided into nice easy-to-read chunks with lots of white space, but it's Block's use of pronouns that provokes. He's under the assumption that the reader has a brain and will be able to figure out who is in the scene through context clues. As a result I lost track of an important clue. A Zuni fetish, a small turquoise rabbit is missing from Marilyn Fairchild's apartment. It winds up in John Blair Creighton's sock drawer. We know who did the bombings and other murders because Block shows him doing them (He's the World Trade Center tie-in), but we're not sure about Marilyn Fairchild. This book was so good I'm tempted to go back and read it again to find out if I missed something. And I never read anything twice.in John Blair Creighton's sock drawer.

The victim's body had been dumped near a quarry in Lompoc, California. Kinsey and two retired detectives take on the eighteen-year-old murder case. Lieutenant Con Dolan convinces her to take the case to help his friend Stacey Oliphant (who was involved in the original investigation) get his mind off his health problems, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.<br />  This is pretty much formulae writing except for the intermittent references to Kinsey's family problems. Her mother and father had been killed in a car accident when she was a little girl. Prior to the accident, her grandmother had disowned Kinsey's mother for marrying beneath her. Now one of her aunt's is trying to reestablishment connections. In order to add comic relief, Grafton also delves into Kinsey's relationship with her nonagenarian landlord Henry and Rosie, his friend and restaurant owner, who's been serving disgusting Hungarian concoctions, such as Pigs Knuckles and Sauerkraut, lately. Another humorous element is Kinsey's fetish for junk food. She corrupts Oliphant, who's never (would you believe?) tasted a Quarter Pounder.<br />  One thing I found irritating was Grafton's penchant for describing every single character Kinsey comes in contact with. A few deft strokes wouldn't hurt, but she goes on and on and on, working in every possible sensory detail and simile. This slows the pace to a crawl.<br />  I thought I had the killer figured out, too. I was wrong, and you will be, too. Grafton didn't give us much of a reason to suspect the eventual culprit. Also she/he is not really believable as a cold-blooded, shovel-wielding assassin. The story also comes to a screeching halt, although Grafton does splice on a little addendum in which we get a look at an artist's recreation of the murdered girl.	2003-02-28

With me, it was the father dying of Parkinsonism.<br /> The plot revolves around Alfred and Enid Lambert and their three children, all of whom are trying to escape St. Jude, the Midwestern town in which they were raised. Gary, the jerkiest of the bunch, is an investment banker. He's so self-centered that when his wife hurts her back, he barely notices. Chip is a former professor of Textual Artifacts (whatever the heck that is) with the sexual appetite of a rabbit. Denise is a self-destructive Philadelphia chef whose dream job at a five-star restaurant proves ephemeral. Enid wants them all home for one last Christmas.<br /> There's not much plot other than wondering when they're going to put poor old Alfred in a nursing home. Franzen's style is mostly narrative summary, but nobody I've read does it better. He also has a penchant for cataloguing, something that ordinarily drives me up a tree. The story runs the gamut of emotion, from hilarity to pathos. There's a scene where Alfred is trying to give himself an enema that's especially heart-wrenching.<br /> Franzen will remind you of that kid in high school with the 4.25 GPA, who was also the president of the National Honor Society, captain of the soccer team and running his own business on the side. He uses words like \\"metempsychotically\\" and his sentences are Faulknerian to an extreme; but I didn't have any trouble staying absorbed. I doubt any other writer working today could show us Parkinsonism, from the inside.	2003-02-26

The book will also validate the contention that if God did not exist, man would have invented him. The Greek gods are portrayed with human foibles: jealousy, anger, trickery. No god was all-powerful. Zeus, for instance, is depicted as being fallible in many ways. Hera was constantly getting the best of him.<br />  When Hamilton turns to the Greek heroes, we once again see how these characters were fashioned according to prevailing value system. Theseus shuns the kingdom of Athens for that of commander-in-chief. He wants to people to be free. We see him in action when the Athenians invade Thebes to force them to bury the five remaining champions who had died trying to elevate Polyneices to Oedipus's vacated thrown. When the King of Argos asks for his help, he calls an assembly to decide. When they conquer the city, he will not let his soldiers sack the city, insisting that the army came only to bury the dead. He then prepares the bodies for burial with his own hands.<br />  Two of the most interesting of the gods are Dionysus and Demeter, the two gods most concerned with humanity. Hamilton uses them to show how winter came about. Demeter's daughter Persephone was kidnapped by Hades, God of the Underworld. When Demeter brought blight to the world, Zeus negotiated a deal whereby for a third of the year Persephone would live in the underworld. In Dionysus's case winter is that time of the year when the God of the Vine was pruned, only the bare stalk remaining. In the springtime, he would revive. He was the assurance that death does not end all. His worshippers believed that his death and resurrection showed that the soul lives on forever after the body dies.<br />  In the last two chapters, Hamilton turns to Norse mythology. The most fascinating thing about them is that they were so fatalistic. The Gods knew that in the end evil would win out and they would be destroyed. The most important thing to the Norse was that they show courage in the face of death.t them is that they were so fatalistic.

If you've read the book and the movie is too faithful to the novel, the movie version is usually a disappointment. If you've read Robert K. Massie's THE ROMANOVS, THE FINAL CHAPTER, you're already familiar with what happened in the basement of the Ipatiev house in Yekaterinburg where the Bolsheviks riddled the family with bullets, so that part of the story is anticlimactic.<br />  The story picks up speed afterwards, however. Romanov fanatics disagree on what happened when Yurovsky and his cohorts set off to bury the bodies. Yurovsky said he burned two of the bodies, but forensic scientists maintain it would have been impossible for him to build a fire hot enough to destroy all of the bones. Over seventy years later, when what was left of the bodies was found, Maria and Alexei (The Heir) are missing. Did they survive? Author Robert Alexander uses this mystery to full effect.<br />  Alexander (Mystery writer R.D. Zimmerman) has spent nearly thirty years in Russia. He knows the language and is able to liberally sprinkle the text with realistic dialogue. He has chosen as his narrator, Mikhail Semyonov, a millionaire living in Lake Forest, Illinois, who is making a tape for his granddaughter Kate, telling her about those final days in the Ipatiev house, where he worked as a kitchen boy. The Bolsheviks had murdered the seven Romanovs, their doctor, their maid, the cook, and the footman, even Jimmy, the little dog, but they let Leonka, the kitchen boy, go just hours before the slaughter. He ostensibly follows the truck as it heads for the Four Brothers Mine where Yurovsky planned to bury his victims. It's raining out and the road is muddy; two bodies fall off of the truck and now we have some suspense. Most accounts of the execution in the basement maintain that bullets bounced off of the jewels the girls had secreted in their corsets and the girls were hard to kill. With the smoke and the confusion it would have been possible for one of the girls to survive. That's how Anna Anderson was able to pass herself off as Anastasia all those years.<br />  Alexander (Zimmerman) switches gears toward the end, after the grandfather's death, when he has the Kate go to Russia, to present the jewels her father smuggled out of Russia to the Hermitage Museum. Kate becomes the viewpoint character and she's a lot smarter than her grandfather gave her credit for being. This is where Alexander pulls off a twist that makes the story well worth reading. Hint, Kate's son is a hemophiliac.been possible for one of the girls to survive. That's how Anna Anderson was able to pass herself off as Anastasia all those years.

There are sixty-nine pages of footnotes, sixteen pages of bibliography.<br />  This is not your conventional biography. Stiles theorizes that James was not the Robin Hood kind of brigand, stealing from the rich and giving to the poor, he's been made out to be by innumerable Hollywood movies and TV shows. Rather he was a product of the bushwacker guerrillas who ravaged Missouri during the Civil War and he kept at it right up until his death in 1882. Stiles also maintains that James was a political outlaw in that part of his purpose was to unseat the Radical Republicans who governed Missouri after the Civil War. Stiles equates James to the modern terrorist.<br />  Quite a bit of the book is devoted to Jesse's relationship with John Newman Edwards, a newspaper editor and \\"voice of the Confederate wing of the Democratic Party in Missouri.\\" Edwards extolled the James gang as rebel heroes, compares them to \\"men who might have sat with Arthur at the Round Table, ridden at tourney with Sir Launcelot or worn the colors of Guinevere.\\" He also edited and published Jesse's letters ridiculing the Radical Republicans and President Grant.<br />  Don't make the mistake of thinking that this is a dull history book. The gang's tangles with the Pinkertons and their Northfield make entertaining reading. The book also fills in some gaps. For instance, there's no doubt Jesse was a murderer. He was involved in a mass execution of union troops during the days he spent riding with Bloody Bill Anderson. These guerrillas defiled the bodies of their victims and took scalps. There's little doubt that Jesse murdered John W. Sheets during a bank robbery as well as the cashier during the Northfield raid and the conductor and two passengers during a train holdup; he even murdered one of the gang members, Ed Miller, Clell Miller's brother. Stiles relates a theory about how Jesse got that way called \\"violentization.\\" According to sociologist Lonnie Athens, there are four stages: brutalization; belligerency; violent performances \\"during which the subject pushes through a psychological barrier, and actually inflicts pain on another person\\"; and virulency, where others fear and applaud the violence. All of these steps fit Jesse like a glove.<br />  The ending of the book is rather disappointing and anti-climactic. Stiles's description of Bob and Charlie Ford's murder<br />adds nothing new. The final chapter,\\"Apotheosis,\\" examines various scholarly takes on the James gang. This gives Stiles another chance to belittle any romantic notions about the outlaws that remain. Stiles spends half of a page telling us what happened to the surviving principals. Frank never spent a day in jail and he and Cole Younger died in bed.o sociologist Lonnie Athens, there are four stages: brutalization; belligerency; violent performances \\"during which the subject pushes through a psychological barrier, and actually inflicts pain on another person\\"; and virulency, where others fear and applaud the violence.

In this one, he's completed the tome and is on his way to the copier, when he is called to the scene of a murder. A councilman has been murdered in the 88th Precinct and the case belongs to Ollie since he was the first detective on the scene. While he's conducting interviews, the valise in which he's placed his masterpiece is stolen from his car. When Ollie finds out his manuscript is missing, he passes the case off to Steve Carella, whose life he'd saved, twice, in MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.<br />  The fun part of this work for me was how McBain describes Ollie's process of writing. We get a short lecture about \\"voice.\\"<br />Ollie reads the best-sellers and arrives at the conclusion that most readers are women and that it might be a good idea for him to assume a female nom de plume. His book is entitled REPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER, and he's become Olivia Wesley Watts.<br />  Every once in a while McBain gives us a glimpse of Ollie's novel, which has been stolen by a transvestite prostitute, who believes the report is real and that there really is a fortune in diamonds to be had if he can only find the basement where Livvy is being held captive. As in most 87th Precinct novels, there's also a subplot involving Bert Kling's former lover, Detective Second Grade Eileen Burke, who with Andy Parker, is investigating a potential drug transaction during which $300,000 is supposed to change hands.<br />  Maybe I'm just getting old, but I had a hard time keeping all of these plot threads straight. When Eileen and Andy appear after side trips to visit Carella and his councilman murder case and Ollie's attempt to track down his book, I had forgotten what their case was about. The councilman's murder is as predictable as dust in a bachelor pad. The drug bust seems like an after thought. The one thing that saved it for me was when Ollie gets a girlfriend. Her name is Patricia Gomez and she's a rookie patrolwoman who helps to crack the councilman's murder. She doesn't see an obese bigot when she talks to Ollie. She wonders at the pain that's causing him to overeat. They make a date to go dancing; Ollie, being Ollie, tries to throw a wrench into the works by besmirching her Puerto Rican ancestry.

Larry feels guilty because he was having sex in the back of his van with his girlfriend, Barbara, when the toddler was snatched.<br />  Seventeen years later, Vivian is a recovering alcoholic, their other daughter Rachel is making peace with her mother, who had psychologically abused her (and locked her in a closet), and Larry is still sneaking around with Barbara and spending a lot of his time \\"venting\\" in the railroad tunnel pictured on the cover.<br />  Despite his philandering, Larry is a generally likable character. He's an astrophysicist working as an administrator for the National Science Foundation, about to take on his dream job, setting up telescopes in Chile for a European consortium.<br />He's not what you'd expect in a scientist. He meets Barbara after slipping on a soiled diaper and twisting his ankle; he slurps Cheerio milk; and when Vivian wants sex, after a long hiatus, he runs two red lights and parks next to a fire hydrant to get her in the sack.<br />  Kinsley provides lots of twists and turns. There's an ersatz rape, during which time we're introduced to Barbara; Larry jogs down the railroad tunnel coming face to face with a train, breaking his arm in the process; Barbara develops a lump on her breast; Rachel is unaccountably accepted at Harvard after a mostly lackluster academic career.<br />  Some of these twists remind one of David E. Kelley's shenanigans in \\"Boston Public.\\" A fourteen-year-old girl ordering sex toys to impress her drama teacher with whom she's having an affair is just one example. The reader generally rolls with the punches, however, as Kinsley keeps us pointed toward a reunion with the lost twin. The best part of the book for me was when Larry flew to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, looking for Karen. Part of the climax involves skiing, and Kinsley works this to the max. Having become suspicious of Larry's lies, Rachel and her boyfriend, Vinnie, follow Larry to Jackson Hole.

If that's the case, there's not much to relate to in THE MURDER BOOK. Alex Delaware is a Yuppie shrink, too concerned with cars, clothes, and fancy restaurants. His girlfriend, Robin, is an even greater bore, so self-possessed that she doesn't see anything wrong with taking off on a months-long rock tour. When Alex gets jealous because a man keeps answering her phone, she doesn't bother to explain that the man is a born-again Christian with a bunch of kids.<br />  Thank God Kellerman varies the point of view in this one, switching between first-person Alex and third-person Milo Sturgis. Milo's background in the gay-bashing LAPD adds some interest.<br />  The plot is convoluted and implausible. It starts twenty years before with the brutal murder of Janie Ingalls, a sixteen-year-old delinquent. It's Milo's first homicide and he's teamed with Detective Pierce Schwinn, a drug-addicted loner with a fondness for prostitutes. Before Milo can even begin to investigate, he's grilled by a team of Internal Affairs officers who want to know if he's aware of Schwinn's illicit activity. Afterwards, he's abruptly transferred to another division.<br />  As the story begins, somebody sends Alex a scrap book, full of gruesome pictures, one of which is Janie Ingalls's scalped, cigarette-burned corpse.<br />  Things are further complicated by the fact that one of the Internal Affairs officers is now the police commissioner. Alex and Milo think he covered up the murder as a favor for some rich developers whose sons were responsible for the girl's death. The other characters include a drug-addicted black man who may have observed the murder; a [handicapped] sister of two of the spoiled rich kids; a handicapped psychologist, who's everybody's benefactor; a billionaire land developer who wants to bring a football team back to Los Angeles, and a female horse rancher who had married the now-deceased Schwinn after the psychologist had weaned him off drugs. His death is also suspicious; he'd been thrown from a usually docile horse.<br />  Back to the subplot, the lovers' quarrel. Looks like it's the end of the road for Robin and Alex.

I almost gave up. Chapter two is a little better because Blanton and Cook introduce us to such stalwarts as Sarah Emma Edmonds, Albert D. J. Cashier, and Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, for whom they have extensive information. Edmonds wrote a best-selling memoir after the war; Cashier, who dressed as a man prior to the war, served out her entire enlistment without being discovered until she was sent to a mental hospital as an old &quot;man,&quot; and Wakeman's letters to her family were preserved. The most entertaining of the three is the feisty Wakeman, who gets into a fight with a fellow soldier and wins. A picture section lets of decide for ourselves whether these women could possibly pass for men.<br />  Rather than rely on the letters, memoirs and newspaper accounts they unearthed, Blanton and Cook spend much of the book dispelling such notions that most women who fought in the Civil War were lesbians, prostitutes or camp followers. They maintain that most of the women fought for the same reasons men did: for the money, for adventure and because of patriotism. But only 240 women can be proved to have served, most under aliases which were almost impossible to track. Blanton and Cook use a sample of 153. From this number they arrive at some rather suspect statistics. Forty-four percent were casualties; eighteen percent were captured by the enemy; their promotion rate was eighteen percent, better than the ten percent cited for men. We're talking over two million men here; I doubt a statistician would allow this sort of comparison.<br />  Some chapters are rather funny.

Ray Atlee is a likable character, a law professor whose wife has left him for a billionaire securities broker. Even Ray's drug addict brother Forrest is compelling. He's a former star football player with a penchant for spearing any defensive player with the audacity to intercept one of his passes. These days his biggest claim to fame is how many days it's been since his last fix. Ray puts off telling Forrest about the money for obvious reasons.<br />  Despite Grisham's staying close to formula here, he does display a facility for satire, taking a poke at high stakes lawyers who take on big tobacco, asbestos companies, and drug conglomerates for fifty percent of the proceeds. There's some wicked humor. At one point one of these sharks, who's just won a big ruling, says, \\"It's a shame we have to share it with the clients.\\"<br />  There's no love interest in this one, unless you count the law student who's after Ray. She shows the complexity of the Ray character. Ray's waiting for her to graduate first. She's also a gold digger, just like his ex-wife.<br />  THE SUMMONS is a good two-day read. Grisham keeps us guessing as to where the money came from, providing several blind alleys. The resolution is right on the numbers, also a little sad. A nice effort from one of our premier storytellers.little sad. A nice effort from one of our premier storytellers.	2002-12-30

There's also a conflicted plantation owner, Ira Jamison, who can't quite own up to his mulatto daughter Flower. And there are some wonderful villains: Rufus Atkins, an overseer on Jamison's Angola plantation, and Clay Hatcher, his second in command. Todd McClain, a New Iberia hardware store owner and leader of The White League is another miscreant.<br />  There's not much of a plot until about two-thirds of the way through the book. Willie and his friends fight the Battle of Shiloh; Willie loses his best friend Jim; he's captured and sentenced to death, only to be saved by a guerrilla band. Willie pines for Abigail Dowling as does his friend Robert Perry, a plantation owner's son who spends the last two years of the war in an Ohio prison camp.<br />  Things pick up after the war when Carrie LaRose, madamn of New Iberia's house of ill repute, sponsors a school for the newly freed slaves conducted by Abigail and Flower, whom Willie had taught to read prior to the war. Carrie pays for it with her death. Flower begins to carry a gun. Ira, who was wounded during The Battle of Shiloh, converts his plantation into a prison camp, a reference to the modern Angola prison. There's an epilogue at the end that resolves everything. What's refreshing is that some of the bad guys get away with it, as they do in real life.<br />  If you like Owen Parry's Civil War novels, you might want to try this one. Parry and Burke are masters of dialect. Burke's  Cajun accent for Carrie LaRose is dead-on perfect, as is Owen Parry's Welsh brogue for Abel Jones. They both also have a penchant for laying on the imagery with a trowel rather than a brush, the problem being that the pace slows and there's always a chance of repetition. The skin tightening over a character's face happened a bit too often in Burke's novel for this reader.Burke's novel for this reader.	2002-12-29

There's a lot to like about A COLD DAY FOR MURDER. Kate Shugak is a much more realistic character than most female private eyes on the best-seller list. She's an Aleut Indian and former investigator for the Anchorage District Attorney's office, but at the beginning of the story, she's returned home to the Alaskan northland, sulking about a case gone wrong during which she was brutally injured. She's been hiding out, pretty much living a hermit's existence when Jack Morgan, her former boss and lover, shows up to ask her to investigate the disappearance of a Park Ranger, who's been missing for six weeks, and one of his investigators who went looking for him. Coincidentally, the park ranger is also a Congressman's son.<br />  The best part of the book is the atmosphere. It's cold up there and people get around by snow machine and plane or helicopter. Everything is expensive because it must be flown in. There's moose hunting and played out gold and silver mines and drunken Aleuts whose favorite pastime is fighting. The Aleut families are close-knit and there is reverence for seniors, as is evidenced by Ekaterina, Kate's grandmother, one of the first people Kate talks to about the case. She's the former president of the Native American Council and she plays dumb about what happened. The Aleuts hate Outsiders and a missing park ranger doesn't concern them much.<br /> The structure of A COLD DAY FOR MURDER is pretty straight-forward. Shugak, and her dog Mutt, a part wolf Siberian husky, track the ranger's movements the day he disappeared. He wasn't too popular, being a greenie and all and recommending that the park be opened for Outsiders. The dialogue is sometimes repetitive and any astute reader can figure out who done it by about mid book. But I'm so starved for a Hillerman replacement that I plan to order another Kate Shugak mystery.	2002-12-24

At the age of sixteen he manages to forge a pilot's license and \\"deadhead\\" his way around the country bouncing checks. He also passes himself off as an pediatrician, a college professor, and an assistant district attorney. The last is probably his most impressive exploit, as he passes the bar exam (on his third try) with only two years of high school.<br />  After years of exploiting the gullibility of bank tellers and airline clerks, Abagnale is finally captured in France, where he spends six hellacious months in a Devil's Island of a prison. He is then transferred to a Swedish prison, a one hundred and eighty degrees difference, more like a college dorm than a prison. He could've spent the rest of his life being handed from one European penal system to another, some of them vying for brutality with France, but he is saved by a Swedish judge who extradites him to the U.S. Back home, he escapes from apprehension at the airport and from prison later, embarrassing the F.B.I. and his nemesis agent O'Reilly. But, by then, just about every law enforcement official in America is on the lookout for him. He is ultimately captured and does four years jail time, only to emerge once more smelling like a rose. After a few years bouncing around doing such scut work as managing a grocery store and a pizza joint, he convinces a bank manager to let him give a lecture to his employees on how to spot a \\"paperhanger.\\" From there, he's referred to another bank and another and so on. These days he teaches at the F.B.I Academy.<br />  There is a brief question and answer section at the end of the book in which Abagnale decries the leniency of our American penal system; surprisingly, he prefers the French method, which reminded me a lot of the dungeons in THE GULAG ARCHIPELAGO. Also, don't expect to see much of Agent O'Reilly. This is a first person account for the most part, with only an occasional reference to the F.B.I. agent's dogged determination.al reference to the F.B.I. agent's dogged determination.	2002-12-12

Patricia Cornwell knew practically nothing about Jack the Ripper before being invited on a tour of Scotland Yard. She says she didn't even know how his victims died or that they were prostitutes. Her interest was in using him in a Scarpetta novel. When she asked Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve if anyone had ever tried to use modern forensics methods to solve the murders, Grieve mentions artist Walter Sickert, who painted a picture entitled \\"Jack the Ripper's Bedroom.\\" Rather than examine the evidence, consider the various suspects, and seize upon the most likely killer, Cornwell is immediately hooked on Sickert.<br />  Sickert is as good a choice as any, actually, at least as good as Montague Druitt, the Duke of Clarence, physician John Gill, or Aaron Kosminski. What bothers me most is Cornwell's blatant hubris. It's been a hundred and fourteen years since the murders; yet, she knows better than the fumbling detectives who worked during the original time frame, one of whom (Sir Melville MacNaghten) had the audacity to write a book about the murders, choosing Kosminski as his Ripper.<br />  Cornwell's chosen structure is also aggravating. She spurns a preface or introduction, which would have given her a chance to explain how she came about writing the book in her own voice. Instead, she interrupts the narrative flow, consistently interrupting to explain her superior forensic technique. So, what does she come up with? Sickert was sexually impotent, having had three operations on his penis prior to age six, possibly without anesthetics. She loves that word \\"possibly\\", also \\"maybe\\" as well as the words \\"could have.\\" As a result of the painful operations, Sickert hated women. This despite the fact that he was married three times. \\"Possibly,\\" he married them for money or \\"maybe\\" because he needed a mother figure. What else? Sickert loved attention; he wrote hundreds of letters and articles for the newspapers. Thanks to Cornwell's legion of researchers, she finds watermarks on the Ripper's letters that match Sickert's stationery. She also decides that most of the Ripper letters were genuine. The authorities were hoaxed by the different handwriting, and Sickert, being an artist, could imitate many different styles.<br />Another aspect of the letters she finds incriminating is the Rippers's persistent use of \\"Ha! Ha!\\" Once again that points at Sickert, whose mentor James McNeil Whistler was notorious for that annoying laugh.<br />  One wonders how Cornwell can look herself in the mirror when she implies Macnaghten wrote his book for money. Listen to this drivel: \\"`I hate this book, Ester (her agent). . . .' I was losing my life to Walter Richard Sickert. He was taking it away from me. `I want to write my novels,' I said. `I don't want to write about him. There's no joy in this.'\\"<br />  There's not much joy in reading the results either.

I'm a sucker for anything remotely connected to the Romanovs. I'm read Massie's NICHOLAS AND ALEXANDRA; Salisbury's BLACK NIGHT, WHITE SNOW; Massie's THE ROMANOVS, THE FINAL CHAPTER; MICHAEL AND NASTASHA (about Nicholas's brother, who was also murdered); I've even read ANNA ANDERSON (I was totally sold until the DNA results proved her a fraud) and the specious THE ESCAPE OF ALEXEI.<br />  As a result, there wasn't much new about Erickson's ALEXANDRA. I didn't know, however, that she was almost twenty-two and worried about becoming a spinster before she married Nicholas. Erickson portrays Alexandra as a shy, yet willful and intelligent woman. But there isn't much evidence to prove the latter. Alexandra interfered in government, putting pressure on Nicholas to assume command of the Russian armies during WWI and to appoint Rasputin's friend, Boris Sturmer, as a minister in the government. She also had him take Rasputin's comb along as a talisman. Alexandra shows symptoms of a borderline manic-depressive, alternating periods where she took to bed with migraine headaches with days working herself ragged at military hospitals.<br />  Many of the dramatic turns of the last tsar's reign are glossed over: Bloody Sunday, Rasputin's assassination, the stampede during Nicholas's coronation, even the murder scene in Ekaterinburg. There is some new material concerning Rasputin's son-in-law, Boris Soloviev, who tried to help the Romanovs escape before being arrested. We also learn that Alexandra managed to smuggle numerous messages past the Bolshevik guards, one of which found its way to the Cheka.<br />  A major disappointment was the dearth of pictures, only eight pages. The daughters also receive scant attention.<br />  I found the footnotes and the bibliography beneficial. We find out what happened to Boris Soloviev and others. Some of the titles seem intriguing, Bykov's THE LAST DAYS OF TSARDOM, and especially Rasputin's murderer Prince Felix Yusupov's LOST SPLENDER.	2002-11-29
US	52809057	RWDWCA9CB0JK7	0743221990	736731828	The Stone Monkey: A Lincoln Rhyme Novel (Lincoln Rhyme Novels)	Books	4	21	22	N	N	Better than THE BONE COLLECTOR	THE STONE MONKEY is by far the best in Deaver's Lincoln Rhymes series. The main plot line revolves around Lincoln's effort to stop THE Ghost, a notorious Chinese \\"snakehead\\" (human smuggler) from killing what's left of two dozen illegal Chinese immigrants. When the coast guard zeroed in on the ship carrying the \\"undocumenteds,\\" The Ghost had dynamited the ship, killing most everyone on board, except for two families and an undercover cop who manage to make it to shore.<br />  This is the best of the series because of the research Deaver did on Chinese culture, specifically smuggling of human cargo. The book is generously sprinkled with such terms as \\"ju-jia\\" or piglets, the derogatory term for the people in the hold of the ship; \\"Meiguo,\\" Chinese for Beautiful County or America, and \\"bangshou,\\" the lieutenant who helps The Ghost accomplish his task.<br />  The book is also replete with solid characterization, the best of which is Sonny Li, a Chinese detective disguised as one of the illegals. He clashes with Lincoln by smoking unfiltered Camels at crime scenes and by taking a much more humanistic approach to crime detection, as opposed to Lincoln's emphasis on the evidence. Li's favorite expression is \\"Ten Judges of Hell\\" in reference to the Chinese myth that the judges of hell keep a record of everyone who has ever lived, their faults and good points.<br />  I've had problems with Deaver's loosey-goosey approach to plotting in the past; however, in this work, he manages to keep it real for the most part, except for one minor glitch where he has the Ghost switch places with one of the Chinese dissidents. The dissident has police protection, since the Ghost is out to kill all of the survivors, but that doesn't stop Deaver from having him sneak out and get involved in a gun battle or two. Despite this slight quibble, I'd put Deaver right up there with Ed McBain as one of the best at police procedural. It's easy to follow the case as it progresses as Rhymes has his assistant Thom write the clues on a bulletin board. We see these several times throughout the book as Rhymes analyzes new crime scenes. This is a good one; you'll get your money's worth.assistant Thom write the clues on a bulletin board. We see these several times throughout the book as Rhymes analyzes new crime scenes.

There are too many similarities to ignore. The book is set in Alexandria, Mississippi, just a stone's throw from Maycomb, Alabama. Harriet Cleve Dufresnes, the lead character, could be Scout Finch six years later. The villain of the piece, Farish Ratliff, will remind you of Bob Ewell. Harriet even has a little boyfriend who worships the ground she walks on.<br />  Harriet is a great character, feisty and brave, willing to take on a copperhead in order to get even with Danny Ratliff, whom she blames for the murder of her brother who'd been found hanging from a black-tupelo tree when she was a baby. Just as captivating are Harriet's great aunts, Edie, Addie, Libby, and Tat. These are truly original characters; no one has written senior citizens better since LADIES OF THE CLUB. Edie, Harriet's grandmother, is an older version of Harriet. When she looks Harriet in the eye, she sees herself looking back at her.<br />  This is a finely textured book, with lots of atmosphere and<br />folklore that Tartt positions between action sequences. Tartt is great at foreshadowing. There's a scene at the beginning where Harriet learns how to hold her breath (like her hero Houdini) that will come in handy later on.<br />  There's so much to like about this book I have to give it at least a four, but it's not a seamless novel. There's too much description, the kind that the author had to have put in later to give the book verisimilitude. Much of this is repetitive, lots of light playing off of the sides of buildings. I'm not the type to skip description, but I can understand why some readers might want to skim over some of this. The ending is also disappointing, leaving the reader dangling. Any mystery lover (as I am) is going to want to throw the book up against the wall when he finishes. What happens to Danny Ratliff is also completely unrealistic. You'd think at least one of the forty-some people Tartt thanks in her acknowledgments would have balked at some of this.y-some people Tartt thanks in her acknowledgments would have balked at some of this.	2002-11-12

Larry McMurtry is still cranking out the gothic westerns.<br />  SIN KILLER is the first offering of a four-volume work set along the Missouri River in the 1830's. An English family that includes Lord and Lady Berrybender and their fourteen children along with their entourage is bent on exploring the untamed American West. The cast of characters numbers fifty-eight (Don't worry, there's a glossary), headed by Tasmin Berrybender, a willful young lady who falls in love with Jim Snow (think Jim Bridger) and is nonplused when he doesn't hang on her every word and deed. The other plot line involves how often Lord Albany Berrybender gets himself in some kind of pickle, shooting off his toes at one point, getting caught in a blizzard in another.<br />  Twelve-year-old Mary Berrybender was perhaps the most engaging character. She is erudite beyond her years and has mysterious powers, the ability to sniff out edible roots, Jerusalem artichokes, tubers, onions.<br /> Ever since LONESOME DOVE and Blue Duck, I've been impressed with McMurtry's facility with Indian names. In this one, we've got Big White, The Hairy Horn, Neighing Horses, Blue Thunder, and Cat Head. Three of these are old men being escorted back home from a parley in Washington D.C. by Toussaint Charbonneau (the guide on the Louis and Clark expedition). He keeps losing them when the steamboat snags on a sandbar.<br />  There's lots of ravaging and fornication going on, rather much if you're the prudish sort. McMurtry is having a wonderful time making fun of nineteenth century aristocracy. SIN KILLER would qualify as a comic novel if so many characters weren't falling down stairs breaking their necks or being hacked to death by axes. The novel also comes to a screeching halt, abrupt, even for a four-part novel.	2002-10-31

There's a factoid here and a factoid there: Moe was a Shakespearean actor on the Mississippi river boats. Larry could've been a concert violinist. Curly had four wives. Shemp was a hypochondriac. The Stooges' father, Solomon, had a bit part in one of their shorts.<br />  The truly interesting stuff--Ted Healy's murder, Curly's stroke, Shemp's sudden death--is given short shrift. The Stooges were in their thirties when they began to make the shorts. I would have liked to know more about their vaudeville careers. Moe's daughter is still alive. I don't think Fleming made full use of her as a source.<br />  Fleming spends a chapter trying to explain why men and boys love the Stooges; whereas, women seem to hate them. Guys like violence. Slapping people is funny. \\"The Stooges were a beacon of hope to the average underachieving male who could watch a trio of homely midgets with comical haircuts romance stunningly beautiful platinum blondes a foot taller than they, even though they were either unemployed or absolutely incompetent in menial jobs.\\"<br />  Mel Gibson wrote the foreward for the book and Mel Brooks tries to explain Stooge appeal, as does Danny Jacobson, co-creator of MAD ABOUT YOU. The text is complete by page 138. Part three is a capsulization of the 190 shorts the Stooges made. They don't make a whole lot of sense; I don't know if that's Felming's fault or the cobbled together plot lines. All I know is they were really hard to read.<br />  As the title indicates, this is an illustrated history; unfortunately, the illustrations are mainly professional. There is one nice one of the Horwitz brothers' parents, Jennie and Solomon (She looks like Curly, he resembles Moe), but not much else.	2002-10-28

It offers vignettes about Dorothy's children Bobby and Anna Lee, her ninety-eight-year-old Aunt Elner, and Macky and Norma Warren, characters in the previous novel. In one Bobby climbs to the top of the water tower only to find how insignificant Elmwood Springs and its people looked from this vantage point. He realizes how small he is in relation to the vast scheme of things. In another one of these &quot;blackouts,&quot; Aunt Elner tries to poison the son of the town bully for hitting her cat with a rock.<br />  The book moves along at a brisk pace, extending from 1946 to the 90's. Flagg is a great storyteller, emphasis on the &quot;teller&quot;.<br />About halfway through she must've realized there was no real plot because that's when she introduced Hamm Sparks who runs for governor. This was probably a mistake, because it takes us away from Elmwood Springs, the real focus of the story. Flagg has an habit of tweaking the plotline in the narrative, killing off a Hamm Sparks here, Dorothy Smith there without developing these twists in dramatic scenes. Her engaging southern voice saves the day, however; it's like schmoozing with a neighbor across the back fence.	2002-10-21

Box's first novel.<br />For one thing, the protagonist, Joe Pickett, is a game warden in Twelve Sleep, Wyoming, a great setting. Box also does a good job with complications when a local hunting outfitter is found murdered in Joe's backyard. Joe had caught the outfitter poaching, but had been relieved of his gun when he'd begun to write the citation (Joe is much more fallible and believable than a lot of genre heroes). The game warden whom Joe had replaced is a local legend who'd quit his job to work for InterWest, a natural gas pipeline company with plans to build across the state(Unless those persnickety environmentalists find a reason to squelch matters). Joe is also having trouble making ends meet on his salary and his mother-in-law, who's always felt he wasn't good enough for her daughter, Marybeth, arrives to help with the children. The legendary game warden offers Joe a job with InterWest and he's tempted to take it. When two more dead outfitters are found and a possible suspect is also gunned down, most everybody is satisfied that the case has been solved. Except Joe. It's all much too cut and dried for him.<br />  Probably the most engaging character in the book is Joe's seven-year-old daughter, Sheridan, who witnessed \\"the monster\\" stumble into Joe's backyard and pass out on the woodpile, leaving a little box full of animal feces from several Miller's weasels, an endangered species, whom Sheridan takes on as pets.<br />  The plot of OPEN SEASON leaves a bit to be desired. There's an ambiguous chapter where a man, who's been watching her play with the weasels, threatens Sheridan. There are only two possible suspects, and when you eliminate the obvious one, there's only one. And he's too much of a maniac to be credible.	2002-10-09

Kaminsky hints at the influence by having Rostnikov carry around an Ed McBain novel as he pursues various leads.<br />  The title refers to an apparent mental patient who interrupts Rostnikov's visit to his wife Sarah's hospital room, where she's recuperating from a brain tumor operation. The man is naked and ranting about devils invading the shoe factory where he works. Rostnikov decides to investigate. A second case deals with a woman complaining that her son is about to assassinate a Politburo member. A third has to do with the disappearance of Bus 43 and its driver Boris Trush.<br />  All of these threads occur prior to the dissolution of the USSR, during the time of Gorbachev and glasnost. Any case involving the Politburo is dangerous territory for Rostnikov and crew. This is exacerbated when the reader realizes \\"The Washtub\\" is being tracked by the KGB.<br />  I was so looking forward to another Rostnikov novel that I inadvertently read this one a second time. You'd think I would've remembered that title.	2002-10-01

I guess I was expecting something like Anne Rule's THE STRANGER BESIDE ME. I didn't get it.<br />  Olsen made an unwise decision when he gave Jesperson a format for rationalization and blame. Much of the book is written in first person. Jesperson describes all eight of his murders in graphic, brutal detail. He calls the prostitutes he murdered, &quot;lot lizards,&quot; he blames his father for his becoming a serial murderer. Olsen includes their letters at the end, many of them contradictory and almost incoherent. The father is worried about being blamed (because of his drinking and the corporal punishment he used to disciple his son).<br />  When Jesperson starts to unravel, we see him driving his eighteen wheeler without his lights on and abusing fellow motorists by nudging them with his truck. The problem with this is that the man is such a inveterate liar, it's hard to know whether to believe it.<br />  There's also a bumptious section about Jesperson's life in prison. He starts a pen pal club with other serial murderers. The man is so heavily into self-delusion that any forum will do. Jesperson's father never does stop visiting his son; he even suggests that they publish a book together (Was the end result this book?). In any event, the acorn definitely didn't fall too far from the tree.	2002-09-26

From Christmas Day 1941 until the end of WWII, the people of North Platte, Nebraska, met every troop train that stopped at their railroad terminal, providing coffee, candy, apples, sandwiches, birthday cakes and other treats. Green's book is replete with testimonials attesting to how much this meant to our boys in uniform. One of the most touching anecdotes was about a sixteen-year-old from Chicago who had enlisted and been sent to San Francisco. The military authorities there found him out; he admitted he wasn't old enough and was given his discharge. He hitchhiked back across country, stopping to rest at North Platte. The ladies arranged a ride to Omaha with the promise of another to Chicago. The ladies also collected seven dollars to tide him over until he got home.<br /> Green tracked down some of the ladies and young girls who worked at what became the North Platte Canteen. One of them had a sister whose name had been put in a popcorn ball as a possible pen pal for one of the soldiers. He wrote to her, asking if she had a sister who'd be willing to write to his buddy. The sister ultimately married the soldier's friend, although she never actually worked at the Canteen.<br />  Between testimonials, Green walks through the town, visiting the place where the Canteen (which was torn down by the Union Pacific in the middle of the night) used to stand. The trains no longer stop in North Platte. Downtown is pretty much deserted. He wonders where all of the people are. He can't find them at the local mall. One day he stops at the local Wal-mart and there they are. He thinks they congregate there because they feel at home at Wal-mart's. Because most Wal-marts are the same, they know what to expect. Green pretty much scorns so-called progress: he's down on freeways, airplanes, and television. The freeways bypass towns like North Platte; the planes fly over them, and television keeps people at home, unlike those in 1940's North Platte who came to town on Saturday night just to people watch.<br />  This book had some special meaning for me. As an ex serviceman, I remember how welcoming the ladies at the USO in Chicago were during a weekend pass from Navy boot camp. They didn't fire any live ammo at us there, but the Navy company commanders were brutal just the same.

Trudeau's GETTYSBURG is pretty much a blow-by-blow account of what happened at the great battle. Sometimes the book is overwhelming, too many names, too many brigades and battalions. But Trudeau does have a rather unique perspective on what happened. For instance, he's not as down on General Daniel Sickles as most historians. He feels that Sickles' positioning of his Corps in the Peace Orchard on the second day of the battle wore down Lee's men. This notion is somewhat validated by the fact that Sickles won the Medal of Honor. Trudeau also portrays General Lee as indecisive in that he waited too long to commit to a full-scale battle and ignored Longstreet's suggestion that the Army go around the Union army and look for a defensive position. The Union's left flank was never properly scouted and Longstreet was surprised by Sickles' positioning of his Corps.<br /> Trudeau also casts doubt on Joshua Chamberlain's famous &quot;right wheel&quot; command during the struggle on Little Round Top. He agrees that there was a bayonet charge but that Chamberlain had embellished matters in &quot;subsequent recountings of the fight.&quot;<br />  I was a bit disappointed by the absence of pictures. God knows, thanks to Matthew Brady, there are enough of them. I also had a hard time with the maps. Many of them ignore place names and I had trouble orienting myself.<br />  One selling point was the afterward which told us what happened to the many, many people mentioned in the book. One surprise was General Pickett, whom I had thought of as a dandy and a typical southern cavalier. Trudeau says that notion was due to his letters which were published (heavily edited or fictionalized) posthumously by his wife. I also liked Trudeau's liberal sprinkling of reactions from Gettysburg townspeople. Teenager Daniel Skelly, for instance, seemed to be overjoyed at the possibility of a full-scale battle in his own backyard.<br />  This book was definitely worth the time it took to read it and brought the three days of battle into clearer focus.rought the three days of battle into clearer focus.	2002-09-18

It's really about Frank Bascomb's response to the death of his son and his subsequent divorce. Frank turns to women, eighteen affairs from the time of his son's death to the present. Ironically, his wife divorces him when she finds letters resulting from a platonic relationship. Frank looks for other ways to cope. He joins a Divorced Men's Group. They go fishing together. One of them tells Frank about a homosexual relationship. Frank would rather have his wisdom teeth pulled, but he listens like a professional mensch.<br />  Frank once wrote a book of short stories that was optioned by a movie company, then started on a novel. When the publisher of a national sports magazine calls asking if he'd like to write for them, he jumps at the chance. He doesn't particularly like sports but finds the writing easier than working on a novel.<br />  I found the minor characters more interesting than Frank. His girlfriend, Vicki Arcenault, a feisty nurse from Texas sees through Frank and pops him in the nose when he won't admit to himself how he really feels about her. Frank's ex-wife is a golf instructor, who still has a bit of a thing for Frank, but insists on giving the WPGA a try rather than try again with Frank.<br />  Ford's style is a bit grating. The book is written in first person narrative with few dramatic scenes. Most of the time Frank is reflecting on his New Jersey neighborhood, his relationship with his living children, a difficult assignment with a paralyzed football player etc. etc. If you're used to reading hard-boiled mysteries as I am, you might find this one a bit tedious.	2002-09-05

In MYSTIC RIVER Lehane takes the time to introduce us to the characters, one of the best expositions I've read. In SACRED he starts in the middle of the action, Kenzie and Gennaro being kidnapped and drugged by a ruthless billionaire who wants them to find his missing daughter.<br />  All of the characters are overblown: Kenzie and Gennaro might as well be twins, both of them hard-boiled detectives who don't shrink from violence. Gennaro breaks a woman's nose with a right cross at one point.<br />  The story is also melodramatic and corny in spots. The `sacred\\" in the title refers to Kenzie and Gennaro's burgeoning romantic relationship. At one point Gennaro is buried alive up to her neck, and the only thing that saves her, besides a conveniently-placed rock, is her sacred love for Kenzie. Blech!<br />  Lehane has little regard for suspension of disbelief. The billionaire is way over the top. He's about to die, he wants to have himself cryogenically preserved, he's able to destroy Kenzie's credit rating and clear his bank account with a phone call. He has a coterie that will remind you of mafia soldiers.<br />  Another thing that bugged me was Lehane's constant references to previous books I hadn't read. He assumes you're a fan or you wouldn't be reading SACRED. I picked up two paperbacks in a bookstore after I'd read MYSTIC RIVER, hoping for a repeat performance. I didn't get it.	2002-08-26

If for nothing else, read HONOR'S KINGDOM to observe a master of dialect in action. In this fourth book in the series, the wonderful supporting cast is missing. Abel Jones travels to London alone to deal with the murders of Union agents who have been trying to prevent the building of a Confederate warship. In the process we are introduced to a cockney dance-hall girl, and when Abel travels to Glascow, a Scottish police inspector, whose accents are dead on. And noticeably different. These accents don't distract from the story at all. They make the characters come alive.<br />  Another good point is Parry's deft use of historical figures, in this instance, Charles Francis Adams, ambassador to England, and Benjamin Disraeli.<br />  Once again Parry's humor is wonderful. Jones says at one point, &quot;The price of beefstake would have bought a cow back in America. And wanton expenditure is sinful . . . .&quot; Parry perfectly captures Jones's penurious nature.<br /> One new aspect is the introduction of Abel Jones's Moriarity, the Earl of Thretford, who is helping the Confederates christen their ship.<br />  The problem I had with the book was the long involved plot.<br />Jones is constantly wandering down blind alleys and always seems to end up in the worst part of town. One would suspect this is a social commentary rather than a historical novel. There are so many characters and so many diplomatic imbroglios it's hard to tell who did what even at the end of the book.<br />  Jimmy Molloy would have been a great confidant if Parry had been able to think of a reason to have Jones bring him along.	2002-08-19

I've read at least three books by Evan Hunter, CRIMINAL CONVERSATION, PRIVILEGED CONVERSATION, AND CANDYLAND, the last of which he wrote with his alter ego, Ed McBain. I've read about half of McBain's 87th Precinct series. I liked all of the Hunter books and loved all of the 87th Precinct novels. Hunter loves them, too; his writing comes alive when he writes about Steve Carella, Meyer Meyer, and the boys. That's not happening in THE MOMENT SHE WAS GONE.<br />  There isn't one single character in TMSWG that I liked. The narrator, Andrew Gulliver, is a jerk and a whiner. His twin sister, Annie, is schizophrenic. For thirty-six years the Gulliver family is in denial about Annie's mental health. Andrew doesn't even believe it when Annie hits his wife with a hammer. And he wonders why she divorces him after only three years of marriage.<br />  \\"Gross\\" would be a good word to describe some of the scenes and flashbacks. Annie returns from Indonesia with lice; she urinates on the leg of a policeman; she makes jewelry in the form of male and female sex organs. No, this just won't do. Certainly schizophrenia is not a pretty thing to behold, but a dramatic portrayal of mental illness must be believable. Better to read I NEVER PROMISED YOU A ROSE GARDEN or THE BELL JAR.	2002-08-08

I had also read a previous account of Mary Jemison, a white women who lived her entire life with the Indians. She willingly stayed it seems as she was given the opportunity to return to her own people a number of times. Mary was sixteen in 1758 when she and her family were taken by a Shawnee raiding party. She is adopted by two Seneca sisters and given the name Two-Falling Voices. She resembles their brother who'd been killed in battle and is taking his place.<br />  THE WHITE is a small book, only two hundred nineteen pages with lots of white space. Larsen alternates between Mary's own voice and third person. It's hard to know if the italicized material is Mary's actual voice or a fictionalized version of what she said in A NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF MARY JEMISON: THE WHITE WOMAN OF THE GENESEE, by James Everett Seaver, M.D., which was first published in 1823.<br />  Despite its brevity, I was impressed by a number of things. Mary's first husband, Sheninjee, was not the chauvinistic warrior of countless Hollywood movies. He woos Mary by helping her hoe corn. He dies on a trading mission and she takes a second husband, Hiokatoo, an ancient warrior who'd fought in countless battles. He likes to brag about the number of scalps he's taken, and at first Mary is offended by this, until they discuss it. The discussion sounds like something out of Margaret Meade. Larsen emphasizes the fact that the Indians did not invent scalping. The French put bounties on the heads of the aboriginals and the scalp was evidence.<br />  At the end of her life Mary owns 10,000 acres of land, but she also loses three of her sons who killed each other, their brains pickled by drink. The funeral eulogy is quite shocking. \\"Go! Get out of here! Better that in your cowardice you are gone.\\"<br />  Larsen also likes to mix in quotes from the Bible, often referring to Job and by comparison Mary. Of Mary Jemison, James Seaver says, \\"Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars.\\" There's more, but it's obvious that he had enormous respect for this woman who lived among \\"savages\\".on, James Seaver says, \\"Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars.\\" There's more, but it's obvious that he had enormous respect for this woman who lived among \\"savages\\".	2002-08-03

Times best-seller list	THE LOVELY BONES works on three different levels: as an unconventional mystery, as a view of heaven, and as a Kubler-Ross kind of analysis of the murder of a young girl.<br />  Fourteen-year-old Suzie Salmon is murdered by a neighbor, having been enticed into a cornfield to look at this room he'd built underground. Almost immediately her father suspects Mr. Harvey, the neighbor, but there's not even enough evidence to issue a warrant to search his house. Sebold de-emphasizes this aspect of her story, concentrating on how each member of Suzie's family reacts to her death.<br />  The book in narrated by Suzie, most of the time from her gazebo in heaven. Her take on heaven is rather original. Each person has an individual heaven. There's a jock heaven, there's a dog lover heaven etc. Some of them converge, then branch off in other directions. When Suzie's grandmother dies, she's not part of Suzie's heaven. She liked to drink so she's probably with the other party animals.<br />  Then there's the most interesting part of the book, how the family and her friends deal with Suzie's death. The mother, Ocean Eyes as Suzie's father calls her, runs away from her daughter's death. The father is obsessed by Mr. Harvey, going so far as to allow his surviving daughter to search his house. Lindsey, Suzy's sister, copes by holding everything in. There's a funny scene where the clueless high school principal tries to console her, failing miserably. Her four-year-old brother, Buckley, latches on to his father and won't let him out of his sight.<br />  Sebold's portrayal of teenagers is the best I've seen since DeGrassie Jr. High. Ray Singh, the boy Suzie'd kissed before she died, is one of the first suspects because the police found a love note he'd left in Suzy's copy of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. He's east Indian, wants to be a doctor. Ruth Connors, whom Suzy's spirit touches on her way to heaven, becomes a loner poet who sees dead people. Others are more grounded. Lindsey's boyfriend wants to be a carpenter; his brother is a motorcycle head.<br />  The whole point of the book is how the death of a fourteen-year-old girl impacts so many lives. The book is so topical, considering the outbreak of abducted little girls.

Joe Crow is still a cop at the beginning of this one, but he's drinking a lot and doing cocaine. So is his wife, Melinda. He's also working for Sheriff Orlan Johnson, who's under the thumb of the Murphy brothers, who run a big game preserve where clients can hunt endangered species.<br />  When he's fired for being too tough on the Murphys, Crow takes a job as a bodyguard for Dr. Nelson Bellweather, one of the Murphys' best clients. The Murphys think Bellweather has sexually abused and kidnapped George Murphy's son Shawn. Bellweather is the one with the short bankroll; he's a liposuctionist who's been sued more often than Enron. And, of course, he stiffs Joe Crow.<br />  The set-up is a bit implausible as are most of the characters, but Joe Crow and old reliables Sam O'Gara and his gal pal Debrowski make up for them. Crow is such an unconventional hero, you can't help but root for him. He tries to kick cocaine and booze, and he can't get a handle on women, or himself for that matter. His best friend is a cat, who's missing for most of the book.<br /> The little town where Crow works at the beginning of the novel is called Big River. Immediately we Minnesotans are thinking \\"Big Lake.\\" And like Garrison Keillor, Hautman mentions other place names, such as Clara City, Dassel, and Litchfield.<br /> The pace is quite brisk, with lots of action and suspense. There's a tiger chained to the wall at the lodge on the Murphy ranch that we know is going to enter into the story somehow. Not as good as MORTAL NUTS but a lot better than most crime fiction.	2002-07-30

This is genre fiction, a hard-boiled mystery/thriller in the tradition of Robert Parker. PRAYERS FOR RAIN is also the fifth in a series with the recurring characters Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro.<br />  At the beginning private detective Kenzie helps Karen Nichols discourage a stalker. Six months later, she's dead, having jumped from the top of Boston's Custom House. Several weeks before she'd died, Kenzie had neglected to return her phone call, and he feels guilty. He can't believe the same girl (A fifties type with the personality of a Barbie Doll) had become a drug-addicted prostitute.<br />  I always like to reread the blurbs when I finish with a novel, just to see if the reviewers actually read the novel. One mentions the \\"wonderfully rounded characters.\\" Bubba Rogowski, a former special forces operative, is about as rounded as Rambo, and Angela and Patrick aren't much better. They're former partners at the beginning (she's working for a security company), but it doesn't take much foresight to know they'll be back together shortly. The dialogue also bothered me quite a bit; it's supposed to be snappy, but Lehane doesn't know when to quit, and the characters all have the same voice (Lehane's).<br />  There are some pretty good fight scenes in the beginning, but I was disappointed by the climax. One thing about series novels: you always know nothing too bad is going to happen to the main character. We also have, count them, three villains. Lehane had me really hating Cody Falk, the original stalker, but he's soon replaced by Karen's step brother and then by this postal clerk who seems to be impersonating the step brother.<br />  I was really amazed at the difference between this novel and MYSTIC RIVER, which is darn near perfect. At first I thought this might be an early work, but Lehane actually wrote A DRINK BEFORE THE WAR, DARKNESS TAKE MY HAND, SACRED, and GONE, BABY, GONE before this one, so I guess you have to blame it on the genre.ss you have to blame it on the genre.	2002-07-24

On another level, the book is about a young Indian boy who is adopted by a white couple, effectively murdering his identity. Olivia and Daniel Smith try to do everything in their power to make sure that their son, John, learns about his heritage, doing research on Native American history and culture, having him baptized by a Jesuit Indian, taking him to powwows. But the adoption agency refuses to reveal his tribe, and John becomes increasingly alienated. When John is old enough for college, he refuses to go, opting instead for a job working on the last skyscraper in Seattle.<br />  The beginning of the book is quite enjoyable as we meet a number of interesting characters: Marie, a radical student, who attends a class on Native American Literature to heckle the professor; her cousin Reggie, who had been expelled because he'd assaulted the same professor; Jack Wilson, a mystery writer who claimed to be an Indian (he's working on a novel about the Indian killer and he sees John as the human embodiment of Aristotle Little Hawk, his Indian protagonist). Almost everybody in the novel is either an Indian or a wannabe Indian.<br />  The second half leaves a lot to be desired, as young white men take the murders out on homeless Indians, beating them with baseball bats. The Indians fight back, the whites retaliate. Seattle becomes a miniature Middle East. Alexie is also trying to have it both ways, lifting elements of the conventional mystery (The murderer is referred to as \\"the killer\\"; he could be just about anybody in the story) and also trying to make some kind of radical statement: the white man better watch out because the Indians are dancing. I enjoyed THE LONE RANGER AND TONTO FISTFIGHT IN HEAVEN, but this one needed a serious rewrite.	2002-07-19

Some readers might be a bit squeamish about a thirteen-year-old prostitute selling herself during the beginning of George III's reign. But Mary Saunders leads such a drab life that when she trades a kiss for a red ribbon (and gets more than she bargains for), you can't help but fall in love with her.<br />Some of the descriptions are graphic, but if they weren't, the story wouldn't be as believable. As is, Donoghue puts us right there in stinking, squalid 1760 London.<br />  Mary's mother throws her out of the house, and Mary is immediately raped by a troop of soldiers. And that's when the second fascinating character shows up; Doll Higgins, a twenty-something prostitute, saves Mary from the gutter and teachers her how to attract cullies (customers).<br />  Later on, Mary contracts a cold. Doll convinces her she should get herself admitted to Magdalen Hospital for wayward girls. When she gets out, she finds Doll dead in an alley and her landlady wants the rent. Mary is forced to run for her life. She runs to Monmouth, her mother's home town, with a forged letter for her mother's friend Jane Jones, a dress maker. Everybody loves Jane Jones, her only flaw being that she's too bound by convention. There's a hint of that right off when she insists Mary call her ma'am (but only in company). They gossip like school girls otherwise.<br />  Mary Saunders is simply a wonderful character. She's naive and wise, mean and kind, covetous and generous. Her cheekiness gets her in trouble with some of Mrs. Jones's clients. Mary has the life she's always wanted, but she's not satisfied. She wants to go back to London in style and there's only one way to earn the money.<br />  Just as you're thinking what a great character Mary is, Jane Jones touches your heart. And her husband, Thomas, a one-legged stays maker, is almost as endearing. The minor characters are great as well. There's the black maid of all work, Ami, whom Mary thoroughly corrupts when she realizes that she's her own person and should get wages.

Every hero needs a worthy adversary: Sherlock Holmes matched wits with Professor Moriarity; James Bond battled Goldfinger; and in Ed McBain's 87th Precinct, Steve Carella and the boys take on the wily Deaf Man.<br />  In the twelfth number, Meyer Meyer investigates a series of complaints about a caller threatening businessmen. Carella grapples with a homicide, a naked man wearing US Navy shoes. Eventually, via the newspapers, a caller identifies the corpse as John Smith.<br />  Meanwhile, the Deaf Man is hard at work on a caper that will net him two and half million dollars. He's creating diversions based on the Sherlock Holmes story, \\"The Red-headed League.\\" The businesses being threatened are near banks and jewelry stores, and the men of the 87th are spread awfully thin trying to cover every eventuality.<br />  McBain is a clever stylist who works on the reader subliminally. Carella's nemesis is deaf; his other senses are heightened because of it. Carella's wife, Teddy is also deaf. I'd be interested to know if there is some deafness in Evan Hunter's background. Also, when the situation fits, McBain takes a dig at the politically correct. If you don't believe me, get a load of Ollie Weeks (He's not in this one). McBain (Hunter) is also not afraid to combine humor and dramatic action. There's a fantastic twist toward the ending that made me laugh out loud, and I was alone. He's also not afraid to break convention; Carella and the 87th fail as often as they succeed, especially when they're up against the Deaf Man. Also, it's a convention in most mysteries that the hero be involved in the capture of the villain. Carella is in a coma when the Deaf Man is foiled (by a beat cop).<br />  I started reading the 87th Precinct novels way down the line with LULLABY.

When I first dipped into THE SEA WOLF, I was struck by its similarity to CAPTAINS COURAGEOUS. Humphrey van Weydon's ferry-steamer, The Martinez, is rammed by another ship in San Francisco Bay in a heavy fog. Van Weydon is rescued by Wolf Larsen, captain of the seal-hunter, The Ghost. Larsen refuses to take Van Weydon ashore, laughing at his offer of money. Once again, I am reminded of another famous book, MOBY DICK, and Larsen is Captain Ahab. Ruthless and single-minded, Larsen decides to make Van Weydon his cabin boy on this four month trip to provide seal pelts for fashionable American women. Van Weydon resists until Larsen catches hold of his arm and squeezes. A man of letters who freely admits never working a day in his life, Van Weydon does everything he's told from that point on, including aiding and abetting the Captain as he mistreats his crew.<br />  Early on we learn some of Larsen's motivation when he and Van Weydon have a literary discussion. We discover that Larsen is a literary bully. He's never spent a day in school, but he reads Shakespeare, Robert Browning and John Milton. London's theme becomes clear and Larsen and van Weydon argue about immortality, van Weydon declaring that man has a soul; Larsen retorting with a Scrooge-like \\"Bah!\\" And suddenly we have the first gleanings of an existentialist novel. If there were no God, how should man behave? Larsen, seeing evil everywhere he looks, decides he will do whatever is best for him personally.<br />  The conflict is not precisely good versus evil. Van Weydon is a weakling, a pampered rich man, a coward. There is also much to admire about Wolf Larsen. He outduels seven men during a mutiny. He's constantly reading, constantly trying to understand. When Van Weydon's story arc begins to ascend--he learns seamanship, rebuilds the ship when its masts are destroyed--we can't help but give Larsen a bit of credit. Larsen never took no for an answer, no task was too difficult.<br /> Another interesting element in the book is London's fledgling steps toward women's liberation.

Heinz (who also wrote MASH), skip the foreward by Elmore Leonard until you've read the book. The ditz gives away the ending.<br /> Other than that, the book is pretty much what one might expect after reading the blurb by Hemingway: \\"THE PROFESSIONAL is the only good novel about a fighter I've read and an excellent novel in its own right.\\" It reminded me a whole lot of THE SUN ALSO RISES. Rather than the minutia of fishing and bullfighting we get boxing: how to wrap a fighter's hands, how the fighter eats during training (Lots of tea and boiled eggs), how to fake a missed right hand, followed by a left hook. All of this is narrated by a somewhat cynical sports writer named Frank Hughes, who follows middle weight fighter Eddie Brown around as he prepares for a championship bout. Eddie is the professional in the title. He's fought ninety times, losing only three, one of which his manager, Doc Carroll, set him up to lose because he was becoming too cocky. W.C. Heinz has a pretty good reason for entitling the book, THE PROFESSIONAL. Carroll resents the champion because he's pretty much all glitz and show. At one point Heinz has his narrator say, \\"The amateurs have always crowded the highways to everywhere, so it's never been easy for the pros to get through.\\"<br /> I've never been a big Hemingway fan, but this book is chock full of interesting minor characters. There's Eddie's \\"cold fish\\" of a wife. There's Johnny Jay, the trainer, a non-stop talker who never makes a whole lot of sense, but is tolerated because he was Doc Carroll's first fighter. There's Al Penna, who steals a ring off a dead man's finger. But my favorite is Jean Girot the recovering alcoholic who owns the hotel at the training camp. He's sad because he misses his favorite drink, the dry martini, which he took nips from out of a milk bottle.<br /> If you're looking for an action packed novel, this one's not for you. There's really only one fight scene and that's at the end when Eddie fights for the title; but if you're tired of the \\"same old same old\\" THE PROFESSIONAL fits the bill.one fight scene and that's at the end when Eddie fights for the title; but if you're tired of the \\"same old same old\\" THE PROFESSIONAL fits the bill.	2002-06-27

Ayla and Jondalar arrive at the Zelandonii caves. The people are amazed that she's tamed animals, Wolf and Whinnie and Racer. They're even more amazed when she shows them a better way to build a fire and her thread puller (the needle). Later, she saves an injured man by suturing his wounds. By now we should know where this is going. I have to confess that I didn't, until maybe the twentieth time Auel has the head medicine woman/doctor/priest, Zelandoni, ask Ayla if she's ever thought about studying to become a zelandoni (the priests have the same name as the people). If we look at SHELTERS OF STONE, as a transitional novel, it's not as hard to take. Ayla must learn to accept the fact that she has an obligation beyond becoming Jondalar's mate and the mother of Jonayla (I don't think I'm giving anything away there, since I was able to predict the name of the baby as soon as I learned she was pregnant).<br />  Despite its transitional nature, the novel has numerous flaws. There's no plot. There's no real antagonist. Auel fumbles about trying to find one. Laramar, a drunk who won't take care of his children, hates Ayla because she's a foreigner, yet is given a higher status. Brukeval, who's part Neanderthal, loves Ayla but hates himself because he can't admit who is really is. Marona, Jondalar's former girlfriend, tries to embarrass Ayla by giving her clothes meant for a boy. Ayla's so far superior to any of these people that we don't worry much. So then, the only remaining thread is Ayla's journey to become One Who Is First among the Zelandonii. Pretty dry stuff. I would imagine most people wanted to know if Ayla would find Durc, her son by Broud, a truly worthy villain from CLAN OF THE CAVE BEARS. But she's only nineteen in this one, and he would be about eight years old, living far away. You'll have to wait for the final book of the series (if you're willing to read it).<br /> Another flaw would be the constant repetitiveness. It's almost as if Auel was her own editor. That can't be, though; she thanks one in the acknowledgments. The worst example is Ayla's idea that men contribute to the birth of babies. I didn't count the number of times it was mentioned, but it must have been at least two dozen.<br /> There's some clumsy writing going on here as well. The poem at the end of the book is terrible. And the sex scenes are embarrassing.<br /> So now we know why it took Auel twelve years to write this novel. I can hear the arguing now among the editors at Crown. Will anybody buy the next book after suffering through this one? Probably. But the people at Crown and Random House and Scribners and Little Brown should think about delegating their responsibilities to agents and their sales forces. I loved CLAN OF THE CAVE BEARS and the following two, but I won't be reading the next one, I can guarantee you.petitiveness. It's almost as if Auel was her own editor.

The canoe overturns and the girl is pulled into the depths, apparently by some monster.<br />  The next chapter is rather confusing because, suddenly, there are two girls missing and their teacher is a suspect. We are introduced to the protagonist, attorney Bartholomew Christian Crane. Crane works for Lyle, Gederov & Associate, often referred to as Lie, Get `Em Off & Associate. It will be Crane's job to defend the teacher. Graham Lyle is, according to Crane, a raving queen. Gederov is a \\"second-generation Russian immigrant who has somehow retained a threatening hint of his ancestor's accent.\\" He's also, \\"cruel, misogynistic, racist, flatulent, and nauseating dining company.\\" The key word here is \\"misogynistic.\\" So now we have incest and misogyny and a partner who's homosexual...  \\"<br />  Crane is sent to his home town of Murdock, Ontario. Crane's client doesn't seem to care if Crane gets him off or not. Crane doesn't care; all he wants to do is win, but as he begins to piece together a case, blaming someone else, of course, the bizarre legend of the place begins to pull him down. There's a story about the Lady of the Lake and suddenly the prologue begins to make sense.<br />  If you assume the book is going to be about how Crane gets the teacher off, you'll be wrong. Crane begins a search for the Lady of the Lake, apparently an actual person, who fits in well with the misogynistic elements at the beginning.<br /> Too much of a downer for you? Surprise, surprise. Get ready for an O'Henry twist at the end, that cloaks Crane with redemption.	2002-06-20

THE NEW MYSTERY: THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CRIME WRITERS ESSENTIAL CRIME WRITING OF THE LATE 20TH CENTURY, edited by Jerome Charyn, is one of the finest short story anthologies I have read. It seems like everybody's here. If you don't like Joyce Carol Oates's novels, here's something short: \\"How I Contemplated the World from the Detroit House of Correction and Began My Life Over Again\\". It's about a spoiled white girl who goes slumming, gets beat up and sold into servitude. Just the idea makes me tingle all over. Raymond's Carver's \\"Cathedral\\" is also here. The man's a technician. He doesn't tell you anything you don't need to know. If you couldn't plow your way through L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, James Ellroy offers \\"Gravy Train\\". Definitely not politically correct. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is also included with his one-sentence, surreal story \\"The Last Voyage of the Ghost Ship.\\"<br /> I have to say, though, that the real reason I recommend the anthology is because I first discovered Lawrence Block and Stuart Kaminsky in these riveting pages. Read Kaminsky's \\"The Man Who Hated Books\\" and eventually you'll find his Porfiry Rostnikov novels, the best serial going. The man knows more about modern Russia than Putin does. Block's \\"The Merciful Angel of Death\\" will lead you to his Matt Scudder novels. Matt's an ex-alcoholic, detective (without a license) in love with a high-class prostitute.	2002-06-19

I'd never heard of Lawrence Block until I read one of his short stories, \\"The Merciful Angel of Death\\" in THE NEW MYSTERY anthology, edited by Jerome Charyn. I liked the story so much that I was thrilled to find he also wrote novels, which led to A DANCE AT THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE and Matt Scudder. Since then I've read all of the Scudder mysteries and buy the newest one as soon as I hear about it.<br /> So what's so good about Scudder? He's a great character for one thing. He's a recovering alcoholic, a detective without a license, a former cop who left his wife and kids. And he's got some of the seediest friends you'll ever meet. An albino pimp. Mick Ballou, a bar owner who kills people. A high-classed prostitute girlfriend. Then there's T.J., his street-smart partner with a facility for computers.<br /> Scudder walks or takes the subway wherever he goes. He putters around, drinking coffee, going to AA meetings, donating money to the church (any church) when he gets paid for a case. He never seems to make any progress, but his perambulations give us a chance to see New York. Then he finds a tiny thread here, another there, and before we know he's cooking with gas.<br />  In A DANCE AT THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE Scudder takes on the Amanda Thurman murder case. After attending a small dinner party on Central Park West, Richard and Amanda Thurman return to their brownstone on West Fifty-second Street, only to be confronted by burglars who draw guns and herd them into their apartment. They steal his watch, wallet, and Amanda's jewelry, beat Richard, tie him up and tape his mouth; then they rape his wife in front of him. Richard manages to knock the phone off the table, free the tape from his mouth, and call 911. But his wife is dead. The dead woman's brother doesn't believe Richard's story and he hires Scudder to prove Thurman murdered his sister. Scudder's investigation takes us on a journey through New York's \\"snuff\\" film, sex-for-sale underworld.<br />  Lawrence Block learned his craft writing for the pulp magazines, and you sure can tell.

Thought it was a rip-off of CATCH-22. The next thing of his I read was an excerpt from THE THINGS THEY CARRIED. It has to be some of the best writing I've ever read. Martin Brady of BOOKLIST refers to O'Brien's style as \\"faction.\\" O'Brien served as a foot soldier in Vietnam from 1969 to 1970.<br />  O'Brien literally describes the things the grunt soldiers carry: can openers, pocket knives, candy, cigarettes, a toothbrush, extra underwear, comic books. Henry Dobbins, a big man, carries canned peaches. Dave Jensen carries dental floss and bars of soap. Kiowa, a devout Baptist, carries a Bible.<br />  But you know the \\"things\\" in the title are about more than just things. O'Brien says, \\"They carried the soldier's greatest fear, which was the fear of blushing. Men killed, and died, because they were embarrassed not to.\\"<br /> Because the nights are cold, they also carry ponchos. Ted Lavender is afraid, the burden of fear adding to the twenty pounds of ammunition, his flak jacket, helmet, rations, water, toilet paper and tranquilizers he carries. When he's shot, they use his poncho to carry his dead body to the evacuation chopper.<br /> Lieutenant Jimmy Cross carries letters from a coed named Martha. She's an English major; she writes about Chaucer and Virginia Woolf. They're not love letters; Cross dreams about making her love him when he gets back stateside.<br /> O'Brien hooked me immediately when he wrote of Jimmy Cross and Martha. I remember USNTC Boot Camp, waiting for a letter from my girl. I could've been Jimmy Cross. I went in during the Cuban missile crisis and I was a teletype operator serving at Polaris Missile Facility in Charleston, South Carolina, when President Johnson decided to escalate the war. When I got the message asking for volunteers, I immediately ran out and volunteered. Thankfully, BUPERS saved me from my own stupidity.	2002-06-10

Kaku and his fellow theoretical physicists appear to have done what Einstein was unable to do in the last twenty years of his life. Einstein was looking for the Theory of Everything that would make quantum theory jive with his theories of the macro universe. A ten dimensional universe makes the mathematical formulas work. In Hyperspace, the laws of gravity and light merge. Light can be explained as vibrations (or strings) in the fifth dimension. Kaku uses graphics to illustrate the \\"logic\\" of a ten dimensional universe. In a two dimensional universe, or flatland as Kaku calls it, a figure is in jail. Escape is impossible. However, a three dimensional person can reach down and whisk the flatlander out of there into the third dimension. To a hypothetical jailer the flatlander appears to have disappeared. Kaku's string theory maintains that following the Big Bang the dimensions split off into the four we know of and the other six that are too small to see.<br /> So then, what are the implications of a ten dimensional universe? According to Kaku, space can be stretched until it rips or tears, providing a tunnel through space and time. And, voila, we have time travel and access to parallel universes. Think this is foolish speculation? Not if the physicists at the California Institute of Technology have any credibility. They've considered building a time machine, consisting of a wormhole that connects the past with the future. Of course this would require an energy source far beyond our limitations, but all we have to do is look at the past two hundred years for a model. Isaac Newton gave us the laws governing machines, leading to the Industrial Revolution. James Clark Maxwell gave us the fundamental laws of the electromagnetic force, ushering in radio, the telephone, the computer, lasers. In the 1940s when the nuclear forces were tamed we were confronted with the atomic and hydrogen bombs. Any civilization that masters hyperspace theory will become lord of the universe.<br /> Not only does Kaku simplify complicated science for the layman, but he also makes you feel optimistic about the future. Try Michio Kaku's new book VISIONS, in which he talks about conquering aging in the twenty-first century, DNA computers, and fusion engines that may take us to the stars. Not since Carl Sagan have I found a scientist this easy to read.> Not only does Kaku simplify complicated science for the layman, but he also makes you feel optimistic about the future.

Her point in writing this short biography is to do a critical analysis of Dickens's major works, adding personal information where appropriate. She also emphasizes the idea that Dickens was the first modern celebrity. When he decides to divorce his wife, with whom he'd had ten children, his readers are outraged. When he goes on a reading tour, people pack the various venues as if he were a modern rock star. We see him in action, acting out the murder scene in OLIVER TWIST with such passion that Smiley arrives at the conclusion that this probably killed him.<br />  Smiley's professorial tone and syntax is a bit off-putting. Also, when she finally gets around to Dickens's affair with actress Ellen Ternan, she claims, due to Dickens's secretive nature, there's not much to tell. Was he a kind old uncle, offering a struggling actress his support, or was it true, as his daughter seemed to think, that they had children together? It's fun to try to match Dickens's fictional characters with real life persons. Was Estella in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Ellen Ternan, or was she Maria Beadnell, with whom he had an unrequited four-year relationship before he got married?<br /> I would have liked to have seen some pictures of his children, all of whom seemed to be ne'er-do-wells, except for his son, Henry. DICKENS, the 1990 biography by Peter Ackroyd, seems to be a good bet if you want more about his social life. One result of reading the book was that I ran right out and bought OUR MUTUAL FRIEND, the last complete novel he wrote, which Smiley claims is a near-perfect novel.	2002-05-28

When she investigates an abandoned truck, she finds a dead man sprawled in the cab. She doesn't notice any blood, so she assumes he's just another drunk. Bernadette is also a traditionalist, who's worried about the chindi (evil spirits), so she's reluctant to get too close to the body. As a result, she doesn't secure the crime scene and she takes a important piece of evidence with her when she leaves.<br />  Sergeant Jim Chee tries to protect her when it's discovered the dead man had a bullet hole in his back. He calls on Joe Leaphorn to return the snuff box full of sand and placer dust to the crime scene where the FBI can find it. Later, we find out that the dead man was looking for the Golden Calf mine, just as another murder victim had before his death. This is another one of Leaphorn's unsolved cases. Wiley Denton, who'd confessed to the original murder (self defense), tries to hire Leaphorn to find his wife, Linda, who went missing the same day he killed Marvin McKay, a con man who'd been trying to sell him a map to the Golden Calf mine.<br />  Tony Hillerman has become somewhat of a formulaic writer in his old age. Jim Chee's plot line usually involves a woman; Joe Leaphorn, although he's retired, is called in to solve the case, usually connected to one he's been trying to solve for years. There's also usually a Navajo shaman involved, in this case James Peshlakai, a signer of important curing rituals. For me, it's always been about the rituals, The Blessing Way and others, and in the last couple of Hillerman books, Tony's ignored them. Maybe because Chee is no longer studying to become a shaman. In this book, The Big Star Way is central to the plot, but Hillerman never gets around to showing us how it's done. There is one thing that hasn't deteriorated, however, and that's how well Hillerman uses the Navajo Indian Reservation as a setting. There's a map inside the front cover and on the back, and I kept paging back and forth, trying to find place names. Maps are also incidental to the plot.<br />  There's a little teaser at the end, involving Bernadette Manuelito, giving us something to look forward to in the next one. Think wedding. One thing about Hillerman; he reads faster than Grisham or King. I read this in two days and most books usually take me a week. I hope we don't have to wait another two years for the next one.and on the back, and I kept paging back and forth, trying to find place names. Maps are also incidental to the plot.

We know from the synopsis that arson investigator John Orr may have been the most notorious arsonist since Nero. Orr was a brazen offender, setting fires in the middle of the day when customers were in the stores, leading to the death of four at Ole's Home Center in South Pasadena. But he makes one big mistake, leaving his fingerprint on yellow legal paper that was used, along with a cigarette, a rubber band and three matches, to start a fire similar to the one at Ole's Home Center. The fingerprint was almost ignored because of the jealousy between firemen and police arson investigators.<br />  Much of the book involves courtroom gymnastics. There are so many closing statements that you tell yourself, \\"this must be the last one.\\" But you're wrong. There are more of them during the penalty phase and Wambaugh cites them all, practically verbatim.<br />  Wambaugh is also famous for his irreverent narrative tone. This works in CHOIRBOYS, where we assume the narrator is a man in blue, but here he's supposed to be an objective journalist. He refers to jurors, lawyers, and judges as \\"...strange fish that lazily glide, blowing gas bubbles that pop ineffectually on the surface of the litigation tanks in which they live and breed.\\" He likes this strange fish motif so much he uses it over and over again.<br />  All of this said, I'm still looking forward to Wambaugh's next fictional tome. It seems an eternity since FLOATERS.	2002-05-17

She still sleeps in a crib. She and her mother dream about owning their own house. Lark has picked out a Cape Ann she'd found in a catalogue. Trouble is, her father, a railroad clerk, keeps losing their money in poker games. Undaunted, the mother begins to learn how to type, eventually setting up her own little business, saving up five hundred dollars for a down payment.<br /> The best part of Sullivan's novel is the relationship between the mother and the daughter. They're more like sisters than mother and daughter. There's a game they play where Lark pretends to be Mrs. Brown and her mother, Arlene, is Mrs. Erhardt. The minor characters are also quite well drawn. There's Hillyard \\"Hilly\\" Stillman, the WWI victim of shell shock. There's feisty little Beverly Ridza, who teaches Lark how to swim.<br /> Sullivan's novel is a bit melodramatic in spots. Lark's Aunt Betty almost dies twice. Some of the dialogue sounds forced. I was also a bit bothered by Lark's narration. She doesn't sound like any six-year-old I ever heard of. She uses words like \\"inebriated\\" and \\"averred\\". The novel is set during the end of the Depression and the beginning of WWII and I would think the author expects us to imagine the narrator telling the story some time in the future, although she never tells us when that is.<br /> Editors say the beginning and the ending of a novel are the two most important elements, and Sullivan's ending certainly saves the day. She's got us wondering if and when Arlene is going to dump that loser Willie. But for a little kid, leaving her Daddy, even though he beats her for chewing her fingernails, has got to be a traumatic experience. Sullivan's ending is darn near perfect.	2002-05-13

THINGS IN DITCHES starts with the murder of Vicky Johnson, her body discovered by Walleye Wertz, a mentally-challenged man out collecting cans and other valuables jettisoned by passing cars. Jimmy Olsen turns the traditional mystery on its head in that we know who killed Vicky at the beginning. The setting of the novel is Willow River, Minnesota, and the supposed killer is the local butcher, Dutch Cleland. He's such a nice guy that we can't believe he choked Vicky to death. But Cleland admits that he did it. At first he thinks about killing himself, but rejects the idea. He doesn't want to traumatize his wife, Jean, any more than she's already been by his long past affair with Vicky. He decides to head north to his cabin instead. Oh yeah, there's a snow storm coming.<br />  The novel includes about the best description of a snowstorm I've read. Cars are submerged by snowplows; there's a whiteout; the temperature plummets below zero after the snow; there's a brutal windchill. And some of the characters actually like it that way.<br />  Olsen also does a bang-up job with characterization. My favorite is the town Chief of Police, Charlie Benson, who gets less respect than Rodney Dangerfield. Charlie and his dispatcher, Marlene, have a kind of school marm, remedial student relationship. Charlie usually does what she tells him to do.<br />  There are a few things that bother me about the book. The constant interruptions in the storyline are annoying. Olsen decides he better introduce us to Vicky. He takes us on a scuba diving vacation in Honduras. This flashback goes on and on and on. Meanwhile we're wondering what's happening with Dutch and Vicky's two ex-husbands, one of them a homicidal maniac, who are after him. Several chapters later Olson flashes back again, this time to show us why Dutch and Vicky broke up. Instead we're wondering what he saw in her in the first place. Later on he interrupts the story yet again, from the perspective of a timberwolf, right in the middle of a shootout. The wolf scene makes sense later, but I think it's really there to show off Olson's descriptive flair.<br />  That said, the merits far outweigh the drawbacks.

BAND OF BROTHERS is about the close relationship of the soldiers who volunteered for Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division. It follows them through Normandy, the Arnhem campaign in Holland, The Battle of The Bulge, and the capture of Berchtesgaden, Hitler's Eagle's Nest. I had previously read Ambrose's CITIZEN SOLDIERS, which had enough characters to make a Russian novelist proud. Like a journalist, Ambrose would fully identify a soldier the first time he's mentioned, then assume the reader knows whom he's talking about thereafter. With BAND OF BROTHERS there's more of a focus. Captain Herbert Sobel, the first C.O. of Easy Company gets a lot of attention. Sobel was a training officer, pretty much hated by the men. Lieutenant Richard Winters, who was cool under fire, is the exact opposite. Forty-seven years later he still receives letters from some of the regular troopers. Of the enlisted men, I found Pvt. David Webster the most intriguing. Before the war, he was a Harvard English Lit major. Ambrose uses the book he wrote about his war experience extensively.<br />  An especially interesting part of the book was the part about the troopers' relationships with French, Dutch, Belgium, and German civilians. Their attitude toward the Germans was rather surprising.<br />  Ambrose provides an epilogue where he details what became of the men after the war: An inordinate number of them became teachers or were involved in the construction trade. Several became millionaires. The most tragic case is that of First Sergeant Talbert, who never was able to shake the trauma of war.<br />  If you have as much respect for the soldiers who fought in WWII as I do, you will find BAND OF BROTHERS a compelling read.	2002-04-24

I don't see much of a similarity, other than that MYSTIC RIVER might be considered a noir novel. Lehane is more of a literary writer. Where Hammett's writing is spare, written in objective point of view, Lehane takes you inside the heads of some of the most realistic characters I've encountered in quite some time.<br />  The story starts when Sean Devine, Jimmy Marcus, and Dave Boyle were kids. They were friends, kind of, but Sean was from the Point, whereas Jimmy and Dave were from the Flats. I don't know if this was meant to be Boston or not, but Lehane explains the difference toward the end of the book. The Pen River is named after a penitentiary that was once located there. People who lived in the Flats were descendants of the prisoners; those who lived in The Point were the children of the guards.<br />  Anyway, Dave and Jimmy and Sean get into a fight (Jimmy wants to steal a car and Sean doesn't want to); a car pulls up and some cops get out. They take Dave away. Only, they're not cops.<br />  Twenty-five years later the story picks up when ex-con Jimmy's daughter goes missing. Sean is now a cop (Of course he is, he's from the point). Dave has a hard time holding a job. Jimmy has pretty much gone straight. He runs a corner store (It's described during some of the best exposition I've ever read). Dave becomes a suspect because he's one of the last people to see Jimmy's daughter alive.<br />  MYSTIC RIVER is about so much more than just the aftermath of child abuse. We get inside the head of a murderer, more than one actually, and they're not your typical murderers; they're your everyday people who have trouble holding a job, who fight with their wives, who try to do the right thing. This is one of the best books I've read in the last ten years, right up there with Kent Haruf's PLAINSONG.	2002-04-12

In FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, H.G. Bissinger, an investigative reporter for the Chicago Tribune, sets out to shadow the 1988 team.<br />  The Panthers drew as many as 20,000 fans on a Friday night. But football wasn't Bissinger's only concern. He wanted to examine racial relations, politics, and the effect of a one-industry economy. He wanted to know how sports impacted the educational system. Bissenger goes to every practice, meeting, and game. He goes to school with the players, visits their homes, goes to church with them; he even hunts rattle snakes with them.<br />  In his preface, Bissinger refers to the Friday night games as \\"the Friday night fix.\\" Adults live vicariously through their sons. Bissenger interviewed hundreds of Odessa citizens during the time he lived there, and it seemed the biggest danger was that these boys would have their fifteen minutes of fame on the gridiron and spend the rest of their lives reliving it.<br />  Bissenger introduces us to some unforgettable characters. Boobie Miles dreams of playing for Nebraska or Texas A&M, of winning the Heisman, and his uncle L.V., who had rescued him from a foster home, expects those dreams to bear fruit. But a bad knee made Boobie tentative. Jerrod McDougal is a 5'9\\" offensive tackle with no such dreams, but he loves to play for the Panthers, the Boys in Black. \\"It's like the gladiators,\\" he says. \\"It's like the Christians and the lions . . . . a high no drug or booze or woman can give you.\\" Then there's Gary Gaines, the coach of Permian High. He returns home after losing an important game to find several \\"for sale\\" signs planted on his lawn.<br />  FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is a cautionary tale, warning of the consequences of putting too high an emphasis on high school sports. In some respects, this is a depressing book. There's an epilogue at the end detailing what became of some of the players. Knee scopes, failing grades, and the inability to compete claiming most of the Permian gladiators.ers.

The protagnoist, Michael Tanner, a public relations executive from Seattle, loses his wife and her best friend. The authorities don't take Tanner seriously when he insists his boat was rammed on purpose, and he begins a lonely search for a yacht named Goldenrod.<br />  The strength of INNER PASSAGES is the setting: the waterways along the coast of British Columbia between Vancouver Island and the mainland. Brookins also has more than a layman's knowledge of sailing.<br />  I had problems with motivation. Why would the yacht, whether it was running drugs or whatever, call attention to itself by attacking a civilian boat unaware of its intent? Brookins does take us aboard Goldenrod at times, but he never does address the issue.<br />  The author's penchant for jumping out of third person limited into omniscient point of view also bothered me. On page 82, I was sure I was missing a page. Without white space or anything, Brookins jumps from Tanner's internal monologue to a sailor aboard the Goldenrod. Brookins also doesn't trust the reader. He ruins the climax by telegraphing what's going to happen. Also, for most of the book, Tanner is alone. Whenever that happens, there's a tendency for too much interior monologue, which really slows the pace. Three-quarters of the way in, Michael acquires a lady friend and the story becomes more engrossing.<br />  Mary Whitney and Michael Tanner are likable characters, but it's always dangerous when a human antagonist is missing.	2002-04-05

Ball, son of a minister and former Village Voice columnist, set out to discover his connections to a slave-owning past. What he found was six generations of Balls who owned twenty plantations along the Cooper River near Charleston, South Carolina, masters over more than 4,000 African-Americans.<br />  He finds Elias \\"Red Cap\\" Ball who inherited half of a 740-acre Comingtee Plantation and twenty black and Indian slaves in 1698. Elias had five white children and possibly two by his black housekeeper, Dolly. One of his children tells his heirs in his will to lend money at interest or buy young slaves. Henry Laurens, married to Red Cap's daughter Eleanor, owned the largest slave-trading firm in the colonies. They brought 7,800 Africans to America between 1751 and 1761, earning a hundred and fifty-six thousand pounds in commissions, making him and his wife one of the richest families in America. John Ball, Red Cap's grandson, leaves $227,191 to his heirs as a result of selling his belongings at auction, which included 367 people.<br />  James Poyas, great-grandson of Red Cap, never married but seems to have had a relationship with a field hand named Diana, with whom he had a son, Frederick. Edward Ball finds Frederick's descendants, living in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. Ball also tracks a young slave girl from Sierra Leone to Charleston, where Second Elias Ball bought her, and traces her lineage to Thomas P. Martin, retired assistant school principal and a seventh-generation descendant of Priscilla.<br />  Edward Ball visits Sierra Leone, looking for descendants of slave traders there. Peter Karefa-Smart, a descendant of Gumbo Smart, a middleman for the British, doesn't seem to bothered by what his ancestor did. He says, \\"If there were no buyers, there would be no sellers, but you could turn it around and say, if there were no sellers, there would have been no buyers.\\"<br />  There are a couple of incidents that caught my interest. One was the story of Boston King, who escaped from Tranquil Hill, one of the Ball plantations. In 1792, Boston King and Twelve hundred other escaped slaves boarded ships bound for Sierra Leone, thus coming full circle. Another is the amazing resemblance between the author, Edmund Ball and his William James Ball, the patriarch of the Ball family during the Civil War.

The musicians are professors and instructors at the college. Each of them has a story line. The beautiful Peggy Benoit is taken with alcoholic Connor. She's kind of a groupie, being more enamored of Connor's reputation as an artist than the man. I found Neil Novotny, who plays clarinet, the most interesting character, because he gives Hassler an opportunity to satirize beginning novelists (and I imagine what he remembers about the experience himself). My favorite Hassler book is STAGGERFORD in which Hassler satirizes the political and personal machinations that occur in a high school setting. As a twenty-year teacher, I found those more interesting than the story line.<br />I also had fun trying to pick out any similarities to the two colleges Hassler taught at: Brainerd Community College and St. John's (just outside St. Cloud, Minnesota). There's an ice fishing scene which seems to point at the little lake right next to St. John's. The other character I found intriguing was Victor Dash, the faculty union representative. Most of the teachers involved find labor negotiations beneath themselves; Dash revels in the matter, would like nothing better than to strike.<br />Hassler is a Dickensesque writer, totally immersing us in this academic setting. Major characters and minor characters are given the same careful attention to detail. You can't lose with ROOKERY BLUES.	2002-04-02

He's the father of Barbaraannette Quinn, who wins the lottery and decides to spend a million of it trying to win her husband Bobby back. He absconded six years before and she's never gotten over the good-looking devil.<br />  Bobby, along with his girlfriend, Phlox, sees her offer on TV. They decide to claim the reward and then split, which strains credulity because people are looking for Bobby in Cold Rock, Minnesota. You see, before he left, he conned these two guys out of money to start a dude ranch, and he runs into them as soon as he sets foot in Cold Rock. Suddenly everybody wants the million dollars and Bobby changes hands more often than the Hope diamond.<br />There are a lot of quirky characters in MRS. MILLION, but probably the most interesting one is the college professor, Andre Gideon, who just happens to be in the right place (or wrong, depending upon how you look at it). He's more interested in JJ Morrow, another con man, who sends letters to celebrities to mooch money off of them. Gideon is unique because Hautman is working against type. Gideon looks about as violent as Shirley Temple, but he's got a mean streak as long as the English Chunnel.<br />  There's a lot of internal monologue in this novel, which slows down the pace, but it speeds up when Barbaraanette collects the million in cash from her marathon-running banker, who just happens to have loved her forever. The funniest part is how often the money changes hands. You'll start counting heads when the money disappears. Everybody seems to be accounted for.<br />The eventual resolution is sidesplitting.	2002-03-30

I look forward to the next Jim Chee/Joe Leaphorn novel like a five-year old looks forward to Christmas. Jim Chee is studying to be a shaman, and in the early novels, LISTENING WOMAN, THE SKINWALKERS, we get to look over his shoulders and learn about the various Navajo rituals, the most interesting of which is the skinwalker ceremony. You see, the Navajo believe in ghosts. They believe that the living can be inhabited by the spirit of the dead. Many of the old timers go so far as to burn down their hogans when there's a death. Logically then, according to a Navajo, anyone who, say, commits a murder or molests a child must have been inhabited by this evil spirit, hence the name skinwalkers.<br />  Almost as interesting as the rituals is the vast scope of the reservation. In THE FALLEN MAN a man has been murdered on sacred Ship Rock, seventeen hundred feet above the desert floor. To make matters worse, he isn't found for another eleven years.<br />  Joe Leaphorn, newly retired and at a loss for something to occupy his time, connects the skeletal bones to another murder, that of an old canyon guide, shot down by a sniper. Jim Chee, an acting lieutenant in this one, has a father/son relationship with Leaphorn. Chee wants to look good in Leaphorn's eyes, but he always seems to mess up somehow. Leaphorn is Charlie Chan to Chee's Number One Son. Leaphorn is taciturn, Chee more volatile. Leaphorn mourns his dead wife; Chee has more woman trouble than a gynecologist.<br />  I know Tony Hillerman is getting older (he's in his seventies now, I guess), but I wish he'd find a little bit more time to write. I've been reduced to reading some of the Hillerman clones and they just don't measure up.	2002-03-28

He witnesses Klan rallies; journeys to Andersonville, the Confederate prison camp; interviews the great Civil War historian Shelby Foote; but by far the most interesting people he meets are the reenactors. Horwitz travels from Antietam to Gettysburg in the company of Robert Lee Hodge, a real \\"hardcore\\" who insists on drinking out of a tin cup, eating hard tack and salt pork, wearing homespun clothing, speaking in authentic nineteenth century diction, and maintaining a starvation diet. On the battlefied, Hodge would \\"do the bloat,\\" swelling his belly, curling his hands, puffing out his cheeks, in imitation of the bloated corpses found in Matthew Brady photographs.<br />Horwitz visits Confederate museums, where he finds a torch used by Sherman's men, a carpetbagger's suitcase, a handwritten list of South Carolians killed in the war, a bestseller in Columbian bookstores.<br />Horwitz even visits a bar that celebrated Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday with a \\"Thank God for James Earl Ray Party.\\" He also tells us about Michael Westerman, who drove through Guthrie, Kentucky, flying a rebel flag. Carloads of black young men ran him to ground, one of whom shot Guthrie dead.<br />This book is frightening, informative, and funny in spots. If you're looking for something different, CONFEDERATES IN THE ATTIC is a great choice.	2002-03-22

The city becomes a character in the novels. He shows us the Cathedral, the Mississippi and its caves, the beautiful homes on Summit Ave. He takes us back to the depression when gangsters, such as Dillenger and the Barker gang, were given free reign in the city.<br />  In The WHEAT FIELD, Thayer moves the setting to the Wisconsin Dells, Kickapoo county. Again he uses the history of the Dells to provide texture for his novel. He mentions Joe McCarthy, who supposedly belonged to the gun club mentioned in the story, and Ed Gein, the murderous ghoul, who dug up corpses in the local graveyard and used their skin to upholster his furniture.<br />  I had high hopes for this novel. It takes guts to make your main character a voyeur, and just a few pages in there's a lurid sex scene. Most of the writing books tell you to make your protagonist a likable character; and who likes peeping Toms? Just a bit on the plot. Two people are murdered in this wheat field in the midst of what looks like a crop circle. They're high school friends of Pliny Pennington, the deputy in charge of the murder investigation. He's in love with the female victim, Maggie Butler. We soon discover that two more of Pennington's high school friends, a senatorial candidate and his wife, were also involved. The evidence points towards a \\"snuff\\" film.<br />  We don't really get to know any of these people, other than Pliny. Once more, those pesky book doctors insist that in a thriller there be less of an emphasis on character development, ignoring the danger that the reader just might not care what happens to these people. I also had a hard time with Thayer's choppy writing style. Very short sentences, even during those times when nothing much is happening. There's also implausibility galore. At the end, the setting shifts to Nantucket where we meet a ghost and a bunch of CIA types with a connection to the impending Kennedy assassination.

Andrews incest theme. However, because I was raised on a farm and because I recognized the King Lear allusions, I did enjoy it as a whole. I was willing to give Smiley another go when I came across HORSE HEAVEN. It doesn't hurt that I'm a horse racing fanatic.<br />  This is a Michener-like novel with something like a dozen story lines, with trainers and gamblers and jockeys and sports writers and touts interacting before, during, and after the races. If you watch any horse racing, you'll recognize the billionaire owner and his trophy wife Rosalind Maybrick, who has a requisite affair with one of the trainers. There's the successful trainer, Buddy, who uses underhanded means, and the unsuccessful trainer, Farley, who plays by the book. There's Roberto, the jockey, who's putting on weight. There's Leo, the gambler, and his son Jesse, who's more adult than his father. And there are the horses. Justa Bob will remind you of Seabiscuit. He passes from owner to owner, spiraling down from the winner's circle to an also ran. The fractious Epic Stream is a fictional War Admiral, who had a habit of biting his jockey.<br />  Mixed in with the fictional are the factual elements. Real horses like Silver Charm, Skip Away, Real Quiet and silverbulletday and the big time races that aim toward the Triple Crown and culminate with The Breeders Cup.<br />  Horse Heaven was five hundred and sixty-one pages of equine fun.	2002-03-18

These two boys try to rape Davy Land's girlfriend during a football game, but Jeremiah Land, the school janitor interrupts, flogging them with a broomstick handle. They retaliate, Davy retaliates. There's a home invasion. Davy shoots them dead, one of them execution style.<br />  At first I didn't think Davy had enough motivation to do what he did. Sure, the boys kidnapped his little sister, but they didn't hurt her much, and when they show up in his bedroom, they're armed with only a baseball bat. There also isn't much exposition involving the two boys. We don't learn to hate them. We never develop a \\"They got what they deserved\\" sympathy for Davy.<br />  But that's the point. Enger makes sure we know that Davy did something unforgivable, that he will be an outsider for the rest of his life. And beyond?<br />  A couple of characters in PEACE LIKE A RIVER are unforgettable. Swede Land, the little sister, and very late in the story, Jape Waltzer. Enger loves Robert Service poety, Robert Lewis Stevenson, Zane Gray, and western folk lore. As a result he imbues little Swede with poetic talent. Throughout the story, she's writing an epic poem about this outlaw named Sundown. After awhile, this gets a little old and the poems aren't as good, but she's hard not to love. Jape Waltzer, although he provides a refuge for Davy, is hard to like. I think he's supposed to be the devil. Which leads to the mystical aspect of the story. Jeremiah Land, the janitor, has the power to heal. He even heals the superintendent of schools of facial lesions after he fires him. But he doesn't heal his son, Reuben the narrator, of chronic asthma, and we're kept wondering why until the end.<br />  The middle of the story is slow, really slow. I kept falling asleep. The family sets out to find Davy when he escapes from jail. They travel in an Airstream trailer. An FBI agent trails along behind. They don't have any gas, but that's not a problem with Jeremiah around. The story picks up speed when we meet Davy again and Waltzer. Enger must have had a really good editor. He hardly tells us a thing about how Waltzer and Davy met. Our imaginations take over. The guy has funny eyebrows; he's missing two fingers on one hand. He's meaner'n sin.<br />  There's another slow scene toward the end, after some fireworks, where Enger gets carried away showing off his lyrical writing style in a resurrection scene. I'd be willing to bet he's got a copy of LIFE AFTER LIFE, by Dr. Raymond Moody on his desk somewhere.<br />  Some of this is awfully corny, but well worth your time if you appreciate solid characterization and some nifty description.remiah around.

Thayer really knows depression-era St. Paul, Minnesota: the river caves, the trolley cars, the gangsters. There's a quote from Alvin &quot;Creepy&quot; Karpis before Book One. &quot;But, of all the Midwest cities, the one that I knew best was St. Paul, and it was a crook's haven...&quot;<br />  The lead character, Grover Mudd, WWI veteran and reporter for the St. Paul Frontier News, has that FRONT PAGE kind of newspaper-reporter angst. He smokes Lucky Strikes, drinks Stearns County 13, refers to his ex-wife as that &quot;lousy bitch&quot;. There's lots of Minnesota flavor in the book: St. Paul Cathedral, South St. Paul stockyards, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Floyd B. Olson, Cass Gilbert, and the beginnings of 3M, a small sandpaper company.<br />  Two little boys are murdered, hog-tied at the ankles, one a mongoloid, their bodies in the water for a week before being discovered, one with broken legs, and Grover sets out to find the sick-o who did it. Fourteen unsolved murders in the last eighteen months. Twenty-four police chiefs in the last twenty-one years and they can't be fired, only demoted. Along the way, Grover falls in love again, with a colored maid. With Grover's penchant for trouble, you'll worry about her. Although I loved Grover and would just about excuse anything Thayer does because of him, some of the characters, such as Big Holy Spook and Gunderson the cop, are a bit over the top.	2002-03-12

He can draw the reader into a story almost as well as Stephen King. His characterization is on a par with John Irving. But--and this is a big but--you can also bet he'll go overboard sooner or later.<br />  In THE EMPTY CHAIR, a sequel to THE BONE COLLECTOR, I was routing all the way: &quot;Come on, Jeff; you can do it. You can make it all the way. There's no reason for you to blow it this time!&quot;<br />  He blew it. Three-quarters of the way he went David E. Kelley on me (You know, the outrageous producer/writer of Allie McBeal and Boston Public). This time the entire police force in Tanner's Corner, North Carolina, goes over to the dark side.<br />  That said, I'd still recommend any Deaver novel with Lincoln Rhyme as the main character. This forensic detective is paralyzed from the neck down. He can move the tip of one finger, but he gets around more than Henry Kissenger. In THE BONE COLLECTOR, he was suicidal. In this one, he's goes to the University of North Carolina to undergo experimental surgery. While there, he and his beautiful protegee, Amelia Sachs, are confronted with a gripping kidnapping of two young girls. The main suspect is a young man called the Insect Boy, so named because of his fascination with bugs. The intuitive Amelia thinks he's innocent. Deaver propels the story forward to the wild twist concerning the police department, during which time I found myself saying, &quot;Come on now, Jeff. Is your editor out to lunch?&quot;<br />  All I can say is in the next Lincoln Rhymes I fully expect old Lincoln to be walking around again as if he's just been to Lourdes and caught the cure.

In the face of one reviewer's contention that Evanovich appeals to both men and women, I looked at about half of the Amazon five-star reviews and most of them came from women. So then, what could a supposedly objective male reader find in Evanovich? I was intrigued by the female bounty hunter. I also liked Evanovich's facility with repartee. She knows where her talent lies and there's a heavy emphasis on dialogue. The main character is also likable and self-deprecating. One can't help but think Kinsey Millhone.<br />  But outside of the witty dialogue I don't find Evanovich all that humorous.This is an example of Evanovich humor: \\"Vinnie (Stephanie's bail bondsman boss and cousin) was 5'7\\", looked like a weasel, thought like a weasel, smelled like a French whore and was once in love with a duck.\\" The supposedly funny situations revolve around Stephanie's relationship with Vinnie; her co-worker Lula, a reformed prostitute; 73-year-old Grandma Mazur; and love interest, Joe Morelli. You can find most of these people on TV every night under various aliases.<br />  One would also expect a bounty hunter to have a bit more of a hard edge. But no, Stephanie is sugar and spice and everything nice; she's preoccupied with winding up in the sack with Morelli, Grandma's home cooking, and how she's going to find transportation after totaling another car.<br />  Joyce Barnhardt, who competes with Stephanie for jobs, does offer a kind of Professor Moriarty foil, but a good villain needs to be as smart as the hero and Joyce is mostly there to provide the potential for a titillating cat fight.<br />  Like many of the other reviewers, I started rather late in the series; I suppose because that was the one offered by Literary Guild.

This first-person account by a Vietnam veteran hooks the reader with a funny golden retriever who loves what makes him sick (Think about it). The narrator is a part-time college student, taking one free class a session in partial payment for his job as a security guard. He figures it'll take him sixteen years to graduate.<br />  The story is heavily laced with irony in that the student tests the teacher. The narrator (I couldn't find a name) turns in a paper entitled \\"Ralph the Duck\\", which seems entirely inappropriate for an assignment in rhetoric and persuasion (You'll need to read the story several times before you figure out why he felt it met the assignment).<br />  We've all met teachers like the professor. He never wears a suit. He sports khakis and sweaters, loafers or sneakers. Ironed dungarees.<br />  There's lots of sardonic humor. The narrator says, \\"Slick characters like my professor like it if you're a killer or at least a onetime middleweight fighter.\\"<br />  The story picks up pace when a red-headed co-ed takes some pills during a snowstorm and disappears, and our hero is off to the rescue. The redhead is the professor's \\"advisee\\".<br />  Although the story is twenty pages long, it is very sparely written. As I was reading it, I thought to myself, \\"This would make a really good novel.\\" Apparently Busch did, too. It's called GIRLS. If you can't figure out \\"Ralph the Duck\\", read the novel.	2002-03-06

I know I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't received it for Christmas. Sylvia Nasar also spends an inordinate amount of time telling the reader how movie-star handsome and how powerfully built John Nash was. ... There are lots of pictures; let the reader decide.<br /> As I was reading this book, I kept thinking of Richard Wagner. Wagner was certainly a musical genius, but supposedly left a lot to be desired as a human being. Most people would excuse Wagner, though, because he was an undeniable genius. John Nash was supposedly a mathematical genius. He won the Nobel prize in economics for something called game theory. He was not a very nice man. He seduces a young woman, has a child with her, then refuses to marry her or support their son. He's conceited, a lackluster teacher, and a closet homosexual. But then just as he approaches thirty, he contracts schizophrenia. He's sent to sanitariums, undergoes insulin shock therapy, has a short remission and then a relapse that lasts something like thirty years. The suspense lies in the fact that Nash was somehow able to cure himself and the reader wants to know how he went about doing that. Paranoid schizophrenia is supposed to be an incurable disease, after all. Nasar does a credible job disputing that. She cites studies that peg the number at something like eight percent who were eventually cured.<br /> Nasar is a former economics correspondent for The New York Times, but she's no Carl Sagen or Machio Kaku or even Stephen Hawking. They manage to make their arcane topics palatable to laymen. A BEAUTIFUL MIND, on the other hand, is littered with algebraic formulae that make about as much sense as Egyptian hieroglyphics. The reader also has no idea how game theory applies to economics until Nasar finally gets around to it in Chapter 49: \\"...in the world of megamergers, big government, massive foreign direct investment, and wholesale privatization, where the game is played by a handful of players, each taking into account the others' actions, each pursuing his own best strategies, game theory has come to the fore.\\" She then goes on to illustrate how this works, as Al Gore auctions off airwaves for new wireless gadgets. Supposedly, without Nash's theory, the auction would have resulted in utter chaos.<br /> We also get an intriguing look inside the selection process for the Nobel prize, not at all as civilized as one might expect.ct investment, and wholesale privatization, where the game is played by a handful of players, each taking into account the others' actions, each pursuing his own best strategies, game theory has come to the fore.\\" She then goes on to illustrate how this works, as Al Gore auctions off airwaves for new wireless gadgets.

He shot the one next to Bernard trying to get up, caught between the wall and the plywood table. He shot the one in the chair tilted against the wall. And shot the one by the back hall as this one brought a machete out of his belt and shot him again as the blade showed a glint of light from the open door.\\"<br />  The preceding is a surprising early twist in Leonard's rather unconventional novel PAGAN BABIES. Murder scenes aren't too unusual in Leonard's novels, but they are when the shooter is a Catholic priest (Or is he?) Leonard's novel begins in Rawanda, where Father Terry Dunn's church has become a tomb for \\"forty-seven bodies turned to leather and stains.\\" None of his parishioners will enter the church, so Father Terry hears confessions in the yard of the rectory. This is where Bernard confesses his plans to kill more people.<br />  Father Terry is living in sin with his one-armed housekeeper, Chantelle Nyamwase. He's given up saying mass for the most part. He drinks a lot of Johnny Walker Red. Now, is this a case of priestly angst or is something else going on here? Leonard keeps the reader guessing well into the book.<br />  Terry escapes to Detroit, where he hooks up with Debbie Dewey, stand-up-comic in training, who's just done three years in prison for running over her ex-husband with a Buick Riviera. She wants the $67,000 he conned her out of, plus interest. By now, we know that Father Terry has a colorful background as well, smuggling tax-free cigarettes, but ostensibly, his half of the con will go to the Rwandan children.<br />  I found the Rwanda scenes totally engrossing. Leonard has the African accent down pat: \\"Bless me, Fatha, for I have sin. Is a long time since I come here but is not my fault, you don't have Confession always when you say.\\" Chantelle is a compelling character as are the other Africans. It's when we get back to Detroit that Leonard reverts to form, with his cons conning cons motif. Debbie Dewey's stand-up routine also adds a certain quirky charm. Look for another jolting twist at the end.that Leonard reverts to form, with his cons conning cons motif. Debbie Dewey's stand-up routine also adds a certain quirky charm.

In order to live it he had to write it. This book was written for much the same reason.&quot;<br />  Shaara uses shifting viewpoints to introduce us to some of the more well-known characters, to take us inside their heads. There's Lee, of course, and James Longstreet, who'd disapproved of the invasion of the North. George Pickett, George Meade, Winfield Scott Hancock, they're all here, but Shaara also takes the time to focus on the lesser knowns, such as General John Buford, who chose the high ground on which the battle was to be fought and the most compelling character, Colonel Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain. A professor of rhetoric prior to the war, he seems the least likely hero, but at Little Roundtop, with his troops about to be overrun by Longstreet's troops, he directs his troops to &quot;Fix bayonets&quot; and orders a right wheel forward of the whole regiment, routing the confederates.<br />  Another engaging story is that of Confederate General Lewis Armistead, whose friendship with Union General Winfield Scott Hancock is dramatized when Armistead dies during Pickett's charge.<br />  Shaara's ending ties a neat ribbon on things as it lists all of the surviving characters and what became of them after the battle. Ironically, Chamberlain dies of his wounds. At the age of eighty-three.<br />  You can't go wrong with this one; it's the best book on Gettysburg I've read, fiction or nonfiction.	2002-02-21

Let me illustrate, using HEARTS IN ATLANTIS as a guide.<br />  HEARTS In ATLANTIS is really a bunch of novelettes and short stories. The first one is traditional Stephen King. A young kid, Bobby Garfield, gets a job reading to this kindly (and strange) old man, who's being pursued by \\"Low Men in Yellow Coats\\". Cool-sounding I'll admit, but really only more of the same clown staring up out of a sewer grate.<br />  The second one, HEARTS IN ATLANTIS, is more like it. It's about a bunch of college kids sitting around their dorm rooms playing Hearts. They're playing for blood. They skip class, they're flunking out of school, which wouldn't be all that bad if it weren't for Vietnam and the draft. This one is written in the vein of King's best book, MISERY, which had a valid theme (Obsessive fans with no taste) and finger-biting suspense (plausible finger-biting suspense). But King just doesn't trust himself. He doesn't believe the card game story can stand on its own and his editor hasn't got the balls to tell him he doesn't need all that other garbage. Remember THE STAND? An early editor actually made him cut a couple hundred pages of that one. So what does King do? When he gets the clout, he puts the padding back and publishes the thing again (Unfortunately this was the one I had the misfortune to read).<br />  There's a scene toward the end of HEARTS where things start falling out of the sky. If you're reading one of King's books, you can count on one of these sooner or later: \\"A vast rummage sale was falling out of the sky: tape recorders and rugs and a riding lawn-mower with the grass-caked blade whirling in its housing and a black lawn-jockey and an aquarium with the fish still swimming in it . . .\\" It goes on for another page. I'm a compulsive sort. I can't skip over anything, including footnotes, but I almost stopped reading after that.<br />  Don't get me wrong. I think Stephen King is a great short story writer. Even some of his horror stories are great. I remember one from SKELETON CREW where these people are trapped in a supermarket surrounded by giant bugs. Not exactly Edgar Allen Poe, but it was fun. SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and STAND BY ME were based on his short stories and they were two of his most successful movies. No, King isn't out of ideas; he's just out of clown-down-the-grate ideas. And those were stale after he wrote TOMMYKNOCKERS. IT's time to go straight, Steve. I was hoping you would after MISERY.r. Even some of his horror stories are great.

Seventy-three-year-old Axel Speeter runs a taco concession stand at the Minnesota State Fair. Tommy Fabian, who stands 62\\"in cowboy boots and stetson hat, has a license to print money at Tiny Tot Donuts. Axel's former poker-playing buddy and expert mechanic Sam O'Gara also makes an appearance (He's Joe Crow's dad. Joe is Pete Hautman's reluctant detective in most of his books).<br />  The set-up is this: Axel doesn't trust banks; he's got $260,000 stashed in coffee cans at the Motel 6 where he lives. Sam has hired his girlfriend Sophie Roman's daughter Carmen to work at his confession stand. She detests the place; she's also dating a skinhead named James Dean, who wants to relieve Axel of his money, but not before he tries to mug Tommy Fabian. If you've ever watched midget wrestling you have a pretty good idea of what a one-sided proposition that was. Tommy refers to James Dean as that \\"bald monkey\\".<br />  The Minnesota State Fair is definitely the star vehicle here. Hautman has O'Gara pinch hit for Tommy at one point doing which time he says, \\"Gotta get myself a joint like this, sell deep-fried lutefisk on a stick or some goddamn thing.\\" Sam also owns a pair of vicious dogs named Chester and Festus who're almost as funny as Sam.<br />  Some critics compare Pete Hautman to Carl Hiaasen. I'll admit I've only read one of Hiaasen's books and I may be prejudiced because of all the Minnesota references, but I'd say Hautman is Charlie Chaplin to Hiaasen's Pinky Lee.	2002-02-15

In 1904, he struck out 345 batters, during a time when hitters choked up on the bat, just trying to make contact with two strikes. Rube was also the first great drawing card. Because of him, new stadiums were built in Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Boston. Levy says, \\"He was among the game's first real drawing cards, among its first honest-to-goodness celebrities, and the first player to have teams of newspaper reporters following him, and the first to have a mass following of idol-worshiping kids yelling out his nickname like he was their buddy.\\"<br />  Rube was also one of the game's all-time greatest \\"characters\\". He would call his infielders into the dugout and strike out the side. He would do handstands and cartwheels after a victory. He would make animal noises while pitching. Unfortunately, he would also get into bar fights, drink too much, and disappear on a whim.<br />  Eventually, Rube's manager, Connie Mack, got tired of Rube's unreliability and shipped him off to the St. Louis Browns, where he lasted two mores years before being banished to the minors. He pitched for the Minneapolis Millers for two years after that, hoping to be noticed by a major league team. It never happened.<br />The Millers trained in Hickman, Kentucky, which was plagued by floods. Always the fireman, Rube pitched in, sandbagging alongside black laborers (Quite the no-no in those days). He contracted pneumonia and was told to move to a warmer climate. Dropped by the Millers, Rube played for a team in Virginia, Minnesota, his skills increasingly abandoning him. Rube refused to take care of himself and he eventually would up being arrested as a vagrant in St. Louis and was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He spent his last days in a sanitarium in Texas, his weight dropping to a hundred pounds. When some major leaguers who were in Texas for spring training came to see him he said, \\"I'll be over tomorrow and show you bums how to run. May weight is down to fighting trim now. I'm in shape.\\"<br />  Rube was married three times, during a time when divorce was almost unheard of, his last spouse leaving him because, \\"Rube's just too crazy.\\"<br />  Alan H. Levy is a history professor at Slippery Rock. I think he relied too much on newspaper accounts and not enough on interviews (albeit they're hard to find after almost a hundred years). He does quote from Connie Mack and Mugsy McGraw's biographies, but none of these characters really come to life, not even Rube. Rube's three wives are practically invisible.

Richard Whalen's is the second book I've read about this dispute, and I'm convinced that Edward de Vere was the real Shakespeare. The reasons are legion. Shakespeare's will is awfully suspect; the man was barely literate. He left his second best bed to his wife. Then there's de Vere's Bible with underlined passages that fit the various plays almost word-for-word.<br />  De Vere's own life parallels the happenings in the plays. Lord Burgley was de Vere's guardian and he fits the Polonius character in Hamlet like the proverbial glove. The author of the SONNETS also dedicates them to the Earl of Southampton, with whom de Vere had a (homosexual?) relationship. De Vere spent sixteen months in France and Italy, where many of the plays were set. De Vere was once injured in a street fight. Remind you of anything? De Vere was also a lawyer. There's lots of legal jargon in the plays. De Vere was a soldier. Any battle scenes in Shakespeare?<br />  Whalen also states that the First Folio was dedicated to de Vere's son- in-law. To top it off, de Vere was a playwright and once used Shake-spear as a pen name.<br />  What of the fact that de Vere died in 1604? Whalen counters with the contention that Shakespeare's greatest output occurred between the years 1593-1604, most of them published anonymously and that when Shakespeare of Avon died, nobody seemed to notice.<br />Perhaps because they knew the real one was already dead?<br />  If there's anything to complain about here, it's that the book is too short. There's a longer one on the topic I plan to buy, when I save up enough money.	2002-02-14

The ALIENIST begins with Theodore Roosevelt's funeral, a reason for the novel's narrator, John Schuyler Moore, a New York Times crime reporter, to flash back to 1896, when Roosevelt had just been appointed police commissioner. Roosevelt summons Moore and Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, the alienist of the title, to head up a murder investigation. Someone has been murdering transvestite boy prostitutes and Roosevelt doesn't trust his corrupt police department to solve the crimes.<br /> I had recently read a non-fiction account of life in New York during the nineteenth century and I wanted to see how Carr would<br />incorporate what I knew into a novel. I've also been interested in profiling ever since I read THE RED DRAGON, by Thomas Harris.<br />Kreizler is an early version of a profiler.<br /> Although some reviewers bemoan Carr's handling of minor characters, I found some of them totally engrossing, especially Stevie, a street urchin whom Dr. Kreizler takes under his wing as a driver. Stevie adds some comic relief to a sometimes depressing novel.<br /> Something else I rather liked was the inclusion of historical characters, besides Roosevelt. Jacob Riis and J.P. Morgan, among others, make appearances. You can certainly tell Carr was once a historian. New York City, 1896 is the real star of the story. I've started Carr's futurist novel, KILLING TIME, since I read this one and could not get through the first twenty pages. Stick to history, Caleb.	2002-02-11

Dr. Haggard falls in love with his pathologist's wife, Fanny. She dumps him. There's an assault; Dr. Haggard falls down a stairs, breaking his hip. Throughout the book, he refers to this ailment as Spike. He takes morphine, tries to kick it, can't. He's fired after the \\"accident\\" and goes to live in the south of England at a house called Elgin, where he treats a retirement community. But then Fanny's son, a WWII Spitfire pilot comes to see him. He's found out about his mother's affair and wants to know more about Haggard. That's when the book really really gets strange. Haggerd turns his obsession on James and we're wondering whether Haggerd's disease is his obsession with Fanny or insanity. James finally shuns the doctor, worried that there may be some homosexual interest. But that's not the doctor's take. He's worried the boy may have a disease, a disease that will remind you of THE CRYING GAME. Of course, we're not sure what's happening to James is really occurring because of the unreliability of the narrator. I read the novel because I wanted to see how McGrath handled the unusual point of view, but I wouldn't recommend it for the beach.	2002-02-08

It is chock full of quirky characters and different settings and zigzags back and forth between 1913 and 1987.<br />  The baby girl of the title is Dena Nordstrom, a talk show host who's developing an ulcer, mainly because of the increasing sensationalism of network news programs. Eventually, because of the ulcer and Dr. Michael Debakey, of all people, she winds up recuperating with her cousins in Elmwood Springs, Missouri.<br />  But there's more to the ulcer than qualms about tabloid journalism. Dena's doctor sends her to a psychiatrist and we gradually find that she was deserted by her mother as a young girl. And we begin our search to find her. This part of the book becomes a bit melodramatic. The overly earnest tone will bother some. When you get to the climax, you'll be asking yourself, \\"Is that all there is?\\"<br />  There's also a love story. Dena's psychiatrist falls in love with her; she thinks he's dull, but he grows on her, singing Gershwin and wearing a troubadour suit . You will fall in love with Elmwood Springs, Missouri, especially with Neighbor Dorothy and her radio show. We meet Neighbor Dorothy and her singing canary birds, Dumpling and Moe, in 1948, and although she's dead at the end of the book, her spirit lives. You can still smell her chocolate cake in her kitchen.<br />  Another interesting character is Sarah Jane Krackenberry or Sookie, Dena's sorority sister, who lives in Selma, Alabama.

Did you know Millay wrote it when she was only twenty? Milford includes other interesting little tidbits, as well as a detailed analysis of the woman who burned her candle at both ends. Yes, she died young, a drug addict and an alcoholic. Milford also includes her affairs with men and women, her problems with money, and her health problems, but I found the family relationships most interesting (Lots of pictures).<br /> Millay's mother kicked her feckless husband out of the house, as did her grandmother (who was killed by a runaway horse)hers; all three of the Millay sisters were poets (Norma, the least ambitious of the three, writes a sonnet to rival Edna's best towards the end of the book). The youngest sister, Kathleen, was a sad case. Although she published a couple of novels and several books of poetry, she was jealous of Edna, hounded her for money, and did her level best to embarrass her in print. Millay's mother was the true inspiration for Edna. She read the girls poetry, wrote some of her own (publishing toward the end of her life). She validates B.F. Skinner's theory on parental inspiration and Edna gave her credit.<br /> We also see the writer as performance artist. Edna wins a contest and is invited to read for literary societies in her home town, during which time she wins the support of a woman who sponsors her application to Vassar. According to Milford, Millay was an electrifying reader and became famous largely because of her book tours. She even did radio during a time when poetry was given its due.<br /> Millay also wrote plays and even a book for an opera, all of which did well. She was a true Renascence woman.	2002-02-02

I think it's because Scudder is constantly on the move, giving us a good sense of what Manhattan and the five boroughs are like. Bernie the burglar is more absorbed by his book store and the next apartment he plans to burgle.<br />  Also, the cast of characters in the burglar novels aren't as entertaining. I really like T.J., Scudder's street-wise protege with the computer expertise. The interplay between the two is hilarious. Then there's Elaine, his wife and erstwhile high-class prostitute.<br />  What Block does best is make the reader empathize with outlaw characters. Scudder himself is a former alcoholic. His friend Mick is a murderer. He does this by giving Mick romantic qualities, such as the fact that he attends the butcher's mass every morning. No, this isn't meant to be irony. Mick's father was a butcher and Mick does this to show his father respect. Scudder and Mick have after hour philosophical discussions at Mick's bar, Scudder drinking coffee, Mick the hair of the dog.<br />  HOPE TO DIE is about the murder of Byrne and Susan Hollander. Scudder and Elaine were at a social function with them on the night they died. The killers turn up dead a few days later. Murder, suicide? Scudder doesn't think so. As stories go, this one isn't much, but as he investigates, Scudder's past returns to haunt him. His ex-wife Anita dies, Mike and Andy's mother, whom Scudder abandoned when they were kids. So then, the `B' story becomes Andy's need for money. Scudder must decide whether to bail the boy out and contribute to his irresponsibility or to let him come to grips on his own. But will his conscience let him do that?<br />  Back to the Hollander story. They're not the last to die. This murderer should be easy to catch. He has a fascination with the initials \\"A.B.\\". The ending may cause some readers to throw the book up against the wall, but I personally think it makes the story more realistic. This isn't television. Sometimes the detective doesn't get his man.

US	52809057	R3BTTDBJFOZS1O	0375502912	678550726	Seabiscuit: An American Legend	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Inspirational	My first experience with horse racing was when Nashua won the Preakness and the Belmont in 1955. He finished second to Swaps in the Kentucky Derby. As I recall, he was a beautiful, black stallion who looked like something out of the Arabian nights. I've loved horse racing ever since, although I'm too chicken to place a bet.<br />  And so I decided to read Laura Hillenbrand's SEABISCUIT. I'd heard of the horse before, but I hadn't known he was a grandson of Man o' War. I had known, however, that War Admiral, Seabisbuit's nemesis, was Man o' War's son. I also didn't know that Seabiscuit was almost overlooked. \\"He was a rough-hewn, undersized horse with a sad little tail and knees that wouldn't straighten all the way. He lost his first sixteen races. Sonny Jim Fitzsimmons, his first trainer, thought the talent was there but that Seabiscuit was lazy. But that didn't stop him from racing the little horse thirty-five times as a two-year-old.<br />  Three men salvaged Seabiscuit's career. Red Pollard, his jockey, who'd been sleeping in a stall. Tom Smith, the trainer known as \\"The Lone Plainsman\\", and Charles Howard, his owner, who introduced the automobile to the West. Ultimately, in the year 1938, Seabiscuit received more newspaper coverage than FDR or Hitler.<br />  The story builds to a match race between Seabiscuit and War Admiral, who won the triple crown, but the true merit of the book is the inspiration this little animal provides. Nobody's ever really down and out. It's never too late. I also loved the little sidelights Hillenbrand reveals about racing. How Pollard won Seabiscuit's affection with a sugar cube, how all sorts of animals from German shepherds to three-legged cats were used as stablemates for horses, what a hard-scrabble existence jockeys lived during the Depression. Hillenbrand's been writing about thoroughbred racing since 1988. She really, really knows her stuff.	2002-01-31

Think Barbara Stanwyck, who starred in the movie version. One of Woolrich's other stories eventually became REAR WINDOW.<br />  The pacing in the novel is remarkable. At first it almost stops as the girl stands in front of a door and later listens to the dial tone as she tries to reach her lover who has left her pregnant and alone. But then it picks up as the girl heads west on a train, meets a newlywed and her new husband who show her compassion. The train crashes and somehow the two switch places and the girl is summoned back east where she becomes Patrice, the rich girl.<br />  I was also impressed by Woolrich's pronoun usage. He refers to the girl as &quot;she&quot;, although she does have a name, Helen. He begins several sentences in a row with the word &quot;she&quot;, doesn't worry about varying his paragraph beginnings. Yet, this doesn't bother the reader a bit. Later on when she switches places with the rich girl, she becomes Patrice, so I imagine Woolrich is saying something about social class.<br />  The setting, The Great Depression, adds a lot to the story. When she dials her lover, the girl asks the operator for her nickel back because it's the only money she has. Her former lover does leave her five dollars, along with railroad tickets, but when she boards the train, she's left with only seventeen cents, which she keeps throughout the novel.<br />  I was bothered by the beginning which, in effect, told us how the novel would end. I imagine this was supposed to add suspense, but all it did for me was tell me Patrice and Bill would eventually hook up. Also, that despicable heal Georgesson giving Helen five dollars didn't quite ring true, and I was wondering why he would travel thousands of miles to identify Helen's body when he obviously couldn't care less what happened to her. I can only surmise that Woolrich needed Georgesson to give her the railroad tickets as a plot device (which should be hidden).<br />  The ending will also rattle some cages as the reader must furnish her own. You'll read it over several times, I can guarantee you.ice (which should be hidden). <BR>   The ending will also rattle some cages as the reader must furnish her own.

I was a teacher for twenty years, and, believe me, there are very few administrators like Dr. Olson.<br />  The set-up is this: Journalist Elinor Burkett was to be given almost unlimited access to students, teachers, administrators and parents for an entire year. She was looking for a suburban school about the size of Columbine and Prior Lake fit the bill.<br />  I have to say that I enjoyed the book, especially the kids. Burkett includes a &quot;Cast of Characters&quot; within the first few pages. The inside covers are also used as a photo gallery. I kept paging back to find whomever she was talking about at a given time. Another remarkable fact: she used real names, had everybody sign a release before she'd talk to them.<br />  Many of the kids fit specific &quot;types&quot; we've all met when we were in high school: Tony Lorenz, the cocky co-captain of the football team; Ashlee Altenbach, the pot-smoking ADHD student; Marissa Clausen, Goth princess; and my favorite, Reilly Liebhard, school genius.<br />  The teachers are &quot;types&quot; are well: There's Joe Goracke, from &quot;the old school&quot;; Lori Boynton, assistant principal and resident hardass, and Mary Haugen, director of activities and athletics, who insists on calling sports co-curricular activities. The most compelling are the newbies, Mike Carr, first-year social studies and Mara Corey, first-year English. Burkett follows them around unrelentingly, exposing their every foible. Corey loses her job, mainly because she runs afoul of the less-liberal element in her department.<br />  Lots of issues are analyzed here.The cluelessness of the faculty for one thing. They think the dates written on the bathroom walls signify another Columbine-like event, when in really they advertize a national pot-smoking day. Even the NHS students show up for it, as does Burkett. She also hits the &quot;self esteem&quot; fad hard. Teachers are not allowed to say anything negative about students, lest they damage their fragile egos. Burkett blames this for the mind set that led to Columbine.<br />  I have to say that when I first read the book I thought Burkett had an ax to grind (She does admit at one point that high school was not a good time for her), but I must admit she got most of it right. There's the popularity contest going on, among the teachers, there's the petty bickering and back stabbing in the lounge, there's the problem with discipline (everyone else has one, but not me) and there're the sweet, lovely parents who won't stand up for the teachers.

US	52809057	RW2OSUEH5YBCA	0553110721	698766211	Dune: House Harkonnen	Books	4	3	6	N	N	A worthy successor	I've never been much of a science fiction fan, unless you count the Twilight Zone and Outer Limits. But, when I was a beginning teacher, some of my students were reading DUNE by Frank Herbert, and I gave it a try. I guess it was the melange, a kind of hallucinogenic spice that heightens your intellect, and the giant sand worms that could be ridden around the desert like living trolley cars, but I loved it. I read several of them, but then Frank Herbert died. I was vaguely aware that his son Brian was now writing the series, but I was a little leery about taking a chance until I saw it offered by one of my book clubs.<br /> The number of characters and plot lines is a bit daunting at first, but around page two hundred I finally got used to it. It's also somewhat hard to keep track of exactly where you are at times. The setting is a galaxy or the Imperium. Emperor Shaddam, more ruthless than Ghengis Khan, rules over the Imperium. He has a sidekick called a mentat (think Spock) who is plotting with him to take over the spice trade.<br /> The main character is Duke Leto Atreides, a great-grandson of Emperor Elrood IX, who presides over Caladan. His concubine, a defrocked noblewoman, wants him to marry her and declare their son his heir. He scorns her for a better political match.<br /> The villain in the piece is grossly fat Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, who's been cursed by the Bene Gesserit, a sisterhood with a desire to dethrone the emperor and create a theocracy. The Harkonnens control the spice trade, the most valuable commodity in the Imperium.<br /> Then there's Pardot Kynes, the planetologist who wants to turn Dune into a garden. His son, Liet-Kynes is part Fremen (revolutionary commoner) who fights the Harkonnens. Another plot line includes Planet Ix, which has been taken over by the Tleilaxu who have enslaved the populace. Kailea, Duke Leto's concubine and the mother of his son Victor, is the daughter of the former ruler of Ix. Her brother Rhombur also lives on Caladan. On Ix, the freedom fighter C'tair endures a lonely struggle against the Tleilaxu. On Geidi Prime, the home planet of the Harkonnens, Gurney Halleck's sister is kidnapped by the Harkonnens and he spends years trying to find her and steal her back.<br /> Meanwhile a protege of Leto's, Duncan Idaho, is training to become a Swordmaster. It's an eight year course and when finished he will work for Leto. I was impressed by how well Herbert and Anderson handled the passage of time. At the beginning of the novel, Duncan is just starting his training; at the end, he's become a Swordmaster. With virtually hundreds of characters and umpteen plot lines, that's not easy.<br /> Lots of juggling going on here, but all of the plots are interconnected and many of the hundreds of characters wind up on the same planet at various times and we get to see the relationships. Some of the plot lines are unresolved to be taken up in the next book.<br /> It took me over three weeks to read the thing, but I'd say it is a worthy successor to the original DUNE. Some readers may find the villains hopelessly overdrawn. Harkonnen's nephew has absolutely no redeeming qualities. Some of you may remember the Sting movie based on Dune and the monstrously fat Harkonnen. He's just as repulsive here.<br /> Almost forgot. One of the main characters does get killed in the end. I thought that was a brave move on Herbert's part. This is also done very logically as is an earlier death of a rather likable Fremen.On Ix, the freedom fighter C'tair endures a lonely struggle against the Tleilaxu.

This definition fits PLAINSONG perfectly. It's about simple folks and their musical small-town lives in Holt, Colorado.<br /> PLAINSONG is divided into chapters named after the main characters. Tom Guthrie is an American History teacher with a clinically depressed wife.<br /> Ike and Bobby Guthrie are Tom's sons. They have a magical paper route that gives the reader a panorama of Holt and some of the mystical characters who live there. \\"They were nine and ten, with dark brown hair and unmarked faces, and cheeks that were still as pure and dear as a girl's.\\" You'll love these two; they'll so innocent and humble, you'll want to adopt them. They do steal their fathers cigarettes, however, and smoke them out in the country.<br /> Victoria Roubideaux is one of Guthrie's students. She's pregnant and her mother kicks her out of the house. One of her teachers, Maggie Jones, arranges for her to stay with the McPheron brothers, two old bachelor ranchers with hearts as big as Colorado. They're the real stars of the book.<br /> Guthrie's wife leaves him; he has problems with one of his male students, who takes a swing at him. The parents take the boy's side. There's a fight scene, during which you'll want to jump inside the book and take a few swings yourself.<br /> One of the most touching scenes is when the McPheron brothers go with Victoria to buy a crib for the new baby. There's humor, too. Victoria's worried about having hurt the baby. She's done some drinking and smoked some marijuana. To make her feel better, Raymond tells her about a heifer he had that swallowed a length of barbed wire and somehow managed not to hurt the calf. Later, Harold confronts him. \\"Where in the hell did you come up with that? I don't remember any such thing.\\"<br /> \\"I made it up.\\"<br /> \\"You made it up,\\" Harold said. He regarded his brother, who was staring out into the room. \\"What else you going to make up?\\"<br /> \\"Whatever I have to.\\"<br /> I skimmed over this book again to try do it justice. It took me four hours. I read over some of the scenes again, bawling like a baby. If this book doesn't make you cry, you haven't got a heart.R> I skimmed over this book again to try do it justice.

The first book of hers I read was ZOMBIES OF THE GENE POOL. I'm always looking for a writer who displays some originality and the title seemed appropriate. It wasn't. You see, there are two Sharyn McCrumbs. One writes Elizabeth McPherson goofiness about Star Trek conventioneers, the other Spencer Arroway/Nora Bonesteel Appalachian magic.<br />  THE HANGMAN'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER proved to be one of these. I was hooked. Can't wait for the next one. If you're looking for ambience, you'll find it here. Appalachian history and myth, a bit of mysticism. Nora Boonsteel is an old lady who can see into the future, but she acts as though it's just a genetic trait she's a little ashamed of. She has &quot;the sight&quot;; everybody in the North Carolina hills knows it and they believe it. So will you.<br />  In SONGCATCHER, Sheriff Spencer Arroway takes a back seat to folksinger Lark McCourry who's in search of The Rowan Stave, a folk song that's been handed down in her family for centuries. She knows a little of it: Upon the hill above the kirk at moon rise she did stand, To tend her sheep that Samhain eve, with rowan staff in hand. And where she's been and what she's seen, no living soul may know, and when she's come back home, she will be changed-oh!<br />  We are taken all the way back to 1759 when the first Malcolm MacQuarry comes to America, shanghaied from the Scottish island of Islay. We get a glimpse of the frontier North Carolina, The Civil War, and other historical eras, rather like James Michener. Each generation passes along The Rowan Stave up to Lark's father, a solitary, unfriendly man, with whom Lark has severed relations.<br />  I made it all the way to page 219 before discovering I was missing the last thirty pages or so. Yeah, just like the Shaq commericial where his dog eats the last page of his mystery. So, this one lost some of its vigor, but that's not Sharyn McCrumb's fault. If this is the first one of the Nora Bonesteel novels you've read, you'll love it. If not, it's on the `B' list.s is the first one of the Nora Bonesteel novels you've read, you'll love it.

Ptui. Sue Grafton, on the other hand, has got the writing cojones.<br />  Nobody out there has the imagistic flair that Grafton flaunts. Sure, sometimes she overdoes it. Early on in this one, she describes a new office she's renting. The paint, the molding, the carpeting, the lighting, the view, the dimensions. The story comes to a screeching halt, and I'm saying to myself, &quot;This damn well better be important!&quot; It was, kinda.<br />  The storyline of `P' IS FOR PERIL deals with the disappearance of Dr. Dowan Purcell. Kinsey is hired by the doctor's ex-wife. She doesn't like her; she's not sure she wants to take the case, although she's hard up for cash. Kinsey takes the retainer, agrees to work on it for a few days. The doctor's disappeared before; he's had an alcohol problem. He could turn up. Kinsey discovers someone at the doctor's clinic was cooking the books, charging the government too much for medi-care. Purcell was only the manager; the owners of the clinic become suspects. So does Purcell's new young wife, Crystal.<br />  I wasn't too impressed with the scene where Kinsey discovers what happened to the doc. It involves a telescope. I've read a lot of mysteries and the telescope led me to believe that someone was watching the ex-wife's house. Nope, just a telescope. Must've been a star watcher.<br />  For me the book was salvaged by Kinsey's octogenarian landlord, Henry. I was worried she was going to kill him off. The sweet old guy unravels a co-worker's billing problem and in the process provides a clue implicating the person at the clinic responsible for the medi-care scam. I'd like to see Grafton do a book where Henry's the star.<br />  I thought I had this one figured out half way through the book; I wasn't far off. The motivation for the murder will really surprise you, though. Watch the foreshadowing. She does drop a few hints.	2002-01-19

When I first read an 87th precinct novel, I didn't like it. Not enough character development. Later, I went to a book sale at the library, got three of them in one book for a quarter. After reading all three, I got to know the detectives and their back stories. Steve Carella is the center of the stories. He's got a deaf mute wife and a son and a daughter, fraternal twins. He also has a chip on his shoulder over the way his father died (in a stick-up) and how the case was handled. Meyer Meyer is Carella's bald, Jewish sidekick, and Burt Kling is the youngest member of the squad and the resident lady's man. There's a black detective named Brown.<br />  Another amazing thing about these books is that McBain has invented his own city. Of course, it's based on New York. I read someplace that he did this to avoid research. There's always some eagle-eyed reader who knows New York better than the writer.<br />  MONEY, MONEY, MONEY is exactly what it sounds like. Everybody's after a big stash. A cocaine deal unravels and the abused parties are all out to get their money back. A retired Gulf War pilot is the most interesting of those involved. She makes Kinsey Millhone look like Little Orphan Annie. Fat Ollie Weeks draws jurisdiction in one of the ensuing murders. One of the culprits is literally thrown to the lions. Fat Ollie is one of my favorite recurring characters. McBain is having fun thumbing his nose at the PC police. Ollie hates everybody; he even does a W.C. Fields impression.<br />  Another satirical element is the front for the cocaine operation. Would you believe a publishing house?<br />  Every once in a while I hit a bad stretch where every book I buy stinks, but I'm too cheap to quit reading. The problem is always easily remedied, though, if there's an 87th precinct novel at hand.	2002-01-18

All of these small towns are mentioned in Keillor's Wobegon stories, usually in connection with the amateur baseball teams who play the Wobegon Whippets.<br /> I've read all of the Wobegon books. I've even read WLT: A RADIO ROMANCE, THE BOOK OF GUYS and WE ARE STILL MARRIED. And I love Keillor's monologues on Prairie Home Companion.<br /> I can also relate to this novel in another way. I grew up wanting to be a writer. I wrote stories for fun, showed them off to my friends, got some of them published in the high school newspaper. So I can understand why Gary, the protagonist, is so thrilled when he receives an Underwood typewriter from his uncle. Keillor peppers the book with samples of the stories and poems Gary writes on the Underwood. They're the most remarkable aspect of the book. Keillor manages to \\"overwrite\\" just as a fourteen-year-old would, showing glimpses of a remarkable talent.<br /> Now for what bothers me. Gary peruses dirty books, albeit camouflaged by the National Geographic, right in front of his Sanctified Brethren father. Somehow I doubt a skittish little nerd would have this kind of guts. Gary is also obsessed with his kissing cousin Kate. He writes stories about ravishing her, which his sister, a holy roller who'd embarrass Billy Graham with her overzealousness, almost always reads. ..  I haven't been quite this repulsed since I read Dolores Claiborne by Stephen King, another scatological endeavor.<br /> Read the book for Keillor's masterful job portraying Gary's youthful writing, but hold your nose when you encounter Kate.	2002-01-17

The main character is a little Welsh immigrant named Major Abel Jones, a British war veteran and a hero of Bull Run. He's also an investigator for the government. Parry does a wonderful job with this guy's accent. Just one example, &quot;It is a pickle you are in, then?&quot; He does use &quot;But let that bide&quot; a bit much, but you barely notice it after you've read a couple of the books.<br />  CALL EACH RIVER JORDAN centers around the Battle of Shiloh, which Jones becomes enmeshed in as he tries to report to General Grant. Everyone's running away, so Jones takes charge of a few of the more malleable of the scared soldiers and forms them into a unit.<br />  We eventually meet Grant and W.T. Sherman and P.T.G. Beauregard, of whom Jones doesn't think much, and we get to the jist of the matter, which is to find out who's been lynching slaves. The most recent case is the hanging of forty men, women and children at a crossroads.<br />  I always find that the best mysteries are those in which there's some humor to go along with the suspense. Some of that occurs when Jones falls captive to some Confederates on his way to see Beauregard. One of them is a fellow Welsh immigrant, whose accent Jones recognizes as being from a certain village near his. Jones compares the man's accent to his own, which he thinks is devoid of any trace of his former brogue. Jones also hates horses and he's given one named Rascal, that's way too much horse for him.<br />  Parry employs a standard cast of characters: The rogue Molloy, with whom he fought in India, is getting married and isn't in this one, but the moody Doctor Mick Tyrone is shown sawing off arms and legs in the aftermath of battle. Jones and Tyrone are usually in the midst of some philosophical discourse. My favorite is Mrs. Schutzengel, Jones's landlady in Washington. She's a socialist, a devotee of Karl Marx. Jones also has a wife, Mary Myfanwy, whom he dearly loves but rarely sees.<br />  Once again, this is one of those novels where the characters are so great that you just want to look in on them to see what they've been doing lately.iscourse.

I loved MORTAL NUTS (set at the Minnesota State Fair), THE RING GAME, and DRAWING DEAD, all featuring my man Joe Crow and an assemblage of minor characters who steal the show every time.<br />  I guess you can't really blame Hautman for wanting to stretch.<br />He's got the full-fledged premise (If you try to be somebody you're not, you'll lose everything); he's got the interesting little tidbits about the Rag trade; he's got the layered perspectives.<br />  Okay then, here's what's wrong: He kills off the most interesting character, Lars Larsen, almost immediately. Lars is a con man who cheats Mac MacWray (What's with the alliterative names?)out of the money the fool borrowed from his in-laws to start his own business. After Lars is gone, we're stuck with Casper Milktoast and his wife Dogbody, who get involved in soap opera shenanigans we're all read before. I also didn't buy the fact that Mac just happens to find Larson at Isla Mujeres. No set-up, no nothing. We're just supposed to believe it's a small, small world. Then there's the ending. Mac finds his way back to Mexico; he's a ruined man. He visits the edge of the cliff where his descent into treachery began. I kept screaming, &quot;JUMP! JUMP!&quot;, but if he did, Hautman doesn't tell us he did. Maybe we were supposed to believe that Mac was essentially a good man and that he's there eating his liver for letting Lars Larson die or that he was trying to somehow turn back the clock so he'd have another chance to reach down and pull Lars out of the jaws of death. We learn about this epilogue through the eyes of the Mexican cop we met earlier, who just happens to be there at the right time to provide a denouement.<br />  Oh well, I still have a few Joe Crow novels to look forward to.

I first learned about Mr. White's Confession while perusing the variety section of the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Clark had won the Edgar award for the novel and was surprised to find out that it qualified as a mystery, but it was the setting that captured my attention. St. Paul, Minnesota, was once a haven for criminals like Dillenger and Alvin &quot;Creepy&quot; Karpis of the Ma Barker gang. The deal was for them to behave while in the City, but when the heir to the Hamm's Beer fortune was kidnapped, it all began to unravel.<br /> Clark captures the aura of the place in this novel set in 1939. The police are still as hard-nosed and as corrupt as ever. Transients receive especially harsh treatment. The hero, Lt. Wesley Horner, is one of the good guys. The reader immediately relates to this sad man who's just lost his wife and who's awfully hard on himself. He falls in love with an underage transient. He resists for a time (it wouldn't be right), but she manages to convince him that age doesn't matter. Meanwhile, he's investigating the murder of a showgirl and the main suspect is an amateur photographer, Herbert White, who photographs dime-a-dance girls. There's no evidence White had anything to do with the girl's murder. He's just a weirdo with an awfully poor memory. But then another dancer is killed. She also modeled for White. Perhaps the biggest twist is when Horner's young lover disappears and he fears she's succumbed to the maniac on the loose; Horner hates himself even more for not being able to protect her. White is browbeaten into a confession and winds up in Stillwater, the state prison. Horner doesn't believe he's guilty and sets out to prove he's not. One of the most stirring scenes is when Horner goes to visit White in Stillwater, the prison being reminiscent of the place we get the word &quot;bedlam&quot;. White is working on his memory, writing a journal on the slimey prison walls. Horner sends him paper every three weeks. Ultimately, the reader discovers the real killer, but Horner never does.<br />  The obituary at the end is a nice stroke. It does in a few lines what would ordinarily take pages to tell.every three weeks.

I've always been Civil War nut, watched all of Ken Burns's PBS special, read COLD MOUNTAIN before it hit the best-seller list.<br /> But, alas, Elvira, the reenactor, is not the focus of Hamilton's novel. There is a dramatic scene toward the end where Elvira learns it's not such a good idea to pretend to be one of the boys, but the real plot thread is Henry Shaw's &quot;Inadvertent&quot; reading of his mother's e-mail to her lover. She's a piano player in a group that plays antique music; her lover is a violin maker. Henry's father teaches history at the Chicago private school Henry and his sister attend. He's not too romantic. I guess that's supposed to be ironic, considering he's indirectly responsible for Elvira's obsession.<br /> Henry, the little snoop, keeps on monitoring the course of his mother's affair.<br /> The whole story is a flashback, written ten years after Henry read the letter, which gives Hamilton a reason, I suppose, to assume the empathetic tone toward the mother's affair that bothers me. Henry's had time to reflect; he now sees his mother as a human being with foibles and all that rot. Then there's the title: DISOBEDIENCE? I don't know, maybe she intended that to be double entendre, but I doubt it. INFIDELITY would be a better fit.	2002-01-10
US	52809057	R152OC963AZY93	0892967471	681692460	Murder on the Trans-Siberian Express: A Porfiry Petrovich Rostnikov Novel	Books	5	15	15	N	Y	Kudos from Dave	In my humble opinion the Porfiry Rostnikov mystery series is the best one going. It rivals Martin Cruz Smith's Gorky Park for a realistic portrayal of Russia. Stuart Kaminsky's series may be better, though. Cruz Smith gave up writing about mother Russia after the Wall came crashing down. Kaminsky has done his research and he makes modern Russia one of the characters.<br />  The ensemble of human characters jumps right off the page, especially Porfiry, chief inspector in the Office of Special Investigations of the Moscow Police, a unit that handles cases no one else wants. His nickname is &quot;The Washtub&quot; because of his weightlifter build; he's lost one of his legs due to a war wound; and he &quot;meditates&quot; by doing volunteer plumbing around his apartment building. His immediate underling, Emil Karpov, is an unrepentant Communist who looks like Bela Lugosi, only taller. Other detectives include Rostinikov's son Iosef, a former actor and Afghani veteran; his fianc&eacute;, and Sasha Tkach, the Robert Redford of the cast, whose wife has left him, mainly because of his meddling mother who had lived with them.<br />  Kaminsky's strategy in Murder on the Trans-Siberian Express is to have the detectives divvy up three cases. Tkach pursues a woman is murdering subway businessmen, up close and personal, with a kitchen knife. Karpov tackles the case of a missing punk rocker, a possible kidnapping victim. Rostinov takes a trip on the Trans-Siberian Express in search of an intriguing historical document involving the Tsarina.<br />  Believe me, it's not the mystery that holds your attention in Kaminsky's Rostinov novels. You just want to hang out with these people, and you hate it when the story ends.	2002-01-07
