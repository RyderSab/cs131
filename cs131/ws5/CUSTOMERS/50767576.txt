It still has mental digressions on the soulless corporate film industry, bodily functions, Napster, and Lloyd's improbable sleeping arrangements at Cannes, but it also addresses the kinds of disasters that can and will befall first-time filmmakers, and takes the reader step-by-step from pre-production through distribution. He even reveals the secret of raising the funds to make a movie (pitch your story to everyone you meet and eventually you'll find an inspired--or gullible--rich investor). Co-authors Haaga and Jahnke often disagree with their boss and mentor, and are actually given substantial chunks of the book to refute him (particularly his personal obsession with shooting on 35mm film when most low-budget indies are shooting digitally). Buy all the other filmmaking books, too--you'll slog through them and pick up worthwhile info--but Lloyd's book is actually fun to read and it's frequently hilarious. And unlike nearly every other how-to author out there, Lloyd Kaufman actually runs a production and distribution company that has survived thirty years, and underneath the humor are many hard-earned lessons. Even if you don't plan to do a kitschy, monster blood-fest, the everyday issues of keeping a set running inexpensively make it worthwhile.	2005-02-01

Unlike industry-oriented publications like Jane's, Zaloga explains the concepts and methods of land combat with a maximum of clarity and a minimum of jargon. It is well-illustrated as well.

Author Zaloga is one of the foremost experts on Soviet era armored fighting vehicles, and he did an excellent job considering that this was published before the fall of the Warsaw Pact opened up the Russian state archives. The book has a wide format, and the pictures are well-reproduced on glossy paper. There are also numerous small sketches illustrating vehicle fittings and changes made over the course of production. The centerspread features color drawings of vehicles in period markings. Overall, the book has held up remarkably well over the years, and deserves a place on the bookshelf of all AFV enthusiasts.	2003-03-26

This book, originally published by Squadron in the United States and Arms and Armour Press in Britain (and frequently reissued), is an excellent study of the AFV markings and camouflage practices of all the combatants in the first phase of World War Two. As such, it is one of the only sources in English for  French, Polish and Belgian vehicle schemes, and it has valuable information for British, German and Russian vehicles as well.

It traces the development of the weapon and its deployment by Russia, its allies, and the third world customers who bought the export versions. Zaloga also reveals the Soviet designations for the various subtypes. The Russian obsession with secrecy meant that many spurious designations appeared in NATO manuals on the subject, and the author finally clears up the actual designations of the variant models. The T-72's poor performance in combat is examined and the reasons are discussed, and it is compared to its design rivals, the T-64 and the T-80. There is a nice selection of pictures of all subtypes, and a color center section by artist Peter Sarson shows the markings and camouflage of the vehicle. This title is aimed at model builders, wargamers and those with a casual interest in military technology, but the format is too limited for the dedicated historian or defense analyst.	2002-04-24

It offers the usual potted history of the Panzer arm, and could just as well have been written in 1970.  It has nothing new to add, despite the avalanche of fresh material which has been unearthed in the archives of Russia and Eastern Europe in the last ten years. What are truly appalling are the color illustrations, which are computer generated. This in and of itself would not be bad, but the illustrations resemble computer graphics from a 1980's video wargame blown up to full-page size. They are literally quite useless even for purposes of casual identification of the various types of tanks depicted (for instance, the Panzer IV turret has six sides in real life--in the drawing it has four). Proportions are wrong and details ignored or invented by the illustrator.<BR>The photographs are no better. For the most part, they are the same propaganda shots we have been seeing for the last 60 years, but most are also marred by digital artifacts resulting from cheap scanning (whether this is the fault of the publishing house or the Slovenian subcontractor who actually printed the book I don't know). If you want a book on German World War Two Armor, get one by Thomas Jentz, Hilary Louis Doyle, Jean Restayn, Horst Scheibert, Bruce Culver, Uwe Feist or Walter Spielberger. All of these authors have solid scholarship to offer in the field, and provide good value for money. Give this book a pass.	2002-02-09

KPFW.I to Tiger II (Schiffer Book for Collectors)	Books	4	13	13	N	N	Useful Overview of German Tanks	Thomas Jentz and Hilary Louis Doyle are two of the foremost experts on German armor of the Second World War, and this volume is a concise catalog of the machines, with good clear photographs supplemented by Doyle's drawings. It is a welcome offering, since there are several dreadful titles out now which cash in on the current revival of interest in World War Two, but are thrown together by hack writers using secondary sources. Jentz and Doyle use only original documents and surviving vehicles as references, and they do not allow the myths and half-truths which have arisen over the last half-century to cloud the issues. In a sense, this book compiles much of the technical information of their self-published  book series, Panzer Tracts, but the drawings are limited to one side-view, and not to a constant scale, whereas the Panzer Tracts drawings are nearly all to 1/35th scale, and show four views. Curiously, the book devotes a half page on each vehicle to drawings showing the angle of approach and the angle of departure for each tank (that is, how steep a slope it can safely descend or climb), and the depth of water it could ford. Personally, I would rather derive this information from the text, and see the free space devoted to additional plan views of the vehicle. While this book is useful for recognizing the basic tank types and most subtypes, it is not adequate to construct a scale model of one with complete confidence, so their other books are still a necessity for the modeller. If you already have their other books, you can probably give this one a pass, but if you are looking for a starter volume on German tanks, this is good place to start.	2002-01-30

Author Wolfgang Schneider has solicited help from veterans and their families to produce an unparalleled work which combines information from wartime unit diaries, delivery records, and strength reports as well as the veterans' personal journals to create a day to day history of every Tiger unit. But the real treat of this book is the illustrations. He uses very few of the official photos which have been published to death over the last six decades. As it happens, German troops were avid shutterbugs despite wartime regulations, and the veterans and their families have shared thousands of personal snapshots which have never been published before. The photos are well-reproduced in large format on glossy paper, and the captions give specific details as to the location, unit and date of every picture. There are also numerous color drawings by famed military artist Jean Restayn. Combine this with Thomas Jentz's excellent technical history of the Tiger and you have an ideal library on the beast.	2002-01-06

However, it is full of generalizations and some outright errors, and the whole thing seems to have been thrown together rather quickly. A far better choice would be any of Steven J.

Best of all is Richard Hunnicutt's enormous work \\"Sherman: A History of the American Medium Tank.\\" Though many would balk at the price, it is by far the best work available, with thousands of photos and multiview 1:48th scale drawings by D.P.

Zaloga is the author of many books on Soviet and Russian armor, but the declassification of Russian archives has allowed him to reexamine the subject and clear away many misconceptions. The Red Army's most important heavy tanks of the war were the KV series (named after defense minister Klimenti Voroshilov), and the IS series (named after dictator Iosef Stalin). The KV-1 was a shock to the Germans when they invaded in 1941, as they had few guns which could penetrate its armor, and its 76 mm gun could knock out any German tank then in service. As the KV became obsolete in 1943, a  number of improved designs were explored until the Stalin series was introduced. The new IS-2 combined heavy armor, a cramped interior (to keep weight down) and a huge 122 mm gun based on the standard Soviet field gun. The gun could knock out the German Panther and Tiger series at long range, and it fired an enormous high explosive shell useful in demolishing fortified buildings. Unlike the German heavies, the IS-2 Stalin was simple and cheap (an advantage it shared with its stablemate, the T-34 medium tank), which allowed it to be built in much higher numbers than its German counterparts. Though this book is a primarily a large-format photo essay and is clearly aimed at the model builder, the book devotes eight pages of very fine print to a history of Soviet heavy tank development. Photos are mostly fresh subjects gleaned from Russian archives, rather than the handful of Russian and German propaganda photos that have published previously, and the reproduction is generally quite good (the glossy paper helps). Captions are also quite detailed, and where possible, the actual date, location and unit involved are identified. Though the book is devoted to heavy tanks from 1941-1945, it includes coverage of the pre-war designs in service at the beginning of the war, including the bizarre, multi-turreted T-35, as well as postwar developments begun during the war, such as the IS-3 and IS-4. It also has numerous photos of the self-propelled gun variants based on the KV and Stalin chassis. In addition, there are 16 color drawings of vehicles in service. Another superb title from Concord.	2001-06-17

The T-34 was the most important Russian tank of World War Two, and thanks to its almost brutal simplicity, was produced in greater numbers than any comparable British, German or American design. The T-34 remained in production in Russia after the war, and was later built under license in Poland and Czechoslovakia. This tank saw combat all over the world, including Korea, Hungary, the Middle East, Vietnam, and Africa, a few remain in service in the Third World today. This is the second  Osprey New Vanguard volume on the T-34 (the first is the T-34-76 from the same authors), and it offers an excellent variety of photos, multi-view scale drawings, and a concise but detailed history of the development and use of the T-34 from the latter half  of World War Two through the early 1990's. There is also coverage of self-propelled gun and recovery vehicles based on the T-34 chassis. As with all Osprey books, there are excellent color plates (by Peter Sarson) depicting vehicles in service, as well as a color cutaway of the vehicle interior. This title would be a good companion to the photo books on the T-34 series that Zaloga has previously written, published by Squadron and Concord. A terrific value for money for the historian or model builder.	2001-06-17

There are hundreds of photos of all types of armored and unarmored vehicles. If you are just  interested in the famous vehicles, then this book is only slightly useful--for instance, there are much better references on the Sherman tank available. But for an overview of all vehicles, including obscure machines that never served in frontline combat, this is a unique reference. Where else could you find photos of arctic snow tractors of the 1950's, or experimental light tanks of the 1930's, or airfield tractors of the US Air Force? Most types or subtypes receive a long paragraph and a single b&amp;w photo. Should be in the library of every serious military vehicle historian.	2001-04-26

Based on the chassis of the Tiger II (or &quot;King Tiger&quot;), it replaced the turret with a fixed fighting compartment carrying a massive 128 mm antitank gun. It was a technical failure, since operations showed that the drive train couldn't deal with the vehicle's vast weight, and over half the vehicles built had to be blown up after they broke down, bogged down, or simply ran out of gas. This is the second half of Andrew Devey's work on the Jagdtiger, and for the model builder or historian, it is the more useful of the two. Other reviewers have taken issue with technical errors present in Volume One, which covered the development of the machine. Volume Two is more promising, in that it details the operational history of the only two battalions to operate the Jagdtiger, the 653rd and the 512th, and Devey attempts to track as many of the 80+ machines built as surviving records allow. For an operational history of the just the 653rd, a better choice would be Karlheinz Munch's &quot;Combat History of Schwere Panzerjager Abteilung 653,&quot; published by J.J. Fedorowicz in Canada. It has more detailed information, as well as more oversized photos with superior reproduction. But for the 512th, Devey's book is virtually the only source in English (Otto Carius' memoir, &quot;Tigers in the Mud,&quot; has some info on one company of the 512th, which he commanded, but the companies operated independently of each other). While the book has its weaknesses, particularly in photo reproduction, it is still a breathtaking improvement on what was available just four years ago.	2000-12-20

Karlheinz Munch has cleared away decades of half-truths and assumptions by going directly to the source. He has interviewed unit veterans and consulted original military documents and private diaries to produce the most complete history of the 653rd Heavy Tank Destroyer Battalion, a unit that operated some of the most remarkable vehicles of the war, the Elefant and the Jagdtiger. The other surprise was that the soldiers were avid shutterbugs, and the veterans and their familes have opened their private photo collections to the author. These are vehicles previously known through a mere handful of German propaganda photos and US Army Signal Corps pictures. Suddenly, we have not dozens but hundreds of fresh photos, showing details of operations, unit markings, and more. Rarities include a Tiger P prototype converted to a command tank, a recovery Panther with a Panzer IV turret bolted to the roof, a Russian T-34 converted to a German antiarcraft tank, and more. Publisher J.J. Fedorowicz does not believe in half-measures. There are color drawings by famed military artist Jean Restayn, and multiview drawings by Hilary Louis Doyle.

This title is the last of that series, covering the second half of World War Two. The title refers to Field Marshall Montgomery's desire for what we today call a &quot;Main Battle Tank,&quot; a British counterpart to and improvement upon the American Sherman tank. It would replace the overly specialized medium, or &quot;cruiser&quot; tanks, as well as the heavy &quot;infantry&quot; tanks then in service. No such vehicle was developed during the war, as British industry was obligated to keep obsolescent designs in production to avoid shortages at the front caused by retooling factories. Ultimately, Britain did produce a universal tank, the Centurion, but it missed the war. The text is detailed, but illustrations are few and far between. The book is a good starting point for historians, but model builders will want Mr. Fletcher's more recent books published by Osprey, Schiffer, and Darlington Productions, which feature more drawings and photographs.	2000-12-20

It is a short but useful photo essay on three minor subtypes in the Tiger family, the Elefant, a self-propelled 88 mm gun on the chassis of Dr. Porsche's rejected Tiger P, the Sturmtiger, a turretless assault vehicle that launched converted antisubmarine rockets, and the Jagdtiger, a self-propelled 128mm antitank gun on the King Tiger chassis.

Not properly science fiction, or even garden-variety fantasy, it is a more like  magic realism. As always, Wolfe likes to break rules, confounding the reader's expectations at every turn. The point of view character is not a larger than life hero like Severian or Patera Silk. Rather, he is a department store furniture salesman with subtle but serious mental problems, the sort of gray little man you might see every day, but couldn't describe five minutes later. He has also discovered that there are doors from here to there, &quot;there&quot; being a parallel world where women dominate and men die young. As the novel begins, he is recovering from a brief fling with a woman who has affected him like no other, and his pursuit of her leads him to discover that she is the physical embodiment of the Female Principal itself, the Goddess. She walks among mankind from time to time, and selects lovers who are unlikely to be believed (like the probably schizophrenic narrator). The central character's fractured psychology and his willingness to accept whatever reality is foisted upon him reminded me of a fever dream (and indeed, the second time I approached the book, I was down with the flu, and curiously, it made me more responsive to the material). As Wolfe moves his character back and forth between the worlds (with stops in mental institutions on both sides), he explores themes of alienation and isolation, the knowledge that one is fundamentally damaged and therefore different from one's fellows. And he unashamedly explores obsessive love and redemption from  a  man's point of view (curious that there is a whole literary industry devoted to women's expressions of love, but nothing for men--this kind of vulnerability is too frightening to most male readers I suppose). And it addresses the age-old question, is love a gift that is given or a prize to be earned?bility is too frightening to most male readers I suppose).

The Germans first created the Sturmgeschutz as a cheap fire support vehicle for the infantry, but it soon became a mount for long-barreled, high-velocity antitank guns. The first chapter covers prewar experiments, but the bulk of the book is devoted to the Sturmgeschutz based on the Panzer III chassis, and each production variant gets a chapter. The Sturmgeschutz IV, based on the Panzer IV chassis, is also covered, as are the self-propelled 105 mm and 150 mm assault howitzers on the Panzer III chassis. There are also bonus chapters covering antiaircraft vehicles, halftracks, and recovery vehicles used by Sturmgeschutz units. The technical history is well-balanced, offering information for both the model builder and the automotive engineer, and the three-view drawings and cutaways by Hilary Louis Doyle are to the modeller's scale of 1/35th. Though the title was one of the first of Walter Spielberger's books to be translated into English, it is actually one of his most recent books, and is far superior to the Panzer III, Panzer IV, and Panther books. This was also one of his last collaborations with researcher Thomas Jentz, and the style is almost identical to that of Jentz's own series of books on German armor (also published by Schiffer).	2000-12-17

Walter Spielberger's book offers an overview of the Panther tank's development, as well as its variants, the Bergepanther recovery vehicle, and the Jagdpanther tank destroyer (an 88mm self-propelled gun). There are also drawings by Hilary Louis Doyle, though they are side views only, and not to a constant scale. Spielberger is the author of a well-respected series of books on German armored vehicles, but this English-language edition is slightly out of date, repeating some fallacies about the aborted Panther II and Panther F projects. Spielberger's colleague, Thomas Jentz, who once worked for him as a researcher, has since written his own Panther book (also published by Schiffer), which corrects many errors thanks to newly-uncovered information found in government and factory archives. Jentz's book also has three-view drawings by Doyle in 1/35th scale. However, Jentz's book covers only the battle tank, not the recovery and self-propelled gun variants. I would recommend the Thomas Jentz book to those interested in building a model of the Panther tank (including the Panther II and Panther F), while Spielberger's volume is more useful to those interested in the automotive engineering of the Panther, or the subsidiary variants.	2000-12-16

This is a large-format photo book with many pictures filling the page, so details are beautifully rendered. There had to be some limits for reasons of space, so only German and Czech tanks are covered. The myriad self-propelled guns, recovery vehicles, and half tracks used by the Germans are not included.  The weak point of the book is the captions. Horst Scheibert actually served in many of the vehicles he depicts, but like many front line troops, he only paid attention to technical differences that actually affected the tanks' fighting abilities. So he is a bit vague as to accurately identifying exact production subtypes. Also, many Bundesarchiv negatives are not catalogued by the geographical origin of the photos, and in many cases he is clearly guessing as to the location and date of the pictures. Still, as long as you are armed with other technical references, this is an excellent addition to your AFV library.	2000-12-16

Fedorowicz in Canada), then this little booklet is a useful alternative. While the other Tiger books usually reprint the same propaganda photos with useless captions, Schneider actually gives a very brief history of each Tiger unit, and offers a handful of photos showing the King Tiger in service with that unit. Thus, you get a better understanding of different camouflage and marking practices in each Panzerabteilung. Combine this title with Thomas Jentz's King Tiger book published by Osprey, and you have an economical but authoritative reference library on the beast.	2000-12-16

The content is split about evenly between two competing designs, the Crusader and the Covenanter. While the Crusader was Britain's main battle tank in the Western Desert battles against Rommel's Afrika Korps and the Italians, the Covenanter stayed behind in Britain (its cooling system was woefully inadequate). After the Sherman tank became available in large numbers, Crusaders were rebuilt as antiaircraft vehicles and gun tractors, while the Covenanters were scrapped.      Aimed mainly at the model builder, this title has all the strengths and weaknesses inherent in Osprey's military booklets. The color drawings of operational vehicles reproducing their camouflage and unit markings are quite useful, but the book's 48 pages are very limiting, particularly since it covers two distinct vehicles. Osprey favors text over photos, and most pictures are small and murky, so you might also want to track down \\"Tanks in Camera,\\" Mr. Fletcher's hardbound photo essay on the desert war. Thomas Jentz has also done a photo book on the early desert war.	2000-12-11

David Fletcher, of Britain's Tank Museum, has written numerous books covering British tank development from the First World War through World War Two, rivaling Richard Hunnicutt's chronicle of American armor. However, Mr. Fletcher's series of books for the Tank Museum were largely text, with very few illustrative photos. With this new title, he makes up lost ground, with a very nice selection of large format photos of the desert war against Rommel. Most of the photos are fresh subjects. The reproduction is quite good, and the paper is glossy (though some snapshots of obscure subjects look like, well, snapshots). We can only hope he follows up with additional titles on the campaigns of 1939-40, and 1944-45.	2000-12-11

Just one chapter was devoted to HD, with nothing useful about how to actually shoot in this medium, and there was no coverage of DV moviemaking either. The book was targeted towards Hollywood industry types who planned to shoot on 35 mm film, digitize their footage, and rent an expensive Avid editing suite for all post-production. Even Avid has had to rethink their business model in the intervening years, as competitors have offered more affordable software for desktop computers. Unless you just want an historical journey through obsolete editing systems, don't waste half a c-note on this book...	2000-10-16

Hilary Louis Doyle does his usual superb job on the 1/35th scale drawings which cover all major production variants of the standard gun tank, as well as the prototypes (for a history of the failed Porsche prototype, see the same authors' book now available from Panzer Tracts). This is the first set of published drawings that accurately depicts the asymmetrical shape of the Tiger I turret (it bulges out slightly on the left, so the gun is mounted off-center in the mantlet to bring it back to the centerline of the turret). This is one volume of a three-volume series, the other titles covering the development of the Tiger II and the operations of the Tiger battalions. Jentz's book concentrates on the vehicle's general interior and exterior layout, but doesn't go into the technical depth of Walter Spielberger's books (most readers don't plan to actually rebuild a Tiger transmission anytime soon).	2000-10-02

It covers his childhood during the London Blitz, his early training as a stage actor, his combat service in the Korean War (and why  the smell of garlic frightens him to this day), a decade as a literally  starving actor in London, and his big break in &quot;Zulu.&quot; He crossed  paths with an amazing number of the sixties' movers and shakers, and he  tells wonderful stories. Having had a truly blessed career, Michael Caine  is a living example of the adage that what we call &quot;good luck&quot; is  really the art of recognizing opportunity when it falls in your lap, and  having the courage to act on it. Highly Recommended!	2000-07-13

Michael Caine delivers a direct and useful how-to book for aspiring film actors. He doesn't delve into the psychological underpinnings of acting-there are hundreds of books that already do that. He assumes that  you've taken classes, appeared in plays, and understand the artistic  aspects of creating a character. He also understands the psychological leap  required for the actor to learn how to deal with the camera, and the  complex interrelationship between actor, director, and crew. For the  performer about to step onto a soundstage for the first time, this volume  is a must. The book could have been subtitled, &quot;Film Acting: the First  Hundred Mistakes and How To Avoid Them.&quot;	2000-07-13

There is no  second-hand information of any kind, and no propagation of postwar myths.  There is less pure engineering information than the earlier work by Walter  Spielberger (i.e. don't expect diagrams of the inner workings of engine and  transmissions), but the intended audience for this book is clearly the  model-builder. The numerous drawings are to the popular modeler's scale of  1/35th, and numerous detail photos will aid the would-be model builder. In  combination with such works as Wolfgang Schneider's &quot;Tigers in  Combat,&quot; you would have an ideal library on the King Tiger. However,  this volume does not cover the Jagdtiger tank destroyer (Schiffer does  publish a two-volume work on this vehicle by another author).	2000-02-10
