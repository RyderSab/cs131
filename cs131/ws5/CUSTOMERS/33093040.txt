Wetfeet is a name that many MBAs know and their guides are ones they go to when they want the inside track for getting the interviews and ultimately their dream job. I say this b/c I'm an MBA who looked to this particular guide along with some i-banking company guides to get me prepared for interviews. it's been a tough couple of years, but i managed to snag a key internship last summer with the help of the WF guides, and am recommending them to any other biz types who want to do well in their interviews. oh yeah: my key internship has turned into a full-time job--one of only a handful given out my particular firm. tks to wetfeet. your guides were invaluable.	2003-04-10

I have read plenty of articles here and there on the HR industry, but this guide gives that extra layer of data that gives you a good idea of what's going on overall, where the industry is moving to and where you need to focus and improve in order to stay ahead of the curve and get into a company that will allow you to advance in your career. I've been doing HR/recruiting for a couple years now, for a small financial services firm. Now that i've read this guide, I feel that much more ready to move onto bigger and better, specifically to a larger firm in the same industry. I'm taking wetfeet's advice and enrolling in some business courses in order to back up my HR experience. I'm also glad to see the real people profiles and days in the life to better gauge if a larger firm is indeed the right place for me (i now think it is! and am more comfortable with the idea having read the guide).	2003-04-10

But I still want to get into this industry if at all possible. I've been in management consulting for several years now and have a few friends in the financial services industry. most of them have weathered the storm, though of course there are a few who've been handed pink slips. Still, I'm told that if you've got the skills and experience, you can still snag a job at one of the top banks. That said, I bought this guide to give me a sampling of what firms are doing these days, whether they're coming out of the worst of it, and who really has the most promising long-term outlook.

I'm hoping, after running through Ace I, II and III, that I'll go into my interviews cool, calm and collected. Not only did the first of the series really set a complete and thorough framework for how to approach cases, but it as well as II and III gave me a bunch of cases to practice on. That said, I realize that I could have bought I and II or I and III or that I could've just bought any one of the guides without really needing any one of the others to go ahead and try the cases. But I'm a big believer in doing as much advance preparation (especially in this tough job market) to nail an interview cold--so getting all 3 worked well for me. And i really, really liked reading through the bad and good answers for each case to help me figure out how to refine my own answers to the case questions. Thanks, WetFeet!

I've had a hard time getting good info on this company, so it was a relief to get a hold of this guide. I had a couple friends of friends who've worked at Monitor, and so i knew the rep was a good one. But since I couldn't get in touch with these friends of friends, the guide was the next best thing. Plus it's current, moreso than the insight from these FoFs who worked for Monitor several years ago. Thanks WetFeet. I'll be looking at your website some more to help me get my resume writing, interviewing and other skills up to speed.	2003-03-06

I appreciated having a guide such as this to read. It's clear the author was well connected to insiders in the organization. I got a good feel for the organization and I also liked that the guide wasn't all glowing and full of BS, despite McKinsey's god-like status in the consulting world. I liked that it talked to the Enron scandal and included a negative piece in the Recommended Reading section. It shows me that the author and wetfeet aren't trying to blow sunshine up my ...; that they're giving me a full picture of the organization, so that i can go into the interviews better prepared and able to ask the harder questions that will surely impress recruiters more than just parroting back the stuff anyone can get off the McKinsey corporate website.	2003-03-06

The writing is smooth, the reasoning is strong, and it's clear the author did his research--a good thing for me as it made my task of researching the company much easier. I went into the recruiting sessions with both guns firing, with the ammo furnished compliments of WetFeet. I felt good about my chances at snagging an internship with Goldman, but I felt like I got a leg up on the competition, having read through your guide. Thanks much!	2003-03-06

But Morgan Stanley among others has always had a solid reputation on the Street, and so I remain undeterred in trying to get a job either there or at another comparable firm. This guide is a good one for someone with my goals. I am feeling much more up to the job of landing an internship there. I understand better now what it's going to take and what I'm going to get out of working at MS. I really enjoyed the read. It was clear and concise. It cut through all the fat and got right to the meat of the matter in what I'd say is just the right amount of pages. I certainly don't have the time or inclination to read a tome on MS--as i've seen other company guides floating out there do. Rather, I like that this guide boils it down and tells me just what I need to know.	2003-03-06

But I now realize that it doesn't have to be a schmarmy, phoney thing, but rather a building up of real and positive relationships and calling upon those relationships in the right way to get you the job you deserve. This guide helped break down the process so that I am now pursuing contacts and feeling more confident about doing so. Especially in such tough times, it's important to be able to call on those you know to get you noticed. Otherwise, you're just a dime a dozen in the sea of resumes that go out to any and all job openings these days. That said, I've been able to set up some great discussions and even a few key interviews. I would recommend that people get this guide to help them over the networking hump and realize that you have more connections you can explore than you might think.	2003-02-25

Exactly the stuff I need now that I'm looking at making a career change, and internships look to be the best route towards making that change. I like that this guide lays out a bunch of different options that are less formal than the internships set up at big companies. Of course, I'll still try for those formal programs, but I'm also going to give the informal route a go and see how that pans out.	2003-02-19
