It has some intesting techniques to keep that vocabulary on memory.<br />However, if you are just starting studying anatomy or if the subject is new for you and you just want to read a little about it, better look for another book. I found in the internet very good sites and understood better many basic things such as blood circulation in those sites than reading this book. If it will be your first meeting with anatomy vocabulary, get another book.	2003-06-18

Every person who read this book will find interesting information and will recognize some own experiences trying to make some devices work, and I do not mean complex ones, but as simple as a light switch.<br />Actually, as the title reads, the book  deals with &quot;everyday things,&quot; though there are some parts that use examples like a nuclear plant or a cockpit.<br />Of course, we do not need to read this book to use such things, but you would enjoy reading it.	2003-06-14

It tries to make the subject simple, fun, and the most important thing, easy to remember.<br />You'll need to make a review of some grammar, but the book is self-contained to that purpose, and it gives you all necessary tools for the work. These tools will help you to understand how to write and speak better English, and if they were not enough for you, every &quot;rule&quot; has examples and these examples, in turn, are explained when needed.<br />The book recognizes English is a changing language, so there are exceptions for some rules, but it shows you the most general exceptions and helps you to decide which road you should take.<br />Nonnative English speakers, beware: The book has &quot;fun parts&quot; that could be difficult to understand. If you are not an intermediate or advanced speaker of English, better look for another book.<br />For Spanish speakers:<br />este es un buen libro para practicar y aprender gramática inglesa, pero está orientado a hablantes nativos del idioma, no a estudiantes. Si no están en un nivel avanzado, otro libro puede ser mejor.	2003-01-27

They are familiar with the internet but have no law studies.<BR>2. They have studied legal matters but don't know how to apply them to the internet.<br />If you are not in any of these cases, the book would be somehow difficult to understand.<br />Though the internet is a worldwide network, the book deals only with the US law; moreover, it recognizes the need for updating (edited: 1994). So, you should later go to another source for country-specific or updated information (there is plenty of books and the internet itself). And, due that the internet is always changing, you will have to update the information without regarding the book you read.	2003-01-07

The Stupid History Of The Human Race	Books	4	7	10	N	N	With a grain of salt	First, if you can tolerate a book with such a title in your bookshelf, continue reading.<br />This book is divided in three parts: Chronicles, questions and advice. <br />The contents of the first one, the longest, are just too much... stupid. Unbelievable stupid. Surely you have already heard or read about many of them, but others will look to you just as inventions of someone to get attention (you remember those guys in junior high, don't you?).<br />The second part is very similart to the first one. It tries always to show that everyone in earth is stupid.<BR>Just as in the first part, I realized that even it's a small book and easy to read (two lines to one page per chronicle), I become saturated after some minutes.<br />The third and last part becomes much better than the others. It gives you some interesting advice, though I cannot say how useful it would be for you.<br />If, by chance, you run out of topics for conversation, this book would give you plenty of them, but take them all with a grain of salt (be skeptic). I don't think it would be easy to find support for the hundreds of anecdotes in this book, that is, sources to show them true.	2002-12-16

Una cara de la moneda	Podemos decir sin dificultad que este es un libro contra el capitalismo; lo es. O que el autor da una opinión parcial; así lo hace.<br />En este libro se muestra lo que pretende ser la otra cara de la historia y las noticias: Los datos que no conseguiríamos al buscar en sitios &quot;oficiales&quot; (reportes del FMI, grandes agencias noticiosas y similares). En el libro se dan datos acerca de pobreza, miseria, traición, asesinatos, hambre,...<br />Podemos estar de acuerdo o no. De cualquier modo, para tener una mejor perspectiva de la situación, recomiendo leer también El manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano, libro que considero el complemento de Las venas abiertas de América Latina.<br />Aunque esté de más decirlo, conviene leer ambos libros críticamente, con la cabeza fría, como debe ser con los libros de estos temas.<br />Las venas... ha sido prohibido en algunos países, aunque está en su 73ra edición en español (2001). La primera edición es de 1970 y la revisión de 1978. Nada cambia de una a otra, sólo algunos datos son añadidos. Esto es una muestra de su gran popularidad, pero cada lector debe decidir acerca de la veracidad de su contenido.	2002-12-16

The &quot;theory&quot; is shown in a few pages. Just to tell you what you should write and avoid, including a list of verbs to help you writing.<br />There are also some examples of cover letters that I found useful. They show you the style, length and other features of these documents.<br />You would think that four stars may be too high if you have read other books on this subject, but I took only this book and it was enough for me: I was called for an interview. I am not giving five stars because I have not compared the book with any other.	2002-11-17

That may be the meaning of &quot;rough.&quot;<br />We had a bad experience when visiting Hokkaido: The book said a recommended site was 50 km South from the station we would get to. So we planned our trip with that idea in mind. But in the way we found the site at a map and it was 50 km NORTH! We had to change the plan and get to a &quot;less recommended&quot; site by the same guide (yes, the poor bears should return to the forests). It wasn't that bad but I can't compare, you see.<br />So please CONFIRM the places you are going in a map. You could get one (or take a look in an atlas) in a tourist information center or the like. Don't always trust the guide.<br />However, we got useful information from the guide, like a nice Youth Hostel that was not listed in a very good Japanese book of accomodations. In the guide you'll find the phone numbers and even the web page.<br />The maps have only the minimum information: you have to ask in the station about the time you need to get to every place, because not all the stations are drawn in the guide's maps.	2002-08-28

Por esto, puede considerarse un buen complemento del libro de Galeano.<br />El Manual está escrito en forma de tal, enunciando &quot;las reglas de conducta&quot; o &quot;las ideas que guían al idiota&quot;, y analiza cada una tras enunciarla: La critica, desmiente y rebate.<br />Dos propósitos importantes del libro son criticar duramente Las Venas y desmitificar personajes y &quot;hechos&quot;. Trata de hacerlo con sentido del humor, pero no todos los lectores estarán de acuerdo en esto. En algunos casos, el exceso de ironías no hace el texto divertido, sino confuso.<br />El Manual abarca temas como inversión extranjera, personajes históricos (Bolívar, el Che, Castro), aversión a Estados Unidos, teología de la liberación, autores extranjeros &quot;amigos del idiota latino&quot;, biblioteca del idiota y otros similares.<br />Un punto muy instructivo de este libro es su definición de posiciones y la explicación de las mismas: Fulanito dijo A porque le pasó/no le pasó B; Menganito dijo C e hizo D; Perenganito vio E y escribió F; etc.<br />El Manual es una obra interesante pero que, como todo libro de su clase, debe leerse con la cabeza fría, no menos que Las Venas.<br />Por supuesto, a cada lector le toca decidir sobre la veracidad de la información presentada en cada libro.	2002-08-26

In the first one you will read about the horror of a Nazi concentration camp, written by a person that was there, in the very place, not by a history teacher or a researcher. Some details are omitted, but nonetheless the text shows much of the life (if we can use such word) of the prisioners.<br />In the second part you will know about the psicology theory of the author. Even though the two parts of the book could be considered independent, after reading the first one you will understand how the theory introduced in the second part is developed.<br />You would agree or not with the theory itself, you could even say there is some advertisement, but this book will make you think on the subject anyway, on both such cruel facts and mental health.	2002-08-12

In general terms, this is a good book for intermediate and advanced Java programmers who need to work with images.<br />Just as the title reads, this is a Practical Introduction to digital image processing (DIP), that is, you will not find all the theory here, and the study of images will be mostly practical: with programs, what would be a good point or not, depending on you.<br />The CD is a very nice complement for the book, but a couple of programs just don't run as expected, and you might want to check the code to find the error or to use the code just as a reference to write your own Java classes. I have checked just part of the code and the problems do not seem a matter of deprecated classes or the like. You can find some errata searching in the Internet, but not much at time of this writing (June 2002). <br />You must read the book in front of your computer, to run the classes. The book sometimes doesn't tell you all about the classes available in the CD.<br />Always remember, the book tries to teach you DIP *using* Java, not DIP *and* Java. If you are not confident of your level of Java, try another book first. If you know about DIP and want to study further, try a book that is more specific on such subject.<br />This book is NOT for you if<BR>- you are a beginner in Java<BR>- you need to study DIP exhaustively<br />This book is for you if<BR>- you have experience programming in Java<BR>- you need basic and general concepts about DIP	2002-06-06

Highly recommended	The best thing about this book is that you don't need to have a major in math, computing, physics or chemistry to understand what codes are about. Not just that, but also to know how codes have been developed, evolutioned, and either been broken or still being a challenge.<br />This book shows you how codes (and ciphers) have been related to queens, treasures, religion, war, languages and much more. It gives you stories of fear, hope and will. This makes the reading very interesting. Have you wondered who was the Man in the Iron Mask?<br />You'll find a lot of references for further reading. The book is excellent as an introduction to codes and you'd want to read more about the subject; the book shows and explains to you the ways to take.<br />I didn't like some opinions from the author in the last chapter, but I do agree that there are many points of view about privacy, code breaking, and science, and these are continuosly changing. <br />You would finish the book agreeing or not; nontheless, you will know a lot more about codes, ciphers and writing systems.	2002-03-28

Maybe you use such stereotypes when talking about any topic on Japan. However, there are very good explanations for them, and I recommend you this book to know such basics.<br />In the first half, you'll read about Japan's history and the evolution of its society. In the second, you'll use those arguments to understand the behaviour of the groups of Japanese identified through the book.<br />The book set clearly two distinctions:<BR> 1. Talk about groups of Japanese, not \\"the Japanese,\\" that is, don't use stereotypes.<BR> 2. Consider the time. Any argument is valid only in a certain period of time.<br />On that second point, the book was edited in 2001. It has arguments for 2005 or so. After that, you should look for new arguments.	2002-03-20

However, this was absolutely not a problem to finish the book faster than I supposed at the beginning, because you can follow the story while learning &quot;you says&quot; and such expressions on-the-fly.<br />The story is very interesting, the characters are well defined and you do feel their emotions in the exciting parts of the saga.<br />After reading TLR, I went to The Hobbit, looking for more, but The Hobbit is not as good as TLR. I'll try The Silmarillion later.	2002-02-21

It has everything to enjoy a nice reading.<br />The situations are very descriptive not only of the 19th century's Brazil, but even of the present Brazilian culture (don't get me wrong, I don't mean the characters, but the interactions); the analysis of these situations goes into reflections about the humans (feelings, memories, decisions,...); the author even builds a well-driven relation between him and the readers, be them women, men, or specific people.<br />The one I read has notes from the editor that helps to understand more the author's &quot;intentions&quot; and the background of the novel itself.

Moreover, Spanish-like English is also used with or without warning: Call a fish &quot;he&quot;; the sea is &quot;she&quot; for those who love her, and &quot;he&quot; for those who see him as a rival.<br /> A dictionary might not be useful because some words are spelled as they are said colloquially, like &quot;salao&quot; for &quot;salado&quot; (unlucky).<br /> Get no frights, and be no bored.

It is. Or that the author shows a biased opinion. He does.<br />However, this is the other side of the history and the news: The data you won't get on &quot;official&quot; places (reports from the IMF, big news agencies or the like). Here you have the data about poverty, misery, betray, murder, famine,...<br />We could agree or not. The book is biased because the author decided to show the data in plain language: The book is well documented, but the information is not shown in simply numbers or graphs; instead, the author discusses the situations in the background of the numbers.<br />The book has been prohibited in some countries, but it is on its 73rd edition in Spanish (2001). The first edition is from 1970 and the revised one from 1978.

If you are going to travel abroad or you meet foreign people, you would like to know what these people understand from your body language. Of course, the book also gives you good material for chatting with friends from anywhere (including your own coutry).<br /> Don't expect the book to tell you what a gesture means in every part of the world or to show you every gesture used in some part of the world. The book of course doesn't do such a hard task, though it tries: it explains you the gestures that are generalized (or most common) in a country. However, be always aware that there are exceptions and gestures you should know and are not included in the book.<br /> Below are some questions you'll answer reading the book. In some cases the book gives you also the explanation about the gesture (what it comes from).<br /> Where should you avoid the &quot;OK sign&quot;?<BR> Where should a man enter before a woman?<BR> Why Latin people get closer to you when talking?<BR> How should you bow in Japan?	2001-11-20

It's a very good starting point. Moreover, I liked very much the political correctness of this book: The style is very respectful of cultures and people (in most cases).<br />Two problems: 1) It should include more countries. It would be a nice resource of data about the places the people you meet come from. 2) The information should be updated, let's say, in a web page, since the world changes continuosly.<br />However, you'll get a very nice picture about the places and people described in the book.	2001-10-04

For example, it doesn't cover MS Equation Editor (the one you use in Word). OK, I found interesting (and maybe useful later) info on handling formulae in Word and Excel, but not on editing equations.<br />I had found a solution for my problem before searching in the SE book, but I wanted a faster one (mine was somehow time-consuming). The book had nothing better to offer.<br />Moreover, even though this SE had the solution for other problems, it was difficult to find through the book.

It has detailed information on Windows registry, hardware updating, interface customizing and so on.<br /> Maybe one chapter is indispensable to read (the registry), but in most cases, you'll get directly the solution for your problem, without having to read a whole chapter; however, just read it as a textbook and you'll understand a lot about your system.<br /> Most tips and solutions work for the generic W9x (95, 98, 98 2Ed) and some even for W2000. Anyway, the book explains the differences (if any) between WME and the former.<br /> One recommendation: Try one solution or tip at a time, otherwise Windows will not let you know how well are you working.	2001-09-21

But you have also the CD ROM, which you'll love: The CD has all the words, pictures and pronunciations; the default setting is just nice but you can change it as you like.<br /> So far (about four months) I have found all the words I have searched and the different pronuntiations, if the case, for them.<br /> I'll say it again: it's an excellent choice.	2001-09-06

The summary is convenient for quick reference or reviewing.<br /> It will not help you to learn programming. It is a good complement for your favorite Java manual.	2001-07-19

The book works only with before-and-after examples.

It gives you a good explanation of why every thing works or why wouldn't, besides script examples, warnings on methods, advice on treating users and so on. Though there are some terms or even topics that seem out-of-date, you won't get lost.<br /> A lot of bibliography is introduced through the text, since this is just for starting: it doesn't cover each topic to the limit.<br /> This book is not for the user that just wants to know, say, how to make a symbolic link, but for any administrator and those users who want to understand their systems and get more from them.	2001-04-12

This could sound just good, but if you are not familiar with some topics, the text becomes somehow confusing and the you don't learn anything and, moreover, you could lose the main idea.<br /> As for conclusions, however, you get no universal truth, but only the author's thoughts (as you were warned at the beginning of the book). So, excepting those somehow unclear parts, the books is a nice source of social and scientific topics related to the research on how the mind works, very well introduced or explained.<br /> I expected more from the last chapter, The Meaning of Life. It started gathering some previous parts and it seemed good for conclusions, but indeed the analysis on &quot;mind working&quot; just continued.<br /> As a simple comment, some sections of the book are for US readers or people that know well geography, history, movies and other topics of the US.	2001-03-30
