But I figured: There HAS to be a reason why  this book got the award, so I atempted to read this again, and was NOT  dissapointed.<br />Catherine, Called Birdy is a powerful and true novel about  the trials and tribulations of a female in the midieval ages trying to  understand her abominable brother, her best friend's lover for her brother,  why her mother fell for her rat-like father, and over all trying to run  away from her fate of marrying a rich 60 year old stinky lord who, worst of  all, has a son her age!  <br />The whole book was hilariously funny, this  diary of Lady Birdy, is a great historical fiction, and I can not doubt why  this original book got the prestigeous award it earned.	1999-01-17

Yes, Hoffman's unusual and original prose style may leave you straying off to the more traditional ways of prose, but it's just fantastic and touching to read if you TRY to  enjoy the magnificence of her depicted words and odd metaphores.  The first  few pages is full of details of the earth, quite unnessesary really, but  when you start chapter 2, you'll be hooked.  <br />This book has all the  twists, turns, adultry, and trashiness of a Danielle Steel or Stephen King,  but there's also the elegance and structure of a Ernest Hemingway, Leo  Tolstoy, or even the difficulty of grasping the human ways of  thinking-psychology- like that of Fyodor Dostoevsky.  <br />But what most  readers need to understand is that in this book, you have to look below the  surface, and there you will find the true meanings of the actions, and  emotions that take place in this great modern fiction.	1999-01-17

The beginning was  gripping, you kept wondering if they'd make it...the only bad thing about  this book was that the &quot;quizel&quot; the bird in other words was a  corny element and should have been left out.  Other than that, this book  was fantastic and should be read by all at one point of their lives when  stressed and searching for self understanding.	1999-01-08

She lived such a harsh  life, beaten into marriage, hanged to death for following her parents  wishes, queen for 7 days, this girl deserves much more respect (and pages)  than she was given!

It was pitiful to see how this little 16 year old was over shadowed by her hated cousin Mary I and her other powerful and beloved cousin Elizabeth I.  I have been searching far and wide for a book on this fasination female,  hanged to death at such a tender age...beated by parent to marry at  14...sad thing is that there is no surviving picture of this strong headed  intelligent being...she only survives in ones who give her the spotlight  she hid from so long ago when she was alive.  This fabulous and colorful  nonfiction will break the hearts of the average human on earth, including  teenagers.  <br />Just like Anne Frank, Jane Grey was a female foresaken and  taken for granted, this girl lived far more long ago in history, in a world  we will never be able to comprehend or understand.

Yes, they were pretty good, emphasis on the pretty, but they lacked in depth.  I had a hoot reading all the reviews of this  book-yes, I read all 100+.  Seems to me that Amazon should start reading  the reviews more carefully, this site is turning into a message board where  everything personal comes in.  What sensible book buyer wants to hear for  the 100th time &quot;The best book I have ever read&quot;?<br />Another  point: sadly I'll have to admit the bunny theme was rather lame.  This is a  book that only reaches out to younger children, and are still loved by  those same children in about 50 more years.  This isn't the type of book  written with enough action and plot to make the average adult want to read  a book about rabbits.<br />I wouldn't call this &quot;the best book in the  world&quot; or &quot;my favorite book of all time&quot;, the writing level  was too simple...same on the level of Beauty by Robin Mckinley...even Green  Eggs &amp; Ham had more meaning and thoughts to it.<br />Overall, I am  saying that elementry kids may enjoy this childish and lowly book, but  readers who are up to more challenges should find another book more  difficult, if not more engaging.  Some George Eliot and Thomas Hardy should  do the trick!	1999-01-05

My interest in Geishas started with Goldbloom's THE MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA, and after reading that book, I went out and searched for as much information  and books on geishas I could find.  Snow Country is a different kind of  love, compared to what you find in other books, this one is of a new and  fresh experience, dried out after the marriage type of love.  Very  refreshing to read, I found this book to be less complicated as MEMOIRS OF  A GEISHA, but just as heartbreaking.	1998-12-31

Gratefully, Sinclair Lewis went ahead and did that, causing a novel some  hate because of the mean and narrowminded female, and some love for her  being so naive.  <br />Her neighbors shunned her for being so fashionable and  modern, and their husbands bashfully talked about her bare ankles, which  causes stirrs in those days.  This book takes you back into time, where  modesty was the policy, and if you didn't follow it, you need be prepared.

I was surprised to find this book to be much better than I had expected it to be.  Being an anti-short story book lover, I unwillingly bought this book, only because it was by my favorite fantasy author.  Maybe it was just  the author, but the stories were humerous, twisted with evil, and with a  light gleam of romance.  Weary of short stories?  Then read this book.	1998-12-26

I got confused with the dark and light ages, and all those other science fiction things that I an ignorant of, did not understand.  But the second time, I took my time  and grasped this touching story of life and death, the search for a girl  who's love was so strong for her father, that she risked her lives and  friends to bring him back.

I don't really recommend this, because the plot goes too quickly.  Chapter to chapter is a new topic, no chance to ponder or think about what happened.  Not written well either,  nothing that was done connected or made sense in the end.  Must have been  thrown together by the author for a quick sequel.  I didn't find this  satisfying, so maybe you should just read THE GOLDEN COMPASS again.	1998-12-07

A mother who runsaway one day, leaving a teenaged sister, uninterested in clothes and boys, to take care of her siblings, with the  help of an old neighbor.  The hardest part is pretending that your mother  is still home, and all is well.  Death and family problems are hidden in  this book. <br /> This book just shows why marriage should happen before kids,  especially if your a teenager, you won't beable to live a life if you have  so many kids, as this mother did, and was psychologically disterbed because  of her early childbirths.	1998-12-07

The writing style was rather dull, not my type of thing.   Overall, if you like a little fantasy and sci-fi in a high school setting,  you may want to read this.

Another Rinadi historical fiction.  This is a very tedious and winding novel that just shows that Rinaldi is running out of time  periods out of history.  I thoroughly enjoyed her WOLF BY THE EARS, and  COLONIAL AMERICA stories, but this book was just to rediculous.  Maybe Ann  Rinaldi should consider trying to act out the lives of people in Europe  (Elizabeth I, Lady Jane Grey, Ann Boleyn) and drop the whole American  theme.  <br />I'd give this book 1 star because of it's weak content and  obvious historical remarks, but threw in an extra star because Ann Rinaldi  is one of the best historical writers I have ever come across.  If you're a  new Rinaldi reader, try her other more great works, but if you have read  all her other novels, just might as well read this one.	1998-11-29

The High Queen was the  melodrama of a son falling in love with the suppposedly &quot;High&quot;  Queen.  I still have no idea why this book was titled &quot;THE HIGH  QUEEN&quot; there was no significance to her power  (she didn't have much)  or rank (pretty high,though reputable ruined to being with).<br />Hmm, don't  know... maybe it's because I couldn't feel the son's love for the Queen, or  the Queen's love for her husband, or the husband's love for...well, you get  the point.  Emotions and feelings are poorly played out in this book, a  negative thing to read.	1998-11-01

But out of all of those  titles and many more, I found THE AWAKENING to be a very highly difficult  book to read and grasp it's understanding.  I had to read this book twice  to figure out the main plot, and in it, there are plenty of subplots, which  means I'll most likely have to read THE AWAKENING again to figure out.  Though overall, the story of a woman who can relate to Flaubert's MADAME  BOVARY and Hardy's TESS DURBERVILLE, is an enjoyable one.	1998-11-01
