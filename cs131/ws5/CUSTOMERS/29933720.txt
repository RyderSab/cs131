Aunt <BR>Dew is 100 years old and as proof she has a box, which she calls the \\"Hundred Penny Box\\" <BR>which contains her collection of 100 pennies.

Issues of abandonment, divorce, and being biracial are also discussed within the book.  I highly recommend this novel to children and young adults as an eye opener about homelessness and poverty.

In the book, Waiting for Christopher, the main character, Feena Harvey, a high school student who doesn't quite fit in, decides to act.  She sees a young boy named Christopher being physically and emotionally abused by his mother.  When Christopher's mother seemingly abandons the young toddler in the parking lot of a small amusement park, Feena doesn't consider the shades of gray or what can happen to her, she acts.  Feena \\"kidnaps\\" Christopher and begins to secretly take care of him.  Feena immediately recognizes that this young boy shares the name of her deceased brother, whom, she has never been able to grieve for.  <br />Feena has never had many friends, and books are her constant companion, but after a mishap involving a young, popular, African American student in her school, Raylene, she thinks she may have met someone that shares her love for reading.  After finding Raylene's copy of a book by Zora Neale Hurston, Feena decides keeping the book and reading it will be much less embarrassing than trying to return it.  After kidnapping Christopher, Raylene and Feena form an unlikely bond of friendship and the two young teens try to care for the boy as best they can and protect him from his mother.<br />This is an emotional book that really sheds light on some of the complexities of child abuse and neglect.  It was about two brave girls who made countless sacrifices to protect a child that they felt adults would not.  It is also a story about friendship, as the two get to know each other they learn that in spite of their cultural differences they share a lot in common.

She and her best friends, Cher and Tamika, will be attending a brand new middle school, and she is sure that things will be great.  She soon discovers things are nothing like she expected.  Tamika moves away, and when Penny tries out for cheerleading with Cher, she is rejected because she is overweight.  To add to her misery, she is made the team mascot and is teased by all.  Penny becomes depressed and deals with her depression by binge eating, which makes her even more overweight and puts her health in jeopardy.  <br />LOVING PENNY allows the reader a glimpse into the psyche of an overweight young girl.  The book describes the cycle of being depressed because of obesity and overeating because of depression.  Yet, the book shows the strength that Penny exhibits to gain self-esteem and to learn to love herself.  I was also impressed with the approach used for Pennys transformation and by the recipes included.  Diane Dorce has done an excellent job describing Penny and the anguish she experiences.  I recommend this book to all preteens, so that they can see how harmful bullying and name-calling can be.  This book may also be especially helpful to those who may be overweight or have other issues with their self-esteem.	2003-06-27

However, the prominent role this sport has played in the African <BR>American community is often overlooked.  The Negro Leagues gave African American athletes <BR>the opportunity to both display their talents and earn a living.  In addition, the Negro <BR>Leagues provided all African Americans with a social outlet and heroes of their own.  As <BR>African American athletes such as Jackie Robinson began to integrate into the Major <BR>Leagues, the vitality and ultimate survival of the Negro Leagues was threatened.  <br />Through The Journal of Biddy Owens, Myers deftly teaches children about this y time of transition<BR>in the history of the Negro Leagues.

Granddaddy's Gift highlights one aspect of American history, the African American struggle for the right to vote.  The stars of this touching story are Joe Morgan and his granddaughter whom he calls \\"Daughter\\" but everyone else in their community affectionately calls \\"Little Joe\\" because she is like his shadow.  Joe Morgan is a man that has worked hard all his life and in spite of his 8th grade education, he owns his own land on which he farms and raises animals.  He stresses the importance of education to his granddaughter through both his words and actions.  When it comes time for someone in their Mississippi community to stand up and attempt to register to vote, Joe Morgan answers the call.  As a result of his decision he, his family and ultimately the entire African American community are faced with adversity, but in the process he teaches his granddaughter some important lessons.<br />Granddaddy's Gift illustrates how the freedoms that many of us take for granted are indeed a gift from the generations before us.

In BECAUSE YOU'RE LUCKY, she introduces us to Kevin who has come to stay with his cousin's family empty-handed.  His cousin Jonathon gives him a hard time from the very beginning because he doesn't like that he has to share everything with Kevin, so he lashes out at Kevin and questions his mother.  She teaches him that families are always there for each other and \\"lucky\\" to be able to learn new things about each other.<br />This is a simple book with nice illustrations, however, I wasn't too sure I liked the title of the book.  Children may get the impression that getting their basic needs met is a matter of luck vs the intended message, which I interpreted as Jonathon being lucky because he had Kevin as a cousin and a friend. Additionally, I felt the book left a few areas open that should have been addressed; specifically the relationship Kevin had with his older cousin Dawn.<br />Reviewed by Tee C.

Isra is young, but wants to play with her older sisters and wants to leave Butterfly Land so that she can venture out into the outside world.  Warned by her mother and under the supervision of her sisters, she's still convinced that she can move her wings quickly enough to escape any danger.  Unfortunately, she's not as quick as she believes and is caught and taken to Show and Tell.<br />Young-Robinson has given us a careful blend of adventure for the children as well as lessons on obeying parents.  I loved this book and would definitely recommend it to others.  Finley's illustrations are an added bonus to this book and beautifully portray Isra, her family, and the children in the outside world.<br />Reviewed by Tee C. Royal...	2003-06-12

However, the prominent role this sport has played in the African American community is often overlooked.  The Negro Leagues gave African American athletes the opportunity to both display their talents and earn a living.  In addition, the Negro Leagues provided all African Americans with a social outlet and heroes of their own.  As African American athletes such as Jackie Robinson began to integrate into the Major Leagues, the vitality and ultimate survival of the Negro Leagues was threatened.  <br />Through The Journal of Biddy Owens, Myers deftly teaches children about this y time of transition in the history of the Negro Leagues.  Through the fictional journal entries of  seventeen year old Biddy, an equipment manager for the Birmingham Black Barons, readers are immediately drawn into the world of baseball.  Children are not only exposed to historical <BR>information about baseball and the Negro leagues, but also about segregation, racism and other aspects of the social climate in the 1940's.  The final chapter of the book provides a brief historical overview of life in 1948 for children like Biddy, while reinforcing the history lessons laced throughout the book.  This book is a must for children who love baseball, but will be enjoyed by all.<br />Reviewed by Stacey Seay<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-12

The book shows a series of handsome, yet funny cartoon caricatures of LL Cool J being egotistical when winning and being down and depressed when he loses. He then tells the moral; regardless of whether you win or lose, having the right attitude makes you a winner every time. The books comes with a compact disc that has LL Cool J rapping the words of the story and encouraging kids to never give up. <br />This is an excellent book that I would highly recommend for children. It uses a popular entertainer to present a very valuable lesson. Kids will enjoy the compact disc that allows younger readers to follow the story while older readers will enjoy the opportunity to read/rap along.<br />Reviewed by Latoya Carter-Qawiyy<BR>of The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers	2003-06-12
