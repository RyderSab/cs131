While it has a great start and a killer villain.  However, once Tazi leaves Sembia the story goes from great to mediocre.  A once greatly malicious villain turns into your average nasty schmoe and the novle just degenerates into a standard hack and slash unbtil you get to the end of the story type book.<br />While not bad, this is definately the low point in the Sembian series, which means it is still good, just not as good as the rest of them.	2003-04-10

While, obstensibly, it is about Duece, the firstborn son of Thamalon Uskerven it actually involves the entire Usk family.  <br />LOS neatly wraps up the Sembian series and sets up a new novel that will be released in 2004!  While some things are left unfinished as there are new series coming out involving Erevis Cale and Tazi, so if you are looking for closure with them forget it!  As for Thamalon the elder, Shamur, Tamlin, and Talbot we do see completion.<br />The book also brings back some old characters from Gross's earlier Sembian novel, Radu and Chaney.  Centering on the evils of the Hulourn and Drakkar and a fiendish plot to eliminate the heads of the merchant houses.  There are plenty of evil murders to go around as well as a mystery involving Tamlin.<br />The tale is paced quite nicely, and just when you get involved in one portion of the tale you are swept into another.  This book is a definate improvement over Gross's previous novel BLACK WOLF.  While Wolf was good, this novel really does what it sets out to do, and manages to entertain all the way through.	2003-04-10

As the final book in the Empires trilogy, this book was meant to be the big showdown in which Yuman and Azoun complete the conflict in a spectacular battle. At least, that is what I expected.  It is what should have happened.  In each of the previous novels, the Khahan (intent on conquering all of Toril) cuts a swathe across the face of the faerun.  By the second book we are treated to a nice series of battles, and a big build up for the showdown with the western forces.<br />INstead, what you get is 200 pages of build up to the final campaign.  The entire book is made up of Azoun trying to gather an army together to stop the Tuigan horde, which while interesting, was not exactly fast paced.  I think the same effect could have been accomplished with 100 pages.  I really wanted a massive conflict, and was treated to a meager campaign.  The showdown between Yamun and Azouns was likewise a letdown, it was intensely brief, and for all of the build up to how great a fighter the Khahan was he came across as little more than an average fighter.<br />The one good thing about this book is that you get to learn the final fate of characters from the 1st two books, with the exception of Chanar (unless I seriously missed something).  <br />This book isn't terrible, but it doesn't live up to the other books in the series.  Of course, if you have read the other 2 novels then this is a must read, just so you can find out what happened.  If you haven't then skip it, you'll only be disappointed.	2003-03-22

The second book in the Empires trilogy, it completely avoids the &quot;middle book syndrome&quot;.  Most 2nd novels in a trilogy are about nothing and contain a whollllllle lot of travel, but this book is a very personal tale.  <br />Batu is a general in the Shou army who is charged with stopping the Tuigan invaders.  His wife is left behind to deal with the court.  Out of these 2 simple plot devices a fascinating tale unfolds.<br />Without revealing anything I will say this, the novel is a very personal journey by Batu as he tries to deal with the invaders.  The pleasant thing about this tale is the unexpected twists it takes.  What you expect at the beginning of this story is not what you get at the end.  Being that it is the 2nd book in a trilogy there are some things that you know MUST happen, such as the Tuigans continuing on to battle Cormtyr in the 3rd novel.  This does not mean that a very powerful battle does not occur.  It is the results of the battle and its fallout that are surprising.<br />All of the characters are interesting, and seem like real people.  In fact, it is the honest portrayals that make this such a good book.  After everything that Batu goes through his responses seem real, not as if they were manipulated to fit an outline.  <br />It was further enhanced by the appearance of characters from the 1st novel, who come across as true to their portrayals in Horselords.  <br />If you want a really good story with action and personality read Dragonwall.	2003-03-13

This is an excellent novel, with only a few faults.  The main gripe I have with the book is that it is truly a series of short stories, but is treated like a novel.  What I mean to say is that there is no table of content that allows you to easily jump one from story of interest without having to scan through the entire book.  The tales need not be read in order at all, and yet you are expected to do so.<BR>   <BR>   Each story centers on one member of the Uskevren house, starting with the Patriarch all the way down to the maid.  Each of these people seem to have some special quality about them, and their secrets are kept close to their breasts.  Sometimes, it seems that there is a reason that each person is so special or has so deep and dark a secret.  Clearly, there is more to this family than is initially let on, and only further tales will reveal what is so special about them.<br />   In case you did not know, the shorts in this book are but  preludes to the other novels in the series, they are basically the set up tales that get you interested, but really give you no completion.  Many things are left unsettled by the end of this book.<br />    The only downfall I can really see, and it has nothing to do with this novel in and of itself, is that the final book that was to be penned by Greenwood has been canceled.  I would love to see another anthology of tales to close out the series.<br />    Of them all, the Best tales deal with the matriarch, the butler, the maid, the daughter, and the second son.  The Patriarch's tale is informitive, but dry and the heir's story has plenty of drama, but no depth.  Two out of seven aint bad!  Besides, they are still decent tales.  <br />   Warning:  If you buy this book you will have to pick up the rest of the series!	2003-03-08

While not a bad book, this could have been placed into practically any fantasy setting and it would have altered very little.  The Princess and her suitor are entertaining, but the rest of the book is flat. The one item of interest is the suiotr's abilty to just create incredible items that work without the need of magic.  It is interesting to see modern warfare in a fantasy book, but at the same time a little disconcerting.  Give it a read if you want something really out of the ordinary.	2003-01-31

Zaranda is a little bit too perfect, but over all the book really only had 2 flaws.  The first is the traitor.  I knew who it was before it was even going to be an issue that there was an inkling of a possible traitor existing.  The other is the rather overwhelming neglect of one of the best possible secondary characters in all the FR.  The Orcish paladin, Shield of Innocence, is really little more than a name who beheads people.  I would have liked to have seen more of him as he was portrayed in the last coupla chapters.  Otherwise a decent novel.	2003-01-31

What I will say is that Brooks has woven a true masterpiece full of surprises, excitement, danger, and magic.  Others have compared his books to Tolkien, but I think that as of this novel he completely goes beyond JRR.  There are few novels of any kind that I have read as often as this book.  I read it at least once a year, and have been since it was first published.  His other novel Wishsong is not half as good by far, but then this is a truly great novel.  Read This Book!	2003-01-18

Elfstones was incredibly paced and wrought with excitement.  Sword, which is refrenced several times in Elfstones, really begins at a plodding pace.  The book is slow beyond words and shows no signs of picking up the pace.  I was seriously disappointed after I started reading it.  In fact I actually put the novel down for a year before going back and trying to get through it.  Once you get beyond the half way point things do pick up, they do become exciting, and it all becomes worthwhile.  It just takes a little too long to do so.  At 700 + pages I really want a tale, what you get is a primer for the tales to come. In truth, that is probably what made the Elfstones so fun, the world was fleshed out and Brooks had a plan.  Read this more as an afterthought, get Elfstones first and then move into the rest of the series.  You will get more out of the Sword in that manner.	2003-01-18

It is set in a harsh unforgiving world that is slowly dying, and while you have the impression that they inhabitants of this world are doomed, they do not.  In fact, there is a sense of optimism pervasive in each character, although it might not be readily evident.  For a first book in a new setting this tale does well to both describe the land, the cultures, and still manages to entertain.  I read this while riding to Florida and it really passed the time quickly.  I barely noticed that I was in a car.

The only reason that this book gets 4 stars rather thatn 5 is beacause it really doesn't focus on Talbot, the hero, as much as it should have.  Otherwise, that is the only flaw.  <br />This book gives some really good insight into the god Malar, even though he never appears.  If you have read Jewels of the Turmish (if not please don't) Malar is quite poorly portrayed.  In JotT he creates undead to fight his battles, which is hard to swallow since he is a god of the forest/hunt.  Werewolves really fit well into hius philosophies and for the first time I think Dave Gross nailed this semi-evil god right on.  The goddess Selune is also discussed, but not quite as much, but enough to get an idea of her powers in the realms.<br />There is some great characterization, the villains are excellent and the poor schmoe Darrow is the perfect anitithesis to Talbot.  The secondary characters are engaging (notably Quickly and the High Cleric of Selune) as well.  I hope Gross will crank out another gem like this soon.  This is the first Sembia book I have read, and I will make certain to read the others.	2003-01-17

He has great characters, and then proceeds to kill them at an alarming rate (though you never suspect when it will happen).  The deaths make the tale all the more beleivable.  I hate reading a book where characters facing overwhelming odds and no one dies.  The best part about this book is the way Lowder breaks from the Ravenloft tradition and does something unbelievable with Soth (although I think the tale was a command performance by DL editors!).  You will love the Bloody Cobbler, although you will realize who the White Rose is early on if you are any kind of DL fan.  Read this book!

It kind off avoided all of my expectations (which I had gotten from a review in Dragon Magazine).  It had nice characters, but then it really played out exactly the way you thought it would.  That kind of balanced it all out.  It was a nice, but ultimately forgetable book.<BR>   But then I looked at it in a different way.  After I pondered it, it hit me that this tale was very nearly a perfect replica of old tales of myth.  Once I looked at it in that light I appreciated it a bit more.  The tale is well crafted, and if it were sent back in time to compete with Beowulf I doubt we'd ever spot its modern roots.<BR>    That said, there are flaws. The most poignant of which is the fact that the &quot;hero&quot; of the tale is not the one doing all of what he is supposed to do.  He gets all the credit while his companions do the work.  <BR>   A man from our world (a Scipling) is decieved into entering the world of the Alfar (a land of magic) to retrieve a sword, mend a broken pentacle, and get a mystic grindstone in order to lift a curse and free the day people.  To do so he must pose as the man who brought this plague of misery onto the day people.  The viking reluctantly agrees to help, and eventually gets drawn into the action and desires to help.  Liefr is the everyman of the tale, who is really a brave warrior, but it is his &quot;relative&quot; Thurid who does all the work of the novel.  Read it, you'll see what I mean.  This is a good starting point.	2003-01-15

Ok, this isn't the best novel in the series, but it also isn't the worst by far.  ...<br />   NoM is a tale that anyone who has read any of the other Ethshar novels has been waiting to get their hands on.  It is the tale of what happens on the night Warlockery is iontorduced into the world.  As such, it is kind of rigid in what it can and cannot do.  It COULD show how people reacted when they first became warlocks, how rulers and wizards worried over the new magic, and show how the Council of Warlocks came into being complete with how all their laws and rules came about.  It simply could NOT tell us what caused warlockery to occur, since earlier novels (which take place much later after the night of madness)left the whole event shrouded in mystery.  LWE couldn't reveal what caused the event or why it happened, but he did reveal some tantalizing clues, which if you gather tidbits from other novels in the series gives you a better (if somewhat lacking) idea of what is going on.  <br />In usual LWE fasion the protagonist makes out by not being greedy or power hungry, so there is no surprises there.

You remember, the dead rise for mysterious reasons, they eat the living, people struggle to survive, etc, etc.  That's about how this tale goes too, all motions no depth.  I really got the impression that this was planned on being a 2 parter, or maybe even a trilogy, considering that the ending was rather abrupt and without much resolve.  I won't say what happens to the undead, or the humans for that matter, but it is pretty predictable once things get going.  I'm sure that this could have been better.  I'm actually giving a star higher than I normally would since this was his first novel, and I try to support anything that has to do with zombies.

While in the process of cataloging my library I decided to read anything on my shelf that I had overlooked before.  Having read the reviews here before I started I have to say that I was very disappointed.  The book tends to expound upon useless details like where razors and coffe pots came from, and had primarily one dimensional characters.  The title had me clued in to expecting a run of the mill vamp in Moscow.  The novel, however, sets you up to expect the antichrist, a being of pure evil and unbelievable power that rises once every thousand years.  That really got me going, until you ended up getting a pretty basic non-antichrist-like vampire.  For me, there was no suspense, the action was very few and far between.  Overall, I'd have to praise the book for how detailed it is in it's portrayal of Soviet life, but that's all.  The book wasn't scary or suspensful in the slightest.  Look somewhere else for a good vampire book.	2002-12-14

I realize that this is his most beloved Ethshar novel, but I could barely get through this book both times I read it.  I read it twice just to make sure I didn't gloss over some deeper hidden meaning.  I didn't.  This book  is about a journey.  A rather loooooong one.

Adam is interesting, the two \\"heroes\\" are not.  The good doctor has some interesting points, but rather than expand upon them the author sort of drifts about between the monster and the doctor telling their tale intersprsed with the action.  Thus the book starts out in third person, goes to first, then back to third, and then back to first, then back to third.  It makes for disjointed reading.  The 2 necromancers are boring.  This book is not distinctive enough to set it apart from its source material.  Mordenhiem is not particularly evil either, he is more indifferent than he is evil.  His biggest crime is being self absorbed.  Check out the original tale, skip this version.	2002-12-11

I found Parched Sea to be entertaing enough that I read VD immediately after, and I was really disappointed.  The main character, Ruha, was left of in Parhed Sea, having finally found her place in her tribe, in VD she has left her tribe to become a Harper with little to no explanation.  The Shou are treated as though they had the language skills of a monkey.  Were I Asian I would be very upset.  Basically, this story could have had anyone in Ruha's place and it would have been the same tale.	2002-12-11
