Read for Judy Christenberry, but forwarned :-(	I have loved all of the books by Judy Christenberry.<br /><br />So, I am sad to say that this book is by far her worst that I have read.<br /><br />The summary is that Hank Brownlee and his father Carl are living on the family ranch after having lost Carl's wife the year before.<br /><br />Hank decides that it would be good to hire a housekeeper to not only keep up his house and give him the good homecooked meals he has been without, but to see if his father Carl would take to the *mature* housekeeper and make Carl more interested in life.<br /><br />He hires Maggie from her picture of her with her daughter and grandson.<br /><br />However, when Hank returns from his week of hard work at his friend's ranch he discovers Carl playing with Timmy and that Maggie is the daughter (actually niece of the older lady in the picture.  Hank becomes livid and explodes at this and demands that she leave that minute.  Timmy is scared and about to cry as Maggie starts to pack their bags.

Having read all of Mindy Neff's book in her popular series I was a bit disappointed with this one.<br /><br />A few reasons.<br />It is hard to really explain that the character wasn't as likeable as her previous characters had been.<br /><br />Grant (male character who was in her previous books and was liked in those as a secondary character) came off as a jerk at the start.<br />Abbe Shea (the female character) can't understand WHY he is upset that she came to his place on false pretenses. Not to mention that their is a price on her head and she didn't CARE that she was subjecting others to murderers.<br />There wasn't that chemistry between her male and female character that she had in her previous Shotgun Ridge books (which I have them all).<br />In her previous books the love making was not as graphic as this one was.  I really was disappointed to see her talk about her [...] and a few other seens.  If I knew it would be that smutty I wouldn't have bought this book.<br /><br />The Pop (her adoptive father and Grant's biological father) in the book is a thug.<br />Sorry, he was too coward to get out of a criminal family.<br />Yet, we should all love him?<br />Why for having people killed?<br />Laudering money?<br />Being in the Mafia?<br /><br />Grant gets shot in the shoulder and passes out?<br />Then an hour later he is heading a mission AFTER he passes out, takes Abbe's daughter to the medicine doctor (he passes out but can drive) and is doctored by the medicine doctor, then leads a group of ex-Army men to rescue Abbe.<br />It doesn't add up and neither does this book.<br /><br />It gets ONLY three stars because<br />this is a book in her Shotgun Ridge Series (I love the previous 6 stories and 1 online Shotgun Ridge story), because she does have some of her characters back in the mix and that she sends a message that her next story might just be Clay going after Cherry Peyton (Wyatt's neighbor from the first story).	2004-12-06

Why this was probably my least favorite out of the Dark Series, I hope that Ms Feehan continues with this series as well as her others.<br /><br />It was different to have a female survive having been turned by a vampire and surviving without losing her mind.<br /><br />However, Destiny's character just seemed to get annoying at times.  I don't know if there was a reason for that, but it does seem like quite a few others felt that way as well.<br /><br />I like how their is more to this story than Destiny & Nicholas coming together.<br /><br />Subplots and leading into new characters is something Ms. Feehan does well.<br /><br />We all know that that the Vampires are banding together and that Morrison Research has something to do with this.<br /><br />Nicholas's brother finding his potential lifemate....<br /><br />I can't wait for his story.<br /><br />The first time a female lifemate sees her lifemate (who has turned vampire).<br /><br />That was awesome.<br /><br />So, Destiny's character was weak and complained, but I have to say with the rest of it that it came together in the middle & end of the book.	2004-08-09

I read an interview with Lowell where she said that she gets paid to write from the Publisher and that what they get is what they want.    I thought it was what the READERS want!    She remarked on this book in particular.    She admitted that she never quite finished Eric the Learned's story.  Which IF you have read Forbidden or Enchanted then you realize he was one of the main characters in both.  This book tries to tie the ancient medieval warrior/sorcer to the modern day.  Sadly to those who bought this thinking that this had any thing to do with her previous characters there is very LITTLE of the past.    Then she goes on to say something about people get too attached to characters and seemed to mock some of the people who were so hung up on her characters that she created in her past books.  To her it is easy to let go since she writes what the publisher wants her to write.    Shame on her.    I haven't bought a book of hers since that interview.  I had bought this book thinking (being misled) it had to do with her medieval charcters as the back cover indicated it did.    Fine that you don't get into the characters that YOU create.

She introduces characters &amp; gives them history in other books when she does her series...  But, not to confuse you if you don't read them in order.  MMMM like Enchanted Series...  In all her series she does this.  This gives you a chance to connect with  the characters.  I want Luke &amp; Mariahs' cousins to be introduced.  Also, if you read Reckless Love you will meet their ancestors.  Like Case.  I don't think anyone does a great job like Ms Lowell does in a series  writing.  She draws you in.  I am waiting for Utahs' story as well as the  elusive cousins(female).	2000-03-24

I just wanted to make the comment on the audio.  I decided for the first time to buy one of them.  I came upon it by accident &amp; I had just finished rereading it like a week  before.  The audio skipped some parts of the book.  Then it is hard to  really get into it when you have a female narrator trying to do a mans  voice.  It just didn't over on that aspect.  However, this in no way  reflects on Ms Lowell.  I simply love her work.	2000-03-24

Their characters exude sensuality.  She also includes other characters rather than making it only about them.  In her previous books in the series she  also includes her characters, but even if you don't read them in order it  will not confuse you.  She introduced Eric &amp; I am waiting for his book  with Serena...  Then maybe one about Sven he is mysterious.  You get drawn  in &amp; she leaves you wanting more.  Ms Lowell is simply a divine writer  who has class not crass in her writing style.  I just wish I didn't have to  wait soooo long for her other books.	2000-03-24
