The book is centered more on Judaism than about Buddhism, and covers issues such as the principles of Kabbalah in an authentic, nontrendy form and how it fits into mainstream Judaism; the commonalities and differences between Jewish and Buddhist views of the world; the failures of current Jewish religious education, and the effects of the Holocaust on modern Judaism (not just the people killed, but ho it has changed the focus of the religion). It addresses some of the same concerns about assimilation as Anne Roiphe's Generation Without Memory, but by contrasting Judaism to Buddhism and examining some of the people who are in a spectrum between the two (\\"JuBus\\") comes closer to finding some answers.	2005-06-22

In some ways the selection for the '84 Olympics was a crux point in the US rowing system, and Halberstam shows just why. If you want to get a view into a sport most people ignore, written by a top author, this is a good place to do it - same if you just want a peek in the mind of world-class athletes. If you want to really learn about the 84' Olympics selection camp, I'd recommend reading this in combination with Brad Lewis' \\"Assault at Lake Casitas\\", for a another viewpoint from one of the main actors (and the '84 doubles gold medalist).  <br /> <br />Incidentally, the movie Rowing Through was based on The Amateurs. It's quite divergent from the book, but not too bad if you can ignore a good bit of gratuitous sex and some hardly-Olympic-caliber rowing in the scenes on the water.	2005-01-20
US	52552766	R11T41EVOXK7IH	0812562615	893400079	Freedom & Necessity	Books	5	31	32	N	N	Brilliant, but not for all tastes	I note that most of the reviewers who gave this low ratings begin with &quot;Epistolary novels are boring&quot; or &quot;I don't like Victorian settings&quot;. So look: this is a story told through letters and journal entries and it is set in the mid-1800s. Got that? If you can't stand either of those, this may not be the book for you. It also delves into philosophy (hence the title) and the politics of the time, and by the way it contains the best love letter *ever* and the best romance story since Dorothy Sayers' Gaudy Night. There are a few loose ends that could have been better tied up, and I really wish Bull and Brust had done a better job with the alternate universe subplot; as another reviewer has pointed out, the Golden Bough-type myths are hinted at but it is never clear whether there's anything to them in the world of the story, or whether Kitty's experiments are anything more than hallucinations. The story is not weakened if the magic some characters believe in is mythical, but a bit more exposition would be nice. Otherwise, just brilliant.	2004-03-25

It is nice to see John's stories in a binding befitting their quality, though. (One tiny niggle: I sort of wish they'd used silver instead of gilt on the cover of this one.)

I originally gave it three stars for the photos, which are worth looking at, but the text it pretty awful -- a serious drawback in a book aimed at compulsive book collectors. I took off one whole star specifically for a line that says something like, \\"It doesn't matter if books access is difficult, as long as it isn't completely impossible.\\" Doesn't matter to whom? It does to this reader. I reread. I browse nostalgic favorites. I like to handle my books, and I need to be able to get to them. Also, a substantial number of the storage systems shown appear to be concerned more with style than with storage -- I didn't mind the coffee table constructed of books layered with glass, as those were old design catalogs and the whole was sort of a pun, but the grid system and a few other types of shelves that only contained a book or two here and there as placed by a decorator is really not my idea of living with books. Get this if you want pretty pictures. If you're really interested in books themselves and how they are stored, try Henry Petroski's The Book and the Bookshelf instead.	2004-01-26

I had to buy the second edition a few years ago because my original copy was falling apart, quite literally. (But I still have it; couldn't bear to throw it away.) The second ed adds a much-needed songwriter index.<br />You couldn't play the songs in this book if you don't already know the tune, since only chords are listed for most songs. On the other hand I can't open to any page without finding songs I know (and usually, love). Many of these are songs you won't find in other songbooks. All are singable. Included songs run the gamut of folk music (and that includes trad, Celtic and other ethnicities, folk-rock, singer-songwriter, and on and on) as well as Motown, Tin Pan Alley, a few showtunes, and more.

Hambly is one of those, and five books in, Ben January has lost none of his thoughtful carefulness. As a previous reviewer has remarked, Hambly is not known for making her characters' lives easy, but Ben's is just far enough from desperation to keep him from lapsing into sodden unthinking despair, while keeping him always tuned to the dangers in a rapidly changing city. The end seems a wee bit unlikeyl (I'm not there yet; I peeped) but I think it may be the only way Hambly could take her characters where she wants them to go next. I'm eager to see where that is. She's left the series wide open for sequels, tales of the next generation, or even prequels of Ben's life in Paris, in the War or 1812, or earlier.<br />I think I like mysteries more for the backstory and characterization than for the puzzle, but this one should appeal to mystery fans of either sort, as well as history buffs and those who can see a good novel even cloaked in a genre package.	2003-03-18

They're terrible books for reading on airplanes, because  all the other passengers will look at you sitting there doubled up with  laughter and will quietly ask the flight attendant to move you elsewhere.  Like the cargo compartment.<br />Bryson is not only funny, though; he's got a  way of gently conveying the absurdities of a place in a fashion that only  makes you appreciate it more. I spent a month in Australia and New Zealand,  and though I liked NZ more at the time, I found when I got back that it was  Oz, or more precisely its people, that I really missed.

We listened to  the first half on a long car trip, and I think it worked.  Jim Dale does a  wonderful job of reading, differentiating each character in a different,  and very characteristic, voice. (Apparently he's had to use 400+ voices for  HPIV!)<br />I was surprised to find how much I gleaned from Dale's reading  even after reading Sorceror's Stone several times. The slower pace and  different emphases of reading aloud highlight points that are easy to miss  in a silent reading. Also, hearing the Scots burr of Prof. McGonagall and  Hagrid's regional accent (Lancaster? Somerset?) serve to bring out aspects  of their characters that were less apparent to this American reader.	2000-08-29

In this current edition, that wish has been granted, helping me notice a few songs I'd overlooked  before.<br />Again, this is the best collection of songs you can actually  sing, with guitar chords that usually work pretty well (occasional problems  there may be in my skill level, not in the book!)  There's no current Top  40 (there is some Motown) but these are the songs people have heard and  sung and relaxed with and fought with and cried with and fallen in love  with.....and been made to think with.	2000-07-28

The only parts of my own wedding I regret are those I didn't personalize enough; I wish this book had been around back when I was doing my planning.  Fulghum doesn't provide concrete suggestions, so much as great stories,  illustrations of the impact of ritual on our lives (in which he stands  firmly with Jossepoh Campbell) and a wonderfully outrageous attitude toward  making those rituals fit us, not the other way around.  You won't take away  exact ideas of what to do for your own ritual, but you will get the  inspiration to make your own ritual fit you as perfectly as some of the  ones described fit their participants.<br />On another level, the book is also  worth reading just for the stories.

I think, though, that this may have been because I was  racing through the book, to see how Peters could resolve the heartrending  cliffhanger she left us with in the previous book.  On my next reading, I  found myself more caught up in Amelia's anguish over her children's peril,  Ramses' extreme stress and nobility, Nefret's attempts to prove herself,  and Emerson's reactions as the secrets in his past became major factors in  his present.<br />There are plenty of indications of Peters' careful plotting,  references to events in past seasons and revelations of mysteries her  readers have debated for years.

Elizabeth Peters' skills as a writer, not exactly paltry to begin with, have grown over the course of the Amelia Peabody books.  The series was always fun to read, but the latest few have an emotional impact most  mystery writers cannot match.  The characterizations, especially of the  younger generation, are much deeper than they used to be; Amelia and Emrson  are forced to grapple with events that challenge their composure more than  anything since Emerson's amnesia (in The Snake, the Crocodile, and the  Dog).  This does demand more from the reader, who can no longer be  confident that everything will be tied up in a nice neat happy ending by  the end of the book.<br />I almost subtracted a star, because Nefret acts in  a way that I believe to be out of character, but I left it in because  presumably Peters knows her characters better than I do, and anyway it may  be wishful thinking on my part.  At any rate, she has promised to tie up  some loose ends in her next book -- thank goodness!	1999-06-14

Harding's Luck and its companion, The House of Arden, have far  more complex and interwoven plots.  The events in the lighter House of  Arden form only a part Harding's Luck, as Dickie is a much fuller character  than Edred and Elfrida.  They must have been plotted together, as each  contains references to the other.<br />As in The Psammead and the Carpet,  there are numerous instances of Nesbit's socialist views (not in the modern  sense of big government, more along the lines of GK Chesterton's definition  &quot;A socialist is a man who wants all the chimneys swept and all the  chimney sweeps paid for it.&quot;).  Children will never notice these;  adults may find them sweet but sadly naive.<br />In their richness of plot and  character, and in the sense of something deeper and truer lurking behind  the superficial magic, these two are probably the crown of Nesbit's work.   Givn the fact that the paperback copy of Harding's Luck costs $10, it's  worthwhile to shell out another $7 for the hardback, so you'll have it  longer.	1998-11-17

Smith discusses Quaker principles and how he and others have incorporated them into their lives -- for example, he fought in  WWII after deciding that  joining the fight against a malignant evil  outweighed the Quaker principle of pacifism, in this particular case. A   good discussion on how to live ethically.	1998-10-27

In  this case, though, the comparisons really are valid.  The best of  children's literature discusses good vs evil in terms too direct for the  jaded taste and easy embarassment of most adults; fantasy especially lends  itself to cosmic issues.<br />The Dark is Rising certainly ranks among those  best books, and this may be the best in the series (with still competition  from The Grey King and Silver on the Tree).  Some idea of the impact of  this series may be conveyed by the fact that I can still recite, from  memory, all the poem/prophecies in the series.	1998-10-09

Really though, to limit  a series like this to the realm of children's literature is a disservice to  adults.  While The Dark is Rising series is a necessity for any imaginative  11-year old, it is also absorbing for any reader willing to examine issues  more crucial than the usual boy-meets-girl, whodunnit, or political  &quot;thriller&quot; of standard adult fare.<br />A new character, Bran, is  introduced here.  He is a sensitively drawn Welsh boy, an albino, laboring  under the burden of his strange looks, as well as mysteries surrounding his  birth and eventual destiny.  He and Will form a friendship and partnership  that echoes a much earlier one between Merriman and Bran's father -- the  echoes of legend here are shaped in some incredibly subtle writing, yet  should be obvious to anyone who knows the least bit of British mythology  (the Matter of Britain).  It is clear though, as in the earlier books, that  the author herself has much more than a cursory knowledge of that myth  cycle and of local folklore.	1998-10-09

After several years of heavy use, mine is falling apart.   I disagree with a previous writer, in that I think this book has a wide  range of music, ranging from very old songs such as 'The Cutty Wren' and  'The Coventry Carol' to 1910s ('In the Good Old Summertime'), 1930s (Woody  Guthrie), Motown, protest songs, and modern folk classics (several songs  each from Stan Rogers, Bill Staines, James Taylor, Joni Mitchell, and on,  and on...).  Rise Up Singing owes some of its genes to Winds of the People,  an older compilation (I think circulated by the Society of Friends) and it  shows.It is certainly slanted more in the direction of those who wish to  build a better world rather than those want to retain the status quo, but I  find it fascinating to see how that status quo has changed, in protest  songs from way back ('The Waulking Song') or about events from way back  ('The Diggers') through the battles for universal suffrage and the labor  songs of the 1930s and 40s, to problems of the present day.   Plus, I just  like to sing the songs.  My only complaint is that, at least in my  mid-1980s edition, the songs are not indexed by author.	1998-09-28

'Stones' is centered around Roger, son of the Norman  lord who first built Green Knowe.  His travels into his future bring him  into contact with Tolly, Susan, and some of the other children from the  series.  Without being dry and preachy, this book conveys the richness of  English history along with the warmth of its characters and story.	1998-09-28

The central character Emma, and her husband Nick are complex but seem to be missing some pinch of salt.	1998-07-27

Despite the backgrounds of both authors, Freedom and Necessity is not really fantasy, except maybe for a bit of alternate history (ie a fictional main character, in the book, is a major part of the Chartist movement) and some occultism.  Demands several readings; you'll pick up something new each time, although I'm still not sure the occult subplot doesn't have a few loose ends.  Complex characterization.  Bull and Brust must have done huge amounts of research into history and philosophy, not to mention staying awake through most of Hegel.  Well worth the time and focus required to finish the book.	1998-07-27

Throughout War For the Oaks, Bull displays a thorough knowledge of British / Celtic folklore and folk music, and the music culture of modern Minneapolis. Manages to be both stylish and engaging. One of her best, and one of the best modern fantasies ever.	1998-07-27
