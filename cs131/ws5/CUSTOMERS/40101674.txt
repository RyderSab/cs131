Her writing task must be such enormous pressure.<br /><br />That's kind of what I felt as I read this book - pressure. There were a lot of words that didn't do much to advance the plot.<br /><br />It was interesting seeing some new places, like Grimmauld Place and the Ministry of Magic. And I loved the new room at Hogwarts that was there when you needed it. But those things were ultimately very unsatisfying because of some of the aggrieved feelings the book provoked in me, such as:<br /><br />1) after all the grief Umbridge had put the school through, her comeuppance was extremely dissatisfying<br /><br />2) the plot line with Snape, who was emerging as a sympathetic character, just kind of died. The last we saw of Snape, he was in Umbridge's office with Harry - what had been going on with him in the meantime?<br /><br />3) and what was the deal with the big fight over the prophecy bubble if it didn't matter if it was broken or not?<br /><br />All in all, I am left feeling deflated, with the feeling that this book was dark and depressing and morbid. The plot doesn't seem to have moved along all that much, considering the 800+ pages Rowling was working with.	2005-08-25

Ruth was SO DUMB AND PASSIVE. Her husband was SUCH A MOMMY'S BOY. The in-laws were SO CHEERILY MANIPULATIVE. Everyone was a stock character, except for the baby, perhaps, but how much character development can there be in a newborn baby?

It was a great pleasure to read such a tightly woven story and gave me the impression that Kimmel has really WORKED on her craft as a writer -- she has the discipline to keep her writing spare and lean.<br /><br />The characters were lovely. Okay, I got a bit weary of Amos' constant pedantic mental plodding through books of theological thought that are obscure to anyone who hasn't spent time in a seminary, and there were times when I wished I could yank Langston out of the pages by her wrist, give her a smack in the head and then shove her back into the story, but Kimmel's resolution of the quirks of the two characters was worth these annoyances. At first, I thought Kimmel was just being show-offy of (and boresome about) her own time spent in seminary and graduate school, but as the characters opened up, I perceived there was a reason. Langston's mother was a jewel and the two little girls were haunting.<br /><br />Considering the subject matter (a brutal murder), this was a surprisingly witty book that made me laugh out loud several times at Kimmel's deft turn of a phrase. The ending was superb.<br /><br />I loved it. I recommend it highly. Kimmel is a gifted writer.<br /><br />(P.S. I had those little cream cheese mints at my own wedding and they aren't THAT bad.)	2004-10-11

After being wowed by \\"Cause Celeb\\" and delighted by the two Bridget Jones books, I have to wonder what on earth happened with THIS book??!!<br /><br />The character Olivia Joules has a paper-thin development which leads a reader -- me, in particular -- to feel no particular sympathy for her. By the end of the book, Osama bin Laden could have eaten her leg roasted over a spit in an Afghanistan cave and I would have thought, \\"Oh, well.....that's a shame. *yawn!*\\"<br /><br />Every character was paper-thin, now that I think about it. This is an acute disappointment after \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", which I personally thought was a brilliant book (I bet Jane Austen would have thought so too!) \\"Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason\\" was equally well-thought out and very funny. When one gets used to characters who seem as if they could step off the pages and into your living room, it's a disappointment to deal with Olivia Joules.<br /><br />Not to mention the fact that the plot was just....dumb. By the time we got to Scott rescuing Olivia from the Middle Eastern Bad Guy at EXACTLY THE RIGHT MOMENT before Olivia was killed, I wanted to throw the book across the room.<br /><br />This book was nothing more than a light, fluffy beach read. It had none of the charactertization, none of the plot, none of the zinging, stinging social commentary of Fielding's first three books. It had nuthin'.	2004-10-11

I dearly loved Haven Kimmel's first novel, \\"The Solace of Leaving Early\\". It was one of those books whose ending was so utterly satisfying on so many levels, I felt lighthearted for the rest of the day after I finished it (having read until the small hours of the morning.) \\"That,\\" I kept saying to myself, \\"was a darned good book.\\"<br /><br />So I was watching and waiting for \\"Something Rising (Light and Swift,\\" ready to fall in love (or hate) with a whole new cast of characters. And so I read it, finished it, and closed the cover feeling puzzled and morose and saying, \\"Yes, but....\\"<br /><br />I just didn't like it very much. There was an underlying scornfulness, a mocking of people, that I found unattractive, considering Kimmel's smartness and sweetness and gentle prodding humor when describing the weirdness of small midwestern Bible Belt towns in \\"Solace\\". One got the feeling that she was giggling slightly at her own solid midwestern core that has been covered over with the shiny veneer of being a Published Author.<br /><br />But in \\"Something Rising,\\" I just didn't get that sense. It's a bit hard to define. There was an edge -- and I presume Kimmel meant it to be there -- of razor-sharp ugliness about it. No tenderness. No healing. No comfort. Just desolation and despair.<br /><br />It didn't make for a happy read. It probably wasn't supposed to. But I really hate the feeling of being left with a partially unresolved plot.<br /><br />And I wish someone would explain to me the significance of the title. The esoteric meaning has apparently flown right over my thick-as-a-stump midwestern head.	2004-10-09

You'll drop the book and run away screaming and never give another instant of thought to making milk soaps. MILK-BASED SOAPS was an informative book and I feel that it taught me some useful things (I have my own soapmaking business), but I was making goats' milk soaps long before I read this book and it just isn't as hard as she makes it sound, I promise.<br /><br /> I was really, really puzzled by Makela's instruction to cool the milk/lye mixture down to 80 degrees F while having the fats/oils at 120 degrees F and THEN mixing the two together. She says in the book that the milk/lye mixture will want to keep separating and falling to the bottom of the pot while you stir -- there's a reason for that, you know. It's because there is not enough 'synergy' between these two substances that are being combined at such wildly disparate temperatures. You know what? I bring my milk/lye mixture and my fats/oils mixture both to 110 degrees F for a 6 pound batch of soap and I have NEVER had any trouble. And I do NOT use all the multiple pots and blenders to scoop the raw soap back and forth, etc. I use one heavy stainless steel pot, one sturdy plastic Rubbermaid pitcher for the lye/milk and one stick blender. This does not have to be a group effort. Makela tends to make this sound as if you need a tag team of willing friends dressed in Haz-Mat suits standing at the ready to assist you in your time of need.<br /><br /> Truly. I make this soap all by myself. I do it all the time. It only has to be a big hairy deal if you intentionally make it that way.<br /><br /> One part where Makela is dead-on right is when she says to put the milk (in its pitcher) into a cold bath -- I stop up one side of my sink and add cool water and ice cubes -- and then pour the lye flakes slo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-owly into the milk. She is correct when she says that this should be AT LEAST a fifteen minute process, which is one of the reasons why I charge more for my goats' milk soaps. I owe Makela a thanks for the cool water bath idea -- it's a great one and I have never had trouble with the goats' milk overheating since I've done that. I appreciate that advice immensely. When you stir rhythmically, add the lye slowly and keep the milk nice and cool, you'll always have a sunny yellow milk/lye mixture that will easily combine with the fats and oils to make a really beautiful, creamy, buttery beige-colored soap.<br /><br />There were some nice recipes in this book and some worthy advice for marketing your handcrafted creations. All in all, it was a good book. Buy it -- and don't let yourself be intimidated by what is not really a difficult process at all.fifteen minute process, which is one of the reasons why I charge more for my goats' milk soaps.

Ann Bramson even managed to get me to boil down many, many pounds of utterly disgusting beef fat to make my own tallow (I do NOT recommend this -- it will make your entire house smell like a meat-packing plant), but I'm glad I can say now, as a veteran soapmaker, that I did try it a couple of times. I quickly moved on from the beef tallow and lard-based soaps to the vegetable based soaps, though.<br />I have a few quarrels with this book, such as stirring raw soap with a wooden spoon (only recommended if you like having wood splinters in your soap as an exfoliater) and adding water to the lye instead of the lye to the water (this could cause an eruption of lye to shoot right out of your container, very dangerous). I also think that her extravagant use of essential oils could bankrupt the uninitiated who don't know how much those little teeny bottles cost! But all in all, this is a wonderful, thorough book, a real pleasure to read. She has a great sense of humor and really conveys her obsession with beautiful, handcrafted soap very well.	2004-07-02

This is a really beautiful book -- the photography is gorgeous and I like Sandy Maine's style of writing.

But all it is is olive oil, coconut oil, Crisco...olive oil, coconut oil, Crisco...olive oil, coconu-- well, you get the picture.<br />I also think that adding 3 ounces of lavender to that baby soap is going to just about knock the baby across the room. That is an awful lot of scent for a baby soap.<br />I'm not sorry I bought the book. The pictures alone gave me some great ideas for packaging and displays. But buy another book if you want some REAL recipes. Save the money you would have spent on buying the enormous quantities of essential oils for these soaps and spend it on a gorgeous bottle of avocado oil. Let your imagination soar. Soapmaking is, in my opinion, an art form. It doesn't have to be as plodding and pedestrian as this book makes it seem.	2004-07-02

This book has great charts and Susan Miller Cavitch does a great job of explaining the science of creating soap - fascinating. I only wish chemistry had been this interestingly explained when I was a college student; I would have had a much better grade.<br />BUT...<br />The recipes in this book are really annoying. I am a veteran soapmaker and enjoy writing/making my own recipes, but I love to expand my knowledge and skill by making other people's recipes from time to time, too. The source of irritation in this book is the way the amounts of oils, liquids, scents, additives, etc. are delineated. The recipes veer wildly between English and metric measures and I find this very haphazard. I think it could be a real source of confusion to many. It sure confuses me, and I have made a LOT of soap.<br />I will say, though, that if you can work around the measures, the recipes she has presented do make some nice soap.<br />Since the confusing recipes comprise much of the book, I can't rate it as highly as I'd like to, considering the bounty of great technical info Miller imparts. So, three stars. But it is worth buying just because of the thorough explanation of the artistic science of soapmaking.	2004-06-12

The changes she goes through in her relationship with God ring so true. This is the most subtle, yet the most powerful part of this book and Seton's obvious respect for what Jesus can do in a person's life through the Truth and beauty of the Catholic faith is a wonder to see.

I couldn't put my finger on what it was. I began praying about this odd notion of mine, asking the Holy Spirit to lead me to a place of spiritual fulfillment.<br />When those first few Catholics and their books on apologetics came across my path, I was aghast. Surely God wouldn't call me to become CATHOLIC! Why, everybody knows that Catholics aren't even saved! Catholics defy the Second Commandment and worship idols! Catholics wrongly believe that you have to confess your sins to a priest! Every true Christian knows that we don't even NEED priests! Whatever else Catholics believe, it is wrong. Period.<br />This book was one of the books I was given. Karl Keating explains the major misconceptions of Catholicism so clearly. I finished this book in one day and when I closed it, I felt that I had been set free to worship God in the most satisfying, most spiritually fulfilling, most Spirit-led way ever devised by, well, God. I am now in RCIA class along with my husband (who was raised in a church that is typically stridently anti-Catholic) and we are experiencing spiritual growth that neither of us have ever known before.

There have been other scandals in the long history of the Catholic Church (which Jesus told us in the scriptures would happen when He said that there would be &quot;chaff amongst the wheat&quot;) but even as God disciplined the Church, He blessed her and brought her to a greater place of holiness, evangelizing more and more people with the good news of Jesus and His sacrifice that leads to our salvation.<br />So, in many ways, this book isn't so much about the triumph of the Catholic Church, fascinating as that may be. It is ultimately the story of how God loves us and continues to work His grace into us; it is a testimony to His compassionate understanding of our failures and our victories as we have walked the narrow path to heaven through the centuries.	2002-12-19

Noll, truly was a Catholic as he says, I'll eat a bishop's mitre. Along with the book titled &quot;Once A Catholic,&quot; this book documents such dubious scholarship and such an incomplete grasp of the Truth of the Roman Catholic Church founded by Jesus Christ, it's just astounding. As I say, if this man really was a Catholic, he was colossally uniformed and ignorant. I personally doubt his integrity.<br /><br />The long and the short of my opinion is this: If you want to read a book that DOES NOT teach the truth about what Catholics believe and if you want to read a book that confirms your personal opinion that all Catholics are going straight to hell and if you want to read a book that is merely another re-hashing of some of the glaring misconceptions that Protestants have about the Catholic faith, then read this book.<br /><br />But before you do that, you might want to find out what Catholics &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; believe about salvation, which is this: We are saved by grace through the shed blood of our Lord Jesus. Our lives, then, will be a testimony to that saving grace by the way we live. A person who is truly saved will be bearing the fruit of the Spirit in his life (see Galatians 5, 22-26.) A person who is saved will be running the race in order to win the prize, as Saint Paul said in Philippians, the prize being heaven, of course. No, this isn't the &lt;i&gt;sola fide&lt;/i&gt; (&quot;by faith alone&quot; or alternately, &quot;once saved, always saved&quot;) doctrine that some Protestant groups espouse, but then the doctrine of &lt;i&gt;sola fide&lt;/i&gt; isn't Biblical anyway.<br /><br />Doesn't it seem odd that I, a person who has never written a book, can do more to explain true Catholic doctrine in less than 1,000 words when Noll and others of his ilk can't even do it in their books? Doesn't that make them seem curiously biased and bigoted and as if they are people who are more concerned with promoting an anti-Catholic agenda than the real Truth of the Church?

He is such a nice man and means well, but this book DOES NOT represent the truths of the faith. My guess is that Mr. Coffey didn't really become acquainted with the realities of Roman Catholicism before he 1) left the Church; and 2) wrote this book. In spite of its warm tone, it merely re-hashes every misconception Protestants have ever had against the Church and it barely skims the top of those issues in the most superficial manner. For instance, his whole take on &quot;graven images&quot; made me so frustrated -- if he was a true Catholic, he should have known better! Mr. Coffey is no scholar. If he had done his homework, he would most likely today be embracing the beauties of his Catholic faith.

I was interested in the fact that Chevalier didn't take the trouble to paint Johannes Vermeer himself in a very sympathetic light -- why, I wonder? In the book, he was neither unkind nor ungentle, but still ruthlessly absorbed with his work, often to the detriment of the people around him. Chevalier paints Vermeer as a very selfish man in spite of his quiet aura.<br />I never could decide if Griet completely realized that he viewed her at one time as just an object -- an object to paint, an object to view with a certain amount of hidden lust and the impersonal interest that lust provokes; an object to wear an earring. And in the end, it wasn't even her sweet, innocent, girl-on-the-brink of womanhood face that was the focal point of his picture of her -- it was the earring. Chevalier made me wonder if the painting shouldn't rather have been called &quot;Pearl Earring With A Girl.&quot;<br />How Chevalier managed to convey all this without making Vermeer come off as a complet b_stard (he really wasn't) is a testament to the clarity of her writing gift.<br />The end of the story was a muted and tender surprise.	2002-06-29

Rose not only exposes the anti-Catholic fun-n-games going on in the seminaries, but also points out how the traditional, conservative orders are building the numbers of seminarians that come in year by year. If you read this, prepare to be shocked and then be ready to feel hope for the future as the anti-Catholic seminaries continue to die out.	2002-06-29

I have noticed, however, that many of them are all but gibbering ...in their rage, which means that Ann Coulter has once again touched upon the nerve of truth in \\"Slander.\\" Couched in her usual brassy and forthright style, Ann refuses to let loose her stranglehold of Democrat, liberal politics and policies and pins 'em to the mat over and over again. NOT a book for the faint of heart -- reading it could just about set your hair on fire. Hey, we know Ann hit the target since this book shot straight to the top of [the] most popular book list. Ooo, I bet that makes the liberals just want to give her the biggest pinch!...	2002-06-29

I found this book fascinating, being new to the Catholic faith. I never considered how blessed I am the the local parish is an old one, not ornate or beautiful, because when the church was built, the community was not a particularly prosperous one. But the church itself is a pretty one. Some modern touches have crept in, but NOTHING like the monstrosities Michael Rose photographed for his book. One church looked more like a rustic youth hostel than a place of worship -- and I couldn't recover from my shock at the Blessed Host being relegated to a back room chapel. As if He isn't welcome in the sanctuary! Trust the modernists to get everything deliberately backwards.<br />The day after I finished this book, there was an article in the paper about two Catholic churches in the area which are restoring the churches to their former glory. A good sign! Liberal Catholicism seems to be losing ground in many different ways.	2002-05-21

At that church, I could see people all around me who truly loved God and who had joyfully committed their lives to His service, just as I had....only I kept having this nagging feeling that there was something missing. Imagine my surprise when I found myself seriously looking at Roman Catholicism! I have never stopped loving my former church or the people in it, just as David Currie explains in his book, but I found there was a richness of worship in the Catholic church that we didn't have at my Pentecostal church. This book was one of the things that led me along the way, incidentally assuring me that I wasn't crazy! It is a very good book, and I recommend it to any person in a fundamentalist, Pentecostal or Evangelical church (or all three) that is searching for an answer to why they feel called to the Church of Rome.	2002-05-03

I bought it for my children and have found it to be a wonderful resource: we don't want them in church just following along in boredom with no understanding of Jesus' great sacrifice, made for His love of each one of us. This book is simple enough for a little one of five or six to understand and uses little poems (which adults find cheesy, but children generally seem to love) to describe the various events. This book is not a missal that gives, for instance, the actual words of the Penitential Rite or the Creed -- for that you would need an actual children's missal. In spite of that, I am glad we have this book to help us teach our children about the enormous significance of what happens at the Mass.	2002-05-03

Books	5	30	33	N	Y	A helpful book for explaining the whys of the Catholic faith	This little book has been a lot of help to me. As a convert to Catholicism, I needed a way to explain the Catholic faith to my parents (I want them to convert, too) and I found it in this book. It provides scriptural support for questions like &quot;Why do Catholics have a priesthood if the Bible says that we are all priests?&quot; and &quot;Do Catholics worship the saints?&quot; I think it is very well done and provides lots of Bible references, in addition to the initial explanation of each topic. This is all done, by the way, in a manner that does NOT suggest that Protestants are stupid and deluded for not believing as Catholics do, which I appreciated. It is simple and matter-of-fact, very readable and easy to use.	2002-05-03
US	40101674	RDR89D30155EA	0818906790	333359133	My First Missal	Books	5	21	21	N	Y	The Mass nicely explained for children	\\"My First Missal\\" is one of those little books that is so inexpensive, you might not immediately see its usefulness... \\"My First Missal\\" tracks the entire Mass (with pastel-colored drawings along the way), explaining why we do the things we do in simple-to-read detail, following the pattern of the Mass in Ordinary time. It is easier for kids to follow along with than it is for them to use the missalette in the pew. There's also a nice part at the end which explains the Sacrament of Reconciliation and teaches children how to examine the conscience. We keep copies of this little book on our church's book table and my children each have their own copy.	2002-05-03
