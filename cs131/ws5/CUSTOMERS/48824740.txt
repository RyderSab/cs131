They round the corner, and all but one are never seen again.<br /><br />The story deals with the aftermath of the dissappearance -- the reactions of the townsfolk, the school mistress, the help, the other girls, and while it's vaguely interesting, there are too many character's,and a few rumination's too many.<br /><br />Lindsay evokes some spookiness, but overall, the novel is bogged down by fancy, old-fashioned prose, and its inability to keep the element of mystery at the forefront.  The last ten or so pages are riveting, but it isn't enough to out weigh the other 178 pages of boring.	2005-03-02

His depiction of late 1950's suburban life is brutal, and I can only imagine, all too real. The mastery in which he switches from Rabbit's to Rabbit's wife Janice's point-of-view, is breathtaking.<br /><br />I have to admit, about 160 pages in I was annoyed, ready to label Updike a pig, and about to shut the book.  Some unameable instinct kicked in, and I kept going, and thank goodness.  The narration redeemed itself with a shift into deeper complexity, and moral amibiguities.  I recanted my distaste 10 pages later and completed the book in awe of Updike's skill.<br /><br />The novel more than holds its own 40 odd years after its initial publication. Do yourself a favor.  Read it.	2005-03-01

Under the influence of liquor and the lull of a moving train, he confides in Bruno, revealing his deep distaste for Miriam, his estranged, pregnant, wife.<br /><br />Thus begins an unrelenting path of secrets, lies, obsession and murder.  The fascination lies in Highsmith's ability to twist the everyday into nightmare.  Strangers on a Train, is taut, well-crafted, and difficult to put down.  It's a brilliant example of suspense done right, & a blueprint for legion's of mystery novels to come.	2005-02-27

Death &amp; Dream have the strongest stories by far. The Delerium &amp; Despair tales are tepid &amp; confusing.  Desire &amp; Destruction have so-so appearances &amp; Destiny's story is pretty much redundant.<br />It's hard to give this collection 3 stars- I was really looking forward to it.  The first 10 Sandman books are beautiful.  I treasure them.  And this was the first 'spin-off' (as in not directly, sequentially linked to the others) that appeared promising.  It was fairly enjoyable- it just wasn't on par with the others storywise (the artwork is lovely).<br />If you've read everything else, by all means read it.  I'm just happy I checked it out of the library.<br />If you're new to Sandman start at the beginning, with 'Preludes &amp; Nocturnes'; I doubt you'll regret it.	2004-04-21

Or is it because of the mass influence it's had on culture? I'm going with the latter.<br />I found it, overall, to be a pretty boring book, our glimpses of Dracula are slim, the only interesting narratives are those of Lucy & Mina, & Stoker's overwhelming message of women + sex = way too scary for any decent man to handle, is pretty annoying.<br />So read it because it's a classic, & because without it legions of great movies & books may have never been written, but if you're looking for excitement, stop at go.	2004-04-19

If you haven't read Daphne DuMaurier's 'Rebecca,' I would absoloutely read it before venturing onto this one.  It will make much better sense, and add endless delights to your reading.<br />I thought this book was quite well-done.  It starts out painfully slow, but after the first narration, picks up &amp; begins to fly.  By the time Rebecca's second notebook is revealed- it's exciting!<br />What I enjoyed most about the novel was that even with the words from the oh-so mysterious Rebecca, right there on paper, there were still endless possibilities as to what truly happened between she &amp; Maxim all those years ago.<br />The original novel is a masterpiece, &amp; Beauman was brave to play with such well known character's- she must have had such fun!<br />The overriding theme of freedom for women &amp; what it means to be denied choices, was nicely done &amp; well said.<br />Recommended!	2004-04-18

It starts off great, with the spirit of the deceased father hanging out in a tree- communicating to the family, but it just doesn't really go anywhere from there.<br />It's all about the tree &amp; what could be a fruitful (pun intended) plot point just falls dull.<br />Coming of age? barely.  Dealing with death? not in the interesting way it could have been.  Lots of books out there to read? yes.  Should this be one of them?

A sequel she is torn up about.  Who is she to write these light little cake frosting books? And how can she make sure her other two daughter's are getting what they need? Has she failed Norah in some irrevocable way?<br />There's definatly enough by way of plot to fill the book, but Shield's chooses instead to use the plot points as a way of jumping off into meditations on what it is to be a woman today.  Where do women stand? What is their place in the literary canon? How far have women really come, when there is still so far to go?<br />The chapters are interspersed with letters to editor's &amp; author's addressing these questions- letters she will never send.<br />I found the novel stirring, thought provoking, funny &amp; altogether lovely.<br />Carol Shield's is a brilliant writer &amp; I always look forward to reading her work.<br />Recommended!	2004-04-06

This amusing little book (large print, 200 pages) is told through the various perspectives of those caught up in the election &amp; gives a humorous look at the lives of those affected.<br />I hate to say I liked the movie better than the book- but, I did.<br />While the book is charming &amp; funny- the character's actually have less depth than they do in the movie- &amp; the laugh's are much fewer.  The book also lacks emotional resonance, whereas the movie actually gets you more riled up about the election &amp; what happens to those involved.<br />It's a quick, easy read &amp; it does provide some amusement- but I'm going to have to say, (and it pains me to do so) that you're better off watching the movie.	2004-04-05

Ghost Roads is a heck of a lot better than Out of the Madhouse- there are actual conversations in this novel & not just a bunch of action sequences piled up on one another.<br /><br />The plot gets more interesting as Oz, Angel & Buffy follow the ghost roads in search of the heir to the Gatekeeper.  Willow, Giles, Cordelia & Xander try to keep things in check back home in Sunnydale.  Of course, the Sons of Entropy are out in full force & as a refreshing change of pace Spike & Dru are thrown into the mix.<br /><br />Typical of the Buffy books, this one is fast & easy to read & 100% avoidable if you haven't seen every episode of Buffy a gazillion times already.  I only read them because I'm Buffy deprived- purely a guilty pleasure.	2004-04-05

There aren't any ghosts (except of course the past)- or creepy crawly things, but just the idea/fact that a concerned mother can bring her child in for a medical diagnosis & have the tables turned on her so quickly.  In the narrator's case, the doctor's think it is she who is making her daughter ill.<br />And from there begins the unravelling- a marriage, the past, a life so seemingly comfortable & steady.  Not only is the book quite thrilling with suspense, (will they take her child away?) it is also a meditation on what happens to a family in crisis.<br />This book just misses the 5 star mark by a fizzled end- the carbonated excitement went flat, & the last few paragraphs fell victim to the authorial hand.  It felt like the author wasn't quite sure how to end things, so she copped out with a lame sequence- which I won't reveal.<br />Aside from that, the book is wonderfully gripping & I highly recommend it!	2004-04-04

The House Sitter is the first novel I've read by Peter Lovesey, and I now look forward to reading more of his work.<br />There's no need to go into the plot (it's summed up already at the top of the page), but I should tell you that the writing is engaging enough to be a real page-turner &amp; literary enough to escape the boring realm of genre mystery.<br />My guesses as to whom the killer might be were totally off, which is exactly what I want from a mystery; the character's(even bit players) had enough charm or creepiness to be more than one-dimensional, and there was just the right amount of humor- allowing the narrative to escape being bogged down by too much death.<br />Recommended!	2004-04-02

It reads like an actual diary- full of insight, misguided intentions, lies, doodles &amp; what reads as the real thoughts of a young girl- not the adult hindsight of what it was to be a teenage girl.  Minnie feels so real it's hard to believe it's fiction! Kudos to Pheobe Gloeckner for accomplishing such a difficult task.<br />The drawings &amp; comics are marvelous &amp; I cannot wait to get my hands on the rest of her work.<br />The text is raw, engaging &amp; harrowing. The disconnection between Minnie &amp; the adults around her is tragically realistic. I felt emotionally connected to Minnie, as though she were a friend &amp; not a fictional character.<br />Highly recommended!	2004-03-28

Patricia Carlon's writing style is clean, engrossing & timeless (I was quite surprised to dicover this book was written in 1967).<br />The novel centers around a little girl who has been locked in a kitchen by her caretaker, who is then murdered before she can let the girl out.  It takes the murderer sometime to figure out that the little girl is stuck in the apartment with the body. The rest of the book is filled with endless near misses as the girl tries to find a way of escape & the murderer tries to find a way to kill the little girl.<br />The problem with the book is that the near misses keep piling up & become more & more frustrating.  I kept rolling my eyes at the pages. \\"Would someone just go get the girl for goodness sake?\\" I wanted to shout.<br />The book is brimming with great characterization.  Carlon knows how to get into the minds of everyone from a small child, to a nasty custodian, to a confused old man & so on.<br />I will absolutely read more of her books.  I have a feeling she's written something better than this.	2004-03-28

But, like so many Buffy books, once the 40 page action sequences begin- I could care less.<br />It's just that after watching the show- the action doesn't translate well onto the page, not to mention I never read action books. (Aside from Buffy & I only read the books because i miss the show).<br />The ending drips with Angel/Buffy cheese, but overall, the narrative does have a lot of fun faery facts & Willow is practically the star of the story (I love Willow).<br />I wouldn't say don't read it, just don't expect anything too great.	2004-03-24

One of the things I love most about Buffy as a whole, is character development.  This book was so busy with endless action sequences, that the character's personalities were largely ignored.<br />When the book stops for emotional moments it's hard to care, because the character's have all become cardboard cut-out's of themselves.<br />I'll go ahead & read the next one- I'm hoping that Golden & Holder will let up a bit on the constant barrage of battle- it gets tedious after awhile.<br />Proceed with caution.	2004-03-18

Upon finishing it, I wondered if I'd read the same book.<br />If your looking for anything even the tiniest bit scary, steer clear of this one! The book concentrates more on the dysfunctional marriage of the two 'ghost hunters' who decide to live in 'julian's (rumored to be haunted) house'.  Their relationship is not among the happiest, most of it stemming from David's sexual dysfunction.  There was such a lack of chemistry between them- I didn't understand why they were married in the first place.<br />The book sets you up with a lot of parapsychology talk, making you think you're about to embark on a frightening journey. Nope.  There are a couple of minor thrills, but they don't go anywhere.<br />It's well researched, so it gets three stars, but if your looking for spooky ghosties, you won't find them.	2004-03-15

The chapter's bounced around from past, to present, to family members the reader had previously gotten to know,to random fourth sister-wive's (creepy term)third grandaughter, never previously mentioned.<br />I didn't care about any of the people, except for some of the sad, sad women who were sucked into the 'lifestyle' by naive choice mixed with force.<br />Making things even worse, the book was so dreadfully boring most of the way through- the history of the Mormon's fleeing to Mexico was confusing, (so many wives to keep track of) &amp; tedious.<br />What does Solomon really think about the polygamist lifestyle? She chose not to stay within it- but her thoughts on it are as riddled as the messy narrative.<br />I gave it two stars, instead of one, because I do admire her bravery- I'm sure she angered a huge amount of her brethren.<br />Overall, the book made me feel creepy, sad, and bored. I don't recommend it.	2004-03-12

Greewnwood's first novel is a nice, lyrical endeavor, but the strength of the writing cannot overcome the overwhelming coincidences structuring the narrator's breakthrough from pain to forgiving.<br />The only new friends she makes while in semi-seclusion at her late grandfather's cabin, are the brother of the little girl whose death she is trying to overcome &amp; another abuse victim like herself (the other trauma she is attempting to work through).<br />While the descriptions of her surroundings are almost real enough to touch, and the flasback/forward structure of the novel intriguing enough to pull the reader through, I felt there was a hefty amount of narration missing- whenever Effie went back to the places that haunted her, the prose became almost too poetic- where where the raw, gutteral emotions she must have been living with?<br />There were holes in the narration... too many to warrant a 4 star rating.  Although, my interest in her newer novels remains- I hope that as she grows as a writer her stories will gather a more solid strength.	2004-03-07

I practically needed a chart to keep track of all of the character's.<br />So, if you like your mysteries filled with drawing room chatter &amp; not a lot of physical movement/uncovering- I highly recommend this- if you like more suspense, turn to Ruth Rendell or Patricia Carlon.	2004-03-07

I wish there had been more about her life before Monaco.  There was so much 'talk' throughout the book about how much Grace changed once she became part of the principality &amp; I wanted to be able to contrast that more thoroughly with the earlier part of her life.<br />I found myself becoming much more interested in the crazy lives of her daughters, than the formalities of the palace (which were gone into ad naseum).<br />Overall, I'd say if you're a huge Grace Kelly fan you'll probably want to read this- although be warned, the overall tone is pretty depressing.  If you're like me, and don't know much about her, the first 26 years of her life, which are skimmed over in this book- sound like they might be more fun to read about.	2004-03-04

You aren't forced to jump around within the narrator's mind, instead the thoughts meld together in a pattern fairly easy to understand.<br />Her memories (I've read that this is largely autobiographical) of school & her parents shop, are absorbing & powerful- her blatant admittance of shame regarding the juxtopositon between life at home & life at school (the extreme difference in class status)- is brave as well as cringeworthy.<br />I admire Ernaux's ability to create a character that is in many ways unlikeable, yet at the same time understandable.  She does an amazing job getting into the confused mind of a growing girl & the hypocritical shameful thoughts one is prone to at that age.<br />It was wonderful to read a not quite coming of age story set in France- the only reason it escapes the 5 star rating was due my boredom with the narrator's sexcapades- certainly a large chunk of a teenaged girls fixation in life- but I just didn't care that much about her 'redheaded boy'.<br />Recommended!	2004-03-04

Her tone is even- not monotonous.<br />While the character's struggle, it's easy to feel that somehow things will work themselves out without too much of an uproar.  This largely stems from what must have been a concious &amp; quite effective choice to leave the uproarious scenes out. The reader is then allowed to imagine the confrontations themselves- or not.<br />The novel doesn't get a 5 star rating from me, because I agree, like some of the other reviewers here, that there are too many character's in such a slim work, &amp; that it is quite hard to keep them straight. Hadley does provide a family tree outline at the beginning of the book &amp; it does come in handy.<br />I was quite moved by the last line of the book &amp; found it to resonate nicely as a whole.<br />Recommended!	2004-02-26

This could be a bad thing depending on your expectations, and would have made for a very different read had Powell decided to stretch out the more adult issues, but she didn't- and it keeps the tale as soft as the dreams of the children within the pages.<br />Overall, the book is a sweet read, but I think the darkness that shadows the minds of most of most of the adults in the book could have been explored a bit more deeply- it could have added another layer that would have made the bright & the dark, so often found in fairytales, (which this book emulates in many ways) a more interesting, multi-faceted contrast.<br />Powell seems to have a nack for storytelling, and I look forward to her next endeavor- I think she may have the ability to go deeper, which would make her writing less forgettable.<br />A good, quick, escape novel, but not something I'd pass on to friends unless they were looking for a super light read.	2004-02-17

I finished this book in the bathtub this evening, and was ready to sink under the water, yet of course rise again- which seems to be much of what rhys' anti-heroine julia does again &amp; again in this marvelous book.<br />I agree with another reviewer who wrote that this book goes beyond the 'woman condition' into the broader range of humanties inability to connect with one another. But I would also place this book high on the list of important women's literature.<br />Although published in 1930, Julia's inability to function in the way society wants &amp; expects us to- struck a resonanting chord in me.  It isn't that she is rebelling; she just isn't functioning- and I admit to feeling stuck in that same, frightening place.  (although I don't hit strange men up for money).<br />This book should be placed in the literary canon, and discussed along with the rest of the 'big boys of literature' about what it means to be lost &amp; meandering.<br />Highly recommended!	2004-02-09

I titled my review as such, because it seems most of the reviewers here had a prior attatchment to the town of Liliy Dale, or the subject at hand, before reading the book.<br />I picked it up merely for the provocative title, &quot;the town that talks to the dead&quot;.  I found Christine Wicker's investigative book, refreshing and fun.  I am a sceptic &amp; a confused believer myself, and am also intrigued by the idea of the afterlife, spirits - and such.<br />Wicker seems honest throughout the book, her scepticism and her inner willingness to believe in the spiritual insights of the mediums- butts heads, intermingles, and occasionally meshes.<br />The overall focus of the book- the idea that none of us truly knows (no matter what we believe) what happens after we depart from this earth, is enlightening.  Wicker's positive message that no matter what we believe- there is real power behind positive thinking, love &amp; hope, and that life can truly be ultimately uplifting.<br />Not to mention the subject matter at hand- an entire town of spiritual mediums? It's not your everyday read- I highly recommend it!	2004-02-09

Chevalier's multi-narrated novel, Falling Angels, is an utter bore!<br />The story centers around the friendship of two neighboring girls in post Victorian England-one beautiful and vapid, the other brainy.<br />The story comes to the reader from several points of view: each of the girls, 2 housekeepers, the boy who works at the graveyard, the mothers, the fathers, and so on.  A cast this large sharing the narration lends itself to confusion or an extremely fast-pace (or both), but unfortunatly, in this book, the characters are almost always lacking in ANYTHING riveting to say- that the only place I was led into was boredom!<br />The women in the book who stand for things, or cross the line dividing &quot;good girls&quot; and &quot;bad girls&quot; are punished- it felt like some kind of out-dated lesson in womanly politeness.<br />There are two horrid deaths in a span of a few pages, and you could practically see Chevalier's fingerprints on the pages.  It's never good when you can feel the author squeezing their characters until they pop.<br />The only reason I gave this book two stars is because of the details Chevalier supplies about the day to day life of the women.<br />I might have liked the novel more if Chevalier stuck to the voices of Jenny Whittbey, and Kitty Coleman - at least they had some interesting things to say.<br />I'd stay away from this book if I were you.	2003-08-18

While not laugh out loud funny, the book offers up more than a handful of inside chuckle moments.  From the AA member who only drank once, to the woman who abandons her former life and builds a house on a rooftop- the narrators are consistently strange and altogether human.<br />The books one downfall is its limited range.  The stories are great, but they all sound like the same person is narrating.  The book would have worked better as chapters/stories about one woman's life.  I didn't believe the stories were being told to me by a bunch a different women.<br />That fault aside, I recommend this book! It made me smile the smile of a co-conspirator.	2003-08-18

It's interesting when an author decides to write a collection of short stories about the same character.  It frees them from conjoining the moments in a charcters life- as chapters often do, and allows the author a more open playing field in regards to point of view, and structure.<br />That said, in this collection, I would have enjoyed it much more if Pritchard decided to use one of the voices from the first three stories in the book, and continued on with one of them throughout.  The remaining stories didn't live up to the expectations I gathered from the beginning.  I was heartily dissappointed that the Eleanor she first introduces is NOTHING like the Eleanor the book ends with.  I realize she grew up, but I missed the humor evoked in the first story.<br />Pritchard's experimentation with Eleanor's voice, though admirable, became old after awhile.<br />I recommend Pritchard's collection &quot;Spirit Seizures&quot; instead of this one.	2003-08-11

I could feel the author puppeteering his characters, never a good thing; plot devices were used that felt a bit too convenient, causing the story to lose its' credibility.<br />The ending was pure baloney.

I admire her work, and I was saddened to discover the pain in her life - a pain soothed and heightened by alchohol, barbituates, and sleeping pills.  An abusive mother (hers, Jackson comes off as a warm loving mother with her moments just like the rest of us), a philandering husband (who saw her genius, and loved her, but still couldn't keep his pants on), and the sad legacy she left behind for her children to cope with.  Oppenheimer follows up on their lives, and they appear pretty reclusive and strange (strange can be good, but their brand of strange read as sad).<br />So, although the book left me saddened, I think it was a fine read- a real page turner at that, and will add new insights into the books of hers I haven't read as well as the ones I have.	2003-06-19

The essays in this book are warm, funny, true, and lovely.<br />I've read many books of essay's where the authors' own interest in the subject(s) at hand, extends further than the readers attention is willing to give.  This isn't the case with Grealy's book.<br />I found her musings, and meanderings, engaging throughout.<br />Her essays take on daytime talkshows, playing with pets, the nature of twins, lost brothers- and ultimately her own struggles to make some sort of sense, or nonsense of things. Her prose talks with you- not at you, and asks you, without any finger wagging, to join in the conversations she is having with the page.<br />I loved it.	2003-06-04

I live in New Mexico, and I thought this book was going to teach me all I need to know about planting in an unhospitible climate. People have beautiful gardens here, and it's astonishing what flourishes in the dry, hot sun.<br />I'm a novice gardener who plants with a trial and error sensibility. I ask a lot of questions, move plants around, etc. This book didn't help me at all. I found it confusing, lacking in information, and a basic pain in the rear to sort out.<br />I would have given it one star, but the pictures are lovely.<br />Ask a gardener.  Leave this book alone.	2003-06-04

It never made it that far. The prose was easy enough, but the drug and sex references would have been innappropriate for her.<br />I am confused by the overwhelming love for this book presented by the other reviewer's here. I'm not sure how old they were when they originally read it- but if I had read it 15 years ago, at age 13, I would have found it silly.<br />There was a lot of ambiguity in the book - is this the future? the past? Is the author promoting a look to God, religious theme, or doing a take on cult religion/fantasy? In the end, it's hard to care, although I felt a bit creeped out.<br />The prose is chock full of weepy romantics, tough girl exteriors, and goofy sex (I wanted to puke when the boy kept referring to Nikki as \\"Nikki darling,\\" HOW old are these kids?)<br />I liked the ending, even though it was a seriously cliched message: your basic, \\"remember always, and what you have lost will never die.\\" In an otherwise heavily flawed, junk novel, it was nice to feel SOMETHING, even though it was an overused truism bringing the emotion on.	2003-06-04

What a great idea to recreate the story of the mean, green witch most of us know so well. Or do we?  (My sister, during one summer vacation, watched the Wizard of OZ Every. Single. Day. I wasn't pleased.)<br />At first I was intrigued. It was riveting reading about this well known character's other side.  The Wicked Witch of the West's early life? Do go on.<br />But once Maguire went into heavy, in-depth details of her political ideas, and alliances, I found myself trapped in the Not So Wonderful World of Yawn.<br />Perhaps this book is more interesting to the OZ obsessed. Others, proceed with caution.	2003-06-04

I do remember a tad of the information on Lilith, but that may just be a culmination of other things I've read on her, and not what was in the book.<br />This book presents itself to you: the smooth texture of the cover, the small/longish size, the riveting pictures.  That's why I'm giving it three stars instead of two.  It's an aesthetically pleasing book to read.<br />The book is filled with tidbit information: little sections on many things. The kind of stuff you read once and then forget. Oh, you'll probably hang onto a couple of things, but will you look at again? Remember it with fondness? Maybe.<br />If you're a collector of this genre it may be just your thing. But I prefer something more solid and encyclopedic to reference. Aesthetics only go so far.	2003-06-04

A young boy diappears on stage in the midst of a magic act. Poof! Where did he go? How will the family deal with this disappearing act?<br />Ursu takes on a myriad of point of views, dividing the book into dozens of tiny chapters: the father, mother, sister, clown, cop, reality that never was, etc. At first, it's riveting- but a little over a third into the novel I was tired of delving into these various psyches: the little girl's imagined worlds- the parents dreams... it all became tiresome.<br />Toward the end there's a plot point that speeds the narrative up again, but I can't give that away- now can I?<br />I wouldn't mind reading another of Ursu's books, but this one didn't thrill me.<br />A library loan, not a keeper.	2003-06-03

I was hesitant to pick up this book, fearing it was another one of those Bridget Jones knock-off's. I finally caved and checked it out from the library. I'm a nanny, and although the family I nanny for right now is fantastic, I've certainly had some terrible experiences in my past.<br />At first, the book is funny, and it's cool to peak into the upper echelon's of Manhattan's residents. BUT, after about 100 pages of reading about Nanny's experiences and her disregard for herself, I was irritated, and the laughter stopped. (I also found it silly that her name was Nanny- I'm sure it's meant to be some kind of statement about how all nanny's are interchangeable, just like the parents names: Mr. and Mrs. X, but this book isn't deep enough to utilize any quasi-profound ideas- it's just annoying!)<br />Nanny has the backbone of a worm. She continually repeats she's doing it for the child, and the money, but that excuse falls flat after awhile. The parents are monsters and they treat her with no respect what so ever.<br />I was confused by Nanny's money problems. She attends an ivy league school, has parents and a grandmother who seem well-off, and also, mind you, keep telling her to quit, so I didn't understand why she couldn't get financial help from them- she never explains this.<br />The end was unsatisfying- I closed the book thinking, &quot;Wow. THIS is a best seller?&quot; Oh well, fluff sells.<br />I suggest you read something else.  If you want to laugh and read something intelligent and entertaining, check-out Lorrie Moore's &quot;Self-Help.&quot;	2003-02-05

(She only alludes to sex, but it feels forced or restrained - just not right).<br />I didn't give a poop what happened to the lord and his lady by the end... it was boring and silly, and I am astonished it has received so many good reviews here on amazon.

That said, American Gods seemed to be derived largely from the idea of gods existing and fading largely by the depth of the populations belief in them: a core plot motivator in the Sandman series.  What you don't get in American Gods is amazing graphics, characters you really give a flip about, and an intriguing 'oh my gosh where will this go next?' page turning plot.<br />Do yourself a favor.

The characters (which there were way too many of) were largely unbelievable, the plot was plodding even as it moved through various locations, and the ending was ridiculous.<br />At first, I was intrigued... the icy landscape and  detached narrator pulled me in; I thought I could almost feel the chill of Coppenhagen.  Unfortunatly, the book turned into an unbelievable action movie.  Smilla, the main character, is  5'2, and self described as small and thin (later in the book, as emaciated), yet manages to kick butt continually, throwing men twice her weight around; getting beat to a pulp and yet still managing to continue on with her crusade.<br />The typical best selling thriller cliches are shaded by a surplus of scientific jargon that only makes for a difficult read.  I found myself rolling my eyes at the page; groaning aloud as the plot became more and more of a boring mess.<br />A lot of people liked this book, so the appeal I initially saw in it must suceed and withstand for other readers.  My main warning for those of you considering this book is that if you don't like main stream thrillers with the same general characteristics hidden underneath whatever coating the author decides to employ, don't bother with this.	2001-08-06

I suppose, like the reviewer above said, that this isn't a beginning vegetarians cookbook, in the sense that it does not guide you through what it means to be vegetarian etc, etc, BUT, I'd like to point out that nowhere on the book does it say that is what it is (there are books for that).  I also will agree that yes, in SOME of the recipies there are strange ingredients: fat-free half and half, cactus paddles, flavored cooking sprays... but there are over 1,000 recipies!  Of course they had to get creative!<br />I think this cookbook is excellent, if you've been a vegetarian for awhile, and you like to cook, then this book is perfect for spicing up your everyday cuisine.  The recipies are easy to follow, and so far (I've cooked a lot of dishes from this book) almost everything has been yummy.  I'd like to add that if I can't find something I substitute.  I use veggie bullion in place of stocks, and skim milk in place of fat free half and half, and I've never had any problems.  The book has widened my scope on mixing vegetarian ingredients, enabling me to scan my pantry and whip up combinations I'd never thought of before.  There is so much to chose from that you can keep it simple or get a little fancy!<br />Highly recommended!	2001-08-04

I wouldn't peg Paglia's book of essays as that, but i would approach it with trepidation. It wasn't that I didn't agree with most of her rantings (although I didn't), it was the way they were written.  Buried in a heap of reference after reference, it was almost impossible to trudge through most of what she said, without feeling the need to research every other sentence.  Her essays on date rape were linguistically digestable, although her ideas were fairly offensive, not to mention, reading this work in 2001 (It came out in the early 90's) makes a lot of her opinions read as outdated. At first I liked it, she made me angry and it was fun to wage an inner debate... but later on... I mean, do we really want to read her lesson plan for a class she once taught... all 50 pages of it? Do you get the idea?  A lot of it seemed like her own mental masturbation.  Proceed with caution.	2001-07-26

I am not a super gourmet cook, but I can prepare fairly complex things... point being, vegetable heaven is a little too frou-frou for me.  Unlike the original moosewood cookbook which combined easy to find items with innovative ideas, culminating in super tasty food, vegetable heaven goes to further reaches, incorporating more expensive ingredients to create recipes that just aren't as yummy.<br />I flip through several of my cookbooks before grocery shopping every week in order to inspire myself (i try to eat a variety of foods, and to shop inexpensively), and this book rarely makes the cut.  Although, there is one thing I found in it that has proven to be indespensible:  YOGURT CHEESE!  I use it as a substitute for sour cream and dallop it on everything from pasta to eggs.  TAKE FAT FREE PLAIN YOGURT SPOON IT INTO A COFFEE FILTER THAT HAS BEEN PLACED IN A COLANDER OVER A BOWL, STICK IT IN THE FRIDGE AND LET ALL OF THE WATER DRIP OUT (ABOUT 24 HRS).  mmmmm.... she doesn't say this, but you can chop up veggies really tiny, or add honey, or garlic and cucumber... it's awesome!	2001-07-26

Previously, I admired her for the wit and easy gait of her other novels and short stories, and the multifaceted knowledge she displays in her essays.  THE POSIONWOOD BIBLE blew me away with its intense characterization and clearly researched (but feeling all the while inhabitable) Africa.<br />Initially slow going, THE POSIONWOOD BIBLE picks up a third of the way through and becomes a heartwrenching, poetic tale of a family torn apart by religion, naivete, and cultural upheaval.  Kingsolver's rich characterization of the four women, and her amazing gift at relaying the story in several distinct voices, makes for an enriching and rewarding read.  What I specifically liked about this novel, was the fact that not only was I engrossed by the characters and the story itself, but I also felt like I learned a great deal about Africa.  I think when someone tells a story that reaches out and grabs you by the lapels, and also gives you the opportunity to learn something about culture and history, without making it feel like a seminar, you've got the makings of a classic.	2001-07-20

The story, &quot;SKINLESS,&quot; was met in class discussion with mixed reviews, while many enjoyed her sense of imagination, a lot of people found her tale to be highly unbuyable.  I agree with both of these opinions.  It isn't that Bender's sense of the odd or whimsical is unbelievable, I could see without a doubt the mutant girls with hands of fire and ice, the eccentric with the surgical hunchback, and the boyfriend &quot;experiencing reverse evolution,&quot; it's just that often, after setting up these interesting and original premises, she seems to forget the path she is taking and allows her characters to float away on whimsies and tangents, giving the stories utter lack of cohesion or a tangible meaning.  Only one of the sixteen stories left me with that &quot;now that's a good story&quot; feeling.  All of the stories had elements of what makes a story great, but unfortunatly they didn't follow through.  It is virtually impossible not to admire Bender's fantastic sense of the surreal made into reality, but in many ways it seems she is trying to cram too many ideas into each story, I often found myself thinking each of the stories could have been broken down into several more.  I recommend reading Bender in order to marvel at her imagination, just don't expect to feel the ultimate satisfaction often given at the end of other well crafted short stories.	2001-07-20

When I found the book at a library sale I thought I'd give it a go.  The book was even slower than the movie, and both were lacking any umph at the ending to make up for the laboriously snail like pace.  If Trevor's writing wasn't so crisp and clear, I would give this book 2 stars.<br />It isn't as though nothing happens at all, there's conflict, resolution, and plot development, but everything that does occur is unwoven so carefully it's hard to care. I couldn't get in touch with Felicia or Mr. Hilditch (I've spelled his name wrong), both character's felt continually held at an arms length from the page.  By the end of the book I was rushing through the final pages, not because I was riveted, but because I wanted to hurry up and finish.  The climax is made anti-climatic by tedious pacing. The movie took a lot of liberty in embellishing and ignoring certain details, but neither director nor writer spiced the story up enough.<br /> Have someone relay the details to you instead, it will probably be creepier.  If you're looking for a slow burner suspense novel that satisfies, read A Judgement in Stone by Ruth Rendell.	2001-07-16

I read This Boy's Life a few years ago, and while I enjoyed it, I wasn't blown away. But, In the Garden of North American Martyrs has given me a new and fierce admiration for Tobias Wolff.  Each story is well-crafted without being overtly so.  Like Raymond Carver, the style is slightly sparse and gives you the feeling that these people could be your next door neighbors.  The characters have that regular joe quality, but they are never ever boring, it only makes the things happening to them more potent.  From the man who wrecks his car, to the professor who has a one night stand, each tale is piercingly believable without ever being dull.  If you're looking for the kind of short stories anyone could aspire to, read this book!	2001-07-16

Light and breezy, this book makes a great entertaining read.  My only qualm (and this is why I'm wavering between three and four stars) is althought it was fun to read, it was so light I felt like the book might float out of my hands.  (Even with the undercurrents of divorce and suicide inhabiting the book). A novel does not have to be filled with some heavy duty message in order for me to enjoy it, I suppose what it is about the book that reads funny, is the  scary subjects within it, they feel out of place next to Hornby's witty tone. Something doesn't match up quite right, and it isn't that humor can't be found in the dark. That aside, Hornby is a talented and engaging writer, and if you liked High Fidelity I say read this one too(I liked High Fidelity more).	2001-07-16

I would have rated the book as a two star read, but, she does have a strength in her writing: there's an ability there to carry the reader along that I think might come out better in a more cohesive piece. A story mainly about displacement and pain, Danticat loses out by not establishing a richness in her characters.  The book is filled with traumatic, painful moments, but it was difficult to churn up any feeling because I felt like I didn't really know the character's, nor did I care much about them.	2001-07-09

At other times I felt lost, and had a difficult time digesting the words. (I would get to the bottom of the page and realize I had been thinking about something else).<br />I recommend this book; when her narrative sticks to the story at hand, it's a wonderful, thought provoking account.  The parts that drag or more to the point lose themselves don't by any means weigh out the good.	2001-07-07

Daniel Clowes is fantastic at capturing the subtle and not so subtle aspects of girls and friendship.  The comic is spooky, hilarious, dry and just right-on in so many ways.  Buy it!

Not only does Atwood weave a heartbreaking, beautiful, tormented tale, she does it with exquisite style and grace.  Her words suck you into the page.  There were many times (as in all of her books) that I had to stop and reread a line aloud because it was so good- just right on the mark.<br />This is not an easy, blow by the seat of your pants read.  If you're looking for late night fluff to divert your attention for a few hours (and there's nothing wrong with that) then I would say: stay away from this book.  I don't believe it was meant to be read quickly.  I am a fast reader and I generally whip through books... this one takes a bit longer- but it's worth it, and I think it's good when a novel asks you to pay attention.<br />When I finished the book I felt taken aback and admittedly, a bit teary... and, the best part... I just wanted to read it again.  It was that good!<br />It's a story about sisters, aging, science fiction, marriage, deception and a gamut of other fantastically written things.  GET IT NOW!	2001-06-29

I loved the ideas presented about language and identity.  But, towards the end, I found myself a little... well, not bored, exactly... less interested I guess.<br />It's worth reading though; Auster's writing is excellent and his ideas are intelligent and thought provoking.  Even though I became a bit disgruntled towards the end, I will go on to read the second volume in the series.	2001-06-28

I can't help but connect Robin Williams and co. jumping off of desks in Dead Poet's Society to the phrase Carpe Diem/ Seize The Day.  (I know, Saul Bellow wrote this book before Mr.Williams was even born!)<br />I thought this book had a great start.  I loved the characterizations in the first half, I felt I was really getting into it.  Sadly, by the second half, I found the book a bit tedious and unsatisfying.  The doctor character was just plain annoying, and although that very well may have been the point, it was irritating reading about him.	2001-06-27

I read Bridget Jone's when it first came out, and found it fairly unthrilling.  There was so much hype surrounding its humor, and I couldn't wait to laugh out loud.  It struck me as man obsessed, and a bit dull.  The movie, however, I adored!  It was funny, and made Bridget seem more real and loveable.  I must add in that I think what the media did in regards to Renee Zewelleger's weight was absoulutely despicable. She wasn't fat at all!	2001-06-27

At times, I longed for a more linear style, or a more indepth telling of some of the stories.  The end of the book, when Gormick goes into greater detail on her relationships with men in her life, was the part I enjoyed the most.  I thought those retellings revealed more about her character than any of the other vignettes. I closed the book still wanting more on the mother daughter relationship, I felt like there were chunks missing.  In some ways it was difficult for me to match up the mother Gornick watched as a child, and the mother she went walking with later in life.	2001-06-25

This novel is funny, insightful and haunting.  Her sense of humor is fantastic, I've read this book over again and I'm amazed at how right on she can be.  Free from the &quot;find your inner child, what mommy and daddy did to me&quot; psychobabble so overabundant in the &quot;when I went a little cuckoo&quot;  books of our era, Plath's telling is fresh, honest and different. (I'm not poo-pooing societies ability to get in touch with themselves, perhaps if Sylvia Plath had lived today she might have been able to cope better, I am just remarking that it makes for a different kind of read).	2001-06-20

But it is written so beautifully; that it is difficult not to deem it a fine peice of fiction.The vignettes, connected only through Esperanza's experiences are touching, sad, and sweet.

I think she was a brilliant, insightful writer with an incredible sense of craft.  I adore The Bell Jar, her poetry is amazing, and I have read biographies on her as well as her letters home, and I am now reading her unabridged journals.<br />BUT...

The last paragraph made me feel like the novel wasn't ending, but merely closing a chapter.<br />All in all, I would say read it, for it isn't a story one often hears, and it was very interesting, but read it more for expansion than story.	2001-06-01
