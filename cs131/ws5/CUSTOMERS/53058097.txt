You killed my father. Prepare to die.\\" While reading Tahn, I kept hearing that line echo through my head. The setting in Tahn is quite similar to The Princess Bride, being some medieval time that's still our earth while not fitting into any timeline we know of. And this novel could easily be classified as a fairy tale for adults. It's an exciting and fun ride at the beginning, though it slows down a lot toward the end.<br /><br />Leisha Kelly has written several Depression-era novels (Rorey's Secret, Julia's Hope, etc), but for this novel she's chosen to go a different route and thus the name change to L.A. Kelly. Tahn is definitely not one of those historical books she's known for.<br /><br />Lady Netta of the House of Trillet is awakened in the middle of the night by a somehow-familiar stranger attempting to kidnap her. What makes it even more bizarre is his claim that he's trying to save her. In shades of Oliver Twist, Tahn Dorn is an orphan raised a mercenary by a cruel man named Samis. But rather than pickpocketing, Tahn learns to kill. When he finally reaches the age he feels he can stand alone, he tries to break from his brutal lifestyle and save Lady Netta in the process because she has been targeted as the next to die.<br /><br />As the story progresses, Tahn takes in the small band of orphans he himself was supposed to train and tries to protect them as well with Lady Netta's help. But when Netta realizes that Tahn is the man who killed her husband years ago, things get rough. Can she forgive the man she swore to hate forever?<br /><br />As I said before, Tahn is a great adventure story that starts out with a bang and runs for a long time off of it. Both Tahn and Netta are well-crafted characters, and Samis is just plain mean. The kids are well-written for the most part as well. The problem comes in the fact that almost every character has some sort of internal struggle with forgiveness. Tahn worries about his past and how could God ever forgive him for that. Various other characters have their own struggles as well, including several last-minute additions to the cast who really seem to serve the sole purpose of slowing the story down. You'll breeze through the first half of this book, but it may take a little bit of effort to finish it-and I highly recommend you do. The ending is a good one.<br /><br />While there are shades of romance in the story, this isn't a romantic novel per se. There's enough action to keep most readers happy. The biggest stumbling block in the book is the budding romance between Lady Netta and Tahn. I understand that being a Christian means forgiving one's enemies, but falling in love with her husband's killer is a bit of a stretch.<br /><br />Tahn is a good book for the most part. Despite the slow second half, the story as a whole should keep you into it. And it's a pretty short read, so it won't take long to finish it.f internal struggle with forgiveness.

Have you ever been certain someone was watching you from the shadows? Remember the way your gut feels at those moments? James Byron Huggins does, and he can capture those moments on paper to make them last forever.<br /><br />If you like thriller-based fiction, you're going to be hard pressed to find someone more suited for it than James Byron Huggins. He's put out more consistently top-quality novels than any other Christian fiction author in recent years. As a matter of fact, his short trip into mainstream fiction with the novels Cain and Hunter found their movie rights purchased by Bruce Willis and Sylvester Stallone respectively.<br /><br />After a two-year hiatus, Huggins is back with Nightbringer, and the story is worth the wait. A group of tourists are visiting a monastery in Europe inhabited by a small number of rather suspicious-looking monks. While there, a snow storm sets in, trapping them for several days. Then something goes terribly wrong, and they realize that they are not alone. Something is stalking them...something evil patiently waiting to kill them all. As the story progresses, we find that even the monastery itself hides a terrible secret.<br /><br />Borrowing heavily from his earlier novels Cain and Hunter, Huggins works beautifully in creating a no-win scenario for his characters by pitting them against an apparently unstoppable foe in a hostile environment. This time around it's one of the Nephilim mentioned briefly in Genesis, having survived for centuries with a thirst for blood and death. There are several characters in the monastery, all with their own secrets and hidden pasts. One of the monks mentions the story of Cassius, the centurion who according to legend found grace at the foot of the cross and protected Christ's body until it could be taken down. Because of that, he was given by God the task of protecting His children until Christ returns, becoming the Wandering Jew of legend-and a warrior at heart who stalks the surviving Nephilim through the centuries. When a mysterious member of the group named Michael fearlessly takes on the creature and puts it on the run, the others are faced with a new question: Is this Cassius himself?<br /><br />I love the way James can take an intriguing creature mentioned in the Bible (as he did so beautifully in his novel, Leviathan) and weave an entire story around it by creating a seemingly valid explanation for its existence. I have to admit I thought at the beginning of this story that James was beginning to lose his touch by telegraphing something a little too much and seeming to drag out an obvious fact. I should have known better. The \\"I know where you're going with this\\" mindset will do you no good here, as James pulls a great plot twist out of this one (and I'm not going to explain any further about that...I don't want to spoil anything for you). Stories like this are the reason he remains my favorite Christian author. There is no slow point in this tale, and once the creature reaches the monastery, just go ahead and clear your schedule as there's no place to put the book down.<br /><br />My only complaint is the story's length. It's the shortest book he's written in years (easily less than half the size of his previous book, Rora). I wasn't robbed of anything in the story because of it; I was just having so much fun reading it I hated to see it end! Maybe this means he'll start cranking out more stories now since they're shorter (which is fine by me!).<br /><br />All in all, this novel stands easily beside anything out there today. Huggins has a gift for storytelling, and this book has a permanent place on my bookshelf beside his other novels. I rank this as the best novel I've read this year and can't wait for his next.<br /><br />Please write faster, James!Wandering Jew of legend-and a warrior at heart who stalks the surviving Nephilim through the centuries.

While the story is compelling (a priest is martyred in a small Bosnian village), I'm not sure what the purpose of reprinting it this way could be. While there is a new bookend story featuring Eve from WHW, I can't say it warranted an entire novella. There's not a lot added to the core story itself, and WHW did a much better job of resolving everything with the last half of the book. Readers choosing this one over the other might be robbed of the emotional impact found at the conclusion of the original. If you've read \\"When Heaven Weeps\\", you really aren't going to miss much by skipping this one. If you haven't read WHW, I'd suggest going for that one instead of this one. It IS a longer read, but it's worth the investment of time for it.	2005-09-06

Bringing in characters from all of their other books (Margo from Relic, Vincent from Relic and Brimstone, Nora and Bill from Thunderhead and Cabinet of Curiosities, and many others!) and creates an incredible story! Pendergast's brother has marked his friends for death and goes after them one by one. Let me tell you, the way \\"Brimstone\\" ended left me a little unhappy, but they explain it all perfectly here and bridge the gaps in time leading to this tale.<br /><br />You don't have to have read all the other stories from these authors to enjoy the novel, but I'd sure recommend it, as you'll miss little things here and there (Margo's fear of returning to the museum and what happens to her there are more terrifying if you've read her exploits in \\"Relic\\"). And hey, when you finish this you'll want to read the others anyway, so go for it.<br /><br />This novel ends powerfully, setting the stage for the next Pendergast story, and I can't wait.

Alten has created the perfect story, blending fact with fiction just enough to make it believable. His theory as to the origin of Nessie and exactly what she is makes perfect sense, and I don't think I've seen it approached this way by anyone before. Hey, it beats the dinosaur theory! Also, thank you, Mr. Alten for losing that present tense tone of voice you've had in some of your novels (\\"He walks into the room and picks up the book.\\"). That really gets annoying after about two sentences, and I'm glad he didn't go that route with this story.<br /><br />What a great piece of fiction! I can't recommend this one highly enough. Just clear off a lot of time from your calendar, because you won't put this down until you've finished it.	2005-06-14

With \\"Obsessed\\", we have an uneven but well-told story. The elevating tension felt in Three is not here, settling instead for a slow-burn rise the first few chapters that settles into simmering for the remaining portion of the book. The focus of the book is on the obsession of two characters for the same thing. Halfway through the book, the obsession of one changes, then the other does too, effectively destroying the need of the first half of the story.<br /><br />In all honesty, this isn't Ted's best book. The characters here make truly strange decisions that make no sense given the way they are portrayed to us. Their obsessions become fanatical far too quickly to be believed. The ending of the story doesn't really have a payoff like his previous books, ending with a sigh rather than a bang. Still a good read, but not on par with his previous thrillers.	2005-06-02

Now, what if you could remember the mistakes you'd made and could change them all? That's the premise of Russell Williams's novel, \\"Reborn Again\\". Jake Simon, a thirty-three year old lab tech, has a beautiful wife and a baby on the way. Unfortunately, he hates his job and has no money saved up for his expanding family. One night at work, after a massive headache, Jake dies of a brain aneurism. An angelic visitor tries to usher him to heaven, but Jake feels he's left too much undone on earth to enjoy heaven. After a brief discussion, the angel gets permission to give him a second shot at the last fifteen years.<br /><br /> When he awakes, he finds himself back in his eighteen year-old body on the last day of school. But the beautiful thing is he remembers everything that will occur in the next fifteen years! He sees the chance to go back and fix all the mistakes of his past and save the life of a friend who'd been crippled in a shooting Jake had failed to stop.<br /><br /> But terrible things happen when Jake becomes secure in the future. Maybe things aren't as certain as he thought. The high school sweetheart he married is no longer the refined woman he remembered, but an immature teenager. Add the fact he still feels thirty-three and a little strange going out with an eighteen year-old, and the dilemma worsens.<br /><br /> Even his plans for the future don't seem to work out perfectly. Knowing the future money-making stocks to pick sounds perfect-unless you're eighteen with no money. As flawless as the setup seems, it seems like things keep falling apart around him.<br /><br /> Williams does an incredible job with this story. It's not a science-fiction time travel story, despite the way the premise sounds. Instead, this is a character-driven novel full of three-dimensional people with real lives. The events in the story happen logically, and you really feel for Jake as the world falls apart around him even though he tries to make things better.<br /><br /> The ending of the story is great too, with one final plot twist thrown in. Williams is a very talented writer, knowing what to hold back from the reader and what to give away.<br /><br /> Despite being a first-person narrative story (I hate those), I really enjoyed this book. Williams immerses you in the sights and sounds of 1986 (the year Jake wakes up). As a matter of fact, the setting becomes as much a part of the story as the characters themselves. Rather than tell you a hall is full of high school kids, Williams gives you insight into the fashions they are wearing (did I ever wear acid-washed ripped jeans to school? Man, what was I thinking?) and even the music playing. You'll feel like you're watching a John Hughes film here.<br /><br /> In the end, Williams is able to bring everything to a satisfactory and logical conclusion. If you're a child of the 80's, you'll love this story.orld falls apart around him even though he tries to make things better. <br /> <br /> The ending of the story is great too, with one final plot twist thrown in.

Clay Ryker finds himself with the \\"gift\\" of seeing the date of a person's death. Now he has to deal with it! Can he save the person, or is death inevitable for them?<br /><br />Wilson continues to grow as a writer. While I enjoyed \\"Dark To Mortal Eyes\\", I found myself washed away in a tidal wave of characters right at the start. In \\"Expiration Date\\", Wilson paces things better, giving us time to meet the characters and learn about them before introducing another. I felt like I knew the character before they moved on. The action and story line in this one are also set at a faster pace. While DTME set up a sinister plot over time, Expiration Date moves us into action that never wants to let up. The climax of the book is great and really works!<br /><br />One thing: you'll need to have read \\"Dark To Mortal Eyes\\" before this one to understand some of the significance of certain characters and items. It's obvious Eric's slowly building things up to a huge climax at the end of his \\"Five Senses\\" series. We're beginning to see pieces of it fall into place, though I'm betting he's saving the best for last. When you finish this one, you'll want to read his other work anyway, so start at \\"Dark\\" first.<br /><br />All in all, if Wilson's writing continues to improve at the rate it did for this one, you're looking at the next big name in Christian Fiction. Highly recommended for fans of Dean Koontz, Frank Peretti, or Ted Dekker.	2005-05-18

After drifting away from the adventure type story in his last novel, it's glad to see Alton has returned to it--and with a great story idea in the process! Perry Sachs (from two previous novels \\"Beneath the Ice\\" and \\"A Treasure Deep\\") returns, this time seeing his father collapse with a mystery ailment. As his father lay dying, his whispered words to Perry send him on an adventure to a hidden government base his father worked at in the 70's. Unfortunately for Perry, the base is now submerged under water!<br /><br />Alton writes some of the best Christian adventure stories out there, and this one flows nicely from his others. Perry Sachs remains one of my favorite characters in Christian fiction today, and I'm really looking forward to seeing him back in action again in the future. The ending to this novel will set you thinking long after you've turned the last page. Gansky has a gift, and I'm glad he's using it! I highly recommend this book!	2005-03-22

His sister (wanting to be the new Captain Marvel, if he would just give up the name) is still here. We also see the return of Marlo, Magus, Moondragon, and a few other surprises. The main baddie of this story makes it even more intense (not gonna spoil it for you). But let me say, the ending to this storyline is probably the most powerful of any comic in the last decade. What \\"The Death of the Phoenix\\" did for the X-Men, this could have done for Captain Marvel. Unfortunately, by the time this came out the book was well on its way to cancellation, so nobody really caught it.<br /><br />The only downside to this excellent story is the final issue, sort of an \\"Epilogue\\" to the series that really wasn't the least bit necessary. You come out of an incredibly intense storyline, followed by an unforgettable ending, and then they throw this strange light-hearted farewell in there that wasn't necessary. I wish the series had ended one issue sooner. I mean, Genis came back in Thunderbolts #1 (died again, but still...) so it wasn't necessary for the \\"go into the light\\" scenario.<br /><br />All in all, this is the best of the 4 volumes of CM available in this series. It has everything that made the series great: time travel (ala Avengers Forever), great sub-plots, TONS of action, and character growth (again, the ending shows a maturity in Genis that we'd never seen up to that point). I highly recommend it...just skip the final story in it.	2005-02-21

In it, Genis is waaaaay over the edge and has found creative ways to use his new powers. Rick is still trapped in the Microverse and attempting to reach his former friend. In the end, the story tries its best to resolve itself while still leaving enough plot threads hanging to pull you into the next volume. While the whole concept was an interesting diversion, I wasn't really impressed with it. Peter David took the Captain Marvel (Junior) character and really drug him through the mud mentally. So much so that I actually lost any compassion for the guy and couldn't care less whether he got \\"fixed up\\" or not. Granted, the mind-wipe of the Punisher in volume 1 was cool, but not much else happened in these 3 volumes that couldn't have been told in a simple two-or-three issue arc. Recommended for the true fan only. The casual fan might not care for it.	2005-02-18

I was definitely wrong there. This is nothing like that book, though both deal with someone losing someone close to them and wanting to contact them beyond the grave. The title of this one is a little misleading. The whole \\"soul-tracking\\" part doesn't really come until almost the end of the book. There are few surprises in this one except for the death of a major character that I never saw coming in a million years. Sets itself up nicely for a sequel though. As a matter of fact, that's probably the most redeeming part of this book: the plot thread left open begging for a second book (which I'd buy without hesitation). Bill's writing is tight here and keeps you along for the most part, but it does seem to drag just a little in parts. Still, when it takes off, it takes off and you will have a hard time finding a place to put the book down. Recommended.	2004-10-13

This one slipped by me somehow and when I saw it I immediately got it. While the plot is somewhat tight for the most part, I do have some problems with parts of it. For one thing, the thought of a terrorist who will kill someone very close to him (read the book to find out) shouldn't have any qualms about killing millions of others. So why is he so intent on the stones? But the most annoying part of the book is the fact that people call each other by their names so much that it gets old. The minute anything happens, they're all screaming each other's names in the midst of the chaos until you finally just want them to shut up and get on with it. For the first-time emergency, we can live with it...but when something happens every few chapters, you've got to have a break! \\"Daniel!\\" \\"Tyler!\\" \\"Helen!\\" \\"Tyler!\\" \\"Daniel!\\" \\"Dad!\\" \\"Helen!\\" \\"Tyler!\\" Give me a break! Otherwise, a good story...though not up to the same level as \\"Threshold\\" or \\"Blood of Heaven\\" (definitely better than \\"Eli\\" though). Recommended.	2004-10-13

Everything is taken care of in this final book, with the numerous plot threads all neatly tucked in before the final page. Ted Dekker has firmly established himself as one of the best Christian fiction authors out there, and this trilogy will only further cement that sentiment.<br /><br />While Thomas Hunter's story is told, I'd love to see Ted do this again in the future. While I know it has to be exhausting, an in-depth storyline like this is rare in novels today. Great work on this trilogy! Highly recommended.	2004-10-04

Unfortunately, Ray's last collection of new stories, &quot;One More For the Road&quot; was a big disappointment to most Bradbury fans. The stories were depressing and seemed to center around old people facing death and the hopelessness of life...a far cry from the master storyteller we'd grown up with who always seemed to look with wonder toward the uncertain future, anxious to see what new devices and dreams tomorrow might bring. Now we are finally treated to another collection of Ray's stories, all but two of which are presented here for the first time. Most of these stories are from the past, when Ray was in strong form, though the ones from more modern times show promise. As with most short story collections, there are hits and misses here. One of the better stories here is &quot;The Island&quot;, a short study in terror that starts strong and holds its own all the way until the disappointing ending. Still, it's a great look back at when Ray was in his prime. All in all, a good book and recommended for the Bradbury fan.	2004-07-19

I CAN say that they are two good stories, though obviously not the original TZ. For one thing, Rod Serling would never have talked on and on at the beginning of an episode to set it up. Yes, he spoke for about 30 seconds, but then it was over and into the show. The rambling introduction to &quot;Upgrade&quot; was unnecessary to me. Still, the story managed to pull you into it fairly well. &quot;Sensuous Cindy&quot; was ok. Neither story really had the punch of the original, and if this is any indication of the quality of the shows on the new series, it's easy to tell why it got cancelled so quickly.<br />If you're a fan of the TZ and need a fix, this will do. If you're just getting into the series, try one of the Rod Serling originals first.	2004-06-23

The pace literally never stops here, and you'll have a hard time finding a place to put the book down on. Hunter is an interesting character, and I wouldn't mind seeing him again in some other book after this trilogy is done. All in all, Dekker has kept up the plot with this one and I'm looking forward to the last book in the trilogy. Recommended.	2004-06-09

This is one of them. Yes, you'll probably have figured out the identity of the killer long before the main character does, but it still doesn't prepare you for the ending. There are several surprises along the way in this story, and it keeps you turning pages. The opening scene with the crying baby will give you chills.<br />The only downside to this story is the lack of intensity to the goal. Six supercouples are found in Eden, Inc. One by one, they are being killed. Two are dead, and the third is coming quickly, yet you never really get to know the couple at all. The third couple gets a few pages, but otherwise you feel nothing for them. You actually couldn't care less if they live or die, you just want to see how Lash and Tara find the killer. That was a lost opportunity, as I would have liked to felt some sort of high stakes in the game. Instead, it barely rates a blip on the radar. Other than that, this story is solid and enjoyable. Highly recommended.	2004-06-07

She seems to flow seamlessly from one to the next, and she's strong in all of them. Her last book was a romantic comedy, and now we find ourselves deep into the mind of a serial killer and the storm-chaser out to stop him. As in her previous novels, the characters here are realistic and flawed, and it's interesting getting to know them and their quirks. Rene's obviously spent a lot of time preparing and researching for this one, and it shows. And only someone living in the tornado land of Oklahoma could make you appreciate a storm like she can.<br />We haven't seen the last of Mick Kline either. I heard there are supposed to be two other books in this series (at least), and I'm looking forward to them. Highly recommended.	2004-06-04

Foul language wasn't necessary, and the graphic depiction of a man's brains being splattered across the room was never considered. Those were the great days of comics, and the ones represented here.<br />When the Punisher first came out, he wasn't all about killing everyone and everything that moved. Yes, he killed from time to time, but he also used &quot;mercy bullets&quot; that would put an enemy to sleep rather than kill him. Some of the greatest moments of developing the Punisher's character are in this book. Showdowns with Spider-Man (several, with one involving Nightcrawler too), Captain America, and Daredevil are in here. Also, we see the Punisher's first great arch-villian, The Hitman (sort of an evil for-hire version of the Punisher). No, there is no foul language nor huge splatters of blood (and with it being in black-and-white, you couldn't tell anyway), but you get some great stories. From his introduction, to his eventual madness (later explained as drug-induced), this is nothing but fun. The collection ends with the Punisher's first mini-series, and it's a great one. We get to see how other prisoners feel as they see the killer walking among them.<br />Seldom do we get a treat like this one. Most &quot;Essential&quot; collections start with issue one of a character and go from there. Here we are treated to several guest shots in other mags, and it is a great picture. Yes, there are some weak stories (the one involving Cloak and Dagger could have used some touch up), but overall it's a good collection. Probably more enjoyable for the old-time comic fan rather than the ones raised on the uber-violence of today's stories, but good nonetheless. I look forward to the next volume. Highly recommended.	2004-05-26

When I got it yesterday, I devoured it. The first 100 pages give you no let up at all. You can literally feel the end of the world approaching as an evil, foul-smelling rain descends on Molly and Neil's house. What awaits her on the porch and in the garage gives you more of a sense of dread than if actual razor-toothed gremlins were staring up at her. The peace and calm exhibited from everything in this scene of destruction makes it that much more powerful. For the first half of the book, you have several possible answers thrown at you. An emergency broadcast from the space station will give you literal chills.<br />The only thing I didn't enjoy was the ending. As the culprits of this destruction are unveiled, it loses some momentum. While the answer makes sense, you start to lose that sense of &quot;something's out there waiting for me&quot;. Instead, you sort of keep watching from a sense of macabre interest--sort of like driving by a car wreck slowly. Don't get me wrong, there are still plenty of surprises and suspense thrown in, but I think the book would have been much more powerful if we'd been left in the dark just a little longer. The feeling of defeat and utter hopelessness doesn't let up, but the overall fear and dread die away as the revelations come in.<br />All in all, I'm very satisfied with this story though. Highly recommended.	2004-05-25

Unfortunately, I didn't pick the right one to start with.<br />JOL starts out well enough. There is a good mystery, and it definitely keeps you interesting. Then things start to unravel. The truth starts coming out, and bit by bit the story starts becoming more far-fetched. By the time this one is over, you'll be sitting there scratching your head and wondering why your name was left out of this book...after all, everyone else in the world was apparently in on this deception. The closest I can come to explaining this is a soap opera. As the end was revealed, it was like &quot;Your brother-in-law's second cousin's third wife's stepmother was married to my twice-removed uncle's niece's third child's grandson&quot;. It was just too far out to be real.<br />I love a complex story as much as the next guy, but even the most complex plot needs to have SOME grounding in reality--unless it's a Dean Koontz or Stephen King kind of thing. This one just stretchs the believability too far.	2004-05-19
US	53058097	RVQT1HBV9NGMS	1578567440	548390663	Dark to Mortal Eyes	Books	5	16	17	N	N	A great debut novel!	Christian fiction novels tend to have a cookie-cutter feel to them. Most stay away from certain areas, and you feel &quot;safe&quot; reading them. Then Eric Wilson comes along...<br />Describing Eric's storytelling style is a little difficult. The closest I could come to it would be to say reading this book is a lot like reading a Dean Koontz novel. The story is exciting, the descriptions good, and the plot is very deep. There are sections of the book that I got lost in, as a lot of what happens is taking place in the spiritual realm as well. That being the case, you may have to reread parts of the book to get it all. Again, this is because so many Christian fiction novels are similar that you kind of expect a certain formula to one. Once I got my mindset away from that theory, the book worked. This is another reason I compare Eric to Dean Koontz. Both authors can work in the &quot;Is it really happening or not?&quot; realm (see Koontz's &quot;The Face&quot; for a recent example). This is definitely not your momma's Christ Fict. I've heard him compared to Frank Peretti, but I honestly didn't see that. Frank's storytelling is very visual, while Eric's novel had an underlying current of evil running through it that kept you reading and allowed your imagination to do the scary stuff.<br />The only real trouble spot I saw was at the beginning. The first few chapters throw a dozen or so characters at you and it gets hard to keep them apart. Some have similar names or characteristics, and some are only mentioned briefly but then come in later with major parts. Take your time when you start the book or you'll get lost quickly. Also, as I said before, things happen on two realms here. That makes it kind of frustrating at times because you can't understand what's going on (it took me a while to figure out what a &quot;rook&quot; really was).<br />All in all this was a very enjoyable novel, and it sets the standard for a new level of fiction in the Christian market. Just as Shane Johnson gave us the first Christian horror novel last year with &quot;Chayatocha&quot;, Eric takes that baton and runs about eight miles further with it. Now let's just see if the rest of the CBA market can keep up!<br />Highly recommended.hane Johnson gave us the first Christian horror novel last year with &quot;Chayatocha&quot;, Eric takes that baton and runs about eight miles further with it.

It is most definitely NOT for the squeamish, as one very brutal torture scene will cause the strongest person to cringe. The premise was good, and the ending worked.<br />Now, my complaint. Every author has their &quot;pet phrases&quot;, words that appear several times in a single book. It gets annoying when an author describes everything as &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;red&quot; or whatever. Unfortunately, Sandford's favorite word is the &quot;F&quot; word, and it's used in every form possible. Instead of being &quot;very happy&quot;, a person is &quot;F- happy&quot;. Or instead of &quot;really stupid&quot;, they're &quot;F- stupid&quot;. Why be hungry when you can be &quot;F- hungry&quot;? Friend or foe, everyone in Sandford's world uses one word to express themselves. Rather than characters having distinctive voices or phrases, they all sound the same--foul-mouthed and with a limited grasp of the English language. I sincerely doubt the author himself talks like that all the time, so why does he think everyone else does?<br />All in all, this is an interesting story that could have been great. Unfortunately, the unnecessary overuse of profanity detracts from what could have been compelling storytelling. When you see the same word 18 times on a single page (no kidding), it gets old.	2004-05-10

One man against an army of terrorists who hold several hostages, including the man's love interest...sound familiar? Well, it works anyway. This is a fast-paced book that never really slows down once it gets started. Its breathless pace will keep your interest until the end. No, there aren't many surprises here, but the fact that the hero has a broken foot is an interesting twist.<br />There are a few &quot;Oh, come on&quot; moments in here where the hero ignores the obvious solution to a problem and goes for the grand-stand play, but if you can overlook those, you get a great story. Despite its weak points, this is an interesting story and worth the time to read it. Recommended.	2004-04-27
US	53058097	RS7TMLGPPEJ53	0743410165	62211306	The Will	Books	5	2	4	N	Y	A solid story with a great ending	Reed Arvin has done a great job with this novel. The story moves along at a steady pace and really picks up toward the end. As a matter of fact, there really aren't any slow spots in this novel, and that's a major accomplishment for a thriller like this. You really can't call this a \\"legal thriller\\", though some of the action takes place in the court room and the main character is a lawyer. It's not so much about the law as it is about the strange characters that populate the town. Each has their own little secret to hide, and most will keep you guessing until the ending. And the ending...what can I say? The revelations make everything make sense in a way that says \\"Ahhhhh, so THAT'S what was happening!\\".<br />There is profanity sprinkled unnecessarily throughout the story, but it's not to the level of some books out there. When it comes, it's from out of nowhere and it's strong. Be prepared.<br />All in all, this is a great story of faith. It was shopped in the Christian market before Reed gave up and went secular. Obviously the story got some extra treatment after that decision (the language and a sex scene), but it still retains a good \\"moral of the story\\". I enjoyed it much more than his other novel, \\"The Last Goodbye\\". I hope we see more like this one from him in the future.	2004-04-24

Alton introduced the character of Perry Sachs in \\"A Treasure Deep\\", one of his best novels. Now Perry returns with another excavation--but this time the climate isn't quite as cooperative! Something has been found under the Antartic ice, and it could mean trouble! Just like \\"Treasure\\", the mystery continues to unfold about what's down there until they reach it. Again, we see the clues that keep us off balance and unsure of what they've truly found until well into the book. The elements for a great story are here, and I welcome the return of Perry Sachs and his crew.<br />There is the added element of a possible assassin being in the group. This is used to build a good amount of tension, and I liked the way the suspicion flowed around them. The action starts strong and really never slows down. Every time you think you can relax, something unexpected happens. This one moves along at a better pace than his last novel. I hope we see Perry and his crew return soon. My advice: drop the JD Stanton series for a little while and do more stories with Perry. Better yet, have them meet up and put them both in one novel. What a story that would be!<br />Pick this one up. You'll enjoy it. Recommended.	2004-04-20

It's a reasonably good storyline, with a couple of interesting cameos and a good fight scene for Connor against a short killer with amazing abilities. The storyline revolves around a construction site that's being inhabited by a monster. The identity of the monster (and all the others afterward) is supposed to be the big shocker, but if you don't see it coming you aren't trying. Black Lightning makes an appearance here, but Superman has to be credited with possibly the shortest and most convenient cameo I've seen in comics for years. GA is surrounded by 20 or so monsters, suddenly Supes comes from nowhere and ties them all up, then leaves. Sounds almost like a video game using a cheat code or something! He's in the book for one page (literally!), and then he's gone.<br />There's also another problem here. GA is quickly turning into Wolverine. He's this big bad character who supposedly would just as soon kill you as look at you...and yet he never actually kills anyone! He's just sort of turning into a bully in the DC universe.<br />Another problem is his involvement with one of the female characters. He's in love with the Black Canary--he comes back from the dead and is still in love with her, for crying out loud!--and yet he throws it all away for a one-night stand. What in the world is up with that? Why aren't they developing this character more?<br />All in all, this story had enough interesting points to make it worth reading. Unfortunately it doesn't really progress GA's character that much, and the ending is a little subdued for the rest of the book's hype. Still, I'm glad to see another GA collection and would buy the next. Mildly recommended.	2004-04-09

It started slow, but then picked up quite nicely beforing coming to a crashing halt toward the end. The climax of this book is actually a philosophical discussion between a man and a computer. Read that again. A tense situation is going on around them, but a 50 page philosophical discussion about the existence of God is the climax of this book. Anytime the tension or action starts, we switch back to the discussion and everything grinds to a halt.<br />All in all, this book has to be one of the most uneven I've read in a long time. Avoid this one.	2004-03-25

This book is not only a story, but a teaching/warning to most everyone who has a problem with their thought life. While the focus of this book is primarily the battle in the mind against lust, the message can be applied to any bad thoughts or addictions of any kind (yes, lust and pornography can be addictions). If you allow something to begin in your mind, it will only grow worse and cause problems.<br />This book shows the life of two main characters. Doug is a father and husband who finds himself battling with his thought life and losing. Ronnie is a girl whose dreams of college seem impossible...until the opportunity to use her body for money opens the door. Both have people praying for them, and both are pawns in a much bigger scheme.<br />Shaunti's writing is stark and real, and she pulls no punches with the reality of pain surrounding the battles of the flesh. The most amazing thing is the fact that she can cover such a subject in a novel so thoroughly and yet never stray into making the book explicit in any way. All of the scenes are implied, while the consequences are plain. I haven't seen such truthful writing in a long time. I highly recommend this novel!	2004-03-24

This is his third novel (&quot;The Will&quot; and &quot;Wind in the Wheat&quot; are the others), but it's the first of his I've read, and I was impressed. From the beginning, it has all the elements of a good book. The protagonist starts out with a death that's his fault in a way, and it haunts him. From that point on, the book is truly a ride. If you haven't read the other reviews and details about the book, don't! Just buy it and read it, completely obvlivious to where it's going and what's going on. Instead, find yourself lost in the maze of twists and turns the author throws out. It's much more enjoyable that way.<br />The characters are all well done, for the most part. I think the book ended well also, which is a good thing. I'll agree with someone else that part of the ending was a little far-fetched (and hard to understand if you don't know anything about the stock market...you'll be lost and wonder what's going on). That's the only real gripe I have with the book. Not everyone is a day-trader, so the significance of what's happening will be lost to many readers.<br />If you're looking for another John Grisham, you won't find it here. Reed Arvin writes in his own style, and while the hero is a lawyer, it means little to the storyline. This is not a legal thriller by any stretch of the imagination. It's just a good story that's told well. Recommended.	2004-03-23

This collects issues 31-37 of Exiles, and it covers some great moments for the team. First off, they face a world where the Avengers are all vampires (as a result of Captain America losing to Baron Blood in an earlier battle in his own comic). Their only hope it to enlist the aid of Union Jack, but he doesn't want to get involved!<br />Next we go to two issues where the leaps go wrong for some reason. Sasquatch and Morph end up facing a crazed Weapon X in the Canadian wilderness. This is a good story because it gives emotional depth to Heather and gives her backstory. It's surprising. Meanwhile, Nocturne and Sunfire end up back on the Legacy Virus world. This is a pretty uneventful story, and definitely drags down the pace of the book. Coming dead center of the whole thing, it's unfortunate.<br />Finally, we end the book with a three-issue arc involving the birth of the Fantastic Four--except this time Ben Grimm isn't normal from the change! For two issues, they go after him to save New York, and just when things settle down, the final issue of the book finds them facing one of their own! This is the strongest issue to come from the series in a while, and before it's all over, one member will be dead and a familiar face will join the team.<br />All in all, this is a good collection. The art is good, and the characters are developed well. The only complaint I can give is to the Sunfire story in the middle that is a rather boring attempt to give the character a life. The beginning and end of the book are great though, so don't let the lag stop you from purchasing it.	2004-03-16

This is the type of novel that keeps me coming back to Alton Gansky's work. When you think you finally see where this is going (ala Kevin Bowen's &quot;Wil's Bones&quot; or Paul Maier's &quot;Skeleton in God's Closet&quot;), you're wrong! The storyline keeps a fairly consistent pace throughout. You'll come up with a dozen theories as to what the &quot;Treasure&quot; in the title is, but by the end you'll realize you weren't even close. I highly recommend this novel as an example of what Mr. Gansky can do when he's &quot;on&quot;. If this is your first experience with his work, then follow it up with &quot;The Prodigy&quot; or &quot;Vanished&quot;.	2004-03-16

In it, one major character finds their job complete and they get to go home. This opens the door for another character to join (a familiar face from another comic) and the dynamic of the team changes drastically. They face a world taken over by the Legacy Virus where Warlock from the New Mutants and Doug Ramsey combine into one being...and then evolve! The other heroes from this world are taken over (ala the Borg from Star Trek) and it's up to the Exiles to stop them.<br />Of the released sets so far, this one ranks well. It's not the best of the series, but anytime they lose a member it's hard. This time is no exception. Recommended.	2004-03-16

This collection is hit-and-miss, with some stories being quite good while others are a little more in need of polishing. The writing is done with a very casual style, sort of like you're being told the story in person, which has its good and bad points. A few of the stories have a twist ending, though some don't really have a stong payoff.<br />All in all, I enjoyed many of the stories very much, while others left me ready to turn the page. I'll have to say, the ones that are good are VERY good. If you like short stories, then this is definitely a buffet of different styles, but I'm afraid few people will like them all.	2004-03-11

This is a compilation of several issues of the Green Arrow comic book series. The thing that makes these particular issues special is the fact that it was written by Brad Meltzer (&quot;The Millionaires&quot;, &quot;The Zero Game&quot;, etc). This is one incredibly amazing book! Green Arrow has just come back from the dead (don't they all?) and now has some unfinished business to take care of. Along the way, we see the return of a grown-up Speedy (now Arsenal) helping GA collect artifacts from his life. Most are surprising, and a couple are very puzzling as to their meaning--until the end of the book. I don't want to go into details because that's part of what makes the story so great.<br />We get to see a new side of the Emerald Archer here too, with a return to the things of the past that can bring back some memories for those of us who read the old series and remember his original JLA days. At one point, he even takes on Solomon Grundy with nothing but his bare hands and two arrows (you've got to read it to believe it--it's incredible!). As an added bonus, you get the script to the first issue, as well as Brad's original pitch for the storyline (it's different from the book, and it's good that he improved on it for the actual series).<br />All in all, I can't recommend this one highly enough. It's got everything you could ever look for in a comic book story, including the most startling plot twist ending I've read in a long time.

In recent years, he's branched out into acting and now he's writing. This is his second novel (the novelization for \\"The Champion\\" was his first), and it's a good run.<br />The premise is good. An Ultimate Fighting Championship type fighter escapes into the witness protection program and ends up losing his cover. The Russian mafia comes after him and he has to use his skills to protect himself and the woman he's growing to love.<br />The characters here are good, and it's obvious that Carman's a talented guy. The middle lags just a bit, but it ends well. It's an action-packed story for the most part though. All in all, this is a satisfying read, and I think Carman succeeded in what he set out to do. He may not win over any new fans with this one, but he's going to keep his old ones happy.	2004-03-10
US	53058097	R6ELUY2FWFQAV	1593100515	753462414	Chayatocha	Books	4	1	1	N	Y	Good start	I loved the beginning of this book! It was creepy and gave me this sense of foreboding that absolutely got to me. But then as we learned more about Chayatocha and the origins behind the creature, it lost steam. The climax in the cave was good (though most of the action is limited to what the lead character hears rather than sees), but the tone of the book was different by then. The novel starts as a horror/thriller story, then ends as more of a spiritual warfare kind of thing (and that's not necessarily bad).<br />I will definitely have to give the author credit for one of the more powerful scenes involving the crucifixion in recent fiction. That was the highlight of the book's second half to me.<br />All in all, this was satisfying, and I'm looking forward to Mr. Johnson's next novel (hopefully the sequel to &quot;Ice&quot;!). If he goes in this vein again in the future, I have no doubt it'll be another hit. The ending doesn't deliver what the beginning promises, but I recommend it because it's the first of its kind in Christian fiction. I hope other authors will build upon it.	2004-03-09

Stanton series set the bar high in my opinion. Mr. Gansky is one of my favorite Christian authors, and I was eagerly anticipating another thriller in the same vein--and this was close. The story is good, the concept is unique, and the ending works. The thing I missed was the intrigue of &quot;Vanished&quot; and &quot;A Ship Possessed&quot;. This one seemed to lag just a little at the beginning, but it does pick up speed as it goes on. I guess it just seems a little too close to &quot;A Ship Possessed&quot; to stand on its own (both involve old ships coming from the ocean looking as new as when they were made). And while ASP had strange noises and good atmosphere, this one had visions of people on deck. Still, this was a good novel, and if it's the first you've read of Mr. Gansky's, then it's strong enough to prompt you to read another. For a follow up, go for &quot;The Prodigy&quot; or &quot;A Treasure Deep&quot; next. Neither are one of this series of books, but they're STRONG storytelling and shows the range this author can reach. As always, I'll be eagerly awaiting the next Gansky novel, and I recommend this one.	2004-03-09
US	53058097	R1NBRPNPKPSC2G	0310243882	365961091	Deadlock	Books	4	7	10	N	N	Enjoyable for legal thriller fans	The first book by James Scott Bell I read was &quot;Blind Justice&quot;. It was a fast-paced book that was heavy on action, and it held my attention. &quot;Deadlock&quot; was the second one I read, and it was a very different novel. While &quot;Blind Justice&quot; could be considered a legal thriller, &quot;Deadlock&quot; would have to be more of a character study. There's honestly not a lot of action here, nor is there a lot of courtroom action (one subplot deals with an abortion case, but it has the majority of court time in the book), but there is a lot of character growth. The change in Millie is believable and paced well, and I have to say doing it any differently would have been a little too &quot;fictionalized&quot; for my taste. I only have two complaints, one major and one minor. The only true down spot I didn't like was the ending. There was an undercurrent of unrest in the Supreme Court with her change, and she makes a decision and gets help for it...then changes her mind a few chapters later. We are set up for an awesome showdown, and then it never happens. I realize that it was making a statement about her character and belief in the court, but it still seemed to cheat us just a little. The only other minor complaint is that one of the characters is described as looking like Denzel Washington, and that just never sits well with me. I think the fun of a novel is deciding your own players for the parts in your head, and when an author goes ahead and tells us who's playing this character, it sort of robs the fun of it. It's sort of like he's saying &quot;I don't feel like describing this character, so here's who it is.&quot; I'm not saying that was Mr. Bell's intent, but it's a matter of personal preferences. Another novel I read did that for every single character (&quot;This guy looks like a young Harrison Ford,&quot; and &quot;She looked like Sharon Stone&quot;), and I haven't liked it since. Again, that's just a minor complaint and I didn't even take that into consideration while rating this book. Other than that, there's not a lot to complain about. The revealed identity of one of the characters caught me completely by surprise, and I have to give a thumbs-up for that one. It fit perfectly into the story, and it made another character's decision late in the book make sense. I'll definitely be picking up more of Mr. Bell's books in the future, and I recommend this one.hat into consideration while rating this book. Other than that, there's not a lot to complain about.

The idea is that a secret service agent fails and a presidential candidate is killed. Years later, the mastermind behind the killing is back and wants to kill the agent, who is now retired and trying to get on with his life. Another agent loses her candidate altogether, and now we have the beginnings of the story. There are some tangled moments here, but overall this is a good story. The only thing I didn't really care for was the ending. It seemed a little too comic-bookish. Why does the character stand in one spot rather than do the smart thing and move around to protect himself and his charge? Still, I enjoyed the book and would read the sequel.	2004-03-05

Blind Justice was my first exposure to James Scott Bell, and I have to say I was impressed. While there were definitely a few places he could have &quot;upped&quot; the suspense, overall it was a good story. I read it over the course of two days and found it hard to put down once it really got started. Some folks don't appreciate his comparisons to John Grisham, but I consider it a compliment for him. If you are into legal thrillers, then this is definitely one you'll want to pick up. The very concept of a lawyer having a mentally handicapped client who swears the devil came into the room and killed his wife should be enough to keep most readers hooked (I know it was enough for me). The ending is good, and the main character's evolution from start to finish is believable. All in all, I recommend this one. It was definitely good enough to warrant reading another one of his books.	2004-03-05
US	53058097	R266VQOBXGMOQC	0312319142	298733702	Paranoia	Books	4	5	7	N	Y	Highly enjoyable!	I enjoyed this book. Let's get that out of the way and move on. A lot of people are saying they thought it was standard fare or had potential, but I thought Paranoia was well written. The concept of someone being planted in another company to steal their secrets isn't a new one, but this novel brings a new angle by making the main character basically nothing more than a con man who has no idea what he's doing in the job and has to bluff his way out of everything. I admit that I was becoming a bit skeptical halfway through the book with how it was all working so well for him, but then I was completely satisfied with the ending. I'll have to say I never saw the twist ending coming (and that's saying a lot since novels of this type are pretty cut-and-dry). There were a few slow places in the book, but not many. If you decide to read the book, let me give you this warning: before you complain that some of the characters seem too good or bad to be true, remember that not everything you read is at it seems. Be prepared for several surprises along the way. I highly recommend this book, with my only reservation being the excessive use of profanity by Wyatt that made him seem more of an idiot than a CEO.	2004-03-05

When an author wants to break from a popular character, there's always the possibility of scepticism from the readers. Some authors are able to make this work (Jeffrey Deaver, for example). Others fall flat, as Mr. Kellerman has on this one. I honestly don't know what happened here. This is perhaps the slowest paced novel I've ever read from a veteran author. How this ever got past his agent or editor I'll never know. You are well over halfway through the book before anything happens, and I'm not exaggerating here in the least. It's almost like following someone's boring life with morbid curiousity for a while, waiting for something to go wrong. The ending, when it mercifully comes, isn't worth the build up. The Conspiracy Club from the book's title really doesn't do anything that a single character couldn't have done. It's like this is a novel he'd written years ago but put away and suddenly he had a deadline and had to grab it. The potential for a great story was here, but it would have meant losing the first half of the book and starting from there. I look forward to his next novel, but I hope it'll be back to his old standard of great storytelling.	2004-03-03

I started reading just a few pages in it and couldn't stop until it was over. If you know someone who is going through problems or seriously considers giving up on life, this is the book they should read. If you are a counselor or pastor and must speak to hurting people, this is the book you should read. If you've ever found yourself at the end of your rope just wanting a few minutes of peace from the hectic, stressful everyday routine of life, this is for you. Pastor Mark is truthful and realistic in the stories he tells and the examples he uses both from his own life and the lives of others. This is truly a hard feat to accomplish properly, as there is a fine line between encouraging someone with your story, and turning it into a pity-party. Pastor Mark definitely succeeds in the former. Even though the struggles he mentions are hard, he's always pointing to the God who makes it possible to live through them. This book is harsh reality with hope. I still find myself thinking about points made often. I can't recommend it highly enough. You need this one.	2004-02-15

I have to be honest here...this is the best book I've read this year, and I've read a ton of them. One thing: this one bears several similarities to a recent Hollywood thriller that came out a couple of months ago, so the ending was a little familiar. However, since I know it takes a long time to write a novel, I have no doubt that Mr. Dekker was working on this even before that movie came out. Still, this is a major thriller, and I have to say that it remains tense throughout. It's very easy to see this one as a possible movie someday, and you can tell Ted's really coming into his own with his voice as a thriller writer. I highly recommend it!	2003-06-20
US	53058097	R1LJTSQODHF7EI	0312288123	307710845	Sensei: A Thriller	Books	3	4	5	N	Y	Good, but missing the action	This is a great thriller, let me say that first up. If you're wanting a suspense novel, this is a good choice, but if you're expecting incredible action throughout it, you're going to be disappointed. The premise is fantastic: great martial artists are being killed by a superior warrior. You can easily see Jet Li playing the part of Ronin in this one. The problem is that this story is told from the first-person perspective (&quot;I walked into the room and...&quot;). While this wouldn't be a problem if you were telling it from the killer's POV, it's a big disappointment if you're telling it from someone else's. As a result, we see the aftermath of the three killings (the body, the crime scene, etc.), but what could have been a series of incredible fight scenes are never developed. In actuality, there are only two real fight scenes in the whole book (one more if you count one told in retrospect), and that's just not what you expect from a book about martial arts masters being killed. Ronin is only seen fighting in one scene in the end, and even that one is cut rather short for a guy who's supposed to be such an incredible fighter. I enjoyed the book, but it was definitely more about character development than action (imagine John Woo directing &quot;High Noon&quot; and you'll get the idea). If this had been told differently (from the third person perspective of most books...or even from the combination of the two like James Patterson does with the Alex Cross stories), it could have been a blockbuster. As it is, it's very informative (the author obviously knows what he's talking about) and full of suspense, but still missing something. I'll gladly grab his next one though and give it another try, as he shows great potential as a fiction writer.	2003-06-11

This is a great Christie story and the final Poirot tale (despite the fact that it obviously takes place before &quot;Curtain&quot; it was published afterward). Despite the fact that it was originally a play and is therefore limited in location (most of it takes place in one room), it still comes across as good. The major complaint I have is that the murderer is revealed in the first cassette by telling what they do. On the stage as this was originally intended to be presented, the action would have been subtle amongst the other things happening on stage at the time and most folks probably would have missed it, but presented as this audiobook the action is trumpeted loudly and the rest of the time you're just waiting for the ending to come. The cat and mouse game Poirot plays with the killer is good and I can just imagine the theatre-goers holding their breath at that final exchange, but the rest of the book just doesn't cut it. Still, if you keep in mind that it was originally intended for the stage (and I think Ms. Christie would have omitted that telling detail if SHE had written it as a book) you can see where it would have been a smash hit.	2003-06-03

Unfortunately, it starts to slow down in the middle and the ending is unsatisfying. Basically, it seems like Mr. Long just got tired of writing the book and decided to end it. The payoff you're waiting for (and I won't go into it here because I don't want to spoil the ending for you) never occurs. It all just suddently wraps itself up neat and tidy - game over. While this could be excused for a short story, a huge novel like this deserves more. I have to admit that the character development of Ian and his wife are realistic, and I loved the way things turned out for them at the end. The picnic director/planner was another great character, but he was only in a few pages. If you're looking for a great suspense novel, there are certainly many suspenseful pages in here - but don't look for a satisfactory payoff on all of it. If you're looking for a good story about a man's wrestling with his faith in view of his old life, you've found it here. I mean, think about it: if Stephen King became a Christian, what would he do about his writing? Definitely worth a read for that aspect of it alone.	2003-03-24

The story here is good, but what really makes this great is the way it's read.  David Kaye does the best job I've ever heard of perfectly imitating the character's voices (with the exception of Sulu - still need to work on that one).  There are times when you honestly think the original crew came back together to record this adventure, and it really adds to the story.

How unfortunate for us, because this would have made the perfect sequel to Star Trek 4.  As a matter of fact, it picks up just after the end of the movie and really is good.  The character development is good, and the plot moves along well.  It's sad to think we'll never get to see this one on the screen, but at least we're treated to a good conclusion to the origins of the mysterious probe from Star Trek 4.

The author does a great job of throwing enough technical jargon in to make it seem realistic, all the while not flooding you with enough to make you feel ignorant.  I was a little confused toward the end, but when it finally dawned on me what was happening I was very satisfied with it.  I did have some problems though with a civilization being advanced enough to get on the moon, but not advanced enough to deal with the situation that provided the climax of the book.  Doesn't make much sense really.  I do applaud the author's creativity though, and really enjoyed his idea of what things MIGHT have been like.  There are some rough parts in places to wade through, but for the most part it's a real page-turner that keeps your interest all the way until the end.  I love a book that just starts with a bang and doesn't start with chapters upon chapters of character introductions and backgrounds, and this one delivers!  We meet our heroes as it looks like they're experiencing their last days on earth, and from there it just gets better.

All of his sci-fi short stories, his &quot;Ray Bradbury Theater&quot; tv shows, stories made into movies, etc, are favorites of mine.  Whenever I take a trip, I usually try and grab a couple of his short story collections to enjoy (even when I've already heard them).  I picked this up fully expecting to be entertained as I had been for years (despite a few slow-moving collections released in recent years).  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  It's not that I was expecting &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; (ok, maybe I was HOPING that would be the case), but there were literally only a COUPLE of stories in the whole book worth reading!  &quot;The Enemy in the Wheat&quot; to me was the best story, and it's just a short story with a cute twist and not a sci-fi one (there is one in the collection, by the way).  It's obvious that Ray Bradbury is dealing with his own mortality in this collection, with more than one story revolving around a character dealing with people from his distant past, or ghosts of the past, or decisions made about friendships in the past and such.  It's as if the muse he had drawn upon so much in the early years of his career had left and sent it's grandfather to keep him company.  Mr. Bradbury seems to be glaring over the twilight of his life and speaking of the regrets he has in certain areas.  All in all, this is a strange collection of unrelated tales, and if it were released by any other author it would have been ignored altogether.  But thank you, Mr. Bradbury, for continuing to write well past the age others are retired and playing golf.  I hope your writing room is still full of those wonderful toys you kept there, and I hope that you let your younger self out to play a little more in the next collection.	2002-06-21

It does seem to start a little slow, but once the momentum goes, it flies!  Money well spent!	2002-02-07

It was a cliffhanger, and I hate those, but you couldn't deny it was a good novel.  &quot;Violets Are Blue&quot; literally picks up seconds after the other novel's end, and goes for a good ride from that point on.  The beginning is gripping, and the end is by far one of the best Patterson has ever written.  The middle is the problem.  For one thing, The Mastermind's identity isn't &quot;revealed&quot; in this one until the last quarter of the book - even though it was clearly stated in the last one - so you are supposed to act surprised at the revelation (I guess if you didn't read the other book, it would be a surprise).  For another thing, the vampire/S&amp;M storyline just gets too graphic for no reason.  The sex/murder scenes just are more than we need to know.  Some of the best parts of the book are at the beginning when the couple is found murdered and you try to figure what happened.  When we stand bedside while people are graphically killed, the imagination doesn't have to go anywhere - so I feel some of the middle is too over-the-top.  However, I have to say that the last quarter of the book (after the vampire storyline is over) is the best.  When it's just Alex Cross versus The Mastermind, it's incredible work!  Characters from all the previous novels get cameos or mentions (including a cameo from one of the better female characters in the series - Kate McTiernan).  As the Mastermind goes after those in Cross' life to kill them while Cross tries to stop him, it's stuff that you can't put down.  You'll be reading this one late into the night, that's for sure.  Unfortunately, within the first few pages you can easily tell where this will all end up and what Cross' next life-move will be, but it still makes for a good story.  Almost 5 stars, but the vampire killings are just too bloody graphic for my taste.	2001-11-02

This Bible is designed for your personal study in mind.  The margins are perfect for writing notes in, the study aids are nicely placed and not so much as to make the Bible too big to carry to church or work, and the questions asked and things to notice on each page help things stand out that might have slipped by you.  Of all the Bibles I own (and that's a lot), this is the one I use nightly for my personal devotion time and the one I carry to church with me weekly.  If you were affected by the book &quot;Experiencing God&quot; (one you should buy immediately if you don't already own it) and found the insights in it to be life-changing, then this Bible is the natural next step for you.  The only thing that could have made it slightly better might have been a few more quotations from the book in back, but that just a personal preference and doesn't detract from this great study Bible.	2001-10-04

The idea of finding the &quot;bones of Jesus&quot; was done almost a decade ago by Paul Maier in &quot;A Skeleton in God's Closet&quot;, and it was done better.  Mr. Maier's book took time to carefully weave a reason for everything, and the end results of the world's reactions to the discovery were so chilling at times it was scary.  This book follows a slightly similar storyline, except the main character is antagonistic toward Christianity in general to the point that it makes it hard to sympathize with him.  Most characters are quickly introduced and thrown into the plot and we are forced to learn about them along the way.  The end result is that we end up finally getting to know the person right before the book ends.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the book and it was a great read - and if I'd never read the earlier book by Mr. Maeir I would have probably given it much higher stars...instead, I sort of saw this as a TV movie rather than blockbuster.  Still I recommend you give it a read.  It's a great book for those nights curled up in front of the fireplace.	2001-09-27

After starting well in book one, and then slowly down to a crawl in book two,book three lets loose with some of the best story telling in the book series!  Q faces an enemy more powerful than himself (a storyline touched on in Peter David's incredible &quot;Q-Squared&quot;), but this time he is trapped aboard the Enterprise and must play a sadistic game of &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; against his enemy, O.  The storyline involving the female Q and baby q was equally gripping, as they faced the Betazoid professor now enhanced by the Galactic Barrier (as happened to Gary Mitchell in the original series episode &quot;Where No Man Has Gone Before&quot;).  The story races along incredibly well, and makes up for the horrible sluggishness of the second book in the series.  Definitely not one to miss!	2001-08-15

Any time they put out a trilogy, almost inevitably the second book is just a lot of filler to justify calling it a trilogy (&quot;Dark Victory&quot; is another classic example).  This whole trilogy would have made an excellent hardcover, and they could have disposed of almost all of this second book.  Riker and the crew fight desperately and aimlessly against the Calamarain (a fight that would have been over in 3 chapters tops in other books).  Q and Picard watch the fall of the Tkon empire (again, something that merits no more than a couple of chapters...but stretches through the entirety of this book).  Nothing in this book merits a whole book.  You'll have to skim through it to keep up with what happens in the third (go straight to the last few chapters - it's where the important stuff comes in), but you'll have to fight to let it keep your interest.  Fortunately, the next book is the best of them and really keeps things going like a great ST book should.  Hey, I'm a huge Q fan, and that's all that kept me reading this one to the end.	2001-08-10

It's the introduction of the New Frontier group, and it has some good characters.  Now, the bad part: Joe Morton's reading.  He does superb with several of the voices, but unfortunately when he's reading the part of Mackenzie Calhoun, he totally goes out of the character in the book.  Rather than the intense yet casual hero the book calls for, Joe reads him by enuciating each-and-every-word-as-slowly-and-clearly-as-possible.  This wouldn't be a big problem except for the fact that Calhoun is the hero of the book!  That being the case, it gets annoying verrrrry quickly.  But I have to say that his &quot;Spock&quot; and &quot;Picard&quot; voices are dead-on.  If you can handle the parts of the audio book that sound like a &quot;Speak English in 10 Easy Lessons&quot; section, you'll enjoy the story.	2001-08-07

Unfortunately, it has some trouble spots in the story.  First of all, the story starts out incredibly slow and slightly confusing.  Once you pick up on what's going on (basically, when Sulu comes in), it gets better.  It IS a good story, and it's great to see Captain Sulu in action again...it's just too bad it takes some getting used to to really enjoy it.	2001-08-02

You write a book of filler!  Tiberius, who makes a surprise appearance at the end of Spectre, puts in a wonderful cameo here at the beginning and end of the book.  In the middle, we are left with Kirk's life, and a hint of something strange happening on Deep Space 9 with Dr. M'Benga.  In all honesty, there's really nothing in this book that demands an entire volume.  Yes, Kirk's wedding is in here (who would have thought THAT could happen?), but it just sort of gets fuzzy from there.  The mirror Picard and NextGen crew put in a brief appearance at the beginning, and then they are gone too.  It's like the whole concept of the mirror universe loses it's appeal after the first book, and they decide to try something different.  Janeway, who played such a big part of the first book, is quickly used here and then doesn't even show up in &quot;Preserver&quot;.  All in all, not a big winner, in my opinion.	2001-07-26

In it's defense, it's better than &quot;Dark Victory&quot;.  I think I would have liked this book better if I felt Kirk in danger, but there's really no worry of that.  I have to applaud Judith and Garfield (who really believes William Shatner had anything to do with writing this?  Ever seen Star Trek 5?) for killing off a main character in the end of the book.  That was indeed a shocker, coming out of left field from nowhere.  And the epilogue of the book shows us several years into the future with the character still dead, so we are led to believe they are gone for good.  Unfortunately, in the Star Trek universe where nobody ever stays dead, we know that somehow they'll be back (possibly by some quantum interference of an ion storm on a transporter beam caused by a Borg/Ferengi alliance instigated by a rebel Romulan faction with a personal vendetta against the Federation's acceptance of the Klingon empire who have spies throughout the galaxy plotting the overthrow of the Cardassian scum - or something like that).  Oh, and how does a ruthless tyrant like Tiberius, the bloody dictator of the mirror universe, suddenly become a warm-hearted fuzzy guy so quickly?  At any rate, it was a good book, but I'm not looking forward to another 3-year trilogy.  How about putting out the next books 6 months apart so we don't get completely lost and bored by the constant cliffhangers?	2001-07-26

This set is good because it includes what has been considered the best show of the series: &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot;.  The story was so popular that Agnes Moorehead actually had to come back and redo it 4 times over the years Suspense was on the air (and even recorded it into album form because of it's popularity).  In today's stories, it might not grab you like it did the folks back then, but it's still good and it shows what an amazing actress Ms. Moorehead was (rather than Sabrina's gaudy mother on &quot;Bewitched&quot;).

I know that &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; was considered the best show of the series, but GH was MUCH creepier.  It's the kind of episode you'll want to enjoy best at home with all the lights off (but don't be surprised if you don't last the whole time that way).  Some 50 years before &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, we're treated to the story of two men who spend the night in a haunted house with a tape recorder running the whole time...imagine the possibilities.  Another great story from this anthology is Lucille Ball's story &quot;A Little Piece of Rope&quot;.  This story just shows how much of a dramatic actress Lucy could be, and it has an awesome twist ending that was the calling card of the series.  All the other stories are treats too.  I highly suggest buying this one and going on to the rest in the series as soon as possible.	2001-07-11

Grisham writes a novel with no lawyers and courtrooms, and Peretti writes a teen novel.  Unfortunately, unlike Grisham (who puts out a novel every February, so we know we just have to wait until next year to see something new), Peretti's sporadic writing style leaves us to wonder when we'll ever see another novel from him.  This book claims to be first in a series, so does that mean his adult readers just have to hang it up for a while?  Please say it isn't so!  To be fair, this book was good.  The story wasn't as deep as his other works, but he wasn't aiming at the audience his other works had seen...this is going back to his &quot;Cooper Kids&quot; roots.  It had an &quot;X-Files&quot; kind of quality to it throughout, and it could have easily been adapted into a much longer, more in-depth (and better) novel.  The premise is good, and the final revelation of what's going on is worth the wait (Peretti never lets you down on the climax of one of his books).  I'd recommend it to a young teenager, as the &quot;moral of the story&quot; (don't pick on those who are different from you) is a good one.  Still, I hope Mr. Peretti's next novel is back to the adult standards of &quot;The Visitation&quot; or &quot;This Present Darkness&quot;.  Please don't forget about your adult readers, Mr. Peretti!  We love to see your name in print too!	2001-02-20

This book is amazing, and Tommy Nelson teaches it in plain english and doesn't resort to &quot;preacherspeak&quot; so many other authors go for.

In all honesty, this book is probably about 3,000 ideas/quotes you'll find use for (still a good number), but most of the things in here are either rephrases of an earlier idea or some useless junk (do we really need to know what the top 5 love songs of 1955 were?).  There are a number of good ideas, it's just a matter of wading through the bad ones to get to it.  I think Mr. Godek's best bet would have been to make it a smaller number of ideas and make them all gems, rather than go for such a grand number knowing good and well he'd have to put a LOT of filler in there.  There are better romantic idea books out there, but this would be a good one to look at if you're in the bookstore and have some time to kill.  I WILL say that it was a neat idea to give several key phrases in several languages (&quot;I love you&quot;, &quot;You're sexy&quot;, etc).	2001-01-29

The ending of &quot;Pop&quot; was so contrived and far-fetched that it was pathetic.  This one has a good ending, but I hate cliff-hangers.  The Mastermind performs a final act of brutality (killing off one of the main characters in the process) and then he's revealed - and the revelation is mind-blowing.  It won't mean much to you if this is your first Alex Cross novel, so read some of the others first, and then come back and read this.  I have to give Mr. Patterson credit for one of the better plot twists of the past few years.  Still, you feel robbed when you finish this because it doesn't actually end - the bad guy gets away.  Hopefully the Mastermind will meet with a much more exciting end than Gary Soneji did in &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot;.  He's one of the more exciting villians Patterson has come up with.  All in all, a good book, but I'd advise waiting until the next Cross novel comes out so you can find a satisfying end to the story.	2000-12-29

These guys make a great team, and never seem to disappoint...until now.  Don't get me wrong, this book is great and you'll definitely finish it  quickly, but there are several differences in this book compared to others  that sort of don't sit well...most noticeably, the ending.  One of the main  characters - who has exhibited strong character throughout the book -  suddenly loses it at the end (I'm not spoiling anything for you, as there  are so many characters to follow here, you'll be lucky to guess which one),  which is totally opposite of how they've been portrayed throughout the  book.  As in every Preston/Child book, there are a lot of characters in the  story, and you're well-aware that a number of them are there specifically  for some horrible death.  I'm going to reserve comment on the rest of the  ending besides just saying there needs to be a sequel somewhere to tie up  the loose end.  Still, an excellent read and well worth the time and money.	2000-07-27

The Shafer storyline ends very satisfactorily (I wish Mr. Smith from &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot; had had the same end), but the Alex Cross storyline freaks at the end.  It appears to be ending as it should  and as would be natural, then all of the sudden we are taken for one final  plot twist that is supposed to be believeable, but just turns out to be  ridiculous.  I guess it just goes to show that no friend of Alex Cross'  ever needs to worry about facing any permanent consequences in their lives.  For the next book, why not kill off a major character just to show us that  someone can actually die in these storylines, therefore building up tension  - rather than have us saying &quot;Well, I don't care HOW many times he's  been shot, stabbed, hanged, and pulled behind a moving car for 8 miles,  this guy is a friend of Alex's and he's gonna pull through...ho hum.&quot;  Hey, does this mean there's hope for us to see Gary Siniji and Mr. Smith  again?  I mean, just pull them out of the same Twilight Zone this ending  came from.  In all honesty, the storyline was great, the villian was great,  the villian's storyline climax was great, 95% of this book was great...but  when Alex's storyline takes the final plot twist in Jamaica, it's just too  far-fetched to believe.

When I heard it was a combination of two of his earlier books (Fire of Heaven, and Threshold), I was excited because I loved both.  However, to find that  the innocent hero of one book (Fire of Heaven) is now the evil villian of  another was hard to accept.  Though the character change was explained, it  was not sufficiently justified.  It was nice to see Brandon mature from  &quot;Threshold&quot; and become the prophet he was called to be though.  My big question is &quot;Will there be another sequel?&quot;  The book  doesn't end necessarily as a cliffhanger, but there are so many dangling  plot threads that you have to wonder if he's just leaving those there for  the imagination or if he's planning on tying it all up in a last  installment of the series.  Of course, it would be very hard to make  another book of this (you'll understand why when you read it), but it could  be done.  To fully appreciate the book, you need to read the other two  first though.  All in all, a good book with a good (though, at times,  disturbing) plot and it's well-paced throughout - but it just leaves too  much &quot;out there&quot; at the end.  If there's another book in the  series, I'll read it without hesitation.  Maybe then that will help this  one sit better as far as a story goes.  As far as the message IN the story,  THAT stands on it's own and no one should comment on that!	1999-09-03

This one took me longer to get around to, but am I glad I did!  Thank you so much, Mr. Grisham, for not portraying the Christians in your  book as wild-eyed Bible-beating lunatics, but instead portraying them as  human beings following a different path.  I highly recommend this book.  While it lags a little in the middle, it is all in all fabulous - much  better than Street Lawyer.  I'm looking forward to the next one!	1999-08-10

I bought the &quot;Windows NT for dummies&quot; book and was incredibly disappointed.  It was written for the person who had never seen a computer before, and barely touched on networking!  When I saw this one, I almost passed it by because of the other one.  I'm glad I didn't!  This book is a great start for networking!  It takes the time to get a good foundation going, and then it builds on it.  The basics of networking are explained clearly and this book doesn't treat you as if you'd had years of experience in networking.  At the same time, it doesn't treat you like you've just discovered what electricity is either (like the other book).  Great book!	1998-07-23

If you have any kind of a working knowledge of Windows 95 or NT (I mean if you know what a Start button is), then this book won't interest you.  The CD is ok, but it doesn't have much to offer other than a couple of files you transfer or edit (text only).  All in all, a disappointment.	1998-07-21

I picked up this book when I was going through an incredibly difficult time in my life.  I thought that God was ignoring my prayers.  I looked at the way I was praying, what I was praying for, what I was saying, etc., but could find no answers to why I didn't see immediate answers to my prayer.  When I read this book, I saw things from a different light.  I was waiting for a &quot;yes or no&quot; answer from God, Rev. Anderson's book showed that sometimes God says &quot;Later&quot;, and sometimes He answers in ways that we don't even realize.  It's an incredible eye-opener for anyone needed support when your world is crashing around you.	1998-06-02
