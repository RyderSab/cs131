Books	2	36	38	N	Y	You Can't Judge a Book by its Cover	This book is the third and worst book in the Rich Dad trilogy, and if you believe the title, it will hand you to the secrets of investing.  It won't.<br /><br />This book opens up by taunting you with how the rich get to invest in investments that the majority of us cannot.  From there it drifts through wandering narratives, and vague advice on investing.  Surprisingly, the bulk of the book focuses on starting a business, with general information on how to take one public.<br /><br />In almost every repetitive page, the authors give generalized advice and tell you what you need to do, but not how.  Among the advice is to read more, learn more, and of course purchase more Rich Dad related products.  The authors take every opportunity to pitch the CashFlow board games.  Not surprisingly, they follow up with a chapter which focuses on these very board games.<br /><br />This book, like the others, is repetitive, and regurgitates much of the same information presented in the previous two Rich Dad books.  However, this time, there is more, and the wandering commentary is punctuated with notes from Susan.<br /><br />Moreover, much of the given advice is often conflicting.  The author touts that his Rich Dad told him not to work for a paycheck.  He states he was even homeless because of his dedication to this principle.  Later he says his Rich Dad told him to get a job with Xerox.  Rich Dad also said to keep your day job and start a business part time.  Much of the information contains conflicting nuggets like that.<br /><br />Simply stated, most of the book isn't even about investing in stocks or even real estate.  It is about vague financial advice for setting up your own company.<br /><br />And the special investments that the introduction and title allude to?  None are explained.<br /><br />If you want a wandering, verbose book with conflicting advice, purchase this book.  Otherwise, there are much better investment books on the market.	2004-11-29

In this book, Kiyosaki and Lechter have created and trademarked the \\"Cashflow Quadrant\\" shown on the cover of the book.  This is used repetitively as a teaching aid throughout the book, almost to the point of absurdity.  <br /> <br />This book is not especially well written, and be warned, it is repetitive.  But that repetition serves a purpose.  The authors repetitively hammer home the idea that to be rich you must be focused on the right side of the cashflow quadrant -- either as a business owner or investor.  <br /> <br />So how do you get there?  Few specific details are provided. The authors suggest you learn, read, develop your skills, start small, and just do it.  More specifically, the advice is to start your own successful business so it will help you to be a better investor.  The financial advice is always generalized.  <br /> <br />Still, the authors do make some points, some of which run counter to the standard investment advice handed out by \\"financial planners.\\" Most striking for the initiated is that a house is not necessarily an asset.  That investing can be low risk (but strategies are provided).  <br /> <br />I would only recommend this book to children or people who are interested in learning more about finance in very general terms, but only in addition to the other Rich Dad book.  Whoever reads this book will surely get the point-- that in order to be rich, hard work isn't enough.	2004-11-28

The pithy been-there-done-that tone and insider information is invaluable.  Every where I travel, I take along an LP guide.  My recent trip to the Philippines was no different, but I cannot recommend this travel guide to anyone.  The LP Philippines guide simply does not live up to the standard.   <br /> <br />The historical information is biased and slightly anti-American.  The authors go out of their way to make anti-American comments throughout the historical section, while saying little or nothing about the historical atrocities committed by other nations in the Philippines (Japanese death march anyone?).  The authors clearly feel that is their duty to inform the world that the United States is an empire building, bumbling, inept nation.  I found the condescending tone and political prejudices personally offensive.  <br /> <br />Secondly, I felt like the guide was written like a research report.  There is so much that isn't reflected in the guide. We hired a taxi or van (with the driver) for about 2,000 pesos and hit all the tourist areas for the entire a day, in Bohol, Cebu, and Davao (note: it is expected you feed the driver and he eats with you or at another table).  Depending on how you negotiate, the rate can go as high as 5,000 per day for an air conditioned van and driver.  This guide would have you waiting for taxi's or navigating Jeepney routes all day.  <br /> <br />In general, the travel information is adequate for the northern islands, with some notable exceptions.  If you plan on visiting Mindanao, find another travel guide entirely.  The authors are simply ignorant of the political situation in the Philippines, and the section on Mindanao is filled with inaccurate travel warnings.        <br /> <br />The information about Mindanao and Davao are almost non-existent.  If you are going to visit Mindanao, I would urge you to get another travel guide.  After spending time in and around Davao, I began to wonder if anyof the authors actually visited Davao, or did their exploration over the telephone. <br /> <br />The information in Manila is incomplete.  I was amazed at how little information was available on a modern city of that size.   <br /> <br />Surprisingly, the information about Cebu and Bohol, was more or less correct, but the price information was totally out of whack on panglao island on some of the resort hotels.  <br />	2004-11-19

But in this case, I felt compelled to because I have been absolutely thrilled with this phone.  When planning an upcoming trip overseas, I decided to upgrade from a Nokia 3595 to the V300.  Signal quality-wise, it is basically the same as the Nokia, but with a lot more features.<br /><br />The V300 is a clamshell tri-band gsm world phone (basically, it has most of the same features as the V600, except no Bluetooth, but much less expensive).  It operates on 900, 1800, and 1900 MHz.  I was also surprised that it came with a standard travel charger and adapters for foreign electrical outlets (no converter necessary).  You just snap the required adapter into the transformer and plug it into the foreign outlet. A nice touch for travelers!<br /><br />Also, it has a currency converter/calculator and can be used as an alarm clock.  Very useful!  This phone is a better travel alarm than some of the ones I have purchased!  It even has a snooze feature.  To turn the alarm off you have to open the phone and press a menu key.  Otherwise, it will snooze.<br /><br />The VGA camera was better than I expected.  Pictures can be emailed or sent to other MMS enabled phones.  The LCD screen is bright and can be viewed in both sunlight and indoors without problems.<br /><br />Sending and receiving SMS text messages is easy.  iTap takes some getting used to, but once you do, pounding out text messages is fast.  After sending and receiving text messages to friends overseas, I can understand why messaging is taking off.  It is so much less obtrusive than a phone call, especially when you are in meetings all day.<br /><br />The V300 supports AOL instant messenger (which I don't use).  With Yahoo Instant Messenger version 6, you can receive and send messages to and from Yahoo instant messenger, but it is entirely through sms messages.  It is unwieldy, but possible.<br /><br />Also, T-Mobile service is great.  They offered to unlock the phone, no questions asked, so you can use overseas SIM cards while you travel.  They are the most progressive of all the cell phone companies in the US in this respect.<br /><br />The ringtones are simply awesome, including mp3 ring tones.  When my phone rings at work, heads turn.<br /><br />The battery lasts about two or three days with me taking pictures, talking, or sms'ing (but I'm not a heavy cell phone user-- I only make one or two calls a day). One of the best things I like is that this phone will beep when the battery gets low.  If will give you plenty of warning. I even decided to run down the battery until it was dead.  It beeped for half a day before finally quitting. In contrast, the Nokias would only beep while you were talking on the phone, and die.<br /><br />The only bad thing (so far) is that the menus are not very well thought out.<br /><br />Most of the negative reviews are because of T-mobile tower signal issues.  Make sure you are in a coverage area before ordering.  In my unscientific comparison test, this phone was marginally better at picking up the signal than the Nokia 3595 inside buildings.offered to unlock the phone, no questions asked, so you can use overseas SIM cards while you travel.

As a result, when a project involves something I'm not intimately familiar with, I beg, borrow, or steal every book I can get my hands on.  I compulsively try to learn everything I can to become an expert, or at least be able to speak authoritatively. <br />This time around, a SCSI project landed on my desk.  So how did this book stack up against the others?  Here is my opinion.<br />This book is, hands down, the best written introductory book on SCSI available.  The authors take pains to clearly describe the evolution of SCSI, why you should use it, how to connect SCSI devices, and troubleshooting.  They even describe why a cable has to be terminated, in detail.  Administrators and technicians studying for the A+ exam will simply love this book.<br />Programmers, on the other hand, will come up wanting.  The actual protocol isn't discussed, only ASPI.  Examples are given in assembly (for DOS), and Delphi.  ASPI is discussed for DOS, Win 3.1, NT, and OS2.  <br />If you are looking for an introductory book that explains SCSI in basic, high-level terms, this is your book.  On the other hand, if you are seeking a book to help you jump start your application development, look elsewhere.	2004-02-29

I'm also not a fan of car wrecks either, but I do slow down and survey the damage (don't we all), and a car wreck would be apt metaphor for Chyna's (Joanie Laurer's) life.  So many events conspired to push her down, you would expect her to live a mediocre life, but no, somehow she rises above it and becomes a wrestling superstar.  That is what this book is about.<br />Although this book is poorly written, disjoined, double-spaced, and bordering on a literary version of attention deficit disorder, that just adds to picture.  The majority of the book deals with Joanie's difficult childhood, and is saturated by old grudges.  The final part of the book details her rise to fame and fortune.  <br />This is definitely a unique autobiography aimed at wrestling fans, but I found it entertaining nonetheless.  If you happen to find it in a resale shop, like I did, it might be worth a look.	2004-02-14

The been-there-done-that pithy writing style, combined with coverage of the off-the-beaten-path areas make my vacations (or business trips) memorable.  <br />However, this one stands apart from the other LP travel guides.  This guide is only 232 pages, about the size of a novella.  Missing are the cheap eats, some transportation information, and the typical insider's insights.<br />Reading the information, I got the feeling that this was less of an insider's guide, and more of a condensation of the visitors guides published by the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce. <br />As a result, I was somewhat disappointed by this one.  Still, it is on par with the other travel guides on Las Vegas, just not up to the LP standards.	2004-01-29

I always approach business books with a healthy amount of skepticism.  I've simply seen too many fairytale business fad books promising everything, only to fall short during implementation, long after the energetic sales pitch has faded. <br />So, with a lot of hesitation, I sat down a read the ULTIMATE COMPETITVE BUSINESS ADVANTAGE.  Fortunately for me, I did.  Once I got past the first few chapters I found it difficult to put it down.  <br />The ULTIMATE COMPETITIVE BUSINESS ADVANTAGE, by Donald Mitchell and Carol Coles is different from most books in the genre.  Mitchell and Carol researched some of the most successful businesses around over a ten-year period to figure out what they did right, and what made them exceptional companies while their competitors languished.  They also interviewed successful CEOs to see what set them apart.<br />Filled with countless anecdotes, the authors touch on key business ideas and present concrete examples.  Along the way there are nuggets of interesting information that you simply won't find anywhere else.  <br />Highly recommended for someone who is starting his or her own business or leading an existing one.  Five stars.	2003-11-24

Exam 70-300 (Pro-Certification)	Books	2	21	22	N	Y	Mediocre study aid	Microsoft has a hard earned reputation of producing verbose self-paced training books that only partially cover the exam objectives.  True to form, Microsoft has written a mediocre book that will not adequately prepare you for the new exam (70-300).<br />Unlike the previous book, which was pathetic and laughable, this one is merely mediocre.  Gone are the fictional character dialog, bad jokes, full page meeting agendas, and concerns about late employees.  This book covers, in depth, MSF.  Other exam objectives are basically ignored or given little coverage.   <br />Included is a CDROM with solutions documents in the form of excel spreadsheets, word documents (specifications), and visio charts.  Basically, you walk away with word and excel files you can adapt for your own use.  Unfortunately, the samples and documents are only a subset of the MSF templates you can download from Microsoft's website. <br />Still, the book tries to explain the MSF architecture approach, which makes use of UML, specifications, interviews, memos, and group hugs (MSF Team Model).  As a result, much of the coverage is how to produce project documents and artifacts.  <br />I would second the recommendations of the exam cram book.	2003-11-08

Written by Jim Rogers, a retired hedge-fund manager, it is a recounting of a world-wide adventure.  Along the way, Rogers punctuates his wandering narrative with economic observations and glib predictions about the future.   <br />Granted, Jim Rogers and his current wife Paige did something few will ever do-spend three years and drive through 116 countries, racking up over 152,000 miles doing it.  That is awe-inspiring. <br />However, while reading this book, I couldn't help but be reminded of the travelogues written at the turn of the last century, where rich families would travel the world jotting self-important journal entries about how superior they were to the local savages.  <br />Jim comes across as self-important and slightly arrogant.  Opinionated is putting it lightly.  But it is because he is what he is - a rich socialite traveling the world to indulge himself. <br />He blames European colonialism for most of the corruption and tyranny in Africa.  His solution?  Simply redraw the political maps around religious populations and end all aid to the countries.  <br />He states that anti-American bias around the world is because of... you guessed it.  United States government.  He criticizes Clinton, Bush, and Greenspan.  <br />The most interesting parts I thought was when Rogers retells about how he got conned into buying fake diamonds (glass in Africa), and also tracked down a broker that stole his money on a previous trip (South America).  He also was surprised about how many of his predictions from his previous trip were just simply wrong. <br />At least that offers some balance to the \\"I'm right and everyone else is wrong\\" tone that permeates the book.  <br />In spite of the negatives, I found it interesting nonetheless, to see the world filtered through Jim's eyes.	2003-10-22

Simply stated, this is the clearest and most well written book that I have read so far on this topic.  Although Orman sometimes diverts into the realm of psychology (understanding and conquering your fear of money), she effectively harnesses her years as a money manager and financial planner to give extremely good advice. <br />Salted with anecdotes, and seasoned with true stories and examples, this book breaks down the weighty issues of financial planning into easy to accomplish steps.  Orman, covers everything from dealing with fear of money, to getting out of credit card debt, to wills and trusts, and planning for retirement. <br />She also dispels some myths about wills, and gives some straightforward advice in preserving your estate if you should die.  She gives concrete examples of what has happened to people who believed that wills covered everything, before the lawyers and probate courts got finished.    <br />This book has the best explanation (in layman's terms) between the differences, pros and cons of 401k, Roth IRA, and Traditional IRAs.  <br />Although Susie often diverts into realm of psychobabble, she draws real life stories with impact.  <br />An enlightening, worthwhile read.<br />NOTE: Amazon was having server problems as I posted this review, that is why it is duplicated.

After I finished reading this book, I was able to do what I need to do, but didn't have a great idea of how the whole system worked.  <br />There are plenty of timing diagrams and lots of good information, but most of it useless for a software developer.  For example, the entire chapter of Hot-Plug PCI was well written, but it described what needed to be done to the various control lines-- something that would be implemented by the Hotplug PCI chipset controller.  As a result, it is nice to know, but ultimately, useless.  <br />Simply stated, if you are looking for a book to help write a device driver for a PCI-based device, this isn't it.   On the other hand, if you are software developer looking for a primer on PCI, I would still look elsewhere.	2003-06-07

I think the book is just so-so.  It does the job giving you a point in the right direction, but sometimes, only barely.    <br />I love NWN, and purchased this book to help slog through the different possible quests.  I think that the asking price was too much for a magazine-ish glossy book.<br />Aside from the price, there were other things to disappoint.   There were errors in the book (I'm guessing that the book was written before the game was finished).  Also, the layout and organization is horrible.  Columns of text are punctuated with screenshots and cartoon-ish.  The maps in the book are not great, either.    <br />On the other hand, the book does point you in the right direction, and I found myself flipping through it in order to save some time and rack up a few extra quests.  <br />A good portion of the book lists out spells, weapons, skills, and monsters.  These sections are easiest to read and most uniform, more so than the little book that comes with NWN.  <br />For those of us who don't get dressed up and beat each other with wooden swords on the weekends (or know the newer DND rules), this book is helpful, if you can get past the gaudy, glossy, cluttered pages.	2002-11-27

Hicks has written an enthusiastic (if not a little disorganized) book that actively promotes his company's products (International Wealth Success, Inc.).  Apparently, IWS is predominantly in the business of selling \\"information kits.\\"  <br />Under the chapter entitled resources, Tyler hawks books from his \\"Wealth Success Library.\\"  They range from 30 pages to over 219 pages, and [varie in price]  And while you are shopping in the \\"library,\\" don't forget to sign up for the ... \\"newsletter,\\" which Tyler brings up on several occasions.<br />Further, the types of businesses highlighted mirror those techniques that were presented in the get-rich-quick business courses that were relentlessly hawked on late night infomercials during the 90's, with one notable exception.  <br />None of the other get-rich-quick books out there would dare suggest becoming a child care professional (baby sitting) as a way to become rich beyond your wildest dreams.  This one does.  I'm serious.  Just read, \\"Chapter 8: Provide Quality Child Care and Prosper.\\"  <br />The only good thing about this book is that it throws some pretty  ludicrous ideas at you, so it can start the brain storming process. <br />If you are looking for a guide to reach financial nirvana, keep looking.

It is and it isn't.  <br />I came away disappointed after reading this patchwork collection of stories.<br />This book is divided into six thematic sections: 1) Look before You Leap, 2) Early Decisions, 3) The Money Chase, 4) Management Issues, 5) Helping Hand(s) and 6) Marketing. Each section has a collection of anecdotes to drive home a particular message, followed by &quot;tips&quot; that further reinforce the main theme.  Anecdotes cover the gamut from reinforcing the standard &quot;I wish I had more money&quot; to &quot;I wish I was more prepared&quot; or &quot;I wish I didn't prepare so much&quot;.  Unfortunately, I felt as if some of the &quot;advice&quot; conflicted with some other &quot;advice&quot; presented in a section.  <br />On the plus side, there are a few inspirational nuggets, and I personally enjoyed reading about one or two individuals who started from scratch to build large businesses.  For the most part the stories focus on common sense advice.  <br />If you are looking for a book to help shape your business plan or guide your actions, this book probably won't help you.  <br />If, on the other hand, you have never started a business or thought about it, you might find the book interesting.	2002-07-10

Rich joined the legendary 'Skunk Works' as a young engineer, worked on some of the most secretive military projects in recent history, and later ended up taking over management of Skunk Works.  As a result, perhaps no one else in the world has as much first hand knowledge of these projects, and no one else is better positioned to chronicle some of America's military crown jewels.<br />Rich (and Janos) have crafted a unique book that gives Ben Rich story, with interesting first hand accounts from pilots, air force personnel, and highly placed government officials.  Rich covers the struggles encountered while building various classified aircraft: the U2, SR-71 BlackBird, the stealth fighter, the stealth boat, among others.  He also lightly delves into the darker side of the defense industry: politics, waste, and bureaucracy.  <br />An amazing read, and highly recommended.	2002-05-11

Along the way, it presents a fascinating look at the forces that led to the creation of Linux, the controversies, the proponents, and the opponents.   For those who want to understand the unlikely hero who created a freely available open source operating system, this book is enlightening, inspiring, and informative.<br />My only criticisms about the book are due primarily to Dave Diamond's contributions, which thankfully, are minimal.  Dave pretty much interjects his own italicized dialog with Linus, in a car, in a sauna, which detracts from the otherwise amazing story, but probably highlights the making of the book.   <br />Luckily 90 percent of the book was written by Linus; Linus comes across as he is known to be-- direct, honest, and to the point.	2002-04-12

I have never been disappointed with an O'Reilly book.  This book continues the tradition of above par books and I can attest that hands down, this is the best book available on Samba.<br />Remarkably, the information inside is aging very well.  While it doesn't cover the most current version of Samba, this book is by far the most informative and helpful on the subject available.  <br />While the book is fortified with examples, screenshots, and an easy to read style, by far my favorite portion is on troubleshooting (complete with a &quot;fault tree&quot;).  It is just a way of systematically approaching connectivity problems in relation to the samba server.  <br />I mean, really, what exactly is &quot;System error 53?&quot;  This book won't tell you outright, but it will help narrow down the problem to solvable proportions.   <br />The included CDROM also includes a mirror to the official Samba FTP site, including sources, binaries, documentation, and utilities.<br />When I have Samba configuration problems, or questions pop up about Samba, this is the book I reach for.

The material is basically the same, but the presentation and tone are totally different.<br />The fact is that this type of diet works.  And this flies in the face of conventional nutritional thinking.  I found the epilogue, which pointed out that autopsies of mummified Egyptians showed that they too faced clogged arteries and obesity, in spite of the fact that their diets were totally &quot;healthy&quot; by current standards.<br />Unlike the Atkins book, this book tends to be more pragmatic in its approach, and more readable.	2002-01-26

Enter Traister, one of the few to write a book solely on this subject.  This book focuses on explaining pointers in a way to enlighten new C++ programmers.  <br />This book is basically a rehash of C pointers, substituting cout for printf statements.  It is a C-centric book rewritten to take up C++, which mirrors Traister's other works, &quot;Going from C to C++&quot; and &quot;C Pointers&quot;.  <br />You won't find anything advanced, like abstract virtual classes, how the virtual tables are composed, or other interesting topics.  In fact, when discussing how virtual members suddenly change the pointer offsets, he states &quot;[t]his is a bit of mystery... The answer to these questions must somehow be linked to the use of the virtual methods in the class.&quot;  Obviously, he doesn't understand how virtual tables are constructed. <br />Traister sticks to the basics, and covers them reasonably well.	2002-01-15

Foundation Classes	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Covers the basics, with some interesting tricks	Having reached a plateau in my understanding of MFC, I needed a resource to step me through the process of building and implementing owner-drawn controls, self-drawn controls, and implementing advanced user interfaces with MFC.  This book was one of the ones I reached for, hoping it would provide some insight on those subjects.<br />It didn't.  Nothing extreme or truly advanced here, it certainly isn't the &quot;complete guide.&quot; <br />This book only covers the basics, and glances over owner-drawn controls. Self-drawn controls are only mentioned indirectly.  Subclassing is explained in relation to edit controls (with an example).  Due to the lack of depth, you will read some sections of the book wanting more, and end up looking at the source code examples.  <br />The bulk of Bugg's book is focused on presenting the same information you can get from other books, albeit with a slightly better explanation and a little more depth (it explains the various options, and provides examples), in one singular volume.<br />I do like the layout.  A chapter is dedicated to each control or resource: buttons, edit controls, listboxes, checklist boxes, status bars, combo boxes, toolbars, and the new common controls are covered, and are reasonably well explained.  Also, the common dialogs are also presented.  If you want to refresh your memory on something, like the common file dialog, you just go to that chapter.  This means you can avoid having to thumb through several chapters like other MFC books.<br />Bugg also includes some neat tricks.  However, I would point out that the code on pages 324 - 325 is unnecessary to add a beveled separator to a dialog.  All you have to do is draw a picture box on your dialog with a width of 1, and check off the &quot;Sunken&quot; and &quot;Border&quot; properties in the resource editor.  No code is necessary.  <br />I would say this book would be a worthwhile supplement to the mega-huge-all-in-one MFC books on the market which touches one every subject without really teaching you anything in particular.  It would especially be useful for programmers in the beginner to intermediate range. It just isn't useful to me, aside from being a reference.	2002-01-08

It offers little or no &quot;how-to&quot; or useful information.<br />Renckly's book does provide very basic information, but offers very little that is compelling or informative.  In most cases, it simply rehashes common sense.  <br />The most useful portion of the book details what front line managers SHOULD NOT ask in a hiring interview.	2002-01-05

Most of my installations required installing my device drivers (data acquisition and motion controller drivers), my own software, and third-party applications (computer vision).  As a result, the standard documentation wasn't exactly overly helpful.<br />This was the best book on the market.  At the time, it was the ONLY book on the market.  Although it offered a nominal amount of help for me, it did give me a fuller understanding to InstallShield and really helped when I needed to build installers for more standard applications.  <br />Considering at the time this book was originally published, the only other avenue to get IS information was to attend a high dollar seminar, it was a great value.  <br />This book comes with a CDROM with InstallShield 5, DemoShield and some other demoware.  <br />I give it 3 stars, not because it isn't a great book, but because Microsoft redefined how installers should work with the operating system (driver signatures, system directory protection, etc.) and some of the information is now obsolete.	2001-12-29

Although the content predominantly revolves around documents and views, many other common questions are also answered.  <br />Personally, I love the format and the content.  I hate having to weed through several huge books to find an answer to a simple question.  I loaned out my previous copy, and it wasn't returned.  I ended up buying another copy.<br />While this book won't make you a guru, it just might save you an hour of frustration.  Since I migrate between operating systems, APIs, and SDKs, I never put in the time to earn the title of MFC Guru, so this book comes in handy, especially when it comes to refreshing my memory, without having to plow through the MFC code. <br />Unfortunately, this book is not all-inclusive, as many questions are left out.  The &quot;new&quot; controls are left out entirely.  However, even with the omissions, the book will give you a straight answer or point you in the right direction about 90% of the time.  <br />Highly recommended.	2001-12-29

I've read countless books on the subject that cover dozens of subjects, with little depth.  This book is on the opposite side of the spectrum, providing a much-needed resource, and covering the topics in depth, at the same time.<br />This book covers a niche in the MFC world, one which isn't well explained (or documented) in any of the other hundreds of books I've read. The bulk of this book covers: printing, system metrics, fonts, bitmaps, complex document/views, enhanced metafiles, and internet programming.  <br />In some places, it gets bogged down by explaining what every function or attribute does, but that is for the benefit of the reader.  It is obvious Broquard has been there, done that, often presenting several ways to do things, highlighting the best use for each case. <br />Highly recommended.	2001-12-29

I find them a refreshing change from the continual stream of beginner/introductory C/C++ books that cover the same information over and over again (&quot;hello world&quot;).  This book covers a lot of things that don't fall within the neat confines of the standard C++ primer, especially if you consider the Visual C++ genre. <br />This book covers a lot of ground, much of it is in the form of annotated source code: sorting, linked lists, b-trees, performing financial calculations, statistical applications, and implementing language interpreters in C++.<br />There are relatively few C++ classes in the source code.  The bulk of the code is straight out C coding, to which C++ purist may object.  <br />Although it bills itself as compiler independent, the chapters on Internet programming and fractal graphics are pretty much Visual C++ all the way.	2001-12-27

This is an introductory book on CGI, with examples written in both TCL and Perl.  It is a great idea for a book; unfortunately, this is a poor implementation of that idea.<br />Source code listings, tips, and notes are presented in way to make them almost unreadable (black text on a dark gray background).  Notes and tips are written in a font designed to mimic handwriting, but makes it even more unreadable.  I'm not talking distracting or unique, but unreadable.  On page 73, the gray background gets darker the further the text progresses down the page, until you have black on black.  A portion of that page is totally unreadable.  This continues throughout the book.  I am stunned that Prentice Hall didn't catch this.  The design of this book is horrible.<br />Mr. Ivler aims the book for people comfortable with TCL or Perl (and UNIX), yet spends three chapters introducing the HTML protocol, firewalls, and other topics.  The author's focus seems confused throughout the book and the author(s) loose sight of who the audience is frequently.  <br />More or less, the second half of the book ends up documenting their scripts.<br />I also found the copyright notice offensive (page 575)... that informs the readers that Ivler and Husain owned the code (fair enough), but also owned any modifications you make to the code (yeah, right).  <br />On the plus side, it does have code you can cut and paste into your own projects and demonstrates what you can do with CGI on a limited scale, albeit without a lot of depth.	2001-12-21
US	41906261	RDI1M95ZWLOJB	0345311485	12581581	On the Beach	Books	4	1	3	N	N	Classic Nuclear Dread	This 1950s novel tells a very simple story.  After a nuclear war has devastated the Northern Hemisphere (who knows how it started), the people of Australia have seven to eight months to live, while the radioactivity drifts into the Southern Hemisphere.   As the radiation slowly advances, they die, either by messy radiation poisoning, or by their own hands.  Somewhere in between, the characters try to cope with their own mortality.<br />Why does this book stand out?  Certainly not because the characters are believable, but because it broke new ground in the literary world.  Written some fifty years ago, during the Cold War, it paints a vivid and bleak picture of humanity's last days from an Australian perspective, where everyone dies.   It holds up the specter of what could happen. <br />Given that this book was written in a time when the Civil Defense was prompting civilians to build bomb shelters, &quot;duck and cover,&quot; and to resume a normal life after a nuclear event, this book seems groundbreaking in retrospect.	2001-12-18

I have successfully used DocBook/SGMLtools to produce documents of various types, but I wanted the additional flexibility that XML promises.  After all, isn't XML an extension of SGML?<br />With that simplistic goal in mind (generating boilerplate XML and doing simple transformations), I started scouring the Net in search of a good primer.  I ended up with this book to learn the basics. <br />This book is consciously aimed at readers who have experience and knowledge with HTML, and a passing familiarity with XML.  It bills itself as an example hands-on driven informational tutorial.  Unfortunately, it falls short, and in my opinion is a little myopic.<br />The first five chapters of this book lay a good foundation for understanding XML.  Unfortunately, it isn't until chapter five, that you are actually (almost indirectly) walked through the process of REALLY using XML.  Finding an XSL processor was tedious, requiring several Net searches.  <br />This book effectively presents the basics, and keeps going (far beyond what I wanted to know).  It even steps you though building a simple e-commerce solution (with Java and XML).<br />Compared to the other XML resources I looked at, this one is the best at providing a good introduction.  After reading this book you won't be a guru, but you should have a concrete understanding of the basics.	2001-12-18

I second that opinion, especially if you are looking to hit the higher percentiles.   <br />This isn't a dry academic text, but an easy to read text that covers the basics with a minimum of handholding.

He had the perfect opportunity to write a compelling book about flamboyant dealmakers and their deals.  Unfortunately, in 800+ pages, Wasserstein has done a remarkable job of revealing little or nothing about his personal experiences.<br />This book covers the basics of M&amp;A, various deals throughout history, and interjects profiles of some of the notable dealmakers like Diller, Redstone, Icahn, Pickens, and more.<br />The author also tackles the issue of how these mergers and acquisitions affect the little guy, trying to explain away anti-merger rhetoric.  Unfortunately, most of his arguments can be summarized as, &quot;it isn't that simple.&quot;  Not very compelling.<br /><br />This gargantuan book is informative, but most of it is dry and stilted.  If you are looking for hidden information or colorful anecdotes about the stunning amount of money changing hands, this book will not give you what you want.	2001-12-09

Considering the source, this should be the best book on the market, but it isn't by a long shot.<br />This book is, like the other Microsoft texts, an exercise-driven text.  Each chapter contains one or more labs to be used to reinforce the material presented in the chapter.  If you remember lab books from chemistry class - which contain some descriptive information followed by a step by step procedure, then you get the idea.<br />This book is neither an exam cram styled review, or an in depth exploratory text.  This book is more a collection of lab-based tutorials. <br />If you are a skilled Visual C++ programmer, and are looking for a review, you will find your eyes glazing over while you read what you already know.  The layout will also act like a comprehension speed bump. <br />On the other hand, if you are a neophyte, you are stepped through the process of building applications and applying the information.

Emblazoned across the top of the cover is the phrase, &quot;Open This Book as a Novice and Finish It as a Pro.&quot;  If only that were true. <br />This book focuses on the new features available under Visual C++ 6.0, and provides a great resource for learning those topics.  Unfortunately, it seems to be schizophrenic in the topics it tackles.  This is not an introductory book designed to teach you Visual C++ &quot;from the Ground Up&quot; as the title implies.<br />The first part of the book is a verbose introduction to Visual C++. The second part focuses on ADO and ODBC database topics.  The next one-third of the book focuses on Internet related topics, from designing a web page, through basic JavaScript, and finishes on IIS (Microsoft Internet Information Server). Later, Mueller delves into security issues.  Next, Mueller explores creating help files, and HTML help files (this part of the book is worth its weight in gold).  The last part focuses on packaging your application for distribution.  <br />While I can't deny that this book contains a lot of great information (once you get past the verbose introduction), it doesn't do what it sets out be-- an all-inclusive tutorial on Visual C++.<br />I would go so far as to say that the title is intentionally misleading.  Also, note that there is relatively little source code presented within the text.<br />What it does not cover: basic controls, dialogs, windows messaging, DDX, owner drawn controls, document-view framework, or any basic MFC classes.	2001-12-03

It isn't.  I was sorely disappointed in the depth (and length) of the text. <br />However, the author achieves what he sets out to do -- create a readable statistics book without any mathematical formulas.<br />Rowntree's text does provide a good overview in very general and broad terms on statistical topics in layman's terms.  It is consciously targeted towards non-mathematicians, and provides a great resource for understanding basic statistical topics.  This book is for people who must casually digest and interpret statistics, and not for those of us who need to produce them.<br />This thin paperback is a relatively quick read.  There are no exercises, just descriptive examples woven into the text, punctuated by a few questions.  <br />Reading this won't make you pass a statistics final, nor will it make you an expert.

It is a review that reflects the topics taught in introductory accounting classes.  As a result, topics are presented in a concise manner, then the text moves on to the next topic.  <br />Although I love the terse, no-nonsense style of the Business Review series, I was somewhat disappointed in this book.  Double-entry accounting is summarized, not explained.  It does, however, cover the basics with real world examples and exercises.  <br />Purchase orders are only mentioned in passing.  Sales invoices, sales receipts, service invoices, and are not mentioned at all.  The chapter on receivables and payables focuses on methods of writing off bad debts, and extending credit. <br />If you are looking for a review for your accounting class, this might be it.  If you are looking for a one-stop resource to help run your business, you might finish this book and find yourself reaching for other books to fill the gaps.	2001-11-20

A more appropriate title should have been, &quot;building a PIM.&quot;  While this book examines a variety of subjects: sorting, B-Trees, indexing, disk I/O, it strays into &quot;synonyms&quot; (interesting feature) and specific requirements of the example program.  <br />On the plus side, the author understands B-Trees and labors to explain them.  This is the first author that actually mentions pages used within the b-tree, and this b-tree is presented in a real example, not just an example in memory.  <br />The example program is a personal informational manager (PIM) called ROBIN.  And the author introduces topics while building the program, in an attempt to give the reader a real-life application for the code written from the exercises.  This PIM application is implemented in a command-line environment.  <br />The author focuses on ANSI standard C++, and the code can be used on a variety of platforms.  This book provides a lot of usable source and examples, but unfortunately few programmers will need to implement their own indexed flat files.<br />Interesting read.  The author also lightly touches on design concepts, and offers some advice.<br />What is NOT covered: GUI, STL, advanced polymorphism, MFC collection classes, or Microsoft specific technology.	2001-11-17

In this book, O'Reilly confronts several topics that the mainstream media will not, although sometimes in a slightly self-promotional, preachy tone.  He has created an entertaining, easy to read book on a variety of controversial topics in a unique writing style.  Each chapter begins with a snippet of dialog from his show, followed by his commentary. <br />O'Reilly comes across as he does on his show - he gives his opinion in a no-nonsense way that doesn't demonize those he doesn't agree with (which is unique in most politically charged books).  <br />O'Reilly effortlessly splices interviews with notable celebrities into his running personal commentary.  He doesn't attempt to sway or convince the reader, only presents a slightly more biased version we see on his show - with more O'Reilly and less back talk.  <br />The only complaint I had was I wished the book was longer.	2001-11-10

The &quot;comprehensive&quot; review isn't exactly comprehensive.  However, the 3 sample exams do contain explanations on why the correct answer is correct and can help you focus your study efforts.<br />For research-oriented learners, you can read the questions, then look up the answer or search for it.  For those who want to read the material first then see how well they retained it, you will be disappointed. This isn't a teach-and-test type of book.  Many questions are on topics that are not presented in the &quot;comprehensive review.&quot;  It gives you the bare minimum, followed by a representation of the marketing CLEP exam (as it was in past years).  You are left to fill in the blanks.<br />I give it three stars, primarily because it does help to study for the exam, and compared with the other resources available (textbooks, CliffsNotes-type books, etc.), it is better than blindly guessing at the test objectives.  <br />As someone who has prepared for numerous certification exams, I wish there were some resources available for CLEP and DANTES examinations, like the ExamCram and ExamPrep variety.  Until then, this is the best book in the genre for preparing for the marketing exam.  Sad, but true.	2001-10-25

They are terse, condensed books that are usually well worth reading.  They make excellent books to prepare for most Microsoft exams.  <br />In general, I love the exam cram/prep books.  They present the material in a no-nonsense, mater of fact way that covers the necessary topics with a minimum of extraneous information.  This book, like the others reinforces the topics with review questions at the end of the chapters.<br />Unfortunately, the 70-100 exam isn't like any other exam.  It is a test divided into several &quot;testlets&quot;.  While this book will prepare you well for the background/architecture questions that appear in two of the &quot;testlets,&quot; it won't do much to prepare for the case-study-drag-and-drop testlets and scenario-based testlets. <br />This is a great study resource, but it is inadequate for the entire exam.  As a result, I would recommend this book, download the transcender demo, and get your hands on a resource that focuses on ERD (entity relationship diagrams) and database fundamentals.  The architecture exam is heavily database oriented.	2001-10-24

The first one was, of course, the MCSD certification (I am a software engineer with over 8 years of professional development with Microsoft products).  As a result, I have purchased almost every certification book in existence towards this goal.  This was one of preparation books that I purchased.<br />Using this book (and several other study resources), I failed the 70-100, but just barely (by one question).  The architecture exam is one of the most unique exams you will ever take, and the information in the book doesn't match up well with the content of the exam itself.  Although it does provide some good background on the MSF philosophy, it simply will not entirely prepare you for the exam.  This book is aimed at teaching MSF and not reviewing for the exam .<br />This book is huge, and it seems that the bulk of the book is taken up by dialog.  Yes, dialog.  <br />The authors succeed in a creating a unique mechanism to present the information (they call it scenario-based case studies).  The author presents an imaginary company, introduces several characters, and then follows the process of designing requirements through to implementation.  Along the way the MSF and other topics are covered, but in many parts of this book it reads like a poorly written fictional novel.  While I have to give the author extra points for creativity in trying to breath life into a dry and dull subject, I found that this book is a poor resource for preparing for the 70-100 in more general terms.<br />This book will give you a high level understanding of the Microsoft Solutions Framework and give you an idea on how to implement it in your work. Unfortunately, relatively few people will have the autonomy and authority to ever implement a project with a scope like the fictional projects described in this book. <br />On the plus side, there is a lot of useful and excellent material hiding in this book.  <br />Regardless of which book(s) you do purchase, I would recommend downloading the sample exams from the Microsoft website.	2001-10-23

This guide did not disappoint me.  When I booked my flight to New Zealand, I did as I always did - a round trip ticket, a reservation for one night at a hotel (to get over the jet lag), and a desire to see the country.  For the first two weeks I relied on the LP guide exclusively, and referred to it periodically whether I was on the North Island or the South Island.<br />I had the added benefit of a local friend to make suggestions, as well as the guidebook.  Some destinations (which are well worth a visit) are not included in the book, but it didn't stop me from shark diving, whale watching, hiking (tramping as the locals call it), and otherwise running around the country.<br />This guide gives a fundamental, non-commercial impression on what, where, and how to get there.  It also offers some historical/cultural information, and a lot of information about towns, attractions, restaurants, hotels (of various price ranges), and a few rough maps.<br />As an added bonus, when I got back, the book became a memento of the trip.  My bookcase contains LP travel guides from the countries I have visited, and when nostalgia strikes, I have been known to pull it down.  <br />I highly recommend this book for anyone who is about to travel to New Zealand for the first time, or anyone planning a trip.	2001-10-21

I highly recommend this guide book and used it extensively, while travelling in England and Scotland.  <br />When I first got off the plane and ended up at the airport, I made the mistake of making a hotel reservation through the Thomas Cook booth at the train station.  That was a mistake.  The next day, I pulled out my LP guide, and found a hotel down the street that was half the price, and it was cleaner, and nicer to boot.  From that moment onwards, I was hooked on LP guides.<br />Since I was travelling solo, and had a rail pass, I pretty much decided where I wanted to go when I woke up each morning.  I would find a hotel when it started to get dark.  When that would happen, I would pull out this guide, and find a place to stay.  <br />Recommended.	2001-10-21

I always rely on them heavily when I travel.  However, I was disappointed in this one.  It was great for planning the trip, and it lives up to the LP standard, but barely. <br />This book has some inaccuracies, but given the changes in Panama I'm sure it is to be expected.  I tried to call up several of the local guides that were listed in this book, but the phone numbers were out of order or they had moved on to bigger and better things.  <br />I ended up hitting the highlights of Panama and leaving in three days for Costa Rica, instead of the week I originally planned.   <br />Still, this book is a great source for information about the history, culture, restaurants, hotels, etc.  However, my advice would be to purchase a supplemental guide book or two.	2001-10-21

This travel guide is one of the ones I took with me, and I highly recommend it.  <br />This guide proved to be invaluable, and saved me a lot of headaches and money.  Traveling solo, I rarely make reservations or plans until I actually get there.  This is what I did when I got to Costa Rica.  <br />Thanks to this LP guide I can report the following highlights:  $7 per night hotel room in San Jose, watching a live volcano (Arenal), spending time in the hot springs at the base of a live volcano, visiting a coffee plantation, hiking through Cloud Forest, and seeing several breathtaking waterfalls. Travelling through Nicaragua to Tortugero to watch the endangered turtles lay eggs was definitely a worthwhile adventure.<br />A few words of advice: If you are going to visit the rain forest, bring a poncho.  It rains in the rain forest.  A lot, especially during the rainy season. Perhaps that is why they call it a rain forest.  Secondly, visit the local tourist offices in San Jose.  I went in looking for some free maps, and got a lot of good advice.  It never hurts to have some extra advice about where to go to supplement the guide.<br />A little dense, it becomes hard to visualize places when planning a trip, but the real value is when you are the ground and moving.  Highly recommended.	2001-10-21

As I identify myself as a libertarian, I agree with Rush more often than not, and consider myself a mostly conservative.  <br />However, that being said, Frankin's book is entertaining enough for me to recommended, once you get past the rabid attack on Rush.  So long as you take it for what it is, political satire, most of it can be entertaining.  I chuckled more often than not, even though Frankin can be pompous and very, very, very obnoxious at times.  Mostly he comes across as funny.<br />Be warned that if you are a conservative, you might find yourself gritting your teeth and wondering what village is missing its idiot (Frankin).  If you are a liberal, I'm sure you'll find yourself giggling like a schoolgirl caught in a tickle attack.	2001-10-20

Considering that there is a lot of overlap on those two exams, it is natural to tackle them in the same study guide.  If you make it through this book, you will be knowledgeable, but will probably not translate to on the job success.  <br />Like all MCSD exam books, this is not a &quot;how-to&quot; or a tutorial.  It is a well written and verbose study guide (which could have communicated the information in half the space).  In some areas it presents too much information and I felt it became too cluttered with screen shots.   In many other areas, it lacks depth.  Likewise, if you are looking for a book to teach you Visual Basic programming, this book is obviously not it.  On the other hand, if you are just looking to pass the exam and don't mind a little extra easy reading, this is your book.<br />I do like the format.  The chapters are usually focused and small.  Chapter objectives are presented, then the material, then case studies, and then review questions (and answers) to reinforce the material.  It makes it easy break the monotonous study routine in manageable pieces (like a chapter a night).  <br />Although this book lacks depth in many areas, it is one of the better study guides that I have purchased on the subject.	2001-10-20

This is not an &quot;idiot's guide to UNIX,&quot; nor is it a reprint of man pages.  It falls somewhere in between, and seems to be aimed at technical professionals who find themselves in a variety of operating systems at a moments notice such as Digital Unix (formerly OSF/1), Linux, Solaris, and AIX.  You name it, I've been there.<br />This book won't hold your hand and teach you what a file or directory is.  It is not a tutorial.  It is assumed that you know the basics.  I have referred to this book on numerous occasions when I had to write CGI scripts, or assigned to quick and dirty projects involving some flavor of UNIX, or porting applications to UNIX from Windows/Win-32.  <br />So, if you are like me, and don't want to spend a few hours plowing through a UNIX man pages just to remember the syntax of gzip, tar, or locating a command you used before and don't really remember what it was, this book is for you.	2001-10-19

Simply stated, this book is the best fiction book I have ever read.  This book is actually the four early Bachman books rolled into one tremendous read.  This isn't the typical King formula of characters caught up in a supernatural landscape, but believable characters in plausible situations.  <br />I have read hundreds of fiction books.

I just wish the second half of the book was as good as the first half.  Unfortunately, it wasn't. What started out as a truly great book, and ended as a mediocre one. <br />The first half of the book is suspenseful, riveting, and foretelling in a world proliferated by weapons of mass destruction.  As the characters face and weather the viral destruction of the US population, it is the story of the survivors trying to rebuild, and hopefully, build a better world.<br />At that point, I get the feeling that King had written the beginning to one of the best books ever created, then paused and said, &quot;now what?  How do I end the story?&quot;  I get the feeling he found the ending by simply continuing to write and letting the ending come to him as it would. <br />As the end neared, I found myself continuing to plow through the book towards the end, not because I was deeply interested, but because I wanted some closure.  Kind of like a really bad movie, you keep watching thinking, it has to get better.	2001-10-05

Given McMoneagle's affiliation with the STARGATE project (mentioned numerous times in the book), and various research efforts of the U.S. government, my gullibility got the better of me.   <br />McMoneagle's book is a very interesting read, but not really informative in a how-to sense.  This book is doesn't even mention any statistics on the effectiveness of any experiments, just a wordy anecdote here or there.  Later, I found out why -- it wasn't until I plowed through the book that I learned that the CIA's retroactive review of the STARGATE program pointed out that the government psychics were only accurate about 15 percent of the time.  <br />McMoneagle writes authoritatively on the subject, and he seems to have a dedicated following (just read the reviews here). He discusses protocols, methods, and ethics, without really giving away anything substantial, but leaves a lot unstated.  If you are a cynic, you will remain so; if you are a believer, you will believe more.  He even mentions peripherally: remote viewing in healing, dowsing, channeling, tarot cards, crystal gazing. <br />McMoneagle even includes two research papers (Appendix B, and C), with statistical formulas and technical graphs.  To the uneducated, it would appear as a tacit and scientific endorsement of the validity of remote viewing.  Considering the multi-million dollar investment, I expected a more compelling look at the topic. <br />I couldn't help but be chagrined with several decades or research a multi-million dollar investment in researching paranormal phenomena, and seeing child-like drawings produced during &quot;training&quot;.  <br />If you are a cynic or just open-minded, this book will not change your mind.  Save your money.	2001-10-04

It is a collection of sample exams with a verbose introduction.  It duplicates much of information available at the collegeboard website.  The bulk of the book is in the form of sample tests, one for each of the 34 subject examinations.  The information provided in this book is an exact duplicate of the subject study guides (which can be purchased for $6 and downloaded).  So, if you intend on purchasing four or more of the subject study guides, you save money by purchasing this book. <br />The CDROM &quot;cd sampler&quot; can be downloaded from the collegeboard website for free.  More importantly, it does not contain any sample questions.  It is basically a demo that walks through the computer exam.  For anyone with any level of comfort with a computer, it can be used as a drink coaster.	2001-10-04
US	41906261	R3UERQDEI7NT70	0072296860	245133077	Marketing: Principles & Perspectives	Books	3	2	2	N	N	easy to read but disappointing	I picked up this book as a preparation for the CLEP marketing exam.  While it is easy to read, the layout is cluttered and distracting.  The authors give a rah-rah treatment to e-commerce, presenting multiple .com case studies throughout the book (each chapter begins with an internet site and description).  <br />It is clear that the authors were infatuated with the so-called &quot;new economy,&quot; and the book suffers a lot as a result.  Using it as a primer is tiring, as you have to separate the essentials of marketing from the e-commerce cheerleading.<br />The publisher's website does have quizzes to test on the material, which I like, but overall, I was still somewhat disappointed.	2001-09-26
US	41906261	RM9ZLH14FHEFQ	0072296860	245133077	Marketing: Principles & Perspectives	Books	3	0	0	N	N	Easy to read, but a little disappointing	I purchased this book as a primer on Marketing, as a preparatory resource for the CLEP Principles of Marketing exam (3 semester hours).  The book effectively presents the basic terms and ideas in an airy, easy to read manner.   Also, the book's website contains quizzes that help reinforce the information, which is greatly appreciated.<br />However, I was somewhat disenchanted with the content which reaches for a &quot;futuristic&quot; flavor and misses something in the process.  In my opinion, the book concentrates too heavily on .com companies (some of which are now bankrupt and defunct) and gives an overall rah-rah treatment towards e-commerce.  Anecdotes abound and are used as filler in the main text, instead of informational sidebars.  Every chapter is introduced with another website URL emblazoned across the top of the page in a putrid yellow color.   <br />Thankfully, the authors did include a paragraph or two dissuading the reader from using SPAM (unsolicited email marketing), but it was a footnote in an otherwise verbose volume.  I was somewhat offended that from the context of those paragraphs, and an anecdote about one company's 12% response rate (versus 1% for direct mail) which is misleading and would probably leave marketing students thinking that spam was effective.  <br />For what I purchased the book for, it accomplishes the goals, albeit in a verbose manner.	2001-09-24
