Like most teenagers, I read this novel in Grade 10 as part of an English class.  I noted then it wasn't a bad book for a 'classic'.  I have since read this book twice more, most recently in June 2005.  Each time I read this book, I learn more from it and pick up things I missed previous times or perhaps I didn't miss them I'm just older and have learned to understand so many more things. <br /> <br />This novel is narrated by Scout and takes place over three summers in Maycomb county.  Scout, her older brother Jem and their summer time friend Dill have typical summer vacation for children of the south during the Depression.  They make up plays, they have a treehouse, there is a scarey neighbourhood house.  Scout starts the first line of the novel saying she remembers the summer that her brother Jem broke his arm.  From that line forward we learn about the events that lead to this and most importantly the summer that their father, Atticus represented a black man, Tom Robinson against the state and a white but trashy family, the Ewells. <br /> <br />If you have't picked up this book since highschool - I recommend you give it an adult read.	2005-06-26

'The Mermaid Chair' however was a different subject matter but like 'Bees' was beautifully written.   <br /> <br />In the 'Mermaid Chair', the author writes about how a couple can drift apart over the years of raising a child and what happens to life with the nest is empty.  Ms. Monk explored the feminine soul and desires and helped Jessie come to terms with the relationships in her life.  The focus was not only on her relationship with her husband but the relationships Jessie had growing up with her Mother and the loss of her Father.  <br /> <br />Jessie had to come to terms with all the events of her past so that she could finally lead a healthy present and future. <br />	2005-06-20

I tend to read books by female authors in which the main character is female.  Neither of these elements were in this book.  First off, the book is written by a male and the two main characters are two young Afghan boys. <br /> <br />I was drawn into the book by the opening line in which Amir states that his life changed on a winter night in 1975 when he was 12.  Amir and Hassen were raised together like brothers however Amir was the priviledged child and Hassen was his servant.  When out in public this relationship was apparent, Hassen was his servant boy however by themselves they were the best of friends.  Then that winter night in 1975 came and the title of the book made sense.  I won't tell you what happened you will have to read the book to learn that.  From this point forward the book tells of Amir's life following the winter of '75.  I found it fascinating to learn about Afganistan, migrating to America, Afgan during the Taliban rule and all the culture that was in this book. <br /> <br />I was not disappointed and I know you won't be either.	2005-04-05

I had MJF posters on my walls from all the teen magazines always hoping I would meet some one as cool as Marty McFly and live happily ever after.<br />Reading Lucky Man showed me the other side of Mr. Fox.  It exposed to me to all the ups and downs he went through when he was diagnosed with young onset Parkinson's disease.  It took extreme courage to write this memoir and made publicly known how hard it is to sometimes accept what happens in life.  MJF has helped bring awareness to Parkinson's disease it is just too bad that it took some famous to turn people's attention to this disease.	2003-01-22

Two girls Maude Coleman and Lavinia Waterhouse meet at the cemetery as their families have side-by-side graves. The two girls become fast friends mixing with the likes of the cemetery boy, Simon. The story takes you through the friendship of the two girls from 1901 to 1910.

She has written the book so that the chapters are from the point of view of each character. It is a unique style of writing as you get to see the events and how they transpire from the different view of each character.	2003-01-22
