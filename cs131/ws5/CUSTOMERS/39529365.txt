The Soul Grows in Darkness is the third of Loren Pedersen's<br /><br />books I've read. His first two were important contributions to<br /><br />understanding men's psychology:  Dark Hearts, the Unconscious<br /><br />Forces that Shape Men's Lives, and Sixteen Men: Understanding<br /><br />Masculine Personality Types.  I loved them both.  Reading the<br /><br />Soul Grows in Darkness helps me comprehend why the other two<br /><br />books were so accurate, insightful, and useful...Loren \\"walks<br /><br />his talk\\"...he learned this stuff from life experience, and deep self-reflection.<br /><br />  The Soul Grows In Darkness could easily be made into a movie.  It has drama, excitement, and an engaging, believeable protagonist.<br /><br />  Its a definite page turner.  Since I have ADD its often hard for me to stay focused while reading. Despite the hundreds of<br /><br />partially read books in my house, this book held my attention<br /><br />fully; I couldn't put it down. I read The Soul Grows in Darkness overnight.<br /><br />  The Soul Grows in Darkness works on many levels. Even on the most superficial level, the story impacts because you see how our hero, Loren, starts from Chicago's version of \\"Hell's Kitchen\\"..a rat-infested walk-up, with a drunken step-father, cold-fish mother, and hoodlum older brothers to becoming a Jungian analyst, gifted stained-glass artist, caring father,<br /><br />author, and activist.  Pedersen was no \\"goody-two-shoes\\" either; it was \\"touch and go\\" for quite some time.<br /><br />  The book takes you through the struggles he faced as he tried to find himself in an environment where \\"dark forces\\" lurk on every corner, including the recessess of his own brilliant<br /><br />mind.  I compare its emotional and spiritual impact to one of<br /><br />my favorite books, Man's Search for Meaning by Victor Frankl.<br /><br />Frankl was also a therapist who overcame horrendous obstacles: in<br /><br />Frankl's case, the holocaust.  Both Pedersen and Frankl find meaning in suffering, and emerge from extreme and painful circumstances, not with bitterness, but more loving than anyone<br /><br />might imagine they could ever be! Their journeys are similarly<br /><br />heroic and profound.<br /><br />  There are many touching scenes. For example, the description<br /><br />of his encounter with Johnny Mathis is pure magic.  Many times<br /><br />I laughed out loud, and several times I cried.  Like me, you will be positively haunted, and shifted, and moved when you read this remarkable and uplifting story.<br /><br />  Similar to Forest Gump, Pedersen seemed to have a knack for being in a front row seat for many fascinating aspects of American life.  His experience spans being a gang leader, to a demonstrator at the 1968 Chicago Democratic Convention, being asked to spy for the FBI while living in Berkeley during the<br /><br />Viet Nam war, seeing the Dalai Lama, and a few autopsies, to<br /><br />name a few!<br /><br />  This coming-of-age, (and developing-of-wholeness) book<br /><br />also carries the reader through Loren's many spiritual trials<br /><br />including brutal encounters with religious dogmatists, and<br /><br />tragic, heartbreaking losses that would have put weaker souls<br /><br />in straight-jackets.  Pedersen's journey out of despair inspires<br /><br />and teaches.  The reader is carried along the twists and turns, easily identifying with Loren's struggle and brought to a dazzling new shore where it's finally safe to love oneself.<br /><br />  Perdesen's writing style is clean, clear, and humble.  It rings true with every word. He has taken the best and worst<br /><br />experiences of his fascinating life and connected the dots in a meaningful manner, producing a map that will give even the most desperate person hope.<br /><br />  This book is a natural classic.  It will takes its place<br /><br />beside The Catcher in the Rye and the Prophet.<br /><br />  Samuel Paterson said, \\"Books, likefriends, should be few and well-chosen.\\"  The Soul Grows in Darkness doubly applies.  Read this book...and you will have found a new friend. Quite<br /><br />possibly you will also find a lifeline to move your own soul out of darkness!will also find a lifeline to move your own soul out of darkness!   <br />	2005-02-26

I showed this book to<br /><br />the locals and they had not heard of it. (This was in the mid<br /><br />l980's). They were beautiful, simple people and not widely read.<br /><br />Ixtlan is more a metaphor than a reality I realized.<br /><br />  I have read several of the Carlos Castenadas books and<br /><br />the details of each blur in my mind...but the essence of what<br /><br />they taught live with me. Its about being in the flow,<br /><br />about balancing energy, about trusting nature, and so much more!<br /><br />  I read them before I knew a whit about metaphysics.  Now<br /><br />that I am a 25 year veteran and teach this stuff, I realize<br /><br />that Carlos gave me a wonderful spiritual foundation in these<br /><br />books.  One of my favorite lines of his is: \\"Follow the Path<br /><br />With Heart\\".  Just read it, keep your mind open, and be willing<br /><br />to receive change. It will all be positive, I assure you!	2005-01-17

I teach metaphysics and this is one of my all time favorite<br /><br />books in the world. I particularly would recommend it for a young<br /><br />teen who is confused about spirit/religion or for anyone<br /><br />leaning towards atheism (which I did for awhile), or anyone<br /><br />struggling with spiritual and religious concepts in general.....its a book that rises above all the dogma and gives you Wonder, Straight Up, full of delight!<br /><br />  Its a joyful story in and of itself. It also teaches in a<br /><br />lovely way.  I can't count how many times I've read or it<br /><br />how many people I've given it.	2005-01-17

I've been working with Goldsmith material for a few years,<br /><br />more deeply these last 12 months or so. I certainly haven't<br /><br />read everything.  I find Goldsmith thought provoking, soul<br /><br />stretching, an intimate friend on my spiritual path.  This<br /><br />book is by far the best I've studied.<br /><br />  I read a chapter each morning and meditate with it.  I take<br /><br />notes.  I simply love it.<br /><br />  I've been studying spirit and metaphysics for 25 years and<br /><br />thought I had a pretty good handle on things.  But have been<br /><br />challenged and provoked again and again in this amazing book.<br /><br />If you're reading this review, you're ready for this book.<br /><br />I have written the word WOW numerous times in the margins.<br /><br />It blows my mind.  Thanks again, Joel Goldsmith!	2005-01-17

This worked for me so well because I came out<br /><br />of a home where these kinds of things were not taught.  It<br /><br />was a primer for \\"gracious living\\".  I'm not saying I learned<br /><br />to do everything in the book...but it set a tone, a pattern<br /><br />that has helped me along.<br /><br />  Perhaps the most important thing was to help set a homey<br /><br />feel in my life. I'd been single for more than 18 years and<br /><br />didn't know how to properly nurture myself, much less another.<br /><br />Using some of these tips, I began the process. Was it just<br /><br />a miracle that I met my husband-to-be within 2 months? I don't<br /><br />know..but we're starting our 10th year together.  I see<br /><br />Alexandra as part of that home healing path for me.  Not everyone<br /><br />needs this book, but for those who do, I think she does<br /><br />a great job.	2005-01-17

For that reason I see them as \\"one book\\".<br /><br />However, the marriage of the two \\"picked the lock\\" of a stubborn<br /><br />problem in my life.  They helped me move from a lifelong pattern<br /><br />of destructive relationships with men and women, to a much<br /><br />more satisfying way of living.  I did the writing exercises<br /><br />and wept copiously.  This book worked me hard, but it helped<br /><br />me more than any others.

I am<br />a prophetess as MM was portrayed in this book.  I have a broad<br />religious background/upbringing...so I was extremely curious<br />to see how Margaret George would approach this subject.  I read<br />her background when only a few pages into the story to see if<br />it would annoy me...and I was heartened at her personal background and have not been disappointed at all in the way<br />she tells the tale.<br />  My favorite parts of the story are the subtle, useful, and<br />sometimes profound narrative comments she or her characters make...the &quot;between the lines meat&quot; that give great satisfaction<br />to my soul.  I have been both entertained, educated, and<br />spiritually fed with this book.<br />  An example that particularly touched me: (THere is a discussion between Jesus and the disciples and Mary M. about<br />her abilities as a prophetess)....p. 423<br />  &quot;Prophets have visions,&quot; said Jesus as long last.  &quot;True visions are the mark of a true prophet.  Peter, have you had any<br />visions?&quot;<br />  &quot;Yes&quot;, said Jesus's mother, brushing her wet hair back off her cheek. &quot;Even I have had visions. When I was younger...visions about you, my son.  Faint ones, ones I never told you about, but they were visions. Does that make me a prophet , or someone holy?&quot;<br />  Jesus nodded. &quot;I think you are holy,&quot; he said. &quot;But I do believe that Mary has been granted some special spiritual gifts,<br />not because of her own worthiness or wisdom, but because that was God's own mysterious choice.  He chooses someone, often someone<br />who seems very ordinary.&quot;<br />  skip down a couple of paragraphs, then:<br />  Jesus took what seemed forever before he answered. &quot;In the coming Kingdom, we will all be God's treasures, as it was in Eden.  But Mary has had more of what shapes a soul in her lifetime than you.  What shapes a soul?  Suffering.  It is a sad<br />fact that without suffering our spiritual eyes are often never opened.  And Mary has had the demons, has been vilified, has lost her husband...both in his affections and in life.  She has had her daughter taken away from her. Such things change a person, just as cut and seasoned wood is different from green.  And so it is not just the visions.&quot;<br />  (This account rings true with my own personal history.<br />I trust George's rendition of her story due to the perception<br />she uses in this particular encounter which I personally<br />understand very well.)<br />  I generally only read a novel once every five years or so.<br />Thank God, this is the one I chose this time. The other was a<br />great read too:  Autobiography of a Geisha.<br />  Thank you Margaret George!ering our spiritual eyes are often never opened.

If you're ready for it, you<br />will love it. The only other Goldsmith book I like better than<br />this is Parenthesis in Eternity.

This book came to me so highly recommended by people I love<br />and trust that I was intrigued from the start.  Within a few<br />sentences, I wanted to know what would happen to this kid<br />who was run over by a mail truck.  The story unfolds with<br />enough twists and turns to keep you surprised continuously,<br />and yet you'll laugh and cry along with the character/hero<br />Edgar every step of the way.<br />  What I think the book REALLY is, however, is an incredibly<br />accurate account of institutionalized child abuse, especially<br />of minorities, the poor, and sick.  The indifference of the<br />caretakers (not caregivers!), the horrendously shallow people<br />in charge, the do-gooders, the desperate, the drunks, they're<br />all here.  It makes you squirm, it makes you feel, but most<br />of all it gets right in your face and possibly makes you grow<br />and become more wonderful gently human!  I love Edgar Mint!	2003-08-09

How to deal with overnight slumber<br />parties, good table manners, how to behave in class, who pays on<br />dates, how to avoid arguments with family members, what to do if<br />you embarrass yourself, how to open up conversations, etc.  I wish I'd had this book when I was 14! It would have made such a difference.  It answers the questions I was too afraid to ask.<br />A wonderful gift from any caring adult to any young adult.  Simply arranged, nice drawings, not too cumbersome or preachy.<br />Many adults could benefit from this too!	2003-02-03

Although I am not a psychologist, I am a keen student of<br />human behavior.  I work more in the metaphysical realm...have<br />studied astrology, numerology and and other systems that<br />give \\"types\\" of people.  I find Dr. Pedersen's book amazingly<br />accurate in the details.<br />  I was tested by him while undergoing therapy more than 30 years ago and learned I was an intuitive extrovert, feeling, perceiving type.  (I am a professional clairvoyant now, but<br />was not working in the career when tested).<br />  I decided to use this book to find out what type my husband is and what I could learn about him.  He turns out to be a classic ISTJ ....Richard in the book (the accountant).  He studied accounting, is a computer programmer, his childhood and<br />teen life seem to be lifted right out of the pages of this book, and this book is extremely helpful for me to learn more adaptive and useful communication systems to relate to him better.  We<br />had a little tiff last night because he felt I was too much in<br />the \\"future\\" all the time...and reading this book helps me see<br />why he says that, and helps me be more patient with out differing styles.<br />  Anyone who is fascinated with \\"what makes people tick\\" will<br />enjoy using this book...professional or layman alike.  It rings<br />true!<br />  I know the Myer's-Briggs test is not a new thing, but<br />this book brings the personality types to life.  It makes the<br />system accessible.<br />  Thats a very good thing!  This book may be ultimately<br />as helpful to understanding between people as John Gray's<br />Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus has been.<br />  Congratulations on another fine book, Dr. Pedersen!<br />  (Please feel free to see my review of Dark Hearts, also<br />on Amazon.com)	2003-02-01

Due to its guidance, I joined the<br />12-step programs adult children of alcoholics and codependents<br />anonymous (among others).<br />  Twenty years later, I am happily married and successfully<br />dealing with my codependency patterns.  I now set boundaries,<br />now have self-esteem, and am able to discern whats \\"my stuff\\"<br />and \\"your baggage\\" and don't take yours on as \\"my problem\\" any<br />more. Thank you very much Janet Woititz! By the way, I have<br />recommended this book to more than 500 people in my counseling<br />work over the years.  No one ever reported back that it was a<br />waste of time.	2003-02-01

The pictures make<br />me laugh, and the special way that the story weaves its spell<br />helps one see how our pride often gets us into terrible<br />fixes and embarrassment. It would help anyone come down of<br />his &quot;high horse&quot; a bit.  Wonderful, simply wonderful!	2003-02-01

Years of therapy have helped me<BR>heal and get back to me and my feelings.  The last place to <BR>heal has been my lower torso area.  Discovering belly dancing<BR>is profoundly moving (no pun intended!) and this book helps<BR>put the whole thing into historical and personal perspective.<BR>I especially like the part about how the women dance for each<BR>other and bond in feminine ritual and understanding...even<BR>when children in the middle east.  <BR>    I think this book is valuable on many levels.	2003-02-01

Because the book has no words at all...it can be used internationally, with someone of any ability to speak your language.  It reminds me of my amazing ability of being able to enjoy the circus when I lived in Mexico.  Though I had not learned the language yet, I still enjoyed the show....the visuals carried the story.<br />This book does the same.  The story told is about identification<br />and belonging.  A mother bunny is looking at a child's empty bed and is holding a story book.  She wishes to tell the story to her own baby (you realize this by the end of the book)..  Through wonderfully charming pictures, a little child holds up sequentially a kitty, a frog, a puppy, a lamb, a mouse, a pig, and an owl. With each progressive picture, you see the mother bunny more and more dismayed that none of these creatures is HER BABY!  She holds her hand up to her brow with eyes closed in frustration.  ( A good parent will be able to embellish this book by pointing out the various differences in the animals, helping the child identify what makes an animal unique).<br />Then near the end of the story, the child brings her a precious<br />baby bunny...HER BABY, and she becomes ecstatic!  She settles the<br />baby buuny into bed, commences to read the story, and the child sits by listening too.  When the baby bunny goes to sleep, the child and Mother Bunny quietly leave the room with a smile.  It reminds me a bit of the Runaway Bunny...an incredibly special children's book also, that all mothers should read to their children.  This is for younger children obviously, but it retains an ageless charm.	2003-02-01

I have been to workshops with John Van Auken and he has<br />a tremendous capacity and knowledge of ancient wisdom...that<br />seems to supercede what one can learn from distilling normal<br />history books, on site investigations, and even reading the<br />Edgar Cayce material...its as if he &quot;lived there, lived then,<br />and has a remarkable capacity to remember it all and reveal it<br />clearly and effectively&quot;....<br />  This book is another splendid example of John's crystal<br />clear and profoundly deep capacity to share his knowledge<br />in a manner that both layman and passionate scholar  can grasp.	2002-09-25

I had the privilege of being a client of Dr. Pedersen many<br />years ago.  (More than 30!).<br />  When I read this book about 10 years ago, one exercise in<br />particular was profoundly useful.  Although the book is written<br />mostly for men, I just adapted the exercise to my own needs.<br />  I did a dialogue with my &quot;inner male&quot; ....and discovered that<br />he was only about 12 years old and afraid of women!  (No wonder<br />I was having problems finding a mature relationship!).  I<br />followed the instructions in the exercise and worked for several<br />days and was amazed to watch a transformation in this &quot;guy&quot; and<br />his maturing etc.  I became more comfortable with myself, and<br />my life started to open up too.  I even designed and led a workshop for women that used this exercise as its core element.<br />All of the women loved it.  I have recently celebrated my<br />sixth anniversary with a spendid, loving and mature partner.  I<br />feel this book was very helpful in teaching me a system that<br />bridged a major hole in my own psyche.  Dr. Pedersen is a brilliant, caring and intuitive therapist and the book contains<br />equal doses of his wisdom.  I urge you to give it a try!	2002-09-08
