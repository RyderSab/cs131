Now,as an adult,I feel the same.In fact,I found the story even more wonderful. With her simple yet eloquent writing,Betty Smith takes you on an emotional journey that holds you from the first page to the last. Francie(her alter ego) is a very real,sensitive young heroine,and her family,even with all it's problems is a lovable one.(we could all use an Aunt Sissy!) Her father,though he has a severe drinking problem(and this was long before AA) is a sympathic charactor who truly loves his family,especially his daughter who adores him in spite of his illness,however she's not blind to it,which shows how intelligent she is. There is alot of humor too,which provides a balance thats just right. A beautiful story about growing up and life itself.	2005-07-28

Ms. Beckerman is about my mom's age,also from New York and so it brought back a lot of pleasant memories for her. I also enjoyed the simple charming illustrations of styles from the 40's to the 90's and her memoirs about each item. Best of all,it does make you realize how important a part clothes play in our lives,especially for women. Gingy's(the main character)life isn't always easy and at times,tragic(divorce,death) but she has a wonderfully wry philosophical outlook and,of course,great style..!	2005-05-09

The daughter of an abusive father and indiffrent mother,her brilliant mind enabled her to write the classic treatise \\"Vindication Of The Rights Of Women\\" while only in her 20's. She also journeyed to France and witnessed The French Revolution in all it's g(l)ory,had several passionate love affairs,one which produced a child though the father had no intention of leaving his wife and marrying her, making her a single working mother long before it was either fashionable or accepted. She married William Godwin ,(the father of the future Mary Shelley) and tragically died from complications of her  childbirth at 38. Although Ms. Wollenstonecraft's life was short,it was well-lived and makes for fascinating reading that the author(Diane Jacobs) vividly brings to life with both immediacy and wit. An empowering book for woman as well as an engrossing bio for both sexes..	2005-04-21

His language,though beautiful ,is so sublime its hard to believe that one man (who only went to school until age 14) could write have it without some \\"assistance\\". This book,which dosen't proclaim to be \\"The\\" definative biography of his life and works,is in spite of it's serious title,a rather cheeky,earthy, and at times very bawdy,but above all,acessible look at the Bard. Through a fictional?  narrator charactor named nicknamed Pickleherring ,who performed many of the female parts as one of his original players,we are taken on a journey through WS's life in a unprentious,humorous fashion. Despite<br /> advanced age and the distractions of the young prostitute next door(he live above a brothel) He still weaves has a highly engrossing \\"I Was There\\" tome with fascinating details and antedotes about the author that make \\"The Bard\\" both human and accessible. Above all, This book was fun and made Shakespeare and the times he lived in, both immediate and belivable. For anyone who would like to read more about Shakepeare,but in a non-textbook format,give this book a try..!	2005-02-13

I got this book out the library and enjoyed it so much that I purchased it online. Sister Wendy is a great art critic,especially for people who might be intimated by it. She is to the point,uses unfussy language and truly seems to love painting. I did question some of her choices,but art is a subjective medium,.and overall,I agreed with many of them, Although why she didn't include the \\"Mona Lisa\\"  or Dega's dancer's is beyond me. Finally,she is very-open minded (considering her vocation) so a lot her choices were pleasantly surprising. Enjoy the beautifully reproduced paintings and pick your own favorite works..	2005-01-14

Instead,it's an engrossing,can't-put-it-down dealing with two sisters, Anne Boleyn and her lesser known sister,, Mary,whom King Henry the VIII had a relationship with (as well as fathering two of her children )before Lady Anne caught his eye. The book shows(in vivid detail) how Anne manages to get the notorious womanizer undivided attention,first by stealing him away from her more placid sister,then trying to get him to make her Queen,in spite of the Church,people's negative view of their marriage,her own highly outspoken nature,in a time where women had to know their place(or else).And, most importantly,not giving him a son,which leads to her tragic downfall. This book takes you on a journey,makes you think and best of all,is truly entertaining..	2004-12-07

The main charactor of Gentian,(whom I liked,although she(and her group,the ironically named Giant Ants\\", were a bit precocious for my taste at times) are an unusual group of young girls who'd rather discuss Shakespeare than boys & fashion. A highly mysterious (and handsome)boy,Dominic ,shows up in the neighborhood in time to shake up Gentian's placid existance. His amibiguity and Time Machine project kept me reading.Unfortunately,the project, like the book,never seems to take off and a strange spell(or curse?) that they father placed on his daughters so they would'nt ever want to run off with any handsome,intriguing young men  sends the story off in an unsatifying direction(which,hopefully. I certainly he lifts by the time they're of age! ) Overall,this book was less about fantasy and more like an updated Little Women(whom the author refers quite a bit) Not would you'd expect,but not terrible either,just a bit of let-down.	2004-11-15

I realize it was historical fiction and was glad that the author carefully explained it at the end of the book. Still,however,her \\"Madame\\" does emerge as a flesh & blood woman. Not always likeable,but very engaging and very much her own person. The descriptions of 19th century Paris are also vivid and realisitic. And the painter himself,J.S Seargant is depicted as eccentric but exacting in what he wants from his subject Finally, all that fuss over a painting which by todays standards is diginifed and evena bit chaste shows how far we've come since that time!

The story concerns Christopher, a teenage boy in England who is (a la \\"Rainman\\") a Math Savant,yet,like many Autistics,cannot stand to be hugged,has trouble recognizing other's peoples(or his own) emotions,and adheres to a strict routine to cope with a world that is not as precise as the math problems he loves solving. The mystery he tries to solve(and due to his strong sense of logic,does) is just a jumping-off point to a story full of imagination and gentle humor. I think this book does a great service for Autistics as well,it shows that they are people with feelings and personal issues too. An original,thoughtful book.	2004-02-28

The terrible news from overseas being dictated urgently by a popular radio personality only makes her more unbalanced and eager to assume this new life. Though a bit pedantic at times,this is an intriguing,and overall unsettling,tale,with flashes of dry humor. A unique book that will make you think.	2004-01-16

Overall,it's a great story. The author convincingly shows how Charlie goes from being mentally disabled to brillant within a few short months of being operated for an experiment about increasing IQ's that first was tried out on a mouse. People are a bit more complicated than lab mice,however,and therein lies the story. Charlie experiences a whole range of emotions and thoughts that make his life much more complex and confusing and at times makes you wish that he was never used as a &quot;guinea pig&quot;. In the end, however,you end up rooting for him and hope he stays where he is mentally. How he gets money for an apartment,etc is glossed over but that's a minor flaw in an otherwise,fascinating,involving story.	2003-11-23

The French are neither portrayed as horribly rude and unwashed( a played-out,suspect stereotype to begin with) Nor are Amercians portrayed as simple and uncultivated,(at least the ones in this book weren't.) What I like less was the rather icky affair Isabel has with a 70 year old man and the ending which didn't match the tone of book and seemed to belong to a different story. The &quot;travel-guide&quot; aspect and observations of this book are great though and it's what I reccommend most. Read and enjoy the &quot;trip&quot;...	2003-09-28

Like many people who pick up this book,I too also thought it was going to be exclusively about the \\"Spelling Bee Experience\\" which,in itself is an interesting enough subject. Then the book goes off in to some very out there tangents,especially dealing with the mother of the spelling whiz : a very disurbed Kleptomanic.  The father, meanwhile, is wonderfully kind(if slightly out of touch) and supportive mentor to his daughter Eliza. Finally, the older brother is a more realistic character:  unhappy teenager who is trying to find himself by trying out another religion besides Judisiam. The end of the book was not accessible at all,with the girl going off into an other-wordly experience merely by chanting from a book about the Kabballah (btw,there is ALOT of chanting in this story). If you want to read something that is not really at all what you expected it to be,I suggest this book.	2003-09-13

It centers around Bee Bearhorn,a very passe pop singer from the 80's and her tragic,sudden sucicide which her younger half-sister,Ana, (whom barely knew her) finds herself ,reluctantly at first,then with increasing fascination, as she unravels what exactly happened to the sister she pictured  as &quot;having it all&quot;.  She sorts out the mystery with the help of some of Bee's friends (who each have their own interesting  back-story as well )  especially her former limo driver, Flint,whom Ana finds herself very attracted to. The end results are both funny and sad and the ending,though wrapped up a bit too neatly, is satisfying.Once again, London makes a great backdrop too. A chick-lit mystery(of sorts)  that makes for an engrossing,fast read.	2003-08-29

It's a great historical chronicile that at times,outdoes the story itself,which at 800 pages,is a bit long,but overall very engrossing.Also,considering it's length,it's surprisingly easy to follow as the author wisely chose not to over-populate the book with too many charactors,and,in addition to it's heroine,I really cared about them and their various fates. Now,the downside:  I know the author is trying to make this a &quot;unVictorian&quot; Victorian story but he does get rather repetitive with his descriptions of bodily functions,and the ending? Well,it's a bold move(sequel anyone?) In conclusion,a very good(and at times) great read.	2003-03-11

In fact,the first part was almost a bit too graphic in its violent depictions of class war and revenge in Ireland and then New York. Also,The author seemed a bit unsure when writing about the 18th century so the people(as a result)are a bit too modern in their speech and somewhat stereotypical as well. But when the book shifts to the present day,the writing became more believable,the charactors much more multi-dimensional,in short a different,much improved story emerged.

Steve Martin's &quot;novella&quot; about an otherwise annoymous shopgirl at Neiman-Marcus in Beverly Hills is a very well-written,unexpectingly touching story. The romance that she has with an older gentleman is realistic and the observations about  the &quot;rich &amp; vapid&quot; people that populate that particuliar area of real estate are well-drawn as well. The ending might catch you by surprize,but it makes the story more interesting and actually makes sense in a true-to-life kind of way.

Miss Jean Brodie seems like a teacher sent from heaven: She's witty,well traveled,and clearly interested in her young female students,so much that she chooses several to become part of her\\"set\\" which is considered a great honor-but is it? The book slowly lets you see Miss Brodie's manipulative side as she tries to eeriely control her \\"girls\\" lives and forever changes them as a result. A bit episodic at times and the play(as well as movie) had a more powerful ending. Still,it's an interesting charactor study which will make you think well after you've finished it.	2002-09-14

I did enjoy it,I thought Hugh Grant and all the others were very well-cast and so I kept picturing when reading the book. This book is touching without being sappy and funny in a knowing way,Like the line about being able to date a typical pre-teens bedroom within a 24 hour time-frame(too true!) It even made a dead duck seem funny without being in bad taste. It also had a real feeling of London city life. All in all,an entertaining book about a man's(finally) growing up helped in part by his unlikely friendship with an eccentric 12 year old boy.	2002-08-20

I got this book out of the library because the grandfather on the cover looks so much like my dad. As for the book,it's simple,charming stories and illustrations are perfect for the \\"pre-Harry Potter\\" set. I really liked the relationship between the little girl and her slightly eccentric,but very lovable grandpa. With her parents being divorced,she develops a very close bond with him,which is the main message of the stories. A good book to read aloud(the songs the grandpa sings are very cute) Enjoyable with a positive message for both young and old.	2002-08-16

I have to say,once again the book is the winner. It dosen't have that silly &quot;kidnapping&quot; of Sidda by the other Ya-Ya's and is so full of detail that you can feel the 98% humidity and taste the Cajun food so mouth-wateringly depicted in the story. Most of all,it nice to read about a group of friends who geniuniely care for each-other and don't go around back-stabbing or cheating with the other's husband,etc. It'll make  you wish had ones as loyal and appreciate the ones that are. It gets a bit slow in spots,but overall a very charming book.	2002-07-22

Having liked &quot;Girl With The Pearl Earring&quot; so much I was looking forward to Ms. Chevalier's latest book. My opinion; and yes, I was comparing it to the other book,clearly the better of two. I found the charactors in this book a bit flat and rather sterotypical as well as the monologue format tiresome after awhile. And the ending;I sensed some symbolism at work,but of what? Is it that hanging around graveyards is bad luck? Kitty was the most interesting charactor and I wished the entire book could've been focused on her;she's the only charactor that truly changed her life,while everyone else stayed essentially the same from the first chapter. I do think Chevaliers' one of the better writers out there so I will read her next book and hope it's better than this one.	2002-06-12

This book turns the tragedy on it's ear by telling it in reverse,which was not clear to me at first. When it did,it was quite a chilling,ironic story.

Ok,I actually wanted MORE detail as the subject was so interesting. Having been a fan of Vermeer's work,even before reading this book.I felt the&quot;story&quot; behind this painting,although fictionalized,seemed very plausible. Griet is both naive and very intelligent at the same time for she recognises Vermeer's genius. The day-to-day life of the household was also very authentic-feeling; Ms. Chevailer  captures the drudgery of being a maid in a realistic,matter-of-fact way. You can see why this girl was willing to pierce her own ears so she could be in the painting,if only to escape her dreary,monotonous life for a brief while. A fine portrait about a famous portrait.	2002-05-28

Quite the opposite,in fact,I now find myself browsing the Comic racks at bookstores. In other words,this book made me appreciate this uniquely American art form. Oh,and the two main protaginists are interesting as well. Sam Clay(Man),the fast-talking scrawny guy from Brooklyn and his opposite, Cousin Joe Kavalier,a handsome,talented artist who arrives from Prague,just escaping the Nazis and coping with the hopelessness he feels by collaberating with Sam on a \\"superhero\\" that can symbolically \\"rescue\\" both family and other Jews ,and, most importantly, help him finance his plan of bringing his brother over. Things don't turn out the way they're supposed to,and a series of real-life cliff-hangers intrudes on both Sam & Joe's lives,some for the better,some tragic. This is a long book,but worth the effort. And,if you're from NY and lived there circa 1939-54,the beautifully described landmarks and atmosphere will make you very nostalgic. My dad is now reading it,and says the descriptions are very accurate. The second half does drag a bit,but,again,stay with it- you'll be glad you did...	2002-05-25

Being of this supposed group,I really didn't want to read a book claiming(or being claimed as) the book that defined myself and other people in one broad stroke(or so I thought) So I skipped that one,but, after reading &quot;Miss Wyoming&quot; I just might get around to it. Coupland really has a handle on all things pop culture and he's a good writer as well. The story seemed convuluted at times,but then I realized that was the tone of the book,which is full of bizarre coincidences and situations. And,as odd as these people seem,you really do end up(for the most part) caring about them. Btw,Ryan &amp; Vanessa,two supporting charactors in the book,were interesting enough for a story of their own.Overall, A better book than I expected.	2002-05-02

It has some interesting characters and issues,but overall,it's not the first book from them I'd recommend. It does have some very relevant paasages that are quite feminist considering when it was written. I couldn't really sympathize with the main charactor because she had everything handed to her. Therefore(to me anyway), She lacked the empathy of a Jane Eyre or Lucy Snowe,whom really had to overcome life's obstacles,not being either rich or beautiful. Also,the ending seemed like a Jane Austen- ripoff, the overall tone of the book didn't seem to fit in with it.Read the others first before this one,she really was a great writer,this is just not the best example of her work.	2001-12-14

I mean,in my opinion she could write about the phone book and keep me engrossed. You may not agree with me,I know,I just wanted to state that before I review this book,which while not her best work of the ones I've read so far, still resonates. The three woman are so well-drawn that you feel like you are snooping in on some very good friends. All quite flawed, but still the kind of friends I wish I had more of. Also, There are,unfortunately,&quot;Zenias&quot; in this world,although most don't operate on such a high-level of manipulation as she does. The stark reality of these woman's lives is a vivid,though at times,a bit unbelievable parallel to this woman who seems to exist only for her own selfish needs. It's a scary,sometimes funny and often sad book that will keep you wondering what will happen next.	2001-10-27

It's interesting to see how she is either directly or indirectly responsible for everyone's mis-fortune (Talk about passive-agressive!) However, The constant stream of charactors was hard to follow at times. Actually,a fun read overall and I learned alot about French politcs of that time.

I have a love/not quite hate-more like an ambivlent(sic) feeling about both this book and Hotel Paradise. First of all,I love the Emma character. What a great kid,she's smart,funny,and VERY imaginative. Like pretending she's on vacation in Florida along with her mom,the mom's business partner and annoying teen-age daughter. Great stuff and handled in a non-cutesy way. Also,how the sheriff &amp; etc in town treat her wtih respect and don't talk down to her. Ms.Grimes ability to get into a 12 year old's mind is terrific. Ok,the bad part,the main mystery she's trying to solve just sits there like a lump of cold mashed potatos(yes,the food descriptions are yummmy as well)I'm referring to The Queen Family one. I wished she could've just focused on uncovering Mary-Evelyn's drowning instead. I got confused with the two overlapping mysteries. Ok,I'm not a big mystery reader so maybe it's just me. Read it for it's young heroine and the sharp writing if mysteries aren't your &quot;thing&quot; either.	2001-08-23

Her mis-guided life as a result of coveting &quot;fine clothes&quot; is vividly described and while I wanted to truly dislike Mary,I could'nt. She's such a contrary(sorry about the pun) character,and maybe we all have a little Mary in us at times. Other well-drawn characters add to the story although the ending was a bit too pat.

Don't let the cover of this book fool you;this is not a funny book,maybe in a tragio-comedic way. It is really about how the so-called &quot;American Dream&quot; eludes several female generations of a Russian-Jewish emmigrant family. Its not a typical &quot;rags to riches&quot;story like most books dealing with Jewish immigrants. In a way,I like how the writer avoided that obvious trap.

However, I really liked the Jeremy Walker charactor and how he undergoes a transfomation as a result of his relationship with this perfect young thing that just lands in his lap one summer day. It's an uneven,but at times very intriguing look at an oft-written about theme. And I actually did want them to end up together.

And why do they always have to be so beautiful? Why not an average-attractive girl for a change? Not hideous,but maybe an awkward 15 year old,which is what most of them are anyway.

He points out he's no saint,just an average guy trying to do the best he can with a tragic situation. Parts of the book rambled on a lot,and the ending was,well,uh,sort of an &quot;anti-ending&quot; to say the least. But parts of the book were quite touching without being all gooey and overly-sentimential and some of the stuff about the magazine was laugh out loud funny.(two words; Adam Rich) and his observations of the different people he meets in SF as well. However,the pre-amble at the beginning oof the book was rather tiresome and went on for waay too long. For that reason,I'm giving this book 3 stars,instead of 4.

US	52936085	R2QYR1JY5KVNB2	0871137534	441036137	The Dress Lodger	Books	3	1	1	N	N	A Fascinating But Confusing Story.	This book has a great premise and interesting,well-drawn main charactors although the secondary ones were a bit too sketchy. Also is the so-called &quot;Student Of Life&quot; charactor supposed to be Charles Dickens? (Since the author is so obviously influenced by the author,just wondering..) The main problem with this book is that it's over-written. This is an extremely interesting plot to begin with,but the author is obviously so in love with the English language that it bogs the story down. Also the spotty British spellings were distracting,but that could be the fault of the editor. It is very different,and a good historical account of 19th century industrial England.So if you are'nt too squeamish I do recommmend it. P.S. I have no critcism of the book's cover art,it's great and perfectly captures the mood of the story.	2000-11-17

I love fashion history,so I checked this book out of the library and I wasn't disappointed;in fact I was pleasantly surprised! This book has facts that are really interesting and obscure and it  covers each fashion era very well. Although it's billed for younger readers, Anyone whose interested in clothes should enjoy it..!	2000-10-03

First of all,don't read this book and expect it to be like the movie;it's both different and in a lot of ways,better. In other ways,I liked the movie better. But generally speaking this was one of the best books I've ever read;Irving writes so you feel these people are a part of your life and you are glad for it;the abortion issue is expertly handled;it's neither pounded into the ground or soft-pedaled and he lets you draw your own conclusions about it. This book is a modern classic, and,in my opinion, should be required reading along-side Dr.Larch's beloved Dickens.	2000-10-03

I got his book out of the library last year thinking it would be an amusing little romp. Boy was I wrong,it was all that and more! This is a book that if I see it mentioned anywhere, my eyes tear up(corny but true..) My mom enjoyed it as well,she usually prefers celebrity tell-alls but she really got into this story.I hope to pass on my copy to any female offspring I might have someday,(and nieces as well..!) Males too,so they can understand how our minds work!(lol) Enjoy..!	2000-08-24

I read this book expecting something more lighthearted,perhaps,But  jeeze,this was depressing! The author obviously is down on the theatrical  world(I read on the jacket cover she was a young actress before becoming a  writer)  Maybe she had some really negative experiences in the theatah,but  the book was so down and pretty mean-spirited as well. Yes,there are a lot  of jerks in show biz,but, I've through personal experience met a lot of  great people as well,however everyone in Ms. Bainbridge's book was rather  unlikable. No wonder the poor girl went nuts!  A little too cynical for my  tastes,but it had it's moments...	2000-08-24

I normally do not set out to read \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" picks but I was intrigued to read a book about Chile because my sister-in-law is of Chilean descent. I enjoyed this book more than any other in quite a while,it has believable characters that are very well-written,especially Tao!I enjoyed the descriptions of of both 19th century Chile and the Gold Rush,better than the dry,boring textbooks of grade school. It does get a bit contrived at times,However I really recommend this book too,(with thanks to Oprah..!)	2000-08-16

Florence struck me as a desperate,shallow,woman-child with poop for brains  and the morals of an unspayed feline (and not very likeable on top of all  that!) She was so dopey I wanted to yell at the book&quot;what were you  thinking!&quot; and if she was so desperate to get married a the &quot;ripe  old age&quot; of 32,why not the lawyer? At least he had integrity,and if  she was smarter she would have checked into his background,to see if he did  come from money;alot of public defenders do,it's a way of easing their  conscious,as any reader of John Grisham can tell you...I liked her  &quot;Cross Dressing&quot; book alot more than this one,this woman was just  pathetic..	2000-05-22

I really enjoyed This Side Of Paradise&quot; so I thought I'd have a go with this one.  It is very well written,of course, and it does create a mood,but it failed to truly move me. I guess it was the narrator's detached  air. I realize that literature is a subjective art form,so I'm not going to  say&quot;Don't read this book!&quot; because it might really  &quot;speak&quot; to the next person who reads it. So get the book,read it  and draw your own conclusions..!	2000-05-05

I Loved the first book,It really made me feel like I was THERE;Finney's  descriptions were vivid and entertaining and I learned a lot of things  about day- to-day life 1880's NY.  The sequel was just OK, the parrallel  events theory was intriguing,but,as a whole the story seemed liked a lot of  ideas that never followed through. The ending itself was a BIG  disappointment,after setting up this potentially great plotline, (Stopping  WW1) the author just cheats us by not even following through with that  storyline.  I did like some of the descriptions of 1912 New York, but they  just were'nt as wonderfully descriptive the first novel.  Also,the fact  that he sort of cheated on his wife bugged me,because he seemed to have no  real guilt about it,until the last few chapters of the book. In  Conclusion,amusing,but no classic.	1999-11-21

I had heard other girls requesting it in the  library and so I bought at a schoolbook fair. I really liked the beginning but then had trouble whenmy  11 year old A.D.D-afflicted brain could'nthandle it's rather long  length.Curiously, I never got beyond aboutthat part of book,then one night,  having nothing to read I decided togive it another go and I loved it!Then  in my 20's,(and A.D.D better under control)I got the humor, understood all  thesister's hopes and ambitions betterthen ever,especially Jo's and Amy's.  It really was a &quot;progressive&quot;book for it's time in that these  girls had ambitions beyond just  getting married, is about following your  bliss,doingwhat makes you happy and living your life to the fullest. That's  what makes it so timeless.	1999-07-04

As a Jewish kid,it was unusual to find books about other Jewish kids. Thats why I loved these books so much;I especially liked how one of the girls was always getting into scrapes. And it was romantic when the eldest sister found a really great boyfriend. I think of these books as a kind of &quot;Jewish Little Women&quot; (another favorite of mine) but you don't have to be Jewish to enjoy them!	1998-01-15
