And for 99% of the book, I was not disappointed.  The cast of characters is still compelling, the murders mysterious and gruesome, and the campy, smarter-than-Sherlock exploits of Pendergast are as fun as ever.  But then comes the end.  Since some readers may not have read the book yet, I won't give away the details.  Suffice it to say, the authors seem to lose confidence in their own ability to keep attracting readers for their next book.  So they build the need to come back for more into the plot itself, which is pretty crappy.  After slogging through Brimstone (an even longer book than this) and Dance of Death, I didn't need to be manipulated into buying another book of theirs.  But after the end of this book, I actually won't bother getting another one.  They've lost me. <br /> <br />It's really too bad, because I was poised to give this book at least 4 stars, and maybe 5, if the ending had delivered even modestly on the action of the bulk of the book.  But alas, they went for the Incredible Hulk TV show ending, and the melancholy piano music was echoing in my head as this clunky ending crashed down.  I felt cheated.	2005-10-13

The characters are fairly well drawn, but the overall plot is just kind of humdrum.  There is a twist at the end, but not quite enough to make up for the ordinariness of the rest of it.

Not being an expert in the field, I found myself a bit annoyed at the author's constant reminders of how revolutionary his thinking is.  Maybe he is a gianty in his field, I have no idea.  But continually being told so was a bit tedious. <br /> <br />Other than that, the thesis is very impressive.  The idea that the emergence of the isthmus of Panama could provoke a series of events that resulted in the emergence of our direct anecstors is really staggering.  Our species turns out to be fairly accidental, a sobering fact.   <br /> <br />The different themes are organized backwards by the author, so that the most fundamental and shocking things come last.  I don't think this strategy works too well.  It may be more dramatic, but the overall coherence and unity of the book suffers.  And the writing style is fairly mediocre.  I would enjoy seeing a better writer tackle the same subjects. <br /> <br />All in all, I would hesitatingly recommeend.	2005-09-17

The protagonists in legal thrillers are usually fairly annoying, in that the lawyer is transparently what the author wants so badly to be: an exciting hero instead of a paper-pushing money-grubber.  But the characters in this debut novel are actually quite compelling.  There is certainly a fair share of cliches (the beautiful but tough lady copy, her grizzled, wise-cracking male partner, the tough kid from the mean streets who escapes to become a rich lawyer), but somehow Hosp made it work for me.  He doesn't push the cliches over the top to the point where they are syrupy and gag inducing. <br /> <br />Because I live in Boston, the local scenery made it somewhat more interesting, but I would bet that it translates well to non-Bostonians. The plot is structured well, and the surprise villain at the end would really translate well to the big screen.  I forsee this book being made into a movie, easy.   <br /> <br />All in all, a great read.  I hope he can follow it up with another. <br /> <br />	2005-08-26

But it definitely read like an homage to Walter Mosley: ex-con who used to be the baddest mutha in the hood, constantly trying to avoid being dragged back into the deadly but futile game -- you get the idea.  <br /> <br />Maybe Pelecanos has a different demographic than Mosley, so he's hoping folks won't notice the similarity?  Who knows?  In any case, you're better off reading the Mosley books themselves.  They ring truer and sound more genuine. <br /> <br />In any case, this is not a bad novel.  You can make your way through it in a couple days.  The characters are nothing new, if you have experience with urban life.  Maybe that's what Pelecanos wanted: absolutely predictable characters to drive home the banality of crime, to perhaps deglamorize it.  But the plot just doesn't rise past the drabness of the cast.	2005-08-21

It's got cliched characters (the now low-ambition cop who got his family killed with his past renegade recklessness -- sound familiar?), and a superficially convoluted but ultimately guessable conspiracy style plot.  And all throughout is a non-veiled (I'd say \\"thinly veiled,\\" but there is really no veiling at all) allegory on Bush and the \\"war on terror.\\"  I guess if the author is trying to sneak some politics into the reading of folks who would normally bolt from such a thing, then good for him.  But for other people who actully know what's going on in the real political world, the allegorical stuff just comes off as tedious. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say, I only read this a week ago, and I've already forgotten how it ends, and also the name of the main character.

You won't find any screeching panic or pollyana cornucopianism here.  It's a detailed, mainstream, calm assessment of where we are with the carbon economy.  Roberts gives warnings where they are due, but also gives a generous benefit of the doubt to entrepreneurs and scientists, who may be able to find a way out of our mess. <br /> <br />The overall theme of the book, which I had not seen elsewhere, is that we should concentrate on TOTAL CARBON emissions.  It will not do us any good to rush into action right now, invest tons of money and effort in short term solutions, only to have to scrap them in the future and start all over again when we encounter critical limitations.  He suggests using a cap and trade emission system now,  to become gradually more stringent as time goes by.  We also need a bridging technology like clean coal or hydrogen (or a mix of the two) to get us to a point where we ultimately employ a long-term mixed strategy with renewables, clean carbon emergency backup systems, and any yet-to-be developed breakthrough technologies. <br /> <br />I only gave this a 4 instead of a 5 because it is written in a generally dry style, and thus takes a long time to plod through.

Every once in a while, a book comes along that radically rearranges your entire outlook on the world.  For me, \\"The Long Emergency\\" was just that.  Is it alarmist?  Absolutely.  Is it true?  Almost definitely.  Humankind has faced many obstacles in its brief history.  Famine, disease, ignorance, tyranny, hubris, you name it.  But in the years to come, civilization will come face to face with the laws of thermodynamics; and those laws do not bend. This book smacks the reader in the face with the dire consequences that await the world as we run out of cheap fossil fuels.  Since World War II, the United States especially has set its public policy as if the oil spigot was eternal.  We will pay dearly for that mistake.   <br /> <br />Many of the predictions here are not new.  Left literature is fairly conversant on the subjects of overshoot, non-sustainability, and potential global collapse.  But even more important here is Kunstler's bursting of the alternative energy balloon.  One of the main blind spots in liberal thinking is the belief that solar, wind, geothermal, and hydrogen power will magically step in to fill our energy needs.  This author makes mincemeat of those unrealistic hopes.  The simple fact is that we've built physical and psychological infrastructures that just will not work under any circumstances in the future.  Even with nuclear and coal brought into increasing play, the \\"Drive-In Utopia,\\" as Kunstler likes to call it, is over. <br /> <br />I cannot overemphasize the importance of this book.  Buy it, read it, then pass it on to someone else.  Then enrol in some sustainable building and farming courses to get yourself ready.  The end (of cheap energy) is nigh.	2005-05-15

This recent offering is a colorful and human rendition of our country's formative years.  The interplay between the giant figures of our nation's birth (Washington, Hamilton, Adams, Jefferson, Franklin, Marshall, and others) is fascinating, and illuminative of our contemporary struggles.  And rather than come down decisively on one side or the other (Federalists vs. Republicans), Vidal is careful to lay out the nuances of each position (although Hamilton does come off as a main villain, in many ways).   <br /> <br />Perhaps most intriguing is the dynamic of Jefferson's trust of popular wisdom.  He expected the American constitution to be torn down and rebuilt quite often, as scientific discoveries added to the great body of public knowledge.  After all, who wants to be in thrall to a beclouded past?  Franklin also expressed the view that if unchanged, the political arrangements of the United States would result in a course, cruel, and unjust society.  As recent times demonstrate, theological devotion to a piece of parchment scrawled by a hoary generation can result in social and political ridiculousness.  We perhaps need more Jeffersonians and Franklinites today, who are willing to jettison cheap patriotic fealty to the founding fathers in favor of a renewed trust in popular power and wisdom.  We clearly could use a new constitution, updated for the concerns of today.  The present version was conceived as a protector of privilege, and it functions the same today.	2005-03-18

The rest are, sad to say, fairly middle of the road.  I had read two of Orr's other books, \\"Earth in Mind\\" and \\"Ecological Literacy,\\" which were absolutely stunning.  But this effort is uneven.  There are certainly many practical and revolutionary suggestions for turning our earth's fate around, but most of them have been taken up with more conviction and detail by other authors.  There is a nagging sense here that Orr is kind of late to the game in some of his ideas, like undermining the idea of corporate personhood, or amending the constitution to include ecological concerns for our descendents.  <br /> <br />So while I do recommend this book, especially because Orr is such a graceful writer, I would suggest supplementing it with some harder hitting recent material (maybe \\"Unequal Protection\\" by Thom Hartmann, \\"Beyond Civilization,\\" by Daniel Quinn, or the collection of work done by POCLAD, \\"Defying Corporations, Defining Democracy,\\" available on [...]	2005-03-01

Man, this book is infuriating!  We often hear just how unequal the distribution of wealth has become in America.  We hear it so often, in fact, that we begin to think that inequality is just inherent in capitalism itself, the price we must pay for creative and entrepreneurial freedom.  But Johnston explodes this impression, outlining the exact mechanism of moving wealth upwards: the tax system.  And this is not a typical leftie book, bashing the Republicans for screwing over the little guy.  Johnston makes it perfectly clear that most of the systemic tax inequities and loopholes were put in place by Democrats.   <br /> <br />How, for example, could of group of tax avoiders take out a full page ad in USA Today, an ad that claims that the US government has no right to legally tax anyone, and not even get audited?  But that's just what happened. And we're not talking conspiracies here.  Johnston interviews dozens of current and former IRS employees, many of whom have entered the private sphere to sell their tax-dodging skills on the open market. And the picture is clear: the political donor class, who give to both Democrats and Republicans, have convinced their congressional lackeys to strip down the IRS so that it has no enforcement teeth anymore.  The result is dwindling tax receipts, and a surge in the easy auditing of the poor, who have no legal resources to tie up the IRS in the courts.  It's as simple as that. Since the 1970s, the proportion of taxes paid by corporations and the wealthy have plummeted, with poor and middle class wage earners picking up the slack.   <br /> <br />This book is crucial to understanding the class war that is being waged by the rich on everyone else. <br /> <br />	2005-02-19

He was discouraged on this night, and he relayed his thoughts on how to save rationalism in a seeming advancing tide of superstition and magical thinking.  He said something along the lines of, 'Forget trying to work with the adults, it's already too late for them. Concentrate on cultivating rational habits of mind among children, for whom there is still hope.' <br /> <br />This book by David Orr reminded me of that advice from Randi.  While progressives and environmentalists make worthy efforts to control the worst aspects of industrial civilization through regulation and policy changes, what often gets short shrift is education.  What is the use of treading water in the adult world of environmental destruction, if our children are still being taught to contribute to those very processes of civilization that do all of the damage?  Orr reminds us that the most difficult change that needs to happen is one of mindset, of formative ideas.  There are plenty of appropriate technologies out there to change the world, but we lack the political will and cultural mindset to implement what needs to be done.   <br /> <br />The best way to create that ecological mindset, or worldview, is to teach children from the earliest age that they are part of a wonderful but fragile ecosystem, one that needs their help and devotion to survive.  If we don't teach our daughters and sons that the earth is their home, and that processes that kill their home are ultimately suicidal, then all of the policy work and regulatory stop-gaps are worthless.  This is good stuff, well worth reading.	2005-01-30

I picked up this book because, living in the northeast, I wondered what happened to all of the animals in wintertime.  Which ones hibernate?  Which ones migrate?  Which ones die?  And I wasn't disappointed.  Heinrich provides ample explanations, in understandable language, of what happens to squirrels, birds, insects, turtles, trees, and others (although there isn't much about fish).  He is also a fantastic nature writer, weaving simple but elegant stories in and out of the science, stories mostly set in his two main observation sites, Vermont and Maine.  And the overriding theme of the whole book is the battle of animals to regulate their temperatures and metabolisms to avoid freezing, in the harsh food conditions of winter.  This is good introductory reading for anyone with questions about winter survival.	2005-01-30

I never did think that Dilbert was funny, and I really can't understand why it's still on the front page of the Sunday comics in my hometown paper, the Boston Globe.  The humor is crude, obvious, stupid, but worst of all, geekishly violent.  There is something about nerd threats of violence, something about the Star Trek viewer saying, \\"do you want me to smash your face in?\\", that I find nauseating and terrifying.  The crux of it is, doesn't Darla or whatever the hell her name is, realize that she couldn't really smash anyone's face in?  Don't office geeks understand that a lot of the people they work with would wipe the floor with them?  I guess they don't, which is what makes the Dilbert strip such a joke.  As Solomon notes, all of the frustration of modern capitalism, all of its meaninglessness and emptiness, expresses itself in workers' loathing of each other.  And while there is much hatred of bosses portrayed in Dilbert, there is no political element to it.  The comic strip simply allows reader-employees to engage in low, chuckling fantasies of violence perpetrated on their bosses, without any intimation that there might be another way to channel that rage.   <br /> <br />I guess my problem with Dilbert, which Solomon captures beautifully, is that its subject is ripe for true satire.  Office life screams for subversive parody, a la the movie \\"Office Space.\\"  But what we get with Dilbert is not satire, but awkward, junior high school fantasies of violecne, fantasies with no connection to social or physical reality.  When I read Dilbert, the first image that springs to mind is Columbine, which is no comic matter.	2005-01-12

Scheuer, a longtime CIA veteran specializing in al Qaeda, bin Laden, and Islamic insurgencies.  He lambastes both the Bush and Clinton administrations for their lies of ommission regarding terrorism, and he makes a pursuasive argument that our government has actually made things worse, not better.  And Scheuer is no leftie dove.  He repeatedly calls for the US to do one of two things: either change the foreign policies that give rise to militant Muslim responses, or go after the terrorists with every weapon we have. <br /> <br />The author explodes the ridiculous lie that Bush has been pushing since 9-11: that terrorists are insane, irrational murderers who only want to destroy the freedoms that Americans enjoy.  This Big Lie, that an innocent America is a victim only because of its very goodness and success, has prevented Americans from confronting the true roots of Islamic hatred towards the US: the several streams of anti-Muslim foreign policy that have been flowing for decades.  Everyone needs to read this book, so that we can, as citizens, demand an end to the unwinnable War on Terror.  Americans must know the truth about Islamic militancy, so that we can demand sweeping policy change, the only hope of saving lives and avoiding future attakcs.	2004-11-06

I have thought long and hard about how regular, so-called \\"conservative\\" people could become so riddled with opposing views.  Conservatives want the government out of their lives, unless it has to do with prayer and sex; then they want an aggressive theocracy.  Conservatives want small government, unless it's weapons; then the more the merrier.  They call for personal responsibility, unless it's the president leading us into a bogus war; then it's okay to pass the buck onto the CIA.  <br />Frank fleshes out the biggest whopper of them all: how can people who detest the \\"elite\\" continually vote for the richest, most powerful corporate chieftans, who then turn around and wreak havoc on the very communities that conservatives say they care about?  And Frank's answer is right on target.  Republicans strip the economics out of everything and run on the culture-war ticket.  They promise an overturn of Roe-v.-Wade, but then deliver a capital gains tax cut for billionaires.  And the rubes eat it up because the Dems have abondoned working-class constituents to chase corporate dollars like their more well-heeled GOP brethren.<br />This is best book I have read so far on the psyche of the conservative rank and file.

Huffington swerves from guffaw-seeking to self-important attempts at loftiness, and neither one really works. It seems as if she thinks that people have been waiting for her to deliver this oracle of advice to Democrats, so that we can now finally know how to take our country back. But despite her inflated sense of gravitas, there isn't much of substance in her prescriptions beyond the usual liberal fare. For funnier and more trenchant stuff, go with Al Franken and Michael Moore. For more interesting substance, see anything by Lewis Lapham, the current book from Thomas Frank (&quot;What's the Matter with Kansas?&quot;), or the David Corn book.	2004-05-30

Bush	Books	4	54	66	N	N	Not Your Average Bush-Basher	This is definitely NOT a cookie-cutter addition to the election-year avalanche of Dubya-drubbing.  This is a fascinating legal dissection of the secrecy strategies from someone who knows a bit about the subject.  Thinking back to Watergate, a relatively minor crime ballooned into the removal of a president because of the stratagems of cover-up.  And Dean lays out a compelling account of much worse attempts by the current regime to dodge accountability at every turn. It's worth buying in hardcover.	2004-05-30

Agriculture thrives on the disruption and destruction of natural processes.  The ensuing chaos, while manageable in its nascent forms, is very hard to stuff back into the box once industrial agriculture takes root, so to speak.<br />Manning then moves on to discuss the social and health ramifications of putting all of our nutritional eggs into the compact grain basket.  Corn has proven to be especially egregious in its full manifestations.  There is also a very thorough treatment of the political strategies for foisting cheap and destructive grains on the developing world and on our own populace. We always hear about those famous &quot;subsidies&quot; for agriculture, and Manning takes us through exactly what that means.<br />As with most social criticism, this book is long on description and relatively short on prescription.  Manning leaves most of the preaching implicit, with an occasional simple but revolutionary suggestion like, 'stop eating sugar and fat.'  But he is clear that our salvation does not lie with more green revolutions from the top down.  It will take a bottom-up food revolution, made up of organic farming, nutritional education, the rejection of soda beverages, local farmers markets, etc.  Manning's book is a great contribution to the struggle.	2004-04-07

Normally, when activists or the general public confront the sheer, imposing bulk of the corporatocracy, we get diagnoses of greed and corruption, with antidotes of regulation or resignation.  But what Hartmann uncovers is the very specific LEGAL history of how corporations came into being in their modern incarnation.  There are a handful of pivotal Supreme Court decisions that laid the tracks for the freight trains of abuse and audacity that then rolled on through, and all over regular citizens.<br />This is a very important insight.  Since the corporation's power is fairly narrowly and legally based, it can be undone as well.  The notion that we can regulate big companies into being good &quot;corporate citizens&quot; is nonsense if we don't withdraw the legal basis of their recognized rights.  Constitutional protections should be for natural citizens only, period.  We should be able to hold corporations to whatever standards we want, since they are simply artificial profit-machines with no inherent legal standing vis-a-vis the rights of natural citizens.  <br />As always, Hartmann's writing is engaging, precise, and exciting.  Buy this book!!	2004-03-15

For Americans used to reading narcissitic volumes from either the right or the left, this book is fantastic.  I don't pretend to know the economic trajectories of Russia, or the politcal contours of Japan, or other such wide-ranging topics; so I can't say whether his interpretation of the global picture is correct or not.  <br />But what I can say is that many of his characterizations of America ring true.  He calls the US the &quot;arsonist-fireman&quot; of the globe, stirring up trouble in little countries just so we (well, Bechtel and Halliburton really, but close enough) can then ride in on the white horse and fix everything that we broke.  His description of our foreign policy since the end of the Cold War as &quot;drunken-sailor diplomacy&quot; (a kind of clumsy, non-unified staggering about the planet) is a refreshing antidote to the usual elite conspiracy theories of the American left.<br />But maybe most importantly, and probably what offends many of the reviewers here, is that Todd doesn't take America all that seriously.  He certainly DOES acknowledge our military might (save the Army) and relative economic security at the moment, inegalitarian as it may be.  But he feels that the general policy direction that American leaders have taken (both Democrats and Republicans) will render the United States increasingly superfluous.  And I would have to agree.  The end of the Cold War provided an opportunity to dismantle most of our military and turn our focus back inwards, towards self-sufficiency and ecological sustainability.  But instead, we have preserved our Cold War global military reach (over 700 acknowledged military bases in over 130 countries), fudged around both openly and covertly in countries everywhere, morphed the evil communism threat into an evil network of satanic terrorists, and allowed a regal corporate plutocracy to emerge at home.  <br />As American citizens, it's our job to throw out the bozos, both Republicans and Democrats, who are leading this country into irrelevance.  Rising per capita income and American corporate competitiveness doesn't help the US if all the rewards are reaped by the elite, leaving the rabble with obese bodies, swollen prisons, 4-hour daily commutes, and negative net worth (all realities right now for many Americans).<br />Be brave!  Buy this book, read it, and pass it on.  It's a new perspective worth considering.  Besides, all those Germans and Frenchmen can't be wrong.	2004-03-13

It seems that anyone who criticizes a Republican is deemed a wild leftie communist. Well, Krugman is certainly not far left, and his dissection of the Bush 2 administration in this book is not radically progressive.<br />Krugman is a fairly mainstream economist.  He seems to generally support the trajectory of capitalism: free markets, globalization, liberal trade policies, etc.  And indeed, his pieces were fairly sedate when he first began as a NYT columnist.  But as the Dubya administration unfolded, Krugman became more and more flabbergasted with the outright fiscal and policy lies that were spewing forth, unchallenged, from Bush and his ilk.  <br />For someone who reads a steady dose of progressive media, many of Krugman's observations come as old news. But his strenghth is his style, laser-focused and straightforward.  He outlines just how easy it is to tear apart the numbers that the Bush junta passes off as truth.  And Krugman seems most upset with his fellow journalists, who give the administration a pass on their ridiculous clowning with the truth.  <br />As with any book compilation of columns, one risks re-reading things already seen in real time.  But Krugman has added a nice, lenghthy introduction with his overall suspicions about the Bush administration's ultimate goals.  Good stuff.	2004-03-13

Books	4	4	6	N	N	More Comedic Dissection from an Oscar Rabble-Rouser	As with Al Franken's book, it is bittersweet for a concerned citizen to go through &quot;Dude.&quot;  Many of his criticisms are right on, but it's a shame that we have to hear it from comedians and filmmakers.  If our mainstream (corporate) press was doing its job, then the American public would have been exposed to the ridiculousness of Dubya's crony-ocracy a long time ago.  So much for the &quot;liberal media.&quot;<br />This book is pretty much the same fare as his previous book, &quot;Stupid White Men&quot;: scathing and funny chapters on the fairly-easy-to-uncover motives behind Bush's dismantling of America to the profit of his oil buddies and Schizo-Christian base.  Especially interesting is his chapter on the Saudi connection to 9/11 and the murkiness which still surrounds the Bush family's connections to the country that actually produced the suicide terrorists.  I have heard that his next movie will be on that very subject, but I could be wrong.  <br />In any case, lefties should read this book and pass it around amongst themselves, and righties should bash it as communist babble from a fat, traitorous, atheist scumbag -- and then all will be right with the world.  But if Michael Moore is right about the country being essentially liberal (a subject in this book), then there may be hope for America after all.	2004-03-13

You can say whatever you want about Johnson's polemics or Bush-bashing; but honestly, what in the hell do we need that many military bases for, especially in a post-Cold War world where there are no major military adversaries worth speaking of?  Did those bases stop 9/11?  Are those bases preventing ethnic and tribal violence around the globe?  No chance.<br />Then why do we have all those bases?  Prof. Johnson's answer is something that all Americans should take seriously.  Our expansive military presence around the globe is a simple display of our willingness to use violence to protect strategic resources and to intimidate other countries that may challenge American dominance.  So what's wrong with that, one might ask?  Well, it pisses other people off, spawns terrorist violence against the US, portrays a primitive image of Americans as bullying thugs, and costs a hell of a lot of money.  <br />Let's take apart half those bases, rejoin the international community, and turn our patriotic fervor inwards to the domestic issues that scream for attention.	2004-03-12

I've found some of his writings very tough going.  He's definitely not a story-teller.  You won't get lofty narratives with a lot of trendy catch-phrases like &quot;the end of history,&quot; or &quot;the coming anarchy,&quot; or anything like that.  What you do get is a devotion to texts and sources, an obsession with mining the actual documents that make up political policy.  Is everything he writes about absolutely correct all of the time?  Of course not.  But you can bet that his assertions always rest on some credible source.  Critics are always lambasting him for his twisting of the facts.  But if you examine his sources closely, they are predominently either official (declassified government documents) or highly reliable ones (corroborrated eyewitness accounts or human rights reports).  And you can be sure that his critics' ideas of what is &quot;true&quot; are based on much shakier ground, like corporate media pap or PR-industry crafted government press releases.<br />I found this book to be easier going than some of his other works.  It is a systematic treatment of the alarming imperial trends of recent American foreign policy.  And far from a simple Marxist denunciation of America as bad, it is a thorough examination of the gulf that has emerged between the actions of the American power elite and the understanding of regular citizens as to what is being done in their name.  A main question that emerges is, &quot;how many times do Americans need to learn of their own government's crimes after the fact (through classified documents released decades after events occur) before they will learn to distrust the propaganda that they hear in real time?&quot;  Chomsky's disentanglings of the past help us cut through the garbage that is spewed by our current leaders to justify the imperial and greedy desires of the power/policy elite.	2004-02-02

Jon asked him a long, drawn-out question about why it fell to Al Franken to write a book exposing the lies and half-truths of the right-wings pundits.  After all, Jon asked, isn't the mainstream media policing itself and tearing all the Limbaugh-Hannity-Coulter crap to shreds?  After this long, 30-second, serious question, Franken paused, looked away for a second, and just said, &quot;no&quot; (that the media wasn't doing its job).  <br />This one-word answer sums up the frustration and delight that come with reading Franken's book.  It is a well-written, funny, nicely-researched, and angry volume.  For those who read progressive news on a regular basis, there is nothing new here.  But it's disconcerting that it takes humorists to get people's attention regarding our most important public issues.  If the American people (I balk at using the word &quot;citizens,&quot; because of general American idiocy) would pay as much attention to serious journalism as they do to the latest flavors of Doritos, then maybe Al Franken and his ilk could go back to show business where they belong.  <br />But I do recommend this book.  Buy it, read it, and then loan it to someone else to read it.	2003-11-05

Indeed, the thorough review of the failures of American Winner-Take-All elections is impressive.  Phenomena like voter apathy, low turnout, campaign smear tactics and sound-bite politics are all expertly traced back by Hill to the systematic marginalization that is the hallmark of our Winner-Take-All electoral scheme.  But this book is infuriatingly redundant.  Don't get me wrong -- I love reading; can't get enough.  But this book is so repetitive as to try any book lover's patience.

As we continue down the numbing path of modern &quot;civilization,&quot; the anarcho-primitivist critique becomes more obviously true.  As I made my way through Zerzan's essays, a radical split emerged in my consciousness.  On the one hand, we're enmeshed in day-to-day struggles and anxieties, the all-consuming attention required just to scrape by and maintain some sense of sanity (and this in one of the more affluent societies on the planet).  But Zerzan's stance is like a slap in the face.  I began to see just how ridiculous and dehumanizing the entire modern system is.  This dissonance between civilization's maximum-seriousness demands and our personal awareness that it's all a huge sham is essentially the substance of alienation, a theme which most liberals have abandoned, but which Zerzan always keeps central. Alienation is still the most explosive analytical tool for confronting our current situation. <br />Anarcho-primitivism may not have the most useful prescriptive program, but its descriptive power is unparalleled.  The anarcho-primitvist goal is certainly utopian, but that is a good thing.  Without utopian goals, we can have no transcendent position from which to challenge the present order. The intermediate mechanisms of change, through which we must work toward the utopian anarcho-primitivist future, should be the true program of liberalism.  The left has condemned itself to irrelevancy by ignoring its utopian strand in favor of technical tinkering.  We must recover our utopian roots in order to bear anarcho-primitivist fruit.	2003-02-16

Another reviewer said it best: Pilger is like Noam Chomsky, only he's a better writer.  Exactly.  Pilger's work is an inspiring blend of poingnant personal interviews, on-the-ground examination of \\"failed states,\\" and laser-like analysis of the Orweillian spin machines of the New Imperialists. There really are sections of this book which will move you to tears.<br />It is a pathetic testament to the brain-dead nature of homo consumptus that anyone could actually accuse Pilger of \\"left-wing fundamentalism,\\" or of being obsessed with imaginary conspiracies of the powerful.  Clearly these are the ridiculous attestations of folks who get their \\"news\\" from corporate talking heads and radio imbeciles.  When someone like Pilger comes along and actually does journalism (that is, actually GOES to the places that others only read off of Teleprompters about), the brutality that comes to light is profoundly disorienting.  Such is the distance of the rich from the truth.<br />Please buy this book, especially for the section on Iraq.  I defy anyone to read this chapter and then make a cogent case for attacking this country that has been decimated by war, dictatorship, and blockade.  The violence of neo-imperial countries like the US and Britain can only survive if their citizens remain aloof and alienated from their brothers and sisters on the ground in the victim states.  Pilgers's work explodes that complacency and ignorance.  We need a hundred or even a thousand Pilgers.	2003-01-11

It was amusing to read the reviews which describe Lazare as a \\"socialist.\\"  Socialism, technically, means state ownership of the means of production, and/or the absence of private property.  Needless to say, you will find neither in this book.  It is also interesting to note how conservatives tend to use the pjorative term \\"mob rule\\" instead of the proper word, \\"democracy.\\"  God forbid that the rebellious rabble who comprise most of society actually rise up to demand a fair share of the American Pie.<br />In any case, Lazare's arguments are forceful and beyond dispute.  What have our vaunted limited government and hallowed checks and balances brought us? Crumbling cities, reactionary civic religion, an explosively growing gap between rich and poor, political apathy, and cultural stagnation. Because the Constitution is so difficult to change, we have opted to let the economy do everything.  The results of this political abdication are obvious.  Citizens would not even know where to begin, would they ever want to actually assert their collective will to make society more humane by acting through their polity.<br />Investing an elected parliament with supreme federal power is actually to best way to make government more efficient, responsive to the people (I'm not part of a \\"mob,\\" I'm part of We the People), and capable of ensuring our civil liberties. As we careen towards war in Mesopotamia, led by a shrubby dictator, our civil liberties are squashed at home without a peep from our nine supreme judicial protectors.  This is \\"limited government\\" as the Founders intended?  I'm with Lazare.  Let's find a way to scrap our moldy old Constitution and put something in its place that actually embodies democracy.

Any honest assessment of our current situation will result in pessimism and cynicism.  To grasp the nature of our environmental, demographic, economic, and ideological trajectories is to look insanity and collapse square in the face.  But eventually, one must turn from critique to creation.  This is what it means to have a social imagination: the ability to understand the present and envision realistic possibilities for the future.  And social imagination is what is almost completely absent from our present situation.  Instead, we have ridiculous techno-optimism, reckless free-marketeerism, and jingoistic flag-waving.  That is why Richard Douthwaite's book is so impressive.  It is an incredible blend of intelligent criticism and embodied social imagination.  Unlike so many works on the ills of society, which are usually 95% analysis and 5% half-hearted wishful thinking, &quot;Short Circuit&quot; devotes ample space to solutions that are in place right now.  He chronicles the many efforts by regular people to recapture their economies and their resources from sprawling, globalized systems.  Read in conjunction with E.F. Schumacher's &quot;Small Is Beautiful&quot; and Michael Shuman's &quot;Going Local,&quot; this book is one of the three pillars of contemporary decentralism.  Decentralism is the logical end-point for serious thought on the perils of globalization.  Buy this book, read it, re-read it, give it away, and then repeat.	2001-08-13

And yes, McWilliams often seems too much in love with his own writing style.  But it would be hard to overestimate the importance of this book.  It is a history book, a civics primer, a superior treatise on practical ethics, and an irreverently funny satire.<br />Each section of this book is relatively self-contained, since it is not really meant to be read straight through.  The reader can pick and choose his/her own order without losing the overall argument.  As such, it would make an excellent reference book for home and for schools of any level.<br />By the time you navigate the entire text, it becomes obvious that McWilliams was not just an arrogant, well-off, indifferent atheist who wanted to be left alone to smoke pot and engage in non-traditional activities.  What emerges is the incredible wastefulness and hypocrisy that grows out of a society and legal system that won't let people take responsibility for their own lives.  It's not that we shouldn't have rules and mores to check dangerous behavior.  It's just that these behavioral controls are not the government's responsibility -- they're OUR responsibility.  When we come to rely on the government to enforce morality and civility, then we have abdicated our duty to be adults.	2001-08-06

This book will help us resist the disingenuous calls for healing and looking forward, and it should certainly be re-read in the summer of 2004.

It is not just an updated &quot;The Jungle,&quot; filled with page after page of details (although there is certainly some  stomach-churning stuff in there).

The complex of factors that leads us to eat too much, to eat the wrong things, to exploit slaughterhouse and fast-food workers, to turn our land into strip-malls, and to treat living animals as assembly-line commodities must be overturned.

This book is not an anti-globalization rant or a leftie-luddite treatise.  What MacArthur has done is document the inner workings of an important &quot;trade agreement,&quot; demonstrating that the triumph of the market is not an inevitable historical trend.  Rather, the grand sweep of &quot;globalization&quot; is a project, a designed task, pushed through with real and purposive power.  The job of pundits, CEOs, PR firms and politicians is to make the rank and file feel like the collapse of non-economic imperatives is the natural unfolding of history. <br />MacArthur's book documents the kinds of things that citizens should be aware of as they happen, not ten years later in a searing expose.  We need to shine a searchlight on our government right now, to uncover the backroom deals and smarmy PR snow-jobs that presently constitute the real substance of American politics.

Quinn evokes that exhaustion we all sometimes feel with the absurdity of civilization's  clamorings.  It seems to me that this book comes at a time when more and  more people are desiring a simpler, more secure, less volatile lifestyle.   Many of us inherently share Quinn's view that more and bigger programs are  not going to fix things, because they themselves are part of a large-scale  world that has little relation to what people really need and want as human  beings.  I was a little disappointed to see Quinn dismiss  &quot;communes&quot; as good examples of tribal living.  The contemporary  Intentional Community movement has come a long way since the 60s (see  [...] and there are many different communities and groups carving  out social AND physical space in a manner similar to what Quinn espouses.   But this book should be part of everyone's library.	2000-05-03

All throughout, the reader can sense Fox's frustration with his colleagues and with humanity's view of itself in general.  This is a plea for the longest kind of perspective, one that  recognizes the horrifically-disturbing blip that history represents on the  5-million year timeline that is the human story.  Fox makes it unabashedly  clear that if we do not embrace an evolutionary view of ourselves, we are  destined to live in out-of-control, frustrating, dehumanizing societies.   The closest thinker that I have found to Fox is Paul Shepard, another  brilliant scholar who shreds the boundaries of disciplines.  But Fox is  even bolder in his challenge to the academy and it's Enlightenment  heritage, dismissing as useless much of the classic thought, as well as the  current drivel -- since neither considers the full ethical implications of  a Darwinian worldview.  Great stuff!	2000-04-20

True, you will not find a detailed, balanced sociololgical treatise.  But we shouldn't expect that kind of report from a journalist.  What we do get in this book is the assurance of  first-hand exposure to some of the planet's most serious areas of concern.   Like Paul Kennedy's &quot;Preparing for the 21sy Century,&quot; Kaplan's  book blows away the myths of globalization optimism, painting a world that  is coming square into contact with some hard ecological and demographic  realities.	2000-03-13

Each time through, you will pick up more, and slowly your view of the world will change.  In this book, Shepard weaves together anthropology,  psychology, social criticism, and prehistory to paint a picture of what we  used to be, what we are now, and what we can be in the future.  More  specifically, Shepard urges us to recapture the form of hunter-gathering.   This is not to say that we can turn back the clock of history and go back  to the caves.  Rather, he is espousing a closer contact with the natural  world, which is the only thing that can trigger the crucial psychological  transitions that make up our lifecycle.  Without this kind of exposure to  the Otherness of the real world, we remain locked in adolescence and even  pre-adolescence, unable to maturely experience the people and places around  us.  Read this book, then read &quot;Nature and Madness&quot;, then read  his other books --- then REREAD them, over and over.  His stuff is that  good.	2000-01-19
