I am also a trained Montessori teacher.  I have used cloth diapers with my son from the time he was one-month-old.  I have seen many children toilet train before age 2.<br /><br />So, I came to this book agreeing with some of what the author had to say.  I think she makes a good case for changing our society's preconceptions about toilet training, but this book is short on extensive practical advice that parents (and teachers) need.<br /><br />The author does not approve of any sort of diaper, particularly disposables.  However, she recommends cloth diapers as a lesser of 2 evils sort of thing.  Her advice on laundering diapers is laughably out-of-date (treated wet pail, wash 3 times(!), etc.).  Washing machines are far more evolved than the author realizes, and I would not use cloth diapers if it were as much trouble as she describes.  She even thinks you still have to pin prefolds.<br /><br />Some of the ideas in this book are useful, but it will have to be supplemented with books that go into greater detail.  It cannot be the only book you read for potty training info.<br /><br />If you want to read a book written by someone with very strong opinions about early potty training and the problems with diapers, then you may like this book.  If you want a more balanced approach, I would pass over this one.	2005-07-19

I really liked the Homebirth and Choices in Childbirth sections.  However, some of the book's information contradicts standard advice, such as what makes breasts sag, and how to prepare breasts for breastfeeding, and the author makes no effort to cite this advice.  Also, if you have a low-carb lifestyle, or make any effort at all to watch your carb intake, you'll have to ignore all the advice on nutrition.  Drinking regular soda, full of high fructose corn syrup, is actually advised as being rich in carbohydrates!  I suppose it is, but not the kind that you want to be consuming.  <br />Also, the advice on medication during pregnancy was not useful.  I'm sure that every pregnant woman would prefer not to take any medications, but unfortunately, many otherwise healthy women do have issues that require treatment.  For instance, I would be in very bad health without any allergy medicine, and although the book leads you to believe that all antihistimines are extremely dangerous, that is simply not true.  My midwife approved a mild nose spray for my allergies that is condsidered safe.  <br />I would use this book as a supplement to other information, but I think it is not accurate enough to be used as your ONLY book for pregnancy.  And, please, check out any information that sounds strange.	2003-08-31

Asimov didn't have the most exciting life, but even so, he makes the events of his life sound very interesting, and there are some extremely funny stories.  The style is chatty--it makes you feel like Isaac Asimov is an old friend.  The book would have been better if a few of the parts were cut; he discusses every book, including all the nonfiction ones that he ever wrote.  Overall, it is a fast read, despite its length, it entertained me, and made me want to read more Asimov.	2003-02-20

It has a large amount of information about many, many diarists, and different genres of diaries.  The author effectively conveys his enthusiasm for the topic, and it made me want to read many of the diaries in the book.  (I found out that we only read the boring part of Pepys diary in high school English, and that there are all sorts of racy parts!)  <br />As interesting as this book is, there was a little too much breadth at times and not enough depth.  So many diarists were discussed in each chapter that I felt I would have to take notes to remember the ones I was interested in.  Also, the transitions between diaries are rather awkward; I think this book would have been better in an encyclopedic rather than narrative format.  <br />I think that this book is an excellent reference for anyone interested in the history of diaries.	2003-02-18

It discusses the special mind of the child, and how nurturing the special potentialities that only children have is the only way to change (and save) humanity.  Montessori's theories are particularly interesting today in light of recent neurological discoveries, especially those related to critical periods and language.  <br />This is a very dense book, and requires a good deal of concentration and time to read.  I would recommmend The Child in the Family as the first book for one wanting an overview of Montessori ideas.	2003-02-13

The style is very entertaining, and it explains concepts of genetics in an engaging way.  It also discusses the dangers and limitations of science, and exposes molecular biologists who publish their results in popular magazines before their work is accepted to peer-reviewed journals.  <br />Marks argues emphatically for humane treatment of chimpanzees and other primates, but not for giving them human rights.  Why?  Because they are not human.  As Marks says, we can't expect to send a chimp to jail for killing another chimp.   <br />Marks is of the perspective that human culture is the strongest force governing our behavior, not genetics.	2003-02-03

I found it to be very inspirational, and enjoyed it even more than Still Me.  Mr. Reeve discusses in detail the emotional impact of his accident, and how his family helped him to regain his will to live.  I liked hearing his views on parenting, religion, and politics.  He comes across as very sincere, even detailing his experiences with the Christian Scientists and another alternative group, in his quest for spirituality.  <br />It is truly amazing what he has been able to accomplish with his type of injury.  First of all, his surviving that type of injury was nothing short of miraculous, and now he has regained some movement and sensation, far beyond what Western medicine previously believed possible.  <br />I believe that he has completely changed the way people are going to view spinal cord injuries from now on.  It is truly incredible what one person can do by refusing to give up.	2003-02-03

It portrays a close, loving relationship between the two, and explains in a very simple and positive way how the grandfather perceives the world without his visual sense.  The accompanying drawings are simple and artistic.  It is so difficult to find realistic, beautiful books for children, but this one is absolutely wonderful.  I give it my highest recommendation.	2002-11-06

Not only was it a wonderful story that allowed me to identify with the characters, but it left me questioning my own ideas and philosophies on life.  The characters are very dynamic, and the different chapters are written form the varied perspectives of the 5 female members of the family.  My favorite character was Adah, both gifted and disabled, who does not speak and sees the world from a &quot;backwards&quot; perspective.  <br />It seems like the kind of book that I will reread someday and enjoy and understand it more.	2002-01-10

I have used it in addition to a class I'm taking.  I think that the first section of the book, an overview of yoga, is extremely informative and fun to read.  Also, it's an attractive book, with glossy pages and a bold font.  I do not think it is suitable for a beginner as the ONLY book.  A video, or ideally, a teacher, is necessary to benifit from this book.  <br />I only gave this book 4 stars because I thought that the written descriptions of the postures could be more clear and less abstract.  I also felt that the author should have included more modifications of poses for us less-flexible folks.	2001-11-20

I think it's one of the best books I have read about being a teenager.  Mark is as pensive as Salinger's Holden, but this book always makes me laugh, whereas Catcher in the Rye makes me cry.  I agree with the reviewer who said that it has mature content, especially about marajuana, but the &quot;musings about sex&quot; are negligable.  I would recommend it to anyone 12 or older, as nothing in it would be shocking to most of today's youth.  Not only is the book funny, but it also explores more serious issues, such as parent/teenager relationships, ambition, even the meaning of life.  I particularly liked the depiction of Mark's father.  <br />My favorite aspect of this book is that the author/narrator is not afraid to laugh at himself.	2001-11-20

It's also an interesting commentary on academia, the art world.  Contemporary issues such as class and rape are also explored.  However, it was the story of the chilling relationship between the two women that hooked me and wouldn't let me put the book down.  I think that this book can be read on many levels.  I enjoyed reading it for pleasure, but it is dense enough for all kinds of literary analysis.	2001-11-20

Sagan is an entertaining and engaging author, and in this book he is doing what he does best: making scientific ideas accessible to the public.  Sagan makes a plea for skeptical thinking, and he explains why science does not, as many people feel, take the wonder and joy out of life.  He argues that it can actually increase these qualities.  As a non-scientist, this book gave a me a much more positive attitude towards science.	2001-11-19

I stayed in a small village in Central Anatolia for a total of 12 weeks over 2 summers studying archaeology.  The second summer, my husband and I travelled in Western Turkey for 2 weeks.  Neither of us really knew what we were doing (or knew much Turkish).  We depended on the Lonely Planet to find out how to get to the places we are going and where to stay and eat.  I have read several guides, and the Lonely Planet has the best practical information, although I did notice some small inaccuracies.  <br />I would suggest supplementing the Lonely Planet with another guide that has more archaeological and historical information, if you are interested in it.  Also, you will need a book or the advice of a friend to help you narrow down what to see.  The Lonely Planet can leave you overhwelmed.	2001-11-18

I had heard many great things about Irving and am interested in the issue of abortion.  I was very frustrated with the characters' inability to take charge of their lives; they were all so unwilling to change that they had no chance of happiness.  Also, I thought that most of the characters lacked complexity.  Also, prochoice or prolife, I don't think this book promotes a level of complex thinking on the aborition issue or could alter anyone's perspective.  For me, this book became a chore to read.	2001-11-18

It covers issues such as purebred vs shelter, kitten vs adult cat, feeding, litter training, claw clipping, ear cleaining, teeth brushing, introducing the cat to other pets, and common illnesses.  It also addresses such contraversial issues as keeping cats exclusively indoors and declawing.  <br />It's enjoyable to read, and it was helpful to my husband and me when we brought our first kitty home.  It's a good overall reference book, but it does lack depth on many subects.  And, as a now experienced cat person, I am not sure I completely agree with all of the author's suggestions, but I do think that he offers good, sound advice for the first-time cat owner.	2001-11-18

The commercials, news, and information that we are constantly bombarded with are major themes of this book.  Other themes include coping with seeming meaninglessness, and American obsessions with death and the desire to be happy ALL THE TIME.  <br />It's not a book you pick up for an easy read.  It was assigned to me in an English class.  Pick it up when you're in the mood fro something different and experiemental.  The only problem I had with the book was that I didn't particularly like any of the characters.	2001-11-17

This one has always been my favorite. Montgomery's humor is wry and sometimes sarcastic, showing a side of her writing style that is only sometimes apparent in her other books. (..) However this is not a children's book. It can certainly be enjoyed by older children, but also by teenagers adults. It is the story of a woman who, at near middle age, finally finds herself after being afraid of what others think all of her life. It's a rebellious, funny, romantic, even achingly sad book, and it is one of my all time favorites.	2001-11-17

It is great for stimulating your own imagination.  Vonnegut gives us an alternative version of reality that is a little frightening to some people.  In this book, you will meet weird and interesting characters, you will be presented with some far-out ideas about government, and gravity will no longer be constant.  The book is fun, impossible, insane, and it is NEVER EVER boring.  If you want to find out what the human imagination is capable of, read this book.	2001-10-28
