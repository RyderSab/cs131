The wonderful thing about the last three collections of Campbell's work (Pathways..., Myths Of Light, Thou Art That), is the personal manner of thought.  These works are mostly transcribed lectures, many of which can be found on tape.  They differ from his formal published work in that there is a direct, concise transmission of ideas--almost a 'folksy' manner of speaking at times.  This lends itself to a more enjoyable understanding of Campbell than the more 'scholarly' of his works. <br /> <br />Or to re-state this on a more critical level, these works allow Campbell's own thoughts about myth to be portrayed, instead of the heavy lens of his teachers shadowing him such as in his early works. <br />	2004-12-29

It's got all the Crichton stuff:  simple characters, quick chapters, interesting plot, technological tidbits.  However, this time he's added a political factor which happens to be about Global Warming and the Media/Political/Activist machine, challenging popular thought and providing footnotes (a little distracting to be sure) to help his case.  Wherever you stand on Global Warming, it is always refreshing to have someone ask for maturity in interpreting data.  Crichton provides enough sources for the interested reader to seek out and confirm the data.  The questions he raises are very interesting. <br />As for the story itself it does fall apart at the end, just as it did in his last novel, Prey.  It is a bit disappointing to be deep into a page-turner and then have it skid off the road at the last.  But the ride was fun along the way! <br />	2004-12-29

As an avid Tom Wolfe fan who has enjoyed his first two works of fiction, I was excited by this third one, but it is unfortunately Tom's first strike. <br />The story idea and Tom's intent to portray modern college life are interesting, but he fails in accomplishing both.  The story itself is rather contrived and the attempt to describe, accurately, young adult life in college comes across as...well, as an 80-year old man trying to describe young adult life in college. <br />Not to say that an 80-year old can't do that (if anyone could, it would've been Wolfe!), but his descriptions of language, idioms, mannerisms, music, interests, etc. are all slightly off the mark.  He didn't pull it off, and the reader is disconnected. <br />I appreciate the attempt, but it just didn't work out. <br />On a superficial level, the book is an O.K. read.  It flows quickly and some scenes are entertaining.  But if you are anxious for Tom's artful reporting/fictional style that worked well in his last two novels, it is sadly absent here.	2004-11-22

Shermer's discussion of morality in this book is a continuation of that he started in How We Believe, though that book was less dry and more complete.  Still, he bravely tackles morality with an approach not unlike Nietsche's (one must drop the crutch of religion and take responsibility for their own morals) only less angry and more scientific (hence the dryness).  Shermer does do a fair job of trying to explain the beauty of individual moral responsibility, but the book concerns mainly the historical or 'evolutionary' explaination of morals, in that they serve a societal function.  (A good companion book to this would be Sagan's Shadows Of Forgotten Ancestors.)<BR>Shermer's lens seems greatly shaped by Darwin.  That may be because one of his books between How We Believe and this on was In Darwin's Shadow (about Alfred Wallace), or perhaps Darwin's science is pretty solid stuff.  At any rate, to apply a scientific approach to morality is to try and replace thousands of years of mythology which did the job until recently.  Can morality be explained without religious ties?  That's the interesting part of it.<br />I was going to give this book 4 stars because of the slight disappointment I had with Shermer's writing style, but the topic is so vast and this book gives one of the best discussions of it I've seen in a long time.  So it's a Fiver!	2004-02-05

One may not agree with Moore's bull-in-a-china-shop style, but his points and questions about the Bush administration are fascinating, and for two reasons:  1) they are things that are unanswered, and 2) why doesn't anybody else in the news media ask these things or follow these stories?  These are things that everyone asks themselves when listening to speeches by Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Ashcroft, etc., because something just doesn't make sense, and these people seem to be consciously trying to confuse things even more.<br />Moore can't be brushed off.  He provides facts, figures, and cites.  And while the book is mildy humorous in its writing, it will disturb any American who believes in all the ideals that make us great.<br />Moore doesn't provide much in the way of answers, but his book sure opens the can of worms and throws away the lid.

A good lesson I've learned (forgive me, I'm slow) is to check facts before believing sensationalism.  I've enjoyed 'expose' books about the left and the right (I refuse to label myself as either because I think, like most americans probably do, that there are good points on both sides).  But an error I've made is to believe what is written for the most part, because I actually had faith that publishers do fact-checking before printing something.  Now, I understand that anecdotes usually are unprovable, but quoted facts and figures are.<br />So, when someone like Al Franken goes to the trouble to check facts and figures and finds that recent bestselling authors (and/or their ghostwriters) mis-quote, lie, and do other slimely things in print, I am ashamed for the publishing world.<br />Not that publishers and the media are saints, but I actually had some faith that they tried to be truthful.  And when a fact is found to be false, they admit it.  But my faith is shattered.<br />The American way blesses those like Al Franken who expose this stuff.  Plus, he does it with a razor sharp wit.  It is no wonder that this little guy is causing so much anger amongst the right wing group.  They can't blow off being proven as liars.  He should now write a book exposing the lies of the left's sensationalists.	2003-09-08

These books are just perfect echoes of Campbell's comparative conclusions, only more concise.  After a lifetime of work, his lectures honed his thoughts into great clarity.  These two books are actually great introductions to Campbell's thoughts and work.  They touch here and there on historical evidence, but mainly stay in the line of clarifying what occident and orient mythology entails.  <BR>If you've been waiting a long time to read more Campbell, you'll have bought these books already.

I agree with most of what Goldberg says, although some things are anecdotal or purposefully 'uncited' to protect people (I assume he means to protect those still working for CBS who want to speak but are afraid of repercussions, which is quite silly in the face of what he wants this book to do).  It's a quick read, and an enjoyable balance to 'liberal' expose's like last years Blinded By The Right, even though that dealt with politics and Bias deals with news media.<BR>I didn't like the constant use of exclamation points and italics throughout the book.  It felt like Goldberg was shouting too much, and that makes things suspicious when one does that.  I also kept wondering why this book focused so much on Dan Rather.  Goldberg wholly admits that &quot;The Dan&quot; had him fired for speaking out, but it's petty to slam &quot;The Dan&quot; out of sour grapes.<BR>Also, the constant attempt to 'label' everyone either liberal or conservative gets a little old.  I'm sure there are quite a number of one-dimensional people in the news media who can be labeled as such, but I'm not sold that it's a majority and there's some pervasive clear-cut agenda by them.<BR>Nonetheless, the 'liberal' slant to the newsmedia is obvious to anyone with a tv and it's interesting to see that someone from the 'inside', a journalist, is not allowed to report facts of industry self-investigation.	2003-01-23

I don't think there are many people who are oblivious to the underhanded tactics conservatives use, but it is good to see someone brave enough to speak openly about them.  I would've given the book 5 stars, except that it seems to be two books--one about neo-conservativism, and another about Brock's coming-out.  I can see why Brock wrote about his sexual-orientation:  to show his motivations for joining and then leaving the neo-cons, but the issue seemed way too dominant in this book and distracted from the neo-con tract.  Other than that, it's a great book.<BR>Now, Brock should look at the other side, liberalism, and do the same kind of book exposing their tactics, although I don't think there would be any surprising difference, but it would balance things out.

Freudian psychology and all its subjective claptrap are certainly dead artifacts of the past century, but the compassionate rules of what WORKS in therapy have been captured by Yalom.  He's done this before three decades ago in a heavier work called, &quot;Existential Psychotherapy&quot;.  Yalom deals mainly with the here-and-now, with the full compassion ('with'-'suffering') of another person in helping them find their own path.  And as Thomas Paine said &quot;...for what path could be better?&quot;<BR>Yalom brings smart humanity and humbleness to the art of therapy.

I have always admired Wolfe's ability to describe the social landscape in artful precision, and these essays (plus novella) are no exception.  The parts I found most enjoyable were his takes on the evolutionary-biology-neurology rise, the bio of Silicon Valley's founder, and the fun he had with the New Yorker in his early days.  One of the things that makes Wolfe great is his perpetual optimism and wonder about the new.  I didn't care for the novella all that much (I'd already read it in Rolling Stone).  It's a bit flat.  Also the little essay about criticism and Updike, Mailer, and Irving was a bit disturbing.  It seems to me that both camps are wrong:  the modern novel should not be pigeon-holed; there are many different styles of writing a work of fiction and neither Wolfe or his critics have an appropriate stand to dictate otherwise.	2001-10-11

This book is concerned mainly with mythos (meaning) versus logos (symbol) and how many people get caught up in symbols, thus missing the meaning (the mistake most fundamentalists are trapped in).  As always with Campbell, his explanations are so eloquent and educated that one cannot help but want more.  The only complaint I have about this book is its size--only 100 pages of Campbell's writing (mostly from lectures and notes).  It certainly could have been expanded to twice that with very little effort.  However, for those used to Campbell's written work, they will be pleasantly surprised how different his lecturing is.  <BR>One mistake the editor, and many a reviewer, make is to try and say that Campbell focuses on the Judeo-Christian aspect of symbol abuse.  If one were to read all of Campbell's work, they would find this to be quite wrong.  Campbell is not so shallow.  His concern is mythology, all of it, world-round.  In fact, the majority of his work focuses on primitive mythology.  He certainly spoke and expounded on the Judeo-Christian aspect much in his lecturing, but this is mostly because that is what his audience was interested in, especially the new-agers who desperately clung to Campbell in the last decades of his life.<BR>But I encourage those interested to dig deeper than this book into Campbell's work where can be found a rich, scholarly depth and breadth of mythos/logos study.	2001-09-26

I haven't read Toxic Sludge Is Good For You, but if this book expounds on things already expressed there then so much the better.<BR>Trust Us... reads like a very long &quot;60 Minutes&quot; news story.  I enjoyed it, especially the extent the authors went to expose the PR core out of the layers of bull that are deviously layed over it.<BR>It's a real eye and mind-opener.  It's too bad that there are not more books like this.  It is depressing how much power corporate PR has over the american mindset, and at the same time it galvanizes you to fight back.  Information, TRUTHFUL information, is power.	2001-09-06

The use of language and timing has always been Garrison's strong point, and this novel seems like an exercise in bringing everything he's learned over the years together.  It's a very speedy read for almost 300 pages with a breezy, carefree style and astute attention to what would be the primary interests of a yound teen boy in 1956.  Garrison's dry humor shines brightly in many passages.  Those who don't see what purpose the crude &quot;bathroom humor&quot; serves in this work haven't much vision.  As always with Garrison's work, he shines a light delicately through the paper-thin mask of religious fundalmentalism to show the anxious creatures underneath.	2001-09-06

Although this book is more comical and less deep than &quot;Widow For One Year&quot;, it still satisfies greatly.  As with most Irving novels, I couldn't put it down and read straight though in an evening. The typical Dickensian characters are all there.  The book is a bit more political than other Irving novels, but there's nothing wrong with that. I suspect this one will be compared much with &quot;Son of the Circus&quot;, especially with the few India scenes, but the writing is much more breezy and friendly in this novel.  I suspect this is what puts off reviewers as they seem to abhor any friendliness in writing.  But Irving being a master craftsman is able to pull it off and still paint a rich tapestry.  Again, this is a comparison to Dickens, but Irving certainly wouldn't mind.	2001-07-04

He then wrote How We Believe (one of my favorite books of all time), which went deeper into belief systems and how they work. Where the first book focused on the paranormal and pseudoscience end of the pendulum's arc, Borderlands... focuses on the other end:  science.   Shermer puts his money where his mouth is and applies what he's learned from How We Believe to scientific thinking.  While it is easy and fun to debunk all the whackos and kooks who believe in UFO's and the like, it takes greater courage to turn that same skeptical lens against the base you stand upon.  Science's critique of itself is what makes it closest to the truth.  Shermer shows that belief systems often encroach upon the scientific method and mess up the results. Shermer is today's scientific nietzschian.	2001-05-23

I have been waiting for years for a book like this to come along. It is truly a great read and gives tremendous skeptic treatment to the 'science' of psychology. For a long time I've considered myself a skeptic, but I have been on the fence as how to treat psychology--art or science? This book helped me to see it very clearly as science. Psychology has a long way to go to shed the soot of pseudoscience that has collected upon it in the last century, but if more people can cut through to the heart of the matter, like Stanovich has done, then the sooner it will emerge and bloom.	2001-02-05

I had to ask myself, why am I reading this book, and why would anyone read it?  I couldn't finish it because of 1) the atrocious writing and 2) it was all common sense!  It's like writing a book about the sky being blue.  This  book seems to serve no other purpose than to help Laura sell her Victorian  dogma.   Nevermind the hypocrisy of Laura writing this book and living a  wealthy life that doesn't have to deal with the constraints that the middle  and lower classes do, this book is a vague ideology of common sense blown  up so grandiose that it becomes a fairy tale.  If &quot;Dr.&quot; Laura  wants to live in &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, she's welcome to it.	2000-06-21

Jung, Mircea Eliade, and Joseph Campbell	Books	5	43	55	N	N	Wonderful debunker of running myths.	A refreshing read that gives the details about the lives and times of these three brillian men.  It helps to debunk all the soot that has accumulated upon their work from the burning fires of conservatives and the  religious right.  The attempts to tarnish their names with accusations of  anti-semitism and other prejudices fall flat in front of the facts.  This  book shows that people must deal with the political waves of their own  times, but it does not necessarily make them of the same dogmatic ilk.	1999-12-22

Not one for biographies I nevertheless enjoyed this one tremendously.  It is quite an intimate account of Campbell's life presented in an interesting format of his personal journal entries and recollections of others inbetween the Larsens' well written flow.  Who could not marvel at this man's brilliant life? The only problem with this biography is that in light of its length it loses a bit of the focus on Campbell's vision near the last few decades of his life.  The many anecdotes of friends he accumulated in the 70's and 80's are nice but I would've liked to have kept more with Campbell's journal entries (if he did indeed keep up with personal writings).  The last several chapters show Campbell living his life in the parasitic throes of 'new-agers', and portray them (unintentionally) as enjoying his company for their own benefit to the point where he probably was unable to get much of his own work done.  Of course, who could blame people for wanting to be near the man and hear his erudition?  But I would like to know more about his personal thoughts in his last years.   Joseph Campbell lived a truly enchanted life and will be the teacher for the next century in more ways than one.	1998-05-07

I heard this tale when I went to Indian Hills Elementary School in Gallup, NM in the early 70's. They showed it on one of the old filmstrips and I never forgot it.  This story has carried me through life, and only after a long, long search did I finally find it a few years ago in this book.  What a surprise to find Joseph Campbell involved with it, too!  The sandpaintings of Jeff King, interpreted by Maud Oakes, are phenomenal! This story is truly magical, steeped deeply in the enchanting god-country of the Navajo.  It was quite appropriately chosen as the first book of the Bollingen Series.	1998-05-07
