This fails to represent whatever were the true spheres of influence.<br />Repeatedly Menzies confuses cause &amp; effect. Many of the resultant journeys appear to be based upon the Chinese having prior knowledge of Ocean currents, eg in the Pacific the South Equatorial Current divides, going North to the Philippines and South to Australia. So apparently the fleet deliberately divides itself in 2 - but surely if they did divide, it was accidental, as the hitherto unknown Current flow caught them unawares? <br />They were swept up the Sacramento River from San Francisco Bay at the mercy of the prevailing winds, but then there is no explanation of how did they ever get back again to the open sea?<br />He waxes lyrical about the problems of measuring Longitude, but when he draws his own maps, such as those of the Chinese Island bases across the South Pacific, the maps aren't accurate, eg placing Easter Island some 3,000 miles west of its true position.<br />For a book with such a strong emphasis on geography, spoilt by some sloppy cartography.	2004-07-13

There is a more varied range of Product and Industry case studies, which helps to show how broadly this theory can be applied. <br />What I did like is how he covers the footnotes at the end of each Chapter - so if they don't interest you, you can skip over them, but if they do interest you, then you don't have to struggle to the back of the book. I wish more authors &amp; publishers would use that technique.<br />One quibble - given his Economics background, he suggests that having competing phone standards is not wasteful. Only an Economist would say that. A Consumer finds it frustrating. He has the good grace to suggest in a footnote that some readers might take issue with him, and I am one. He belittles the benefit of schoolgirls from Sweden using their phone on vacation in Spain, but I can vouch that being able to readily check on the safety of my teenage daughters when they're in foreign Countries for over 10% of the year is a definite benefit!<br />Given his Economics background - of course there are plenty of graphs, and 99% of them are straight lines - there are no time dependent variances in his world. Also some silly proof-reading slips, such as a &quot;semi-log&quot; graph being described as &quot;semi- long&quot;.<br />Probably still worth reading the Innovators Dilemma before reading this one, just to get the theory.	2004-07-13

There are 101 pages without a break for a chapter - is this an essay or a speech? Then we get a 54 page afterword - phew!<br />There are some good soundbites though, such as - the USA remains mired in history exercising power in a world where international rules and laws are unreliable, and where true security still depends upon the possession and use of military might.<br />I couldn't agree with the viewpoint that when the USA acts in its own interests, it necessarily serves the interests of everyone.<br />It accuses Europeans (read the French) that the risks from the &quot;axis of evil&quot; will never be as great as the risk from an American Leviathan unbound.<br />But I think it asks too much of the rest of the world, to trust in America, when America won't subject itself to any moderating influences, whether it be the UN or the International Courts.<br />A book aimed at educating the Europeans, but I'd rather have a seen a more balanced view to also re-educate the Americans.	2004-05-18

Certainly this was disappointing. It's not a conventional travelogue; in fact after 70 pages (25% of the book) she still hadn't got on the train!<br />Throughout she shows a brief insight into the personality of a dozen fellow passengers, but spends more time describing her problems gasping for a cigarette - hasn't she heard of nicotine patches? <br />In 8 lines (lines, not pages) she dismisses the whole journey from Portland Oregon to Sacramento to Denver to Albuquerque - and she doesn't even mention Nevada &amp; Utah. Was she asleep the whole time? Then Arizona to New York via New Orleans vanishes in a dozen pages with 2 anecdotes. Was she bored?

Based upon the publicity, I thought we'd get a pot pourri of examples of poor grammar in published material, but in fact there were few examples of this.<br />As it says on the flyleaf, this is indeed a book for people who love punctuation and get upset about it. <br />However, it can seem over-long in places. 33 pages on the Apostrophe was interesting, but 35 pages on the comma was exhausting &amp; exhaustive. The colon, semicolon, dash, brackets, ellipsis, italics, exclamation mark, question mark, hyphen &amp; emoticons all feature to good effect - but the ampersand was nowhere to be seen?<br />4* for the idea, and 3* for the result.<br />If you want to more readily know what to do when, I recommend the Style Guide from the Economist.	2004-04-12

Anyone in business should be already aware of the 80/20 rule - that 80% of your profits come from 20% of your customers. <br />This book goes that one step further - by some excellent case studies it shows how 150% of your profits come from 20% of your customers - they are the Angels. The Demons are those 20% of your customers who actually lose you money equal to 150% of your profit. <br />Its not another book about CRM (Customer Relationship Management), but it is about being Customer-focussed rather than Product-focussed.<br />I have multiple relationships with Companies who could do with reading this book - including my own employer, with whom I have around 20 Contracts, and yet any one Business Unit only seems to know about 1 or 2 others at best. All those lost selling opportunities - for example they know the ages of my kids from my Travel Insurance Policies, but have never tried to sell me any College Savings Plans!<br />Read the book and make your Angels happier - and get rid of the Demon ones!	2004-03-28

It was a very interesting read. <br />The only downside was that some of the chapters seemed too long, at over 30 pages? There were points when the topic of the chapter seemed exhausted, and was strung out, and on more than one occasion my interest waned, only to perk up on the next page when some new issue was introduced, and off we went again? <br />What I liked best was the little anecdotes, like how it took years for Canada to decide whether to drive on the Left or the Right, with British Columbia &amp; the Maritime Provinces not changing over until after the First World War, and then still over a number years between 1920 and 1924.

Some postings suggest they are describing the Hays translation, which this is not. <br />I picked up the Hays translation of this work, and phrases like 'junk' and 'if you keep putting things off' leapt out of the text. Consternation - did the Greek original actually have words like that? It was a 'modern translation - modern as in 'dumbing down'. <br />So I went looking for this Staniforth translation, only 40 years old, but more faithful to the original, as in 'think of your many years of procrastination' rather than 'if you keep putting things off'. I'm sorry, but if you can't handle good English, and need the 'dumber' versions, then you're probably too dumb to appreciate the finer points of the work in the first place.

I was once presented with a Business Plan for a Canadian subsidiary that projected to achieve 35% market penetration in 3-5 years.

According to my dictionary : one is an account of a life, the other is an account of past events - same thing?<br />In fact the first 4 chapters are a conventional history, from pre-Roman through to Early Middle Ages.<br />It's only thereafter that we get chapters on individual 'themes' that cover all ages, so you keep going back &amp; forth hundreds of years every few pages.<br />Unless you're a native/resident of London, you'll probably enjoy the book better if you have a London Tourist Guidebook to hand. There are a couple of Modern maps, but only of the City &amp; West End, so trying to understand what's being described outside the Roman City Walls is sometimes difficult. For example, why wouldn't a stranger think that Kentish Town is near Kent, ie to the South &amp; East, when in fact its to the North &amp; West? Also an Underground/Subway map might be useful.<br />Whilst there's descriptions of the transformation due to the docks &amp; the railways, there's no mention of air travel (whether it be from Croydon/Heathrow/Gatwick/City).<br />In fact it is interesting to note all the things that never get a mention : OK so the book is about London, but there's not a word about Queen Victoria (Winston Churchill gets a one-line quote). There's a picture of the Thames Flood Barrier on the front cover, but no mention of it in the chapter dedicated to flooding.<br />Plenty of pictures of London Bridge over the ages (and very nice they are too), but no pictures whatsoever of Big Ben or Houses of Parliament, Buckingham Palace or Trafalgar Square, Tower Bridge or Tower of London? <br />London is famous for its Museums &amp; Art Galleries, and it would have been interesting to read about their foundation. But apart from 3 mentions of the Tate Modern in the chapter on South Bank, that's your lot. No mention of even the existence of the British Museum, Natural History Museum, Science Museum,Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, Tate Gallery, National Gallery, Royal Academy etc etc  - surely there could have been 2-3 pages on those?<br />For all the talk about commerce and in which streets you could buy what goods, there's no mention of the foundation of larger emporia such as Harrods or Selfridges?<BR> <BR>So all in all, very pleased for what is to be found in there, but disappointed at what has been overlooked.	2004-01-25

Let me decide for myself if the book is any good - show me the product. Also, I work in IT, but there didn't seem to be a single reviewer with an IT background?<br />The book looks at the leader/manager/coach of a disparate group of professionals, assuming a mix of seniors &amp; juniors.<br />I think the book isn't just for the leader/manager/coach - because in many such groups today, there can be rotation (time-based or task-based) where any of the group of professionals might be called upon to perform the leadership / coaching / mentoring role. So the book should be read by all members of the team. Also the leader is human - they might not be 'doing it right as per the book', and it could be useful for the others (they are all equals after all) to be informed to provide that guidance/correction.<br />The Sections are laid out well : getting ready; coaching the individual; coaching the team; building for the future. <br />It classes individuals into 4 styles : amiable, analytical, driver, expressive (I tend more towards the expressive), and how to work with each. <br />I also like the way it addressed underperforming members, how to correct the problem rather than try to rationalise it out of existence.<br />Because professionals jealously guard their autonomy, reserving the right to work as they see fit, professional groups have a greater-than-average tendency to become ill-disciplined - and thus a whole chapter is dedicate to how to run a meeting of such individuals. <br />I work in such a group, where there are 20 of us, probably 50:50 seniors &amp; juniors (though we don't refer to ourselves in those terms). <br />Gripe no. 2 : However, one thing missing explicitly from the book is if there are any strengths, weaknesses, opportunities &amp; threats from a geographically disparate orculturally diverse group? <br />My group is spread across 2 continents, 5 different timezones, with only 2 hours in the day when our extended workday (8am-6pm) coincides. We comprise at least 5 different nationalities &amp; religions, and it seems many more political viewpoints. But time and time again, this material seemed to assume that this was a relatively homogeneous group, everyone was coming together physically in the same room, or at least, didn't even consider that people might be in the same geographical locations but be on the phone, and thus unable to see each others body language. My group only get together in the same room twice a year. We've evolved techniques over the 7 years we've been together to accommodate this, but I would have appreciated it more if this modern reality had been addressed? <br />I also liked the discussion on the maximum size of the group, and one correspondents rule of thumb that the group is too big if he can't tell you the name of everyone's spouse/significant other &amp; what that person does for a living (assuming its OK culturally to ask for that information - in some cultures it's a no-no).<br />There's an excellent wrap-up where the dozens of checklist (don't let the apparent volume put you off - it's not that bad) are summarised and classified, and you are reminded in which chapters they are to be found.<br />Overall I think my group is doing quite well 80% of what is in the book, with maybe 10% that we wouldn't agree with, leaving us 10% that we could improve upon. I'm going to recommend it to everyone else.	2004-01-22

For me, the consecutively-placed entries on Betrayal, Loyalty &amp; Blame were exemplary juxtapositions of those complementary topics.<br />I would also recommend the entry on Racism.<br />Given the brevity of the articles, sure they can't give you an in-depth discussion on the topic, but its just deep enough to get one thinking about the topics.<br />I think this would be an excellent 'pocket-book' to dip into for anyone in their late teens trying to come to terms with the world.<br />Having read this book, I moved directly to reading Graylings follow-up book, The Reason of Things.<br />Only disappointment - no Bibliography, so when Grayling frequently quotes other Authors / Philosophers, I don't know where to go to for further reading.	2004-01-22

However its all observation based upon hindsight of 'what' happened, with no real revelations into 'why'.<br />The selections are not convincing. <br />There's plenty of reference to Asahi Breweries in Japan who literally bet the whole Company on one idea about creating a market for Dry Beer. It paid off, but such a venture was very dangerous. Other Companies are studied that also bet everything yet didn't pay off; but there's no real insight into why the outcomes were different. <br />The index is poor; many Companies mentioned in the text don't appear in the Index. Compaq appears indexed under both 'failed transformations' and 'successful transformations' - so I re-read the relevant pages. It's the same anecdote, simply saying that what they did was a success 1991-98, but then caused their failing post-98? So what should they have done? If following the same action is deemed a 'fail' over 10 years, is it appropriate to still call it a 'success' over 8 years?  <br />It's a history lesson, but with no real tools &amp; techniques to take away for the future.	2004-01-21

This book is really a discussion about what actions have been taken post 9/11, and in parts it's a criticism of the overreaction that there has been.<br />However, its not overtly political, and gives dozens (perhaps a 100) practical worked examples of good &amp; bad, effective &amp; ineffective, responses to security issues, whether it be physical, electronic etc.<br />There is a 5-step process which I found useful to apply to everyday situations; and (in highly abbreviated form) these are : what are you trying to protect; what are the risks; risk mitigation; risks caused by the solution; trade-offs  <br />The core message is : &quot;as both individuals and a society, we can make choices about our security&quot;, and this book helps you understand how to make those informed decisions.	2004-01-21

I only recognised 20% of the names. Hardly had I thought this then the Introduction told me exactly who they were - very timely.<br />However, as I progressed through the book, there was quite a variance in the quality of the writing. Some authors, such as those on Cosmology, communicated well, but then others were far too high-level for a general audience. It was the latter chapters that brought me considerable delight &amp; education when discussing the Mind, Psychology etc (not my favourite subjects I may add).<br />If all the contributors had tuned their work to the same general audience, then this would have deserved 5 stars; if it wasn't for the redeeming work by the psychologists &amp; neuroscientists I'd have probably rated the book as 3 stars.	2004-01-18

Seife seems to start throwing in anything he could think of that might remotely involve zero. Since 1 divide by 0 equals infinity, we started getting digressions about infinity. Some strange metaphysical musings started appearing, such as after describing the work of an Indian Mathematician, the chapter closed with &quot;God was found in infinity - and in zero&quot; -- huh?<br />Siefe was (overly) diligent in explaining the square root of -1 before introducing the concept of 'i'. However, he was less diligent (as in not at all) in introducing 'e' and 'pi', but that didn't stop him from simply stating one of Euler's discoveries that &quot;e raised to the power (i times pi) = -1&quot;. However for Siefe this wasn't good enough, because there's no zero - so he rephrased it as &quot;e raised to the power (i times pi) + 1 = 0&quot;. And he didn't share the proof, but simply stated the equation in vacuo, so to speak.<br />Similarly he then moved on to describe the Casimir effect (about the mutual attraction between 2 parallel plates in a vacuum). But this is a physical effect, not related to the history of the zero - but if a vacuum is a synonym for zero, then anything about vacuums is in scope. So we also move on to the speed of light, and works by Einstein &amp; Maxwell, without a zero in sight? <br />Finally in one of the appendices Siefe presents one of the more famous paradoxes which appears to prove that 1=0; but then he spoils it by extending the number theory to show that Winston Churchill was actually a Carrot (as in the vegetable)? A silly move which added nothing to the value of the exercise.	2004-01-03

Does it also contain the concept of 'three-sided'? The German word for 'triangle' is 'Dreieck', or 'three-cornered'.  Presumably, that concept includes 'three-angled', but, again, does it include 'three-sided'?<br />Formalism : Consider the equation 0=0. If you print this out, you cannot say that the equation says that the leftmost hunk of ink shaped like an oval is identical to the rightmost hunk of ink also shaped like an oval. Clearly, those are two different hunks of ink.	2004-01-01

Each page contains genuine hyphenated terms such as 'joint-stock' and 'Anglo-Saxon', but there are rogue hyphenations such as in 'chap-ter', 'Car-negie', 'custom-ers', 'Gas-kell', and you keep having to re-read them to see what they mean?

But his time at the Royal Mint, and his clashes with Huygens, Hooke, Leibniz etc are well covered.<br />The only disappointment for some readers might be that this is not an overtly scientific/mathematical biography - there are no formulae : so if you want to know that little more detail about Newton's discoveries, such as the Laws of Motion, Laws of Gravity, and Differential Calculus, you won't see any of that in here.

Certainly the latter sections on how to apply the 5 different styles at work, and the strengths &amp; weaknesses of teams who find themselves with &amp; without all these players, were of more use than the theorising.<br />There are other books offering rival schemas, but I think this one is as good as any of the others, and easier to read.	2003-12-27

I was accustomed to having to wait hours, and more typically days, to speak to my manager - by which time the matter had either gone away or I'd sorted it myself anyway.<br />Then when I was in my 40's I found myself in the position that I could be a One-Minute Manager myself, and worklife became fun. So now I find myself re-reading the One-Minute Manager series with a new perspective on worklife.<br />Now, why did they write this one on &quot;Apology&quot; - did the concept begin before or after the latest round of scandals in US business? Either way, it is trying to set a new moral high tone for those CEO's etc who have become as arrogant as the Roman Emperors of 2,000 years ago? <br />This little book provides the antidote - but unfortunately can't force such people to recognise that they have made a mistake in the first place, and owe an apology. No book can do that. Only the Board, Stockholders and the Legal system - but the latter tends to constrain them not to say 'Sorry' to anyone! <br />Oh, and it applies just as well to your personal/family life!	2003-12-27

His rationale is that it 'may have hurt local dairy farmers but it also meant that poor children could get milk more cheaply'. Now I think that's bad. What about the poor(er) children of the dairy farmers themselves? Why ship US milk 2,000 miles from Wisconsin to Jamaica - not as if that market penetration would make any difference to Wisconsin's economy. And how much fuel &amp; energy are consumed in transporting all that milk, and how fresh is it when it gets there? My (UK) milk supply comes from a dairy less than 10 miles away. So now a poor economy like Jamaica isn't self-sufficient in a basic foodstuff? We get Stilgitz saying that was a good thing in 1992, but that lots of similar events since then are not? <br />I'm no fan of the IMF or the World Bank, but I don't buy his argument that everything is the fault of the IMF.

How to Use Everyday Ingenuity to Solve Problems Big and Small	Books	3	11	15	N	N	Easy to read � the enthusiasm is infectious	This is very well-researched - a collection of anecdotes of innovative products and processes from around the world - UK, Australia, Italy, France, Canada, Germany, Sweden etc - whether they be financial, medical, transport etc.<br />However, it's probably only of real use to a US Audience - comparing the US processes to the best foreign innovators. Everything they describe was already familiar to me (as I've worked in over 30 Countries).<br />Where they talk about localised innovation, such as Lojack versus the Club, its well written - but if you'd never been to the USA and seen adverts for either Product, it'd be very hard to appreciate what they were comparing. <br />I do like the US practice of being allowed to turn right on a red light - I wish we had that in the UK (obviously on a left turn for us), but this book taught me that it came from California originally. I think turn right on red is the best thing to come out of California since the Beach Boys.<br />Also, for its dozens of ideas, the book has no Index - so impossible to dip back into for that great idea.<br />In essence, the book is just a collection of anecdotes such as what imaginative people have been doing for 100's of years since Marco Polo and before - travel with your eyes, ears &amp; mind open, and observe how others have approached that problem that is so irritating back home.   <br />For example, if I was writing the equivalent of this book for a UK audience, I'd be pushing for 'turn on red', and to clone the USA's 529 College Tuition Savings Plans.	2003-12-05

It really has little or no street-credibility outside the USA.<br />I've worked for a US Fortune500 Company for 20 years, and in over 30 Countries.<br />The book confesses upfront to its limitations : although the information is US-centric, Williams, Clifton & Thomas believe their concepts are universal - but they haven't the experience to back that up. They admit they don't know whether current observations will hold up in different cultures, or whether different cultures have different profiles with respect to the lenses. The initial research has focussed on race, culture, nationality & ethnicity. In practice 90% of its focus is on race & ethnicity. Sexual orientation is ignored, and the word 'gay' doesn't appear until over 80% of the way through the book - and its only for one sentence.<br />Consider some of the Lenses :<br />For the Assimilationist they talk about \\"adapting US business norms appropriately, given global norms and standards\\" - well I've never met a \\"Global norm\\" - and as for being able to adapt US norms, there's the problem - you have to reject US norms in order to get on with the outside world. The Assimilationist must think about \\"Western cultural arrogance\\" - woah - what about \\"US Cultural arrogance\\" - ask a Canadian or a Mexican or the French how they feel about US hegemony.<br />The Culturalcentrist talks about the \\"Irish, Polish & Italian Communities\\", and in the same breath about the \\"Asian  Community\\" - I'm sure the \\"Asians\\" would argue they had less in common between India, Vietnam, Korea etc than those Europeans, who at least had Catholicism in common.<br />For the Seclusionist : \\"Globalisation ... diminishes the authority of the USA\\" - hmm, I thought everyone was rioting recently complaining that Globalisation meant US hegemony? The Seclusionist \\"rewards the efforts of the majority group\\" - oh so Williams has never thought ofa Society where the dominant group is itself a Minority, such as in Apartheid-era South Africa, and a number of other inequitable Societies today?<br /><br />The Transcendant options were just not for me - according to Williams you are either 'Religious' or you are 'Spiritual' - nothing else applies. I am neither, and quite happy thank you. I'm always made to feel uncomfortable with this aspect of US Society, and it would be good if Williams had a section on how to work with 'agnostics'.<br />The Elitist offered no alternatives - what about Communism or Socialism - the inequalities of US Society would not be tolerated in Scandinavia. As I say to my friends in Minneapolis, it's a pity the wrong shipload of explorers colonised North America.<br />For all the talk about race, there's no mention of working with people in mixed-race relationships or of mixed-race ethnicity - over 10% of marriages in the UK are mixed-race, even though the ethnic minorities constitute less than 8% of the population. I find mixed-race marriages in the USA to be a tragic rarity - and why aren't they promoted in TV programs?<br />There were no examples of other diversities which can be just as sensitive in Society, such as no case studies featuring Native Americans, Hindus, Moslems, Lesbians, Vegetarians or people with Physical/Mental disabilities.<br />The much-promoted mystical Chapter on the Eleventh Lens was a real disappointment - just some new world 'Nirvana' where everyone loved each other and did right by each other (I presume so long as you could still hire & fire at will).<br />When I looked through the Bibliography, I understood; of the 86 references, only 2 of them weren't published in the USA, and they were published in London (both looking back at the USA). You can't write a book about a Multicultural world if you don't read/travel widely.<br />Williams continually refers back to Title VII of the (US) Civil Rights Act (pity he didn't include it as an Appendix). It would have been nice to talk about the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights - since so much of US Society doesn't comply with it. I recall when one of our Senior US Executives starting to spout about Affirmative Action etc at a staff meeting in Germany - he had to be told to leave or they'd call the Police - because his US-speak was illegal under anti-Nazi legislation.<br />I scored myself on the Lenses : I am Colorblind, an Integrationalist, Meritocratist and a Multiculturalist.  Williams was (in 2001) inviting Contributors to help them develop the book for a wider audience - I'm going to volunteer to help them, because boy do they need it.	2003-12-03

What about the Bible, or many other blockbusters? Or is it just a (as in one of many) best-seller?

The cover doesn't say where he got his experience, so you don't get warned its about the advertising industry.<br />But the best thing was right at the end, &quot;Life's Creative Circle&quot; showing the stages of life from 0-100, eg <BR>30-40 = 'hell bent on success', <BR>40-45 = 'repeating success', <BR>45-50 = 'trying to keep up with the 25-year-olds', <BR>50-60 = 'reinventing yourself'. <BR>Not everyone would agree with all the descriptions, such as 75-85 = 'youth regained', as that's not quite the case for the 50%+ of the population who don't live that long, but it gives some ideas.<br />The book is cheap, but if it was $5 more it wouldn't be worth it.	2003-11-05

I regularly work in the USA, and when I mentioned this book to 10 or so US colleagues over dinner in Minneapolis, only 1 person had heard of it, which exemplifies the fact that Middle Class America have little consciousness of the realities of the 'slaving classes'. <BR>This book does not go into a detailed damnation of the 'system' in the way that 'No Logo' does, but it offers well-written personal recollections of times spent in 3 locations, Florida, Maine &amp; Minneapolis (hence why I asked my dinner companions if they'd heard of it). <BR>Even though I consider myself 'socially aware' it gave me further insight into the circumstances of those around me in hotels &amp; restaurants, and reconfirmed my already low opinion of the inequalities in US society. <BR>I believe that the US Federal Minimum Wage is $5.15, and hasn't been changed for 6 years (ie since 1997)?; contrast that with the UK Minimum Wage which has been increased every year since its introduction, even if only by 10p/15c per hour, and this last month (October 2003) went up by 7% (30p/50c per hour) to around $7.50.<BR>We also have a legal minimum of 20 days Vacation per annum (with 30 being more typical), max working week of 48 hours (with 35-40 being more typical), Sick Leave of 28 weeks (yes weeks, not days) per annum, with a minimum of $20 per day Sick Pay, and in case you think this generosity wrecks the economy, we have a Lower rate of Unemployment than the USA, and also a Lower rate of Inflation than the USA.	2003-10-30

At first I was disappointed - the most beautiful equation in the world, e^i.pi = -1, was missing! As I read the book, I looked back at the title : great equations of Modern Science, not of Modern Mathematics. And indeed that is what the book is. <BR>However I do have a few criticisms : <BR>I knew by reputation only 2 of the 12 authors - who were the other people? Long after I had searched out their biographies on the web, I found them at the front of the book - but before the title page rather than after - how strange to put them there, or not at the back of the book ? <BR>I didn't think the Drake equation was that `great' - and in Oliver Morton's chapter he places the Arecibo Radio Telescope in Costa Rica when in fact its in Puerto Rico. <BR>In the opening chapter, Graham Farmelo briefly alludes to `British Astronomers announcing their results' without explaining what it was they were looking for and what they found? Only in the later chapters by Peter Galison &amp; Roger Penrose respectively do they take pains to explain that Sir Arthur Eddington measured the bending of starlight during an eclipse. <BR>I was confused in the chapter on Schrodingers Wave Equation - it didn't describe the form I was familiar with. Then in the notes at the end of the book Arthur Miller explained the more general form - and confessed that the `time' element had been ignored - rather a strange omission in my opinion. <BR>Shannons Equations &amp; the Logistic Map were both new to me - and very interesting they were.	2003-10-30

He is undoubtedly one of the most informative writers on this topic, which certainly should be giving great cause for concern.<BR>I would strongly recommend the other 2 books : The Hot Zone is a non-fictional account about Ebola; the 2nd the Cobra Event is a novel, all the more effective for the background knowledge he had acquired.<BR>In this book Preston reverts back to the non-fiction genre to tell an upto date story about Anthrax (following the as yet unsolved incidents in the USA) and Smallpox (and the activities of the Russians in violation of International Treaty).<BR>There are other books available that had already discussed Anthrax or and/or Smallpox, so some of the material I already knew, but the section that was news to me, and thus more fascinating, was the description about the Smallpox outbreak at Meschede Hospital in Germany in 1970.<BR>If I have one criticism about Preston, it is that whilst he tries to show you the human side of what the participants were thinking at the time, he sometimes plays it to excess giving out superfluous information. This may be of use in a novel to create a sense of character, but in a non-fictional account, it isn't necessary. For example, instead of just saying he has lunch with one of his interviewees, you get the brand name of the beer that they drank (Molson). Elsewhere he describes meetings with others that they were drinking Glenmorangie &amp; Linkwood Malt Whisky - at least he saved us from saying how old the Whisky was, or whether or not they had water with it. <BR>Despite these Product Placement issues, he is an author to follow.	2003-10-30

I'd read Katzenbach's 'Wisdom of Teams' many years ago and really enjoyed it. But I didn't enjoy this book.<br />I wholeheartedly embrace the sentiments expressed on the flyleaf, such as &quot;pride in one's work ... and in the sense of accomplishment, camaraderie and emotional attachment that comes with it is the key to success ...&quot;<br />But what did I actually 'learn' from this book that I could take away and use, to change myself or to share with others? The answer is -- nothing. Contrary to the flyleaf, I found it neither &quot;inspirational&quot; nor &quot;practical&quot;, just 'light'.<br />Maybe the 19-page Introduction should have served as a warning, but there was just no substance to the book. If a College Student had turned this in as a paper, then I would have accused them of stringing together a number of disparate stories, but never once did it actually come to any conclusion as to 'why', 'what' or 'how'? <br />It just relies on the innate 'sensibility' that &quot;show me the money&quot; isn't the answer, but it didn't explain to me what 'is' the answer.	2003-10-29

It's a timely criticism of American Values, but it doesn't go far enough, because Bill is still a victim of his Culture.<br />When you open the book, you have to wade through no less than 33 advance reviews from other CEO's and Academics - this is overkill - just let me get at the book proper! Also this book was published in July 2003, and so it is ironic that one of those acclaiming 'authenticity' is the former CEO of the NYSE.<br />Bill has a few good words to say about having a Balanced Life, but the USA is still on a different planet.<br />On page 46 he rightly criticises those people who 'live for work', and do 80 hours per week; but then he praises those who work 50-60 hours per week, and who in his opinion have achieved 'a balance between their work and the needs of their families'. In my experience, the only way to see your kids weekdays as they are growing up, to read them a bedtime story or help them with their homework, is to try to never exceed 45 hours per week. Then on page 48 Bill talks more about the need for a Work-Life Balance, defining the problem, but then never discusses the solution. This 1-page is all you get, in a 200+ page self-help book?<br />All good stuff thereafter for the next 80 pages. <br />Then on pages 128-131 Bill describes an Ethical Challenge he experienced with a European subsidiary. No problems with what he did and why, but only with the principles he advocates in general. He was accused of being a typical American 'trying to impose American values on Europeans'. He's in favour of global principles, but only if they're on the American model - a true hegemonist. Bill is in favour of 'when in Rome...' just so long as the Romans are Americans. Americans should try to learn the opposite - to import European values. Anyone found consistently working more than 50 hours a week should be investigated - they can't be up to the job, or they are doing the job wrong - and that applies at all levels. <br />Bill never comments about the Minimum Wage, but since its now 'official' that if you're only paid the Minimum Wage you can't ever earn above the Poverty Level, it's a shame he doesn't discuss what he think about the ethics of that?<br />In closing, before any American Reader refutes my claims, let's just point out that the UK has (a) a higher Minimum Wage than the USA, (b) we work less Hours than the USA (48 hours max by law for most workers), (c) we have more Holidays/Vacation than the USA (20 days minimum by law, typically more than 30 days), and yet we have a lower Rate of Unemployment &amp; a Lower Rate of Inflation. The higher standard of living in the USA is based upon working excessively longer hours, and I'm afraid Bill isn't proposing to challenge that regime.	2003-10-28

I'd have liked to have seen more examples about small/middle-sized Companies.<br />The examples &amp; scenarios quoted all refer to Large US Corporations like AOL TimeWarner, AT&amp;T, EDS, GE, GM, IBM, McKinsey, Microsoft, Xerox. There's one fleeting reference (page 187) when non-US firms like Nokia, Shell &amp; Toyota get a 1-sentence 'also' mention.<br />The authors' Employer, SpencerStuart, gets plenty of promotion on the front cover as well as throughout the contents, and is described therein as &quot;the worlds most influential executive search firm&quot;. The authors say that they interviewed &quot;thousands&quot; of Executives.  I was therefore surprised and disappointed that they hadn't managed to cite a single example of a European or Asian Executive or Company? I can't believe that &quot;success&quot; is limited to American Executives or Companies? It even made me wonder how good the authors would be in performing an Executive Search for a European or Asian Company? Yet SpencerStuart has more Offices in Europe that in the whole of North America, so the absence didn't seem quite right to me?	2003-10-26

In conclusion, I think the comments on the back page say it all &quot;provides a good grounding&quot; - I'd rate it 'average to good' - but certainly not `excellent'.<BR>What lets it down are the pitiful worked examples. They are key to explaining the concepts, but the choices are terrible. They focus on Inventory Control, but I wonder if the author has ever done any real analysis in this arena? <BR>In Chapter 4 a few examples are introduced, that reappear throughout the book, for example : <BR>(a) &quot;Suppliers S1 and S4 are always in the same City&quot; - and this is reaffirmed as 'being not all unrealistic'<BR>(b) &quot;Suppliers in Athens can move only to London or Paris&quot;<BR>(c) &quot;Average shipment quantities never decrease&quot;<BR>but in my 25 years experience in systems design I could never imagine these rules as being acceptable in their own right, never mind as 'classics' to be used in training/education?<BR>When one finds poor examples like this, it always make me wonder whether there's other topics in the book that in my naivety I am accepting hook, line &amp; sinker, and others readers more familiar than me would similarly find to be in error? I suppose I'll never know. So I still need to read further about the topic in case I've been misinformed; so if you're going to buy one book about business rules - then this isn't the one.	2002-07-28

I regularly work in the USA, and when I mentioned this book to 10 or so US colleagues over dinner in Minneapolis last week, only 1 person had heard of it, which exemplifies the fact that the Middle Class America have little consciousness of the realities of the 'slaving classes'. This book does not go into a detailed damnation of the 'system' in the way that 'No Logo' does, but it offers well-written personal recollections of times spent in 3 locations, Florida, Maine & Minneapolis (hence why I asked my dinner companions if they'd heard of it). Even though I consider myself 'socially aware' it gave me further insight into the circumstances of those around me in hotels & restaurants, and reconfirmed my already low opinion of the inequalities in US society. I agree with other reviewers that it wasn't the greatest read, and lacked impact. I noticed that the US Minimum Wage is $5.15, and hasn't been changed for 5 years (ie since 1997)	2002-07-13

Did the compiler of the index actually 'read' the book?<BR>The remark on page 48 as to how m-commerce 'permits mothers to breast-feed their babies on time and at work' still mystifies me - wouldn't an alarm on a wrist watch or PDA do the same? <BR>There is a 7-line mention (page 67) of the potential health issues associated with cellphone radiation, but the descriptions are very poor, for example 'damage to genes in blood cells', 'weaken the blood-brain barrier' and 'cause unknown genetic changes'...	2002-01-07
