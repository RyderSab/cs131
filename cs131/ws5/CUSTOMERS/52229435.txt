As other reviewers have suggested, it presents large and small ethical dilemmas for its protagonist to puzzle over. But in the end, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that the protagonist's actions were as much motivated by revenge as by some kind of pure ethical principles, however much he might protest.<br /><br />Van Cassius Albert is from the Taran Republic and serves competently, if controversially, in its space navy. After he succeeds where he was supposed to fail, repeatedly disrupting his government's plans, he is retired from the service. When he is unable to find other work, he is rescued from mysterious assassins and winds up employed by Trystin Desoll, the near-immortal protagonist from \\"The Parafaith War.\\" It's obvious to everyone but our ethically striving but dense protagonist that he is being groomed by Desoll to take over, and that the Tarans as well as the religious, zealot Revenants are Bad Guys, if in different ways.<br /><br />You will have to decide for yourself if Desoll and Albert are ethical, or rationalizing fascists. Desoll, in \\"The Parafaith War,\\" at least attempted persuasion from within before taking the more . . . drastic . . . measures here. Albert doesn't. The Taran Empire brutally killed most of the people Albert had known. How much of Albert's actions are driven by a personal need for revenge? Was Hiroshima justified? These are not new questions.<br /><br />In some ways, this novel left the same sour taste in my mouth that Peter Hamilton's \\"Fallen Dragon\\" did: the conclusion is that selfishness and selfish choices can solve humanity's fundamental flaws. I think the Farkhans may share my opinion. You'll have to decide for yourself.<br /><br />Good but not great. As much annoying as throught-provoking. Bonus points for Albert's amazing family.	2005-10-10

After all, this is the writer who in \\"Guards, Guards!\\" described Critters who devour good writing and excrete thin volumes of literary criticism. Even the dullest critic can see the special perils of attempting literary criticism of a brilliant satirist and parodist.<br /><br />But Pratchett is an author who needs serious study. With something over forty books written now, some three-quarters of them set on the Discworld, and perennial high placement on the London Times best seller lists, this is an author who has had amazing success. Those of us who have read Pratchett's work know him to be an outstanding writer. He merits serious scholarship. Even at the risk of being a target of serious irony.<br /><br />This series of essays is a first attempt at that difficult task. The level of analysis and understanding is uneven, but all the pieces are thoughtful and thought-provoking. I especially recommend Farah Mendelsohn's essay, \\"Faith and Ethics,\\" which takes on the most challenging aspects of Pratchett's themes with skill and insight. Only a few of the essays fall into the intellectual trap of forcing Pratchett into some pre-conceived philosophical framework. Many of the essayists recognize that Pratchett is very nearly unique in his world view, and don't attempt to lash him to something he doesn't fit, chopping off the inconvenient bits. And all of the essays avoid the most obvious trap in analyzing Pratchett: stringing together your favorite scenes from your favorite books. There are quotes and references, but they are used for a purpose.<br /><br />You don't have to read these essays to enjoy, appreciate or understand Pratchett. But good literary criticism can increase that enjoyment, appreciation and understanding. By that standard, the essays here are good, if uneven. Recommended to those who have read Pratchett and appreciate fresh insights; probably not a good starting point to those unfamiliar with his books.ng point to those unfamiliar with his books.	2005-09-08

From a laugh out loud first few pages you are plunged into nightmare and horror through to a purely satisfying ending. In decades of reading fantasy I know of no story that better illustrates the form. Something different than Tolkien's idealized fairy-tale, and something better than mere horror, this is a superb book.<br /><br />Prospero - and not the one you are thinking of, either - and Roger Bacon must solve the riddle of an unreadable book before that riddle and a more powerful wizard kills them. The threat is all the more real because neither you nor the characters understand it; we understand the side effects well enough. But Bellairs lets you guess what might happen unless Prospero and Bacon act. Nameless horrors can be the most frightening of all.<br /><br />Bellairs died far too young, leaving only a handful of children's books, outlines for a few more and this tale. We can only wish there were more.<br /><br />Originally published in paperback by Ace in 1969, that early edition was brilliantly illustrated by Marilyn Fitschen. Her perfectly apt, child-like illustrations didn't make it to this new hardbound edition, so you miss the macabre heraldic device of Melichus, and the spooky illustrations of Bellairs' scenes. It's a loss only partially made up for by the fine Anton Pieck cover drawing, completely appropriate to the story's secret. The paperback was printed, unhappily, on typical Ace cheap paper, and is now browned and brittle. Finding it isn't easy and may no longer be worth the effort.<br /><br />Still, despite the missing drawings, it is wonderful to have The Face in the Frost back in print. This should be on your short list of the best fantasy stories written. It's a story you will read again and again Highly recommended; simply superb.	2005-08-02

The plot, such as it is, has the protagonists discover that their invention travels through the worlds of various novels, through universes of fiction. They can explore and have adventures in the worlds of those novels. They play anagrams with Rev. Charles Dodgson. Okay, that's an interesting idea. It owes something to a lot of authors, including John Myers Myers' \\"Silverlock,\\" but it's a neat idea.<br /><br />But when the protagonists stumble into the fictious universe of one Robert Anson Heinlein, the story falls off the shelf into a jumble of narcissism  and solipsism. In the last chapter, matters get still worse with not just characters from Heinlein's Lazarus Long story track but characters from essentially all of Heinelin's storylines strolling through to exchange greetings and in-jokes with the protagonists. The irony here is that Heinlein's mockery of solipsism in his earlier books - like \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" - was exactly right.<br /><br />Unhappily, Heinlein became infatuated with this plot device, and used it in two more books. They are not quite as self-indulgent as \\"Number,\\" but the creativity that characterized Heinlein's earlier writing is gone.<br /><br />Perhaps this is a problem with older science fiction writers? Certainly Larry Niven has fallen into recycling old characters, ideas and tropes in recent books. See, for example, \\"Ringworld's Children.\\" Let's call if \\"SF Codger Disease.\\" Well, in \\"Number\\" Robert Heinlein wallows in the symptoms, and it is neither clever nor a pretty sight. Make this one of the last Heinlein books you read...	2005-07-13

The contents range from \\"The Hades Business,\\" Pratchett's very, very first work, through \\"Incubust,\\" his hysterical and masterful 100 word contribution to the Drabble Project. Along the way you can find gems like \\"Troll Bridge,\\" \\"The Sea and Little Fishes\\" and \\"Theater of Cruelty,\\" set in the Discworld, and, of course, the half-infamous, half-legendary short story, \\"Hollywood Chickens.\\"<br /><br />As the title suggests, most of the stuff collected here has been published earlier elsewhere. From the droll introduction to the new edition of \\"Brewer's\\" to the sad and thoughtful, \\"Orangutans Are Dying,\\" the full spectrum of Pratchett's writing is laid out. If you don't know or like Pratchett, you are not likely to enjoy this book. But if you are a fan of Pratchett - and I am an unabashed fan - there are genuine joys in seeing a collection of writings spanning 30 years or more, all in one volume.<br /><br />The collection was first published to  in 2004 to mark the event of Terry being Guest of Honour (note British spelling) at Noreascon Four, the 62nd World Science Fiction Convention. It's good to see it in wider distribution. No serious Pratchett fan should be without it.	2005-07-12

Let me explain.<br /><br />This a Pratchett short story involving the wizards and Unseen University. It seems that in an earlier Science of the Discworld book one of the wizards - the Dean of UU, in fact - accidentally created Roundworld, our universe, which is about a foot across on the outside but infinite on the inside. With the aid of Hex, UU's supercomputer (and a familiar character to Discworld readers) the UU faculty stave off disaster in Roundworld. This time, it seems that Darwin has gone and written the wrong book, \\"Theology of Species\\" instead of \\"Origin of Species.\\"  An excellent premise, with lots of opportunity for Pratchett to have his usual fun with both sides of the Creationism/Evolution debate.<br /><br />But what you get are alternating chapters of Pratchett and his short story, laced with longer chapters by Stewart and Cohen (no relation to the Barbarian) talking about a Roundworld science topic that has popped up in the short story. The result is a chopped up short story and somewhat tedious popular treatments of science subjects. Make that shallow, tedious popular treatments.<br /><br />Part of the problem is that Pratchett is a genuinely brilliant writer, possessed of a wonderful imagination and wicked sense of humor. Stewart and Cohen are new to me, and I read a lot of science, but their writing, their imaginations and their sense of humor suffer badly by comparison. It's not all their fault. I wouldn't want their job if it were Swift or Twain doing the writing either. But at the same time Stewart and Cohen are guilty of trying to do too much and too little with their chapters. Too much, in that they attempt to cover too many very complex science subjects; too little in that they write superficially and, sometimes, inaccurately, about their subjects.<br /><br />I admire the effort. If wrapping science in Discworld magic will help science education, even a little, it is well worth the effort.<br /><br />On a side note, I hope that SOD III isn't \\"canon\\" in the regular Discworld series. Hex's near-omnipotence in SOD III is troubling and, to the extent it is science, could have used a little bit of analysis by Stewart and Cohen as well.<br /><br />There's better Pratchett - although this might not be bad if you just read his chapters - and there's better science popularization. The synergy from the two together almost, but not quite, works. Okay, but not great.ittle, it is well worth the effort.  <br /> <br />On a side note, I hope that SOD III isn't \\"canon\\" in the regular Discworld series.

In \\"Mammoth,\\" Varley follows in the footsteps of both Robert Heinlein - notably, \\"All You Zombies\\" - and Terry Pratchett's \\"Strata.\\" It's still a rich field, but the footprints of your predecessors are always in sight.<br /><br />Multi-billionaire Howard Christian wants to clone a mammoth. His expedition to the Canadian Arctic yields a mammoth carcass, all right, but even more surprising is the frozen man alongside, wearing a wrist watch and clutching a metal briefcase. The briefcase may or may not be a time machine. Christian, a brilliant inventor in his own right, hires young physics genius Matt Wright to create a functional time machine. Wright falls for young elephant vet and would-be mammoth trainer Susan Morgan. All of those geniuses and no one stops to wonder about who the corpsicle might be. Until it is too late.<br /><br />Varley is a very good writer. He deftly changes the reader's perception of Howard Christian over the course of the novel. By the time we see Christian lurking in his armed fortress, 200 stories over the streets of Los Angeles, armed with a gigawatt laser; well, I certainly knew who might not be the good guy, benevolent billionaire after all.<br /><br />My own opinion is that beginning with \\"Red Thunder\\" - or perhaps even \\"The Golden Globe\\" - Varley has consciously set up to do homages to Heinlein's juvenile science fiction novels of the 1950's. Varely's last two or three books are uncannily similar in tone, if not plot and characterization, to stories like \\"Red Planet\\" and \\"Rocket Ship Galileo.\\" While Pratchett may have mercilessly parodied the \\"artifact from the future\\" - along with most other science fiction tropes - in \\"Strata,\\" Varley demonstrates there are good yarns left in the themes Heinlein explored half a century or more ago.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed another Heinlein reference - \\"The Man Who Travelled in Elephants\\" - to which Varley gives the sly wink. A lot of references in \\"Mammoth\\" will Reward the Careful Reader.<br /><br />This isn't the wildly imaginative John Varley of the Gaea trilogy, but read as a tribute or homage to other, earlier writers, this novel is still fun. If you haven't read the earlier writers who have explored the ideas underlying \\"Mammoth,\\" this novel might be more exciting.

Not all readers know that \\"Ender's Game,\\" the first novel, started from a short story. That short story still remains arguably Card's best single piece of writing. But after four novels in the \\"Ender\\" arc, and now another four novels in the \\"Shadow\\" arc, as well as a few short stories along the way, Card and the Ender universe are starting to run out of gas.<br /><br />Card's first problem is that we know exactly how it is going to come out. Let's call this the Lucas Problem. Anyone who carefully read the first book knows what is going to happen. Card has to make the process interesting enough to hold our attention. He nearly succeeds, but is hampered by some other issues.<br /><br />Card's second problem is that he knocked off the arch-villain Achilles at the end of the previous book. Since E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith's \\"Skylark\\" series, thoughtful science fiction writers have known it's always a mistake to kill the bad guy early. \\"Giant\\" misses Achilles.<br /><br />Card's third problem is that the series' most compelling character, Ender - Andrew Wiggins, the protagonist of the first four books - has long since left the scene. The primary protagonist of the \\"Shadow\\" series, Julian \\"Bean\\" Delphiki - a minor character in \\"Ender's Game\\" - is still dying of the same disease we have known about from the start.<br /><br />So all that is left for readers is the problem described at the end of \\"Ender's Game\\" - a half a dozen or so teenage military geniuses loose on a deeply divided earth. As we watch them succumb, variously, to gene-meddling, megalomania, naivete and ennui, it turns out that the adults, the teachers, those same folks that trained Ender and the other children, had the solution all along. If I were a teenager reading \\"Giant,\\" I'd be seriously annoyed.<br /><br />Card is a good writer. He has also shown some terrific creativity in earlier books in the series, especially in \\"Speaker for the Dead.\\" But in this book he sometimes substitutes political opinion for creativity - let's call this the Heinlein Problem, or, if you like, the Goodkind Problem - and it doesn't work.<br /><br />The cumulative effect is that the book drags a bit, limps along a lot, and leaves you unsatisfied at the end. The Lucas Problem is there on every page. The Heinlein Problem annoys. Card can and has done much better. First time readers in Ender's universe will be completely bewildered and should not start here.<br /><br />The plot has a few loose ends; I'd guess Card has left himself narrative threads to pick up in the future. That's fine. Ender's Universe is an interesting place.

But it mostly Brust having fun. He wrote on his website, \\"I wrote it for the sheer joy of writing it--I giggled all the way through. No one was more surprised than me that, not only was it published, but a lot of other people seem to like it. Cool.\\" Cool, indeed.<br /><br />One of the conceits of the Khaavren Romances is that they are written by a contemporary of Khaavren, the protagonist, one Paarfi of Roundwood. Paarfi redefines \\"prolix\\" with each page he writes. Like Dumas, Paarfi is paid by the word. Like Dumas, Paarfi writes with hyperformality, wild circumlocutions, and a willingness to break from the narrative thread at any time to chase down almost any distraction. As just one example, at one important juncture Paarfi spends a few pages establishing that a long place name, de-constructed through half a dozen languages, translates as \\"wood wood wood wood.\\" It's a sly send-up of Dumas; Paarfi out does Dumas, to wonderful effect.<br /><br />At a time when fantasy literature has deteriorated to clich&eacute;s and worse, when authors like Diane Wynne Jones can write a \\"Tough Guide to Fantasyland\\" and skewer nine-tenths of the genre, it is a sheer delight to find a fantasy writer who can write, who loves to write and who can communicate that delight to his readers.<br /><br />Like Dumas' Musketeers, this story follows the careers of four young minor nobles, who come to the capital to enlist in the king's special regiment. Except that the setting is not France but rather Brust's Dragaera, the complex world of the Vlad Taltos series, set a millennium before Vlad Taltos. Remember, Draegarans live a very long time. Brust and Paarfi's world is more complex even than 17th century France. Brust as Paarfi revels in the complexities. Khaavren, the main protagonist, is very much d'Artagnan. But in other ways, including the heros' delightful rescue from execution near the end of the book, are Brust's own invention.<br /><br />This is not \\"sword and fur jockstrap,\\" slash and sizzle fantasy. There are no heaps of bodies. This is a recasting of a classic by a very fine author. If you know Dumas, it adds to the fun.

Easter Island and the Norwegian colony in Greenland; the more recent genocide in Rwanda. Small societies and more complex ones, ancient and modern, he tries to identify common threads.<br /><br />He also identifies societies with equally limited resources that have adapted to their environment and succeeded. Iceland, Papua New Guinea and Japan. He contrasts those successes with the failed societies to test his hypotheses.<br /><br />While many reviewers have characterized this book as the \\"flip-side\\" of \\"Guns, Germs and Steel,\\" I think it is more accurate to view it as an extension of that book, and examination of what happens to societies who start off with the conditions and natural resources that allow them to succeed, as those resources are consumed.<br /><br />Some reviewers - and I'm afraid I must question whether they have actually read the book - dismiss Diamond's hypotheses as \\"academic trash.\\" I think they do so at their peril. Diamond's observations and conclusions should give any thinking Westerner pause. It is inarguable that our present pattern of resource consumption is unsustainable, as Diamond demonstrates. The only issue is the consequences of that reality. In disturbing ways, those who blindly criticize this book demonstrate Diamond's point.<br /><br />Diamond has also been criticized for being simplistic. That's a criticism that is made of every science writer who attempts to write for a wider audience than academia. Diamond's intended audience is not prepared for von Thunen circles or Spenglerism. It is true that Diamond has simplified matters a bit, but that's significant only if Diamond, in his attempt to make his writing accessible, distorts the facts. I suggest that, for the most part, Diamond's explanations are accurate.<br /><br />I have a few minor quibbles: for example, he suggests that post-ice age hunters exterminated North America's megafauna. Recent research indicates that many of those species were in steep decline long before humankind arrived in North America, and that hunting, at most, accelerated their disappearance. But that's a quibble.<br /><br />Diamond describes himself as \\"cautiously optimistic about our society's ability to recognize the risks we are undertaking and to react correctly and in time. I am much more skeptical. Certainly the current U.S. government calls to mind the Greenland colony chieftains and the Easter Island tribal chiefs, who ignored the evidence of collapse all around them, and succeeded only in making sure they were the last to starve to death.<br /><br />This is a book of amazing scope. It is superbly written. It has frightening implications for anyone who can see beyond their own immediate self-gratification. It is folly to dismiss these ideas; it is dangerous to ignore them.

For those familiar with Modesitt's \\"Recluce\\" series, this is the 13th book and, like most of the 12th book, takes place on the islands of Austra and Nordla, away from the continent of Candar and the island of Recluce, where the 11 earlier books were set.<br /><br />Modessit really has only one story to tell. The plot in all 13 books is largely the same. The protagonist - always a male, by the way - must overcome increasingly difficult challenges to triumph. There have been three variations: in some of the middle books we learned that the White Demons, the Chaos wizards, had some good points. In some of the other books, we saw the origins of \\"The Legend,\\" the societies on this world where woman are dominant and not men, although always from the point of view of a man. And in \\"Wellspring\\" and in \\"Ordermaster,\\" we see the formula applied to a middle-aged barrel maker, rather than a callow youth.<br /><br />It really reminds me of the old 1960's Motown groups who are still touring, 40 years down the road, singing the same songs, using exactly the same dance moves. It's charming but not captivating. It's frustrating because you can see Modesitt's talent improving across the books, but he hasn't written a *new* book in years; just variations on the same book.<br /><br />And then there is The Balance. Modesitt's carefully rationalized magic, Order v. Chaos, requires that there be a balance, a concept developed throughout the series. At its simplest level, the Balance says that when there is a powerful order wizard like Kharl, the protagonist here, there has to be an equal increase in chaos. And we know from earlier books that Kharl has a equally powerful contemporary in Lerris, the protagonist of \\"Magic of Recluce\\" and \\"Death of Magic.\\" Where are the \\"super wizards of Chaos\\" to balance these two?<br /><br />In the last three or four books, the Empire of Hamor has been the baddy; perhaps in the next book we will see Kharl and Lerris team up to take down Hamor? No, what am I saying, that would be a new plot. Not likely.<br /><br />\\"Ordermaster\\" is a good yarn, but nothing new; it's a story told thirteen times.

Sibley and Kauffman have both published very good guides recently, serious competition for the venerable National Geographic guide. National Geographic has responded with this, the 4th Edition, which has almost all of the new names, new splits and new species. How to decide among the competitors for the guide to take into the field?<br /><br />First, you can't go wrong with any of the three. They are all very good, although each brings different strengths and weaknesses.<br /><br />Second, if you bird with a companion, carry different guides: one of you take National Geographic and one of you take Sibley or Kauffman.<br /><br />Third, measure your skill level against the assumptions of the various guides. If you are a novice, then Kauffman might be your best choice. If you are a beginner who has a bit of experience, then National Geo may be your best choice. If you are an advanced beginner or better, then perhaps Sibley.<br /><br />But as an overall choice, with decent art (although not quite as good or as consistent as Sibley), decent identification highlights (although not quite as good as Kauffman), quite good behavior cues, excellent treatment of vagrant birds, pretty accurate range maps and highly readable text, National Geographic emerges as the most versatile of the three.<br /><br />If you can, get all three.

In no particular order, earlier books are \\"Expendable,\\" \\"Hunted,\\" \\"Vigilant,\\" \\"Trapped,\\" and \\"Ascending.\\" Technically, I suppose, the lamentable \\"Commitment Hour\\" should be included, but let's not.<br /><br />Not all of those books have focused on Explorers, so-called Expendable Crew Members, but they figure in most. ECMs, in Gardner's universe, have physical flaws. Youn Su, the protagonist of this novel, has an ulcer on her cheek; Festina Ramos, the character who links many of these six novels, has a portwine stain. In Gardner's universe, casualties among Explorers are less harmful to the morale of the rest of the crew because of those physical flaws. That's the premise, anyway.<br /><br />Another premise of Gardner's universe is that earth folk are very junior members of the League of Peoples. The senior members are omniscicent, omnipotent and omnipresent. As an example, the League defines \\"non-sentient\\" as someone who kills another. The senior members of the League punish \\"non-sentience\\" by killing non-sentients who venture into space.<br /><br />Other premises include human pheromones, glass-like, transparent humans, an utterly corrupt and incompetent earth government, evolution to higher levels by chemistry and mystic radiation, morbid and pathological fear of evolution to higher levels, and semi-intelligent nanotechnology.<br /><br />If you just lay it out like that, the premises read like a checklist of science fiction's silliest ideas. Shades of Kilgore Trout. Whatever else, you have to check your disbelief at the door when you read one of these books.<br /><br />But despite all of those silly premises and silly science, these books are a lot of fun to read. And in the last few, at least, there is something more than mere entertainment involved. In \\"Radiant,\\" for example, there is an interesting clash between Eastern - well, quasi-Buddhist - and Western action heros. Gardner does an effective job of contrast, although I could wish he had added Tut as a more fully-developed character; Tut is an semi-sane, trickster hero, a non-malevolent Loki. But Tut is mostly overshadowed.<br /><br />But what is most striking about Gardner across these six novels is how much his writing has improved. If you read or re-read \\"Expendable,\\" his first book, with \\"Radiant,\\" his most recent, the improvement is palpable. Language, dialog, description, characterization; all show very substantial improvement. Even the level of silly science is down a bit.<br /><br />So yes, I like this book, and I like Gardner. Good yarns, well told. I'd even recommend it. But it may be that Gardner as an increasingly sophisticated writer, is outgrowing the very unsophisticated premises that underpin this series.ner does an effective job of contrast, although I could wish he had added Tut as a more fully-developed character; Tut is an semi-sane, trickster hero, a non-malevolent Loki.

Or you can read it as a caper story, featuring two, perhaps three con men. But however you read it, this novel will please, delight and enthrall you. This is masterful, this is a master's work. It's time to recognize Pratchett as a great writer in the finest British tradition.<br /><br />The pseudonymous Alfred Spangler is dead, hung by neck to dance the rope fandango. But a very surprised Moist van Lipwig awakes in the Patrician's office. When offered the choice of becoming Postmaster of the dead-as-a-dinosaur Ankh-Morpork postal service or the right to leave the Patrician's office by the door behind him, the bright young con man accepts the duties of Postmaster. When running away doesn't work, Moist settles in to the challenge. To his surprise, running a big operation like the Post Office is a lot like running a con; to his greater surprise, he even starts to enjoy it.<br /><br />But the competition to the Postal Service - the Grand Trunk Clacks, a kind of Middle Ages internet - is run by Reacher Gilt, a one-eyed, black-haired chairman who has a parrot trained to call, \\"Twelve and a half percent.\\" Gilt takes competition to new extremes. Moist, who has always disdained violence, and Gilt, who will stop at nothing, engage in an escalating struggle. Moist can't seem to help himself, his reaction to a challenge is to up the stakes. And in a game of Find the Lady, no one is better than Moist.<br /><br />As a caper story, the setup is perfect. Pratchett shows you all the cups, and defies you to find the pea. It makes the ending immensely satisfying. As an indictment of the immorality of capitalism, the part that works best is your laughter. Nothing that takes itself so seriously, and is so self-important, can stand ridicule. Including Reacher Gilt.<br /><br />As in all Pratchett novels, there are very funny scenes, but the mature Pratchett uses humor for a purpose beyond entertainment. This is using the Discworld as a mirror to reveal the parts of our world we otherwise cannot or will not see. This is a superb book, nearly flawless, and a delight from beginning to end. Highly recommended.inment. This is using the Discworld as a mirror to reveal the parts of our world we otherwise cannot or will not see.

It's not. It's pure science fiction. And it is all recognizable science. Many of the characters in the stories think that there is magic involved. There isn't, but they don't know that. Understanding why that is so, and why some of the characters call themselves \\"Krue\\" is at least half the fun in reading these books.<br /><br />Clarke's Law says that any sufficiently advanced science is indistinguishable from magic. Kirstein's premise is that if a population is unaware of science, then all science is magic. Kirstein has invented an alien world still undergoing human terraforming. The general population is ignorant of all science and all but the most primitive technology. Those who do know science and technology are called wizards, and ruthlessly cut down challenges to their power.<br /><br />The protagonist, Rowan, is a Steerswoman, a member of a scholarly order that has re-invented logic. Rowan discovers puzzling \\"jewels,\\" integrated circuit and solar power chips, and in trying to reason out what they are and what they mean discovers terrifying threats to her world. Through the earlier stories she has had to avoid the efforts of the wizards to kill her, and in her efforts to understand the dangers, explored parts of her world that her people have never seen. But at no time does that exploration degenerate into a Larry Niven-like travelogue. This isn't wandering or touristry; Rowan is on the track of a deep mystery and her travels are purposeful and focused. But they give Kirstein the excuse to describe the world she has invented. And that world is fascinating and rigorously self-consistent.<br /><br />While there are sword fights and moments of very high tension, this is mostly a story of ideas and the joys of understanding. The most important moments aren't the battles; they are the moments when Rowan understands, reasons out and comprehends critical aspects of the problems her world faces. She has known since the second half of \\"The Steerswoman's Road\\" that she cannot fight her enemy with force; she must learn and comprehend.<br /><br />This is a story of ideas, exceptionally well-told. We get to revisit dangers and friends from the first book, and watch Rowan make considerable progress in her quest. Wonderful characterization, flawless plotting and considerable suspense, all told with flashes of humor and delightful surprises.<br /><br />Special thanks to Ms. Kirstein and her publisher for getting this sequel out so quickly on the heels of \\"The Lost Steerman.\\" And yes, I want my next desktop computer to be like Kieran's.<br /><br />Without spoilers, at the end of this story Rowan actually has a piece of the puzzle in front of us. But Rowan, because she lacks a context to understand what it means, cannot understand. Kirstein is a skilled enough writer that we don't either. But I can't wait to find out.<br /><br />If you are looking for swords and sorcery, try a different author. If you want an engrossing, enthralling and well-told adventure of ideas, this is the best there is.

There's also enough unresolved issues and mysteries - several of the bad guy Ifrits and Efrans are still on the loose - to leave room for sequels.<br /><br />But there are sour notes, too. And while this is, overall, the best book Modesitt has produced since the earliest Recluce novels, some of those sour notes detracted from my enjoyment of the book.<br /><br />Sure this is fantasy, and as long as we are fantasizing, we might as well have a perfect love interest, but the relationship between Alucius and Wendra is just too perfect. They never fight, quarrel or disagree. These two would be a lot more compelling if they and their relationship was just a little more real. Especially since Modesitt purely cannot write a sexually charged scene.<br /><br />The faint hints in \\"Darknesses\\" that Alucius might be at least partially a creation of the Soarers is never developed or explained. For me, there are faint echos of E.E. Smith's \\"Lensmen\\" series here. The prefix \\"a\\" means \\"in\\" and \\"lucius\\" means \\"light.\\" The first pages of \\"Darknesses\\" have the infant Alucius bathed in the Soarer's green-gold light. Tantalizing ideas. But we never find out.<br /><br />And then there is the \\"Superman effect.\\" What makes the comic book character Superman starkly incredible is that he is darn near all-powerful and yet he never is anything but selfless. He's never greedy, selfish or even faintly immoral. He may kill entire regiments of enemies but he fells bad about it afterwards, and anyway he has no choice if he is to save the world (or at least Lois Lane). Look, we *crucified* the last perfect human being, and there haven't been any since. In the last few chapters of this book, Alucius has powers that Superman would envy. And he doesn't abuse or misue them. Not once.<br /><br />In the somewhat similar Recluce series, the Wizard Lerris at least acts human from time to time; he can be stupid, short-sighted and blind to the obvious. Alucius isn't any of those things. He is immensely more powerful, and his power isn't constrained. Alucius is a much less interesting character as a result. Perfect and nearly omnipotent just isn't that interesting.<br /><br />Finally, the quasi-ecological theme of \\"Scepters\\" is just a little too heavy handed for me. If the Ifrits' and Efrans' life-destroying habits aren't a metaphor for our own culture, then I'm a Soarer. And the implication of \\"Scepters\\" - that it is all right to obliterate and extirpate the other guy if you are protecting your own ecology - might just be a little extreme. Analogy, in Heinlein's phrase, is \\"more slippery than logic,\\" but by analogy it is okay to annihilate that oil industry because of what it does to the environment. Sorry. The ends don't justify the means.<br /><br />The book is fun, it's well-paced and Talent is an interesting idea. The book is a nice wrap to the trilogy. But it's not Moedesitt's best book. Readers new to the series should read the books in order.<br /><br />Good, but not great.Not once. <br /> <br />In the somewhat similar Recluce series, the Wizard Lerris at least acts human from time to time; he can be stupid, short-sighted and blind to the obvious.

US	52229435	RUPS0GMF3MOU0	0765301679	411086011	Ringworld's Children	Books	4	28	31	N	Y	A Suspension Bridge With No End Points	Larry Niven reported that engineering students have determined that the Ringworld mathematically is a suspension bridge with no end points. I don't have the math skills to confirm the claim, but I can confirm that enjoyable as the Ringworld series has been, sometimes when reading this fourth Ringworld book I felt like more than one kind of end point was being suspended.<br />This is the story of how Louis Wu's hand-picked successor to the Ringworld \\"throne\\" preserves the Ringworld from the threat of annihilation by human cops, kzinti warcats and other folk we thought we had learned to like. The ARM agents here, for example, aren't upset when their antimatter tools blast a Manhattan-sized hole in the floor of the Ringworld, jeopardizing the lives of the Ringworld's 30 trillion inhabitants. The ARMs we meet note they can still learn a lot studying the deserted, desiccated shell if that happens. It doesn't, of course, but Larry, you've sure come a long ways in your attitude towards cops since the days of Gil the Arm.<br />Like Robert Heinlein in his last half dozen books, Niven has also taken to recycling old ideas from earlier books, even ideas his characters rejected then, and using them in \\"Children\\":<br />  - Ship-eating monsters in hyperspace, rejected as a possibility in \\"Borderland of Sol,\\" may turn out to be real. (Beowulf Schaeffer was right and Carlos Wu was wrong? Who'd have thought it?) So Puppeteers are right to fear hyperspace.<br />  - Teela Brown's fabulous luck, discredited in \\"Ringworld Engineers,\\" may be a matter of lucky genes after all.<br />  - The anti-matter solar system in \\"Neutron Star\\" turns out to still be around.<br />  - The \\"Longshot,\\" the experimental advanced ship from \\"Neutron Star\\" and \\"Ringworld\\" turns out to still be around.<br />  - Schizophrenic cops, an idea from the one original story in \\"Crashlander,\\" appear again. (Larry, what is it about you and cops?)<br />  - Carlos Wu's fabulous autodoc, also from \\"Crashlander\\" or maybe from \\"Ringworld Engineers,\\" continues to play a starring role.<br />There are half a dozen other references from earlier works that I saw, and likely a lot more that I missed.<br />Niven's strong suit has always been ideas and the extrapolation of ideas, combined with good plotting. He's never been a strong character author, and he has the annoying habit of paying more attention to the scenery than to character development. That's an ongoing problem with this short novel, too. And an unusually large number of characters are abandoned by the author, having served there immediate function to the plot. (Larry, what was the purpose of having Louis Wu and his motely crew meet the Giraffe People? And that's Larry's pun, not mine.)<br />And spare me any more rishathra jokes. Please.<br />Niven continues to do one thing consistently well: Protectors, the folk who probably built the Ringworld, are mostly superintelligent, in addition to having some other skills. How can a writer of normal intelligence, writing to a reader of normal intelligence, portray believably a superintelligent being? It takes more than one technique. Niven uses several effectively, perhaps more effectively than he has done in the last two Ringworld books. It's the best and most effective aspect of this novel.<br />The motivation of Protectors is less well, or at least less consistently, developed. You knew - come one, admit it - that the Ringworld would have a surviving original Pak Protector. But how is that Proserpina is still alive? And why did Bram - the former occupant of the Ringworld \\"throne,\\" killed at the end of that book, let the Ringworld deteriorate to its present sad condition?<br />Still and all, this is an entertaining yarn. Niven ends it ambiguously, with the Ringworld safer, if not safe, and enough satisfying new ideas to give a reader something to chew on. There's enough trickiness, plots-within-plots and general scheming to keep a reader guessing. And only Louis Wu and Nessus have themeans to return to the Ringworld.<br />I'd expected this to be the story where Louis Wu meets Carlos Wu, who is almost certainly his father (see: \\"Crashlander\\") but that didn't happen. Stay tuned.<br />Is this a classic Niven story? Nope. But it's something of a return to form after disappointments likes \\"The Burning City.\\" Strongly recommended for \\"Ringworld\\" fans. This is not the book for newcomers to Niven's universe; start with \\"Ringworld\\" the novel.

Perhaps it is his experience in the trade that makes this such a wonderful story.<br /> William de Worde is the estranged younger son of a noble family. He earns a living providing private reports on the news of Ankh Morpork to foreign rulers. On his way to deliver his latest report to his engraver, William is struck by the power of the press; in this case, a runaway wagon carrying a moveable type press that dwarves are smuggling into the city. One thing leads to another, and, this being the Century of the Fruitbat, before long &quot;The Ankh Morpork Times&quot; is on the streets, and William is launched on a career as an editor, publisher and investigative journalist.<br /> The economy of Ankh Morpork is built on institutionalized corruption. There's no shortage of work for a budding investigative journalist, including the latest plot against the Lord Vetinari, the city's ruler. Soon William and his newspaper are pitted against conspiring nobility, a competing tabloid, assassins and the City Watch, to name just a few.<br /> From the subtle - watch the typos in the newspaper's masthead - to the slapstick - a vampire photographer who cannot survive the bright light of his camera flash - there are a lot of laughs in this book. Some of the humor clearly traces to Practhett's journalism experience; Mr. Windling and his amusing vegetables, for example. But as has been the case in the last 10 - 12 Discworld stories, the humor is a means to an end and not the end itself. Pratchett makes important points as he entertains, and raises difficult questions. What is the Truth, anyway? And does anyone care? In Lord Vetinari's apt phrase, don't readers want the Olds, rather than the News? And why does printing something make it more true?<br /> And Pratchett addresses larger issues, too. Among the fascinating new characters is Harry King, the King of the Golden River, who will recycle absolutely anything. He is wealthy, has a certain economic power, but absolutely no prestige. William's father, a member of the Old School Nobility, regards his privileges as a right. He has prestige, but what power he had is slipping away. And Gunilla Goldmountain, a dwarf who can turn lead into gold, but would really like to be married instead. Tulip, otherwise an illiterate stock villain, has a deep, informed appreciation of all things art. People are complex, and the relationships between people and society are still more complex. Pratchett reminds us of that reality by holding our life up to the funhouse mirror he has created.<br /> There are echoes of Watergate - William's informant is &quot;Deep Bone&quot; - and echoes of all those old newspaper movies like &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; and &quot;The Front Page&quot; in the relationship between William and his reporter, Sacharissa. Pratchett is particularly good at making use of our cultural references in his jokes and his points. Allusion-spotters will have a field day.<br /> Like all Pratchett's books, &quot;The Truth&quot; is great fun to read and still rewards a thoughtful reader. Highly recommended.rs is Harry King, the King of the Golden River, who will recycle absolutely anything. He is wealthy, has a certain economic power, but absolutely no prestige.

Not that witches have apprentices, you understand. Tiffany discovers that learning to be a witch can be an awfully mundane business, long on chores and caring for those too careless or to foolish to care for themselves. And short on magic. Unhappily, something else follows her from the Chalk: a Hiver, a bodiless and evil power that takes over - and quickly destroys - minds that have strong magic. Tiffany is in mortal danger, and she doesn't even know it.<br />The Nac Mac Feegle know of the danger, but they are far away, and the new Kelda, Jeannie, is a little jealous of Tiffany anyway. Miss Level only knows that there is danger and that something is wrong. It may take the greatest witch of them all, the formidable Mistress - not \\"Miss\\" - Esme Weatherwax - to save the day. Or it may take even more: Tiffany Aching may have to rise above even the levels in \\"Wee Free Men\\" to save the day - and herself.<br />As in every Pratchett book, there is wonderful humor, with the Nac Mac Feegle providing most of the comic relief. The scenes in the stagecoach ride, for example, with the Wee Free Men trying to impersonate a man by filling out a scarecrow, may be the funniest sustained bit Pratchett has done in years. But the humor is the sugarcoating for some very serious messages about growing up.<br />This is Pratchett at his very best. Yes, it's a children's book, in the sense that the language is toned down a bit, and there's a little less violence, but like the very best children's literature, this is a book an adult can read with pleasure and delight. This is a book with messages and meanings for adults, too. And Pratchett's writing, his skill in crafting a sentence, isn't one bit less sophisticated than in his other books.<br />Read for pleasure or read for deeper meaning, this is an outstanding book.

And, perhaps, the larger Khaavren stories begun with &quot;The Phoenix Guards&quot; as well. But before turning to &quot;Sethra&quot; some background is probably appropriate.<br />The entire Khaavren trilogy, of course, was written by Paarfi, who redefines the word &quot;prolix&quot; with each page he writes. Brust is merely something like a translator. There were times when his translations were stretched in &quot;Viscount&quot; and especially &quot;Castle Black,&quot; the two earlier books, but in &quot;Sethra&quot; there is a return to the wonderful style of &quot;Phoenix Guards&quot; and &quot;500 Years.&quot; This book moves along, without ever giving up the narrative conceit and tone.<br />As for the plot, in &quot;Viscount,&quot; the Empress Zerika recovered the Imperial Orb; in &quot;500 Years&quot; she fought to claim the throne; in &quot;Sethra&quot; she must fight to keep it against a Pretender and the deadly machinations of his fellow plotters. Our heros have managed to accumulate  considerable number of enemies across the four earlier books. And those enemies have all allied together in a final effort to defeat Empress Zerika, Khaavren, Aerich, Pel and Tazendra.<br />I'm unsure whether to call these books a pastiche or homage to Alexander Dumas; perhaps they are something of both. Brust . . . er, Paarfi, pokes immense fun at himself. Brust has written elsewhere that writing as Paarfi is great fun, and Brust's enjoyment and delight is apparent. Where Dumas verbosity was a consequence being paid by the word, Brust. . . er, Paarfi writes for his own pleasure and the pleasure of an attentive reader. And for the sly knife in the ribs. For example, in &quot;500 Years&quot; Paarfi notes that the decadent Phoenix Emperor, Tortaalik, changes his clothes 8-10 times a day, but that since there were already several books written on the Emperor's dress, he wouldn't write another. So much for Robert Jordan.<br />As others have noted, the narrative is delightfully infuriating. Paarfi thinks nothing of interrupting the story at a critical pound to expound - at length - on whatever has crossed his mind or his path. I caution that if you think &quot;irony&quot; describes rusty water, much of these tales will be lost on you.<br />One other nice touch: many of the events of the &quot;Viscount&quot; trilogy have been foreshadowed in the &quot;Taltos&quot; series, which is itself some ten books long now. Brust manages to keep these stories consistent with those books, which are slightly later in time, without ever sacrificing excitement or consistency.<br />Kudos to Brust. . . er. Paarfi, on a story well told and well concluded. Kudos to Tor on having the courage to publish these tales, which in several senses are well outside the normal fantasy/science fiction genre.

And for the first time, the protagonist is a grown man, with a consort and two teenage children.<br />While the overall plot remains much the same as the earlier books, there are at least a few important changes from those earlier books. Kharl suffers losses and wrongs not experienced by any of the earlier Recluce protagonists. He is a mature man, not the callow youths we have seen earlier. And his experiences take place in Nordla and in other parts of the world that we've not seen before. But along the way, fans of the Recluce series will encounter familiar characters: Talryn from &quot;The Magic of Recluce,&quot; Justen from &quot;The Order War,&quot; and several others. &quot;Wellspring of Chaos&quot; occurs some years after the destruction of Fairhaven at the end of &quot;The Order War&quot; and not too long before the events of &quot;The Magic of Recluce.&quot;<br />It's good to see Modesitt stretching a little bit. It would be better to see him stretch a little more. But the story is fun, and the ties into the earlier stories - the destroyed tower of the Duke of Lydiar, for example - is seamless. You don't have to know a thing about the Recluce series to enjoy this book, but if you are familiar with the series you will be delighted at the sly references.<br />There will plainly be a sequel; Modesitt gets suitable mileage out of a good character. I look forward to it.	2004-04-18

The premises are simple. There are \\"Gates,\\" a technology that let an older race move through time and space at their whim. And eventually, that race and most of the universe was brought to ruin by too extravagant use of the Gates. But the Gates themselves survived, a temptation to all, with risk that it will all happen again.<br />Humans and their allies agree the Gates must be destroyed. But there is only one way to accomplish the goal. A doomed quest to travel each and every gate, destroying each Gate behind them. One hundred start out. Over the years, the task destroys all but one of those one hundred: Morgaine alone survives. She has become half-mythical, known on worlds she has never touched because time itself has become strange and twisted.<br />Her sole companion is Vanyel, himself a bastard, kin slayer and outlaw. Over the course of the four novels, Vanyel is himself transformed, and the relationship between Moragine and Vanyel is one of the great relationships of fiction.<br />Lastly, Morgaine carries a weapon and tool that itself embodies the technology of the Gates. A terrible engine of destruction, Changeling is not just a technologically rationalized version of Moorcock's demon sword. It is also the tool that will allow its bearer to destroy the final Gate, if it can be found, if Morgaine and Vanyel can survive, if their wills don't fail.<br />The Saga takes you across three very different worlds, where Morgaine and Vanyel face very different challenges. The books date from Cherryh's first novel, \\"Gate of Ivrel,\\" to the third, \\"Fires of Azeroth,\\" written later at the height of her formidable powers. You can see Cherryh's skills improve as well. Be sure to find and read \\"Exile's Gate,\\" the fourth tale of Morgaine and Venyel, arguably even better.<br />These are superb stories, among the best in the genre. Highly recommended.	2004-03-15

It was out of print for a number of years, but is now available in \\"The Fantasies of Robert Heinlein.\\" I mention \\"Jonathan Hoag\\" because as he often did in the last decades of his life, Heinlein returned to some of the themes of earlier books.  He returned to some of the ideas of \\"Jonathan Hoag\\" in this remarkable book, \\"Job.\\"<br />Read at one level, this novel is a updated biblical Book of Job. The main character is put through the wringer because of a wager made by his Creator. Read at another level, it is the story of transformation: religious bigot and all-around prig Alex Hergensheimer is transformed into a much better person, even if that may not have been anyone's intent. But at another, deeper level, Heinlein illustrates what is really important, what really matters, what really endures. Because Alex discovers, over the course of the story, what real love can be, and how real love is the most important thing in the universe. More important than the dubious Heaven he finds when, about to lose his wager, the Creator pulls the Last Trump and Alex ascends to sainthood and Heaven, without his true love. He abandons Heaven and harrows Hell to find her. Heinlein couldn't have put it much more plainly.<br />My favorite scene: when, risen into Heaven as a Saint, Alex asks Heaven's help in finding his wife. And Heaven produces his wife. His first wife. From before he found real love. She's a harridan, and the transformed Alex is appalled. Even the angels are embarrassed for Alex.<br />The denouement hearkens back to the denouement of \\"Jonathan Hoag.\\" For me, it works, but I can sympathize with those who find the ending, quite literally, too deus machina.<br />Like \\"Jonathan Hoag,\\" you are never sure where this story is going to end, and I won't spoil it for you here. Except to say that the implied limits on human understanding are bittersweet. We can find true love, Heinlein seems to be saying, and we can live lives filled with love, but we cannot really understand the universe.<br />This is Heinlein at his best. No pontificating all-knowing protagonists, very little of the political polemics that started with \\"Stranger.\\" Just an excellent story that invites deeper thought. Highly recommended.standing are bittersweet.

And while this book doesn't have quite the sheer delight of the first, &quot;Bridge of Birds,&quot; it is still a wonderful adventure set in the same mythical China. And this novel confirms what you suspected after &quot;Bridge of Birds&quot; - Hughart is no fluke.<br />Chinese peasant  Number Ten Ox, Master Li's client in the first book, is his assistant now, and troubled because it appears ancient Master Li may drop dead before another worthwhile mystery comes along. Ox need not have worried. The Abbot of the monastery in the Valley of Sorrows arrives with a tale of murder, terror and the return of the Laughing Prince, the lunatic despot who ruled the Valley of Sorrows 750 years earlier. How can Master Li resist the temptation? How can we resist?<br />Once again Master Li and Number Ten Ox must solve a mystery, and once again the mystery is fringed with the supernatural, homicide and genuine, laugh out loud developments. Along the way they meet some truly memorable characters, including Grief of Dawn, a young lady with a deeply mysterious past, and Moon Boy, a sound master and an entirely marvellous creation.<br />Perhaps the best invention is the characters' mind trip through the Chinese Hell, which makes the efforts of Orpheus and Dante look pretty pitiful in comparison. The ending is less of a stunner than &quot;Bridge of Birds,&quot; but this story is a little more mature and tightly crafted than &quot;Bridge.&quot;<br />The only fair criticism of &quot;Stone&quot; is that Hughart only wrote one more book, &quot;Eight Skilled Gentlemen.&quot; There have to be Master Li stories not yet told; I wish Mr. Hughart would write them.<br />A wonderful story, amusing and moving, that exposes the reader to parts of Chinese mythology in the nicest possible way. Exceptionally well written. Highly recommended.	2004-01-20

Maybe it's the problem faced by any author in the second book of any trilogy: a bridge can only be so exciting. Or maybe it's because we know so much about how it will end; after all, it's Vlad Talos' workaday world. But whatever the reason, this is the weakest of the Dragaera books to date.<br />Now a weak Brust novel is head and shoulders above most fantasy writers' work. This is a lot of fun to read. But compared to the Machiavellian plot twists of Jhereg and Yendi, or the brilliant writing in The Phoenix Guards, well, this is just slightly pedestrian.<br />And that's for a Brust fan, familiar with previous (well, and subsequent) events. I think a reader new to Brust, or worse still, new to the Viscount Trilogy, would be completely bewildered. Who are all these people?<br />Especially compared to the most recent Vlad Taltos novel, Lord of Castle Black is a little weak. The Vlad Taltos series is very nearly as tightly linked as the Khaavren books, of which this is the fourth. In each of the Vlad Taltos books, by contrast, Brust has brought a startling new twist, a new and stunning revelation about the world or about his protagonist. Perhaps Vlad is inherently more interesting than any of the characters in the Khaavren series. Perhaps it's just that I can relate to a human (well, Easterner) better.<br />Still, as a setup for the third book this is a good read, and there is still a lot of ground to cover. Paarfi's writing is always good for a smile, and Mysteries continue to be Explained. Brust is far from the kind of self-indulgent piffle of, say, Robert Jordan. No, wait, that's too harsh. Brust is the polar opposite of Jordan. Whatever its limitations, it is very hard to put Lord of Castle Black down. Like all Brust books, it's a page turner and worth your time. Recommended.	2003-12-05

The country has been fighting with its neighbors so long that there aren't very many young men left to be soldiers. So even though a woman dressing as a man is an Abomination Unto Nuggan (garlic, chocolate, ears, rocks and much more at all Abominations unto the crazed Borogravian deity), Polly Perks dresses as a man and signs up for the Ins and Outs, the Tenth Division of the Borogravian army. No one looks too carefully; recruits are getting too hard to find.<br />The title is a play on an obscure John Knox essay, a diatribe against women in leadership positions. Army life, officers, NCOs, patriotism, Army intelligence, institutional religion and especially sexism all get the Pratchett Treatment. More than any of his other books, I was strongly reminded of Mark Twain's later satires. Pratchett is a little gentler than Twain, and his approach is more methodical, but the same simmering anger is evident. Pratchett's distaste for the institutions and respect for the individuals is made completely clear. Stupidity, Polly Perks comes to realize, is simply too dangerous to have around.<br />There are a few wonderful new characters, including Jackrum, a legendary sergeant in the Borogravian army, apparently ageless and, upon his word, \\"not a dishonest man;\\" and Maladict, one of Polly's fellow recruits, who has substituted a lust for blood for a lust for coffee (Pratchett is plainly a serious coffee drinker). And there are cameos of greater or lesser extent from Watch characters Duke Samuel Vimes, Corporal Angua, Buggy Swires and Reg Shoe; and William de Worde and his photographer, Otto.<br />But mostly this is about Polly, an intelligent, decent person, placed in the madness and folly of war. She masters the art of impersonating a man - mostly belching and walking differently - practices shaving with a blunted razor and learns the importance of a strategically placed pair of socks. She learns how to tell if it is just the socks talking. She learns that sometimes when you ask, \\"Are we winning the war?\\" you might not be asking the right question. And she demonstrates that sometimes the right man for a task is a woman. Or perhaps several women.<br />Pratchett touches on another theme, too, the difference between worship and belief. \\"Small Gods\\" focused on that distinction, and it plays a critical role here. Borogravians may worship Nuggan (even if they sometimes ignore the newest Abominations) but they believe in the Duchess, even though she may be dead. And, as events unfold, the difference is critical.<br />There aren't many belly laughs, but this is a mature, amusing and instructive novel. It doesn't hurt that the themes are topical, but it's too much to hope that either Tony Blair or George W. Bush will read, let alone understand, what Pratchett is saying.

In a science fiction novel.<br />- He has chosen as one theme crucifixion: individual's crucifixion by the Shrike, humanity's crucifixion by the cruciform parasite, and Aenea's horrifying death. Crucifixion is at the heart of the West's most prominent religion.<br />- Like any writer of a series, he is constrained by the myriad loose ends from the three earlier books.<br />Simmons meets all of these challenges. He writes a suspenseful, emotionally engaging novel that takes all of these ideas and constraints and deals with them fairly, consistently and pretty completely.<br />Not many writers have the wit and courage to attempt these ideas; only a fraction of those who have the wit and courage also have the talent to bring it off. Simmons not only makes the attempt; he mostly succeeds.<br />The criticisms and negative reviews, it seems to me, stem from those who don't understand this is a novel of ideas, and those who give little credit to the breadth of what Simmons is trying to do. Aenea's final months and messy death is nothing less than a technologically rationalized replay of Christ's, recast and rethought in very impressive ways. Raul's rebirth is Saul's re-birth, isn't it?<br />No, this isn't a sword and fur jockstrap story, or yet another &quot;coming of age with a light saber&quot; Hero's journey. This is a book that welcomes and rewards a thinking reader. I wish there were more examples in the genre.<br />Well conceived, brilliantly written. Highly recommended.ed, brilliantly written.

It has been almost 11 years since &quot;The Outskirters Secret,&quot; the last book in this remarkable series. It was probably worth the wait, at least if we don't have to wait ten years for the next volume.<br />At the risk of spoilers, imagine a world that's nearly uninhabitable by man, filled with plants and animals inimical to earthkind. Now imagine a program for the terraforming of that world, a program that will take centuries if not millennia, involving first infrared bombardment by satellite and the burning of the borderlands, then sowing a genetically engineered plant that serves as a transition to earth life, and then a succession of increasingly earth-like plants.<br />After hundreds or thousands of years, in the areas treated first, the land is pretty much indistinguishable from earth; at the borders, life is strange and harsh. Most of the planet is apparently unchanged. Different peoples and cultures inhabit the various zones as the millennia-long terraforming proceeds.<br />To make things stranger still, those with knowledge have made themselves sorcerers and wizards, wielding technology when and how it suits them, quarreling among themselves and extirpating ordinary people who try to recover science and technology. As a result, most residents in this world are technologically ignorant, unknowingly held in that state by the technocractic wizards. Most humans think technology is magic, in a neat reversal of Clark's Law. Everyone but the wizards is completely unaware this is an alien world.<br />The sorcerers tolerate a band of Socratean scholars, the Steerswomen, who have re-developed principles of logic and serve as explorers, historians and cartographers. They mingle with the people of this world, operating by two rules: they will answer any question you ask, provided that you answer the questions they ask you. If you refuse to answer a Steerswoman's question, they shun you. It works pretty well... Sometimes a steerswoman - and some steerswomen are men - quits the order. They are said to be &quot;lost.&quot;<br />But the wizards have their schemes, and as Rowan the Steerswoman struggles to understand them with the help of Bel, an outskirter, a member of one of the tribes on the fringe of the terraforming, the importance of understanding those schemes is increasingly urgent. Because one of the wizards is willing to use one of the terraforming tools in the satellite system to burn terraformed lands, and it is a terrifying weapon. The same wizard has caused one of the satellites to crash, at what jeopardy to the terraforming product we don't yet know.<br />It is fascinating to watch Rowan struggle to understand the issues and her situation, to see her begin to grasp that the world she knows is not the world on which earthkind evolved. With her, we are ignorant as to the wizards' motives, but we can understand better than her the risks their actions are creating.<br />The first two novels led to the conclusion that one of the wizards had set out to sabotage the terraforming process and, incidentally, to kill Rowan and Bel. This new novel tells of Rowan's efforts to find that mysterious wizard, and centers on the life that is native to this world. What if there is an intelligent alien species inhabiting this world? What if the terraforming process is destroying that alien intelligence? And Kirstein's aliens are truly alien; you will not mistake them, in the words of Alex Panshin, for someone from New Jersey. And all the while, there is the lost steersman of the title, who may be lost in more ways than one.<br />This is an excellent story. Wonderful, vivid characters are set in a plausible, complex  world, with characters who struggle to understand the things that they encounter. Complex, unpredictable plots. Some reviewers have described these stories as fantasy; they are not. They are science fiction, and exceptionally well-conceived science fiction. These novels are genuinely new approaches to ideas.

If you ask her a question, she has to answer with the truth; if she asks you a question, you, too, have to answer. If you don't, no steerswoman anywhere will answer your questions. Under these simple rules, steerswomen have become the navigators, cartographers, explorers and researchers of their world. Knowledge is a steerswoman's life.<br />There is another group that holds knowledge on this world: the wizards. They can work magic. But they don't share their knowledge, they won't answer any questions, and they are under the steerwomen's ban. Early on, a reader will recognize the wizards' &quot;magic&quot; as simply technology, a technology that the wizards deny to the rest of the world.<br />&quot;The Steerwoman's Road&quot; is a compendium of two earlier books set in this world, &quot;The Steerswoman&quot; and &quot;The Outskirter's Secret.&quot; In &quot;The Steerswoman,&quot; Rowan is investigating bluish-black jewels that she has found in odd places along a long line across the Inner Lands of her world. For some reason, this simple investigation causes the wizards to attempt to kill her. Allied with Bel, a barbarian from the &quot;Outskirts,&quot; the primitive part of the world, she narrowly escapes repeated attempts on her life. Finally, with the help of her sister steerswomen, Bel and an unlikely, even unwanted ally, she tries to solve the mystery of the wizards and their magic.<br />In &quot;The Outskirter's Secret,&quot; Rowan and Bel journey beyond the edge of the known world, to and beyond the Outskirts in their quest to solve the mystery of the blue-black jewels and a possible fallen guidestar. But it is the journey that is important, because in the course of that journey Rowan learns more about her world; she begins to understand the truth about the world she and her sister steerwomen have taken for granted. And she begins to understand just how serious a threat the wizards, and one wizard in particular, may be.<br />These are brilliant stories. Exceptional plotting, vivid characters, a well-imagined, consistent world and important themes. Because the reader understands technology, Rowan's struggles to come to grips with wizards and their &quot;magic&quot; are particularly delightful. A reader will recognize the &quot;blue-black jewels&quot; at once as integrated circuits, and the &quot;fallen guidestar&quot; as a fallen geosynchronous satellite. Watching Rowan use principles of logic to comprehend technology is simply delightful.

These stories are set on the continent of Corus, about 1,000 years after the Cataclysm. Corus has forgotten most of its technology, and even a millennium later the pre-Cataclysm empire of the Duarchy is remembered as an idyllic time.<br />In Corus, a few rare individuals, including Alucius, the hero, have Talent, the ability to do magic. In &quot;Legacies&quot; Alucius started to come to terms with his Talent. In &quot;Darknesses&quot; he must save both his family and his world. In &quot;Legacies,&quot; Alucius, literally &quot;from light,&quot; is a Soarer's child, and there is more than a hint here that some or all of his Talent may have been bred into him. The uses and abuses of power and technology are one of Modesitt's recurring themes, and those themes are developed more thoroughly and more subtlely here than in any of his earlier works.<br />Modesitt's writing continues to improve. His plotting is more intricate and complex, his characterization is three dimensional, and his pacing, always his best skill, is now impeccable. Unlike many of his recent works, you will not be able to predict the good guys, the bad guys or even the flow of the story. The surprises keep coming.<br />&quot;Legacies&quot; mostly raised questions. Some are answered by &quot;Darknesses,&quot; and while Modesitt reportedly said this closes the Corean Chronicles, there are many, many loose plot thread and mysteries. This is a richer, deeper world than the setting for the Recluce stories. I look forward to the next installment.<br />This is a good yarn, well told.	2003-09-07

He not only borrows ideas for stories; he uses the forms of the great stories of western civilization and even quotes from them in the story. If there really are memes, anyone reading \\"The Hyperion Cantos\\" risked infection with John Keats' poetry and John Bunyan's \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\"<br />With \\"Ilium,\\" the infectious risk is Homer's \\"Iliad\\" and \\"Odyssey;\\" Shakespeare's sonnets and \\"The Tempest;\\" and - gulp - Marcel Proust's \\"Remembrance of Things Lost.\\" Yowza.<br />\\"Ilium\\" is three seemingly unrelated stories from the 40th Century, stories from three different possibilities of what man might become. There are the Moravecs, inhabiting Jupiter's and Saturn's moons, man-machine hybrids, with a lingering taste for the works of Shakespeare and Proust. There are the Eloi - an appreciative nod to H. G Wells here - who turn out to be all too horrifyingly Eloi, a \\"post-literate\\" and possibly degenerate normal human race. And there are the gods of Olympus - Mons Olympus - who may be post-humans, engaged in a bloody re-enactment of the Trojan War.<br />We see the story through the eyes of Moravecs, a few of the humans and one of Scholi, the observers of the gods, re-constructed college classics professors, sent to report to the gods on the re-enacted Trojan War. And we watch as the Scholi - one in particular - are dragged from their roles as observers to participants, and as the three stories merge into one. It's a superb piece of plotting and narration.<br />There are resonances from \\"The Hyperion Cantos,\\" but they do not distract. There are no emotional bombshells equivalent to F. Paul Dure's experience - for my money, nothing in science fiction touches the story of F. Paul Dure - but there are stunning surprises. You *will* cheer Achilles' final line.<br />The final message, or one of the final messages, may be a little grating: that even as late as the 40th century it is and will be a case of kill or be killed, eat or be eaten. But you can't fault the story-telling. Simmons is in line for another Hugo nomination.<br />This is the first book of a projected two book series (note to those new to Simmons: the four-book Hyperion cantos was also projected to be two books).

In fact, Om is on hard times, with an entire nation that worships him but only one believer. And if a god has no believers, it becomes a small god. And Om has become so weak he can only manifest as a turtle.<br />Through the course of their adventures, Brutha an Om wander through the wilderness, confront heretics and madmen, learn to recognize the perils of tyranny and theocracy, and generally tour the highlights of the Old Testament. Brutha visits classical Greece, in the form of Omnia's neighbor, Ephebe, and learns what true evil can be. It sounds like philosophy, and in some measure it is, but under Pratchett's masterful touch the story is so well done that it is only afterwards, when you are through with the tale, that the message hits you. At speed, right between the eyes.<br />Pratchett recast his ideas about belief later, and in quite a different way, in &quot;Hogfather.&quot; But &quot;Small Gods&quot; makes important points, as well as being a glorious romp through the apocrypha.<br />This book is not for anyone whose sense of righteousness gets in the way of their sense of humor. This is a satire of religious excesses and pokes fun at worship when it gets separated from belief. For some, it may cut to close to the bone. But for the rest of it, this is a terrific book.	2003-07-19

A Very Good Book	Terry Pratchett won a Carnegie Medal for his first children's book set in his Discworld, \\"The Amazing Maurice and His Educated Rodents.\\" He has a good shot at a second award for \\"Wee Free Men.\\" It's that good.<br />Nine year old Tiffany Aching was born on The Chalk. The Achings have lived on The Chalk and tended their sheep for centuries. Tiffany's grandmother was the matriarch of the Aching clan, and while she never called herself a witch, she never denied it, either. Tiffany is still trying to adjust to the death of her grandmother, and to the birth of her sticky little brother, Wentworth, when she is attacked by a monster out of Faerie. One thing leads to another, and before long she must rescue her brother from Faerie, be the kelda of the Nac Mac Feegle, the Wee Free Men of the title, and save the world from the terrors of Faerie. Because there is no one else.<br />One of Pratchett's many skills is inversion. In \\"Amazing Maurice,\\" he inverted the Pied Piper of Hamlin. In \\"Wee Free Men,\\" he inverts children's fairy tales in general. Instead of a magic sword, Tiffany has a plain old iron frying pan. Instead of a wise mentor, she has a toad who used to be a lawyer. Instead of an army, she has the Nac Mac Feegle. The Queen of Faerie, Tiffany's antagonist, is about as far from a noble Tolkien elf as you can get. Because the Queen of Faery has the power to steal your dreams, your worst nightmares, and trap you inside them.<br />And Tiffany must confront the Queen on her own ground, in the land of nightmares, where the monsters are terrifying and real. You don't have to reflect very long to understand Pratchett is working at several levels. The themes are meaningful and accessible to children without the slightest condescension.<br />Some of the characters - the Queen herself, the Nac Mac Feegle, and wonderful cameos at the end of the story - are familiar from other stories. But as was the case with \\"Amazing Maurice,\\" you don't have to know the other Pratchett stories to relish \\"Wee Free Men.\\" This is masterful story-telling, hysterically funny and very scary by turn. Pratchett is very, very good, and this story is one of his best.

A well-conceived world where Asimov's Axiom - &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot; - is given a wonderful twist. The geography, the culture and the people are skillfully developed. Best of all, there is a woman protagonist who is simply delightful, and who brings a life devoted to the acquisition of knowledge to a quest tale. The sequel, &quot;The Outskirter's Secret,&quot; is even better and begins to give you glimpses of the true nature of the world in which these tales are told.<br />The bad news is that the tale is only half told. Fans of Kirstein and her heroine have been waiting years to see what happens next. It was starting look like the story would never be finished.<br />The new good news is that a third book - &quot;The Steerswomans Road&quot; - is coming out later this year.<br />With any luck, the publisher will re-publish the first two books, which appear to be out of print, and allow Kirstein's story to reach a broader audience.<br />This is a terrific introduction to a well-crafted world. Strongly recommended.	2003-03-14

And at other times he steps back just a little too far from the role he has written for himself. But there is nothing else to criticize in this excellent book.<br />Five hours northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands by propjet there are series of islands and atolls that are the breeding grounds of tens of thousands of sea birds. Of the many species of birds that breed there, the largest, the one that must be wrapped in the most superlatives, is the Laysan Albatross. And one Laysan Albatross, that Safina names Amelia, is the principle subject and unifying thread of this book.<br />From Coelridge's  &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; to the horrifying pollution of our ocean, Amelia is the eye through which we view her astonishing world. Amelia is tagged with a small satellite transmitter, and Safina includes maps showing the travels Amelia makes to feed herself and her chick. The distances beggar the imagination. Through her eyes and her journeys, Safina touches on the host of issues and breathtaking wonders of the the fauna of the Northwest Hawaiian Islands.<br />It's a tour de force, and I recommend it to you.	2003-02-11

A. Clarence Shandon, the Silverlock of the title, is not a very nice person as the story opens. Shipwrecked, he is saved by Widsith Amerigin Demodocus Taliesin Golias, who is more than a bard, he is a Maker. And from the moment he meets Golias, Silverlock falls into stories, one after another. He lands on the great island of the Commonwealth, which at one level is the Commonwealth of letters, literature, stories. And on another is simply a grand romp through the great stories of our culture.<br />For Silverlock, who is as ignorant of literature as a fish, it's initially simply something that happens to him. He is, in Golias's kind phrase, &quot;Not well informed.&quot; Nor are we. Whether it's hanging out with Robin Hood, wandering into the scenes of Shakespeare's &quot;Midsummer's Night Dream, or quaffing mead with Beowulf, or even his own quests; it's initially all the same. But gradually the stories he lives and the stories he hears, and Golias's own example, transform him into a better person.<br />I could tell you that &quot;Silverlock&quot; is an allegory, that Myers is telling you that literature has the power to transform, and make a person better, and that life without literature is not worth living. But that's like saying &quot;Hamlet&quot; is a story about a depressed prince. Saying this book is an allegory is implying its cod liver oil. It's not. This book is masterful as pure, sweet entertainment; the encounter with Izaak Walton and a dozen others is amusing even if you have never heard of any of them.<br />Sure, what makes the book even more fun is trying to recognize the characters and situations Silverlock encounters. Some are easy: Captain Ahab and the Great White Whale; Circe from &quot;Odysseus;&quot; drifting down a river on Huck Finn's raft. Others are much harder. But that's a game to play afterwards. There's no time when you are wrapped up in the story itself.<br />Myers' point is that literature is transforming. And this book will transform you. You will have great fun reading it - it's a ripping good story - but there's a real danger that Silverlock's encounter with Bercilak will send you to read &quot;Gawain and the Green Night,&quot; or that the visit to the Deiphobe will send you off to the enchantments of Greek myth, or that the hysterically funny encounter with the Dean of Knights Errant will make you finally read &quot;Don Quixote.&quot; The dangers are real in the Commonwealth, and not the least of them is the danger of being transformed by the experience of reading this book.<br />Understand that when Silverlock's guide, Golias, tells a story, or invents a poem in the course of this book, he is Making, he is creating new and wonderful characters that Silverlock or anyone else just might encounter as they wander through the Commonwealth. I promise you that John Myers Myers is himself a Maker. &quot;Silverlock&quot; is Making at its best.e story itself.<br />Myers' point is that literature is transforming.

His characters - his young characters, in particular - are well drawn and vivid. His narrative is good, particularly in battle scenes. His handling of romance is less elegant, perhaps betraying some of his religious beliefs. But as much as I like him, I really, really wish he could come up with a new plot. He seems to have read or watched Bill Moyers' interviews of Joseph Campbell, and never gotten beyond the part about the Young Hero.<br />Alucius is a young man growing up in a fairly obscure part of the continent of Corus. He is a Herder, a part of a family that raises Nightsheep, and spins their wool into a kind of low-tech, flexible body armor. A natural nemourlon, if you will. Early on Alucius discovers he has magical/psychic powers, Talent. \\"Legacies\\" is the story of his growth as a young man and his growth in his ability to use his Talent. It is also the story of awkward, ambiguous good against comfortable, complacent and even seductive evil. If the adjoining country of Madrien is founded on an evil use of Talent, and enslaves men, but let's its people live comfortable and safe lives, should the evil use of Talent be destroyed?<br />If all of this sounds an awful lot like the Legend of Recluce, well, yes, it is. There's an added element of an earlier, more technological, collapsed culture whose powerful artifacts still litter the landscape, some to deadly effect. And no one will confuse Alucius's home, the Iron Valley, with the Black Island of Recluce. But here, as in Recluce, a specially Talented youngster is dragged against his will into war, with dramatic consequences for everyone involved.<br />As other reviewers have noted, we only get confusing glimpses of the earlier cultures and history of this land, and the events of the book take place on the westernmost part of the continent. Presumably, most of the loose ends will get cleared up over the next two books of this projected trilogy.<br />The writing is better than it was in the Recluce books (especially the early books), but the basis of the Talent isn't as well explained as the Order/Chaos of Recluce. There's a plethora of very strange creatures around: sanders, sand wolves, soarers and more. Perhaps all this will get explained later. For now, I guess readers are to take it as an annoying kind of foreshadowing.<br />The pacing is far better, although as has been the case since \\"The Magic of Recluce,\\" there's not much question of what is going to happen, only how it is going to happen.<br />I just wish Modesitt could bring his considerable talents to new plots.ce books (especially the early books), but the basis of the Talent isn't as well explained as the Order/Chaos of Recluce.

The first and older set involves the tales of Vlad Taltos, assassin, crimelord and human - well, Easterner. He lives in a society dominated by tall, very long-lived, sorcerous Elves - well, Humans. Think of Raymond Chandler, but more imaginative and much better written. The second and more recent series is written as a conscious, deliberate homage to Alexander Dumas, most famously the author of \\"The Three Musketeers.\\" This novel is the third book in that series, and is very much a sequel to \\"The Phoenix Guards\\" and \\"Five Hundred Years After.\\" In this book, those two sets of stories finally begin to merge.<br />The novel opens with the Drageara and the Elves' empire in chaos. The events at the end of \\"Five Hundred Years After\\" have destroyed the empire, and in its place brought plagues, squabbling warlords, scheming sorcerors and invading Easterners. Into this stew Brust brings the story of the restoration of sorcery and the Empire, the end of the Interregnum and the prolix writing style of Paarfi of Roundwood, the fictional author of each of these historic romances.<br />Paarfi should be a Hungarian translation of Dumas. Except that Brust is more ironic and sometimes hysterically funny in his \\"translation\\" of Paarfi. Between the hyperformal courtesy of the characters and their circumlocutions, the narrative sometimes takes some wild tangents.<br />But the narrative thread is never lost, and if you appreciate sheer elegance in writing and wildly imaginative plotting, you will like this book. Old friends from both narrative lines appear, and a selection of new and equally wonderful characters.<br />This is the first book of a trilogy, and as is the case in any first book of a trilogy a fair amount of time is spent in introducing characters and laying out plot threads. Presumably the second and third books will tell us why Morrolan (well known to readers of the Taltos books) is involved, and the role Ibronka will play.<br />One of Brust's finest characteristics is his willingness to experiment. In some of the Taltos books, the experiments involved the narrative voice or view, for example. Combining the Dumas-themed romances with a trilogy is another such experiment. Brust is deft and delightful in this first book. I look forward to the next two.<br />Don't neglect the essay at the end on how to write like Paarfi. On each re-reading, it is more amusing. The essay, like the hysterical \\"interview\\" of Paarfi by Brust at the end of \\"Five Hundred Years After,\\" is very nearly perfectly written.<br />If you love good writing, even if you have never heard of Duams, you will like this novel.ed, and the role Ibronka will play. <br />One of Brust's finest characteristics is his willingness to experiment.

I think it's the best written of the entire Terry Pratchett library, but I only give it four stars.<br />The thing about any time machine story is that you already know how it comes out. And, for me at least, that takes a bit out of Pratchett's toolbox. Pratchett novels in the past have been a wild ride where you were never completely sure how it would all work out. \\"Night Watch\\" is a wild ride, but it's a roller coaster ride, and you know at the end of the ride you'll be, more or less, back at the starting point, breathless but okay.<br />There's also a bit of a character development issue. Maybe it's just the Monks of History having problems again, but how did eager young nightwatchman Sam Vimes - not John Keel, but Sam Vimes - turn into the lush we know and love in \\"Guards! Guards!\\"? We first met Sam Vimes, remember, lying drunk in a gutter in a rainstorm...<br />Still and all, this is an excellent addition to the Night Watch series. Not an introduction, mind you. I think you need to meet Fred Colon and Nobby Nobbs in \\"Guards! Guards!\\" or \\"Men at Arms\\" to appreciate those first, earlier encounters here. Especially to ah... savor the meeting with Nobby. Longstanding mysteries are solved, and half the fun is knowing they are mysteries in advance. Why Reg Shoe is a zombie. Whether Vetinari is indeed an assassin.<br />Pratchett's wordcraft is as good or even better than it has ever been. He is particularly deft in seamlessly intertwining the linked story threads and his message, which he slips in as craftily as any assassin. The party at which Mad Lord Winder is not assassinated is particularly well done.<br />I'm not rabid about Pratchett - I'm not a chronic hanger-on at L-Space, and there are some small sections of The APF I've not committed to memory. But any Prachett book is cause for keen anticipation and delighted, delightful reading. \\"Night Watch\\" is no exception. Oh, and stay off the Library dome in lightning storms...ightning storms...	2002-11-22

James Gardner's stories postulate a universe in which humans are far, far behind the technological levels of the other alien species of the darn near omnipotent League of Peoples. For the first time in his universe, he takes us to Earth where, for unexplained reasons, humanity mostly has reverted to an early-1800's level of technology. Except that nanotechnology has made sorcery and psionics possible, and there are something called Spark Lords who have technology that is very nearly magic.<br />And it turns out there are other aliens who are fighting battles on Earth. And one race of these aliens is Truly Evil; homicidal, ..., shape-shifting and disgusting. And let me caution you that Gardner apparently doesn't like cottage cheese, and you probably won't, either, after your read this book.<br />The plot involves a handful of private school teachers who stumble into this morass when one of their students dies messily at the hand of the bad guy or guys. Naturally, most of them die in the course of the novel; naturally, the survivors save the day.<br />Gardner has been rightly accused of indulging in silly science, and that tendency is full flower in \\"Trapped.\\" As an enjoyable yarn, this story, like many of Gardner's books, is okay. But if you bring any critical thinking to the plot or the characters, the whole thing falls apart like a soggy tissue. A galaxy-spanning, transcendent hive mind that enjoys ...? Humans, aware of technology, who are stuck in a horse-and-buggy culture? Shape-shifting cellule organisms?<br />There are also massive inconsistencies with the earlier books. Readers of Gardner's earlier novels know the League of Peoples has some pretty strong ideas about homicide; if, as Harriet Klausner has suggested in an earlier review, the Spark Lords are from another world, they sure better not ever try to leave Earth. . .<br />Despite the silly science and the plot holes, this is a pleasant read. But buy the paperback, not the hardback, and keep your expectations - and your incredulity - firmly in check.tions - and your incredulity - firmly in check.	2002-10-31

And the result is wonderful, perhaps the best of all the Discworld books.<br />The book has its hilarious moments, as you would expect. Not the least of them a new character, Bilious, the Oh-God of Hangovers. There's even bathroom humor. But while the humor sugar-coats the story, there's a great deal more here. From the opening pages, when Susan Sto Helit, Death's granddaughter, has to deal with a monster in the cellars, to Death's comments on the final pages, this is a book about belief and the power of belief. On the Discworld, of course, the power of belief is transcendant, but like all of the Discworld books, Pratchett uses the fun house mirror of the Disc to teach us a great deal about our own world.<br />You can read this book with a great deal of pleasure by just relaxing and enjoying the ride. The laughs are all there, the jokes and parody as wonderful as ever. But the second or third of tenth time through, think a bit about what it might mean, and might be happening on a different level.<br />One of Pratchett's many gifts is be wildly, hysterically funny, while at the same time sliding a knife of hard truth into your ribs. The Hogfather's holiday sled may be pulled by pigs and not reindeer, but the pigs and the reindeer are all powered by the same thing: belief. It's what makes us human. And in Pratchett's skillful hands, that simple truth takes on whole new meanings.<br />I may not be able to meet Death's challenge and show him, in the whole universe, a single grain of justice, but I can point to some insight and truth. Read this book and see if I'm not right.	2002-09-18

If you look at the awkward writing in one of her early books, like \\"Dragonflight,\\" and compare it with the superior writing in, say, \\"All the Weyrs,\\" you can see the development. Ms. McCaffrey has always brought new ideas to her readers. But much of the pleasure for old fans has been seeing the level of writing improve.<br />Until now. The \\"Freedom\\" series has been interesting, but the ideas in it were not particularly new. It's plowed ground. Even the late L. Ron Hubbard has written a \\"defeat the evil alien invaders\\" book, although he didn't have the heroine sleeping with the enemy. Ms. McCaffrey brought her own style to the first three books, with some new twists and a sparer, more polished style than we had seen in earlier books. But in \\"Freedom's Ransom,\\" the fourth book in the series, she seems to have run out of steam and skipped one or two rewrites. Not the least of her problems is that the series really concluded emotionally in the third book; this novel feels like an afterthought...<br />As other reviewers have noted, there is some sloppy research, and as an economics lesson, it's not going to cause Alan Greenspan any sleepless nights. And speaking of sleepless nights, there might be a few too many references to coffee in the course of the book.<br />Rumor has it her next book returns us to Pern. I'll look forward to it, and count this as an aberration.	2002-09-05

He was the one who first dragged fantasy into the practice of spending hundreds of pages doing little to advance plot, characterization or theme. But there's no question that in the last 4-5 books of the \\"Wheel of Time\\" Mr. Jordan has set new benchmarks, leaving Mr. Donaldson and other pretenders to the title of \\"extended narrative\\" far, far behind. Maybe 4,000 pages or so behind.<br />It's gotten so bad that even the modest advancement of the main plot that's in that last two chapters of this opus feels like a triumph. Finally, something happens. It makes you willing to forgive perhaps as much as half of the wasted paper that has gone before in this book. It doesn't make you forgive \\"Path of Daggers,\\" arguably the longest book in the fantasy genre in which nothing meaningful happens. But perhaps half of \\"Winter's Heart.\\"<br />Special note to Jordan's publisher, Forge: Please, get this man an editor. If he has an editor, fire that one and find one with some spine. Force your author to start wrapping up some of the narrative threads. And I mean more than one per volume. What kind of contract did you give him, anyway? How about a bonus for Jordan for each narrative element he closes (and a penalty for each new one he opens)?<br />Special note to Mr. Jordan: Shoot the dog. Wrap it up. Finish it. How about a goal of moving the plot significantly in each chapter?<br />But I won't be buying any more of the volumes until someone tells me the last volume finally has been published. I'll buy it.

If you haven't read \\"Left Hand,\\" you should.<br />She has returned to that universe many times since, most recently in \\"The Telling,\\" but only in \\"Birthday of the World\\" does she approach issues of humanity and sexuality and its implications with the brilliance and sheer elegance that she brought to \\"Left Hand.\\" The short stories of \\"Birthday\\" are as good as short science fiction gets.<br />One of LeGuin's many gifts is to tell a fine story, while at the same time holding a mirror to our own world. By creating relationships that are different from our own - sedoretu, a complex marriage system, for example - she allows us to see from a new viewpoint, and more clearly, the express and implied values in our own culture. Don't misunderstand; there is no preaching or lecturing, only a very fine set of stories very well told.<br />Another of her gifts is to take an intellectual structure and wrap a marvellous story around it. In her fantasy novel \\"Wizard of Earthsea,\\" it was Jungian psychology. Here she takes her background in cultural anthropology to explore the modalities of human relationships. Her storytelling is so deft that you can read these stories for the superb writing that they are and enjoy them immensely. But they work at other levels, too, and seeing the intellectual structure cleverly crafted into the narrative gives the perceptive reader additional pleasure.<br />LeGuin's brilliant characters, her spare writing and her eloquence are as evident here as in her longer writing. This amazing woman has been writing at this level for more than 30 years. In the last three years she has produced this and an earlier collection of short stories - \\"Tales from Earthsea\\" - and a novel - \\"The Other Wind\\" - very nearly as delightful as this collection. If she wrote in the so-called \\"mainstream\\" genre, she'd have a stack of Pulitzers by now. But it is our luck she hangs with us in the science fiction ghetto, and graces us with tales like these.<br />If the last line of \\"Unchosen Love\\" doesn't make you blink back tears; if the grace of the first paragraph of the title story doesn't astound you; well, we must not like the same kind of literature.

And, he reasons, any limits on that ability violate the First Amendment.<br />Let's pause and note that even the Rehnquist court has not gone this far. And let's reflect on how we acquired out present president - a ton of Republican money and his daddy's name. I first saw this happen in Alaska, where I happen to live, when Mike Gravel defeated Ernest Gruening by the simple expedient of purchasing saturation advertising in the last four weeks of the campaign. Gruening, a true statesman, was defeated by a man whose apparent goal as U.S. Senator was to amass enough wealth to assure himself re-election in the next campaign. I'd argue that the triumph of the Gravels over the Gruenings has bought us the government we have today.<br />To argue that the process cannot be controlled, it seems to me, is to argue that our government pretty much belongs to the highest bidder. Prof. Redish, without ever squarely addressing it, argues either there is no link between campaign contributions and influence, or that the influence is perfectly acceptable. I don't believe that our Founding Fathers would agree with either alternative.<br />Prof. Redish makes a forceful argument, and I can only hope he is wrong. This book will have influence - I'm sure it was written for the purpose - with the Rehnquist court and its successors. Which is too bad. Whatever your views, if you care about our government or the future of the country, you should read this book.e about our government or the future of the country, you should read this book.	2002-07-23

In a world of nanotech, artificial sentience and customized genese, what's really important?<br />Hamilton doesn't dodge the Big Questions in \\"Fallen Dragon.\\" The book intertwines four stories: Lawrence Newton as adult, a pirate for a multi-national, interstellar corporation that engages in colonial piracy at an interstellar scale; the same Lawrence Newton as a youth, a child of the ruling class in one of those colonies, obsessed with interstellar exploration; Denise, a colonist on another planet, who tells children the most amazing stories and may or may not be more than she seems; and Simon Roderick, a director of the the corporate pirates that employ Newton. Each has a different view of his or her universe, each has a different set of goals and each has a different set of means to those goals. Who's right and what's right are the heart of this story, as well as what's a legitimate way to pursue those goals.<br />Hamilton's concept of multi-national corporations whose shareholder return is based on a eumphemistic \\"asset realization\\" - simple piracy - of interstellar colonies is plausible, and has precedent in the British East india Company. The development choices made by the colonists on each of the colonies Newton visits to loot are imaginative; the colony of Santo Christo is especially interesting. \\"Skin\\" is the next obvious step after the armor in Heinlein's \\"Starship Troopers.\\" And Hamilton does a nice job of tying the various plots together at the end, in a climax somewhat reminiscent of Iain M. Bank's \\"Use of Weapons.\\"<br />On the other hand, the lengthy expository sections, as other reviewers have noted, do bog the story down somewhat, and could have used some editing. It's not clear to me what the purpose of the extended steamy sex scenes is, either.<br />Still and all, the story works, and works at several levels. Hamilton slyly hides a few cards until the last few pages, incuding the reason why Newton, apparently improbably, shifts sides near the end of the book, after hearing the story of Modrik. And I liked the ambiguity of the ending: you can't really be sure which solution is the \\"right solution,\\" and perhaps there is neither a right solution nor a single right solution to the intractable problems that afflict mankind. Less palatable is Hamilton's implication that the only true virtue is selfishness.<br />But it's a good yarn, and well told. Recommended, with a caution that it may be dangerous to skim the tedious parts.ides a few cards until the last few pages, incuding the reason why Newton, apparently improbably, shifts sides near the end of the book, after hearing the story of Modrik.

Vlad is a mob member and an assassin, as well as a member of a racial minority, in a complex and deeply dysfunctional society.<br />Dragaera is a world where very long-lived elves wielding powerful sorcery, short-lived humans, a host of other intelligent species and even gods exist in a uneasy, unhappy state of intermittent war and uneasy peace. Vlad lives in a part of the world where the elves rule, and his people, for the most part, live in squalid slums. He takes his hatred for his oppressors and turns it into a career, and assassinates elves at the behest of other elves. He becomes a minor mob boss in the Jhereg, the criminal underground operated by the elves. All of this is accepted behavior in Brusts vividly imagined world.<br />Yet as the two novels in this book show,  Vlad's best friends are all among his oppressors. He may loath the Dragaerans in general, but he comes to value them individually as friends and colleagues. Cynical and noble, murderous and ethical, cold-blooded and warm-hearted; he is a mass of contradictions and yet a self-consistent whole.<br />In addition to a fascinating protagonist set is an complex world, Brust experiments with literary forms. Whether its a homage to Dumas  as in \\"The Phoenix Guards\\" and \\"Five Hundred Years Later\\"  or interlocked chronologies as in \\"Taltos\\" in this volume, he uses those techniques to inform his narrative. Brust is a fine writer, with a nice sense of irony and narrative structure.<br />Finally, the stories here are a part of the evolving story of the puzzle that is Vlad Taltos. If you enjoy this book, you should also read \\"The Book of Jhereg,\\" an earlier collection of Vlad Taltos novels.<br />I enjoy the Vlad Taltos stories very much; I think you will too.	2002-03-28

We live in a credulous society, a culture that seems to be incapable of critical thinking. That's an extremely dangerous situation. When a majority of U.S. citizens believe in astrology; when a voter can read a newspaper expose' on dial up fortune-telling scams and then dial a 900 number in order to decide what to do; well, it doesn't bode well for our country.<br />To some extent, Sagan oversold himself in the late 1980's and early 1990's. His eager sincerity was even parodied - &quot;billyuns and billyuns - but he was an engaging science writer and popularizer. In this book he stepped a bit outside of that usual role, and made some critical and important points about our culture. No thoughtful citizen can read this book, look around and fail to be concerned.<br />I'd make this book required reading, not for students, but for school board members and teachers. If the average citizen is credulous to the point of embarrassment - and that's pretty clearly the case - the solution has to involve the educational system, and especially those in charge. We are not teaching our citizens and future citizens to think critically. In Sagan's phrase, &quot;Extravagant claims require extravagant evidence.&quot; For better or worse, the life of the world is logic, and the ability to reason is as important as the ability to read and the ability to do arithmetic. And if you think it's not a problem, you need to read this book, or just attend the public comments portion of a school board meeting, or read the letters to the editor in your newspaper.<br />You should read this book. You should act on the message of this book.  Not just because it is a thoughtful, entertaining treatment of an important issue. But because that issue hasn't gone away; and it seems to be getting worse.	2002-03-28

Sibley and Kauffman have both published very good guides recently, serious competition for the venerable National Geographic guide.<br />First, you can't go wrong with any of the three. They are all very good, although each brings different strengths and weaknesses.<br />Second, if you bird with a companion, carry different guides: one of you take National Geographic and one of you take Sibley or Kauffman.<br />Third, measure your skill level against the assumptions of the various guides. If you are a novice, then Kauffman might be your best choice. If you are a beginner who has a bit of experience, then National Geo may be your best choice. If you are an advanced beginner or better, then perhaps Sibley.<br />But as an overall choice, with decent art (although not quite as good as Sibley), decent identification highlights (although not quite as good as Kauffman), quite good behavior cues, excellent treatment of vagrant birds and highly readable text, National Geographic emerges as the most versatile of the three.<br />If you can, get all three. If you can't get all three, this is probably, by the thinnest of margins, the best choice.	2002-01-12

They were Changed, and learned to think, to talk and, later on, to develop a conscience. They named themselves after things they saw in the rubbish, perhaps a little before they knew what the words meant. Pratchett is a good enough writer that rats like Dangerous Beans, Peaches, Darktan, Hamnpork and Donut Enter are a lot more vivid and believable than 9/10ths of what passes for literature today.<br />Maurice is a cat, and he is also Changed, although he really doesn't like to talk about how it happened. But he's always careful now to ask his food if it can talk before her eats it. He's the brains behind the scam.<br />Together with the stupid-looking kid who plays the flute - his name is really Keith - the rats and Maurice work the pied piper scam. For a modest fee, Keith can get rid of the sudden plague of rats that afflicts a town. And what with rats widdling in the flour and tap-dancing on the kitchen counter - there's always someone who wants to be in theater - the town is always grateful when Keith successfully pipes the rats away.<br />Until they arrive at the town of Bad Blintz. The traps are worse, the poisons more lethal and the rat catchers more ingenious than anywhere else. And there is something really evil living lower down, under the rat tunnels. Something that hates. Something that takes you over.<br />Pratchett has called this a children's book, but it would be more accurate to say it was based on a children's book. It's really about myths and the role of myths, and what it means to be \\"human.\\" As just one example, the rats drag along with them a collection of children's fairy tales, remarkably like Peter Rabbit, and think it's a reference book for humans. The Pied Piper of Hamlin, of course, is itself a fairy tale. With (or perhaps despite) the \\"help\\" of Malicia, the Mayor's daughter and the granddaughter and grand niece of the Sisters Grim, the rats, Maurice and the stupid-looking kid must learn the hard way that if you aren't making up your own story, then you're just a character in someone else's.<br />Fun and thought-provoking, if somewhat different than the usual Pratchett novel.

The distortions are both amusing - sometimes hysterically funny - and thought-provoking. Sometimes the reflection is barely recognizable, and sometimes it is so close to ours that it cuts like a knife. His logic is rigorous, but skewed, and the twists reveal a great deal about the assumptions we make every day.<br />This is a quintessential police procedural novel, as reflected by Pratchett's mirror, combined with a Frankenstein theme. Instead of detectives and police, we have the Night Watch. Commander Sam Vimes is a classic recovering drunk and Sergeant Colon is fat and lazy - recognizable as stock characters; but another cop is a female werewolf with pre-lunar tension, the captain is a six foot, six inch human who thinks he is a dwarf, a third is a troll and the forensics expert is an out of the closet dwarf trying to get in touch with her feminine side.<br />Someone has killed two old men, and someone is trying to poison the Patrician, the closest thing the city of Ankh-Morpork has to a ruler. The suspects appear to be golems, the artificial men of Hebrew mythology, but golems can't kill. Golems are the perfect slave, only able to do the things they are told, the &quot;words in their head.&quot; And how is it that Corporal Nobby Nobbs, a constable who carries a certificate establishing he is probably human, can be the long-lost Earl of Ankh and the heir apparent to the throne?<br />All these plot threads and more come together in the finest Pratchett tradition, in one of his best and most satisfying conclusions. Women have their biggest roles yet in a Night Watch novel, and the complex relationship between the Patrician and Sam Vimes continues to evolve. It's only later, when you think about what happened to the golems, that you recognize the reflection of our world and the important messages Pratchett is conveying.<br />The humor and satire are present in abundance. The scene in which three thieves try to hold up the Night Watch's favorite bar and, worse still, try to use Constable Angua as a hostage, is simply delightful. Pratchett's skills with dialog and characterization are in fine form. But it's the messages that occur to you afterwards that make the novel truly memorable, and make this book, in Captain Carrot's phrase, &quot;seriously prod buttock.&quot;<br />Great fun; highly recommended.he humor and satire are present in abundance.

Whether it is silly science, silly premises or silly characters, Gardner's writing repeatedly runs the risk of losing its audience to disbelief. Which is a shame because the writing itself isn't that bad.<br />When Gardner keeps the operating rules of his dubious universe away from the central focus, the stories do better; &quot;Vigilant,&quot; for example, as compared to &quot;Hunted.&quot; But in this most recent book, Gardner sets out to explore the roots of his universe and the flaws, inconsistencies and other goobers are out there on plain display.<br />Oar, the glass woman left for dead in &quot;Expendable,&quot; turns out to be very much alive, although why and how are at the heart of this new story. And this new story is told from the point of view of Oar. Which is more complicated than it might seem. Oar is the last conscious member of a re-engineered subspecies of homo sap., given immortal bodies by alien species unknown, which bodies, in addition to being nearly indestructible, are as transparent as glass. Since Oar is a knockout, this gives the folks who do the book covers a certain licentious freedom... But Oar's people got shortchanged: in return for the facile learning skills of a child, they also got &quot;Tired Brain Syndrome,&quot; which causes them to go into a near-coma before age 50. And Oar is approaching that deadly age. Remember I warned you about silly science...<br />In this continuation of the events of &quot;Expendable&quot; and the culmination of &quot;Hunted,&quot; and in particular the death of Admiral York, the misdeeds of both the Council of Admirals that governs the human worlds and some shady aliens are all threatened with exposure. Oar, who is in many ways a self-centered, arrogant child, is chased or harassed by seemingly most of the intelligent species in the universe.<br />The story works, despite the silly premises and slippery science, because Gardner does write well, and conveys the story from Oar's point of view quite well. Once again we see Festina Ramos, the character that links all the stories, from the view of another person. And certain parts of the story work pretty well.<br />If you bring any skepticism or critical thinking to Gardner's series, you may not enjoy these books. But if you are willing to take it as it comes, and bring the kind of accepting attitude that was the requirement for Golden Age science fiction, then this is a good yarn and good fun. Nothing special, perhaps, but still a bit above the usual fodder cranked out over the last few years.gant child, is chased or harassed by seemingly most of the intelligent species in the universe.<br />The story works, despite the silly premises and slippery science, because Gardner does write well, and conveys the story from Oar's point of view quite well.

Niven and Pournelle have written some of the best science fiction and fantasy there is. I share the late Robert Heinlein's opinion that &quot;The Mote in God's Eye&quot; might be the finest single &quot;pure&quot; science fiction novel ever written. It's an unsurpassed First Contact novel. &quot;Footfall&quot; is an excellent &quot;alien invasion&quot; book. Even &quot;Inferno,&quot; which marked Niven's descent into extended travel brochures instead of novels, was fun.<br />This novel is set in Niven's &quot;The Magic Goes Away&quot; universe and, boy, has the magic gone away. There is little in the story to recommend. The society in which events occur is implausible. The flaws that underpin &quot;mana&quot; as a limited resource for magic stand out like Las Vegas neon. The rigrous logic and plot development that used to be the mark of Niven and Pournelle's work is mostly missing. You may not believe this, but the book is difficult to read. Ponderous and polemic by turns; it's a serious disappointment.<br />I think I'll re-read &quot;Mote&quot; to get the taste of this out of my mouth and restore my high opinion of these authors.	2001-12-18

The Companions select and assist Heralds, who are the government's agents in the field and very nearly incorruptible. Since the first Valdemar trilogy, the &quot;Arrows&quot; books, the Herald Skif, a reformed thief, has popped up from time to time, sometimes in minor roles, sometimes in larger ones, as in the &quot;Winds&quot; trilogy.<br />In her last two Valedmar books, Lackey has abandoned the development of Valdemar and focused instead on specific characters. In &quot;Brightly Burning&quot; it was an historical character, mentioned only in passing in other novels. This time it's a somewhat larger character, although still just a &quot;spear carrier,&quot; an important but not a central character.<br />Anne McCaffrey, whose Pern is in some ways similar to the Valdemar books, in &quot;Masterharper of Pern,&quot; did something similar. She took a &quot;spear carrier&quot; who had appeared in many books and wrote his history. And she noted somewhere, perhaps in the introduction, how hard it is to bring off right. One the one hand, it's pleasant to wander through the fringes of earlier stories, recognizing bits and pieces; on the other hand, you absolutely know how it is all going to come out, and the possibilities for inconsistencies are very great.<br />Lackey does an okay job with the inconsistencies. Reviewers who note apparent problems with the naming of Companions Haven't Been Paying Attention... A few do creep in, but they are minor. And Lackey manages to sneak in a great deal of information about Alberich, the exile from Valdemar's enemy who became a Herald, and about what really happened when Queen Selenay was attacked by her husband.<br />But it's hard to walk through the very considerable amount Lackey has written about Valdemar and its history, develop any kind of plot suspense, and not baffle readers new to the series.<br />While it's nice to have a new Valdemar book, I'm looking forward to a return to the larger themes of the &quot;Winds&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot; series, as opposed to the less interesting, less imaginative character studies and personal histories in the &quot;Owl&quot; series, in &quot;Brightly Burning&quot; and now in &quot;Take a Thief.&quot;<br />Overall this is a good yarn. It's nice to wander the fringes of earlier stories - the &quot;Arrow&quot; series in particular - and to see Alberich at his devious best. You can feel Ms. Lackey's wonderful powers of imagination at work, but can also see how they are bound by what she has written before. It doesn't seriously distract from the tale, but it's much less captivating than the &quot;Arrows&quot; and &quot;Winds&quot; series, and far below her peak in the &quot;Magic&quot; trilogy.<br />Recommended, but not recommended as Lackey's best.ffle readers new to the series.<br />While it's nice to have a new Valdemar book, I'm looking forward to a return to the larger themes of the &quot;Winds&quot; and &quot;Storm&quot; series, as opposed to the less interesting, less imaginative character studies and personal histories in the &quot;Owl&quot; series, in &quot;Brightly Burning&quot; and now in &quot;Take a Thief.&quot; <br />Overall this is a good yarn.

With all respect to my fellow reviewers, it might be a tad bit arrogant to dismiss such a book as &quot;puerile.&quot;<br />Before Kuhn, we were taught in school that scientific progress was linear, that it was an unending progression of refinements and developments, with one &quot;truth&quot; leading to the next &quot;truth.&quot; Kuhn's insights including pointing out that such a linear progression was mostly a lie. His thesis was that the major developments in science were mostly revolutionary. That some &quot;truths&quot; turned out to be false. Astronomy was revolutionized by Galielo and Copernicus, and man was divested from the center of the universe. Physics was revolutionized by Newton. Biology and Darwin. It didn't hurt that plate tectonics came along shortly after Kuhn published, and Kuhn looked like his model was predictive, too.<br />Part of Kuhn's impact, I have to admit, was a result of the time which the book was first published. In the middle and late 1960's, questioning authority was the heart of any undergraduate's thinking, and Kuhn's ideas were read by some as a license to question all authority.<br />Perhaps as a consequence, Kuhn's model has been carried by other writers beyond all reason, with everyone from sociologists to New Age fuzzies usurping his terminology, making &quot;paradigm shift&quot; a nearly instant cliche. But his influence has gone far beyond those who want to mis-apply his ideas to everything from post-modern dance to sociobiology. Uniformitarianism has been bloodied, perhaps permanently. By geologists, evolutionists, archaeologists and more; the influence has been pervasive and real. Stephen Jay Gould may or may not subscribe to &quot;Structure,&quot; but he has sure demolished uniformitarianism in evolution.<br />I disagree with those who regard &quot;Structure&quot; as &quot;the most important&quot; anything. But it unquestionably has been stunningly influential, and any serious student of science or philosphy, I believe, will be reading this book a hundred years from now.

The disease decimated the Oolom population with whom humanity shares Demoth. The human minority suffered psychological trauma as it watched millions of Ooloms die. The protagonist, Faye Smallwood, suffered as much as anyone. Gardner's description of Faye's response to the illness and eventual death of one Oolom is particularly well-drawn. It was Faye's father, in fact, who found the cure in something as prosaic as olive oil, but only after the Oolom Faye admired and loved had died.<br />Eventually, Faye put the trauma behind her, becoming a member of the Vigil, Demoth's unique supra-governmental auditors and monitors. But her first assignment is a disaster. She narrowly escapes death; seven of her fellow members of the Vigil are killed. Faye escapes, in part, because of a peacock-like creature of light. And that narrow escape plummets her into an interplanetary plot with too many players, and an ancient, evil war that is still going on. With the help of Festina Ramos, the sensible heroine of &quot;Expendable,&quot; she solves the nested mysteries and saves Demoth and its peoples.<br />This is a much better book than &quot;Expendable,&quot; Gardner's first book. In particular, the plotting is far better and the mystery at the core of the story is much better conceived. Gardner's insistence on the implausible stupidity, corruption and arrogance of Earth's governing Council of Admirals is annoying, but not as critical to the story as it was in &quot;Expendable&quot; (and will be in &quot;Hunted&quot;).<br />A good read, with clever plotting. Recommended.	2001-11-01

Or at least he thinks he is. He's a failed clone. His &quot;sister,&quot; Samantha, has all the brains. At age 20, she's ambassador to Troyen.<br />Troyen is a hive, with castes evolved to respond to pheromones. But while Samantha is ambassador, it collapses into a messy civil war. Samantha and the Queen are killed, and Edward spends the next 20 years on one of Troyen's moons, watching the only place he ever called home devolve into chaos. When a ship finally picks him up to take him home, disaster ensues when the League kills everyone aboard the spacecraft but Edward under its unfailing rule: nonsentients - persons who kill or assist in killing - are forbidden from interstellar space.<br />Edward is plunged into an interstellar consiparacy involving half a dozen races. With the help of Festina Ramos, he tries to grope through the cloud of conspiracies around him. In the process, he learns that everything he thought he knew is a lie, and that the biggest lies he has been told were about himself.<br />Once again, Gardner paints Earth's government as utterly corrupt. It's the least plausible part of the story, worse even than the idea of human pheromones. But despite that ongoing flaw, this is a very good book. It's hard to make a dumb protagonist credible, but Gardner brings it off. The plot twists are as good as &quot;Vigilant.&quot; Gardner continues to improve as a writer.<br />Recommended.	2001-11-01

Like a lot of first books, it has some good ideas, some bad ideas and some mediocre execution.<br />The Technocracy is a good idea. A galaxy wide, fairly informal organization, it encompasses civilizations so advanced as to be omnipotent. Earth is a very junior member. There's only one unalterable rule in the Technocracy: non-sentient species, defined as a species that kills, aren't permitted to travel beyond their system. If they try, they are killed, with no more compunction than we'd swat a mosquito.<br />Explorers are a good idea, they are brave, intelligent scouts on new planets, with physical defects that make their inescapably high mortality rates politically acceptable. I'm not sure I buy the premise, but at least it's a new idea.<br />Melaquin, the &quot;dumping ground&quot; for the Earth's political hot potatoes, is a bad idea, and the corruptness, incompetence and stupidity of the Earth's governing body is a genuinely dumb idea.<br />Still, the good carries the bad, and overall this is a good read. Gardner's later books, featuring much the same cast of characters, are better. Festina Ramos, the protagonist here, is a far more interesting person in &quot;Vigilant&quot; and &quot;Hunted,&quot; two of the later books.<br />Gardner bears watching. If he continues to improve, he could be a genuinely new voice in science fiction.	2001-11-01

Since I discovered &quot;The River Why&quot; 15 years ago, I have shared the sheer delight of his writing with everyone who would listen.<br />This time Duncan chooses nonfiction. Part autobiography, part conservation plea, part apology and part explanation, he is always articulate and passionate. Take his explanation for the importance of the endangered Stillwater Marsh on the Truckee River:<br />&quot;Let me stress the Stillwater's importance in a storyteller's way:<br />&quot;Imagine running in one of the great American marathons. Or, if you're in the kind of shape I'm in, imagine jogging, then walking, and in the end possibly crawling to the finish line of an American marathon. Whatever your condition, by the time you reached the finish line you'd be in dire need of fluids, food and rest. Stillwater Marsh - for waterfowl and shorebirds enduring the marathon we call migration - is one such finish line. But now imagine that, after giving your all for twenty-six miles, you're greeted by a sign that reads:<br />&quot;SORRY. WE'RE FRESH OUT OF FLUIDS, FOOD AND REST AREAS HERE. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RUN ANOTHER TWENTY-SIX MILES TO ANOTHER FINISH LINE. MAYBE THEY CAN HELP YOU THERE.&quot;<br />We've all read of the importance of wildlife refuges. Duncan puts it in terms that any high school athlete can understand. Self-deprecating, faintly amusing, but crystal clear. Passionate but not shrill.<br />But this book is more than an exceptionally articulate set of essays in support of conservation. It's also a glimpse into the personal life of the author. Few autobiographers can be honest and complete. Katherine Graham comes to mind. Even fewer authors. From his youth, to his first book, to his reasons for leaving his beloved Oregon coast, to his move to Montana. It's all laid out with painful honesty.<br />I wish Duncan would write more. &quot;The Brothers K&quot; and &quot;River Teeth&quot; were a long time coming. But &quot;My Story as Told by Water&quot; was worth the wait.;My Story as Told by Water&quot; was worth the wait.	2001-10-13

Have you ever read a book where you were at the edge of laughter and tears on the same page? You can.<br />Le Guin has taken the loose ends of her four earlier Earthsea novels and her recent collection of Earthsea short stories, combined those loose ends and your favorite characters from them with some serious thinking on the life and death, and created the finest Earthsea story to date.<br />Alder is a &quot;mender,&quot; a repairer of broken pots, a mere sorcerer, one who should never see the low wall that only wizards know, the wall that separates the living from the dead. Yet the wall and the dead torment his sleep. The dead call to him, asking to be set free and, most shockingly of all, his dead wife has kissed him across the wall of stones, something unknown in the history of Earthsea. The Patterner, one of the eight great wizards of Roke, the wizard's isle, has sent Alder to Ged. And while Ged may have lost his power of wizardry and be done with doing, his heart goes out to the tormented young man. He counsels him, finds him a temporary solution to his nightmares, and sends him to Havnor, to the King Lebannen. For Ged thinks that Alder may herald a change for Earthsea, one even greater than those Ged wrought.<br />Alder meets other characters in his quest. Some are old friends of the reader: Tenar, from &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; and &quot;Tehanu;&quot; Tehanu herself, who is somehow the daughter of Kalessin, the eldest dragon; Lebannen, the young king from &quot;The Farthest Shore.&quot; Some are acquaintances from &quot;Tales from Earthsea,&quot; most notably Irian, now Orm Irian. Others are new but no less wonderful: the young princess of the Kargish lands and, of course, Alder himself.<br />Le Guin takes these characters, let's them grow and age, shows us time's marks upon them, and brings them into Alder's life and Alder's quest. And as Alder's quest grows beyond himself, to involve the living and the dead, indeed all the souls of Earthsea, so does the book's sense of wonder. Until, like Ged, in the moment just before the climax of the story, we will smile a little because like him we like that pause, &quot;that fearful pause, the moment before things change.&quot;<br />This is a masterly work, not just because of the clever use of characters or the wonderful plotting, but also because of the depth of the thinking that lies beyond and inside the story. It's about even more than life or death; it's also about the things we assume and take for granted because they have always been so, without ever asking if they are truly right. Alder's love for his dead wife has the power to change the world. What's no less wonderful is Le Guin's power to move the reader, to challenge and provoke us.<br />Read and savor this book.

Eliot's 1922 landmark poem, &quot;The Wasteland.&quot; The full text of lines 325-326:<br />Gentile or jew,<br />O you who turn the wheel and look to windward, Consider Phlebas, who was once handsome and tall as you.<br />Those familiar with Banks' work will immediately recognize the two words immediately following &quot;look to windward&quot; as the title of another Banks' Culture novel. What's going on here?<br />Not every SF author can get away with titling his books from one of the 20th century's greatest poems. A lot of them have the chutzpah, but can't bring their word craft up to their pretensions. Banks can. While _Look to Windward_ doesn't have the machine gun pacing or extraordinary violence of earlier Banks' works, it does offer remarkably good writing, generally good characterization, and a further display of Banks' astonishing imaginative powers. Masaq' Orbital and its billions of residents are seeing the supernovae from suns destroyed by the Idirans near the end of the Idiran War 800 years earlier. The Mind - the self-aware AI that runs Masaq' was a fighter in that war. Billions died, some at the hand of that Mind. More recently, Special Circumstances, The Culture's meddling, would-be uplifters of the disadvantaged, had another of their surreptitious interventions go horribly wrong, and 5 billion Chelgrians died. Look to windward, indeed. Masaq' Orbital's Mind has commissioned Ziller, an expatriate Chelgrian, to compose a symphony for the occasion of the second supernova. In the meantime, the Chelgrians have sent Major Quilan, a veteran of the civil wars triggered by The Culture, to Masaq', ostensibly to persuade Ziller to return to his home world. The real reason is more horrific: the destruction of the Mind that runs Masaq'. Major Quilan and the Chelgrians who support his have the help of mysterious benefactors, demonstrating, perhaps, that The Culture is still its own worst enemy.<br />In Major Quilan, Banks has created his most memorable character of The Culture novels. Tormented, ambivalent, manipulated and empathetic, he stands in stark contrast to the indulgent and snobbish, if immensely talented, Ziller. By seeing two very different Chelgrians, we better understand them and the reactions of those around them.<br />As in any Banks novel, there are surprises galore, and it is next to impossible to identify the goods guys or the bad guys. Don't expect the slam-bang excitement of _Consider Phelbas_ or the pacing of _Excession_. This is a novel of revenge. But as Eliot was at pains to point out in &quot;The Wasteland,&quot;<br />PHLEBAS the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,<br />Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep seas swell<br />And the profit and loss.<br />A current under sea<br />Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell<br />He passed the stages of his age and youth<br />Entering the whirlpool.<br />Death cares not at all for the minor victories of life. One death is no more or less than a dozen or 5 billion. Major Quilan's willingness - zeal - to die, sadly mirrored in the front pages of today's news, is ultimately futile, as Banks warns us from the very title of this novel.<br />This is a very good book, literate without pretension. Highly recommended.y.<br />In Major Quilan, Banks has created his most memorable character of The Culture novels.

I'll excuse the grammar errors, the awkward dialog and the clumsy characterization. But even a beginning author can develop a plot that is tight, and Mr. Stackpole doesn't. At the risk of a spoiler, to pick just one, how can only one Talion know of &quot;nekkhets&quot;? Did the Master send Marana to kill the nekkhet without telling her what it was? Nolan's identification of the traitor in the climactic scene is based on an impossible premise.<br />The rigorous training that all Talions must go through, in the case of Justices almost from birth, somehow fails disastrously in not one but two cases? Three if you count Ring? And this is the force that holds the remnants of the Shattered Empire together?<br />And don't get me started on authors who don't reveal or even give us a clue about critical secrets like Nolan's heritage until after it's necessary to the plot... Talk about inventing yourself out of a corner...<br />Again, I know this is a first novel, but plots are what rookies are supposed to get right.<br />There's been very good fantasy written over the last 25 years. Barry Hughart's _Bridge of Birds_, Ursula LeGuin's early books, Jack Vance's _Lyonesse_ trilogy, among many others. _Talion: Revenant_, despite some nice ideas, is derivative, logically inconsistent and seriously flawed. Not a classic. Not even a keeper.	2001-08-23

Morgenstern's Classic Tale of True Love and High Adventure (The 25th Anniversary Edition)	Books	3	10	19	N	N	Pay No Attention to the Man Behind the Curtain	Goldman wasn't content to write a fairy tale. But he couldn't decide whether to write a satire, a parody or a pastiche. So the tone of this story wanders around as he tries to do them all. You get the impression that this is an author who smirks at himself when he walks by a mirror.<br />Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of wonderful invention here. The movie, made much later, chose the straight romantic fairy tale for the most part, with only Billy Crystal as Miracle Max sounding a sardonic note. The book wanders from tone to tone. True romance here, irony there, recurring satire scattered about and &quot;wink wink nudge&quot; parody when the narrative sags.<br />The book is okay, but I found the clash in tones very distracting and the air of condescension annoying. Terry Pratchett can write parody without sounding smug; Goldman could not.<br />Some of the ideas Goldman brought to the book are quite good. Everything we really know about Westley, for example, we learn from seeing him defeat seemingly invincible villains. That's new and interesting. But then Goldman undercuts his good efforts with another elbow in our ribs telling us not to take any of this seriously. It left me wishing he'd please make up his mind.<br />See the movie; skip the book.	2001-08-17

But either way, this is a fine addition to the literature of The Culture.<br />If you have read as far as this, you already know that there is something called &quot;The Culture,&quot; and that is it a fantasically developed, ultra-powerful, galaxy wide entity which, in the name of Good, meddles in the affairs of other, more primitive societies, through its &quot;Special Circumstances&quot; arm. There are, shall we say, signs that &quot;Special Circumstances&quot; is at work on the multiply-sunned, multiply-mooned world on which this story takes place.<br />And this is a Culture novel, make no mistake, but this time we see Special Circumstances from the other side, most poignantly from the eyes of Oelph, the apprentice to and spy upon the co-protagonist, Dr. Vossil. Dr. Vossil is a woman and a foreigner in what is a deeply misogynistic, seriously provincial society. Through her surprising talents as a healer, she has become the personal physician to a king. Her co-protagonist is DeWar, the personal bodyguard to a regicide and usurper in another kingdom. Both &quot;kingdoms&quot; are fragments of a larger, even sicker culture that was destroyed not long before the events of this story when rocks fells from the sky. Hmm...<br />The stories of DeWar and Dr. Vossil are intertwined, but this is a Banks novel and you have to read carefuly to understand exactly how and why. The &quot;Inversions&quot; of the title are present at many levels, just as the story operates at many levels. Admire, if you will, the way the drawing of the dagger inverts at the start of each chapter. Listen carefully to the stories that DeWar tells Lattens, the child and heir of the man DeWar tries to protect. Watch as DeWar and Lattens play at war with catapaults and rocks. Try, if you can, to pick out who will betray whom, and when, and why. Try to decide who is the evil, scheming tyrant and who is Good. And try to decide whether, for once, Special Circumstances has actually done some good...<br />As always, Banks leaves us with a morally ambiguous ending, although in this case the ambiguity is at many levels.<br />An excellent, thought-provoking book.

Artist, philosopher, politician, utopian and, as this marvelous book demonstrates, epic romanticist. The Well at the World's End was very nearly the first of its kind, an epic romance filled with magic, intrigue, guile, love, sex and long journeys to strange places. Plainly, these are the elements of three-quarters of modern fantasy. But Morris did it first, and he did it very, very well (sorry).<br />Ralph of Upmeads is the youngest son of a king. The king of a very small, but very real kingdom. He runs away, but as he runs away his godmother gives him a simple necklace with a bead on it. And, all unknowingly, his path is then destined to the Well at the World's End. Along the way he has adventures that have since been copied or simply stolen by Robert Jordan, Terry Goodkind, Mercedes Lackey and most everyone else. But Morris did it first.<br />Joseph Campbell, who wrote about and understood heroic fantasy very well, to my knowledge never mentioned Morris, but he would recognize Ralph of Upmeads at once. Ralph overcomes tragedy (&quot;He must needs bend the bow&quot;) and the loss of his first true love, to triumph in the spirit, in love, and in military heroics.<br />Morris affects a kind of Old English language style, very archaic even when he wrote it, but after a few pages it becomes part of the tone of the story and lends greatly to the atmosphere that Morris was trying to create. There are truly harrowing scenes in this book, but Morris's writing carries them off very well and, perhaps, even more effectively because of the language he uses.<br />The inventiveness is wonderful - superior to the majority of what you can find today - and the plotting is intricate without being confusing. Some of the characters are archetypes, but others are simply delightful. Bull Nosy and Ursula, in particular, are memorable and exceptionally well developed. And the protagonist, Ralph, a lad that all women must look upon with love, is one of the great characters in fantasy.<br />This book and one or two others Morris wrote have had an indelible and profound impact on the fantasy genre. If you want to escape the formulaic fantasy writing the fills the shelves today, join Ralph on his quest for the Well at the World's End. Drink, with Ralph, from one of the seminal books in Anglo-American literature.ith love, is one of the great characters in fantasy.<br />This book and one or two others Morris wrote have had an indelible and profound impact on the fantasy genre.

While even absolute beginners will appreciate Mr. Sibley's exquisite watercolors, this is primarily a visual reference and not a how-to-do-it key. Birds are in taxonomic order, and there is serious discussion and depiction of races within a species, something that will baffle novices. Beginners would be better served with the National Geographic Guide of Kenn Kauffman's new book.<br />But for intermediate and advanced birders, or for serious beginners, this is a nearly perfect guide. In particular, I found the pages showing all of the flycatchers on one page, or all of the woodpeckers, or all of the small gulls, to be exceptionally well done. For the treatment of individual species, well, in most cases, you will only find better drawings in the specialty books. I'd be proud to hang any of Sibley's 6,000 or more watercolors depcited in this book on my wall at home.<br />It's larger than a traditional field guide, but not so large that you can't lug it along in the field. Other reviews imply it's the size of an unabridged encyclopedia; in fact, it's about half again the size of the National Geographic guide.<br />A few quibbles:<br /> - Stay away from the first printing. There seems to have been a problem with the color. The color quality (and accuracy) is much better in second and subsequent printings.<br /> - Some of the unusual birds, the rarities, are omitted. This spring it was my pleasure to watch a Eurasian Bullfinch. It's a bird that's in National Geographic, but not in Sibley. I'm told Sibley stayed with the birds he knew. Perhaps that's the explanation.<br /> - To the extent behavior is used in identifying birds - Empidonax flycatchers, for example - it's probably not described sufficiently.<br />But these are truly quibbles. Overall this is a remarkable piece of work and already a classic in its field. There isn't yet a Perfect Birding Guide but David Sibley's work is as close as anyone has come.'s work is as close as anyone has come.	2001-07-13

Part of its charm is its depth; each of the principal characters is revealed in each successive book as having more complexity, history and motivation; The protagonist, Vlad Taltos, is both revealed and discovers more about himself and the society in which he lives.<br />Dragaeran society, as I have noted in another review, is deeply dysfunctional. The world is populated by an extravagant number of species, and has equally extravagant amounts of sorcery. It's a world of many mysteries, ranging from the origins of Vlad himself to the origins of the world itself. A number of those myteries get cleared up in _Issola_.<br />For long-time fans, if you think Vlad got himself in a jam in _Dragon_, fighting as a foot soldier, it's even worse here. Vlad is still on the lam, hiding from the Jhereg who are trying to kill him. He's still separated from his wife. And he doesn't even know he has a son yet. Lady Teldra, hostess of Castle Black, tracks him down to report that his friends Morrollan and Aleira, have vanished. He tracks them down, and discovers that they and he are prisoners of the semi-mythical Jenoine, the mysterious creatures who created Dragaerans, the race of elves, and not incidentally the Great Sea of Chaos that powers the sorcery of the world.<br />As Vlad figures out the true relationships - or at least the relationships at this level - among the humans, Dragaerans, gods and Jenoine, and the role of sorcery and the Great Weapons his friends possess, he finds himself unavoidably drawn into an apocalyptic battle with his friends on one side, allied with the gods themselves, and the Jenoine on the other.<br />This book is very much a sequel. It's filled with references to earlier stories and events. While I suppose a first-time reader might enjoy it, it will make a great deal more sense and be a lot more fun if you have read at least a few of the earlier 8 books in the series. I'd suggest _Jhereg_, _Taltos_ and _Dragon_ for starters.<br />Brust has experimented in recent books in the Taltos series, trying different narrative voices and different styles. This book is a return to the straight ahead, first person narrative of the early books. While the experiments were interesting, I think Vlad is best understood by being in Vlad's head. It helps the story's flow immensely.<br />There are still many mysteries to be explained, and enough plot threads lying around to support another eight stories. Keep up the excellent work, Mr. Brust.

Keep up the excellent work, Mr. Brust. Existing fans of Vlad Taltos, this is book is a rare treat. New readers, you may be a bit bewildered until you catch up, but you'll have fun.	2001-07-08
US	52229435	R10UTR1ZTXDKLR	0345321383	932766552	Bridge of Birds: A Novel of an Ancient China That Never Was	Books	5	55	57	N	Y	The best book you've never read	This is truly an extraordinary book, every bit as good as most reviewers have found it. It is something between a fairy tale, a fantasy and an epic. The story has a timeless quality that would be amazing of itself, but even more impressively it serves as an introduction to Chinese myth. Astonishingly, this is the author's first book.<br />The characters are beautifully drawn. Even minor characters like Doctor Death, a Chinese alchemist who makes a brief appearance, is fully developed. The main characters - Number Ten Ox and Master Li - are as memorable as any characters in fantasy. All are lively, ironic and self-consistent.<br />The plot is a delightful rollercoaster ride, a quest within a quest, that will keep you guessing until the marvelous conclusion. It's a nearly flawless assemblage of many Chinese myths, some developed in depth and some only mentioned in passing. And much of it is Hughart's own invention.<br />The narrative is quite good, and Hughart does an especially good job of explaining literally dozens of instances of Chinese culture that will be completely new to most Western readers.<br />Some reviewers say they were put off by the story's many anachronisms. But Hughart doesn't pretend to be writing Chinese history or Chinese literature. Most readers don't know and don't care that events are out of sequence, or that myths have been distorted; those that do need to read the brief author's note that opens the book. I direct them specifically to the definition of &quot;prolepsis&quot; that appears there.<br />This is an absolutely terrific read. You don't need to know a thing about or even like Chinese myth or Chinese culture to delight in this tale. This is a delightful story that is exceptionally well told. Like any great work of fantasy, when you finish reading it, and have bowed with Number Ten Ox to the four corners of the world, the real world you return to will seem just a little dimmer than the brilliant vision Barry Hughart has created.	2001-06-08

Her thesis: you can only become whole by facing and accepting death, the darkest shadow. Lifted straight from Jungian psychology, this is the hardest and the important part of being whole. Sparrowhawk knows most of this truth already: remember the climax to Wizard of Earthsea. Arren, the young prince who accompanies Sparrowhawk on the epic voyages of this third book, has not yet learned this harsh lesson.<br />You don't need to know anything about Carl Jung to read and enjoy this book. At one level, this is a children's tale. But this book has many levels. Consider: the last king, Maharrion, had prophesied that there would be no king to succeed him until one appeared who had crossed the farthest shore. I'm not giving anything away by telling you that the farthest shore is physical - the western shore of the westernmost isle of Earthsea and metaphysical - death. And readers of earlier books know that for the wizards of Earthasea, there is a low stone fence that separates the living from the dead.<br />There is another wizard - humiliated by a younger Sparrowhawk - who has both great power and a terror of death. And he has worked a spell that will devastate the world, by denying and avoiding death. But by denying death, he has denied life, and magic, song, joy, reason and even life are draining out of the world. That spell must be undone before it is too late. And that task falls to Sparowhawk and Arren.<br />Arren must learn to understand and accept that death is necessary. Not just in the abstract but personally. He must cross that low stonewall with no hope of returning. He must cross the final shore.<br />This story has dragons, despair, joy, loss, discovery and marvelous surprises. Like all of the Earthsea books, it is sparely but beautifully told. The deepest of the first three books, it is an absolute joy. And for a thoughtful, reflecting reader, it might be even more. This is a book that can change a reader's life.ange a reader's life.	2001-06-01

This is the story of Tenar, a young priestess at the Tombs of Atuan.<br />Earthsea has places where there are elder powers present. Readers of &quot;Wizard of Earthsea&quot; encountered one in the Terrenon. Tenar, as an infant, is given to the elder power of the Tombs. Her name is taken from her and she becomes Arha, &quot;the eaten one.&quot; She serves as a priestess to a nearly forgotten religion that treats the power of the Tombs as a god. But everything Tenar has been told is twice a lie; her religion is almost forgotten and the Power is anything but a god.<br />This is the story of how Tenar came to understand that her life, all of what she had been and most of what she believed was a lie. LeGuin makes it utterly convincing, in a spare, terse way that is stark and persuasive. Sparrowhawk plays a crucial role in all this, but he is not the protagonist. Sparrowhawk may have been the catalyst for Tenar's changes, but like a catalyst he is mostly unchanged by the process. It is Tenar who is changed. This is Tenar's tale.<br />Can you imagine how devastating it must have been for Tenar? How many of us could accept and understand that what we had been taught was evil or, worse still, utterly meaningless? Could you do as well if, say, Christianity were revealed to be an utter fraud? LeGuin makes it vivid. Any thoughtful reader is left in awe of Tenar's strength and resilience. And in awe of LeGuin's writing.<br />In most trilogies, the middle book is the weakest. Not the Earthsea books. This is a wonderful tale, superbly told. Very highly recommended.	2001-05-29

LeGuin took the fantasy and science fiction world by storm, bringing a genuinely literate voice and a deep knowledge of sociology and psychology to what was largely a man's genre. Her finest fantasy was &quot;The Earthsea Trilogy,&quot; comprised of &quot;A Wizard of Earthsea,&quot; &quot;The Tombs of Atuan&quot; and &quot;The Farthest Shore.&quot; They are marvelous stories, and they hint at other, older stories and myths. In many ways, the world of Earthsea is as deeply conceived as any in fantasy.<br />In &quot;Tehanu,&quot; a later book of Earthsea, she told us of some of the events that followed the events of &quot;The Farthest Shore,&quot; and delved deeper into the mystery of dragons and the relationship between dragons and men. From the simple creatures fought by Sparrowhawk in &quot;Wizard of Earthsea,&quot; they are revealed as increasingly complex and more interesting creatures by the end of &quot;Tehanu.&quot;<br />In &quot;Tales from Earthsea,&quot; LeGuin develops other themes and characters from the past and present of Earthsea. The tales are evocative, resonant and at once mythological and personal in tone. The reader will have an image of a LeGuin, with a larger volume in her lap, telling you the stories that catch her eye. You will sense there are many, many more stories to be told.<br />Readers new to Earthsea might do best by reading the books in order. While it's not required, you won't thoroughly understand the references to the Ring of Erreth-Akbe unless you have read the earlier books. The last short story, &quot;Dragonfly,&quot; may bewilder you unless you have read &quot;Tehanu.&quot;<br />At the end of the stories, there is a summary of the peoples, languages and history of Earthsea, modelled loosely on the famous Appendices to &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; I suppose the history consists of the stories that will never be told as novels or short stories, which is really too bad. The dry narrative of Erreth-Akbe, the greatest of Earthsea's heros, would have made a wonderful tale.<br />I was struck by LeGuin's subtle touches. The small cabin that was the summer home of Otter in the first tale, when the school of wizardry at Roke was founded, becomes the temporary home of Irian in the last story, which is set immediately following &quot;The Farthest Shore.&quot; Roke Knoll, which always reveals things to be what they truly are, plays a role in the first and last tales, too.<br />In her delightful foreword, LeGuin warns us, &quot;Authors and wizards are not always to be trusted: nobody can explain a dragon.&quot; Perhaps, but you can always trust LeGuin to entertain and enrich a thoughtful reader. And if anyone can satisfactorily explain a dragon, it will be LeGuin., the greatest of Earthsea's heros, would have made a wonderful tale.<br />I was struck by LeGuin's subtle touches.

In the world of Recluce, a few have the skills to master the power of Chaos, and a few have the power to master the skills of Order. It's evident from the more recent books involving Chaos masters that neither Chaos nor Order is intrinsically good or evil; it's the use those masters make of those forces.<br />We know from _The Order War_, _Fall of Angels_ and _The Chaos Balance_ that at deep and fundamental levels, Order and Chaos are balanced, and that an increase in either triggers an increase in the other. The entrenched Order of Recluce helped power Fairhaven in _The Order War_ . The Chaos on the continent of Candar in _The Magic of Recluce_ fed the white wizards.<br />And we know from _The Order War_ that Lerris' uncle, Justen, greatly reduced the forces of Chaos by annihilating Fairhaven and the core of white wizards who lived there sometime before Lerris was born. Under the Balance, the power of Order necessarily declined, too. The Mighty Ten became the less mighty three.<br />Yet in _The Death of Chaos_, we surely have in the mature Lerris surely the most powerful Order Master that Recluce has produced. More than any of the extraordinarily powerful Order Masters of the past, Lerris changes the world. His are, quite literally, Apocalyptic powers. So, under Modesitt's carefully crafted rules, where does this power come from? Where is the Chaos that permits Lerris to have such power? We know about Chaos focuses; what causes Lerris, in a time when there are a significant number of other Order Masters (his father, his uncle and his aunt, to name three), to have such world-changing powers? If there is such a thing as an &quot;Order focus,&quot; why does it exist in Lerris? His father and uncle, remember, destroyed Fairhaven.<br />It's a question Modesitt doesn't explain or even acknowledge. While _The Death of Chaos_ clearly calls for a sequel (What will Hamor do next? What has happened to the Angels? To Naclos? To the Balance?), it's hard to see how he can explain his way out of the problem he has created. Lerris simply should not be able to do what he does. For that matter, why are the Order-Chaos Balanced relatives of Lerris reduced to dust for heaven's sake? Did Lerris completely destroy the Balance? The epilogue suggests otherwise.<br />This is a good yarn, and it helped foreshadow Modssitt's break of the link between good and Order and between evil and Chaos that has followed in subsequent Recluce books. But for me the huge logical inconsistency that's the premise of the story makes it a less successful book.in his way out of the problem he has created.

The man write a good book - the first Sword Book and the Mask of Apollo in this series - and then he drives the idea past any point of entertainment in a sometimes unending series of sequels. How many Swords books are there now?<br />This time the author takes on Hercules, who narrates the story in the first person. Hercules wanders through 9 or 10 of the labors, disavows the others as myth and gets involved in an apocalyptic war between the gods and the giants. Saberhagen uses this war to explain away a lot of inconsistencies in Mask of Apollo and Ariadne's Web, the two earlier books. Zeus, for example, is revealed to be missing because he is afraid of a weapon of the giants.<br />Any doubts Hercules will survive are eliminated early, when he reveals he is telling the story from a later time. If we can't worry about Hercules, it just gets that much harder to get involved in his story. It's no longer a question of whether he will survive; rather, it's how he will muscle his way out of the next problem. Hercules' annoying shifts from clear thinker to muscle-headed moron distract as well.<br />Frankly, aside from the idea of faces, the gods of the early Swords books were a lot more interesting. And the gods of the much earlier Empire of the East more compelling still.<br />A lot of fantasy/science fiction writers have trolled mythology for ideas. And a lot of their stories are more interesting. Saberhagen's face idea is new; most of the rest is like reading Bullfinch.<br />I keep hoping Saberhagen will write a novel linking together the plainly related worlds of Empire of the East, Swords and this new Faces of the Gods series. That might be more interesting...	2001-05-06
US	52229435	RJKCC1H8S7TSJ	0060199563	461879486	Thief of Time	Books	5	87	89	N	N	Simply the Best Yet	I admit to enjoying Terry Pratchett very much. I've read all 26 Discworld books. I've got the juveniles and the early experiments like _Strata_. Perhaps the best part of reading so much of his work is that I can see how he has grown and evolved as a writer. _Thief of Time_ is an extremely sophisticated book and, while not his funniest, is plainly his best yet.<br />Early Discworld books were comedy monologues strung together by a plot. Sometimes a pretty thin plot. As just one example, a whole page was required to set up the famous &quot;felonious monk&quot; pun in _Soul Music_. The early stories tended to be pretty much a structure to support the jokes. Sure, there was more, but it was mostly for laughs.<br />Somewhere between _Hogfather_ and _Carpe Jugulum_, Pratchett brought his writing to a new level. It's controversial among some of his fans, but the newer books raise deeper issues and work at multiple levels. There are still lots of laughs - you can't read about a raven named &quot;Quoth&quot; without smiling - but there's also a terrific, compelling story to be told. While the humor in _Color of Magic_ could be sophomoric - remember when the imp ran out of the color pink when Rincewind and Twoflower visited the Whore Pits? - there is nothing even slightly sophomoric about the plot or jokes in _Thief of Time_.<br />This story involves the ongoing struggle between Death and the Auditors, the use and abuse of time, quantum physics, the Monks of Time (appearing for the first itme since _Small Gods_) and the peculiar and completely different aptitudes of two very different young men to manipulate time. As an unexpected bonus, you learn why there are those nagging inconsistencies across the Discworld novels; it turns out its not Terry's fault at all... Oh, and the whole Kung Fu/Mystic Masters thing gets the Pratchett Treatment.<br />On the Discworld, natural forces and even unnatural forces are personified. Death is a person. Well, maybe three persons, but I don't want to spoil anything. The Auditors - roughly, the heat death of the universe - are more or less persons. Time, as it turns out, is a person. And each of those Personifications has most of the foibles of humans. After all, humans invented them.<br />Trust me, it all makes perfect sense.<br />This is a terrific book. Highly recommended. You don't need to know anything about Terry Pratchett, the Discworld or Susan Sto Helit to appreciate this book. I disagree with other reviewers who say that we won't read Pratchett 25 years from now. We will, for the same reason we read Jonathan Swift, Mark Twain and other great satirists: their skewed view of their times that they present helps us understand our past. They help us understand what it means to be human.<br />The Discworld truly is a mirror of our world and, while it is mostly a fun house mirror, it's still possible to know without doubt what it is you are seeing in that distorting mirror.

Nonprofits range from multinationals to your local little league. While, technically, the same body of tax laws applies to all of them, the level of sophistication varies as dramatically as the size of the nonprofit. And while the big nonprofits can afford to buy expertise, smaller nonprofits have to manage more of the tasks themselves. This book can help.<br />Hopkins' book is an excellent reference for attorneys and accounts and nonprofit executives with some knowledge of nonprofit tax laws work. It's not likely to be useful to and it's not written for the average volunteer. This is a fairly technical resource, and while nonprofit tax law gets a lot more complicated than Hopkins, this is a very good middle-level resource.<br />If I have any criticism of Hopkins it's this: in recent editions he has removed important subjects from this reference and spun them off into separate books at equally high prices. Most of the treatment of charitable donations, for example, is now in a different book. Private foundations are now in a different book. Excess benefits transactions are in a different book. You can spend a ton of money on Professor Hopkins. It costs him one star in my rating.<br />Even so, as a basic entry point, this book is indispensable. I've attended seminars by Prof. Hopkins and read most his books, and he is very knowledgeable and does a good job at the difficult task of translating IRS-speak into comprehensible language. This book should be a part of every nonprofit lawyer and accountant's library.	2001-04-25

He died not long ago. And if I may quote Russell Chatham, &quot;It hurts to know that Harry Middleton rode the back of a garbage truck every night during the wee hours to put groceries on his family's table.&quot; It's true. It's part of this story.<br />This is the moving, affecting story of Middleton's struggle with depression, his mother's death of brain cancer, and, most memorably, a blind trout on the South Fork of the Platte River. Like all of Middleton's books, the language is wonderful and the characters are memorable. Perhaps more so than most, this book is Middleton laying his soul bare, telling a story as it happened, cutting close to the bone.<br />And if flyfishing isn't the whole story here, it is part of the path to redemption.<br />Harry, we hardly knew you, and I wish there had been more time, and more books. But you will live on for me and for those readers who discover you. Ollie ollie oxen free.	2001-04-24

His answer was, &quot;More than I want.&quot;<br />This is the story of a young boy growing up in a military family, stationed at a staging area during the Vietnam War. When one of his friends is killed - and Harry badly injured - playing with a grenade they found in the jungle, Harry is packed off to his grandfather, a subsistence farmer in the Ozarks of Arkansas. There, with his grandfather, granduncle and the old American Indian, Elias Wonder, Harry is healed, not just of the trauma of seeing his friend disappear in a &quot;pink mist&quot; but healed as well of a great deal of other things he may not have known ailed him.<br />As Harry learns the rhythms of the land and the mysteries of Starlight Creek from his grandfather and the irascible Elias Wonder, he grows and the reader grows with him. Like David James Duncan's _The River Why_, this is a book about growing up and coming of age, and flyfishing - that &quot;hopeless addiction to trout and the push of water against your legs&quot; - is simply the author's narrative tool.<br />Harry must have been a more patient and willing teenager than I was, or perhaps time has colored over Harry's experience, but there is nothing else to criticize. Beautifully written, exceptionally well told, full of life, sadness, humor, death and understanding.<br />And if flyfishing became an addiction for Harry, that was to haunt him in his later years, well, he was warned and in any event there are far worse fates.	2001-04-05

In this novel, he takes his manic punning, wordplay and double- and triple-entendre to the highest level.<br />Soul Music has three narrative threads: Death takes a holiday (which Pratchett fans will remember from _Mort_), Mort's orphan daughter, Susan Sto Helit, and her attempts to cope with the family legacy, and the discovery of rock and roll on the disc. The three stories intertwine and the result, for me, ranged from snickers to guffaws.<br />The big news is that rock and roll comes to the disk, through the agency of a pawnshop guitar and a skilled harpist, whose name translates as &quot;Bud of Holly&quot; and who looks kind of Elvis[h]. With a dwarvish horn player named Glod and a trollish drummer named Cliff, the band Music with Rocks In takes the Discworld by storm. The Librarian, the monk... orangutan who runs the Wizard's library, sits in on keyboards, and exceeds even the excesses of Jerry Lee Lewis. You cannot imagine a rock music issue that Pterry doesn't reach. Women fans pitch articles of clothing; espresso shops appear; rock promoters - C.M.O.T. Dibbler, of course - arrive; even the sedate wizards wear leather, do their best James Dean and show they, too, are &quot;Born to Rune.&quot;<br />Parts of the book are a pastiche of &quot;Blues Brothers&quot; (&quot;We're on a mission from Glod&quot;), &quot;Spinal Tap,&quot; and &quot;Woodstock.&quot; Other parts are simply Pratchett's own mad invention. And this book also features Pterry's best pun - &quot;some felonious monk;&quot; possibly the best pun in literature since Niven's and Gerrold's _The Flying Sorcerors_. You can spend a lot of time just working out the puns. And let me note that Led Zeppelin's &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; gets the treatment it righteously deserves.<br />But while Buddy and his band tour with their roadie Asphalt and inescapably head towards Dead Man's Curve, and while Death does his best to learn how to forget with the help of the Klatchian Foreign Legion and alcohol, Susan makes increasingly frantic efforts to keep what passes for reality on the Discworld from coming completely unstuck. With the help of the Death of Rats, Albert and other favorites, the Disc is saved, but not without some uncommon poignancy.<br />There are scholarly articles on whether Pratchett writes parody or satire. However labelled, this was the high water mark for his experiments with the pure form. Anglo-American literature has never had as brilliant a satirist/parodist as Terry Pratchett. He may have written better Discworld books, but I'm not sure he has written a funnier book.

It's a little like being in the washing machine on spin cycle. You emerge dizzy but refreshed. Machine gun pacing, vivid characterization, universe-spanning cultures and, of course, The Culture. Smug, self-satisfied, hedonistic and vain, The Culture is also bifurcated between more-or-less humankind and Minds, advanced AI's that are not always tolerant of their &quot;meat-based&quot; co-citizens.<br />More than any other novel of The Culture, this one involves those Minds and, without spoilers, they turn out to be human, all too human. Banks handles very well the problem of writing dialog for beings who are far, far more intelligent and think millions of times faster than we do. As others have noted, it sometimes makes for dense reading, but it is very believable. In some ways, this is a novel about the psychology and motives of Minds.<br />As always, Banks laces the story with sly humor, word play and wholly believable aliens. The Affront, the most conspicuous aliens in this tale, are a wonderful invention. As always, the structure of the novel itself with its interlacing of different story lines and physical organization is a part of the story itself, although less obviously so than in the earlier _Consider Phlebas_.<br />The Excession of the title is the focus of the attention of most of the characters in the story, but Banks is far too gifted a writer to make it the whole story. Readers who complain about the ending may be missing Banks' most important point. Perhaps the story isn't so much about the Excession, but how the characters react to the Excession. And maybe the ending is Banks' way of underscoring that point.<br />As always with Banks' stories of The Culture, there is moral ambiguity and it's impossible to tell the good guys from the bad guys. For my taste, that's a lot more &quot;real&quot; than the moral absolutes of space operas in the tradition of E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith.<br />An excellent, rollicking adventure, full of surprises, laughs and sly irony. Densely written but highly readable. Much more mature than earlier Culture novels. Highly recommended./>An excellent, rollicking adventure, full of surprises, laughs and sly irony.

I discovered &quot;The Magic of Recluce&quot; through Science Fiction Book Club, and was captivated. It's a brilliant book, with some genuinely new ideas on the shop-worn coming of age theme, and a truly new set of ideas for a the operating rules of a universe.<br />When he leaves Recluce, it seems to me, Modesitt fares less well. &quot;Raven&quot; is an interesting yarn, speculating on societal balance if we had genetic engineering and on-demand nanotech assistance. If those benefits were available only at a steep price, how would the society be affected? Would the wealthy establish a plutocracy?<br />This is hardly a new theme in science fiction. Zelazny's &quot;Lord of Light&quot; probably defined this plot line. Modesitt is not Zelazny. While the protagonist, himself one of the augmented elite, acts on behalf of the disadvantaged, he doesn't do so from any higher principle than self-protection: it's to stop the shadowy bad guys from killing him. And he doesn't act to make things better; he preserves the deeply flawed status quo to keep things from getting still worse.<br />At times the plotting and dialogue sinks to the potboiler yarn, reminiscent of the recent Julian May &quot;Perseus Spur&quot; series; likeable enough but annoying because you know the author can do much better.<br />In some ways, Modesitt seems to just be grinding out the books now, no longer bringing to them the soaring invention and new ideas that characterized the first few Recluce books. He's still worth reading, but keep your expectations firmly under control... And let's hope for a return to form.	2001-02-25

There was a sequel planned - I can find references to Ms. Kirstein's reading portions of it at science fiction conventions - but it doesn't seem to have ever been published. This book and its prequel, &quot;The Steerswoman,&quot; are among my treasured paperbacks.<br />At the risk of giving spoilers, imagine a world that's nearly uninhabitable by man, filled with plants and animals inimical to earthkind. Now imagine a program for the terraforming of that world, a program that will take centuries if not millenia, involving first infrared bombardment by satellite and the burning of the borderlands, then sowing a genetically engineered plant that serves as a transition to earth life, and then a succession of increasingly earth-like plants.<br />After hundreds or thousands of years, in the areas treated first, the land is pretty much indistinguishable from earth; at the borders, life is strange and harsh. Most of the planet is apparently unchanged. Different peoples and cultures inhabit the various zones as the millenia-long terraforming proceeds.<br />To make things stranger still, those with knowledge have made themselves sorcerers and wizards, wielding technology when and how it suits them, quarreling among themselves and extirpating those who would try to recover science and technology. Most residents in this world are technologically ignorant, unknowingly held in that state by the technocractic wizards.<br />The sorcerers grudgingly tolerate a band of Socratean scholars, the Steerswomen, who have re-developed principles of logic and serve as explorers, historians and cartographers. They mingle with the people of this world, operating by two rules: they will answer any question you ask, provided that you answer the questions they ask you. If you refuse to answer a Steerswoman's question, they shun you. It works pretty well...<br />But the wizards have their schemes, and as Rowan the Steerswoman struggles to understand them with the help of Bel, an outskirter, a member of one of the tribes on the fringe of the terraforming, the importance of understanding the schemes is increasingly urgent. Because one of the wizards is willing to use the infrared/burning tool in the satellite system to burn terraformed lands, and it is a terrifying weapon. The same wizard has caused one of the satellites to crash, at what jeopardy to the terraforming product we don't yet know.<br />It is fascinating to watch Rowan struggle to understand the issues and her situation, to see her begin to grasp that the world she knows is not the world on which earthkind evolved. With her, we are ignorant as to the wizards' motives, but we can understand better than her the risks their actions are creating.<br />Add to this meticulously crafted world and plot the vivid characters of Bel and Rowan, the logically consistent and believable cultures her world has spawned, and you have a wonderful story .... that is incomplete. It's half told. It's maddening.<br />I don't know if the problem is with Ms. Kirstein, her editor, her publisher or some combination of them, but this is a storyline that needs to be completed. Please. I'm begging...<br />Read and enjoy &quot;The Outskirter's Secret&quot; and &quot;The Steerswoman.&quot; But be prepared to wait a long time, at best, for the rest of the story.schemes, and as Rowan the Steerswoman struggles to understand them with the help of Bel, an outskirter, a member of one of the tribes on the fringe of the terraforming, the importance of understanding the schemes is increasingly urgent.

They have their flaws, and they are undeniably derivative to the role-playing game, &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons.&quot; But saying that Moon wrote a dungeons and dragons ripoff is unfair; filet mignon and hamburger are fundamentally the same product, but a completely different experience. Moon started from the classic characters of AD&amp;D - itself derivative to Tolkein and Lewis among others - and conceived a new universe around it, peopled by gods, demons, elves, dwarves, gnomes and humans. Her universe has a deep and rich history, with its shares of tragedy and loss, some half-glimpsed and some detailed. By contrast, what passes for history in AD&amp;D, for the most part, resides in the players' heads.<br />Others have criticized her world as illogical and inconsistent - where did all that steel come from, they ask? The point is valid, but looking for absolute logic in fantasy strikes me as unrealisistic and, in any event, that particular logical flaw can be traced back before Tolkein to T.H. White and Spencer. Moon's universe is much more self-consistent than most and the inconsistencies do not detract.<br />Still others criticize Paksenarrion, who at the end is a religious knight, and complain the morally ambiguous Arvid is more interesting. That's a problem endemic to literature. E.E. &quot;Doc&quot; Smith's epic villain, Skylark, is vastly more interesting than the good guys who fight him; shucks, &quot;Inferno&quot; is by far the most interesting book in Dante's &quot;Divine Comedy.&quot; We like moral ambiguity; perhaps those who are truly and completely good make us nervous and a little guilty. It's easier to identify with Arvid.<br />Moon's use of a heroine as the principle protagonist was pioneering. And her creation of a sometimes foolish and stubborn heroine at that, blind to some important issues, makes this book much better than most. Moon did not invent the naive or foolish protagonist; think of Ford Maddox Ford's &quot;The Good Soldier.&quot; But she did pioneer the use of the device in epic fantasy.<br />Overall, this is a compelling story, hardly Tolkein but far superior to 95% of the genre. This is a moving, well-told and well-cast tale. Strongly recommended.y with Arvid.<br />Moon's use of a heroine as the principle protagonist was pioneering.

It's easy and accurate to say that her parents' interests inform her brilliant writing, and that cultural anthrpology and Jungian psychology are at the core of Wizard of Earthsea and its three sequels.<br />But the book isn't a treatise. It's a wonderful, well-told story of a young man, Ged, coming of age in a world where words can have the power of magic and dragons are as real as earthquakes. There is nothing didactic about this story; Le Guin's writing is compelling and her characters are vivid: Ogion, the Mage of Silence, whose word had stilled an earthquake; Vetch, who helps Ged on a deadly quest for no reason but friendship; Murre, Vetch's sister; Yevaud, the dragon of Pendor; and Skiorh, possessed by a gebbeth.<br />Earthsea doesn't exist in a vacuum. Le Guin constructs a deep and textured history, and her characters act in ways that are consistent with that world. She manages the trick of writing a mythic tale without falling into the traps and foibles of sounding like you are trying.<br />The climax is straight from Carl Jung, but you don't need to know Carl Jung from Steve Young to appreciate it.<br />From time to time, religious groups call for this book to be banned from school libraries, claiming it promotes witchcraft. Nonsense. This is a book every teenager should read. It speaks to self-understanding, nothing more.<br />And some feminists criticize Le Guin because Ged is a male character. Again, nonsense, Ged is an archetype, and his gender matters not at all.<br />This is an important book. It's also terrific fun. Highly recommended.	2001-01-06

Once again, Banks takes us to The Culture, his galaxy-spanning civilization of humans, computer Minds, asteroid-sized Ships and annihilating weapons. Ah yes, weapons.<br />Banks intertwines two stories: one of The Culture and one of a world not yet contacted by The Culture. That pre-contact world is the home of a four children, a brother, two sisters and another boy, hidden from others, who is almost a brother. The oldest brother is the protagonist of both stories. Here we see him as a boy and young man, and see one aspect of the use weapons.  Because the brother and the almost-brother become enemies in a war that knows no restraints.<br />The other story involves The Culture's efforts to subtly and less-subtly control other, non-Culture civilizations, through its Contact division and the Special Circumstances unit of Contact. Special Circumstances does the dirty work for Contact. Like much of the nomenclature in The Culture, names are euphemisms or worse. You see, special cases may require Special Circumstances, where the usual rules of Contact don't apply.<br />Cheradenine Zakalwe is a mercenary for Special Circumstances. He is a weapon in its hands. He takes his assignments without knowing if he is fighting on the winning or losing side, whether he is working with good guys or bad guys, or whether The Culture wants him to succeed or fail. No more than a rifle knows or cares where it is aimed, he is a weapon in the hands of his employers.<br />Diziet Sma is his handler. Early in the book, she recalls a time when her drone, itself an intelligent, thinking machine, used its weapons in full when Sma was attacked. Banks' description of her reaction to an unrestrained use of weapons is more than ironic.<br />Cheradenine Zakalwe is also the brother in that family on that unnamed world. The story of his youth and the story of his work for The Culture intertwine like the alternating chapters in the novel, spinning around each other faster and faster until Cheradenine Zakalwe and the reader confront an explosive, ugly, evil truth that has been there the entire time. Banks' revelation is so perfect that you will only ask yourself how you didn't see it sooner.<br />Anything, Banks is telling us, anything at all can be a weapon, and the failure of restraint in the use of weapons dooms us all.<br />This is an exceptional book, not the easiest of Banks' Culture books to read but by far the most rewarding. And I promise you, after reading this book you will never look at a small chair, especially a small chair painted white, in quite the same way.alwe and the reader confront an explosive, ugly, evil truth that has been there the entire time.

This is his most brilliant book, a terrific blend of mythos and technology.<br />The former crew on this colony world rules the former passengers as gods rule peasants. Through technology, they have achieved many aspects of godhood, including reincarnation, terrifying weapons and psi powers by which they can kill with a look. The religion chosen for this more-than-theocracy is Hinduism.<br />Former crew Sam, while he likes his worldly pleasures, revolts against his peers, and casts himself as Buddha against the theocracy (as well as filling prayer machines with slugs, allying himself with the indigenous creatures and engaging in enough apocalyptic battles to satisfy the most jaded Robert Jordan fan). As Siddhartha and the Mahasamatman he sows the seeds that threaten to bring down the theocracy. And he demonstrates that even the most insincere Buddha can have true converts, true believers, and that the power of religion transcends its uses.<br />With a wonderful storyline, replete with flashbacks and plot twists, Zelazny crafts an absolutely terrific story. The book has no weak points.<br />This was the first book to base a world on a technologically rationalized mythos. Zelazny attempted it later in &quot;Creatures of Light and Darkness,&quot; using the Egyptian mythos, but the book is much less successful. &quot;Lord of Light&quot; is the struggle of Buddhism against militant Hinduism, where technology, not spiritualism, rules. But it's the plot, the characterization and Zelazny's wonderful ironic tone that make this an exceptional book.<br />It's great to see this book back in print. Highly recommended.	2000-12-14

While the volume stands on its own, I think you'd be hard pressed to get caught up. If you can, read the first volume, Suldrun's Garden, before starting The Green Pearl.<br />The book continues the chronicles of the Elder Isles, the lost islands of fantasy between France and Britain. As is the first book, Vance skillfully weaves together seemingly unrelated stories into a coherent whole. Mostly, the book centers around the adventures of Ailias, now a king, and his efforts to solve the personal and royal problems that beset him.<br />As was the case in Suldrun's Garden, there are long stretches that are almost dreamlike in their tone. A long interlude between Ailias and a barbaric Ska princess is remarkable for its combination of lucidity and dreamlike character; when that particular adventure ends, you very much feel you, with Ailias, have wakened from a dream.<br />The book does suffer the problem of any second book in a trilogy: it's primarily a bridge between the discoveries in the first book and the denouements in the last. But there are enough new characters and new ideas to keep you fascinated. There are comically sinister magicians, recalcitrant nobles, dying kings and a different view of the barabaric Ska. The book is much less obviously derivative than Suldrun's Garden.<br />Altogether a most satisfying read. Strongly recommended.	2000-12-01
US	52229435	R3KPOIECFGVL02	0887330827	731056546	Madouc	Books	5	34	35	N	N	A Charming Changeling	Madouc, the third book in Vance's Lyonesse Trilogy, is probably the best. The first two books, Suldrun's Garden and The Green Pearl, are wonderful, but the title character, Madouc, and her search for her pedigree, are among the most charming characters and quests in fantasy. She steals the show.<br />Casimir, the relentlessly scheming king of Lyonesse, has learned the child he thought was his grandaughter, Madouc, is in fact a fairy changeling. That is somehow wrapped up in the mystery of Dhrun, son of King Ailias of Troicenet, of whom it was prophecied by a magic mirror that he would be the king of all the Elder Isles. Not if Casimir can help it. He wants that throne for himself.<br />And there are much larger, darker schemes afoot, as the evil magician Tamurello and the mysterious witch Desmei plot against Murgen, the Elder Isle's greatest wizard, who alone keeps the Elder Isles from sinking into the sea.<br />And into this web of political and magical intrigue wanders Madouc, determined to learn her pedigree, possessed of a bit of her fairy mother's magic and a truly wonderful charm all her own. It is Madouc who sets this novel apart from other fantasies. Vance does a splendid job creating a central figure who will beguile and amaze you.<br />Vance blends myths from half a dozen cultures into a seamless whole. The Elder Isles are saved, if at a terrible cost. The kingship is resolved, after a terrible war. And Madouc even learns her pedigree. The book is full of surprises, and sly references to other legends. As just one example, you will learn how the Holy Grail got to where Sir Gallahad could find it...<br />You should read the whole Trilogy. If for some reason you cannot, read Madouc. It's a wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.	2000-12-01

The richly imagined land of Lyonesse and the Elder Isles, the lost islands of fantasy between France and Britain, is alive with magic, vivid characters, devious schemes and Old Folk. In a wonderful synthesis of Tolkein and Old English myth, kings and children, magicians and knights, faeries and ogres wander in and out of each other stories.<br />Suldrun's Garden opens the trilogy. The other volumes are The Green Pearl and Maduoc. Suldrun, the daughter of the relentlessly scheming King Casimir of Lyonesse, wants nothing to do with the future her father has planned for her. For her stubbornness, she is exiled to a garden at the edge of Casimir's castle. One day, a shipwrecked sailor washes up on shore. He is Ailias, prince of the kingdom of Troicent, pushed overboard by his cousin. Lyonesse is at war with Troicenet, and the doomed relationship is one of the threads that make up this wonderful tale.<br />From changelings to evil tyrants, from hedge witches to Mulgren, who has dedicated his life to keeping the Elder Isles above the waves, Vance does a fine job of interweaving new stories and old. There are children's adventures that trace to the Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson; there are sly references to the King Arthur (his grandfather appears briefly); and there is much that is the marvelous creation of Vance himself.<br />This is my test for excellent fantasy: when you read it, the world created is brighter and more vivid than the world you return to at the end of the book. This book passes that test. I'd love to wander the forest of Tantrelles, or talk with Shimrod, or wander the Teac a Teac.<br />Highly recommended.	2000-12-01

It's been re-published recently by Orbit (ISBN 1-85723-138-4) and it's worth tracking down.<br />Like David Brin, Dan Simmons or Poul Anderson, this is high concept space opera. But unlike them, this book, and the subsequent books about The Culture, are morally ambiguous. Horza, the protagonist, despises the machine intelligences and moral laziness of The Culture. But his embrace of and alliance with The Culture's enemies in this galaxy-wide war reveals them to be intolerant, racist, religious zealots. He is much more comfortable with the agent of The Culture who infiltrates his band of pirates than with his erstwhile allies. Through plot twists, when he fights his allies with the help of his enemy, Banks makes many points on many levels.<br />The book is amazingly compelling. As Horza careens from debacle to disaster, fighting a battle in which he only partially believes, you come to care a about him. Which is surprising, because by any sane standard he an amoral criminal.<br />Banks is a good but not exceptional writer. But he produces very remarkable books. Even the coda to this book, in which Bank reports the war, of which this story is a tiny, tiny part, caused 850 billion casualties; even the coda underscores the ambiguity of the tale.<br />What makes a culture &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;? In the course of telling a very good story, Banks makes you wonder if you are asking the right question.	2000-11-19

Luckily, Heaven and Hell have left the business with the Anti-Christ in the hands of Crowley and Aziraphale, demon and angel respectively. Now they have misplaced the Anti-Christ and pretty much decided they really like humanity a lot more than their either of their bosses.<br />In the first edition, the full title of this book was &quot;The Nice &amp; Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch.&quot; &quot;Nice,&quot; in this context, meaning precisely correct. Agnes saw it all coming, from her being burned alive as a witch to the air force base where Armageddon will begin (&quot;Peas is our professiune.&quot;). Agnes, her descendant, Anathema, the Four Horseman - Horsepersons - and the Other Four Horseman (a different chapter of Hell's Angels); it all comes together with the serried ranks of angels and demons gathered overhead.<br />Yes, this is an hysterically funny book. A satire and a parody, it lampoons everything in sight. From Elvis sightings to televangelists to the destruction of all intelligent life (&quot;nothing left but dust and fundamentalists.&quot;), little escapes the scathing wit of Gaiman and Pratchett.<br />Of course the demon, Crowley, drives a 1926 Bentley. Of course any tape left in its glove box for more than two weeks turns into something by Queen. Of course the flaming sword used by War is delivered to her by International Express.<br />And what happens to the telephone solicitor, Lisa Morrow? Come on now, you secretly thought all telephone solicitors deserved it, right?<br />In the tradition of Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain, the satire makes a point. That point may be unpalatable to the religiously inflexible, or to those whose sense of righteousness hampers their sense of humor. Critics of Swift and Twain would find much to criticize in Good Omens. But Pratchett and Gaiman demonstrate that we don't need Heaven or Hell to have Good and Evil in the world; we have all we need in ourselves. It's the humanity of Adam Young, the Adversary, the Angel of the Bottomless Pit, etc., it's his human-ness that ultimately makes all the difference.<br />Don't read this book in bed; you'll keep your spouse awake, laughing out loud. But there's nothing else bad that can be said about it. Ineffability may be beyond our understanding, but humor, even humor in the face of the End of the World, we can understand.<br />Try this book.

Duncan uses fishing as one kind of  bait, along with wonderful humor, beautiful writing and memorable  characterization, to make a much larger, much more important set of  points.<br />Second, the plot isn't about fishing, or living in harmony with  nature; it's about a young man's discovering what life really is. The  Perfect Schedule - young Gus's plan for getting in the absolute maximum  number of hours a day fishing - turns out to be a horrible failure. It  takes a long time for Gus to realize something is wrong, including a  harrowing adventure with a drowned man and some pretty serous sickness. Now  it may be - ahem - that fisherpersons are more stubborn or more stupid, but  Duncan has Gus discover that there are things more important than fishing,  and that those things can lead to still greater things. And that all of  that can make the fishing better.<br />Third, while Duncan and Gus poke  immense amounts of fun at it, this really is a re-casting of Izaak Walton's  _The Compleat Fisherman_, although Walton is nearly unreadable and Duncan  writes extraordinarily well. This book is also about more or less the same  thing as those &quot;witlesses&quot; that Ma brings to grief, although both  Gus and the Witlesses would likely deny it. One of Duncan's subtle messages  is there, too.<br />Fourth and last, like a fish taking a fly, when you read  this book you will be so dazzled by the gorgeous fly of Duncan's humor,  writing and characterization that you will miss the hook and line of his  real message until, like Gus, the line of light has you and you feel that  gentle tug in your heart.<br />Beautiful and subtle, hilarious and passionate,  charming and amazing, this book is simply an astonishing piece of writing.  It's one of my ten or so favorite books, and likely will be one of yours,  too.	2000-09-08

It's not even natural history, since most of the behavior he views  is the result of his own, contrived experiments.

It doesn't work.<br />I live in interior  Alaska and ravens are a part of the environment. They are clever, adaptable  and resilient animals. Those that have habituated to cities prefer  dumpsters behind fast food restaurants over any other kind, MacDonalds best  of all. The incredible range of sounds they can make approaches the  uncanny. And to see one on a streetlight at -50, a dim shape in the ice  fog, is to understand a part of what makes both ravens and Alaska special.<br />But as much as I love ravens, this book does little to help me or anyone  else understand them.

But, as much as I love  the old songs, I cringe when I see the old rock bands, still touring,  singing exactly the songs, note for note, word for word, and gesture for  gesture. And as much as I like the saga of Recluce, and the depth of the  world that Modessit has created, there's a sense of seeing the same old  band, singing the same old song. Through 12 novels now.<br />The book is  interesting, the characters are interesting - Ryalth, the consort of Lorn,  the protagonist, is a compelling female - but the plot is _Colors of Chaos_  all over again, set about 200 years after the arrival of colonists from the  Rational Stars, the bad guys in _The Chaos Balance_. Folks who have read  _The White Order_ and _The Colors of Chaos_ will be able to predict exactly  what happens.<br />Recluce is well-conceived world. Modessit has important  things to say about good and evil, power and responsibility, and duty. But  he needs to develop some new plots.<br />When you consider that all of the  stories so far have only involved one continent and one large island (with  a brief interlude in Hamor in one book), well, either Modessit will find a  new plot line or his audience will get thinner. One new plot might explain  why, seemingly, the casualties of both sides in an interstellar war in a  different (?) universe keep getting stranded on the same backwater  world.<br />Read this book for the additional insights on the history of  Candar and Recluce, but don't expect much else new.	2000-09-05

In the opinion of the Pulitzer Committee, this is his greatest work. Except, perhaps, for Coming Into the Country, it's hard to  argue with that conclusion.<br />McPhee set out to describe the geology across  the United States, roughly along the route of Interstate 40. The decision  came at about the same time as a revolution in geology, the emergence and  dominance of the theory of &quot;plate tectonics&quot; and  &quot;continental drift. The four books that comprise Annals, written  across an interval of 15 years, reflect the increasing maturity of those  theories and the deepening understanding of the implications of that  scientific revolution.<br />McPhee's ability to explain complex geology  concepts in everyday terms, and to humanize and de-mystify abstract  science, has never been better. His ability to explain his topics through  people, and to make those people come alive, has never been more skilled.  In explaining the geology of California, for example, he notes that most of  California, like most Californians, originally came from somewhere else.  McPhee has not written primarily as science popularizer. But his writing  here is so good, his explanations so clear and his understanding of the  topic so profound that he shames most authors who work in the genre full  time.<br />This is not &quot;Rocks for Jocks,&quot; as introduction to  geology classes are often described. This is hard science, controversial  theories and mind-boggling intervals of time laid out in terms that  non-scientists can understand. From the creation of the Delaware Water Gap  to the family history of geologist David Love to the details of the  California gold rush, McPhee lays out geology and the consequences of  geology in accessible ways.<br />It's a brilliant book. After reading it,  you'll never look at a roadcut or the terrain around you in quite the same  way again.	2000-07-21

The three stories in this volume are among the best of the early books, and show Brust's writing at its best.  But any thoughtful reader needs to consider the subject.<br />Here we have a  hero in Vladimir Taltos who makes his living assassinating people, selling  illicit - well, untaxed - drugs, running whorehouses and operating a  numbers racket. He's not a nice guy. It's true that he had a rough  childhood, lives as a member of minority in a culture that's even less  nice, and tried work as a restaurateur first, but even so...<br />How can we  like this guy? How can we recommend books about this guy to anybody?<br />The  Dragarean culture is deeply dysfunctional. It is based on sorcery in  fundamental ways, and upon the failure of sorcery a few hundred years  before Taltos was born, the society essentially collapsed into chaos  (sorry). Crime, including assassination, is an accepted line of work. The  empress herself recognizes its necessity.<br />Nor are all assassinations  necessarily fatal, although a lamentable number of those that Taltos  commits seem to be. Sorcery is very powerful, and revivification is often  possible.<br />And so many of the targets richly deserve it.<br />And there is  an afterlife. At least for Dragearans.<br />And sometimes Taltos feels bad  about it afterwards. After the torture and murder of one sorceress, who was  guilty of nothing more than what Taltos does for a living, he tells us that  years later it still bothers him.<br />Brust is a good enough writer that he  makes you like Vlad Taltos, and care about him, despite his vocation. Brust  presents the picture of a deeply complex man who wants to deny those  complexities, in the tradition of the best mystery writers. Characters are  well-developed, plot lines imaginative and tight, and the dialog is very  good.<br />The novels are themselves are each very much pieces of the puzzle  that is Vlad Taltos. While there are a few inconsistencies across the  books, they are relatively minor. There is a sense that Vlad Taltos is much  more important than he knows, and that he will have a critical, even  indispensable, role in the society in which he finds himself. There are  mysteries that span several books, some still unanswered. Who is Vlad's  mother, for example? Why does the very oldest Dragearan foster and protect  him? Why does a goddess take such a interest in him? The mysteries and  shadows, some revealed in later books and some still dark, make Taltos more  compelling.<br />These are entertaining, even compelling yarns in a richly  imagined world. In the end, you don't care that Vlad Taltos is a  multiple-murderer; you just want Steven Brust to write another book.s of the puzzle  that is Vlad Taltos.

To his  credit, he brings both off very well.<br />Diamonds' thesis, as noted by other  reviewers, is that the triumph of western culture traces in large measure  to accidents of geography and environment. In particular, the east-west  orientation of Eurasia and the abundance of usable crop species and animal  species in Eurasia in general and the Fertile Crescent in particular. The  ability to create domestic crops and domestic animals, by his reasoning,  led through a series of steps to the development of larger communities, the  development of technology, and the triumph of the West.<br />Diamond's critics  accuse him of political correctness, of over-simplification and  determinism. I don't believe any of those criticisms is accurate.<br />Diamond frankly admits he is challenging the myth of caucasian inherent  superiority. The sense of outrage some reviewers express when Diamond  states that the most intelligent man he knows is a New Guinean  &quot;primitive&quot; more or less proves Diamond's point. By confusing  intelligence with education, and a subsistence culture with technological  culture, those critics demonstrate and illustrate the myth Diamond  addresses.<br />Half of his critics accuse Diamond of oversimplification; the  other half complain that he repeats points and that the book is hard to  read. I think this is mostly reaction to the common problem of a scholarly  subject being treated in a popularization. It is a very difficult thing for  a scientist to write a popularization of his or her subject that isn't  either condescendingly simplistic or too complex for lay readers. Diamond  strikes a nice balance.<br />Finally, critics claim that Diamond is asserting  a kind of determinism that denies free will and understates cultural  variables. They point to cultural variables like religion (the  aggressiveness of Christianity and Moslem beliefs, for example), social,  intellectual and others that are overwhelmingly important today. Those  critics are missing Diamond's key point: it was those geographical and  environmental factors he identifies that made the development of those  cultural variables possible.<br />Overall, this book is a very significant  contribution to lay understanding of why the West &quot;has more  cargo&quot; than other cultures. It is not intended to be a work of pure  scholarship; it doesn't pretend that this is the Complete and Final Answer.  It is frank in identifying issues still be be addressed. I strongly  recommend it to any reader who wants to better understand the world we have  inherited.of determinism that denies free will and understates cultural  variables.

There are now about 24 books in the DiscWorld series, possibly 25 if you live in Britain. But these are the two books that began the series. This is where it started.<br />I don't usually like parody. Harvard Lampoon's  &quot;Bored of the Rings,&quot; for example, has never impressed me. But  Pratchett has brought parody, and parody of the fantasy genre in  particular, to a new level in the DiscWorld series.<br />Pratchett's writing  in these early books, as you would expect, isn't nearly as good as it gets  later, but his characters are just as wonderful and his sense of the absurd  is working overtime. There are outright parodies (Cohen the Barbarian, a  lifetime in his own legend), homages (Firtz Leiber's Ffahrd and the Grey  Mouser) and horrible puns (&quot;luters, I expect&quot;). No fantasy novel  emerges unscathed.<br />Like most parodists, the plotting here is weak, with  Rincewind, the most incompetent wizard in literature, and Twoflowers, the  quintessential tourist, careening from disaster to disaster. In later  books, Pratchett's plotting is impeccable, but here it's just not that  good. But you don't read these two books for the plot, you read them for  the laughs, for the fun of recognizing characters and books, and for the  sheer hysterical madness.<br />The books are a delight. I caution you against  reading them in bed - your laughter will disturb your partner - but  otherwise whole-heartedly recommend them.	2000-06-02

You know it is inevitable from the time you first meet him - doing one-handed handstand pushups - that Sir Samuel is on a collision course with one Bad  Dog.<br />It's also true that while you can take Duke Vimes out of Ankh  Morpork, you can't take the cop out of Sam Vimes, even by making him the  ambassador to Uberwald. It's a little hard to relate the Sam Vimes of  &quot;Guards, Guards!&quot; to the man here. Sam Vimes seems infected with  Clint Eastwood, but the cynicism is still there.<br />More than any recent  Terry Pratchett story, this one is a novel, with the comic bits fewer and  the plot intensity ratcheted up to a new level. The Game isn't even  slightly funny, and dwarves are much more complicated than the  axe-swinging, quaffing half wits (sorry) we've seen in other books. There  are amusing moments, but for the first time I think Terry has a plot  carrying the story instead of gags strung together by a plot. If you  compare it with the thin shards of a plot in &quot;Color of Magic&quot; and  &quot;Light Fantastic,&quot; you can see how far he has come.<br />I think  some of the negative reviews - except for the accurate comments on the  lamentably incompetent proofreading - are a result of his shift in focus.<br />This is a very good book. Not the funniest. Not the cleverest. But it's  the closest thing there is likely to be to a &quot;mainstream&quot;  Discworld () novel. I enjoyed it very much.<br />And when Sam Vimes heads to  the plaza to confront Angua's brother, armed only with the leavings from  the raided clacks tower, puffing on his cigar; well, you can practically  see the dirty serape swirling in the wind.<br />Fetch.	2000-04-26

Those who have are the ones who have chosen to illustrate small parts of the larger whole, and selected the right parts. Margaret Murie  comes to mind. But 16 years on, Coming Into the Country is still the best.<br />I own and have read everything McPhee has written. I subscribe to New  Yorker mostly for the annual or biennial piece by McPhee. I like the  geology series very much, and parts of Birch Bark Canoe still make me laugh  out loud, but Country is his best book.<br />McPhee's many gifts including  finding and understanding interesting, compelling people, and writing about  them eloquently and non-judgmentally. He uses those people and what they  say to convey his larger themes. Stan Gelvin and his dad, Willie Hensley  and, of course, the folks in and around Eagle. He somehow wrangled a seat  on the state capital relocation committee's helicopter. He somehow charmed  the irascible Joe Vogler into candor. I talked with Vogler - who has since  been murdered in a gun deal gone bad - about McPhee's interview, and he  told me that McPhee took no notes during interviews over a week, and yet  &quot;pretty much got it right.&quot;<br />I've lived in Alaska most of my  life. I've read the gushy stuff (Michener, for example), the political  diatribes (Joe McGinnis, for example), and the gee-whiz tourist fodder.  McPhee, instead of trying to paint the whole state, paints a series of  miniatures which give you a much accurate glimpse than the writers and  hacks who try to &quot;describe&quot; Alaska.<br />Maybe it's that America's  best non-fiction writer brought his special tools and skills to the right  opportunities; maybe it's just luck. It all came together in this book. The  last bit, his walk down to the river and the growing worry, verging on  panic, that this is wilderness, that a bear could be around the next  corner, that he is not in control and can never be in control; the  eloquence and the message are what makes Alaska. No one has described it  better.<br />If you want to try to understand Alaska, its people, its  politics and why I live here, this book is the best place to start.

If you are not stunned - rocked back on your emotional heels and left gasping - by the fate or F. Paul Dure, then I think you must not be human. If you don't understand the literary scholarship behind the form of Hyperion, the reason John Keats and his poetry is a focus of the story and  the reason the demon is called The Shrike; well, you're missing half the  fun and you really should read something besides science fiction.<br />The  book works at many levels, not the least of which is a spectacular  impalment - a literal impalement, by the way - of religion in general and  Catholicism and Christianity in particular. God exists in this book in the  form of the Technocore, but there's nothing to admire. His angel is an  unstoppable killing machine, and his purposes are vile. But what is a  metaphor here is a large club in the Endymion series.<br />I like and re-read  Hyperion. It has moments that are transcendent. Simmons cannot sustain  those moments, though, which in my mind causes to book to fall short of  greatness.	2000-03-11

The premise is simple: the universe is not only full of life, it is old beyond belief, and  as caste-ridden as India. Since the fabled Progenitors, one race after  another has &quot;uplifted&quot; other races, by direct genetic  manipulation or selective breeding. Each race has it patron, each has its  clients who must discharge an multi-millenium period of servitude as  repayment for their uplift, and each aspires to its own clan.<br />Except the  earthling clan, which stumbles into this universe just before the beginning  of Sundiver. And not only do the earthlings not have a patron, they have  cheekily uplifted neo-dolphins and neo-chimps, creating their own client  races. They are wolflings. It's an moral affront and a religious insult to  other races that can trace their lines back a billion years.<br />So when one  of the earthling ships, captained by a neo-dolphin and crewed by the three  earthling peoples, stumbles across evidence of the fabled progenitors, the  race that started uplift, well, it's just too much for the older races.  Interstellar chaos ensues. Religious, economic and social wars break out,  almost all of it aimed at the wolfling earth clan.<br />The earthling ship is  chased across the five universes. The first book, Startide Rising is the  story of the ship's attempt to hide itself on an oceanic world. A gripping  plot, vivid characters, aliens that are really alien, and neo-dolphins that  are everything you could want them to be. It's a wonderful story, with a  stand up and cheer ending.<br />The second book, The Uplift War is the story  of just one minor consequence of the earthlings discovery. Essentially the  story of a counter-revolution, it's the triumph of low technology against  high technology on an ecologically damaged world, of a band of Tymbrimi  aliens, neo-chimps and humans against aliens who are really and truly  alien. Told from the shifting perspectives of Tymbrimi, bad guy Jiburu,  human and chimp, the story is clever, devious and captivating.<br />Brin's  physicist training shines through his writing. But in Brin's hands the  science is a means rather than an end. There's not the razzle-dazzle of the  old pulps, or the machine gun pacing of, say, Ian Banks, but instead highly  satisfying yarns with subtle themes, good plotting and strong  characterizations. Of course the dolphins speak in haikus; how else would  they talk?<br />This two in one volume has the Uplift Universe stories to  start with.

Uniquely in its history, the magazine devoted its entire issue to Hersey's 30,000 word essay. Only later was it turned into a  book; the final chapter on the subsequent lives of the six subjects wasn't  written until 1985.<br />Hersey set out to put a human face on the consquences  of the atomic bomb. All earlier news accounts, articles and stories had  been focused on the statistics, the science, and the effort that led to the  nuclear weapon. Understood in that context, understanding what Hersey was  trying to do and say, the book is even more remarkable.<br />It is not a  novel; a novel is a work of fiction. It is an essay, a work of reportage.  This story is true. The book is all the more remarkable because Hersey was  born and raised in China, the son of missionaries, and had no reason to be  sympathetic to or about the Japanese. A war correspondent for Time, he  earned a commendation from the U.S. Army at Guadacanal. He cannot fairly be  accused of anything but supreme objectivity. By telling the true stories of  six survivors in an absolutely straightforward way, without judging the  decision to use the bomb, he put an intensely human face on the  consequences.<br />He was criticized at the time and is criticized today for  taking the events that day out of context. The bomb is supposed to have  saved a million American casualties (a highly suspect figure today). It was  supposed to have shortened the war by a year or more. Those critics are  themselves missing the true context. At the time, the historical events  leading to Truman's decision were well known (although recast in February  1947 by Stinson). Hersey's goal was to make the story real in a new way.  Those facts are well and good, Hersey is saying, but there were bad  consequences as well. In the process, he created a remarkable book.<br />I was  glad to see New York University recently named Hersey's Hiroshima as the  best single work of reporting in the 20th century. As events unfold in the  escalating nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent, everyone needs to  understand the human consequences of the use of nuclear weapons.
