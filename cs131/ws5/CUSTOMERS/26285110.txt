Having bought this book for research purposes alone, never would I have expected such an enjoyable reading experience. Not only was every line packed with more information than I could wrap my pencil around, but the material was intriguing, the anecdotes well-researched and very accessible, and the references relatable for even the least learned student of the Georgian and Victorian eras (both of which are covered in the book). The author succeeded well at a difficult task by educating his readers, and making a seemingly bland topic enticing - I had no idea hymns could be so political, controversial and liberating. Last week they were staid, measured and over-used songs I was forced to sing as a child in church; today, they are tales of conflict, humility, celebration and seeking, and even more, a complex, inspiring art-form of which I was not fully aware. Author Ian Bradley's own enthusiasm and intrigue for the topic are wonderfully contagious. <br />	2004-07-21

Her anecdotal style makes the information fun and fascinating, and her insights invaluable, though one must have a sense of humor about both cultures as she is very tongue-in-cheek. As opposed to most other books I've read on the subject that are almost strictly technical, Walmsley tells the readers in a very conversational style about many differences that wouldn't occur to most travelers - differences in attitude (about sex, gender issues, finance, etc.), values, customs, etiquette and habits; and she may sometimes touch a little on why the discrepencies exist.  <br />  <br /> Because this is in no way a dictionary style book, she does not offer alternate words, phrases or technical info. Thus, as a supplement, I highly recommend &quot;Divided by a Common Language&quot; by Christopher Davies, who (as opposed to Walmsley) is a Brit who now lives in Florida. <br />  <br /> All in all - a humorous, anecdotal insight into two very different cultures. Even though this may not be as technical as some travelers would prefer, the information is crucial for developing a truer understanding than is offered in any travel guide, so do not pass it over for the latter; buy it as well. <br />  <br />	2004-07-21

It's sometimes difficult to know until you hold a journal in your hands if its quality is worthy of your thoughts. Curious about this series of blank books, I located one in a Border's store so I could examine it closely, and was sold (though I actually bought several of various styles through Amazon due to the greatly reduced price and wide selection).  <br /> <br />Just wanted to reassure any curious journal-keepers that this is a very nice book for having paper binding. The surfaces of the front and back plates are silky smooth, taut and very pretty. The spine, being sewn with strings, is tight, yet allows the book to lay completely flat when open. The pages inside are very smooth, practically non-porous grain, and of a medium weight, thick enough for fine-tip pen-and-ink, but too thin for any other medium of drawing or writing element. I'm usually a fan of leather-bound journals because they're sturdier and more aesthetically pleasing to me, but as paper-bound journals go, these are among the nicest I've seen. <br /> <br />	2004-07-21

US	26285110	R1MFELI4N7U211	0966094573	312185157	Divided By A Common Language: A British/American Dictionary	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Good Yen, but Yang Required for Balance...	Excellent book, much of it in the style of a dictionary. Offers specific phrases to use as alternatives in both American and British cultures. Written by a Brit who now lives in Florida, so it's nice to see the still-British-influenced language he uses in his narrations. And it's written for use in both cultures, not just geared to travelers from Britain traveling in America or vice-versa. <br />  <br /> I do think this book is perfect in combination with the book &quot;Brit-think Ameri-think&quot; by Jane Walmsley who is (as opposed to Davies) American born but now living in Britain. In her book, she offers the necessary complement to &quot;Divided&quot; by giving her readers a less technical, more anecdotal insight into the attitudes, habits and background of the two cultures (and she's humorous as well). <br />  <br /> On its own, this book is very technically good. <br />	2004-07-21
