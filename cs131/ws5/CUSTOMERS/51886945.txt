US	51886945	R1NJ9P2QNC0WKG	0553258478	734532649	Exodus	Books	4	5	8	N	N	A stirring story	It's been years since I first read this book, and I have read it several times since. Oddly, I don't think it's even particularly well-written. I think the plot is a bit disjointed, the writing uneven. However it tells such a stirring story that I love it anyway. I've always been half in love with Ari Ben Canaan.<br /><br />There is a bittersweet feeling about this book too, these days, 50 years after the events in the novel - when one looks at the current situation in the middle east. However I think this is a rousing read about the founding of Israel. I think it's a good book. With a couple more re-writes and tighter editing it could have been a great book.	2004-07-20

I only recently read Pride and Prejudice, and loved it so well that near the end I could hardly dare to put it down. And once finished, I hated to see it end and wanted to know what happened further with the characters.<br /><br />Thus it was such a pleasure to read Ms. Birchall's book and get to continue the saga. The read was most enjoyable, and the best compliment I can pay this book is to say that while I was reading it I completely forgot that I was not reading Jane Austen herself.	2004-07-20

I love mysteries, and I have always been fascinated by India, so this was a great combination. I didn't feel that the main character, Joe Sandilands, was as well-developed as I would like, and at the end of the book I still felt I didn't know him well, and didn't know what motivated him. I also felt his relationship with Nancy was a bit shallowly developed and not quite convincing.<br />However I thought the mystery part was very well-developed and interesting, and while the identity of the killer became obvious about 3/4 of the way through the book I was stumped as to motive, and the motive as revealed at the end was a complete surprise to me. I do wish I knew what a previous reviewer considered to be a physical impossibility in the solution. If so I sure didn't spot it. :-)<br />Anyway, never having been to India I guess I can be less critical of the less-than-authentic aspects mentioned. But I have recently read the 3-volume autobiography of author MM Kaye who was born and raised in India and spent much of her young adult life there as well. She was born in 1908 so her life coincided with the era of this novel. She frequently spoke of and referred to speaking Hindustani and said it was a shame no one seemed to speak in anymore as they had in her youth. According to her book Hindustani is NOT Hindi, but a language that combined elements of Hindi and Urdu, so I admit I just took that reference in the book for granted.<br />Anyway, I still look forward to additional novels by Cleverly, and can't wait for the second to come out in paperback. I hope that we will learn more about Joe as the series progresses.	2003-09-17

I agree with the other reviewers that the author(s) really make a royal hash of the British titles, alternately referring to the same character as Lord &quot;surname&quot; and then as Lord &quot;first name&quot; - yet the same person would NEVER go by both of those. Charles, as a peer, would never EVER be referred to a Lord Charles, and it would be terribly gauche to do so. A prince is never Your Majesty.<br />These are pretty simple things that even an American like me can figure out and understand, yet the author(s) screw this up every time in book after book.<br />However if I just grit my teeth and bear it the rest of the book is funny and informative, a &quot;light&quot; read, so I guess I cannot expect too much accuracy. But fun. Brain candy.	2003-05-11

The plotting intricacies of the quest for the legendary Yasmina Pass, and the dance for power between the British and the Russians was well-handled. I would rate the book five stars for that alone.<br />However it was all bound up with a totally dreadful love story between high-spirited Emma and the awful Damien. Sure we learn more about Damien later on that is supposed to make us like him more, but I don't feel anything excuses the things he says, and the way he treats Emma - espousing the viewpoint that a man has \\"needs\\" so is perfectly within his rights to have mistresses, but that an unfaithful wife deserves to be beaten, slapping Emma roundly during one of their early meetings, manipulating circumstances to force Emma into marrying him very much against her will, all but raping her on their wedding night, forcing her to pack up and leave Delhi immediately after the wedding despite the fact that her best friend is getting married in two weeks and Emma has been involved in all the long planning and was to be maid of honor, ordering Emma around as if she was a wayward child ......<br />Sorry, nothing I learned about Damien later on ever made me forgive him that beginning, and the hardest thing for me to grasp was the way Emma began to soften towards him although he never gave her any reason to. For this dumb romance part of the book I would give it one star.<br />So 1 star for the romance and 5 stars for the rest of the plot which I truly did enjoy gives an average of 3. Now trying to decide if I should risk another of Ms. Ryman's books!	2003-04-22

I grew up in a house filled with books and was always an avid reader. One rainy day I was browsing through my parents' bookshelves looking for something to read, and found Shadow of the Moon. The title caught my eye, so I took it out, and after the first page I was hooked. I could not put the book down until I had finished! I read it many times over my teenage years, and my young 20's.<br />Then, after the success of Kaye's The far Pavillions, they reissued this book in an expanded version. I had to buy my own copy and loved it even more than the original. I've never been a fan of &quot;romance&quot; as a genre, preferring mysteries and SciFi, and historical fiction, but I do enjoy a touch of romance in my novels, as long as that is not the total purpose of the book. And this one just fits the bill. An interesting romance but set against the background of the Indian Sepoy Rebellion of 1857. The history really takes center stage, and I loved that part of it.<br />This book was that one that triggered a lifetime fascination with India, and also led me to read many other books on the subject, as well as all the other books by author M.M. Kaye. I've enjoyed all of them, but this one remains my favorite.	2003-04-12

Those who didn't seem to like it appeared to have expected more from the book than it was meant to do. It was not meant to be a full-fledged novel as the other books in the series are. It was meant to be an interlude, a love story, a peek into a episode that undoubtedly many readers had clamored for. And in that regard it succeeded admirably. It is a sweet and enjoyable read, giving us a brief peek at many favorite characters during a special time in their lives.	2002-07-17
US	51886945	R1JHUXRJBL162C	192961375X	151736276	The Divided Child	Books	3	22	24	N	Y	not bad for a debut novel - but could be better	Miss Nikas's book is very much in the tradition of the incomparable Mary Stewart, and indeed she even uses the same setting, the Greek island of Corfu, that Stewart did in This Rough Magic. Her heroine is even surnamed Stewart which seems a sort of homage to her literary ancestress. However the books falls a bit short of Mary Stewart in her heyday. Corfu is a setting that came alive in This Rough Magic, but which falls flat here for for some reason. The setting never seems to come to life and Miss Nikas does not have Miss Stewart's gift for descriptive narrative.<br />And as others have said, much of the plot is far-fetched, especially for a 21st century setting. The heroine's meeting with the young boy at the center of the plot is forced and unlikely. Modern children should know full-well that they should not speak to strangers, rather than cozy up to them and become their tour guides.<br />Additionally, the boy's reason for being at the spot where the heroine meets him is far-fetched and unlikely when eventually revealed. It was a difficult feat for a 9-year-old to accomplish to be there, and the person who asked him to do it should have known such a thing would be very diffcult and have suggested a far easier and more convenient meeting place.<br />As others have said, no 21st century woman would be very likely to force herself into the home of a complete stranger who dislikes her and a playboy who lusts after her. A silly and odd thing for a young woman to do. And the way the heroine treats the purported hero of the book makes me crazy to the point of wanting to slap her upside the head.<br />But despite some serious flaws the books moves along excitingly if you are willing to suspend belief a little bit. The plot is complex and satisfying. I can't rate this book at highly as I would the books of Mary Stewart, but I enjoyed it quite well enough that if Miss Nikas produces another I would certainly give it a try.	2002-07-01

It finally took the internet to find it for me, from a bookstore in Wales, and I am grateful for that. I'm glad to have it because I love Mary Stewart and wanted a copy for my Stewart Collection, but it does not live up to her full-length novels.<br />The setting is exotic and fascinating, but there are just not enough pages here to fully develop the heroine, the hero, or any of their motivation for why they do some of the things they do. I wish Stewart had taken the time to flesh this out into a full-fledged novel. At twice the number of pages, with all the additional detail that entails, it probably would have been a fantastic book. But at a scant 96 pages it is only an echo of Stewart's far better books, of which there are many.<br />If you are a rabid Stewart fan I would certainly recommend this one to round out your collection, but if you are new to Stewart this is not the book I would start with. Try some of her earlier wonderful books set in Greece, France and the UK.	2002-06-25

It was exciting and kept me turning pages, but was ultimately unsatisfying.<br />The beginning was fine and eerie with the mysterious scientist in the desert, and the Najavo doctor and policeman who feel there is something suspicious about his death - but that all peters out to nothing and they are never seen again. We never do learn what caused his last fatal trip back to the past, or how he came to be wandering aimlessly in the desert upon his return. Instead we find ourselves transported to modern France, and then quickly to medieval France. The heroes are involved in one heart-stopping disaster after another as each chapter heading registers the ticking of the chronometer that counts down their allowable 37 hours in the medieval period.<br />They can't get fully immersed in the period in a mere 37 hours, so everything whizzes by at a rapid pace although one suspects from the beginning that their rescue will not be affected until the chronometer registers 00:00:02 or so. All the non-stop action is exhausting and prevents one from really having any feel for the medieival period. There is an extensive bibliography but not much to show for all that research as things move too fast to really give one a feeling of authenticity. It will probably make an exciting movie though, which is probably what Crichton was planning for all along.<br />But I much preferred Crichton's own \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" for an interesting look at medieval times. And specifically for time travel to the 14th century I would recommend Connie Willis' \\"Doomsday Day\\" far more highly than this one.	2002-06-04
US	51886945	RKLVPX87DJRYA	0515131210	927649912	Shattered	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Better than his last few	I've been a Dick Francis fan for nearly 30 years - so much so that in the mid-70's I began buying his books in hardback, something I do for very few authors. For years I was not disappointed, but eventually the quality of the books began to go seriously downhill. I still bought them in hardback, but began to hate myself for doing so.<br />Finally, after Second Wind, I said &quot;no more&quot; I won't subject myself to this pain again. However I couldn't stay completely away, however, and bought Shattered when it came out in paperback.<br />The good news: It is far better than the last few books Francis has written, several steps above Second Wind, and a completely different category from the truly dreadful 10-Lb. Penalty. It has much more of a ring of his earlier novels, and has a nice love interest, an interesting profession for the hero (glassblower), typical scenes from all Francis novels - the obligatory hero being beaten up scene, the obligatory hero keeping a stiff upper lip and refusing help from police, doctors or anyone even though bleeding on the floor scene.<br />The bad news: The villians don't seem fully fleshed-out, their motives never truly understood. The object of their goal seems a bit peculiar.<br />But all in all, if this is to be the last Francis novel I'd much rather have him go out with this one, than the last two awful ones before this. This is closer to the Francis roots. But for a a better read go back to the older Francis novels. Anything from the early 1990's and earlier should be pretty safe, though of course some are better than others.	2001-09-28

Its format and sturdiness made it easy to carry with me without the map breaking down, and it was so easy to read, and to locate everything I wanted. I used it for years, and then - sadly - lost it.<br />I returned to New York and checked various bookstores there, and no one carried copies of it anymore, so I was thrilled to discover it on Amazon, and promptly ordered a new copy.

We have been readers for several generations, and I grew up with many of these books. One of these books was a novel called &quot;The Heart of Hyacinth&quot; by an author mysteriously named Onoto Watanna. The author was unknown to me, but I thought the book was one of the most beautiful of all the books I'd inherited, with lovely Japanese-style illustrations and drawings.<br />But now I've had a chance to learn about the woman who lurked behind that exotic nom de plume. I learn she was not Japanese at all, but half Chinese and half English. Yet her true story seems to be as fully exotic as any of the character's lives from her books.<br />Diana Birchall has done a wonderful job of bringing her fascinating grandmother to life. The book give a wonderful look at a most unusual woman, and what life was like for young women at the turn of the last century. At least what life was like when the young women were as self-confident and gutsy as the young Winnifred Eaton.	2001-09-25

If you have not yet read this book I suggest you don't read many of the amazon reviews. Many of the reviews give away every single major plot point. I find this very disappointing and am glad I did not read many reviews before I read the book, as much of the power and gut-wrenching effect come from discovering the answers yourself as the story unfolds.

I loved this book, but when I read of the Sorcerer's Stone I had a nagging feeling about it at the back of my mind, until it struck me that all the  descriptions of it matched what I had always known as a Philosopher's  Stone. I first learned of the Philosopher's Stone when I was 10 years old  and read a book called &quot;Gone-Away Lake&quot; by Elizabeth Enright, and  then of course read more of it when studying European history.<br />As the  Encyclopedia Brittanica puts it: &quot;in alchemy, substance thought to be  capable of changing base metals into gold. The same term, more fully elixir  vitae, &quot;elixir of life,&quot; was given to the substance that would  indefinitely prolong life--a liquid that was believed to be allied with the  philosopher's stone.&quot;<br />I was quite confused, but then I discovered  that it England the book *was* originally called &quot;Harry Potter and the  Philosopher's Stone&quot;. This title makes so much more sense. What the  heck is a sorcerer's stone? Nothing. Why the change? Does Scholastic Books  just think American's are dumb, ignorant fools? I can't think of any other  reason for the change.<br />I do know that from now on I will buy my copies  of the books from the British publisher, rather than the &quot;dumbed  down&quot; American versions put out by Scholastic.	2000-08-16

It was torture, but well worth it. The Crystal Cave was a  marvelous book, but each book in the series is marvelous. Mary Stewart is  one of my favorite authors. Merlin truly comes to life in this book as he  has in no other. The only other book I have read that addresses Merlin is  Stephen Lawhead's and that series, while decent, is merely a pale imitation  of the depth and power of Stewart's series.

This one in particular made me want to go  to Greece and see Delphi and The Charioteer. Five years ago when I finally  beheld The Charioteer myself and stood on the theater at Delphi and looked  out over the mountains my first thoughts were of Mary Stewart. I recommend  this book highly to anyone who can find a copy of it. It is well worth  because it is a marvelous read as are all of Mary Stewart's earlier books.<br />Sadly it appears that most of her early wonderful books are out of  print, and the only ones still available are mainly the later and less  skillful novels - though a few of the good early ones are still  available.<br />Look for this one.

I am a middle-aged woman of 46 who had never read any fantasy literature other than The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings many years ago, until I was introduced to the genre by my teenage son some 6 years ago or so.<br />Since  then I have read many of the books in the genre as my son pushed them on me  - Eddings, Feist, Jordan, Brooks, to name just a few, and overall I have  enjoyed them.<br />This book, however, I picked out on my on back in the  summer of 1997, and when I began reading it I could not put it down. I have  enjoyed many fantasy books and series, especially Robert Jordan's Wheel of  Time, but they all seem like trivial kiddie literature compared to A Game  of Thrones. I cannot remember the last time a book has gripped me so. I  could not put it down. The book is certain dark and violent, but not  gratuitously so - it was a dark and violent age and land. The characters  are marvelous, the story line complex and fascinating. My only regret is  how long I have had to wait for the sequel.<br />When I read the first book I  thouht it was the first of 3, but now I hear it is to be the a 6-book  series. I'll be old and white-haired by the time I finish! The only book I  have read which has affected me like this is Frank Herbert's Dune which I  first read at age 13 back in 1965, and have reread probably a dozen times  since then. I cannot recommend this book highly enough, but it is not for  the squeamish or prudish.	1999-02-25

However both books proved that  you cannot really recreate another's unique style, but Black Coffee much  more so than the other. In the hands of Agatha Christie herself  I'm sure  this would have been a stylish mystery, but here is is merely a pale  imitation, a ghostly image of what might have been. The characters are  cardboard and lifeless. The writing does not have the unique verve and  humor of Agatha Christie. The plot seems obvious and forced in scenes where  you are forced to witness a certain character's actions, which I presume is  a result of following the stage directions. It would have been much more  subtle if Dame Agatha had written it herself. Instead it is merely  serviceable. Agatha Christie is one author whose books I reread again and  again just for the sheer pleasure of her writing style, but I have no  desire to reread Black Coffee. I'm sorry I wasted the money to buy it in  hardback	1998-10-12

I decided to check out the Neanderthin book after a long plateau while following the Protein Power diet. I had lost 64 lbs, but then stalled and seemed unable to lose any more although I still had a long way to go. I read about Neanderthin and decided to buy the book (via Amazon) and give it a try. I started just a week ago and have quickly lost 6 lbs - a miracle after my long plateau on PP. Plus I feel good, and full of energy. My son has also decided to go with the Neanderthin plan. I feel much healthier not eating all that processed junk most Americans eat.	1998-05-08

The low carb diet has truly been a lifesaver for me. I have lost 64 lbs in the last 10 months following this plan, and I have never felt better. I have more energy that I have had in 20 years. I feel like a kid again, and all my other vital signs are improving too, cholesterol, blood pressure, blood sugar. I have tried and failed on other diets many times over the last 25 years. This time I am succeeding. God bless Dr. Atkins	1998-04-02
