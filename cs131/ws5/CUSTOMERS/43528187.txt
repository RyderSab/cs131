ZIPCODE SEARCH Feature is excellent IF INFORMATION were ACCURATE!<br /><br />I lived in several places for relatively long period of time: San Francisco--6 years and Minnesota 3 years. However, I found the stat inaccurate. For example, the area that I live (Richmond disctrict) is one of the safer areas in the city in contrast to the bayview/bayshore area (which has lots of happenings and many shootings over the past years and news reported that cops were reluctant to petrol those areas). While the zipcode search reflects that the safer district has as many violent crimes and murders as the relatively known dangerous areas. This is something that needed to be worked on further. I am sure the book like this kind is useful but accuracy information counts!	2004-12-17

I was quite passionate for a career in the academics. But after reading the book, I decided to try other choices because I don't want to spend 4 years as an undergraduate, 5 years OR MORE as a graduate student, and then 2 years or more as postdoc and another 5 or more years as an assistant professor waiting for the tenure while being paid like $50,000-55,000 a year!!! This is crazy and unfair! My friend with an MBA has $70,000 as beginning salary! Suppose I can be a full professor at an above average research university, I probably would get paid just $70k a year! Why should I waste so much time (at least 20 years!!) earning so little and engaging myself into such a fierce competitive academic world! I do thank the author for telling us about the path of being a professor of math. He also lists many other governmental and private companies' positions that are more attracting than the professorship, and that's what I am going for!<br />In summary:<br />First of all, you got to pass the qualifying exams, which are harder than the William Lowell Putnam Mathemtics Competition. Then, you have to spend 4-6 years writing a good thesis! If your thesis is not significant enough, you may have a very tough time finding a plum job. Even if you have produced an important thesis, you have show yourself constantly and actively working on your field subjects. You then may have an assistant professorship on the tenure track--waiting for the vote of the faculty members, and approval of the dean, the provost and then the Chancellor. The process is kinda of harsh.<br />But as the author says &quot;One of the best things about a degree in mathematics--at any level--is that it opens many doors and closes few of them. It gives you a world of opportunities from which to choose.&quot; Good luck to us who love math! Wish us well.	2003-11-12
