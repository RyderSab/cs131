US	53096389	RJMX2SOBI7LA	0553382136	824871262	Spin State	Books	4	2	2	N	Y	An outstanding science fiction novel	There are some science fiction novels, like Neal Asher's The Skinner, that are set in a world that is so fascinating that shallowly drawn characters do seriously not hurt the readability of the novel. The world of Spin State is outlined, but never quite fully detailed. The main setting, a planet called Compson's World, has the gritty feel of an Appalachian coal mining town. Spin State does not rely on the flash of strange worlds, but rather on a finely drawn and complex main character, Catherine Li.<br /><br />In Spin State something bad has happened to the Earth. Humans are no longer able to inhabit the planet on a full time basis. Humanity has spread out through the Galaxy, in huge orbital habitats and on terraformed alien worlds. One of these is Compson's World. The humans who originally settled these worlds are genetically engineered, raised in creches. The engineered humans are tougher and stronger, allowing them to survive better in the hostile environment of an alien world in the early states of terraforming.<br /><br />Eventually the natural, unengineered, humans that follow rebel against the engineered competition that they feel they can't compete with. Further engineering of the human gene set is banned. Humans with engineered gene sets are not allowed the same rights and are not allowed to travel freely.<br /><br />Catherine Li, the central character of Spin State does not come from standard human stock. As a baby she is adopted and raised on Compson's World by two natural human parents. She manages to escape the griding poverty of the mining planet and join the United Nations peacekeeping force.<br /><br />Catherine Li joins the United Nations peacekeepers during a war with the Syndicate, an offshoot of the human race that has embraced engineered humanity. She rises to the rank of Major, but her background as an engineered human haunts her.<br /><br />Spin State on the surface is a murder mystery. Catherine Li is sent to Compson's World, a place she has promised herself she would never return to, on a mission to find the murderer of Hannah Sharifi, a physicist whose work has allowed faster than light communication and travel. Hannah Sharifi is an engineered human and although she is a physicist on the level of Einstein or Schrodinger, she was never treated with the full rights that a natural human would have.<br /><br />As the plot of Spin State unfolds the various facets Catherine Li's personality and story emerge. Li is a strong and at times brutal person, whose hard edges are a result of her background and her will to survive. By the end of the book, Catherine has become more than a warrior.<br /><br />At the end of Spin State Chris Moriarty includes a number of references from physics, philosophy and artificial intelligence. The book frequently refers to Bose-Einstein condensates. In the book this is an exotic form of matter that can only be found on Compson's World. In our world Bose-Einstein condensates exist as a state of matter that is very near absolute zero. Bose-Einstein condenstates are a unique state of matter where all atoms exist in the same quantum state. However, if a Bose-Einstein condensate warms up even a little bit over its fractional closeness to absolute zero, its unique properties disapear.<br /><br />The room temperature Bose-Einstein condensates in Spin State are the medium for faster than light communication and travel. Compson's World is of critical strategic importance because it is the only source for this exotic material. This also makes the supply of Bose-Einstein condensates a finite resource in the face of growing demand. Before she was murdered, Hannah Sharifi was working on a technique to grow artificial room temperature Bose-Einstein condensates.<br /><br />The science underlying the plot of Spin State is somewhat tangential. The rare Bose-Einstein condensates of Compson's World provide a plot motivation, but they are not central to the plot. The character of Catherine Li is what draws the reader in and makes this book so good.<br /><br />The plot of Spin State is complicated, at times to the point of obscurity. Wealthy people and people in the military, like Catherine Li, have neural implants throughout their central nervous system. This somehow allows them to experience virtual reality, but the details in Spin State are rather vague (for a science fiction book which revolves almost entirely around virtual reality, see Karl Schroeder's Lady of Mazes). There are a few scenes where Catherine is eating at an expensive resturant, via virtual reality, which has a strange feel about it. After all, even the most expensive virtual oysters are still just an illusion, even if you can taste them and feel them slide down your throat. All that it takes to produce a virtual oyster is the right neural hardware and large amounts of compute power. A real oyster, grown in an off-world habitat may be a different thing entirely.<br /><br />There is another point in the story line where Catherine is attacked in virtual reality by an artificial intelligence. Thinking back, it is not clear to me what this entity was and I'm not sure we ever clearly find out (I think I know, but I'm not sure).<br /><br />Perhaps the complexity and obscurity of the plot are the result of Spin State being Chris Moriarty's first novel. Complex plots are fascinating, but what drives the story is the core story line.<br /><br />[Later... Feb 2015]<br /><br />Chris Moriarty's books are densely plotted and based on a great deal of background reading. So, sadly, they are slow to come out. I just bought a copy of [[ASIN:0553384945 Ghost Spin]]. But after a decade I've found that some of the details faded for me (although the coal/condensate mines stuck in my memory). So I read Spin State again. I liked it even more, although the second time I still found the mix of virtual reality and reality confusing (eating the oysters, as I mentioned above). Chris Moriarty is a rare talent and I was left wondering \\"who is this woman\\".<br /><br />In a lot of way Spin State reminded me of [[ASIN:0441569595 Neuromancer]] by William Gibson. Fans of Neuromancer have asked Gibson to wrote something else like it. He said that this is not possible. Neuromancer came out of his youth. He pointed out that all of the authority figures were killed off.<br /><br />In Spin State all of the authority figures are killed. Catherine Li is an angry figure in many ways. A tough girl who is trying to hold it together. A bit like Case or Molly in Neuromancer.tate is complicated, at times to the point of obscurity.

On his honeymoon, only a few classes short of graduation, Crawford got word that his National Guard unit would be sent to Iraq to support the US and British invasion (which took place on March 20, 2003). Crawford was in Iraq for more than a year.<br /><br />The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell is structured as a set of short stories that recount some of Crawford's experiences in Iraq. This is a successful format for recounting an experience that had little logic while Crawford was living it and probably less in retrospect.<br /><br />Generals and journalist try to write accounts that provide some global view of events. Crawford's account is that of an infantryman on the ground, in the dust, dirt and fear. The book opens with a story about the invasion. Crawford's unit was trapped with a few other units in a dust storm. As night falls, with zero visibility and no anti-tank weapons, they are told that an Iraqi tank unit is headed their way. The dust is everywhere, clogging their weapons, which in any case would do little damage to the Soviet era tanks used by the Iraqi army. Crawford never finds out whether the tanks pass by his unit or just never show up in the area.<br /><br />Crawford's unit spends the rest of their time in Iraq attempting to provide security in Baghdad. Several of his stories involve the time his unit spent policing two Iraqi gas stations. The Iraq that Crawford describes is a shattered third world country. The Baghdad he inhabited was a city of hovels and crumbling apartments. A dangerous city of dust and filth. The overall color is the brown of desert sand, a city almost devoid of trees. Crawford's picture of Iraq brings home the surreal absurdity of the Bush administration's claim that Iraq was a \\"clear and present\\" danger to the United States, a country with a population over ten times that of Iraq, thousands of nuclear weapons and the most powerful military in existence.<br /><br />Crawford's accounts are gripping, giving the reader some feel for his experience in Iraq. Crawford and his fellow National Guardsmen are bored, scared and desperately homesick. As National Guardsmen they are treated as second class soldiers. Their body armor is vintage of Vietnam era. Their officers are less well trained and less able than the regular Army officers. They are shifted from unit to unit, their Iraq departure date sifting with little obvious logic.<br /><br />The enemy in Iraq is not an opposing army, but fighters who blend into the population. Crawford and his comrades are shot at from buildings and from the roadside by men who sometimes seem like ghosts. Crawford writes of the hate that is sometimes directed their way. The response to Iraq of these young, heavily armed men ranges from generous to brutal. Crawford gives the reader the feeling that without the oversight of the officers above these young men, there would be unrestrained carnage. They want to leave this strange land they have been sent to. Crawford writes that he would gladly kill an arbitrary number of Iraqis if it would get him home twenty minutes sooner.<br /><br />Crawford's picture of himself and his fellows is not a picture of noble warriors. Their time in Iraq makes them desperate and brutal. Yet they are at their core honorable. The men and women in the US military are fulfilling the promises they have made. The brutality that emerges is the brutality that lives in all human hearts. As in any war, the military men and women in Iraq pay a terrible price. The toll exacted from them is not just death and physical injury. Marriages are shattered, businesses ruined and many of them will never be the same. Crawford writes of downing Valium by the handful, along with cheap Turkish whiskey and on one occasion beer taken from the Iraqis. As his stories unfold his marriage breaks up. By the end of his account, the blackness closes in on Crawford.<br /><br />The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell is a short book. The stories sometimes repeat detail that Crawford has related earlier. This gives the book the feeling of a collection of reprinted stories. Perhaps because the details are simply too painful, some parts of the story are obscure. Crawford's wife, Stephanie, slowly draws away from him as the story progresses. Crawford's dream of a Penelope welcoming home her Ulysses is just that, a dream. But the reader never finds out what happens.<br /><br />The Last True Story I'll Ever Tell and the other books by Iraq veterans that are starting to appear are important reminders of the sacrifices that our country is asking of our sons and daughters who are serving in the military. We owe them more than a \\"support our troops\\" bumper sticker. As a nation we should listen to their stories and hear of the price they have paid in our service. As a nation we should ask why they are paying this price. We should ask why a war that was started over Weapons of Mass Destruction became a war to install democracy and finally a war to install an \\"Islamic Republic\\" which may turn out to be no more democratic than its ally Iran.rriage breaks up.

Today they are active cities that not only attract tourists, but have modern industry and culture. Venice is the old bones of an imperial power. The palaces, churches and art that exists in Venice are the relics of Venice's past wealth and power. Today Venice exists as a cultural tourist attraction.<br /><br />In planning to visit Venice, I've worried that it is a sort of cultural Disneyland. A place that exists only for tourists.<br /><br />When I think about traveling somewhere, I hope that it will be a wonderful experience. So I try to learn as much about a place as possible. Travel essays provide at least one person's view of a place. Venice by James Morris is a rich account of Venice and its history. Reading the book, I felt that I could feel the city through Morris' perspective.<br /><br />James Morris was one of the early transexuals and became Jan Morris, the noted travel writer. Venice was originally written when Jan was James and she did not change the authorship with later editions. From reading the introduction, I think that this is because in Jan's view James really did write the book. This was an earlier avitar of Jan's and she wishes to honor his perspective.<br /><br />Jan Morris is a wonderful, lyrical writer. Reading her writing, I feel a bit like I'm walking the canals and experiencing Venice. Reading this book made me much more sure about my decision to visit these old bones of empire.	2005-07-25

The country is so large and so different from region to region: the San Francisco Bay Area to Huntsville Alabama.<br /><br />Italy is a far smaller country than the United States, both in geographical area and in population. But a book on Italian society can still only provide an impressionist sketch of Italy, which is complex in its own right. The New Italians by Charles Richards is just such an impressionist sketch. The book is well written and engaging, with the exception of the last chapters which I found dragged.<br /><br />Richards writes of modern Italy, since the Second World War. He provides an interesting description of Italian attitudes, Italian politics and bureaucracy, which Richards describes as largely dysfunctional. His description of getting anything official done dovetails with the description in A Thousand Days in Venice of Ms. de Blasi and her fiance getting a marriage license (they only succeeded when her fiance lied to the official, telling her that Ms. de Blasi wrote for The New York Times and would write about how she could not get a marriage license).<br /><br />After describing the dysfunctional nature of most Italian cities, Richards describes Bologna, a city run by reformed Communists which runs better than most cities in Italy. Bologna (which I'm planning to visit) seems to be a bit like Catalonia: a mix of socialism with an affection of the good things in life and the willingness to work hard for them.<br /><br />There is a fairly long section on the various Italian Mafias (La Cosa Nostra of Sicily, the Camorra of Naples and the 'ndrangheta of Calabria). Richards covers the Italian Mafia because, like the cocaine cartels in Columbia, the Mafia has infiltrated Italian society, all the way up to some of the Prime Ministers, some allege. Better coverage of the Mafia and the courageous Sicilians who have fought it can be found in Excellent Cadavers by Alexander Stille.rs by Alexander Stille.	2005-07-24
US	53096389	R2R44YZM9DNKFN	8877431733	600550584	Venice and Food	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A beautiful book of art, history and the character of Venice	I purchased this book soon after it came out. I found it at the wonderful Kepler's bookstore in Menlo Park, California in among the cookbooks. Which makes sense, because, in part Venice & Food is a cookbook. But Venice & Food is two other thing as well: a book about Venice and its history and an art book of Ms. Spector's remarkable drawings of Venice. What is also remarkable about this book is that it is not typeset. The book is entirely written in Ms. Spector's hand printed text and the illustrations are annotated with her script.<br /><br />Ms. Spector is a wonderful artist and her drawings of Venice are beautiful. The drawings illustrate essays on topics ranging from where Venice gets its fresh water to the history of corn in Europe and Venice. Since this is a cookbook, Ms. Spector also writes about the history of food and cooking in Venice, including a few accounts of modern food. In writing about food and cooking through history, Ms. Spector comments that for the vast majority of people through most of human history, the concern was not about the sensuality of food, but simply having a full stomach.<br /><br />The beautiful artwork, the observations about Venice, its history and its food are what make this book a treasure. I am sad to say that I read the book cover to cover and did not find a recipe that I wanted to make. Although I will not be using this as a cookbook, I will always treasure the book for its beauty.	2005-07-24

In A Thousand Days in Venice she writes that she first visited Venice as a result of a writing assignment from a magazine (she was reluctant to leave Rome at the time). Ms. de Blasi has written two cookbooks on Italian food: Regional Foods of Northern Italy and Regional Foods of Southern Italy.<br /><br />After her initial reluctance Ms. de Blasi visited Venice a number of times. On what turns out to be her last visit as a tourist, a Venetian tells her that he has fallen in love with her, on sight. The Venetian turns out to be Fernando, who is a bank manager in Venice. Ms. de Blasi speaks functional italian, but she is not fluent. Fernando's english is probably not even as good as Ms. de Blasi's italian. She and Fernando spend a few hours walking the streets of Venice talking. Fernando saw Ms. de Blasi the year before, walking with a man (who Ms. de Blasi never explains). He is smitten by here and can't forget her. Then he sees her a year later. He is sure that it is Destiny. There meeting again is not coincidence. It is True Love, the bolt out of the blue.<br /><br />Ms. de Blasi is leaving Venice, but she promises to come back, explaining that if there really is something between them, a few months will not make any difference. In the mean time they can write and talk on the phone. Eighteen days after Ms. de Blasi returns to Saint Louis, Missouri Fernando arrives at her house.<br /><br />Ms. de Blasi never tells us exactly when Fernando asks her to marry him, but we find her planning to uproot her life and move to Venice. She sells her recently remodeled house and her share in a cafe where she is the chef. She leaves behind her two grown children and all that is familiar to go off an marry Fernando.<br /><br />I'm one of those people who tries to plan things before I do them. I can't imagine throwing everything aside and moving to Venice to marry someone I really hardly know. To my cynical eye the story has the flavor of a midlife crisis. Fernando has been a functionary in a sinecure job at an Italian bank that his father originally arranged for me. He reaches middle age and feels that life is draining away. He sees Ms. de Blasi and believes that she and all that she represents will save him. Ms. de Blasi is one of those admirable people who is willing to take risks and jump into the unknown.<br /><br />There are, of course, the usual stories of adjusting to a new culture and place. The difficulty that Fernando and Ms. de Blasi have in gaining a marriage license is an Italian classic. I bought A Thousand Days in Venice to get a feeling for Venice, the place, and I was not disappointed. Ms. de Blasi does not work at a job in Venice and so spends some of her time alone walking around the city and exploring Venice's archives. Some of this experience comes through in the book.<br /><br />An even better book is James Morris' book \\"Venice\\".  Morris<br /><br />is an even better writer than Ms. de Blasi and has spent<br /><br />considerably more than 1000 days in Venice.ing everything aside and moving to Venice to marry someone I really hardly know.

Lewis was a professor of American Literature at Yale. He died at the age of 84, in 2002. Although Lewis lived in the United States, Florence was a city that he and his family visited for much of his life. Lewis spent some time in Italy growing up. During World War II he was in Italy with the OSS (the forerunner to the CIA). Lewis was on a boat which was sunk by the Germans and he managed to swim to land and evade capture until he reached the allied lines. Lewis was in Florence again after it was captured by the Allies. He returned over the years with his family.<br /><br />Lewis' The City of Florence is both a biography of Lewis' experience in Florence and the history of the city. Lewis' historical sketches cover the city from medieval times to modern times (Lewis describes one of the modern floods of the Arno, the river that runs through Florence).<br /><br />The City of Florence is not a travel guide. Lewis explored Florence in a random fashion, as anyone does when they live in a place. He discusses some of his favorite museums and places to walk, but it would be difficult to plan a trip based on this book. Instead what you get is some of Lewis' feeling for the Florence he loves.<br /><br />Lewis never does write about exactly why he loves the city. Perhaps he considers it obvious. For example, why Florence and not Siena. Lewis even likes Florence in August, when most Florentine residents flee the city if they can. He does not comment on Florence's notorious traffic and he comments only a little on the struggle to preserve Florence in the face of modern development.<br /><br />If you are planning on visiting Florence, The City of Florence is probably worth reading to get a feel for the city. Lewis' historical sketches of Florence are engaging and would also be a good preparation for a visit.	2005-07-24

I really liked Charles Stross' \\"Singularity Sky\\", so I purchased<br /><br />\\"The Atrocity Archives\\".  \\"The Atrocity Archives\\" is a much<br /><br />weaker book.  Stross takes a few premises (magic exists as<br /><br />as suppressed science, all of the major countries have groups<br /><br />in charge of magic suppression, great scientists and mathematicians<br /><br />have stumbled on the keys to this suppressed knowledge) and builds<br /><br />a book without much in the way of characters or even plot.  The<br /><br />book is really just a sequence of episodes.  The plot centers<br /><br />around a guy who is basicly a system administrator who gets<br /><br />drafted into the larger work of technology suppression and<br /><br />The Fight Against Evil.  The book reads like a collection<br /><br />of stories, which perhaps it was.<br /><br />Stross mentions that while he was writing The Atrocity<br /><br />Archives, Tim Powers book \\"Declare\\" was published.  \\"Declare\\"<br /><br />has a similar plot, but a much stronger story line and stronger<br /><br />characters.	2004-12-03

I'm sure that there are people who would find John<br /><br />Shirley's Demons a profound and wonderful book.<br /><br />If you believe in astral projection, groups of hidden illuminati,<br /><br />reincarnation, occult forces acting in this world and you're<br /><br />a teenager you might think that this is a great book.<br /><br />The \\"profound\\" part of Shirley's book Demons comes from his<br /><br />commentary on the apparently limitless evil and greed that<br /><br />the human race is capable of.  However, this evil and greed<br /><br />is offset by \\"the forces of good\\".  This particular plot<br /><br />outline is not enough to doom a book in the hands of a good<br /><br />writer.  For example, Tim Power's book \\"Declare\\" deals with<br /><br />similar topics and is a much better book than \\"Demons\\".<br /><br />What dooms Shirley's book is that this basic plot theme is<br /><br />shallowly filled out and populated by wooden characters.<br /><br />Perhaps Shirley has been writing for television for too<br /><br />long.<br /><br />I got the feeling that Shirley had either become a \\"new age\\"<br /><br />convert or was writing for those who were.  I imagine the<br /><br />fans of \\"Demons\\" as being teenagers into New Age occultism<br /><br />and black clothing.  \\"It's so profounds they way he comments<br /><br />on the evil in the world...\\".<br /><br />John Shirley was part of a wave of science fiction writers<br /><br />who seemed to follow in the wake of William Gibson (author<br /><br />of the classic work Neuromancer).  I remember his Eclipse<br /><br />trilogy as being much better than Demons.  Perhaps I remember<br /><br />the Eclipse books as being much better than they are.  Or<br /><br />perhaps John Shirley's sojurn in Hollywood has damaged him<br /><br />as a writer.	2004-12-03

When I saw Emanuel Derman's book on Amazon, I immediately ordered it. I expected a book like The Mind of Wall Street by Leon Levy: an interesting and informative read. I was not disappointed: I learned something about what it is like to work at a large Wall Street firm and about quantitative finance (in particular valuation of derivatives). But I also found a book which was very well written and engaging. My Life as a Quant was an unexpected pleasure.<br /><br />My Life as a Quant recounts the evolution of Derman's life, from his youth in Cape Town, South Africa to the Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs where Derman spent most of seventeen years working in quantitative finance. The trajectory of Derman's life between these two points passed through the graduate Physics program at Columbia University and a decade in postgraduate theoretical particle physics.<br /><br />My Life as a Quant is not a \\"confessional\\" autobiography. There is much about his inner life and experience that Derman keeps private. But he does give the reader a view of some of his inner struggles, both in his profession and in his search to find meaning and direction in his life.<br /><br />Wall Street companies provide some of the largest financial rewards available outside the rarefied levels of corporate executive suite. These rewards attract people like Emanuel Derman, who are some of the brightest people in the world (brilliance does not seem to be required of corporate executives). Derman was in the forefront of a wave of physicists who went to work on Wall Street. Like Derman, many of them left research and University life as jobs became more difficult to obtain.<br /><br />The most successful people on Wall Street are able to amass large fortunes. However, people like John Merriweather (of the Solomon Brothers bond group and a founder of Long Term Capital Management) seem to find that they cannot leave Wall Street. At their level the money is only a way to determine whether they are winning more losing. Win or lose, they cannot seem to imagine a life where they are not \\"players\\".<br /><br />Derman does not discuss his compensation at Goldman. I speculate that at a minimum he managed to put aside enough money to put his children through Ivy League schools. In the end, however, greed for more money and the draw of being a \\"player\\" had no hold on Derman. When he found something that would make him happier, he stepped away from Wall Street (although he did not leave it entirely).et.

For me that catagory includes the<br />painfully bad \\"Ordinary Horror\\" by David Searcy or any book by Clive Cussler.<br /><br />\\"Codex\\" is simply a weak novel.  The characters are wooden, the plot is uninspired.  It is interesting to compare \\"Codex\\" with the excellent \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by  Carlos Ruiz Zafon. In both novels, mysterious books play a central part.  But the characters in Zafon's book have depth and feeling.  This is entirely lacking in \\"Codex\\".<br /><br />I purchased this book because it was well reviewed in several places.  I have to speculate that this is because the author of \\"Codex\\" is a book reviewer himself.  Perhaps those who reviewed \\"Codex\\" worried that a harsh review would be returned by Mr. Grossman when he reviewed their book.  So they puffed<br />the review up.<br /><br />For my part, I recommend saving your money, or, if you must read this book check it out of the library.  I've sending mine off to the used book store.<br /><br />As a previous reviewer pointed out, when it comes to books and mystery, in addition to \\"Shadow of the Wind\\" I highly recommend Arturo Perez-Reverte's \\"Club Dumas\\".	2004-09-24

I consider these books intellectual noir,<br />whose plot revolves, in part, around a feme fatal.  The<br />beautiful faithless women in these book are one dimensional.<br />Even in &quot;The Nautical Chart&quot;, where the book revolves around<br />the beautiful Tanger, we never really get a feeling for who<br />she is.  Coy, the man who loves her, spends the book trying<br />to understand her.  But in the end Coy only has a collection<br />of observations that never really add up to a whole.<br />Having read two books by Perez-Reverte where the women were<br />beautiful and dangerous characters without full dimension<br />I wondered if Perez-Reverte could actually write about a<br />three dimensional women.  The answer has been provided in<br />&quot;The Queen of the South&quot;.<br />The central character is Teresa, a complex woman with a<br />complex history.  By the end of the book I felt that<br />Perez-Reverte has created a  character that could have lived<br />beyond the pages of the book. Before becoming a novelist<br />Perez-Reverte was a new reporter and it shows in this book.<br />When I finished reading the last page, I had the strange<br />feeling that the events recounted really could have happened<br />exactly as outlined.  This was reinforced by the fact that<br />Perez-Reverte has incorporated some actual people into his<br />story.<br />Teresa as a dark character and by the end of<br />the book she has blood on her hands.  Perhaps because<br />Perez-Reverte provides such an intimate portrait of Teresa<br />I was unable to see her as evil, despite some of her actions.<br />We see Teresa grow from a scared young woman to full adulthood<br />into a sophisticated woman.<br />The story of &quot;The Queen of the South&quot; is told by a reporter<br />and the detail in which the world of drug running is<br />described in amazing detail.  Like Fredrick Forsyth's &quot;Odessa<br />File&quot;, one is reading a novelization of actual reality.<br />The story is gripping.

He is<br />a man who was comfortable in the Nixon, Reagan and Bush I<br />administrations.  In short, Mr. O'Neill is a concervative.  Or<br />at least a concervative of the form that existed before the<br />Christian Right and unrestrained corporate interests took<br />control of the Republican Party.  To further emphasize this point<br />I'll note that O'Neill is a long time friend of the Chairman<br />of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan.  Until he worked in the<br />Bush II administration O'Neill was also a friend and colleague<br />of Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld.<br />O'Neill's background and connections make his criticisms of the<br />Bush II administration even more telling.  He portrays an<br />administration largely devoid of policy analysis and discussion.<br />An administration instead driven by ideology and the pursuit of<br />power.<br />It was Treasury Secretary O'Neill who was one of the first,<br />and certainly highest placed Bush II officials to write about<br />the Bush II administration's obcession with Iraq.  O'Neill<br />describes this obcession from the earliest days of the Bush<br />II rein.  Richard Clark, in his new book \\"Against All Enemies\\"<br />expands on this topic.  The Bush II administration has<br />attacked both O'Neill and Clark as unreliable.<br />This book is written by journalist Ron Suskind.  Ron Suskind<br />wrote an article in Esquire Magazine titled \\"Why Are These Men<br />Laughing?\\" on former domestic policy adviser John DiIulio.<br />After speaking out to Suskind DiIulio recanted, in a manner<br />that reminded me of the Soviet show trials.  Suskind and O'Neill<br />apparently came together as a result of the Esquire article.<br />O'Neill commented that he's an old rich guy and there is not<br />much that the Bush II administration can do to him.<br />Suskind is an able writer in telling O'Neill's story.  At times<br />the book drags.  O'Neill is a policy \\"wonk\\" and at times the<br />discussions of policy formation (or lack of it in the Bush II<br />administration) drags.  I borrowed the book from the library<br />(I spend so much money with Amazon that I try to keep my book<br />habbit under control).

A race against time or against forces that<br />outnumber the protagonist.  The suspense in &quot;The Last Six<br />Million Seconds&quot; is different.  The central character,<br />&quot;Charlie&quot; Chan is outnumbered by the forces surrounding him.<br />But he is more than willing to let go of his investigation<br />if told to do so by his British masters.  As with other<br />&quot;thrillers&quot; there is a mystery at the core of the story,<br />but this mystery is simply a center around which the powers<br />in the story orbit.  The suspense arises from plot elements<br />and the setting.<br />There are four forces which operate in the plot: the British,<br />the fading colonial masters of Hong Kong, the triads or tong,<br />China, which will take over Hong Kong and &quot;Charlie&quot; Chan,<br />a somewhat fanatic chief inspector of the Hong Kong Police.<br />The triads are supposed to be some of the most violent criminal<br />organizations in the world.  I read somewhere that they once<br />cut the arms off a journalist in a conference room where he<br />worked.  With the take over of Hong Kong by China the triads<br />have to adjust to the new power realities of another criminal<br />faction, the generals of the Red Army.  The fading British<br />Empire wants nothing more than to extract itself from Hong<br />Kong.  Like a cork floating in this stormy sea is inspector<br />Chan and his investigation.  The violence that is the<br />undercurrent in the story simply reflects the violence of the<br />triads and the Red Army.  Reading this book I not only was<br />reminded of the storied corruption of the Red Army but also<br />of the fact that China executes over 1,000 people a year,<br />taking them to killing fields and shooting them in the head.<br />The book also captures the Hong Kong obcession with making money.<br />This obcession with business and profit has historically made<br />much of the Hong Kong population apolitical.  While British<br />law and jury trials existed in Hong Kong, the British never<br />ran their colony in a democratic fashion.  The<br />rulers of Hong Kong were appointed in London, never elected.<br />So the assumption of power by China in some ways changed little,<br />at least on the surface.<br />The question that this book brings up,<br />but does not answer because it was published in 1997, is what<br />effect two lawless organizations, the triads and the Red Army,<br />have had on Hong Kong.  The politics and power structure of the<br />Middle Kingdom make the late Soviet Union appear transparent<br />by comparison.  The rule of law seems to be emerging slowly<br />in China.  Has the corruption, drug and arms trafficing changed<br />as well?<br />I read this book after reading Burdett's &quot;Bangkok 8&quot;.  Like<br />the excellent &quot;Bangkok 8&quot; this is a story of complex plot<br />and realistic characters.  As other reviews have noted, &quot;The<br />Last Six Million Seconds&quot; deserves to be in print.  I look<br />forward to more of Burdett's work..

US	53096389	R24WQZL26F1X4I	0380978938	591476242	Ilium	Books	3	9	10	N	N	An unfinished tale that may be some of Simmons' best work	A number of people have observed that the science fiction of the 1960s and 1970s was, at its core, optimistic. Although nuclear war lurked in the background, there was an optimism in the work of writers like Arthur C. Clarke and Theodore Sturgeon. Mankind was evolving toward something better. Our current stage of aggression and war was a childhood that, if we survived, we would outgrow. In the 1980s science fiction started to turn inward. William Gibson's Neuromancer was set is a distopian future, the work of an angry young man (according to Gibson's description). Dan Simmons became famous with his book Hyperion, in which millions of humans were enslaved in a distant future, while in the current time of the plot people were hunted by a killing machine called the Shrike.<br />Dark futures could be seen as a hallmark of Dan Simmons work. Literary allusion is another theme. In Hyperion there are allusions to the work of the romantic poet Keats. Dan Simmons book Ilium is heavily based on Homer's Iliad, the story of the Trojan war. The Iliad is itself a dark tale. Troy is destroyed, many of its men killed, its women raped and sold into slavery. The war did not turn out well in the end for many of the Greeks. Agamemnon, the Greek king who defeats Troy, returns home, fated to be murdered by his wife, Clymenestra (although this is not part of Homer's tale).<br />Ilium is beautifully written and Simmons' story is compelling. In Ilium the Greek Gods watch (and sometimes meddle) as the Trojan war unfolds. The Gods have resurrected various classic scholars from the twentieth and early twenty-first century whose job it is to record the Trojan war. The war as it plays out on the plains of Troy largely follows the story Homer related, but the scholars are forbidden to tell anyone, even the Gods, of Homers account before the events have come to pass. The book weaves together three plots lines. The story of the Trojan war is told by an early twenty-first century classics scholar named Hockenberry. In Ilium much of humanity has been wiped out by the &quot;Rubicon virus&quot; while other humans have evolved through technology into post-humans. &quot;Old-style&quot; humans remain on earth and one plot line in Ilium relates to them. The final plot line involves Moravecs (biomechanical sentient beings, named after Hans Moravec). The Moravecs have been &quot;seeded&quot; throughout the Jupiter system and the asteroid belt. A group of Moravecs has been sent on a mission to Mars by their government, which is concerned that massive quantum disturbances on Mars imperil the solar system.<br />Ilium is set in the same &quot;universe&quot; as Simmons short story The Ninth of Av which was published in his story collection Worlds Enough and Time. One of the characters in this story, a woman named Savi, plays an important part in Ilium.<br />Ilium is a book for the patient reader. The constant switching back and forth between the three story lines can take concentration and at times I found that I had to flip back to a previous section to find a detail I had forgotten. The structure and reasons behind the story line are revealed slowly as well. The Greek Gods reside on Olympus Mons, on Mars. At first I thought that Troy and the Greeks were somehow also on Mars. It was not until the end of the book that I understood the spatial and temporal relationship between the Gods and the Trojan war. Ironically, some of the later arriving characters in the story were confused as well (&quot;How did we end up on Earth?&quot;).<br />In reading Simmons' work I have sometimes wondered if he knew in advance how the story would unfold. In reading the Hyperion books I wondered if Simmons knew, even in broad outline, how this long complex story would evolve when he wrote the first book.<br />Ilium is the first book of a two part story, which is supposed to be finished in Olympos, so the complete story cannot be judged at this point. As with most Dan Simmons books the story is compelling, but there have been cases were the plot of a compelling Dan Simmons story fell apart at the end (for example, his book Summer of Night). If Olympos is as good as Ilium and Simmons manages to pull all the plot lines into a profound whole these books will be some of Simmons best work.mpelling, but there have been cases were the plot of a compelling Dan Simmons story fell apart at the end (for example, his book Summer of Night).

In the past most natural language processing (NLP)<br />applications where mainly in the research realm.  The rapid<br />increase in computer processing power and disk storage capacity<br />have moved NLP from research into the area of applied science.<br />This gives NLP the feel of a new and vibrant area.  Progress is<br />being made rapidly, but the research literature can be difficult<br />for someone who has no experience with NLP.  Simply learning the<br />terminology can be time consuming.<br />This book by Jackson and Moulinier provides an excellent overview<br />of several sub-areas of NLP applied to natural language text.<br />Both Jackson and Moulinier have been involved in implementing<br />NLP applications in a commercial context, so there is a<br />some concentration on applying NLP in real applications, rather<br />than artificial contexts like the Message Understand Conference<br />data set.<br />I purchased this book for its coverage of Information Extraction.<br />Along with this book I read a number of papers from the research<br />literature.  One paper I found particularly interesting was<br />a paper on the FASTUS NLP system developed by researchers at<br />SRI.  I was very happy to see that FASTUS and finite automata<br />approaches were covered in more detail in this book.<br />For my purposes I would have liked a book that moved from<br />an overview of various NLP applications to more implementation<br />detail.  For example, while I think that I understand<br />push down automata from working on parsers for compilers,<br />I don't fully understand them in the NLP context.  This book<br />did not go into enough detail to make this clear.<br />I cannot really offer this lack of detail as a criticism<br />since I don't believe that it was the authors intention to<br />provide this level of detail.  Their objective is to provide<br />a detailed overview and I think that they succeeded in doing<br />this.  A book that provided this overview with<br />details on implementation would be much longer, perhaps the<br />size of Manning and Schutze's excellent book &quot;Foundations of<br />Natural Language Processing&quot; (Manning and Schutze provide<br />a great deal of detail, but they do not cover information<br />extraction).k that provided this overview with<BR>details on implementation would be much longer, perhaps the<BR>size of Manning and Schutze's excellent book &quot;Foundations of<BR>Natural Language Processing&quot; (Manning and Schutze provide<BR>a great deal of detail, but they do not cover information <BR>extraction).	2003-09-08

Perhaps if you are right out of<br />college this book might have a few good tips, but those are buried<br />in cliched prose and observations of the obvious.  Here is just<br />one example:<br />  \\"One of the all-time classics, the crusty and cranky coder is a<br />  timeless symbol found in trade magazine advertisements<br />  everywhere.  Far from fiction, these are very real people.<br />  With a diminished patience for others sculpted from many<br />  years of corporate ineptitude, these folks tend to be<br />  irritable, frustrated, and they just basically want to be<br />  left alone.  Or else.  They may or may not appear to have<br />  any teeth, but it's wise not to antagonize them.  This<br />  is particularly good advice for the young.  They may seem<br />  powerless to affect your life, but tick them off and you're<br />  liable to find out exactly how they've managed to survive<br />  in the business world for so long.\\"<br />  Along with the \\"crusty coder\\" we find \\"suits\\" (those would<br />be managers and marketing types) and, of course, our heroic<br />software engineers, who are just artists that want to be left<br />alone to develop beautiful, high quality software.  Instead<br />they find themselves bogged down in deathmarch schedules on<br />software projects with constantly expanding feature lists.<br />  While there is some truth in this picture of the life of the<br />software engineer, it is so obscured by cliche and stereotypes<br />that it is of little value.  An underlying theme of the book<br />is that programmers are oblivious \\"propeller heads\\".  With<br />their heads in the clouds of object hierarchy, programmers<br />rely on the author to point out that those who pay for<br />software development expect a return on their investment.<br />  The author never mentions a core fact in the life of most<br />software engineers: they don't do development.  Although most<br />of the literature concentrates on designing and implementing<br />new software, in most cases programmers fix bugs in and extend<br />existing code.  The really ugly truth is that many programmers<br />spend most of their time fixing huge masses of undocumented,<br />poorly designed code that was written by engineers who have<br />long since departed the company.<br />  The book seems to be heavily slanted toward large<br />corporate IT software development.  It is copyrighted in 2002.<br />It does not mention that the programmers in large corporate<br />IT departments, where you might really find examples of the<br />empty \\"suits\\" described in this book, are disappearing,<br />as programming jobs are exported to India, Russian and China.<br />  When it comes to Silicon Valley, the book is much less accurate.<br />The management of companies like H-P may be populated<br />by professional managers, but it is increasingly rare to find<br />managers who do not understand the technology or the<br />software development process.  Even IBM is producing<br />interesting and innovative software these days.  Good managers<br />are like good anything else: they are rare.  But the portrait<br />of idiot managers in this book is right out of a Dilbert<br />cartoon.  Yeah, they exist, but in the current savage technology<br />environment they are an endangered species.<br /><br />  The founders of start-up companies don't have a simplistic<br />30,000 foot view of technology.  They know the technology,<br />even if they are not implementing it.  In most cases the<br />they are very bright people.<br />  This book has a section on the importance of quality assurance<br />(QA) departments and the author denounces software that is<br />shipped without testing (who can argue with that).  But what<br />he totally misses is that even when they exist, QA departments<br />are ineffective.  QA should be part of the development process,<br />not some separatedepartment populated by lower status engineers.<br />The QA people should work closely with the developers, not<br />as some separate department, sending the message that quality<br />and testing is not something that developers worry about.<br />  The author is, apparently, a software consultant.

In fact,<br />it was on the basis of these reviews that I picked up this book<br />in paperback.  Unfortunately, even by the standards of Tom<br />Clancy, this book is a howler.<br />In a work of fiction we expect that the author invents a plot,<br />characters and setting.  Unless the fictional work is based<br />entirely in a fictional world, I expect that the author will<br />have done at least some basic research, building the plot<br />from easily known fact.  This is certainly not Dan Brown's<br />style.<br />In the opening of the book we find that the NSA is willing<br />to double the industry salary offers of the best and the<br />brightest to assure that they have access to the best talent.<br />This does not resembly any government job I've ever heard of.<br />NSA jobs, like other government jobs, follow government pay<br />scale and are certainly not known for their largess.  The<br />mistakes continue in an opening scene in a government security<br />facility protected by a dome able to withstand a \\"2 megaton\\"<br />nuclear blast.  Then we have near magical computing technology<br />which, darn, is put in danger by a single software developer.<br />There are also egregious slams against the Electronic Frountiers<br />Foundation (EFF) and anyone else who wants to put barriers in the<br />ways of the NSA.<br />In the acknowledgements Brown claims to have corresponded with<br />two cryptographers at the NSA via anonymous remailers.  If this<br />is true, what ever wisdom they attempted to impart seems to have<br />been lost on Brown.  He does not seem to have read basic books<br />like The Puzzle Palace or Applied Cryptography.<br />On top of this shaky plot foundation are predictable characters<br />who are little more than cardboard cutouts.  Even Tom Clancy's<br />worst is better than this.  So my recommendation is leave this<br />insult to dead threes ...	2003-08-04

This is his first non-science fiction novel<br />I've read and it appears to have been a poor choice.<br />Dead Air follows the life of Ken Nott, who is a \\"DJ Shock Jock\\"<br />on commercial British radio.  While there are some wonderful<br />slams at the appointment of George W. Bush by the Supreme Court,<br />the book degenerates into long passages of political diatribe and<br />boring social observation.  Perhaps Banks is trying to show us<br />how trite and silly some of the classic British leftist view<br />are.<br />The true master of commentary on hard core leftist philosophy<br />is Ken MacLeod (The Star Fraction, Sky Road and others),<br />who manages to show the problems that fanatics<br />have without boring the reader to death.  This is not Iain<br />Banks forte.<br />The \\"DJ\\" Ken Nott is a terminal womanizer, although it is<br />difficult to tell what women see in him.  The constant affairs<br />get tedious.  Banks tries to inject some suspense into the story<br />by introducing some nefarious characters who are after Ken Nott<br />for various reasons, but ultimately this fails to carry the<br />story.<br />The final attempt at suspense is a result of drunken stupidity<br />on the part of Ken Nott.  Mr. Nott's character might actually<br />agree that anyone who acts so stupidly deserves extinction.<br />Nor would Mr. Nott really object to this too much, he just<br />does not desire a painful demise.<br />About half way through the book it become clear<br />that the story was in real trouble.  At this point I started<br />skipping through the book to the equally boring ending.<br />If you're a Iain Banks fan (or even it you're not) I can only<br />recommend that you skip this book.  Or, if you must read it,<br />get it from the library and spend your money on Bank's many<br />other fine books.	2003-06-26

The<br />second part is supposed to give you a foundation for \\"scientific\\"<br />investing. The book fails miserably in both sections. There is<br />only a single decent chapter, \\"How to Avoid Spurious<br />Correlations\\" in the second half of the book.<br />The opening chapter is titled \\"The Meme\\" and is an unreadable<br />rehash of the history of the market (and the world) from<br />1997 to 2002. I find it hard to understand why this chapter<br />was included. Things get a little better after this, but not<br />much. The authors attack \\"value investing\\" in a shallow fashion<br />without addressing any of the newer work that has followed<br />Graham and Dodd. They also attack technical analysis, which<br />is certainly an easy target. They have a whole chapter that<br />attacks an editor of Barron's, who apparently guilty of the<br />thought crime of holding consistently negative views about the<br />market.<br />Except for the single chapter on statistics, the second half<br />is no better than the first. The authors provide no help for an investor<br />who seeks to build a portolio and understand its risks. There<br />is a chapter that equates the laws of physics with the market,<br />but is nothing more than analogy.<br />There is a vast literature on investing. Save your money and<br />buy another book.	2003-06-02

Not wanting to install<br />Apache, I installed Resin as my HTTP server and AXIS for<br />my SOAP protocol support.  I've also installed Apache's<br />SOAP GUI.<br />I got everything running to the point where I could run<br />sevlets.  But attempting to run the SOAP remote procedure<br />call examples given in the book has been very frustrating.<br />In what directory should I install my servlet that provides<br />the  functions that are called via SOAP/RPC?  How can I<br />diagnose failures when things go wrong?  This book is not<br />much help.<br />Since no single software base exists to support HTTP, a Java<br />server and SOAP the author faces a difficult problem.  This<br />problem could have been addressed by picking a software base<br />and then providing examples in terms of this base.  I<br />recommend Resin (because it is easy to install and is light<br />weight), Axis (because it is standard) and the Apache SOAP<br />GUI (which the author does cover).  The author also covers<br />a product called GLUE.  As an Axis/Apache SOAP user I skipped<br />all the GLUE examples, so I think that the book would be better<br />without them (of course a GLUE user probably feels that way<br />about Apache).<br />While this book provides a decent introduction on what SOAP is<br />and how it functions under Java, it is very frustrating that<br />simple examples are so difficult to run.  The book would have<br />been much better if the author had stuck to a single platform<br />and then provided the necessary detail.  This would frustrate<br />users who are not using the platform chosen in the book, but<br />as it is, the book is little help in the nuts and bolts of<br />Java/SOAP execution.	2003-05-21

In general I don't read a lot of detective or mystery fiction. An exception has been David Lindsey. I own most of his books, even some of the more obscure works, published early in his career. I have been drawn to Lindsey's books by his writing style and the moral ambiguity of his plots. Sometimes decent people do ugly things in Lindsey's stories. As in life, in Lindsey's plots there have been no simple answers.<br />The Rules of Silence is the last David Lindsey book I'm planning to buy. The only reason that I was able to finish this howler is that I could not believe that the plot was really as simplistic as it turned out to be. I kept thinking that Lindsay would twist the plot around in the end and show the reader that everything that they thought was true was not. Instead The Rules of Silence was a waste of time and money. This is the sort of book that I would expect from Clive Cussler, not the author of Mercy.<br />In contrast to some of Lindsay's previous work, the characters in The Rules of Silence are cliches, without any depth. The story is so predictable and trite that until I reached the last page I could not believe that Lindsay would actually write something like this. If Lindsay had a long history of writing empty \\"boy fiction\\", then I would not expect anything else. Sadly Lindsay has been capable of better work. Given the poor quality of this book and the fact that there are so many good books, I'll think twice before spending time on another David Lindsay work.	2003-05-18

Like all of Holdstock's work, Celtika weaves<br />myth and reality together.  In Holdstock's book characters from<br />myth and demigods walk among men and women.  Holdstock's earlier<br />works are full of obcession, love and passion as the world of<br />humans intersects with the world of myth (or Mythagos).  This<br />gives his earlier work a somewhat dark quality.  Although Celtika<br />opens in the snow and at a haunted lake, this work seems lighter<br />somehow.<br />  Holdstock is an excellent english stylist and has an encylopedic<br />knowledge of early history and myth.  Celtika is a strange<br />intersection a time which appears to be between Alexander's<br />conquests and the rise of the Roman Empire, with mythical greek<br />history.<br />  Although I suppose Celtika work would be classified as<br />fantasy, Holdstock does not write classic fantasy.  His<br />stories have a real character to them.  The main character,<br />Merlin, does not wash much, as few people did in the west<br />before modern times.  Celtika recounts a story from earlier<br />in Merlins very long life where he is seduced by a woman.<br />She come to him in a sheer dress, smelling of flowers.<br />As she undresses him she discovers that he is filthy.  She<br />first cleans him before they make love.<br />  Holdstock definitely writes for a well read audience.<br />The story of Media is interwoven into Celtika and if you<br />have not read or seen the Greek play Media, it might be<br />worth reading to understand some of the background in this<br />story.  In particular, why Media is so bitter.<br />  In summary, this is an excellent book...	2003-05-10

I try to order all the books<br />that have something unique to say about compiler design and<br />implementation.  This is one of the best books I have seen on<br />advanced compiler design.  I have owned it since it was first<br />published.  Going back and rereading it I am reminded of what<br />and excellent book it is, which is what motivated this review.<br />Advanced compiler design deals with various forms of optimization,<br />including local, global and loop optimization.  This is a complex<br />topic with thirty years of research behind it (it is interesting<br />to note that the late Gary Kildall, of CP/M fame, did some early<br />work on optiimization in the early 1970s).  No single book can<br />provide complete coverage of all optimization issues.  However,<br />this book, along with Allen and Kennedy's equally excellent<br />&quot;Optimizing Compilers for Modern Architectures&quot; covers almost<br />everything you need to know.<br />One of the problems with the academic literature on compiler<br />optimization is that it can be unnecessarily obscure.  Muchnick<br />writes clearly, with the implementer in mind.  He provides a<br />wide range of techniques, allowing the implementer to choose<br />the correct one for a given compiler.  This approach is both<br />useful and necessary: there is no single method for building<br />a compiler, given the range of languages and design objectives.<br />Muchnick covers everything you need to know about local and<br />global scalar optimization, including scalar optimization in<br />loops and optimization for modern processor architecture.<br />The only thing missing is an indepth coverage of loop dependence<br />and optimization techniques, which is provided by Allen and<br />Kennedy.<br />If you are working on the design, implementation or extension of<br />a modern compiler, this book should be part of your library.	2003-04-14

This book is a clearly written<br />discussion of the issues involving loop optimization and<br />dependence analysis.  While this book also covers scalar<br />optimization issues, it is naturally complemented by Steven<br />S. Muchnick's excellent book &quot;Advanced Compiler Design and<br />Implementation&quot;.<br />Randy Allen has spent many years implementing a variety of<br />compilers for supercomputers and hardware design languages.<br />While Ken Kennedy has published seminal theoretical work on<br />compiler optimization, he has also been involved in hands on<br />implementation as well.  The experience of these two authors<br />results in a book which covers the huge body of knowledge in<br />compiler optimization and provides this knowledge in a<br />practical form that can be used by software engineers working<br />on compiler design.<br />For anyone working on modern compilers that require sophisticated<br />optimization features, this is an important reference work.<br />As with Muchnick's book, I have owned this since it was first<br />published.  Rereading it reminds me of what a gem this work is.	2003-04-14

I did not buy it originally<br />because I was put off by the reviews that stated that Taleb was<br />an out-of-control egotist and name dropper.  However, I read<br />a few interviews with Taleb and he hardly seemed to fit this<br />profile.  So I ordered the book.  It is one of the best books<br />I have read this year (and I read a lot).<br />  The book is heavily infused with Taleb's work and obcession:<br />the market.  But it also covers his view of life and one of the<br />best discussions of how to think about statistics I've ever<br />read (and I collect statistics books).<br />  Taleb is a very accomplished man.  He has been a successful<br />options trader, he wrote a respected book on options and he<br />has a successful hedge fund.  You cannot do these things without<br />a healthy ego and Taleb's is indeed healthy.  He escapes being<br />an egotist because he realizes that he has the same flaws that<br />he skewers others for having.  The only difference between these<br />people and Taleb (he writes) is that he understands that he<br />has these flaws.<br />  Taleb has an unusual and fascinating world view.  He explains<br />the many sides of this view and reading this book has given me<br />things to think about for weeks after I finished.  I easily<br />believed Taleb's view that humans have a hard time thinking<br />about random events.  One of our greatest strengths is the<br />recognition of patterns.  But we also see patterns where they<br />do not exist.  In short, we are easily fooled by randomness.	2003-03-28

The book<br />seems to be largely based on Feder's 1988 book &quot;Fractals&quot;.  The<br />dated nature of this book means that it is missing later work<br />on long memory processes, which Peters estimates using the Hurst<br />exponent.<br />As one reviewer already noted, don't assume that this book will<br />provide much in the way of useful equations.  For anyone who wants<br />more than an overview, this book is a disappointment.  Peters does<br />a poor job of explaining the equations and I did not find enough<br />detail to implement the algorithms discussed (I turned to Feder's<br />book and various journal articles).  The book does come with a<br />&quot;floppy&quot; disk containing the Visual Basic algorithms.  This is<br />a poor choice, since C is pretty much the lingua franca for<br />algorithms.<br />The various chaos and fractal techniques are applied to a handful<br />of financial data sets, but this is far from even a solid<br />suggestion that these techniques might be useful to anyone<br />developing real market models.<br />Some of the conclusions that Peters draws (cycles in financial<br />data) do not seem to be supported the evidence he presents.<br />In summary, if you are looking for something beyond an overview,<br />save your money.  Feder (&quot;Fractals&quot;) has a better description of<br />RS calculation.  &quot;A Non-Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot; by Lo<br />and MacKinlay has a chapeter on the application of the RS<br />statistic and long-memory processes which is much better than<br />Peters.  For those who need to simulate fractal brownian motion<br />(data sets with a particular Hurst exponent) &quot;The Science of<br />Fractal Images&quot; by Barnsley et all is a good reference.	2003-02-10

You do not need an advanced background<br />in mathematics as you do for some books on chaos and fractals,<br />but the authors do not shy away from equations.  However, the<br />ideas are clearly presented.  I have used this book as a<br />reference for developing software for fractal brownian motion<br />and Hurst exponent estimation.<br />&quot;Chaos and Fractals&quot; covers a great deal of material.  On a few<br />occasions I found that the algorithms or explaination were<br />difficult to follow.  In some cases, like the generation of<br />Gaussian random numbers, I found better, simpler algorithms.<br />When this book was written, fractals and chaos were fairly new.<br />It is difficult to avoid comparing this book to an even thicker<br />book, &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot; by Stephen Wolfram.  Although<br />cellular automata, the core topic of &quot;A New Kind of Science&quot;<br />are not exactly new, Wolfram claims new and profound<br />perspectives.  Many, including this reviewer, feel that Wolfram's<br />claims are overblown and egotistical (he has a bad habbit of<br />claiming credit for innovation, even as he cites other work).<br />The authors of &quot;Chaos and Fractals&quot; do not make exalted<br />claims for this work.  Yet without any fanfare, this book<br />really does deliver profound ideas.  This is simply a<br />fantastic book.

This is certainly reflected<br />in this book.<br />This book covers a number of areas that are not covered outside<br />of journal articles.  For example, there are chapters on<br />interpolating wavelets (e.g., wavelets built via splines or<br />polynomials).  The coverage of interpolation and splines to<br />construct wavelet is good, but the authors quickly gloss over<br />the other critical half of the problem: how to construct a<br />scaling function for a given interpolating wavelet.  I have<br />read over this material several times and I have not found the<br />answer.  I have come to doubt that the answer is there, at<br />least in a complete form.<br />This characterizes much of the book.  The authors cover<br />important material, but if you are not already deeply<br />familiar wavelet mathematics, it may be difficult or<br />impossible to implement an algorith from the coverage<br />provided in this book.  Many practical issues are missing.<br />For example, many wavelets calculated on a finite data set<br />like an image can have edge effects.  There is little<br />in this book on minimizing edge effects.<br />If you are already familiar with wavelet algorithms and their<br />implementation, this book may be a great reference for wavelet<br />applications in computer graphics.  But it is by no means<br />an introduction for the novice.	2001-12-16

Although books like<br />Strang and Nguyen's &quot;Wavelets and Filter Banks&quot; are<br />well written math books, their emphasis is on mathematics,<br />not application.  For example, not until Chapter 8, half<br />way through the book, do Strang and Nguyen discuss the<br />mathematics for dealing with a finite, rather than an<br />infinite data set.<br />&quot;Ripples in Mathematics&quot; is the seventh book on wavelets that<br />I've worked with.  So far it is the best.  The concentration<br />is on applying wavelet techniques.  The book approaches<br />wavelets through a relatively new technique developed<br />by Wim Sweldens and others called &quot;the Lifting Scheme&quot;.  The<br />lifting scheme provides a structure for wavelets that is<br />easier to understand.  Lifting scheme wavelets also have the<br />elegant feature that the transform and the inverse transform<br />are mirrors of each other.<br />The authors of &quot;Ripples in Mathematics&quot; keep the mathematics<br />level at a relatively introductory level (e.g., relative<br />to some of the other wavelet books).<br />&quot;Ripples in Mathematics&quot; provides the first explaination of<br />wavelet packets that I have understood.  Even better they<br />discuss the actual implementation of the wavelet packet<br />algorithm.  They also provide a chapter that covers wavelets<br />applied to finite data sets in a clear non-theoretical fashion<br />(I found this much more approachable than Strang and Nguyen).<br />The perfect wavelet book for me has not yet been written,<br />so I have given this book only four stars.  I think of<br />my perfect book on wavelets as &quot;Wavelets for Dumb Engineers&quot;.<br />This book has been written for Fourier analysis and classical<br />signal processing (see Richard Lyons' outstanding book<br />&quot;Understanding Digital Signal Processing&quot;).<br />There is a difference in point of view between mathematicans<br />and most software and hardware engineers.  Our concern is<br />how the technique can be applied.  &quot;Ripples in Mathematics&quot;<br />provides the necessary material to implement the algorithms,<br />but you will have to put in some work reading this book and<br />writing the software (or software models for a hardware<br />implementation).  There are no application hints of the kind<br />that Lyons provides for applying the Fourier transform.  Unlike<br />Lyons the authors are mathematicians, not practicing digital<br />signal processing engineers.ce in point of view between mathematicans<BR>and most software and hardware engineers.

The author spends five very mathematically<br />laden chapters discussing dynamical systems.  There is nothing<br />solid on applying the mathematics of dynamical systems to<br />financial time series other than the observation that they<br />sure seem chaotic.  At the very end the author weakly suggests<br />that dynamical systems theory might be applied to market<br />information, but he provides no examples.<br />People who develop successful market models usually don't<br />publish much on them, since there is a lot to be gained<br />by trading them.  So one cannot catagorically state what has<br />and has not been done.  However, I know of no case where<br />dynamical systems mathematics has been used to successfully<br />provide predictive models (e.g., models you can trade and<br />make money on) of financial markets.  This book certainly does<br />not live up to the promise of its title.<br />There are a number of good book on time series analysis and<br />modeling.  For example, see &quot;Wavelet Methods for Time Series Analysis&quot; by Donald B. Percival, Andrew T. Walden.  This book<br />does not deal with financial time series directly, but it does<br />deal with &quot;non-stationary&quot; time series.	2001-09-08
US	53096389	R1DUEESYMCK8DU	0521599148	602714024	Image Processing and Data Analysis: The Multiscale Approach	Books	2	4	6	N	N	This is not a five star book	I purchased this book because I am interested in applying wavelet to financial time series.  The authors have written a paper in using wavelets and noise analysis to filter these time series, so I thought that this book had promise.  And in fact chapter 2 deals with noise modeling and noise filtering.<br />The only problem is that I found this material impossible to follow.  Despite the claims that the book is aimed at applications, there are few real examples.  In the case of noise modeling and noise filtering there are none.  It was impossible for me to tell whether the techniques they seem to suggest work or how they can be applied.<br />I've become fairly expert on Haar wavelets.  Even so I can read their explaination of the Haar wavelet transform only with difficulty.<br />The authors give the impression that they are academics writing for academics (at the post graduate level).  The book provides equations as quick short hand for ideas and the reader is expected to fill in the blanks.  Perhaps a post graduate background in math is needed.  However I would not say that the publishers description properly reflects the contents of this book: &quot;[the book] develops the reader's undersanding of each technique and then shows with practical examples  how they can be applied to improve the skills of [...]  electrical engineers.&quot;  Real world applications are mentioned, but never fully explained.<br />All in all I found this book an expensive disappointment.	2001-06-23
