I agree with both the negative and positive reviews. Damasio has written what could have been a terrific book; yet he missed the mark by a mile. He writes like a sociologist instead of neuroscientist: he repeats his thesis twenty different ways. It seems he didn't have enough information to make a real book, so he restates the same points, and it gets tiring.<br />The subject is facinating. The brain anatomy is facinating. The book, however, is not. My recommendation is only lukewarm--and I'm sure there are other books out there that tell the same story in more readable writing.	2002-10-21

I bought it because the copywrite page had me cracking up in the bookstore, and when I read the first few pages out loud to my teenagers, we were laughing together (mostly because they thought hearing mom edit as she read was hilarious). <BR> <BR>Eggers is right when he tells you that much of the book can be skipped. It does get a little tedious in the middle, but it's still worth reading. And it's good to know we have &quot;permission&quot; to skim through the long boring parts. The MTV interview, in particular, starts becoming repetitive and deserves to be skimmed. Interestingly though, after I was done with the book I went back and re-read the parts I had skimmed. They were still long and boring, but added to the story. <br />Eggers set himself up with the title -- we expect SO much when we're told we're reading a work of genius. When I finished the book, however, I realized that Eggers ego works for him. While I may disagree about the level of genius, I realize he could not have &quot;made it through&quot; his life without humor, mania, and ego. <BR>If nothing else, the book reminds me that we &quot;all have a story&quot; and that it's how we live that story that matters.<br />The book bordered on 3 3/4 stars--it's readable, it's interesting, but it runs long. I'd definitely recommend it as an &quot;interesting&quot; book. When friends ask about it, I tell them only to read it if they're up for the emotional rollercoaster of a twenty-something young man with too much responsibility. And if they're okay with knowing ahead of time that they'll likely be skipping entire sections of the book.	2002-01-07

My four-year-old daughter is learning them. Max is the not-so-bad monster in every little one; the one who is brave and wild and tender and imaginative all at once. He is the King of all wild things--and they love him, but not quite as much as his mother (who couldn't bring herself to REALLY send him to bed without anything to eat at all). <br />Enough with the PC rants about this book. Another reviewer said he was &quot;snotty&quot; and rude. Give me a break-what child isn't just a tiny bit too lippy on some days. It's life. The thing about the book is that while Max may be a little &quot;snotty,&quot; he's imaginative, alive, and still knows that even after being punished, his mother loves him 'best of all.' <br />The illustrations are beautiful. The story is terrific. And I'm glad to say it was the perfect snuggle-at-bedtime book for every one of my children. <br />And I have the words retained in memory forever. I'll someday chant them to my grandchildren.	2001-11-07

But I wonder if those who gave it a bad review noticed that the little boy wasn't selfish--he became selfish as he grew into an adult. And yes, the tree did give and give until she was not even a tree anymore but just an old stump.<br />Isn't there a lesson there that some are missing?? The lesson isn't that as a female figure, she HAD to give and give to be happy and to be loved; rather that giving to extreme, even for love, may leave you alone and sad (the tree was sad for most of time). <br />In the end, the boy comes back and realizes what he's done to his beloved tree. I think he realizes his love destroyed her--and the tree does too (she says she has nothing left to give). <br />Maybe I'm just too much of a pollyanna--but I don't believe this is an &quot;awful&quot; children's book. I read it to my children, and they took from the story the same thing I took from it. My daughters didn't find the story to mean they HAD to stay in bad relationships, as another reviewer said the story implied. They took from it that relationships in which the giving and receiving aren't equal lead to heartache. <br />It's a good lesson. Thanks Shel.	2001-11-07

I'm glad it was there though---<br />First, what I thought I was picking up was sort of an extended version of Dave Barry's column, but in a novel sort-of-compilation. It's hard to explain. But what I got was not at all what I exected. This was a REAL LIVE NOVEL (okay, so it wasn't ALIVE, but it WAS a real novel). This novel had a real story--not in the rambling-from-one-topic-to-the-other kind of way the column runs. <br />You can pick up the premise of the story from the editorial reviews--but know that if you buy this book and already enjoy Dave's writing, you won't regret your purchase. It's a new genre--comedy/mystery. And it works, in a keystone cops sort of way.<br />The characters aren't endearing, but the story is. A terrific first novel (although not his first 'work of fiction.' As Berry pointed out when someone called it his first fiction, that stuff in his column, well &quot;some of that's made up&quot; too).	2001-11-06

At some point in my life, much of what Sagan wrote became &quot;common knowledge&quot; and much less interesting to read, because I stopped learning from him.<br />Then I realized: he had done his job. Sagan excited me, thrilled me, MADE me go out and learn more because I couldn't stand not knowing.<br />Carl Sagan was a master at distilling science to the masses; he made physics, biology, cosmology, math...he made it all so thrilling that the masses barely knew they were learning. <br />If you're not already a Sagan fan, try starting with his fiction (Contact--the book is a thousand times better than the movie), and then moving on to his nonfiction. You'll discover from Sagan why we are where and who we are.<br />Read it. Learn it. Then outgrow it. You'll be honoring Sagan, and you'll be honoring your own humanity.	2001-11-06

Thirteen thousand years of human history, written by a biologist/molecular physiologist rather than a historian. It's an amazingly dense piece of work; it's intelligent and interesting to read yet not so easy to &quot;get into.&quot; I love these types of books-yet this one took me over a month to finish. <br />Jared Diamond seeks to explain why Eurasians conquered most of the world-why the winners won instead of the other way around. His thesis is spelled out pretty completely in the title: the winners won not because of genetics as much as opportunity: they won because they had seeds (agriculture), resistance to germs, guns, and steel. Each of these intercepted with the others-for example, immunity to germs, such as smallpox, was obtained by working with domestic and farm animals; animals that weren't around the inhabitants of the New World. <br />Diamond also tackles race head-on (yes, in a politically correct sort of way). He points out that genetics definitely helps confer an advantage to some groups (West African's resistance to malaria, for example), and that these advantages 'overuled' the military advantage of the Europeans in some cases. Aside from these examples, Diamond is leery to talk about neuro-biodiversity. I'm not, by any stretch of the imagination, claiming any race holds genetic *superiority* over another, but the *differences* in ethnic diversity are important to consider. Biologists, in particular, should be able to do this without fear of being labeled a racist, despite the abominable history of eugenics. <br />In the end, we have to remember that Diamond is not a historian. What he offers us here is a remarkable look at where the human race has been, and a plausible theory as to our routes through history. He did miss the boat on the FATES of society though--the future has yet tobe written. Although the book was difficult to wade through, it was worth reading, and deserving of its Pulitzer Prize.	2001-11-06

I have such mixed reactions to this book; it's difficult to verbalize them. <BR>Isaac's Storm is a powerful human story, one that leaves an imprint of death and sadness on the reader long after finishing the book. We can imagine what it must have been like for Isaac, who must have felt partially responsible for the loss of so many lives (including his wife and daughter).  I could also vividly imagine what it must have felt like to watch the walls of the house breath with pounding water, and the desperate attempts to save family from the onslaught of wind, water, and debris. <br />On the other hand, I was bothered by what seemed a bit of fictionalization. I was left to wonder whether Isaac and his brother, Joseph, were truly rivals or if the author expanded on that aspect of their relationship in order to make the book more interesting. Joseph seemed to take a back seat to his brother's importance, although it was Joseph who more accurately sensed the impending danger. It was Joseph who loved his brother enough to stay with him throughout the storm and even rescue his children.<br />I also had a difficult time getting excited about the first half of the book. This may be due to circumstance: I read the first half in 15-30 minute spurts on lunch breaks. Or it may be because of the context changes from chapter to chapter s in the first half (from Galveston to the history of the Weather Bureau). The last half of the book, read in one sitting, was much more interesting-but it also focused on a single timeline, leading us from the heart of the storm and the devastation that followed, into the final years of both Joseph and Isaac.<br />I'd recommend this book, but not as your first introduction to \\"historical\\" fictionalized non-fiction (if that made any sense at all).	2001-11-06

I read this book a decade ago, and recently re-read it. It's still as good; and is enhanced by Asimov's forward. The book touches on the relationship between who we are physically, and what we think. There are chapters explaining the intricate link between our senses (visual perception and sound, for example--how sound can sometime produce 'colors').<br />The Three-Pound Universe discusses madness, heaven and hell, god, the neurobiology of madness, altered states of consciousness....it touches on a lot, without going too in depth. It was a great introduction, one that inspired me to read more on the subject. If this book had been published in the 1980's, and I had stumbled on it in high school, it could have changed my life.	2001-10-21

I do that often in airport bookstores and have almost always regretted my choice. This was no exception. <br />The title promised me an ancient story--one that I imagined would lead me back to the mother-roots in Africa through the chain of mitochondrial DNA. It did--sort of. But it didn't live up to it's promise. The book is perfect for my teenage son, and it'd be perfect for anyone who is looking for an introduction to mt-DNA. It's not a bad book, it just was lacking the 'meat' I was hoping for.<br />I could have handled Sykes self-inflated writing style (his ego's so big it dominates!) if his book had offered some insight. Rather, after a very long, round-about journey, he finally gets to fictionalizing our roots. Instead of telling me<BR>the story of molecular evolution and letting the wonder of science fill in the blanks, he covers basic information between a million sidetracks--the result: his seven daughters were terminally boring.<br />I've read the good reviews here--and am left to think that I may have been expecting too much. Perhaps if this were my introduction to the subject, I could have enjoyed it. I think Carl Sagan could have done this brilliantly, and it almost seems sad that he didn't take it on before Sykes and that we'll never hear his voice on it.<BR> <BR>My recommedation would be to skip this book if you're already pretty familiar with mitochondrial DNA and the mechanisms of inheritance, but pick it up if you want a good introduction told as a story rather than as dense text.	2001-10-19

I want to be able to glean so much knowlege from the book that I walk away with a head two times bigger than it was when I started! When I realized it was written (in part) and contributed to by faculty at the University of Washington (where I earned my BS), I assumed we were assigned this over-priced book simply because they wrote it. As a poor student, it really bothered me...until I read it.<br />But my rant stops there; the rest of the review is good. I used this book the first year it was published in a class; the text was clear and had a nice mix of review material that kept you up to date. The organization was good, beginning with a brief section on Mendelian genetics, moving to gene regulation, and ending with a bang-up chapter on population genetics and molecular evolution. <br />I'm hanging on to the book rather than packing it away or selling it back, because I  know I still have more to learn. Highly recommended.	2001-10-19

I'm convinced now that I'll just have to buy every single one of Gonicks's guides. <br />Whenever possible, I have avoided physics classes--they scare me--which is difficult to do. But knowing this, I became obsessed with facing my fear and picked up this book (and a few others). I wasn't disappointed. Although it wasn't as easy to follow his other two books (perhaps because I'm more familiar with the subject of the other two books), it made physics more interesting, and less scary. I was able to reread sections and then cross reference them with a 'real' physics text until I got the point. <br />I'm still no physicist, and I never will be. But I've got a basic grasp now that I didn't have before, and can understand the simple physics of the world around me. However, the biggest kudo I can give to this book is this: I've enrolled in a physics course at the local university--a course I don't *have* to take but want to take. It's something I never would have done without this book easing my fears and taking the mystery out of the subject. <br />Bravo Gonick! Where's the Cartoon Guide to the Quantum Theory?!

Even reading the novel, you feel the exact sameness of the days, how they all blend together in a Soviet workcamp, and how it had to be difficult to keep track of how many days have passed.<br />This book had a profound impact on me. These types of books make me look at myself a little differently. They make me wonder just how I define what's important in my life, and they make me awe at how easy it would be to redefine &quot;important.&quot; For Ivan, what's important is an extra bowl of food, dry gloves, and a little tobacco. But we know, when we read this, that it wasn't what was always important--once upon a time, he had a life.<br />Simply by becoming a prisoner of war, he's become an enemy of the State; and a prisoner of a much larger war (Stalin's war on his people).<br />This book is about more than Stalin and more than a workcamp. It's about much more than a day in the life of a single prisoner. It's about humanity, about questioning who we are and what it would take to make us radically different, and yes, about communism and another world.<br />Read it yourself--and find out.	2001-10-03

Weiner sets the reader down with the ghost of Darwin, on the Galapagos Islands where the Grants have been studying since 1973. He introduces us to 'Darwin's finches,' the same birds Darwin observed and wrote about in &quot;Origin of the Species&quot;. <br />We're introduced to a populationg that is perfect for evolutionary studies--a limited number of species in a closed ecosystem on an isolated island. Darwin couldn't have known what his observations would lead to so many years later, but Weiner shares with us the Grants meticulous study of over 20 generations of finches. Thousands of individual birds were measured, and their progeny tracked. Through this book, we see what they saw--evolution in action.<BR>Weiner weaves facts into a nice story. The book is engaging and reads like a novel, so much so that my 13 year-old daughter is now reading it. <br />The conclusions (and no, this isn't a spoiler) are that evolution by natural selection occurs and that selection can occur quickly (it's not always a slow process). Weiner (and the Grants) also touches on speciation in fish populations, and bacterial and viral evolution.<br />This was required reading in an introductory evolution class in college. I hope, someday, students in high school will be assigned this book. It was excellent, and will probably be wrapped up as Christmas gifts for a few of my friends and family.	2001-10-03

This book is not a biography about Sister Maria Celeste. Which is fine really--truthfully, I'm more interested in Galileo himself; I just take issue with the title. We do learn a bit about his daughter and her fawning adoration for her father, but missing are Galileo's letters to her. Instead, weaved into a biography of her father, are many of the letters she sent.<br />If you're reading this review, I'm assuming you know a bit about Galileo--a man who studied math, matter, gravity, and of course, the heavens. He improved the telescope, and introduced his daughter to the stars in their garden when she was young. Much of his life was devoted to studies of the sun and planets--and to rejecting Aristotle's philosophies (adopted by the Roman Catholic church), in favor of Copernicus's theories. Although his belief's didn't distance him from all theists (he remained a theist to the end), he made some powerful enemies. One was a scientist--a scientist who happened to be a member of the Dominican Order, which staffed the Office of the Inquisition.<br />Sobell characterizes the problems Galileo experienced as differences of opinion based on astronomy rather than differences based on science and religion. Although Galileo was found guilty by the Inquisition, he remained a respected scientist. The Archbishop of Siena still publicly supported him, and with that support, he continued to produce great work. <br />Galileo's relationship with his oldest daughter is also explored, of course. We realize the extent of their love for each other through the surviving letters--all of which came from Maria. As another reviewer mentioned, we also learn of Galileo's financial support to the convent in which he placed his illegitimate daughters. <br />The book is written clearly, and unveils more than just the science in a great scientist's life. We become aware of a man rather than just a name, with emotional ties that run deep. It's a great story--and I'm glad Sobel was the one to tell it.	2001-10-03

US	52822769	R41KS944W3B8K	0380796090	962133592	Watermelon	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Good book despite minor flaws	I've grown accustomed to Keyes' style--to her female heroines who need a major shot of self-esteem, her stream-of-conscience writing, and in particular, her predictability. If it were any other author, it's that last one (predictability) that would spoil the books. I generally have a tough time getting through a book if I know the ending thirty pages into the story. Keyes' books are different though, and I can't explain why. All I can say is that I love them. This one was no exception.<br />Keyes' captures Claire's postpartum/dumped-woman depression with style. We watch her plummet and wonder if she'll pick herself up, and we feel sorry for her new daughter for having such a screwed up mother and maternal family. However, as Claire drags herself out of the dumps, we discover that we actually LIKE this family. They're quirky, but it works (and not to get off the subject, but it helps to explain the characters in Rachel's Holiday, another Keyes' book). <br />Besides the aforementioned predictability, the book is great. I was a little shocked to learn that Claire's two-timing husband was SUCH a horrid person, considering how Claire describes him at the beginning of the book. Although the change in her perception of him is realistic--it reminds me of a woman married to an abusing louse. She only sees the good until she's reached the breaking point, and when reality sets in, it changes not only her view of him but her personality and outlook on life. <br />Watermelon is another light and fun read. This book won't change the world or your view of it, and it certainly won't change your life. It will do exactly what it's meant to do though; it'll let you escape into a fictional world for a day.	2001-09-30

Boy did they miss the mark. This book was so difficult to get through, but to &quot;give it a chance,&quot; I finished it. Okay, so the ending was cute--I wish I would have skipped right to it once the characters had been introduced. The main characters, both male and female, are money hungry scam artists. That's the premise. While they're all deceiving each other, love blossoms. That's the plot. What's left is fluff. I think the book could have been good had the author not tried to 'write like a woman' when his female characters were thinking or talking. I felt like someone was trying too desperately to make me relate to them, and I just couldn't. I couldn't relate to the men either, but that's a given and didn't bother me. The characters were flat and unbelievable. The story dragged on and the entire thing could have been scaled down to a women's magazine short story. And I may have enjoyed a short story version. I'll skip the movie, and recommend skipping the book. The only exception, in both cases, would be long trans-Atlantic airplane flights.	2001-09-05

Rachel's Holiday holds that honor. If I had read this book first, I would have enjoyed it, but probably wouldn't have actively sought out her other titles. That would have been a huge mistake. <br />You know the basic plot, the other reviews have made it clear. My biggest problem with the book was that Katherine and Tara had their characters so spelled out. We knew Thomas, Tara's boyfriend, was awful from the very beginning, and his actions became a transparent way to paint Tara's pre-enlightenment character. Katherine's man-hating, obsessive-compulsive behavior was explained to us in great detail, rather than letting us figure it out by watching her go through life. However, it was interesting to read about them and then reflect on my own life. How true it is that other's can see what we most need to change so much more clearly than we can, and I almost wish I had friends as brutally honest as Fintan (and the whole trio) became.<br />The character development, although somewhat annoying, wasn't a huge problem; it was one that I was willing to overlook because Keyes has earned my trust with her other books. She made up for any flaws in the book with her dialog and the minor characters. Remarkably, one of my favorite characters wasn't even a main one. Benjy, the tag-along overweight friend of ladies-man Lorcan, had me rooting for him from the second he was introduced. <br />Lorcan was another 'interesting' character. Although I found him a little unbelievable, I loved the way he zig-zagged through the main characters' lives--mostly unnoticed and almost virus-like.<br />Keyes has quickly become one of my favorite authors, and I admire her talent and writer's-soul. This book isn't her best, but I still recommend it highly. It's honest, fresh, and has a style that is hard to find. She has me hooked, and I can't wait until my copy of Watermelon arrives!	2001-09-05

She's a talented writer--able to capture the essence of a woman's brain with accuracy and wit. Now, onto my specific review of LSIGM.<br />Lucy's life isn't really in turmoil. She's got problems, but they're the problems of a million other women--chosing the wrong guy time after time, liking the 'bad boy,' dysfunctional family, partying too much, hating her job, etc. She's living the young, single life that happens in Seattle, New York, London, and a hundred other large cities. We like Lucy, no--we love Lucy, because we get a glimpse into her neuroses, and into her thinking as she realizes she IS neurotic. <br />The claims of predictability are all to true, however. Read the first three chapters and you're pretty sure you can guess the ending--and unless you've never seen or read a romantic comedy, you're guess will be correct. Nevertheless, the unique laugh-out-loud writing kept me going and despite the unoriginal plot, I really liked the book.<br />I didn't love the book, even if I loved the characters. I kept picturing the movie that ought to be made out of it--it seemed it was written with a movie in mind. I finished the book in two days, skipping ahead to the ending at one point and then going back to read the rest. My interest in the book almost waned, and it was going to be banished to the nightstand never to be read again. But I made it through the end and have to say that the book is a good, if not terribly insightful, read. It's great for a boring Tuesday night (don't give up your perfectly good weekend for it). A nice airport read perhaps.<br />So, with that lukewarmish review out of the way, I do have to say that my next book is &quot;Last Chance Saloon.&quot;  Keyes is obviously good enough to keep me buying her books and reading them. She makes me laugh, for heaven's sake! And we all need a laugh now and again even if we know how the story goes. Predicability isn't all that bad--it's the laughter andthe oh-so-believable characters that keep me coming back. <br />Don't buy this book expecting a masterpiece. Buy it expecting to be simply entertained. It's not intellectual, it's not stimulating, it's not thrilling. It's just plain fun. Now, have at it!	2001-08-21

I also love the history of words, the meanings behind the words we use--yet never before have I loved the HISTORY of a DICTIONARY. Odd thing to read about, yes? No. <br />This book is a fantastic history of the evolution of the greatest English dictionary ever created. More fabulously, it details the friendship between two men--both with unique minds--and how that friendship influenced their lives and the dictionary. <br />A good (and thin) read. And with a bonus &quot;call for readers&quot; at the end, we are given chance to contribute. Although it's doubtful that any single person could contribute half as much as the &quot;Madman&quot; did.	2001-07-18
US	52822769	R2RAYNAPFIC0Z6	0345384563	286200112	A History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity and Islam	Books	5	37	45	N	N	And what a history it is...	&quot;Human beings cannot endure emptiness and desolation; they will fill the vacuum by creating a new focus of meaning. . . .we should, perhaps, ponder the history of God for some lessons and warnings.&quot; --- last paragraph of Armstrong's book.<br />The jacket points out that Armstrong teaches at the Leo Baeck College for the Study of Judaism and the Training of Rabbis and Teachers (as well as having spent seven years as a nun). Her academic knowledge more than shows--which is why I don't understand the reviews that claimed she was terribly biased. The book seemed to take a step back and objectively review the HISTORY of God, rather than pass judgement on one religion or another. <br />Armstrong demonstrates that through time, humanity has always sought to fill the void of unknowing by seeking a higher power. Thus, God will always exist, even in our increasingly godless society. She follows Man's God through history--from the dawn of time until now, and examines the reasons for the different concepts of God between the Monotheists (and even modern atheists and skeptics).<br />The book is complete. It's a tough read though--with a scholarly tone and complex sentence structures. It's not a beach book or even an airplane read. But it's worth your time and money if you're interested in the histories of both our most enduring concept/being (God) and of the interplay between religion and man.	2001-07-18

I sat outside in a lawn chair for a weekend, relaxing and absorbing her book. Her book didn't sap brain power--which is why it's called a good &quot;beach read.&quot; It was fun, easy, and a suprisingly light read--considering the subject.<br />Rachel is an out-of-control independent woman. Smart, witty, could-have-been-successful-in-another-life type person. She's also a coke-head and a drunk--which leads us to her holiday--a trip to rehab where she is (predictably) certain she is not at all like the rest of the addicts. We get to know her family, and learn about her friends through flashback-type scenes. <br />The only downside is the aforementioned predictability of the book. Keye's writing style makes up for it though, and while we expect what's going to happen next, we love reading it anyway because we're sure to laugh between takes. There are a few suprises--but not many. Keyes is an excellent writer. She's chatty and intelligently witty. I'll be picking up her other books, and hope for more of the same!	2001-07-17
US	52822769	R3OKXG6PCIDB9O	0671648454	31184604	Women on Top	Books	5	37	40	N	N	Go Nancy!	I've owned this book for years, and it hasn't left my beside in all that time. When I bought it, I was in my twenties, and it made me realize that fantasy lives were not restricted to men. And that my fantasies were normal--even (gasp) healthy!  Did I learn that from Friday? Nope. I ignored her introductions, as I'm sure most of us did. I figure it out from the numerous women who wrote her and shared their intimate moments. Although our fantasies may differ, they reaffirm that we have every right to relish our own sexuality.<br />On a side note: the Editorial review really ticked me off. Why is it just fine for men to fantasize using &quot;dirty&quot; words but if we use them, we're no longer feminine? Who declares we must be &quot;dainty&quot; in order to be evolved? Just know when you buy this book that it's not the flowery language you'll find in your drug store romance novel. It's real (sometimes a little out there, but real nonetheless).<br />I'm not embarrassed to admit that Nancy Friday's books come very close to being a woman's equivalent to Penthouse. We love the words--the men love the pictures. (okay, so I'm not embarrassed unless my mother-in-law reads this) It's all healthy. Go Nancy!	2001-06-25

Well, maybe it doesn't explain that much. But if you've ever wondered why your sister was an atheist and your brother claims to see visions, you'll find an explanation here. Dr. Ramachandran does go into great detail about the &quot;oddities&quot; we perceive in other peoples' characters, and how they may be explained by biology.  I would have given the book four and a half stars if I had the option--the book would have lost half a star for redundancy. The author tends to repeat himself; however, it doesn't detract too much from readability (and enjoyability). This book is an easy read--I read it on a coast-to-coast airplane flight and it saved me from watching a mind-numbing (no pun intended) movie. I'd recommend skipping whatever fiction you were about to pick up, and exploring your brain a bit with this book. You'll never look at your brother, the prophet, the same again.	2001-06-02

Genn was my grandpa and I love his books simply because I'm his granddaughter and he was one of my heroes. The truth is, if you want an up-to-date text, this is not the one to buy. If you want an older and outdated text by the man who owned Genn Technical Institute in Hollywood, years and years ago, this is the one to buy. It's a good insight into how much has changed and how the electronic industry has evolved...and how much is has stayed the same. Thanks for the legacy granddad!	2001-03-23

Ever laughed out loud while crunching numbers? Don't worry--neither had I until I read this book. And any book that makes me smile when I'm doing math has got to be a winner.<BR><BR> Yes, Gonick has done it again. I bought the CG-genetics a while back, and loved it. So when I went hunting for a good 'refresher' stats book, I picked up this one.<BR><BR> I wasn't disappointed. Gonick (et al) has great talent for presenting information in a way that almost fools you into thinking you're not learning, but rather, having fun. And although this book wasn't as &quot;easy&quot; to get into as his Genetics book, I believe it's because I'm less familiar with this subject. <BR><BR> Careful though--as others have mentioned, you can't be fooled into thinking this book is THE way to learn statistics. You have to be pretty comfortable with algebra, and pretty determined to read through the book in order to take anything away from it. And don't try this book as a stand-alone or you'll end up with the same frustration you'd have with a college textbook.	2001-03-04

It's just as sweet as the candy they munched on while we read it, only with a moral lesson barely hidden under the sugar. <br />We all know Mr. Hatch--he's that grumpy old man down the street or the weird guy who catches the bus on the corner. Not only do we know him, but odds are, we have all felt like a Mr. Hatch at some point in our lives--slightly outcast, a little unloved or forgotten. What we discover is that although Mr. Hatch WAS unloved and forgotten, it was truly his own behaviour that isolated him from his world. For the Hatch in us, we learn the power of positive action; for the side of us that looks at the Hatches of the world and judges, it's a reminder that we don't really know them, and that simple acts of kindness can mean so very much. <br />The book is a little predictable, but it's a children's book and the predictability is not only acceptable, but needed. <br />It's a winner--and one I'll treasure long after Valentine's Day.	2001-02-26

Here's my hope though: that those who aren't diehards but trying to learn to be romantic will pick up this book. My confession: I bought this book for a very unromantic guy I know--and gave it to both of us for Valentine's day. The jury is still out on whether it will &quot;work&quot; or not, but either way, I got my money's worth. It was short and sweet. The text was quick, with realistic and easy to implement ideas.  It's not in my &quot;top 1000 books&quot; list--but I don't think it was written for the NY Times Best Seller list. Much of the book reads like those romance articles you'd find in Woman's magazines. If you buy this book, take it for what it is: romantic fluff. Don't expect more and you won't be disappointed. If you buy it exactly for the fluff--you'll love it.	2001-02-26

I just couldn't do it. Instead, I found myself skipping through the last four chapters, hunting for the &quot;interesting parts&quot; and reading just enough to make sure I wasn't cheating myself out of a good book. I wasn't. Much has been written about the author's &quot;ear for language.&quot; To me, it seemed liked forced poetic language; flowery, contrived, and trite. It would have worked in small doses, but soon her style began to grate on my senses. I had a hard time believing anyone could wade through it and think it was anything close to realistic. The story was interesting in the beginning and the character development was good. But it seemed the author became bored with her own story, and what was great character development fell flat midway through. I'd probably enjoy this author's short stories, but I think I'll skip her next novel. Unless you're a woman planning one of those long nights in the bathtub, surrounded by candles and wine, I'd suggest skipping the book.	2001-02-17

Thankfully, King has done that for me (for us). He's written The Book I hope will be used in my kids' creative writing classes. Everyone who reads his book will understand much of what he writes about--the insatiable desire to read, the inborn urge to write, the importance of knowing the rules (and knowing when to break them). In only 228 pages, King gives us a biography and a textbook. His writing is frank, crisp, and surprisingly chatty. Reading it satisfied a day and a half of that insatiable desire, provided me insight into one of the most popular modern authors, and taught me more than four years of writing classes. If you've always dreamed of selling your words, buy this book. Then put it down and write.	2001-02-17

In an ideal world, the author would have written just for me: reordered the chapters, gone into greater detail for some topics and less for others, and inserted images that pertained to the level of detail I needed. However, the world isn't ideal. The book comes as close as any text can to meeting the needs of readers who need the book as a fundamental learning aid and as a reference guide. However, although it's jam-packed with information, it's a little tedious reading through the elementary text to get to what you need. Perhaps he needs to split the book into two texts: an Introductory Genes (Green Genes?) and an advanced text. Overall, worth the money.	2000-09-26
