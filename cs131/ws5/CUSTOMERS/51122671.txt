Author even admits the same in the preface, as the book is based on a composite of real stories. <br /> <br />The book is a snapshot of life in the 1950s/early 60s, when segregation was in full swing in the US.  The book does character sketches well and develops themes by suggestion, like a good writer is supposed to, rather than just mechanically describing something. <br /> <br />The book fails miserably in the ending--a completely contrived, \\"Duex Ex Machina\\" ending, where characters die or conveniently disappear.  Thus the ending a cliche that sours the whole book.  Seems like the writer got tired, killed off some characters, and finished.  I would have given the book a five but for the ending. <br /> <br />As for humour, it is simply 50s style realism with a sickening sugar coating to make it more easy to swallow.  I didn't think it was all that funny, as the racial typecasting and moral preaching is grating.  But it also is consistent with the mindset of the characters, who are essentially hypocritical racists. <br /> <br />Have fun.	2005-06-05

Not that there's anything wrong with that. <br /> <br />Now about the book:  it is written poorly, the prose is wooden.  Quite tedious to read because it is written in a polemic but not in an entertaining way.  Kind of like the reviews on Amazon that give it five stars.  If you dislike that \\"Soviet style\\" retoric, then this book is heavy slogging. <br /> <br />As to specifics:  mostly anectodal evidence is given of 'pork', but nothing concrete.  Adding the numbers, and if you've read Bovard's (a much better writer) expose, you will know that pork is between $1 billion to (at most) $100 billion.  Nothing to write home about when the Federal budget is $2500 billion.   <br /> <br />Slightly more interesting than the travails of a 50 year old Congressional staffer who apparently knew he was due to retire and started ghost writing under the name \\"Sparticus\\" (and the wrinkles of how he got fired are told in this book), is stuff that only a real Washington insider might appreciate:  how, for example, the GAO is, despite their popular image as a watchdog, considered by Beltway insiders as incompetent and superficial.  Also you can read between the lines and see which Senators are bombastic (Stevens, Domenici) and which the author admires (Jarvis, Kassebaum, and sometimes, in a backhand way, McCain). <br /> <br />A much, much better book about how government operates when it comes to pork is anything by James Bovard (if you like over-the-top bombast mixed with much more fact than this book), or, if you like humor, try \\"Parliament of Whores\\" by P. J. O'Rourke, which is actually pretty good in explaning things, besides being funny.	2005-02-06

So how did the author get away with this statistic?  Easy.

However, Eddington's proof was flawed, as pointed out in the book \\"Einstein's Luck\\" by J. Walker.  This does not detract from the point of the example (moral and scientific relativism ushered in the 20th century), but it's a caveat to watch out for:  just because something is referenced by a footnote doesn't make it true.

It should have considered the possibility from a monetarist point of view that the Gold Standard did not work because central bankers, rather than tens of thousands of gold-trading merchants, were controlling the flow of gold.  As such, central bankers are prone to collusion and game theory takes over, rather than economic self-interest, which is the real reason IMO why the gold standard failed in the 1930s.   <br /> <br />But it is a useful book to highlight the blow-by-blow account of the failure of the gold standard (i.e., fixed money supply) in the 1930s Great Depression (which itself was caused by central bankers), if you read between the lines.	2005-01-16

The book is short and not packed with sidelights.  Along the way the author draws parallels with today's headlines, and shows they are old news (\\"war on drugs\\" was tried by the Spanish; \\"zero tolerance\\" by the early FDA in the US during 1905). <br /> <br />As a bonus, the author explains medical oddities, as he is also the world's expert on drug effects on the body.  For example, why cocaine injected is more toxic than cocaine ingested, why cocaine injected in certain parts of the body leads to fatalities while in other parts of the body does not, and why cocaine and wine (which was the basis for a very popular wine 150 years ago--Mariani wine which was one of the first 'celebrity endorsed' mass advertisement product) is more potent than cocaine alone.  Also the origins of Merck (cocaine marketer) and Freud (unwitting or witting promoter), and the different species of cocaine plants (some more potent than others).   <br /> <br />Packed with information:  Coca-cola and cocaine (not enough drug to give you a buzz); the government sponsored use of cocaine (shades of today's North Korea); early explorers promoting cocaine when they should have known better; urban legends and cocaine; why pure cocaine will induce animals to kill themselves from overdose (unlike morphine, another alkaloid based drug). <br /> <br />As a bonus, you learn about cocaine manufacture (coca leaves plus lime, then add to the solution an organic solvent like kerosene, gasoline, or alcohol, then precipitate the solution into a solid by adding an acid (since the solution is base) like sulfuric acid, to yield almost pure cocaine powder). <br /> <br />Very good book for the intelligent person.  You can clearly see that today's 'war on drugs' is distorted:  any traveler to South America can drink \\"matte de coca\\" (Coca leaf tea) and not get high, but try that in North America and the prison lobby will send you to jail.   <br /> <br />Dr. Karch's book is neutral on this issue butimplicitly argues against a blunderbuss approach.	2004-12-19

WORTH THE PRICE OF THE BOOK.  This is a spectacular chapter.  I won't spoil it with spoilers but the circumstantial evidence is very strong that the Russian FSB (like FBI) basically planted bombs in 1999 to justify a second invasion of Chechyna.  But I will give one spoiler:  the Duma, on a pro-Kremlin party block vote, voted to seal the Ryazan incident and all materials used for the next 75 years and forbade an investigation of what really happened.  The official explanation (which defies logic):  'The FSB was conducting an unannounced training exercise involving non-explosive materials with civilians as the target, and were caught by mistake by the local Ryazan police.  The local police, despite having state of the art bomb detecting equipment and many hours of defusing actual bombs, misdiagnosed the material used in the training exercise as hexogen; in fact it was sugar.  The FSB attempted to flee the area undetected after the bomb was found in accordance with training procedures, to see if they could escape\\"  Do you think this would fly with the American people?

Value add, Russian style.  Read this to see what it costs to convict a mafiya member in Russia--a lot of innocent people have to first die, even die testifying.  And our friend  Bykov?

As such, their relevance, impact and even credibility are suspect.  Who can have predicted China would be the standard for Communist market reform in the 1980s?  Who predicted Russia would collapse in the 1990s?

I haven't read this book, but it seems like a travellers tall tale, aka. tour-guide history to amuse city slickers.  Better to rent City Slickers.<br /><br />Some facts to ponder:<br /><br />--gold in the natural state, as in free Au nuggets, was depleted by prehistoric man.  So if gold nuggets exist, why didn't the Apache themselves pick it up?  Do we really need crusty old miners?  That said, if you're talking sluicing gold using heavy industrial equipment, including mercury/ quicksilver, that's a different story.  But the idea of old english-speaking miners finding gold nuggets lying around is ludicrous<br /><br />--if there's gold in them thar hills, somebody would have found it, not unlike Suiter Mill (CA '49ers); Virginia City (Ag), NV; Klondyke gold fields, even (and especially) South Africa, where the gold is a mile below the surface.  Point being: real gold is like money, it attacts real people.  \\"Lost gold\\" only attracts readers (gullible readers) and tourists.<br /><br />I give the book two stars since the author knows what he is talking about:  spinning a yarn, even a plausible yarn.  For that he gets credit.	2004-10-28

A great book!  well written, fast faced, well researched (I like footnotes), authentic, believeable, cross-checked with other books, but, at the end of the day, since it is a derivative work based on a seaman's tale, there is a small chance (around 10% IMO, just guessing) that this tale is largely fiction, not unlike certain aspects of Marco Polo's tale.  In fact, even the author says the narratives by the two surviving sailors is contradictory in places. But in no way should that detract from the story.  Even if half of it is fiction the other half would still merit a book.  Neither should it detract that certain sailors lived (but others did not).  If anything, it adds to the mystery as to who lived and who did not.  Further, the book is excellent in describing the lifestyle and morals of the desert nomads, who largely live the same way today.	2004-03-01

Consider these stats: Industrial accidents comprise 1.1 million deaths, which exceeds the average annual deaths from road accidents (999,000), war (502,000), violence (563,000) and HIV/AIDS (312,000).  Of this total deaths from asbestos exposure equals about 100,000 (9% of all industrial accidents, and only 2.9% of the total deaths above).<br />Yet the mesothelioma lobby would want you to believe that asbestos--which is a mineral known since ancient times--will kill everybody unless it's totally removed.<br />This reporter tries to ape Aron Brockovitch, and plays up to the hype.  In fact, it gives just one side of the story.  The other side is this:  the people at Libby supported asbestos while the going was good, yet when demand died down, they turned against it.  You cannot have your cake and eat it too.  Harsh but true.  BTW, I have nothing against cancer sufferors, just pointing out that there's a lobby of lawyers who make a killing filing lawsuits on behalf of mesothelioma victims.  And this book plays to that lobby.	2004-01-26

This is a very cool book because the synthesis is done by a academian who writes like a potboiler novelist!  The paragraphs are shock full of references to deep philosophical and academic treatises, but done in an entertaining manner.  Every paragraph is like poetry.  Excellent derivative work.<br />In a nutshell, the author is taking a theme first exposed by Alvin Toffler &quot;Future Shock&quot; &quot;Third Wave&quot; and developing it further to synthesize the way the world's economies have performed in the last 20 years.<br />Outstanding!  Don't be put off by the seeming &quot;facist&quot; or &quot;harsh&quot; tone of some of this writing--the author is tell you how it is, not how it should be--hence the term &quot;barbarian&quot; in the title.  The old guard will attempt to smooth over raw, naked capitalism but in the opinion of the author it will be a losing battle (I'm not so sure, since I believe most old people, having been raised by the Welfare State, will never go quietly, so it will take another generation or two to renounce the Nanny Welfare State.<br />I give it four stars not five because the opinions are thrown out without much argument or development.  It is a derivative work where you have to understand some background first.  So it's not really a beginner's book.	2003-12-17

What Watson and others (Purdy, Soltis, Hubner) point out is that at any given position, you can have one or the other element dominate, oftentimes it's the tactical element in a seemingly winning position (i.e. 'defense' in a 'lost' position).  The rule of thumb is that the stronger player will find a way to win.  The reason computers are so good at chess is that they largely ignore positional understanding for tactics--and it works.   This is the basis for anti-positional chess like Steinitz played. So keep a fresh eye.<br />I never like a book that has cult status, like Niemzovitch's or Stilman's book, so I give this useful book 2 stars.	2003-07-22

(if privatize, do you grandfather criminals, who employ the best people anyway, and give them a head start?).<br />And so on.

This is how Professor Arpad Elo (inventor of the Gaussian Elo distribution in chess) made chess a highly predictable encounter.  With Sabermetrics and the A's, Bluejays, etc, perhaps the same will happen in baseball as in chess.  But you need to have a large sample size, and the problem with baseball is physical injuries can make stats obsolete overnight (not as true in mind games, although chess players on occasion do go insane, and age is a factor even in chess).  So there is always the element of chance in sport.  But professional management is long overdue, considering how much money is spent in this sport.<br />All in all a good book.

Sometimes I think they are more Oriental that Western, and the Byzantine tradition merely reinforces that.<br />If you want Figes to appologize for the 1 to several million Ukrainians that starved to death (remember, they also culled their cattle rather than collectivize), then you might as well ask the Turks to appologize for any atrocities committed during the Greek/ Armenian crisis.

The unusually cold weather created an anomaly where the ice would not melt under the sled runners, which created friction that slowed down the men fatally.  But for this, Scott might have survived.   Also interesting in the PBS series is speculation that the last two members of Scott's team, including his physician, stayed with Scott out of loyalty or Hippocratic Oath rather than necessity (there was no blizzard that lasted 10 days).  Thus they died heroically but unnecessarily.   Finally Scotts' weatherman was within 5% accurate for the average steady-state temperature conditions--and was a pioneer for Antartic weather prediction.  He could not of course predict that a fatal temperature inversion would result in abnormally cold weather for a spell.  I'm afraid that the book, since it was published before these facts came out, may be a bit too biased against Scott, who, nevertheless was obviously not as good as his Norwegian counterpart, since Scott apparently did not include a large enough factor of safety.  Then again, that's what exploration is all about--getting close to the envelope of danger.  Nothing succeeds like success.	2003-01-16

This book is not up to Brookings Institute standards, perhaps that explains the forward written by the Brookings chief, where he says the books 'conspiracy' theme is interesting, to deflect criticism that the book relies too much on secondary sources.<br />Basically the premise is old news:  Japan runs a current account surplus because it refuses to import and only exports, which creates a weaker than normal yen.  The dollar surplus then has to be either invested overseas (hence the Japanese overpay for US investments), or plowed into assets by JP banks to avoid the yen from being strengthened.  But that this is part of a 'conspiracy' is not really fleshed out.  The book relies too much on secondary sources.  And it is not clear to me that the currency imbalance is the root of Japan's ills (this is the central premise of the book).  Note that Japan import/exports are only 10% of the GNP, (not unlike the 15% in the US), and thus the lack of demand in JP from the remaining 90% of the GNP is perhaps the real cause of the 10 year recession there.  Also other Asian countries do the same thing as JP (namely, keep their currency weaker than it should; ration credit; restrict labor mobility and labor wage rates); how do their economies escape the JP trap of recession?  Can it be that other reasons are at fault for JP's demise, such as JP is getting older?  These issues are not discussed.<br />Basically the book is a 20 page white paper made into a several hundred page book, and the tone is too 'alarmist'.  The most interesting points are made when discussing politics, and how the Ministry of Trade decides who is going to live or die vis-a-vis the 'walking zombie' companies.  Of course the same things happened in the US (credit rationing until the 1970s; bank failures in the late 1980s, where the government decided which banks were to be taken over; and a merchantilist philosophy of keeping the dollar strong, which keeps inflation low in the US but results in the mirror opposite but also dangerous problem as in Japan--current account deficits, or living beyond your means).	2003-01-07

You cannot use fiat money in a barter system, unless you have the full faith and credit of the state, and, implicitly, a relatively limited (but one that can expand) supply.<br />Now this journalist's book will no doubt attempt to put a spin on this issue.  No doubt the issue of private banks versus cartelized Federal Reserve system will or should be discussed; as will be the issue of hard assets versus a paper money supply that is inflated to keep prices rising as the real economy rises (this is necessary to prevent falling prices, which most people are not familiar with; a rising money supply, even a gold-backed money supply, is necessary when an economy is expanding, as the 16th century Spanish conquistadors found out); how money supply can be expanded before people realize the sleight of hand (hence J.M. Keynes great insight about temporarily stimulating demand by printing money); and a few &quot;us-versus-them&quot;, &quot;Wall Street versus Main Street&quot; or Intl Semetic or other such nonsense retoric will be suggested to bait the reader and keep things interesting.  Finally to appease the Gold Bug nuts, a sop will be thrown in their direction about a return to the Gold standard.  Maybe even the Silver standard for W.G.Bryant fans.<br />Disclaimer:  I have not read the book, but have ordered it.

It will turn you on to supply side economics.<br />Basically the premise of the book--that where there is a shortage, the price of the good will rise and cause either conservation, a search for substitutes or a search for more of what is in shortage, is basic economic theory.  But how this is illustrated is absolutely fascinating--the authors look at a series of historical 'crisis', from oil (modern age) to wood for fuel (16th Century England, and the subsitution of coal, which helped make England a powerhouse, literally) to a shortage of wood timbre for ship building in ancient Greece (forced a new design for ships), to, in a specutacular climax--the shortage of flint in prehistoric man's world! (and how it was overcome, namely, either recycling or searching for more flint).<br />The authors score points blasting the &quot;doomsday environmentalists&quot; (e.g., Rome Club environmentalists) who are always preaching only limiting demand without realising that supply can be increased where there is incentive, and for being Cassandras.  These doomsday types typically focus on market failures such as Tragedy of the Commons and try to generalize from that unique failure, but I digress.<br />My only criticism is that the book is so seemlessly written and logical you almost suspect the facts are made up or glossed over--especially the speculative last chapter on prehistoric man, where the evidence surely is sketchy.  But don't let this dissuade you from reading this short and sweet book.<br />BTW, another economics book for non-economists that has a paradoxical message that I highly recommend is the new book by William Easterly, &quot;The Elusive Quest for Growth&quot;.	2002-10-26

The fact is, bioweapons are extremely poor vector for mass destruction (compared to nuclear weapons), because of the dispersal problem:  getting people infected with deadly disease is harder than it looks.

If they did (like Marbury virus, Ebola virus) they would not be around after a few generations.  <br />Also beware of any book written for the masses that \\"reads like a thriller\\".

I almost think the author threw together this book so he can claim that he is a professor who has published.  By the way, the author should educate himself when railing against the U.S. embargo as the root of Cuba's ills--according to the Cato Institute, the embargo is not that disruptive--the fault lies in communism.  But again, I don't care about politics, just trying to point out how limited in scope the author's views are....braying about politics, never having fun...on and on and on and...well, I've made my point.	2001-07-22

The best of the lot, by far.  Trust me, I have a dozen books on MFC, and this one finally cracked the code.<br />The author is an old timer and he states he has seen a number of approaches to MFC and knows what works and what does not work.  Reminds me of the whimsical adage about how when an old man (like the author) says something positive, you can believe it will happen, whereas if an old man says something is impossible, or will never happen, you can believe it will probably happen.  This author is an experienced teacher of MFC C++ and he knows how to open students eyes, starting from Console Programming, moving to a simple MFC, and then to the Wizards-generated code.	2001-07-20

Read the books by the 'leftist' economists like John Kenneth Galbraith, whose works are dated (with the exception of the &quot;Great Crash&quot;, which stuck to facts), and compare.  Almost all of Friedman's ideas are now &quot;mainstream&quot;, yet when he proposed them (when top tax rates were 90%), the mandra was John Kennedy's &quot;Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country&quot; (which Friedman points out is wrong on both counts--the paternistic country and giving service to your country blindly).<br />In short, the book is a gem.  As for objectivity, note that economics has been classified as &quot;political economics&quot; because it is possible to defend any system --choose your poison-- including slavery, communism, rigid wage and price controls (caste system, like old India and Byzantium).  None of these systems are necessarily unstable (Byzantium lasted 1000 years, India longer, the Soviet Union lasted several generations), but if you value economic output and liberalism in the classic sense (freedom of action), then Friedman's libertarian is the best.  Friedman points out that with capitalism you get more inequality because everybody has the ability to prosper, and differences are magnified (nobody measures absolute wealth but relative wealth).  A short story by Kurt Vonnegut comes to mind where people were all kept the same in a race of ability (no inequality) by tying lead weights around their legs.  If you think handicapping like this is 'fair' then you will not like Friedman's capitalism.  Finally note that Friedman is not a proponent of no government, just government to handle &quot;neighborhood effects&quot; (aka 'externalities'), like air pollution, where in theory it is difficult to negotiate away problems like this (actually some modern economists have found many such externalities are not that common--yes you can negotiate with your neighbors, and don't need thegovernment, for many problems that seem like externalities).	2001-05-25

US	51122671	R5R4VLO64YMJ	0684842963	202343708	50 Short Science Fiction Tales	Books	4	2	5	N	N	Prose Poetry / Idea sketches / good anthology	The only complaint about this book is that the stories are sometimes so short that the characters cannot be developed.  But the themes are excellent.  Like poetry, just the skeletal outline of the plot will please  you.  Three of my favorites (relying on memory, I read this book years ago)  were A.C. Clarke's story of the haunted space suit, &quot;Columbus is a  dope&quot; by ?  (both ironically comical) and the provocative  &quot;hunted aliens&quot;. I think the excellent &quot;Time Machine and  Dinosaur Hunter&quot; story is in here too, but I'm not sure.<br />Also read  Jorge Luis Borges &quot;Labyrinths&quot; (one anthology) for a better  treatment of the same theme (short stories with a sci-fi element).	2000-07-19

Also Service's writing style for this book was not fluid, it was too disjointed.  Let me try and give an example (from the book).  On second thought, it would be too wordy.  The best I can say is that the prose just doesn't flow for me.   This is not good in a narrative historical book like this.  Writing style  would not matter if it was an &quot;encyclopedia&quot;, like Oxford puts  out, as in a &quot;Who's Who in the USSR&quot;, etc.<br />On the other hand,  there are a lot of facts crammed in lots of pages, and the index is not  bad.  Further, Service does hit a few home runs with opinionated paragraphs  that are quite funny (e.g. &quot;flying coffins&quot;, how Stalin's Air  Minister was executed for making a bad joke; &quot;chemically treated  corpses&quot;, how Stalin's body lying in state caused a stampede that  killed people, which the author attributes satirically to Stalin ruling  from the grave; Brezhnev being plopped into his grave uncerimoniously to  indicate he has fallen out of favor (literally) with the Kremlin.  Also the  author seems to rely too much on secondary sources it seems (then again, I  suspect with the Soviets often destroying evidence, this is not unexpected  in the field).	2000-03-14

Run these games through Fritz (Chessbase) for example (a .CBF format of the games found in this book is available at the Ossimitz Chess page at the fortunecity  website) and almost on every third page a variation of Vukovic's will be in  error; some of the errors allow one side to escape with a draw instead of a  forced win.  GM John Nunn has done a good job with footnotes pointing out a  lot of these mistakes<br />Another annoying thing is that supposedly  outstanding (!) moves are not the best move (Fritz or any computer program  will point this out in 'watch mode').  So if you are trying to guess the  move, sometimes you will find yourself 'stumped' until you realize there is  no 'best' move.<br />That said, I still like this book because it shows how to  win in OTB play against humans using aggresive play, where sometimes a  shock move is useful (GM Tal proved this holds).<br />I am a expert player.  If you are a beginner some of the games here will 'shock' you since they  seem to lose material, until the lines are played out.<br />All in all a  useful book, I also like for tactics Averback's Tactics book (if you can  find it)	2000-01-23
