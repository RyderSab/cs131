This is not one of those books. <br /> <br />Aside from the many wild and unsupported statements the author makes, the \\"meat\\" of the book is completely lacking in substance. For example, let's look at Chapter TGIS (the chapters are named not numbered): the thrust of this chapter is that God rested on the 7th day AND the number 7 is used in many places in the Bible. That's it. The author cites many passages in the Bible where the number 7 was used. And this supposedly proves that Jesus Christ (not Yahweh) wrote or inspired the Bible. How does the number 7 prove this conclusion? Who knows. The author makes no attempt to show any logcal connection because of course there is no logical connection. Biblical writers knew of numbers, including the number 7. They thought some of these numbers were good (or bad). So what? <br /> <br />If you're really interested in these types of topics, read Tony Bushby's The Secret in the Bible.	2005-09-15

Winn reveals, in detail, with extensive citations to the Quran's own passages, how this religion is oriented toward anything but peace. Islam promotes the killing of non believers, treating non believers as animals, and treating non believers with dishonesty and disdain.    If you want to know what kind of people support this kind of religion, just read the one star reviews below--ignorance, stupidity and above all dishonesty are their hallmarks.

When you realize that he apparently is serious, there is a tendency toward laughter. Then you realize that he really IS SERIOUS. He honestly believes that we have too much liberty in the US and that newspapers have too much freedom to publish. Instead of liberty, what does Hutton cherish? The \\"primacy of society\\". Which is? As best as I can determine, the primacy of society is greater control of society by government, those wise and kind overseers who want only what is best for us poor ignorant uneducated masses.     Hutton should have been born 80 years ago, in Germany. Or 50 years ago in the Soviet Union. He would have loved it.	2005-05-30

Pandering to fiscal, ethnic and racial minorities, criticizing Republicans at every step no matter what their policies may be, yelling at Republicans and blocking legislation.

What's the problem? There is no pyramid that is referred to as \\"the Pyramid of Giza\\". There are three large pyramids at Giza (6 total). There are also no steps on the Giza pyramids, although I could forgive Brown for his poor word choice in that respect if he were not consistently guilty of poor word choice throughout the book.    People who are poorly educated enjoy Brown's writing because he introduces them to concepts and places with which they are unfamiliar. They do not know that his descriptions of these concepts and places are often inaccurate. They're not aware that Brown, despite allegedly having been an English teacher, is not always comfortable with the English language. On the other hand, if you're a college grad with rudimentary English skills and some familiarity with basic historical themes and scientific concepts, you might find Brown's writing somewhat annoying.     Fifty years ago we had popular writers like Edgar Rice Burroughs who wrote exciting escapist potboilers. Brown appeals to many of the same readers with the distinction that Burroughs was a far better writer than Brown.    I do give Brown two stars rather than one because he does have some story telling ability.	2005-04-24

He is clearly not a great writer and does not always do a good job explaining his ideas. But I agree that once you sift through his prose you will find that he does an excellent job of tearing apart the underpinnings of modern physics. If you think that modern physics is the pinnacle of human thought you will not enjoy this book and probably will not understand it either.<br /><br />As for the reviewer below who concludes that \\"logic does not apply\\" to physics, that is technically true, but logic does indeed apply to the manner in which we use our intellects to arrive at those \\"laws\\". Bros argues, successfully I believe, that the thought processes scientists have used to arrive at the modern \\"laws\\" of physics are not completely logical. And therefore the \\"laws\\" of physics are not \\"laws\\" and need to be reevaluated in the light of logical thought.<br /><br />I think it's clear that Bros will be ignored now but 50-100 years from now he will recognized as a courageous genius.

While Burroughs was denigrated as being a &quot;pulp&quot; novelist for most of his literary career, he was clearly a better writer than the vast majority of genre writers who publish today, and he was also a better story teller than most. The complaint of a reviewer that Burroughs was an obsessive racist would be hilarious if it weren't so ignorantly misguided. Similarly the complaint that Burroughs had no ear for dialogue is drenched in ignorance. The dialogue of early 20th century America is not the dialogue of late 20th century England, a fact that should not need explaining, but unfortunately explication is needed for those who who lack the most rudimentary of analytical faculties. I find Hemingway to have a tin ear for dialogue because the people I grew up with didn't speak like Hemingway characters at all, but I don't criticize Hemingway for that and suspect that he accurately recorded the cadence of his fellows. Burroughs had a good feel for the common man of the early 20th century, which is one reason his books still sell.<br />The Land That Time Forgot is a great adventure by a very good fantasy writer.

Unfortunately, don't expect the medical establishment to spend a dime researching it. There's no money to be made from telling women to take off their bras (not in this  context anyway) so there will be no research on this issue. This book is  it.<br />The criticism that this book is not written by MDs wrings quite  hollow, since MDs don't know what causes breast cancer. The medical  profession continues to view cancer as a profit maker (see The Cancer  Industry by Moss) and goes out of its way to persecute/prosecute anyone who  would dare to cure cancer by a non-AMA approved method (see The Persecution  of Gaston Naessens by Bird). The medical establishment certainly has no  interest in a cancer cure that's free and doesn't require a doctor.<br />The  criticism that ths book does not adequately account for all variables is  also hilarious since there are no medical experiments in the history of  mankind that do so. Real life always throws more variables at a situation  than can ever be accounted for in a controlled study.

It's interesting that it has been criticized by shoppers for simply explaining why shoppers don't buy, which isn't news to shoppers. But the book wasn't really written for shoppers-it was written for sellers, who understand little of the shoppers predicament.<br />Now if  someone would just give this book to the powers that be at Blockbuster  Video and the other stores where the staff bends over backward to  say &quot;hi&quot; as you walk in (who cares?) but disappear as soon as you  have picked your video...	2000-04-23

The book is bereft of intelligent analysis and is primarily a book about Horgan and his emotional state, since he has no discernible  intellectual state.<br />One reviewer called the book &quot;sophomoric&quot;,  a comment with which I disagree since I consider even that comment to be  far more positive than the book merits.<br />Horgan's basic thesis is that the  major scientific fields have reached resolution aside from  &quot;details&quot;. Maybe I've missed some spectacular recent announcement  but we still still have no idea what gravity is. Yes, I know it's supposed  to be a function of mass (try proving that point) but that still doesn't  tell us what gravity is, or why it is. Nor do we know how life began. Or  what life is.<br />Of course in Horgan's world these things are just details  since the only truly important issue is his ego.	2000-04-23

It's amazing how many presumably bright people buy into his hogwash. <br />For the record, I've been an atheist since I was 6 years old and have no  interest in the creationist agenda, nor in the young earth agenda. But the  evolutionary facts nevertheless suggest design. They most certainly do not  suggest accident. And while it is abundantly clear that creatures evolve,  it is just as clear that Darwinism is not the driving force behind  evolution. The fact is that we do not have any idea what drives evolution  but there does appear to be a design to it. What is so unfortunate about  Dawkin's drivel is that real evolutionary science is at a standstill and  will be until his generation dies. <br />It's hard to determine whether  Dawkins is not very bright or simply dishonest, The way in which he ignores  valid arguments against his positions and engages in ad hominem attacks  suggests the latter.	2000-04-17

A hasty and superficial take on Atlantis. It probably helped that Ellis had reached his conclusion before he &quot;researched&quot; the book.<br />Those interested in a serious book on  Atlantis might want to find the old Otto Muck book &quot;Secret of  Atlantis&quot; or the new Andrew Collins book &quot;Gateway to  Atlantis&quot;. Ellis refers briefly to the Muck book but can't say much  about it since Muck presented some complex scientific arguments and had a  probing scientific mind which Ellis most definitely does not.	2000-03-19

He has done a remarkably poor job. He ignores the probability that this shroud is  evidence of the crucifixion of someone other than Jesus. He ignores the  fact that this cloth was essentially hidden by and disowned by the Catholic  Church for hundreds of years, indicating that the Church was likely trying  to hide something. If anyone wants a serious investigation into the origin  of the shroud that is untainted by religious bias, read The Second Messiah.	1999-04-17

As someone who believes in evolution but believes Darwinism is a bad joke, this is an excellent book. While I do not necessarily agree that evolutionary progress is a sign of intelligent design, it is definitely  evidence of structure, which may or may not have an intelligent  origin.<br />The argument of irreducible complexity may be old, but it remains  unrefuted. In fact most Darwinists have spent little effort supporting  their belief system simply because it is primarily based upon faith and  support is impossible. Darwinism is a religion, nothing more and nothing  less. Darwinists who attack Behe for his religious views are hardly on  solid ground. He supports his arguments far better than his  opponents.<br />While I don't necessarily agree with Behe's final conclusions  he has done a superb job of tearing apart the religion of Darwinism. It is  nonetheless clear that evolution does occur and unfortunately neither Behe  nor the Darwinists have the slightest idea how it really works. Maybe Peter  Bros is right.	1999-02-08

To this date we're still waiting for mainstream scientists to provide a logical mechanism for Darwinism. Since they can't provide one (I'm assuming  that punctuated equilibrium was promulgated as a joke or possibly on a bet  by Gould just to see if anyone would take such an unsupported and illogical  theory seriously) their tactic has been simply to scream at anyone atacking  Darwinist theories. It will take another generation but eventually the  Darwinists will be history.<br />While one can certainly nitpick over some of  Milton's arguments (see reviews below) no one can counter his basic thesis,  which is that natural selection and random mutations do not provide a basis  for evolution. A superb job by Milton that will be appreciated by  intelligent readers everywhere, whether creationist or atheist.	1999-02-08

An amazing piece of detective work by Knight and Lomas. As usual, new insights into ancient Egyptian history are made by non-Egyptologists. Although they have been criticized by some for lack of historical  documentation, the truth is that many of their speculations are not  currently capable of proof. But their overall thesis does fit well into  known historical parameters.<br />It is unbelievable that such a recent work  is now unavailable. Conspiracy theorists might speculate that the Catholic  church doesn't want any further attention drawn to its bloody history and  has made sure the book is no longer available....	1999-02-06

There are two reasons for this: (1)The science in the fictitious work will be more realistic and better  reasoned and (2) the novel will be much more enjoyable.<br />It is amazing  that a man theoretically as bright as Tipler can be capable of such immense  self delusion and intellectual density. Virtually every significant  statement he makes in the book is based upon numerous unproven and  unsupported assumptions. His resulting conclusions are the purest of  fantasy, bearing less resemblance to reality than Burrough's Pellucidar.<br />I could cite an example of Tipler's absurdities from any page of the  book, but I'll choose one from a random page-how about page number 57?  &quot;...rather than let the earth be vaporized seven billion years from  now, our descendants would have long before taken the entire planet  apart...In the very long run, first the entire solar system, then the  entire universe of matter  will be taken apart and converted into habitat  for the expanding biosphere.&quot; Really? The assumptions underlying this  conclusion are innumerable but Tipler addresses none of them and, I  suspect, lacks the insight or intellect to identify them.<br />This book is a  colossal waste of time other than providing the subject matter for a  psychological study of the power of a man to delude himself.	1999-02-06

But if you're expecting  him to receive the Nobel Prize and accolades from the medical  establishment, think again. The sole interest of the medical establishment  is to put this man in jail.<br />The book does get bogged down in minutiae at  times and can be a bit boring, but the subject matter is so important that  there is no way I could give this book anything less than 5 stars.<br />If  anyone you know has cancer or aids, buy this book for them.	1999-02-06

Wilson has absolutely no intention of setting aside his  personal beliefs for any reason whatsoever, as revealed by his failure to  adhere to his previous statements that carbon dating would settle this  issue.<br />If anyone is truly interested in an unbiased, and possibly even  accurate, scientific analysis of how the Shroud came to be, who it  represents and why the Catholic church disowned it for the longest time,  you may want to read &quot;The Hiram Key&quot; and &quot;The Second  Messiah&quot;, by Christopher Knight and Robert Lomas.	1999-02-06

But it has always required a great deal of reading to gain some background on the historical  underpinnings of the religion. In this book Leedom has gathered together  articles on a wide range of subjects that attack the shaky foundation of  Christian mythology.<br />From Graves' &quot;Sixteen Crucified Saviors&quot;  to Thomas Paine's delightfully rational analyses of Christian  irrationality, this book is a wonderful read. The Remsburg excerpt on the  lack of any historical record for Jesus is worth the price of the book  alone (although you might also want to purchase the two Remsburg books:  &quot;The Christ&quot; and &quot;The Bible&quot;).	1999-02-06

Despite the fact that there is NO evidence to support the tomb theory (see the old William Fix book Pyramid Odyssey), the subliterate  morons who call themselves Egyptologists have stuck with it because they  lacked the intellect, imagination or integrity to initiate an original  thought. Dunn may not be 100% correct, but he's certainly on the right  path. Now I hope he gets a chance to analyze the other two large Giza  pyramids as well as the two large ones at Dashur.

The entire book is tainted somewhat by Sitchin's conclusions as to the identity of Yahweh. Sitchin clearly allows his own  religious beliefs to influence his conclusion in that regard. There is a  complete lack of historical evidence to support Sitchin on this issue and  despite his statement (p. 374) that his conclusion is &quot;quite logical  on reflection&quot;, it is in fact totally lacking in logic. Those who are  truly interested in a thoughtful analysis of Yahweh's identity should  direct themselves to Alan Alford's &quot;Gods of the New Millenium&quot;.	1999-01-17

There is no coherent structure or theme to the book, despite the provocative title. The book appears to be simply a conglomeration of  thoughts Sitchin has had on a variety of issues since his last book. Much  of the first third of the book is just a synopsis of some of the central  themes from his earlier works, certainly a waste of time for those of us  who have read those earlier works. The title represents a clear attempt to  cash in on the current interest in Bible codes, but less than a third of  the book actually discusses such codes at all. Sitchin engages in a great  deal of speculation about various codes but offers little that is new and  nothing that is definitive. The latter third of the book is sprinkled with  references to Sitchin's personal feelings about Yahweh. Despite the fact  that there is no evidence to suggest that Yahweh was the lord of the  Annunaki, and considerable evidence to suggest that Yahweh was just a  latter day trouble maker from the clan of Enlil, Sitchin makes numerous  statements designed to promote his own religious beliefs. Unfortunately it  appears that Sitchin does not intend to offer any further analysis of the  relationship of Yahweh to Anu, El, Enki, Enlil and the other Annunaki.  Apparently we will have to rely on the works of Alan Alford, Bruce Rux and  others if we want an unbiased discussion of Yahweh.	1999-01-17
