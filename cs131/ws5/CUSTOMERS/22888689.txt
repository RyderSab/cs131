Rachel, a plain Jane, on her 30th b-day sleeps with her best friend's fianc... and falls for him, and he falls back.  But what's a girl to do when her best friend, Darcy, is a self centered, egoistic and egotistic.  Will Dexter, the fianc, dump Darcy so they can be together?  One of the reasons why I love this book is because it reminded me of a friendship that I have with a friend.  It sounds bad, but thank goodness that I'm not submissive and as nice as Rachel is.  Rachel is the good girl who doesn't want to do anything out of the ordinary and is always doing the \\"right thing\\".   <br />Throughout the book, Rachel grows up and learns that you have to stand up for yourself, and not give up your happiness so someone else is happy.  She learns that you have to fight, even though there are things you'll loose, you can gain much more... like love. <br /> <br />	2005-08-28

As you know, this is a book for the bathroom with very interesting facts.  BUT THE BOOK IS TOO BIG TOO HOLD WHEN YOU'RE SITTING ON THE BATHROOM.  That was very uncomfortable.  It so huge that I was dissapointed that I couldn't take it to the bathroom.  Though has a lof of fun, educational, and interesting facts.  Useless knowledge that you might impress your friends with.  I bet you can find hundreds of conversation starters in there!	2005-07-13

I enjoyed it because I didn't have to think, just read and giggle.  The story is actually pretty clever...well, for chick lit.  I laughed and felt embarrassed for the character.  It is about a girl who is going back home on an air plane and thinks its going to crash, so she tells all her secrets to a man sitting next to her who she doesn't know.  He turns out to be her boss the next time she appears at work. If you want a light hearted comedy, definitely pick this book up.   <br /> <br />	2005-07-13

I'm sorry to all the fans of this author, but I've read a lot of romance novels, and this is at the bottom of my list.  This is a very boring book, and the writing is pretty bad.  The romance is as passionate as watching the grass grow.  Just to sum it up, the book is so dry and not interesting that I skipped most parts.  They only reason I've read this book is because I moved to a new place and didn't have any TV or computer or radio with me, and this was the last resort. Dry Dry DRY!  I give it 2 stars because I'm sure with a lot of concentration, the book is bearable, but I just really didn't like it.	2005-05-22

Well, I was surprised because I've been reading a lot of romance latley and this book was pretty refreshing.  Probably the best part about it was that the heroine wasn't some sissy scared little girl. She stood up for herslef and didn't care what people thought. The main male charachter was a little frusturating and very stubborn.  That pissed me off a little because it started to get annoying in the end.  But I still liked this book though haven't read any previous ones that go before this.	2005-05-04

It was such a refreshing read! I laughed and felt bad for her, and rooted for her when times were tough.  It was a funny and sarcastic read, very enjoyable, but not quite a beach read.  I recommend it if you want a fun ride with funny Irish charachters.    The main charachter's husband leaves her right after she gave birth to their daughter.  She moves back to her parent's house, and starts living with her crazy and disfunctional family.  Throughout couple of months, she learns how to deal with the new status as a mother, copes with her \\"watermelon\\" shape and weight, and finds love in her hectic and screwed up (in a good way of sorts) life.	2005-01-18

I can't even begin to tell you how much I LOVE the series!  The author does an amazing job too!  I laughed so much, I never read a funnier book.  The story is great, the charachters are sexy, and I got 3 of my friends hooked on the series.  Its just something you have to try, if you like it, you'll be hooked, and if not, then you're missing out on a lot!	2005-01-18

I think janet didn't work as hard on this book as she could of.  We got to understand the charachters a little more, and it was still a plum book, but there was something missing. The plot wasn't really there, and the dialouge wasn't really interesting, and ranger was missing for most of the book. Grr! that got me frusturated. Since im a hard core fan, i still liked this book, with all the ranger/stephanie momnets, and it stilll had some (not a lot) giggle laughs.	2004-06-27

The story is told in such a fresh new way.  It's actually a long book, and almost every page is interesting, and you read until the end, and you can't stop!  This book is about a girl named Briseis and is narrated by her.  She tells about her life, her brothers, parents, and the love.  She had a husband, but her heart was won by Achilles.  Its just a splendid historical fiction that i think everyone should be given a change to enjoy this book.  I hope this author writes more books!	2004-06-08

This book was ok, kind of Christmassy for the holidays, but it's not the best, and doesn't fit in with the series.<br /><br />But the truth is, I just pretend it is not part of the series because it had a slight supernatural edge to it.  And common! What is the author thinking?  This is Stephanie Plum, the bounty hunter, why in the world would there be magic, in this fictional real world?  Also, Ranger, one of the hotties, and main characters of the series was out of town, and wasn't in the book at all.  Now, what kind of PLUM book is without Ranger?  Definitely not my favorite.	2004-03-31

But good thing she at least sees that there are things worth lowering your standards for.	2003-12-17
