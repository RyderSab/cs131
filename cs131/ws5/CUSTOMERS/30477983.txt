Next to Alex Haley's Queen, this is the best IR love story I have ever read.  Haley's was more historical and biographical, and The Color of Love, as far as I know, is just fiction. Both I read in one night.   <br /> <br />This book is AWESOME!!!  And I really mean that. I thought the story had a natural build.  Apprehension, getting to know each other as friends, and then the progression to lovers.  I had to chuckle at their first love scene coming on page 204 b/c any other author would have had them sleep together by page 89.   <br /> <br />Anyway, the only gripe about the book for me is how Leah handled her sister...and her sister, Gail, never really apologized for her betrayal. And I thought some of the B/W drama was a bit over the top, but I think Ms. Kitt brought it full circle in a believable way! <br /> <br /> <br />Sandra Kitt ROCKS and I will be checking out more of her stories!	2005-08-03

At the present time I am being forced to read this book in my Honors Seminar class, and for the life of me, I cannot find why I should enjoy this book as much as my professor does.  This book is incredibly boring.  My eyelids are heavy and if I did not have a paper to write on this thing, I would throw it to the bottom of my bed (never to open it again) and go to sleep.   <br /> <br />For me, this book reads like a transcribed tape.  Of course it has an editor, but I really feel like I'm listening to this man talk---which is not always a bad thing. Some [read: better and more interesting] books work well that way, but not this one.  This book has me wondering, \\"why do I care about this?\\" and \\"who are these people?\\" These questions signal that it is very easy for a reader to get lost in the jumble.  <br /> <br />Wow, just writing a REVIEW of this book is making me sleepier. Read this if you must.  If you have some burning desire to learn more about Russell Simmons, then enjoy.	2005-03-14

I will say that this book kept me interested til the very end.  I do not think anything that happened was far-fetched.  I'm not one who enjoys books that are overly-sexual, so that was a drawback for me.  Especially since a lot of the sex was loose and very irresponsible.  That being said, I think the book (storywise) was interesting and I enjoyed the round up of the characters at the end.      My only gripe is with the character Johnny and how his story wraps up nicely at the end. It just tickles me because it reminded me that if you write a novel, you can have it end anyway you please, LOL.  Read the book and you'll find out.	2004-12-10

I hate buying a book that I don't want to keep.  However, this book left a lot to be desired.  I had just finished reading two books that had me enthralled, so I thought I was on a streak.  Read this...streak ended.  There was just way too much unexplained stuff going on in the book.  For me, the characters had no real depth.  Relationships formed (aside from Kristen and Rafe) that just seemed all to convenient.   <br /> <br />I also agree with the reviewers who claimed the book was too long.  It really was.  And I don't even feel like I rushed through the book.  Several times, I went back and reread parts just to make sure I got them.   <br /> <br />Nice try, Mrs. Ray, but no.

Suffice it to say, Amazon has taken a stance that is extremely bogus and after I receive a book I ordered (before reading this hypocitical policy) I will be terminating my Amazon account.  I shall not make a seller suffer b/c of the owner of this site. Amazon should be ashamed b/c it is clear that many are giving the book a 5 to assist in countering the 1 star reviews.  This should not be allowed b/c it gives a contrived \\"average review\\" of the book in question. It is WAY too easy to post anything on this site.  This book should have NOT been singled out.

FIlled with stereotypes that blacks cannot seem to let go of.  I am black, and this book was embarassing.  The way the black characters feel is this book gives the idea that anything black is good for you...and EVERYTHING white is EVIL.  Well newsflash:  Not every white person is out to get you and not every black person has your best interest at heart!  People who view the world this way are doomed to shut doors for themselves that would otherwise be open. IMO, no one looks at race more than African Americans and that to me, a young black woman, is incredibly disturbing. <br />I must say I was turned off by the author's way of writing both Lee and Porter...Lee began as very condescending...as did her friends.  I am all for black pride, but blind racial loyalties are dangerous.  <br />The end of the book was very predictable.  The big climax or whatever you want to call it was so predictable.  To have someone like Porter, who seemingly based how he treated people on their individual qualities, do what he did (two separate incidents) was nothing more than a copout and some sort of justification for the author's viewpoint. I did not find this book enjoyable at all.<br />Save yourself the trouble.	2004-07-10

I had never heard of the author, but I do enjoy reading books by new authors.  Resurrecting Mingus was a complete letdown.  Like others have said, loose ends ruined this book for me.  The way she hooked up with that guy was too bogus for me...seemed like the author just wanted her to end up with a black man.  I didn't see how he was better for her than the white officer.  I actually was hoping that something would come out of that moreso than with the black guy.  <br />I just finished reading this book two days ago, but it is easily forgettable.

One of my friends told me about this book, so I went out and purchased it.  The premise of the book had me intrigued, but the pacing and structure is making it difficult to read.  Several times, I've found myself picking up other books and being able to finish them, while fighting to get through a couple of pages of this one.      I applaud the author for trying out a different genre, but he dropped the ball on this one. It's not exactly a \\"page turner.\\"      FINALLY MADE IT THROUGH THIS BOOK....AFTER TWO YRS!!!, August 18, 2005  Reviewer: Lynnie \\"Lynnie\\" (Bowie, MD) - See all my reviews   It took me two years to finish this book. I had to get the audio ABRIDGED cds to help with this process. I heard that it was on the best seller list. Could not get into it, and I really REALLY tried. It is so obvious that Mr. Carter is a nonfiction writer and a law professor. There are too many words an details in this book. You can write a great story without it being so overdone. I totally agree with everyone who discussed the editor or lack thereof. This book was way too long. The characters were vapid and quite possibly the most unsympathetic ones I've ever read about. Too many things going on in this one.      I bought the cds (which I am promptly selling) to help me get through it and that was still a struggle!

Where's the rest of the book?  It ended so abruptly. Where's the logic behind the actions of these people?      As you can see, I did not enjoy this book.  Connie Briscoe truly dropped the ball with this one.  The only reason I had for reading it was that I reside in PG County. Have for my entire 22 years. I found the characters in this book to be horrible representations of the people here.  Yes, I know, it's a book meant for entertainment, but come on!  I've noticed that a few reviewers live in the County with me, so I know I do not have this opinion on my own.    1.Every single woman in this book had serious self-esteem issues: 1)Barbara--staying with a man that cheated on her repeatedly, 2)Jolene--money grubber...adulterer...skank, shall I go on?  Cheated on her husband with 2 men (1 was Barb's hub) and felt that a man was only worth something if he had $$.  What type of example was she setting for her young daughter?  3)Candice--main Caucasian woman in the book.  Disturbed that her daughter, Ashley, whom she has encouraged to accept people regardless of race, status, etc, is dating a black man.  4)Pearl--disturbed that her son is dating the said white daughter.  By far, the most racist person in the book as far as I was concerned.  5)Lee--some random character that popped up every five chapters or more.  Added nothing to the book except for a overly dramatic ending.      This book did nothing for me. Pearl and Candice's resistance to their children dating was ridiculous.  Somehow though, when Candice found out she was black (according to the ridiculous 1 drop rule), their relationship is all of a sudden something that is accepted!  And what was the purpose of pointing that out to Lee? No sense at all.  Lee's popping up added ZIP, NIL, NADA to the story!    I could write more, but I really don't feel like it.  Do like I did.  Buy this book for no more than $1.50.  Or rent it from the library.	2004-05-26

My favorite is Eddie, followed by Paul, then David, then Dennis.  <br />Let me just say.  The only ones who know everything that went on in the Tempts were the Tempts, yet this book, for me, left a lot to be desired.  This definitely isn't my favorite Motown book.  I agree with those, on Amazon.com and off, who say that this book negatively portrayed David and Eddie. For example, there is a passage that relays a meeting during the Reunion tour.  Apparently the Motown exec in charge of the meeting didn't really care at all for the Tempts at this stage in their career...but you wouldn't have known that until AFTER you read about David and Eddie seemingly flying off the handle for no apparent reason.  It appeared as if all the author could recall was David and Eddie's \\"fits of anger,\\" and couldn't remember what set them off.  Yeah, sure...  I took it as, the author (either Otis or Romanowski) wanted to paint Eddie and David as spoiled stars. There were too many holes in the passage for me to think otherwise.  And then a couple of sentences later, he looks back, and says he wishes that he had joined Eddie and David. Could this mean that they weren't the egotists that they are painted to be?  Hmm???<br />Before I close, I want to comment on the updated chapter.  I wonder if Otis realized what he said.  In the updated chapter, he implies-actually he basically states--that now that the others are gone, he can say what he wants.  He states that in '88, he held stuff back. Is there really more than one way to interpret this???  He talks about how weak Eddie's voice was during the Reunion show...yet in the first addition, he says that \\"Eddie did his job beautifully.\\"  Which is it, Mr. Williams??? Similar statements are made about David.  My thing is this, what's the point in bringing it up over ten years after they died?? Who is it helping to hear you backtrack some information?  Also, reading that made me wonder about the part he tellsabout the last time he spoke with Eddie (before his passing). Only Otis, Eddie, and God know if that really went down, but I do have to question his bashing of Eddie's voice in 2002 and then writing about his last communication w/him.  <br />I give it three stars---mainly for the pictures.  I don't particularly care for this book.  I take issue w/plenty of it.  I don't know anymore than most, but there are some things that do not seem to jive with me.  <br />Oh, and I think it's about time that we acknowledge that the Temptations were a merging of two groups: the Primes and the Distants.  It wasn't the dream of one man...but of five.  Especially given the vocal talent of the said one man.  Eddie (\\"he brought a half, and I brought a half\\"--Eddie himself said this phrase) considered it a merger and that is much more gracious and giving than one man, sole founder/creator of the group.<br />Like I said, the pics are good. Except for one.  Given the impression of a certain original Tempt given in the book (and the movie for that matter), they really could have found a better shot.  I'm sure Big O had better pictures.  Read the book and you'll see which one I mean. <br />Read it to see a original Tempt's view...but DEFINITELY don't take it as gospel.	2003-08-05

It was nice to see the Cinderella story of the Primettes turned Supremes although I am not a huge fan of girl groups.  I enjoyed Dreamgirls way more than the second book though.  <br />I liked that she mentioned her humongous crush on my favorite Temptation, Eddie James.  Also that he was one of the first people to visit Flo when she fell on hard times.  It's nice to have others say nice things after you when you are long gone<br />Now about Flo, that was such a sad situation.  I can only imagine what it was like for her to bring Diana into the group and slowly watch her push herself to the front---and then have BG push her along. I applaud her for standing up to them, but I am sorry that it didn't work in her favor.  It seemed like Mary was too passive in the situation though.  If she and Flo had stood up to BG, things might have been different.  Flo had so many fans.  the parts about her are incredibly sad.  <br />People say that Flo died of a heart attack as well as a broken heart and I am really inclined to agree.  <br />All in all, a good book.  I recommend this one.	2003-06-27

This book was just a rehash of what we already know from the various stars' memoirs.  A lot of what he took was from Berry's book.  He did reveal some things about Motown's business practices that were eye-openers.  He also talks about what happened to flow and that whole situation was a crying shame. I found the parts about Hollywood Motown to be interesting.  The failure of some of their movies just proves the point that everybody can't do everything.  <br />I did read this book, start to finish, in two days though.	2003-06-19
US	30477983	R2HBJJUGZ69U2J	1560250348	808910916	Deliver Us from Temptation	Books	2	27	32	N	N	Got some questions for Mr. Turner!!	I have read this book one time, but I'm reading it again to see if I missed something.  I'm not really sure how to take this book.  I will say this though, it's a quick read. I know as with all books about other people, you can't really believe everything, but somethings I HAVE to mention and question.<br />1)If he was 12 when he started travelling w/Motown, why would his mother let him travel with all these grown folk? I'm confused by this. From what I've read, it's not like he had any type of family connection to any of them or anything. And he was definitely not in the same boat as Stevie. I don't think I would have let my kid travel w/these adults (who were still very young themselves) and really trust them to watch out for him. Nope. <br />2)I'm not understanding why his choice of lifestyle has to color the pages of the book. I wonder if it is really necessary. As far as I can see, it doesn't add to the book. IMO. And some of the suggestions he's making do not sit well with me. I just have to ask why.<br />3)I haven't read anywhere HOW he ended up managing Mary first, and then ending up w/the guys. In Mary's books, she only mentions him once, total. Unless I skipped over, but I'm positive I didn't. And what she said about him wasn't even significant or anything. And the same w/the guys. I haven't read where he said how he ended up managing them or whatever it was he did. <br />4)And finally, for now anyways, for all the traveling that he did with the guys, there aren't any pictures in the book w/him and the guys. There is one w/him and Den, but not w/Eddie and David. And a lot of the pics of the guys are someone else's pictures. I'm curious about this.<br />5)In the book, he mentions about when David was replaced. He says that the Tempts were sneaking Dennis in and he gives the impression that David didn't even know Dennis. But if you let Dennis tell it, see the Street Gold tape, David and Dennis talked about it before he got the call. So, I can't help but wonder how close to certain situations Turner really was. Of course he wasn't privy to this particular incident, but this is completely different from what Dennis said.<br />A lot of his book reads as gossip, and truthfully, there are only so many times I could hear him call himself \\"Diva\\" and other such names, and hear others call him \\"Baby and the b-word\\" before I quit taking him seriously.  It was definitely a bit much.  <br />Also, unlike Martha Reeves or Mary Wilson, I am not understanding why he feels the need to grind an ax.  He wasn't burned or anything by Motown, so most of what he says about others (i.e. Diana Ross) is from hearsay or what he's been told.  I mean, really, Mary can attest to Diana's actions because it happened to her!  Not this guy!<br />I don't feel like he honored the memories of the great Eddie Kendrick (my favorite), David Ruffin, or even the still living Dennis Edwards.  In the preface, he mentions how they told him to keep the family secrets secrets.( it's in there).  So I'm inclined to believe that this was more for personal gain than anything else.<br />I've read better books, and the main thing that this one has going for it is that it's a quick read.  Pick it up from your local library, and DON'T U DARE pay ... for a used one!!	2003-06-16

I enjoyed Dancing in the Streets more than I did Mary Wilson's books.  Now we all know that all of the spurned Motown artist feel burned and are out to get what's owed them, but in reading this book, I did not feel like that was the driving force behind its conception.  Martha tells it like it is!  I commend her for this effort!  I hope she writes another one!!<br />I highly recommend this one!	2003-06-16
