US	53038410	R39Q4YQTAZ52IE	0465046754	692787574	The Republican War on Science	Books	5	42	54	N	N	A "must read" for anyone concerned about science in America	This is a well-researched, easy-to-read book that's highly informative, timely and speaks powerfully to major issues facing society today. <br /> <br />Mooney is a journalist who has spent years covering issues related to science, especially areas where science plays a large part in modern society.  He clearly knows what science is, and nicely explains how science isn't simply a collection of data, but a way of explaining things and placing the data within the larger context of tested theories that provide added insight into how the world works.  <br /> <br />The war on science is, naturally enough, a war on the method of science and the institutions used to advance scientific knowledge.  Mooney begins his book by describing the republican war on science from an historical background.  The party hasn't always been anti-science.  Many early members of the party (even Richard Nixon) were actually moderates on the subject, and showed a certain deference to science, even when it didn't fit the party line. <br /> <br />The republican war on science began in earnest with the marriage of two key groups; business and conservative Christians (including fringe groups like the Mormons).  This marriage resulted in the perfect political storm because business groups had/have plenty of money with which to corrupt the political process, while Christian groups are willing to barter economic, health, and environmental issues in return for the right to use the government as a vehicle for imposing their religious ideology on American society.   <br /> <br />Some of the techniques used by republicans in their war on science include: <br /> <br />1)  Over emphasize scientific uncertainty, creating the illusion of a controversy where none exists within the scientific community <br />2)  Demand \\"peer review\\" by industry-friendly scientists who have a financial links with their political sponsors <br />3)  Eliminate non-partisan sources for scientific advice to Congress.  Replace them witha process beholden to politics and business interests (politicizing science) <br />4)  Give the illusion of supporting science (while simultaneously degrading it) by using propaganda with phrases like \\"sound science,\\" \\"junk science,\\" etc.   <br />5)  Establish \\"think tanks\\" staffed by cherry-picked industry-friendly scientists.  Demand that these think tanks have equal time with non-partisan scientific institutions. <br /> <br />The propaganda component caught my eye, harkening back to my youth as a devout Mormon where I was taught that there will never be a conflict between \\"true religion\\" and \\"true science.\\"  I was assured that any disagreements between science and Mormonism (like evolution and the origin of the ancient Americans) could happen only with \\"junk science,\\" or the \\"wisdom of men,\\" because (by definition) \\"true science\\" never disagrees with \\"the gospel.\\"   <br /> <br />With GOP propaganda sound bites like \\"sound science,\\" I immediately suspected a Mormon connection.  Sure enough, I found that Chris Cannon, leader of the \\"Sound Science Caucus\\" in the House, and representative from Utah, is a BYU-educated and highly regarded member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). <br /> <br />Most alarmingly, the Republican war on science is often linked to issues that have the capacity to greatly impact public health and the environment.  A few examples touched by Mooney include: <br /> <br />1)  Global warming <br />2)  Salmon extinction/recovery <br />3)  Depletion of the ozone layer <br />4)  Teaching religion (creationism/Intelligent design) in science classes <br />5)  Limiting access to, and misrepresenting the science of, reproductive science <br />6)  Acid rain <br />7)  Mercury poison in the environment <br />8)  Risks from carcinogens such as smoking and asbestos. <br />9)  Star wars   <br /> <br />Recent examples of heightened hurricane strength (predicted by global warming models) are just a small taste of the future cost the world will pay as a result of the GOP war on the science of earth's climate.  <br /> <br />Mooney points out that it's not just Republicans who are abusing science.  Democrats and liberals are guilty, too.  The difference is in degree and tenacity, where the GOP wins, hands down.  Still, I think Mooney should have been a bit tougher on liberals.  Their ideologically driven opposition to nuclear energy certainly has exacerbated the problem with global warming.  And the recent falloff in gas-guzzling SUVs, as the price of gasoline has risen, illustrates the absurdity of some liberals who insist on mandating mileage standards to the exclusion of using higher energy taxes to encourage conservation by making energy more expensive. <br /> <br />At its root the war on science involves intellectual dishonesty and distain for scientific evidence.  Because of this, I was a little surprised that Mooney didn't delve into the obvious repercussions that reach beyond issues strictly related to science.  For example, intellectual dishonesty, distain for evidence, and ideology were essential tools used by the Bush administration in unilaterally misleading the nation to war in Iraq.     <br /> <br />Another shortcoming in Mooney's book is that he doesn't give enough time to the issue of game theory.   Science and policy always meet at an interface, and Mooney too often gives the impression that science doesn't give guidance on how to establish wise policy using scientific evidence.  Mathematicians, though, developed the tools to do it, in the branch of mathematics called game theory.  If politicians were better versed in how to logically weigh evidence and uncertainty, it would go a long way toward mitigating the damage that's being done by the ideologues currently running the government.  <br /> <br />The issue of global warming is a good example because the consequences are immense, far exceeding the economic cost of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases sufficient to stabilizethe climate.  Republicans, though, (led by George W. Bush) argue that we shouldn't take action because there is uncertainty about global warming. When in fact, using the mathematics of game theory, we see that it's precisely *because* of uncertainty that we must act at once.  With so much at stake, we dare not gamble with earth's future.   <br /> <br />With issues like the threatened bird flu pandemic, global warming and energy shortages facing the nation, we simply cannot afford to be led by religious ideologues bent on abusing science for political/religious purposes.  For citizens who care about America's future, and the world, this is a book you simply can't afford not to read. <br />	2005-10-10
US	53038410	R3PS3ZY31JLMA	0452284570	345670700	Entanglement	Books	5	37	39	N	N	The universe really is weird.	This is one of the best books I've read this year.  It's easy to read, highly informative, accurate and fun.  Aczel has done a masterful job of combining a book on scientific history with an introductory tomb explaining one of the especially non-intuitive aspects of the quantum world - the entanglement of multiple quantum particles.<br /><br />Entanglement as a consequence of quantum mechanics was actually predicted by Einstein and used in a thought experiment to try and discredit the new theory.  Einstein believed in strict determinism and considered quantum mechanics to be incomplete.  He had a lifelong friendship and debate with Bohr, who was one of the founders of quantum theory.  Einstein, along with Podolsky and Rosen developed a \\"thought experiment\\" in which the outcome was so weird - if quantum physics was correct - that it simply couldn't be accepted (by Einstein, anyway).  Einstein considered this weird outcome in quantum mechanics to essentially prove that it was incomplete.<br /><br />In Einstein's thought experiment he imagined two entangled quantum particles whose quantum properties were dependent upon each other.  For example, the particles could be photons produced by a reaction that starts out with zero spin.  Since spin is conserved, and photons have integral spin, if one photon has spin +1 the other must have spin -1.<br /><br />Quantum mechanics says that, until the particles are measured, their spins are in a superposition of states, and when one photon's spin is measured, the other photon instantly assumes the opposite spin - no matter how far apart the two are.  Indeed, before they are measured, quantum mechanics doesn't treat the two photons as distinctly different particles at all.  Before the measurement (before collapse of the wave function) they are a superposition - something for which there is no classical analog.<br /><br />Quantum mechanics is thus non-local, and Einstein thought the result of this thought experiment, weird as it is, left no other option but to conclude that quantum mechanics is incomplete.  The thought experiment proposed by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen was a serious challenge to Bohr and other scientists who subscribed to the Copenhagen view on quantum mechanics.<br /><br />Years passed after Einstein proposed this experiment, and it remained technically out of reach.  Later, the idea was refined by John Bell who showed that the central logical question in the EPR experiment can be reduced to an inequality that can be measured in actual experiments.<br /><br />This is the story of how scientists built upon Einstein's initial idea of entanglement and used Bell's ideas to construct practical experiments to test one of the strangest ideas in quantum mechanics.<br /><br />Einstein thought the non-local and fundamentally unpredictable nature of quantum mechanics was too weird to be true, but when scientists finally managed to test entangled particles, they found that they really do behave just as quantum physics said they would.  Quantum mechanics really *is* weird, but only because it describes the universe, and the universe is weird.<br /><br />This is a nice little book that does a good job of weaving the history with the science.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and highly recommend it.it is, left no other option but to conclude that quantum mechanics is incomplete.

US	53038410	R1X8JZMJSBNPSO	0198607830	815493498	Oxygen: The Molecule that Made the World (Popular Science)	Books	5	43	45	N	N	The poison we can't live without	For a relatively short book, Lane's story about oxygen covers an amazing scope that cuts across huge swaths of science including geology, paleontology, anthropology, biology, geo-physics, evolution, and medicine.  Although Oxygen is fascinating for the story it tells of earth's evolution, it's also contemporary in the way it deals with one of the oldest questions faced by humankind - how and why we age and die. <br /> <br />Most people know that the oxygen in our atmosphere comes from plants, and that we need oxygen to live.  Recent science news has also spread the word that oxygen has a darker side because it causes cell damage and oxidative stress.  Purveyors of health foods explain the value of things like green tea in terms of their anti-oxidants and their supposed ability to neutralize the harsh effects of oxygen on human bodies.  But there's a mystery here; if oxygen is so toxic, why did so many life forms evolve to depend on it?  Though an apparent mystery, this subject is the topic of intense research which is beginning to explain this particular tale of evolution.    <br /> <br />This is one of the better books I've read in the last year.  For the most part it is relatively easy to read, though there are times when the book is hard to follow.  For me, some passages required reading over and over again before I could confidently say that I understood what the author was saying.  In a few cases, though, I was never clear and finally had to simply guess.   <br /> <br />Whenever I checked the books accuracy I found it to be generally correct, though there are a few places that stumped me.  For example, on page 65 Lane says: <br /> <br />When ionized, a single atom of organic carbon gives up as many as four electrons to form carbon dioxide.  A single atom of organic carbon therefore consumes four times as much oxygen from the air as does a single atom of iron. <br /> <br />This looks like a mistake.  Carbon dioxide, of course, consists of a single atom of carbonand two of oxygen.  Iron (III) oxide (also called ferric oxide, red iron oxide, synthetic maghemite, rouge,or rust) has chemical formula Fe2O3.  Based on these chemical formulas, a single atom of carbon consumes 2 atoms of oxygen while 2 atoms of iron consume 3 atoms of oxygen.  Thus a single atom of carbon consumes 1.33 times as much oxygen as a single atom of iron; not 4.  In the case of magnetite, Fe3O4, the ratio is 1.5:1.    <br /> <br />According to Lane, \\"ageing and age-related diseases are degenerative conditions brought about by the combination of mitochondrial leakage, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation.\\" [Page 310].   This position is likely to be non-controversial (or only slightly controversial) with other researchers.  That being the case, how did life (or, at least the macroscopic animal life that we are mostly familiar with) come to be so dependent on oxygen in the first place?    <br /> <br />The author argues that life was exposed to oxidative stress long before there was any free molecular oxygen in the atmosphere.  Because there was no free oxygen in the atmosphere, there was also no ozone, and the lack of ozone meant high UV radiance at earth's surface.  This ultraviolet radiation split water molecules to produce hydroxyl radicals, super oxide radicals and hydrogen peroxide.   <br /> <br />According to Lane, the earliest life on earth adapted to the environment at the ocean's surface, and evolved antioxidant enzymes for protection against the radiation-produced reactive oxygen intermediates.  He supports this conclusion with a great deal of scientific data, including genetic studies that suggest the latest common ancestor to all life on earth had antioxidant enzymes, including SOD, catalase, and peroxiredoxins.   <br /> <br />According to the story told by Oxygen, shortly after the early meteorite bombardment that created the moon and earth, 3.85 billion years ago, life had evolved the ability to generate energy from oxygen respiration and was already resistant to oxidative stress, even though no free oxygen had yet accumulated in the atmosphere.  Later, as photosynthetic cyanobacteria evolved, they spewed oxygen into the air.  This prevented additional radiative dissociation, and loss, of the water in earth's oceans.  Venus, in contrast, lost it's oceans through a runaway greenhouse effect.  <br /> <br />Midway through the book Lane takes what appears to be a side trip into the (apparently) unrelated topic of radiation poisoning.  This chapter is very interesting in its own right, but I thought the author had forgotten the title of his book.  Imagine my surprise when Lane tied it all together by explaining how the damage caused by radiation is chemically the same as that caused by oxidation.  It was one of the more innovative twists and reconnects I've seen in a science book. <br /> <br />The scope of subjects touched by Lane's book is impressive.  In addition to nicely telling earth's geological and biological history, the book also includes such interesting discussions/explanations as the origin of sex and aging, and how oxygen played a role in each case.  Throughout the book there are mini tutorials.  One such tutorial describes untangling the history of evolution by looking at variations in the genetic code, and how such techniques are becoming more sophisticated and accurate, and subsequently used as powerful tools in unraveling the history of life on earth.  Another tutorial briefly covers the science of using the ratios of different isotopes of carbon to estimate the amount of biological activity during the earth's past.   <br /> <br />In telling the story of oxygen, Lane has crafted a masterpiece that takes the reader on a journey of discovery, touching far-ranging subjects and leaving a pleasing sense of world view that ties together seemingly disparate subjects into an unanticipated whole.  I highly recommend this book.  <br />	2005-09-29
US	53038410	R2XLOK7ESIM2EZ	0976339404	210579943	Consciousness and the Probability of Being: The Origin of the Particular "I"	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Philosophy with a bit of science	Ask two scientists (even specialists in the field) to define what they mean by consciousness, and you're likely to get two different answers.  Ask them to describe how to measure consciousness and the responses are likely to be even more disparate.   Because of this muddled situation, I think authors who write about it should first provide a clear and non-ambiguous definition of what they mean by \\"consciousness.\\"  To his credit, Wright does make the effort, but fails (like all other authors I know) to give a scientifically testable definition.    <br /> <br />Because of the uncertainty, consciousness is a field rife with philosophical speculation.  Philosophers, no doubt, think highly of their opinions, but philosophy is fundamentally distinct from science because it doesn't rely upon the scientific testing of hypotheses.  Wright's book references philosophical opinion heavily.  <br /> <br />As with other authors, Wright seems to take the opinion that consciousness and self awareness are primarily human characteristics.   However, as evolved characteristics, consciousness and self awareness, like my backbone and femur, are likely to differ from other animals only in degree, and not in some absolute or fundamental way.   <br /> <br />In reading this book I found myself alternately agreeing and then disagreeing with the author.  For example, on page 74 he says that our first-person view doesn't arise deterministically from our genes.  That's almost certainly true since environmental influences have undeniable effects on how the brain is wired.  But just a paragraph later the author claims that genes have \\"nothing whatsoever to do with\\" the development of the specific \\"you\\" in your brain.   That assertion is quite flabbergasting, given his materialistic point of view.  Wright rejects the notion that my unique consciousness owes its existence to any specific physical pattern in my brain.  For example, the author says: <br /> <br />\\"Even if the neural wiring of all brains were minutely identical down to the synapse, we must still conclude that the distribution of subjective directions would be unaffected.  \\"You\\" would still be here (or not); someone else would still not be here (or would be).  [p. 188] <br /> <br />Wright echoes this reasoning throughout his book, but the argument is based on a false premise because our brains are modified by sensory input and so two brains in different locations (subject, necessarily, to different sensory input) cannot be \\"wired\\" exactly the same.  Instead, they will be differentially modified by different sensory input (sight, sound, etc.).  Furthermore, their quantum states must necessarily be different.   <br /> <br />A typical thought experiment used by Wright may be found on page 116, where he says: <br /> <br />\\"Hypothesize that future machines can scan your body from head to toe, atom by atom, molecule by molecule, and store the atomic and molecular configuration for each cubic millimeter of you on magnetic tape for later access...[now along comes a scientist who] invents a second machine that can accept this first tape as input.  Atom by atom, molecule by molecule, this machine can create as output another individual similar to you in all respects, including every conditioned and unconditioned synapse of your brain.\\"  <br /> <br />Those familiar with quantum physics will recall William Wootters and W. Zurek who proved, in the 1980s, that a quantum particle can never be \\"cloned.\\"  Their theorem says that the process of transferring the full quantum state from one quantum particle to another always ends up changing the original.  It is impossible (not just technically improbable) to copy the full quantum information from one particle to another, resulting in two exact duplicates.  Wright's argument is thus based on at least one of two dubious assumptions; that it's possible to violate quantum physics, or that consciousness in no way depends on the quantum state of the material in the brain.<br /> <br />Wright also takes the point of view that there are essential elements of \\"you\\" and \\"I\\" that are invariant over time.  I find philosophical arguments frequently stumble over the concept of existence.  This misconception is illustrated nicely by the following statement from Wright's book: <br /> <br />\\"The mathematically inclined may wish to scribble in the margin that subjectivity is being postulated as invariant under genetic rotation.  The constituents of a river, a burning flame, and (we hold) consciousness, can change without the river becoming another river or the flame becoming another flame or the consciousness switching to another first-person view.\\"  [p. 61-62] <br /> <br />The Native Americans had a better grasp on the nature of existence when they observed that it's impossible to step into the same river twice.  In other words, the persistence of the river is nothing more than an illusion, made possible by an apparently seamless path of evolution from one moment to the next.  The turbulence in the river never repeats, the plants along the edge of the bank change, and even the river bed can move.  Given enough time the river can go dry, become covered with kilometers of sediment, and fossilized.  The river not only can become another river, it is continually becoming another river. <br /> <br />When we look at the extremes it's easier to see the changes and sometimes we admit that the changes are enough to destroy the old river and create a new one.  But such thresholds are arbitrary.  In fact, the river is never static, and always changing - continually reborn.  In my opinion, it's much the same with consciousness, though Wright specifically disavows this point of view.   <br /> <br />This was a difficult book to read and, I'm sure, to write.   I give Wright credit for making a good stab at it.  He certainly has done a nice job of summarizing the opinions of philosophers on the subject of consciousness.  While I agree with some of his points,I think he's failed to establish his core thesis.  Regardless, though, I recommend the book to people who like to think, and like to think about how they think. <br />	2005-09-29

It's quite interesting and encompasses a lot of mathematics and philosophy as well as a bit of physics.   <br /> <br />Although the book reads well, is nicely documented, and extensively researched, the author has a style that I found aggravating; his frequent use of poetic hyperbole.  This limits the book's value for someone unfamiliar with basic concepts in mathematics and physics.  <br /> <br />I'm not sure why Seife choose this style.  There seems to be a movement (hopefully short lived) among science writers to dress up science and mathematics in poetic, flowery language.  Whatever the reason, science has good reason to use strict meanings for words and a disciplined approach to scientific concepts.  When authors poetically use words in technically incorrect ways they can make the prose pretty, but they often create confusion. <br /> <br />For example, Saif says \\"Zero and infinity are eternally locked in a struggle to engulf all the numbers.  Like a Manichaean nightmare, the two sit on opposite poles of the number sphere, sucking numbers in like tiny black holes.\\" [p. 145] <br /> <br />From a mathematical point of view this is pure gibberish.  If one's intent is to educate others about mathematics, such poetic hyperbole is not only useless, but counter productive as well.  For folks who don't already know a bit about mathematics, Seife's book is as likely to confuse as to educate.  For those who already understand the concepts, the poetry might be pleasing, but from an educational point of view the hyperbole found throughout this book is a definite stumbling block. <br /> <br />Another problem I had with this book is the way Seife misstates some key aspects in modern science.  For example, on page 171 he asserts the classical definition of a vacuum: \\"The vacuum, by definition, has nothing in it - no particles, no light, nothing.\\"  He then describes the quantum mechanical view of thevacuum, and the zero-point energy.  Part of this explanation includes a nice description of the Casimir effect [p. 172], which is a measurement of the literal existence of the \\"virtual\\" particles predicted by Quantum Mechanics.  What these experiments show is that these \\"virtual\\" particles actually exist, and can be detected by the force they exert on closely spaced metal plates.  This is actually a beautiful example of how science changed our concept of the vacuum.  Classically, we thought of the vacuum as having \\"nothing in it,\\" but Quantum Mechanics tells us that the classical vacuum cannot exist.  But even after his nice explanation of the Casimir effect, Seife goes and spoils it with this absurd statement: <br /> <br />\\"Casimir realized that he had felt the force of nothing.\\" [p. 172] \\"This is the force of the vacuum, a force produced by nothing at all.  This is the Casimir effect.\\" <br /> <br />It's as if someone asserted that the space around us has \\"nothing in it,\\" and then rejoices when the wind touches his face, and runs off spouting \\"I've felt the force of nothing.\\"  What the Casimir effect teaches us is that what we thought was \\"nothing at all\\" really is something, and that calling them \\"virtual\\" particles is just as silly as early mathematicians who called the square root of negative numbers \\"imaginary.\\"   <br /> <br />There are other mistakes as well.  For example, on page 178 he says: \\"The speed of light is the ultimate speed limit; you cannot reach it, much less exceed it.  Nature has defended itself from an unruly zero.\\"   <br /> <br />But this simply isn't true.  Even a casual reader knows that the statement \\"you cannot reach it\\" is wrong.  After all, photons travel at the speed of light all the time.  Furthermore, scientists have known for years that, given the right materials, both the phase velocity and the group velocity of light can exceed the speed of light in a vacuum [Optics and Photonics News, June 2002].  All this is consistent within the framework of relativity, but Seife's hyperbole is likely to mislead the novice.  Indeed, recent experiments showing these phenomena have resulted in all sorts of pundits on the Internet claiming that relativity had been falsified.   <br /> <br />By getting all wound up with poetic hyperbole about nature \\"[defending] itself from an unruly zero\\" the author has, I fear, unwittingly contributed to the confusion of non-scientists about the science of relativity. <br /> <br />I don't mean to give the impression that this is a bad book.  I actually found most of it readable and pleasant.  I enjoyed the historical aspects and appreciated how the author illustrates the influence of philosophy, and especially religion, in either advancing or retarding cultural acceptance of the concept of zero.  I thought he did a particularly nice job of explaining the development of the calculus, and how the concept of zero played its part.  As usual, the primary distractions were related to his use of poetic hyperbole, as well as careless analogies.  For example, on page 126 he writes: <br /> <br />\\"... using calculus was as much an act of faith as declaring a belief in god.\\" <br /> <br />This absurd statement was almost certainly made without thinking.  After all, even though early mathematicians could not explain why the calculus worked - at least not with rigorous logic - they could demonstrate that it *did* work.  Furthermore, anyone could use it.  A person didn't have to believe in calculus or work themselves into an emotional frenzy to calculate the volume of a sphere.  The same cannot, of course, be said of god. <br /> <br />This could have been a really great book.  The subject matter and story of zero are fascinating.  Unfortunately, Seife uses too many analogies that are either poor, extreme, or misleading.  And his persistent tendency toward exaggeration was a real distraction for me.  For these reasons I'd not recommend the book to someone not already somewhat knowledgeable about mathematics and physics - I think it would be too confusing.  For those who can read between the lines of poetic hyperbole, though, I think the book is worthwhile.	2005-05-14
US	53038410	R3SID6MJ0T6MKB	0618005838	521873182	The Ancestor's Tale: A Pilgrimage to the Dawn of Evolution	Books	5	37	42	N	N	The story in reverse	It's such a pleasure to read a book like this.  Every time I set it down, I found myself wanting to pick it up again.  It's certainly one of the top ten best books I've read in the last ten years.   <br /> <br />Dawkins is a world-class scientist, thinker, and writer.  He's not only in full command of the science he writes about, he's also a master of language, with a knack for explaining complex phenomena in a way that resonates with critical thinking. <br /> <br />Typically, books about evolution and the history of life on earth begin a long, long time ago, and work their way forward through the ages.  \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\" is a refreshingly different way of looking at evolution on earth.  Dawkins starts in the present and works backward through time, describing the ancestors we'd met along the way, if we really could take such a fanciful journey.  <br /> <br />As an accomplished scientist and unequaled communicator, Dawkins carefully lays the groundwork for lay individuals, who are his likely audience, by explaining key concepts that many people probably feel comfortable with, but really don't understand.  One of these concepts is the idea of an \\"ancestor.\\"  Ask the typical person on the street \\"what is an ancestor?\\" and you are likely to get the genealogical answer; \\"someone to whom you are related in the past, such as a parent, grandparent, etc.\\"  While that may be the commonly accepted definition, it's inadequate for science.  Through the nuances of biological evolution, things get far more interesting.  For example, Dawkins explains the rather remarkable conclusion that a person might not have any of the genes from a genealogical ancestor.  It's entirely possible that you are related to a famous European king through genealogy, yet have not a single one of his genes.    <br /> <br />At first each page of the book covers a relatively small number of years into the past, but as the story progresses the pace accelerates.  Moving into the past, the reader encounters a rendezvous each time the ancestors from a different group join the progression.  Along the human line the first rendezvous is with the ancestors of chimpanzees, about 6 million years ago.  The next rendezvous is about 7 million years ago when the ancestors of the gorillas join in.  All together there are 39 rendezvous, taking the reader over a thousand million years into the past.   <br /> <br />Part of the genius of this book is the way Dawkins tells such interesting stories while intertwining useful and fascinating facts, concepts, and precepts about evolution and the history of life on earth.  Indeed, this is primarily a book about evolution, but presented through story telling as each ancestor (and a few extras) recount their \\"tale,\\" and in the process illustrate some peculiarity of the evolution of life on earth.  These lessons span the range from initial concepts about what makes an ancestor, to concepts like convergent evolution, dating techniques, the interrelationship between species, etc. <br /> <br />This is a relatively long book, and given the amount of material found between its covers you'd expect more mistakes than there are.  One of the doozies is a guffaw near the end, on page 613, where Dawkins says:  <br /> <br />\\"The universe could easily have remained lifeless and simple - just physics and chemistry...\\"  <br /> <br />Dawkins' use of the word \\"just\\" is unfortunate because it implies that life is somehow less remarkable unless we drift into the world of superstition by imagining that life needs to be more than physics and chemistry.  The thing that makes life remarkable (and I'm sure Dawkins would agree with this) is that it is \\"just\\" physics and chemistry.  Indeed, Dawkins says it best in the very next paragraph:  <br /> <br />\\"If it's amazement you want, the real world has it all.\\"   <br /> <br />Yes, life is amazing, and it's all the more amazing because it is \\"just\\" physics and chemistry and because we can therefore hope to eventually understand and comprehend it. <br /> <br />In another instance, Dawkins tries to explain why animals don't build roads (in contrast with people, who can't seem to stop).  On page 546 he says: \\"...why haven't animals developed roads?  ... roadbuilding [is]... dangerously altruistic.\\"  <br /> <br />I have a note in the margin that says \\"what about game trails?\\"  Living in the northwest, bushwhacking is usually tough, and sometimes impossible, especially on a horse.  It seems curious that Dawkins would spend so much time arguing why animals don't build roads, when they do build them, in the form of game trails.  These roads, while \\"primitive\\" are good enough that even a \\"complex\\" bipedal primate astride a large quadruped finds them handy. <br /> <br />Dawkins injects political points in a few places, with a number of well-deserved left jabs at George W. Bush.  But sometimes he fails to get all his facts in a row.  On page 565 he says: \\"But we should not forget that the only reason we have oxygen to breathe is that most of the carbon in the world is tied up underground.  We burn it at our peril.\\" <br /> <br />True, burning all the fossil fuels would be a foolhardy thing, but not because we'd die from lack of oxygen.  In his book \\"Oxygen, the molecule that made the world,\\" Nick Lane explains that sandstone rocks contain a few percent organic carbon by weight, and accounts for most of the organic carbon buried in the earth.  Only a small proportion of buried organic carbon is in the form of fossil fuels, so that even if we burned all the coal oil, and gas trapped in the Earth's crust, we would only deplete a few percent of the atmospheric oxygen.  [p. 25].   <br /> <br />Okay, you know if I could only find three mistakes in a book this long it must be good.  If you like to read about natural history and evolution, I think you'll like it. <br />	2005-05-12
US	53038410	R3SD1MLPGJ0B4Z	1560851252	660290200	Inside the Mind of Joseph Smith: Psychobiography and the Book of Mormon	Books	5	37	41	N	N	Inside the mind of a narcissist	Anderson begins by accepting the scientific evidence supporting the conclusion that the Book of Mormon is a fraud.  Within this context, and owing to its rapid dictation, he views the Book of Mormon akin to the sort of free association a psychologist might encounter with a patient.  He then applies the principles of psychoanalytic analysis to discern specific attributes and traits of Joseph Smith's personality.  In Anderson's words: <br /> <br />\\"This book is not about `Did Joseph Smith create the Book of Mormon?\\" but \\"How did Joseph Smith create the Book of Mormon.\\" [xxvi] <br /> <br />I must admit I was skeptical about the author's claim.  After all, psychoanalysis is viewed by many scientists as a branch of pseudoscience and quackery.  Anderson tempers his approach, however, and when he goes out on a limb with his explanations he's quick to point it out to the reader, and to moderate his conclusions with warnings about the limitations of his craft. <br /> <br />Even if one disregards the psychoanalytic aspects all together, this book still has considerable value.  Anderson presents a nice summary of interesting bits of early Mormonism that are probably unknown to most members, owing to the church's revisionist and exclusionary policy toward Joseph's early history.  Anderson also presents some very compelling parallels between Smith's life and key events and themes in the Book of Mormon.  <br /> <br />The author diagnoses Joseph Smith as a narcissist.  He also claims the Book of Mormon plays out (often several times) key events from Smith's life.  Some of the parallels he describes are truly interesting and hard to ignore.  Because of this, the temptation is always present to use these parallels as evidence against the Book of Mormon.  While parallels between Smith's life and the Book of Mormon do call into question the book's authenticity, one must remember that the book's fraudulent nature is accepted from the start with Anderson.   <br /> <br />With the exception of the introduction, the book is quite interesting and held my interest.  The introduction is filled (it seems) with very dry and technical information about psychoanalysis that I found hard to wade through.  This is unfortunate because it may dissuade readers who would truly enjoy later parts of the book.   <br /> <br />Anderson describes many parallels that are striking and too obvious to ignore.  Sometimes, though, I think he tries too hard, and I found some of his conclusions far fetched.  When the parallels don't quite line up he invokes inversion and exaggeration.  This left me with the occasional impression that the author was simply picking and choosing explanations - using correlation when it's there, and anti-correlation when it's not there.  That's exactly the sort of ad hoc story telling that astrologers and other superstitious people use, and it distracts somewhat from the validity of Anderson's case. <br /> <br />According to Anderson, Smith saw himself as Nephi (Nephi was just one of Smith's alter egos in the Book of Mormon), and Smith used elements of his life throughout the Book of Mormon.  Here are a few examples: <br />1) Nephi is Smith.  Later in the book, Smith uses Moroni as an alter ego <br />2) The surgeons who cut into Joseph's leg are represented by Laban and other bad guys in the story <br />3) The surgeon's knife is represented by the sword of Laban <br />4) A prophet named Nephi raised his dead brother.  The brother represents Joseph's brother, Alvin, who also died, and the story illustrates Smith's fanciful vision of himself as a great prophet <br />5) Smith's money-digging activities and superstitions are mirrored in the slippery tools and treasure in the Book of Mormon <br />6) Jesus' work with little children and the visions received by the little children represent Smith's frustration over the fact that his prophecy failed when he said his first son (born disfigured and stillborn) would translate from the gold plates <br />7) Cities, roads, political events and robbers/barons from Smith's frontier life are all represented in the Book of Mormon (Many others have commented on the obvious parallels between Book of Mormon politics and religion and Smith's sermons in the Book of Mormon). <br /> <br />Anderson claims the parallels in the Book of Mormon and Smith's actual life are so correlated that the chronology is mirrored in 3 Nephi (one of two other places where Anderson says Smith presents his life in allegory).  He outlines over a dozen of them on pages 110-111 (table 2).  Although I winced at some of his parallels, I think may of them are quite remarkable, and all of them are more striking than anything FARMS has ever presented in their comical attempts to prove the Book of Mormon's authenticity.   <br /> <br />The last few pages are among the best.  Here, Anderson illustrates how narcissistic religious leaders attract converts with particular personalities, and how the followers reinforce the leader, who then reinforces the followers in a circular fashion as they feed each other's emotional needs.  He also illustrates the narcissistic nature of the LDS Church itself: <br /> <br />\\"The narcissist not only assigns feelings and roles to other(s) but also coerces and manipulates others into taking the assignment.  A common technique is the implied threat: \\"If you don't accept the position, feeling, or role in relationship to me, I will leave or send you away.\\"  The second party - individual or group - accepts the role, abandons critical evaluation, and remains locked in a primitive form of fused function with the narcissist.\\" <br /> <br />Reading this book, I was struck by the many narcissistic characteristics found in the \\"leaders\\" that Mormons favor today.  George W. Bush, for example, has many of Smith's narcissistic qualities, and he was elected by about 72 percent of Utahans - a higher percentage than any other state.  It's as if Smith designed Mormonism so that it attracts members who value narcissistic leaders, ensuring that Joseph's legacy lives on in the controlling religious/political nature of the modern LDS Church, as victims beget victims, and narcissistic leaders egg them on. <br />	2005-04-24
US	53038410	R33P8Y1O16AA8X	0684859203	363131804	Noah's Flood: The New Scientific Discoveries About The Event That Changed History	Books	5	14	15	N	N	The origin of the Biblical myth of a world-wide flood	Ryan and Pitman's thesis is that the Black Sea used to be cut off from its entrance to the Mediterranean, and was a great inland lake.  Twenty thousand years ago the lake was filled to the brim by melt water from the last major ice age, and emptied through the Sakarya River, but by 13,000 years ago the ice had withdrawn so far to the north that the inflow to the Black Sea depression almost stopped.  This coincided with a brief mini-ice age known as the Younger Dryas which lasted for about 1000 years and was simultaneously accompanied by both cooler temperatures and general drying.   <br /> <br />During this cool, dry period the inflow to the Black Sea was reduced to the point that evaporation exceeded inflow and the lake level dropped to roughly 300-400 feet below its present level.  Because of the dry conditions during the Younger Dryas many populated regions were abandoned, including Jericho and regions in and around the Fertile Crescent.  The Black Sea, however, provided a point of respite, with fresh water and food from the lake and (because of its lower elevation) warmer temperatures.  As a result, tribes crowded around the lake and it became an agricultural area. <br /> <br />The Younger Dryas ended about 11,400 years ago, but yet another mini Ice Age set in around 6,200 BCE.  The climate reverted back to a warmer and wetter one around 5,800 BCE, and by 5,600 BCE ocean levels were higher than the Bosporus valley, which was 500 feet above the Black Sea Lake.   <br /> <br />According to Ryan and Pitman the breach happened quickly, eventually reaching a flow rate of ten cubic miles of water each day.  In the process the flood cut the straights of Bosporus, excavating a channel 280 feet deep into the topsoil and bedrock.  The flood took only a year to substantially flood the Black Sea Lake and just a couple of years to bring it to the level we see today. <br /> <br />The flood engulfed a rich valley with an agrarian culture that fled to different parts of the surrounding country when their Black Sea Lake was inundated.  Some, called Ubaids, who spoke a language later known as Sumerian, migrated into the middle of southern Mesopotamia.  There they established a remarkable culture that retained its memory of the great flood through the telling of stories that grew into myth.  This great flood myth was later adopted by the Israelites and included in their scriptures, eventually to become a key doctrine and rallying cry for millions of fundamentalist Christians, Mormons, and even a belief of the President of the United States, George W. Bush.   <br /> <br />Interestingly, if you do a Google search on the Black Sea and Noah's flood you'll find a plethora of fundamentalist organizations touting this scientific discovery as evidence for their un-scientific notions of a literal world-wide flood.  To that extent, the title of this book is unfortunate, although the authors can't really be held responsible for intellectually disingenuous religious fanatics.  I think a more appropriate (and more accurate) title would have been \\"Origin of the Myth of Noah's Flood.\\"  It's hard to say, but a more accurate title might have helped prevent such modern-day educational tragedies as the National Park Service including books about how the Grand Canyon was created by Noah's flood.   <br /> <br />The book begins with a summary of early archaeological work that traces the origin of the Biblical flood and creation myths to Babylonia, and how these myths were borrowed by the Israelites and incorporated into the Bible.   Early on, their working hypothesis was that the flood myth, though clearly not global, probably had its origin in some real, if not world-wide, event that left an indelible impression upon earth's ancient inhabitants.  The story of the scientific discovery begins with the geological surveys and ocean core samples showing that the Mediterranean Sea had dried up and become a desert several million years ago, only to be filled again withthe breach of the dam at Gibraltar. <br /> <br />Several million years ago is too far into the past to have served as the inspiration for the myth of Noah's flood, but the idea of salt water flooding a plain that lies below sea level inspired several scientists to look for other, more recent possibilities.  All the evidence came together with scientific surveys of the Black Sea.  Acoustic soundings showed the rubble from the breach at Bosporus.  Carbon 14 dating confirmed the proper age of sediments associated with the saltwater that came gushing in, and of organisms that could only thrive in sunlight, found below those sediments at depths of several hundred feet.  Indeed, the totality of the scientific evidence shows without doubt that the Black Sea was rapidly and permanently filled with sea water only a little more than 7,000 years ago.   <br /> <br />Interestingly, the authors include a cautionary statement at the end of the book, which says: \\"Short of finding the remains of Neolithic settlements beneath the mud of the present Black Sea shelf, no archaeological observation can prove a human occupation of the now submerged landscape.\\"  The book was published in 1998; a time when the sought-after archeological evidence hadn't been found.  However, in a September 13, 2000 article incorrectly titled \\"Black Sea Artifacts May Be Evidence of Biblical Flood,\\" the Washington Post reported that manmade structures have been found 300 feet beneath the surface of the Black Sea, dating to the inundation 7,500 years ago.   <br /> <br />This is truly a great book.  It's written somewhat like a scientific novel, describing a story with an amazing amount of endeavor and discovery.  It's the sort of book that's hard to put down.  I finished it in less than a week. <br />	2005-04-07
US	53038410	R21IZFOUPLP30G	0759610894	697078656	No Sense of Obligation: Science and Religion in an Impersonal Universe	Books	5	13	13	N	N	Applying reason to everything -- even religion	There are lots of books in the world about science, and lots of books about religion.  There are even lots of books about science and religion.  But there are just a handful of books on science and religion that are written with intellectual honesty, knowledge, and style.  Matt's book is in this elite group. <br /> <br />Many popular books on science and religion are written by theists convinced from the start that their god exists, and determined to find some trace of him/her/it in scientific knowledge.  Typically the author is a mystic or theologian, but occasionally they might even be a converted physicist or astronomer.  It's not uncommon for such authors to exhibit a poor sense of what science is, or how it works, and too often their books are filled with abysmal reasoning and grossly misrepresented scientific evidence. <br /> <br />Matt's book is refreshing precisely because he is the antithesis of the popular garbage.  He is both a competent scientist as well as impeccably honest with the evidence and the conclusions they lead to.   <br /> <br />This is a relatively long book (308 pages, if you include the appendix - which I recommend) but it's relatively easy to read, very enjoyable, and quite engaging.  I finished reading it in a week (I read over half of it on the airplane, while traveling to/from Hawaii).   <br /> <br />Matt's thesis is that the scientific evidence speaks to the unlikelihood of a purposeful, caring, and intelligent creator of the universe.  He's an atheist, though he specifically disavows the term because he considers it too dogmatic and disrespectful of religion (page 253).  Though atheistic in fact, I think Matt's obvious devotion to high ideals in secular Judaism will give him a sense of credibility with even the most devout theists.  At the same time, however, his theistic accommodations are likely to aggravate atheists (such as myself) who feel theism deserves no more respect than any other idea, and wince at the right-wing caricature (false, by the way) that atheism is dogmatic. <br /> <br />This book covers a lot of ground.  Matt begins by introducing the reader to the scientific method and the scientific concept of a verifiable reality.  His method is to teach by giving examples, rather than rot lecture.  Along the way he elucidates the errors in anecdotal evidence and illustrates the key character of scientific theories - they are testable, falsifiable in principle, but not falsified by the evidence.   <br /> <br />Matt doesn't reserve his magnifying glass for the theologian alone.  Also singed under the glare of his relentless logic are some of the intellectual elite.  He has harsh words for superstition and sloppy thinking wherever it's found, from the irreproducible experiments of cold fusion to the crackpots at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center who teach the medical \\"treatment\\" called Therapeutic Touch.  From the Homeopath to those who search for number sequences in Biblical verse, Matt illustrates in each example the case of human superstition gone amok.   <br /> <br />Matt's next target is what most people would call popular religion.  It's that large, loosely conglomerated assortment of anecdotal miracles, signs, and wishful thinking.  But he doesn't stop with the common man's religion.  Just as flawed are the arguments of the philosophers, as Matt illustrates while he dismantles the Ontological Argument, the Argument from First Cause, the Argument from Contingency, the Argument from Design, the Argument from Evolution, the Anthropic Principle, and the Argument from Mathematical Physics.   <br /> <br />One of the best lessons in this book is that critical thinking isn't just what people should do on Monday through Saturday (or Sunday through Friday), and set aside for religious devotions.  Though not always so, most religions have teachings that are directly testable by scientific methods, including the pervasive idea that there is some sort of all-knowing god who created the universe and thinks highly of humanity. <br /> <br />Matt also includes material that, while interesting, is a bit off track from his principle thesis.  As a strict determinist he argues there must be hidden variables in Quantum Mechanics.  His arguments in favor of hidden variables are somewhat strained and there is some important background information missing.  I think most physicists would disagree about hidden variables, but it's neither here nor there as far as religion and superstition are concerned.   <br /> <br />Matt describes himself as a strict determinist, and QM without hidden variables obviously causes problems for his philosophy.  As a strict determinist he doesn't believe that people (or any other species) have \\"free will.\\"  However, his discussions about free will fail to define exactly what it is, or how to test for its existence.  Lacking a good definition and a scientific test, speculation about the existence or non-existence of some nebulous thing called \\"free will\\" is little more than idle philosophy.  On the other hand, Matt's overall conclusion that the human mind is a consequence of the physical brain, nothing more and nothing less, is on pretty solid ground <br /> <br />His final chapter sews it all together with a discussion about how he practices religious rituals and customs as a matter of heritage and (I suspect) as a way to find inner peace and meditation.  I especially enjoyed this last chapter because Matt shows how to be introspective, sincere, and religious in form without encumbering one's self with all the unnecessary superstitious trappings that so often hitch along for the ride. <br /> <br />If you like to think, and to challenge yourself, and if you read only one book this year, you really owe it to yourself to read Matt's book.   <br />	2005-04-06
US	53038410	R2HVIMBO1JCQ95	0066620996	205785288	Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap and Others Don't	Books	4	3	4	N	N	A "pretty good" book	The author's thesis is that he knows how companies make the leap from \\"good\\" to \\"great,\\" and that he learned the principles by studying the statistical differences between companies that made the jump, and those that didn't.  <br /> <br />He begins by explaining his ability to \\"take a lump of unorganized information, see patterns, and extract order from the mess - to go from chaos to concept.\\" [page 11].  Collin's comment reminded me of another author, who wrote: \\"Human nature abhors a lack of predictability and the absence of meaning.  As a consequence, we tend to \\"see\\" order where there is none, and we spot meaningful patterns where only the vagaries of chance are operating.\\" [\\"How we know what isn't so,\\" Gilovich, page 9].  <br /> <br />While agreeing with many of his conclusions, this book lacks the statistical rigor the author ascribes to it.  The principal error involves confusion between causality and correlation.  Collins notes William P. Briggs' calculation that the probability of correlation by random chance is less than 1 in 17 million [211-212].  The calculation, while mathematically correct, is largely irrelevant because correlation does not mean \\"caused by.\\"  As an example, consider race cars which are highly correlated with advertiser's logos, although causality is clearly lacking because adding or stripping off logos won't suddenly make the cars go faster or slower.   <br /> <br />To strengthen his argument Collins should have specifically and methodologically examined the changes that happen to companies that go \\"from great to good.\\"  There are plenty of examples, including many of the \\"good-to-great\\" companies in Jim's data base.  Unfortunately, the study does this only sporadically and inconsistently, and as more of a sideline.  Compounding the problem is the fact that the author's statistical database applies only to major US companies (something he notes), though he tries to apply the \\"concepts\\" derived from these correlations to just about everything - including high school track teams and landlords. <br /> <br />In spite of some of the methodological errors in his approach, I remain impressed by the extent to which Collins collected large amounts of data, and the way he defined the most important terms that he uses.  It's true that he has a talent for finding \\"patterns,\\" but I found myself mostly agreeing with his conclusions, even if I don't share his enthusiasm for the supposed rigidity with which they were drawn.  In spite of the limitations of his work, Collins' book has a degree of rigor that's seldom approached by the plethora of evangelizing \\"management\\" and \\"leadership\\" tracts on the market.   <br /> <br />According to Collins, a \\"good\\" company has cumulative total stock returns no better than 1.25 times the general market for at least 15 years, while a great company is one that beats the general market by 3 times for at least 15 years. His selection criteria and method of ranking companies is relatively robust.  Some of the ranking methods are obviously more quantitative than others.  There is, for example, poor correlation between company performance and executive pay, employee layoffs, and corporate restructuring/acquisitions.  <br /> <br />The author draws some of his broadest conclusions from his most qualitative concepts.  For example, he defines the Hedgehog Concept as \\"... an understanding of what you can be the best at [in the whole world].\\"  That's a pretty fuzzy definition, and is ultimately unverifiable.  As a result, the author gets involved in several ad hoc arguments.  For example, on page 99 he berates Upjohn by saying:  <br /> <br />\\"Upjohn never confronted the same brutal reality [that it could not compete with an industry behemoth] and continued to live with the delusion that it could beat Merck.\\" [page 99].   <br /> <br />Yet he lauds Darwin Smith for making a similar gamble, in positioning Kimberly-Clark in competition with Procter & Gamble: <br /> <br />\\"But they reasoned, if Kimberly-Clark thrust itself into the fire of the consumer paper-products industry, world-class competition like Procter & Gamble would force it to achieve greatness or perish.\\"  [page 20]. <br /> <br />The difference between a great Hedgehog Concept and a bad one, apparently, is that the great one works and the others don't.  But with history as our guide there's no end to playing the role of Monday-morning quarter back.  <br /> <br />Part of the Hedgehog concept is tight focus.  But when faced with contrary evidence in the form of G.E., which has lots of conglomerates, the author tries to force the contrary data into his world view by arguing that GE's Hedgehog Concept is to have lots of good managers so they can manage various divisions.  There's never a coherent, global definition of what constitutes a Hedgehog Concept; it's largely tautological reasoning that establishes \\"great\\" Hedgehog Concepts as those used by \\"great\\" companies.   <br /> <br />I must temper that complaint by saying that, in spite of the less-than-rigorous nature of this book, most of what Jim says makes sense to me.  This was a most enjoyable book to read, and I've filled the margins (top, sides, and bottom) with notes and scribbles.  In particular, he gives a nicely balanced view of leadership, cutting through the baloney that's so often the core competency of people who try to write books on the subject.  Here's a typical quotation: <br /> <br />\\"George Ruthmann ... understood that the purpose of bureaucracy is to compensate for incompetence and lack of discipline...Most companies build their bureaucratic rules to manage the small percentage of wrong people on the bus, which in turn drives away the right people on the bus, which then increases the percentage of wrong people on the bus, which increases the need for more bureaucracy to compensate for incompetence ... and so forth.\\" [page 121] <br /> <br />Overall, I gave this book a high rating because it made me think.  The author has obviously spent an enormous amount of time doing research, and the book really is pretty good.  The high points certainly outweigh the problems, and I highly recommend it - especially the lengthy appendices. <br />	2005-02-16
US	53038410	RYF90QM86QY19	0878424032	241745854	Ice Age Mammals of North America	Books	5	21	23	N	N	A wonderful little book	I picked up this book while browsing the gift shop at the La Brea tar pits in Los Angeles.  I was looking for something to serve as a memento for out family trip, something that would serve as evening reading material, and something that would be interesting and educational for the kids.  This book seemed like just the ticket.  It's nicely presented with rich, glossy pages, and it's chock full of interesting/relevant photographs, black-and-white drawings, and color illustrations.   <br /> <br />Lange opens his book with a tantalizing summary of some of the exotic animals that lived during the Pleistocene, and a very short description of a changed world, covered with glaciers.  He follows this with a short but very interesting and well-written discussion about continental drift and the interchange of animals between the American and Eurasian continents.  I particularly liked his discussion of the discovery of the ice ages, and how he highlights some of the critical evidence such as oxygen-isotope shifts that make it possible for scientists to understand much of the detail of these aspects of earth's history.  This section has some exciting discussions regarding earth geology that is sure to excite the young reader and amateur geologist alike. <br /> <br />This introductory material, consisting largely of the geological evidence of ice ages, takes up roughly the first 65 pages of the book.  With the groundwork laid, Lange begins introducing the reader to the vast array of fascinating animals that lived, geologically speaking, just a moment ago.  In many ways these animals were as amazing as the dinosaurs, but while dinosaurs lived millions of years before humans evolved, the remarkable animals of the Pleistocene lived contemporaneously with our ancestors, hunted them, and were hunted by them. <br /> <br />The majority of the book's middle section consists of case-by-case descriptions of some of the more interesting (at least in terms of size and ferocity) animals fromthat period.  These include the American lion, glyptodont, mammoth ground sloth, yesterday's camel, titanis bird, long-horned giant bison, wooly mammoth Nebraska camel, American mastodon, dire wolf, Florida cave bear, giant short-faced bear, and of course, Smilodon fatalis - the saber-toothed cat.  <br /> <br />Lange doesn't just describe these animals; he helps the reader understand how they fit within the context of evolution, the evidence surrounding their discovery, and how they compare and contrast with similar modern-day animals.  It's amazing to read of these ancient animals and realize how similar America was to Africa just 12,000 years ago.  This leads Lange to his concluding ideas about extinction and the growing sense that early humans were largely responsible for the die-off of large animals in America.   <br /> <br />Over all this is a wonderful little book that packs a lot of information into relatively few pages.  It's not overly simplistic.  Quite the opposite, it describes conclusions and results from cutting-edge research.  But the book is also very approachable.  Its language, presentation, pictures and photographs make this an entertaining as well as informative story, and one that any grown or budding geologist/paleontologist is bound to enjoy.	2004-11-27
US	53038410	RFPEN7Q1XQ3T6	0231118635	659155994	Rivers in Time	Books	5	11	11	N	N	Extinction is forever	I've read one other book by Peter D. Ward, \\"The call of distant mammoths,\\" and enjoyed it immensely, so when I saw \\"Rivers in time,\\" and recognized the author's name I snatched it up right away.  <br /> <br />The first part of this book contains condensed excerpts from earth's history, with particular emphasis on the famous and most notable extinction events found in the strata.  This is preceded, and sometimes interspersed, with a brief history of geology and paleontology. Ward covers highlights relating to methods of dating sedimentary rocks using fossils, and how those techniques are anchored in radiometric dating.   <br /> <br />Ward introduces some particularly insightful information derived from some of his own field work.  This adds a nice touch, and helps the reader understand a little of the flavor associated with being a field geologist.  Chapter five for example, describes some work he did along the Pacific Coast of Canada, relating to the mass extinction at the end of the Triassic period - one of the five most catastrophic extinctions during the last 500 million years.   <br /> <br />The Triassic, Permian, Cretaceous.  Ward touches on them all, at least to some extent.  Part III is about the Cretaceous/Tertiary event, when the dinosaurs went extinct.  Here, as in other discussions, the text isn't just about the mechanics of extinction, but draws upon many ancillary issues that add depth and flavor to the discussion.  Particularly interesting is his historical discussion of the scientific debate that led to the currently accepted view that a large comet or meteorite was a major (if not the major) contributor to the Cretaceous/Tertiary event.  This part of the book contains interesting tidbits of information that many arm-chair scientists will, no doubt, enjoy.  One passage that I underlined was the following: <br /> <br />\\"... the pollen from normal plants found in that [New Mexico] region at the time suddenly disappeared, to be replaced by a pollen and spore assemblage made up almost completely of fern material.  Ferns are well-known \\"disaster\\" species because they quickly move into and colonize disturbed landscapes, such as newly burned land.\\" <br /> <br />Upon reading this I reflected upon the clear-cut that I had wandered across last year, with my horse, riding through the hills of the coast range in western Oregon.  It was like a complete swath of destruction laid before me, with the shattered stumps of trees littering the landscape into the hazy distance, liberally punctuated with clumps of ferns. <br /> <br />I have a hunch that the real point of Ward's book is found in section IV, \\"The modern mass extinction.\\"   The modern mass extinction started more than 10,000 years ago, and continues unabated today.  Ward argues that we are witnessing one of the largest (if not the largest) extinction events in terms of total species lost.  He lists several studies, some more alarming than others, indicating that the rate of extinction is probably in the range of thousands of species per year. <br /> <br />Ward never really forces the conclusion that people are the cause of these extinctions, but he does present some pretty incriminating data pointing to our species as the culprit.  Mostly the evidence is circumstantial.  A natural paradise exists without humans, humans arrive, mass extinction ensues.  It happened in Hawaii (both with the indigenous population, and later with European invaders), the America, Australia, Madagascar, New Zeeland, and so forth.  <br /> <br />Ward also points to studies that help illustrate the complexity of extinction.  Most extinctions are not caused by a single factor.  And (as in the case of Madagascar) extinctions don't have to follow necessarily from hunting or otherwise deliberate killing of animals.  They can (and do) happen because of habitat destruction and habitat compartmentalization and division.  Something as simple as building a road through a wilderness area can be enough to tip the balance. <br /> <br />The cover of Ward's book shows a stark and barren landscape with dry riverbeds streaking through the sparse, brown bush.  These rivers no longer run.  The symbolism for extinction is deliberate.  We all know that organisms and species die, but we still morn their passage.  And when they die an untimely death, when their demise could have been prevented, it leaves a bitter taste of remorse and regret.   <br /> <br />I remember when I first learned about extinction.  I was a kid, and my mother told me there used to be this flightless bird, about the size of a turkey or a chicken, and how it no longer existed because people hunted it to extinction.  I remember the deep sense of remorse that I felt - cheated is a good way to describe it - at the fact I could only see this amazing creature as a stuffed exhibit in a museum.  Later, when school kids laughed about how the \\"stupid\\" dodo had gone extinct, I felt a shudder of shame for my species. <br /> <br />As I read this book I found my self repeatedly wishing that the knowledge found between its covers could be imparted to every one of the politicians responsible for safeguarding what's left of our environment, and realizing in bitter disappointment that, with the election of radical Christian fundamentalists who now control the Congress and White House, the rush toward extinction has only shifted into a higher gear.  As I tell my kids, enjoy the wilderness you see.  Climb these glaciers, breath deeply the mountain air, because it is quickly disappearing.  I'd call Ward's book valuable and informative, and hopefully it will spur a few to try and stop the onslaught, but ultimately I found the story depressing.  Extinction really is forever.	2004-11-26
US	53038410	R1842TM85PSGP0	0760745420	827749663	The First Chimpanzee In Search of Human Origins	Books	5	9	9	N	N	98.4% Human	This is a book about genetic dating and the role it has played in helping to shed light on human evolution.<br /><br />Most folks who are familiar with geology are also aware of a class of dating techniques ubiquitously lumped together under the label of radiometric dating.  Carbon 14 is, perhaps, the most commonly known of these, but there are many other types as well.<br /><br />The authors explain relatively early in their book the basic idea behind radiometric dating, which is the quantum-mechanically observed fact that, in a group of unstable isotopes there is a particular percentage that, on average, will decay to their daughter products in any given period of time.  Specifically, in the half-life of the isotope, half the atoms will decay.<br /><br />Radiometric dating provides a means of accurately determining the age since formation of many different types of materials.  Carbon 14 is one isotope that is useful for dating samples that were once living, but are now dead.  Other, longer-lived, isotopes can be used for dating various types of volcanic rocks.  What Gribbin and Cherfas have done in \\"The first chimpanzee\\" is show how a similar technique can be applied to sequences in our genes.<br /><br />Early in the book the authors introduce the reader to DNA and the genetic code.  They also have one of the best introductory explanations for what it actually means - in terms of laboratory testing and results - to say that this or that species share X amount of their genetic code.  Wrapping up this discussion is the rather humbling, remarkable (and, upon reflection, expected) result that humans and chimpanzees have almost all their genetic material in common. As they carefully explain, genetic sequencing has reached the point where very specific statements can be made regarding the differences in the genetic makeup of different species.  For example, according to Gribbin and Cherfas:<br /><br /> \\"We now know from multiple lines of evidence that genetic similaritybetween us and chimpanzees is 98.4 per cent, and that's pretty exact.  It's not 98.3, and it's not 98.5 but is 98.4 per cent.\\"<br /><br />This means that chimps and humans are more closely related to each other than to any other species.  We are their closest evolutionary relative, and they are ours.  We are more closely related to chimps than rats are to mice.  Indeed, we are as closely related to chimps as horses are to donkeys.  Chimps are more related to us, than they are to gorillas.<br /><br />Upon laying this introductory groundwork, Gribbin and Cherfas proceed by showing that two species that descended from a common ancestor start out with identical DNA, which then (in the process of speciation) drifts divergently but at the same rate.  This means that, once the rate of the molecular clock is determined, the genetic differences between species can be used to reliably date the point at which they diverged from their most recent common evolutionary ancestor. As they word it in their book:<br /><br />\\"The number of accumulated differences tells the time since the two species became evolutionarily distinct because mutation is a random process, as is the decay of a radioactive element, and while you can never say exactly which nucleotides will change, or when, you can say with some confidence how many of the millions of letters in the human genetic code will change in 1,000 years, 100,000 years, or a million years.\\"<br /><br />This is really the crux of the book, and they deliver it on page 115.  The rest of the book is aimed at illustrating additional details that highlight the application of the theory, especially regarding the relationship between humans and chimps.  In the process they give examples and evidence that provide the scientific backup for the assumptions and data that go into the analysis, and the results that come out.  They show, for example, several ways to calibrate the molecular clock, justifying assumptions for common rates of mutation in related species, and illustrating how the results from molecular dating are in nice agreement with the strict evidence from the fossil record (though not necessarily in agreement with assumptions made about the fossil record).<br /><br />Some of the material is a little specialized, and the authors clearly are speaking, at times, to skeptical colleagues.  Just the same I was able to easily follow the text, and I personally found this book interesting, full of information, and possessing a significant \\"Ahhhh\\" factor.<br /><br />Their conclusion (found on page 283, but reiterated many other times in earlier parts of the text) is that:<br /><br /> \\"The origin of the primates cannot have occurred more than 75 million years ago; the primates of the New and Old Worlds diverged no more than 35 million years ago (comfortably agreeing, by the way, with geophysical evidence for the break-up of the former super continent); Old World monkeys split from the hominoids no more than 20 million years ago, and the modern ape family began to radiate approximately 15 million years ago; gibbon and orangutan diverged 11 and 8 million years ago and finally (ignoring the more recent divergence into pygmy and modern chimp, mountain and lowland gorilla) there was the three-way split between man, chimp and gorilla no more than 4 million years ago.<br /><br />For anyone interested in evolution, and human evolution in particular, this book is essential reading.  It's clearly written in a way that most non-scientists, with careful reading, should be able to follow, and it has sufficient detail to interest the scientific non-specialist as well.  For me it was a wealth of new information and yet another reminder of our connectedness with nature.	2004-11-24
US	53038410	RDUMD68S13UFH	0882905171	404567273	From Critic to Convert: A Skeptic Questions His Way to Mormonism.	Books	2	11	16	N	N	Where's the skeptic?	I've written a number of reviews critical of the LDS Church.  I'm also the author of \\"Farewell to Eden: Coming to terms with Mormonism and science.\\"  Because of this exposure I'm blessed with frequent email from faithful Mormons, bent on helping me see the error of my ways.  A recent Latter-day Saint, upon seeing my reviews, wrote to assure me that there are \\"thousands\\" of critics who, yearly, accept Mormonism, presumably because it's the only logical thing to do.  He referred me to this book, so I took the suggestion.   <br /> <br />My first impression with this book is that the title is wrong.  There seems to be an undercurrent of cultural envy among Mormons (members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) regarding secular humanism.  On the one hand, Mormonism is firmly established as a superstitious/emotional/spiritual philosophy.  On the other hand, the church seems self-conscious over this legacy, desiring to be viewed as more rational and critical than they really are.  It seems this dichotomy is largely behind the title of Morgan's book.   You'd expect, from Morgan's title, that the book would have at least a token example of actual critical thinking in it.  <br /> <br />According to the dictionary, a critic as \\"one who expresses a reasoned opinion on any matter especially involving a judgment of its value, truth, righteousness, beauty, or technique b: one who engages often professionally in the analysis, evaluation, or appreciation of works of art or artistic performances.\\"   <br /> <br />The problem is, Willard Morgan is (and was) no \\"skeptic.\\"  Instead, Morgan's book is a rather transparent attempt to remake the story of an average Mormon convert into something more significant than it really is.   <br /> <br />Given the inappropriate title, the most remarkable thing about Morgan's book is the manner in which he fails totally to adequately address (or even mention, in most cases) any of the major intellectual and scientific issues facing Mormonism.  Take, for example, the Book of Mormon.  Mormons claim that the Book of Mormon was written by and about the ancient Americans, and yet it describes the ancient Americans smelting steel, using domesticated horses, and cultivating Old World crops like wheat and barley.  All these claims are patently false.  Scientists consider the Book of Mormon's description of ancient American to be fantasy, and yet Morgan claims to be a \\"critic\\" while utterly failing to address the fraudulent nature of the Book of Mormon within a scientific context.  This seems the antithesis of a \\"reasoned opinion.\\" <br /> <br />Mormonism's problems with science are legion.  Joseph Smith's amusing statements about astronomy and his failed attempts at \\"translating\\" Egyptian expose him as one of the more notorious (although highly successful) con men of the 19th century.  For Morgan to claim to have been a \\"skeptic\\" in his investigation of Mormonism while ignoring most (and failing to adequately deal with any) of these issues leaves his book with an air of desperation.  Are there really no skeptical converts to Mormonism?  Is Morgan's story - the story of a non-skeptic dressed up as one - the best the church can find?   I'm not sure if Willard's book illustrates just how devoid of critical thought Mormonism is (by virtue of the fact that Morgan - a non critic - is touted as a one) or if this book simply represents the low bar for critical and logical thought that's set within the LDS community.  My best guess is that it's a little of both. <br /> <br />This isn't a book for intellectuals, but rather a book written by a \\"believer\\" for \\"believers.\\"  Morgan wasn't a \\"skeptic.\\"  He was a young man searching for god (a self-described \\"prayerful agnostic\\").  His story isn't so much about dealing skeptically with the many real and pressing intellectual problems within Mormonism (especially those relating to science) as it is about someone with a penchant for religion who chooses Mormonism over the religious objections of other preachers and ministers.  Skeptics and thinkers will find the arguments either boring or embarrassing for their lack of logical rigor, while the true believers will, no doubt, be swept up in waves of emotional bliss at the thought of their \\"testimonies\\" having been certified by one of the world's own \\"critics.\\" <br /> <br />Rife with appeals to emotionalism, spiritualism, and scriptural arguments that only fellow Bible thumpers could appreciate (or care about), this is strictly a religious book, with (as near as I could tell) nary a drop of skepticism found between the two covers.	2004-11-18
US	53038410	R3345PXRM149EK	0691058547	350618042	e: The Story of a Number	Books	5	132	133	N	N	More than the story of the second-most famous number	This is the second book by Eli Maor that I have read and reviewed in as many months (the previous book was \\"To Infinity and beyond\\"). As I was reading this latest book I thought several times that the title was wrong. I think a more appropriate title might be \\"A popular introduction to calculus\\" or \\"The road to calculus.\\" Then, again, he does more than just calculus, too. So I'm not sure what to call it. It's more than just about e, and it's more than just about calculus. It's all that, with a lot of other interesting tidbits tied in as well. While Eli does spend quite a bit of time discussing e, this book goes well beyond a simple linear history of a number that's fundamental to modern mathematics. <br />Eli begins his story with John Napier and the invention/use of logarithms as tools for calculation. I found this introduction interesting because it reminded me how valuable calculation tools were, in the days before electronic calculators. I even found myself rummaging through my desk for that long-forgotten slide rule and remembering with a degree of nostalgia the many hours spent working through problems in mathematics and physics during my high school years, and how I'd pride myself on being able to carry the a full three significant digits through a complex sting of calculations. <br />It seems as though the initial chapters of Maor's book deal more with the history of e than does the middle of the book. Somewhere around page 40 Maor moves away from mathematical history aimed squarely at natural logarithms and focuses more on what is (I suspect) his true love: calculus. This is one of the best introductions to calculus I've seen, primarily because Maor did such a nice job of bring together all the historical footnotes.  <br />Coincidentally, as I was reading Mayor's book my wife was taking a class for teachers, aimed at educators who teach calculus in the middle and high schools. She found the book immensely helpful in both dealing with the actual mathematicsin her class as well as providing insight into ways of introducing concepts relating to higher-level mathematics to young students. She introduced Mayor's book to other students in her class, as well as the professor (who had read it already, of course), all of whom enjoyed it immensely.  <br />In terms of the history that he covers, I thought the discussion relating to Newton and Leibniz was the most interesting. My own coursework in Physics used Newton's dot notation, while my courses in mathematics adopted Leibniz's differential notation. Reading Maor's book provided a bit more insight into the historical quirks that led to the notation in common use today. <br />Especially interesting was his discussion about Newton's approach to the calculus. I think that if students had to use the notation and approach first used by Newton, calculus might still be relegated largely to the college curriculum. I really had no idea, before reading Maor's book, how convoluted Newton's approach was in comparison to that used by Leibniz. Newton is often portrayed (rightfully so) as a genius, and Mayor's description of Newton's calculus left me marveling that Newton managed to work through it as he did, given the (relatively) more difficult approach he took. <br />The end of Maor's book uses the calculus to illustrate several examples showing how e appears in various mathematical and physical problems. There are examples using aerodynamic drag, music, spirals, hanging chains and the cycloid. No discussion of e would be complete without a nice explanation of the function that is its own derivative, which Maor tells with characteristic clarity. <br />Frequently while reading Maor's book I found myself wishing I'd had this introduction before taking several of the classes I took during my school years. His treatment of the complex plane, for example, is as clear as his introduction to basic ideas in calculus. Looking back on my first class in complex variables, I recall the fog that surrounded my initial introduction to conformal mapping. Maor, though, makes it easy. With the skill of a master educator, he manages to explain the concept with such ease that you learn the essential ideas almost before you realize where he is taking you. Though most texts of this sort would not tread on a subject as foreboding to the general public as the Cauchy-Riemann equations, Maor explains the basic concepts as clearly and almost as effortlessly as he does conformal mapping. Ordinarily I wouldn't think it's possible to explain Cauchy-Riemann in a book that's intended for the general public with an interest in mathematics, but that's what Maor does, and he does it well. <br />In short, this nice little book manages to cover a lot of mathematical territory with the skill that only a master educator can muster. It is definitely a whole lot more than just the story of the second-most famous number in mathematics.	2004-11-09
US	53038410	R15HPA707GV4MC	0691025118	17626715	To Infinity and Beyond:  A Cultural History of the Infinite	Books	5	17	19	N	N	Should appeal to both mathematicians and poets	Maor has written a book for both mathematicians and poets. Since he is a mathematician himself there is, to be sure, plenty of math in Maor's book. But the book should also appeal to the aesthetic side of many readers (me included) by exploring human perspectives of infinity, such as how we try to relate to the concept at a personal level, and how different people have tried to capture the notion in art and prose.  <br />The book is arranged in four parts, dealing with the mathematical concept of infinity (how it shows up in algebra, etc.), geometrical infinity, aesthetic infinity (both art and poetry) and cosmological infinity.  <br />The section on mathematical infinity has the typical assortment of historical examples, beginning with examples like the runner's paradox made famous by Zeno. There are also examples of infinite series that converge, including examples of how ancient mathematicians invented infinite series for transcendental numbers like pi. There's a plethora of little tidbits found throughout this section in little mini chapters that are short essays, only a few pages long, that give surprisingly succinct, tantalizing, and often delicious examples of mathematical infinity. Reading this book I was struck by what good reading it makes for any student preparing to take a class in calculus. <br />Some of the author's most interesting material is the author's discussions about infinite series. I particularly enjoyed his  examples how the associative property doesn't hold for infinite series (a non-intuitive fact that often comes as a surprise to many new students). Ordinarily, if you have a string of numbers that are connected by addition (x1+x2+x3+..+xn) for example, you can rearrange their order and get the same result. One of the strange things about infinity, though, is that rearranging the terms in an infinite series can result in the limit of the series changing from one number to another.  <br />Of course no discussion about infinity would be complete  without mentioning Cantor, which Maor does with particular  clarity for first-time readers. Indeed, this is one of the things I  like about Maor best - he's written a book that is fun to read, even if you already know most of the stuff. It's engaging and entertaining, and full of \\"ahh\\" and \\"ohhh\\" even when you find yourself reading about something you studied many years ago. At the same time this is a good introductory text for anyone (I'm thinking youngsters in high school) who wants to start exploring some of these mathematical concepts, and need a friendly introductory text. If you can manage first-year algebra you have the tools you need to follow what Maor is talking about, though be advised that he doesn't shirk when producing equations, though most of the math is relegated to the appendices.  <br />The section on geometric infinity is punctuated by nice illustrations and those geometrical shapes that you may have heard about - the ones with things like finite volume but infinite surface area. This was one of those rare occasions where I found myself wishing Maor had gone a little further. Instead of simply showing how such objects exist in mathematics, he really should have explained the apparent \\"paradox\\" (it's not hard). Instead, he makes the example more of a \\"paradox\\" than it really is by mixing metaphors in talking about \\"painting\\" the surface. Of course mathematicians have one idea about painting a surface (mathematical paint has no thickness), but the beginning reader is likely to be mostly confused - too bad, since Maor clearly has the skill to explain the trick. <br />Maor's exploration of the infinite is (almost) infinite. He has a wonderful section on tiling, and some brilliant plates representing some of the best mathematical art that attempts to depict the nfinite. The section on cosmology and the infinite is a nice summary of the history of astronomy and how astronomers and cosmologists have vacillated over the years between a cosmos thatis infinite, then finite and bounded. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It is well written and both easy and fun to read. My only complaints are rather minor. Several times Maor treats infinity as a \\"big number\\" (it's not a number at all, and he makes that clear, but his terminology on this score isn't as  consistent as it should be). And, he refers to mathematics as a science. Well, I suppose he's entitled to his opinion on that one, <br />though I imagine it will continue to be debated. Count me as one of those who puts mathematics in the \\"tools\\" category, separate from science.  <br />The fact these inconsequential gripes are all I can find to complain about tells you what a really fine book this is. If you love mathematics, this book really needs to be in your library.	2004-11-09
US	53038410	R3EZ8DNCLGKQQM	0972881301	112004689	The Keystone of Mormonism	Books	5	72	84	N	N	Engaging -- tough to put down	Arza's is yet another story of a faithful lifetime member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon) who decides to investigate the claims of the Book of Mormon and research church history only to discover all sorts of problems, inconsistencies, and deception.  And, like others, Arza went on to write a book about what he found and ended up getting excommunicated.  Such is the all-to-common fate of intelligent and honest members of the church who look too deeply at the shadowy history of Mormonism. <br /> <br />\\"The Keystone of Mormonism\\" is ostensibly a book about the Book of Mormon, which was written by the church's founder, Joseph Smith, and is presented by the church as literal scriptural history of ancient America.  Arza's taken the title of his book from a comment by Joseph Smith (founder of the Mormon Church) to the effect that the Book of Mormon is \\".... The most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion...\\"   <br /> <br />While the first part of Arza's book is about the Book of Mormon, and its many well-known and serious problems with science, the second half is a treatise on LDS doctrine and some of the darker episodes in LDS history.  Woven throughout Arza's book is his clear and unmistakable conclusion that Smith was a con artist, adulterer, and a shrewd and calculating cult leader devoid of common standards of morality and decency.  This, of course, is the polar opposite of how Mormons view their leader.  The difference being largely due to the way in which Mormons are raised on a diet of official historical fiction/fantasy, while Arza's conclusions are drawn from his extensive examination of historical documents and even-handed application of standards for moral decency.  <br /> <br />For devout Mormons, Arza's book will hardly be convincing.  It's simply too easy for true believers to glibly ignore critical information about the church while claiming the apostates are possessed of a \\"lying tongue,\\" and givenover to the devil.  What these members would see, if they'd bother looking, is that virtually all of Arza's conclusions are drawn from pronouncements made by church leaders, who were speaking in their capacity as \\"prophets, seers, and revelators\\" while publishing their teachings using church avenues of communication.   <br /> <br />For example, one of Arza's points is that Smith was full of himself, and that he organized the church, in part, to feed an insatiable ego.  To back this up, Arza quotes dozens of passages from church documents that illustrate how egotistical Smith really was.  Here is an example from the Doctrine and Covenant (official LDS scripture):   <br /> <br />\\"Whatsoever they [Smith and other priesthood leaders in the church] shall speak when moved upon by the Holy Ghost shall be scripture, shall be the will of the Lord, shall be the mind of the Lord, shall be the word of the Lord, shall be the voice of the Lord, and the power of God unto salvation.\\"   <br /> <br />Mormons often quote this scripture to justify strict obedience to their church leaders, but Arza helps see this statement (and dozens of others, equally full of pride) as the ambition of a backwoods con artist who had finally attained the level of respect and adoration that he so desperately needed.  Arza then shows how this thirst for human praise exists today in the General Authorities of the church when they do things like having themselves \\"sustained\\" twice yearly as \\"prophets, seers, and revelators.\\"   <br /> <br />To many non-Mormons the esteem with which Mormons hold Smith borders on worship.  Indeed, while mainline Christian churches attribute the resurrection solely to Jesus Christ, in Mormonism the resurrection is predicated upon Joseph Smith's say-so.  Here is another choice reference from Arza's book: <br /> <br />\\"How are you going to get your resurrection? You will get it by the President of the resurrection pertaining to this generation, and that is Joseph Smith Jun. Hearit all ye ends of the earth; if ever you enter into the kingdom of God it is because Joseph Smith let you go there. This will apply to Jews and Gentiles, to the bond, and the free; to friends and foes; no man or woman in this generation will get a resurrection and be crowned, without Joseph Smith saying so. The man who was martyred in Carthage Jail, State of Illinois, holds the keys of life and death to this generation. He is the President of the resurrection in this dispensation, ...\\" (Brigham Young, unpublished Discourse, October 8, 1854). <br /> <br />Another persistent theme in Arza's book is the manner in which the LDS Church uses \\"persuasive techniques\\" to cajole members into compliance.  For example, on page 131, Arza says: <br /> <br /> \\"If a child can be so thoroughly indoctrinated that he or she becomes incapable of spontaneous, independent thinking, this extinguishment of individuality may be considered a serious form of child abuse.\\"   <br /> <br />Arza illustrates the church's use of family as an extension of power, effectively using mothers, fathers, and siblings to exert extraordinary pressure on individuals to conform, pressure that the organization alone could never muster. <br /> <br />The preeminent example of a hidden agenda, deceit, and sexual exploitation all rolled into one is the practice of polygamy as taught by the LDS Church.  Indeed a significant portion of Arza's book is aimed at discussing polygamy, and especially the immoral way in which Joseph Smith committed adultery while pretending that his sexual indiscretions were done at the command of God under the guise of polygamy.  Particularly damning is the manner in which Arza reviews the historical documentation showing that Smith engaged in this lewd sexual conduct under the guise of polygamous marriages to women who, at the time, were already married to other men. <br /> <br />I found Arza's book to be hard hitting, but mostly fair and balanced.  He certainly pulls no punches in holding Mormonism up to the standards it professes, and illustrating quite convincingly (I think) the church's failure to do as they preach.	2004-11-09
US	53038410	R2C70ZYOI2IE4H	1593301111	28171385	Suddenly Strangers	Books	5	68	74	N	N	A common story that many faithful will nevertheless deny	Think, for a moment, of your closest confidant, kindred spirit, and soul mate. Now imagine waking to find they no longer know you. They hardly recognize your face, no longer understand what you are thinking, or share your deepest feelings and greatest fears. They look at you - no, they look through you - as if you are a stranger.  <br />Though you might never guess it from the slick, family-centered commercials they air, this is the all-to-common heritage for thinking members of the Mormon Church, who take the difficult road to intellectual apostasy.  <br />\\"Suddenly Strangers\\" is the story of two brothers who were raised in Utah, in an \\"all-American family\\" complete with doting mother, devoted father, loyal siblings, and a deep attentiveness to their religious faith. It's hard to think of a more fitting picture than sun-speckled boys and girls working the family farm during the week while attending their deep religious Mormon faith, members of arguably the most successful and fastest-growing American-born religion.  <br />Theirs is the story of courageous intellectual strength resulting in their eventual departure from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and subsequent journey into that realm where family and friends became, suddenly, strangers.  <br />Few religions castigate their apostates as viciously as does the Mormon Church. Those who dare leave discover siblings and once-close friends who now view them contemptuously as misguided at best, and lost souls, or Sons of Perdition, at worst. It is a legacy of shattered familial relationships and lost friends. Parents grieve with despair at the thought of spiritual consequences darker than death. Local congregations whisper quietly while busybodies speculate about the cause of such wickedness in their mists, and wonder in awe at what great sin (was it adultery or fornication?) lead the apostate to lose his way and succumb to the temptations of the devil.  <br />It's a tale as old as the church itself,but this story loses its effectiveness in the abstract, antiseptic environment of statistics and detached descriptive verse. This is a story that truly can only be lived. For everyone else there are the heart-felt stories of people like Brad and Chris who, through their engaging accounts, have offered us a the opportunity to see life through the eyes of just two of many fine and honest intellectuals who finally found the courage to say \\"No.\\" \\"No\\" to the lies, and \\"no\\" to the deception.  <br />In reading this book, you will experience the early exuberance of being a member of the \\"only true church,\\" content to accept without question whatever your leaders tell you. You'll follow the metamorphosis from unquestioning sheep to thoughtful and critical explorer. Through these pages you will experience the simultaneous despair of learning a lifetime of indoctrination was based on lies, while at the same time learning the un-paralleled exuberance of finally being free to let your intellect soar. And through it all you will see the sudden transformation of family and friends from dearest companions to strangers.  <br />Each person who makes this choice arrives at the conclusion in his or her own personal way. For some it is the many conflicts between Mormonism and science. For others, Brad and Chris included, it is the way the Mormon Church denies some of its most embarrassing and controversial doctrines in public, and misleads its members regarding the role the Church played in Utah's past. Two issues are particularly worth noting. One is the ethical problem of misrepresenting doctrine, and the other is the intellectual problem of holding on to \\"the only true and living church,\\" given the violent, sexist, and racist doctrines of some LDS prophets such as Brigham Young.  <br />Although the real power of this book is on the emotional level in describing the reaction that Mormons often (typically?) have when someone leaves the fold, Brad and Chris have included some helpful and interesting historical and factual information as well (found in the appendixes). The information relates primarily to two areas: the church's past denial of, and involvement in, polygamy, and especially the unholy tendency of some early leaders to acquire the wives of other men. It most definitely was not (as I was taught) a case of \\"old women\\" being given in plural marriage as an act of charity. Rather, it has all the characteristics of good old carnal lust.  <br />The other area relates to violent doctrines taught by early prophets of the church relating to what's called \\"blood atonement,\\" where the offending Latter-day Saint is expected to relinquish their life (slitting the throat is the prescribed method) in order to atone for sins (like apostasy from the church) that are not covered by Jesus' atonement. The appendix material describes these teachings in detail with excerpts from early church documents, and shows how the bloody sermons of Brigham Young and other Mormon General Authorities led to such horrific crimes as the murders at Mountain Meadows.  <br />For those who have an interest in Mormonism, and want to get a clearer look at the human equation, this book is a must. It's well written, engaging, informative, and (gauging from my own experience) both accurate and relatively typical. <br />	2004-10-06

The basic premise is that six dimensionless numbers govern the state of our universe so precisely that if any of them changed by even a tiny amount the result would be the impossibility of life, as we know it.  <br />The term \\"number\\" here is important, as these are all dimensionless ratios and fractions. According to Rees the numbers are: <br />1) Ratio of electrical force to gravitational force (10^36) <br />2) Fraction of rest mass converted to energy when hydrogen fuses (0.007) <br />3) Ratio of actual density to critical density in universe (close to 1.0) <br />4) Ratio of gravity to antigravity (very small) <br />5) Ratio of gravitational binding energy of galaxies to their rest-mass energy (10^-5) <br />6) Number of spatial dimensions in our universe (3)  <br />Rees argues that if any of these numbers were slightly different from what they really are, the universe as we know it would not exist. For example, if the ratio of electrical force to gravitational force was larger (by just a \\"few zeros\\") the universe would exist for only a short time and there would be no time for the biological evolution that led to animals such as us. Similarly, if the fusion of hydrogen to helium released much more energy than it does, stars would burn out more quickly, again leading to a universe in which animals like us would not have time to evolve.  <br />Punctuated throughout the book are references (sometimes abbreviated) to the larger question of why these six numbers, and why the values they have. There's a natural sense of awe and amazement that these numbers all just happened to have precisely the values needed to make life, as we know it, possible. Such amazement leads, naturally enough, to various attempts to explain the apparent coincidence.  <br />Perhaps the first question is whether it's a coincidence at all. That is, perhaps the universe was \\"designed\\" by a \\"god\\" who picked the numbers, knowing before hand exactly what values were needed. Of course this explanation leaves us asking why there is a \\"god,\\" which seems like as big (or bigger) question than why a half-dozen ratios have the values they do. So this line of reasoning doesn't seem to take us very far.  <br />Another approach is to invoke the anthropic principle (I think this is the one Rees prefers). In other words, we see the universe the way it is because if it were any other way we would not exist to wonder about it. Okay, so that doesn't really \\"explain\\" anything, either - or, at the very least, it seems just a little too convenient. After all, couldn't we invoke the anthropic principle for just about anything? And if we did, what would happen to our sense of wonder and our desire to learn more - to push back the string of \\"why?\\" questions at least one more level?  <br />On the other hand, suppose the apparent coincidence is just that; apparent? Suppose these numbers are all somehow related. Suppose that if any one of them is in the right range, all the others will be in the right range, too. That might be the case, but as Rees explains, \\"At the moment ... we cannot predict any one of them from the values of the others.\\" Although we don't know for sure, it's possible that physics will eventually uncover the \\"theory of everything\\" and the ratios will all be in there, in a very nateral and logical way.  <br />Or, perhaps the answer is simply \\"because that's the way things are.\\"  <br />Anyone who's been around children (or been a child themselves) knows about the \\"why?\\" game. It starts out with something like this: \\"Daddy (or Mommy), why is the sky blue?\\" So you explain about Rayleigh scattering and the fact that molecules in the atmosphere scatter photons with an efficiency that's inversely proportional to the fourth power of the wavelength. You are hardly finished when the next question shoots across your bow: Daddy (or Mommy) why is there an atmosphere?\\" So you dutifully explain planetary evolution, the expulsion of vast quantities of carbon dioxide that facilitated the evolution of life forms that exploit photosynthesis, producing oxygen, etc. Then the third question comes \\"Daddy (or Mommy) why do planets form?\\" You follow this question with a short lecture on the planetary nebular hypothesis. But the questions don't stop; they just keep coming and coming and coming. There is, it seems, never an answer that cannot be followed with \\"why?\\"  <br />If we did have a \\"theory of everything,\\" and if it did explain these six ratios, there would still be the question \\"why this theory of everything?\\" And if we answer that, there undoubtedly will be another \\"why\\" question after it. Is there ever an answer that cannot be followed with \\"why?\\" That's the real question, for me, in Rees' book. Would the string of questions stop if we could answer why there are just \\"six numbers,\\" and why they have the values they have? Or, could it be that we might answer that question simply to discover a new \\"why\\" question? And if not, how would we know if or when we've arrived at the final answer: \\"Because that's just the way things are?\\"  <br />This book covers a lot of ground, and does so in abbreviated style in many instances. It's something of a quick cosmic tour. I liked it best for the way it helped me think a little more deeply about the bigger picture. It's a fun book to read, and definitely well worth the time. <br />	2004-10-06

The intrigue in Krakauer's book results from a combination of the ritualistic nature of the murders and their religious motivation, founded on the teachings of the early prophets of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS or Mormon).<BR> <BR>When Krakauer's book was first published, it caused a great deal of consternation among officials in the Mormon Church in Salt Lake City.  Church officials tried discrediting Krakauer's book by claiming he is \\"no historian,\\" and just a \\"storyteller.\\"  Some officials made extreme accusations like, \\"Krakauer unwittingly puts himself in the same camp as those who believe every German is a Nazi, every Japanese a fanatic, and every Arab a terrorist.\\" (...)<br />To understand the church's wild accusations against Krakauer, and to appreciate fully the true nature of the story he tells, one must first understand two important facts.  First, the Lafferty's were excommunicated Mormons; they were not members of the church when they committed their murders. Secondly, the Lafferty boys had been excommunicated for following doctrines taught by the early prophets of the LDS Church.  Though Krakauer makes clear their excommunicated status, the damage from his book is the revealing way in which Krakauer illustrates how their strange and dangerous behavior was a result of searching for, and abiding by, the teachings of early Mormon leaders such as Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.<br />One must also appreciate the paranoia with which the LDS Church defends its public reputation from authors like Krakauer who tell non-faith-promoting aspects of the church's history.  The church spends millions of dollars a year promoting an image of Mormons as honest, clean-cut, family-centered, and law abiding.  While this image is relatively accurate today (as it is for many other religions, aswell) the situation in the early history of the church was much different.  The damage done by ex-members like the Lafferty boys, and authors like Krakauer, who tell their stories, is that they hold a mirror up to the modern-day church which shows the darker image of the violent doctrines lurking in the church's past.<br />With regard to Krakauer's story, the two most significant doctrines are polygamy and blood atonement.  Polygamy, of course, involved the early LDS doctrine of men marrying more than one wife.  LDS leaders taught that the practice of plural marriage was necessary for \\"eternal life\\" and most (if not all) of the General Authorities in the church practiced it.  Brigham Young (second president of the church) had at least sixteen wives who bore him 57 children, and was \\"sealed\\" through polygamous church marriages to many others.<br />While polygamy is familiar to many Mormons today (the doctrine is still in LDS scriptures though the church has temporarily suspended the practice) many members are unfamiliar with Brigham Young's other teachings regarding blood atonement.  According to Young, there are some sins that are so serious (apostasy from the LDS Church being one of them) that the only way a person could \\"atone\\" for the sin is to have their blood shed - and slitting of the throat was the prescribed method:<br />\\"I could refer you to plenty of instances where men have been righteously slain, in order to atone for their sins. I have seen scores and hundreds of people for whom there would have been a chance... if their lives had been taken and their blood spilled on the ground as a smoking incense to the Almighty, but who are now angels to the Devil... I have known a great many men who have left this Church for whom there is no chance whatever for exaltation, but if their blood had been spilled, it would have been better for them....\\" [Sermon by President Brigham Young, delivered in the Mormon Tabernacle, February 8, 1857; printed in the Deseret News,February 18, 1857; also reprinted in the Journal of Discourses, Vol. 4, pages 219-220]<br />The LDS doctrine of blood atonement is at the crux of the murders committed by the Lafferty brothers.  They researched the early doctrines of LDS leaders, and convinced themselves that later prophets wrongly changed Joseph Smith's teachings.  Their research resulted in them leaving the LDS Church and becoming fundamentalist Mormons - Mormons who profess to live their lives in tune with all the doctrines taught by Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, including polygamy and blood atonement.  The sad result of their association with these horrific LDS doctrines was the murder of two innocents.  <br />Krakauer's book weaves together two different but related stories.  One story is the sequence of historical events that led to (and illustrate) the LDS doctrines that motivated the Lafferty brothers and propelled them to commit their bloody murders.  The second story is the sequence of contemporary events involving the evolution of the Lafferty boys from stalwart priesthood holders in the LDS Church to convicted killers.  Together these stories form a tapestry of mystery and unbridled religious fanaticism woven together.  <br />Among the more interesting aspects of his book (for me, anyway) are Krakauer's reflections on the nature of religious beliefs that lead to violence, and the story he tells of the conviction of the Lafferty brothers at the hands of an LDS prosecutor.  <br />Anyone interested in the power of religion over the minds of men and women will want to read this book, as well as anyone wanting a different perspective on the violent history of the LDS Church.  Hats off to Krakauer for a most readable and captivating tale.	2004-06-17
US	53038410	RWWLYA5CZ4XN5	1410753840	434366122	Farewell to Eden: Coming to terms with Mormonism and Science	Books	5	214	255	N	N	From the author	Having been raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and active for most of my life, I grew up accepting the teachings of my elders, comfortable in the belief that the doctrines of the Church were sound.  Indeed, I was assured that science had all but proven the validity of key LDS theology, and that Mormons are the most scientific people on earth. <br />Imagine my surprise upon finding out they were wrong.  <br />This is a story of discovery and of finding the freedom to think for one's self.  It's my story.  I'm the author, and I wrote it for two reasons.  First, I wrote it as a way of validating the greatest life decision I've ever made - the decision to leave Mormonism.  Mormonism is far more than a religion.  It's a fraternity, too, where loyalty is prized and disloyalty punished.  By leaving I'm now branded a &quot;son of perdition,&quot; and the label has cost me some of my dearest friendships.   <br />Secondly, I've written for other Mormons (or investigators) who may be puzzling over the same questions that plagued me.  There is a simple solution to the intellectual conundrum, but it isn't what the &quot;brethren&quot; tell you.  I hope these pages can give you some comfort in knowing your concerns are not the product of faithlessness, but that of an inquiring mind.    <br />Because this is such an emotionally charged subject, I've described my personal experience growing up in the LDS Church, which is the subject of the entire first chapter.  After introducing you to my background I next discuss a little LDS history and a lot more about what constitutes Mormon doctrine.  I've looked especially at how members of the church arrive at collective doctrines, how they perceive public preaching by their leaders, and church views on prophecy, authority, and revelation. <br />Even though our culture couldn't exist without the benefits of science, many people are unfamiliar with the way science works and its philosophical underpinnings.  Since my book is about the ways in which Mormonism conflicts with science, I've also included a chapter on the subject of science, describing what it is, what is isn't, and illustrating how it works with a few simple examples.<br />The real meat of the book starts after I've described my personal background (and unavoidable biases) and the chapters on &quot;What is Mormonism&quot; and &quot;What is science.&quot;  I begin with the most spectacularly successful scientific theory in history - quantum mechanics.  Though many Mormons are probably unaware of the issues here, quantum mechanics holds real problems for Joseph Smith's unique doctrine that God is a resurrected, glorified, and physical man, and that he also knows everything - past, present, and future. To help make the subject more tractable I begin with a section that clearly delineates Mormon doctrine on the subject, followed by a second section describing the relevant science.  The chapter ends by comparing and contrasting the two.  I've used this general outline throughout the other chapters, too, and I hope the result is a book that's not only a helpful reference guide on Mormonism, but interesting reading regarding many aspects of modern science as well.<br />One of the things I hope you learn from reading my book is the impressive scope of scientific theories that are in direct conflict with Mormon doctrine.  In the remaining chapters I describe conflicts between Mormonism and geology, astronomy, physics, and anthropology.  These conflicts arise in such diverse LDS doctrines as the notion that earth once orbited near a distant star named Kolob, and only recently took up its place in the solar system after Adam fell.  Other problematic LDS doctrines include the universal flood (which, of course, isn't limited to just Mormonism), anti-evolution scriptures and prophetic proclamations, and the notion that the ancient Americans are Hebrews who arrived from the Old World a scant 2600 years ago.<br />I've also includedsome material in the appendix that I hope you find interesting and useful.  For example, there's a short analysis of the statistical distribution of month-dates in the Book of Mormon that strongly suggest it's a fabrication.  And there's a decent index that'll hopefully help you look up subjects long after you've read it.   <br />In writing my book I not only wanted to make clear the existence of conflicts between Mormonism and science, I wanted to express my feeling regarding why these problems are significant and what might be done about them.  That's the subject of my last chapter, which describes the importance of not allowing a religion's myths to become so important that they drown out the ethical and moral aspects that really should be the primary focus. <br />Best regards,<br />Duwayne Anderson	2004-01-30
US	53038410	RCFAVALEGPMUQ	0465019285	479300749	Signs Of Life: How Complexity Pervades Biology	Books	5	17	17	N	N	Order for free	If you've ever been in a traffic jam, chances are, you've also engaged in a coordinated, complicated activity with other drivers - without even knowing about it.  They are called traffic density waves.  How can that be?  How can you engage in large-scale behavior and not know it?  It happens because of emergent behavior that results from simple algorithms in our driving.  It happens to you, just like it happens to ants, bees, and termites.  These simple rules result in unexpected, large-scale order.  It's what Sole and Goodwin would call &quot;order for free.&quot;<br />Sole and Goodwin begin with one of the best introductory summaries that I've seen of simple chaotic behavior in nonlinear systems.  The interesting thing about these systems is the way in which complicated behavior results from repetition and feedback using simple rules.  <br />Later descriptions of biological systems carry this theme forward, and constitute some of the most interesting reading in this book.  For example, in the chapter on &quot;Ants, Brains, and Chaos,&quot; the authors describe a model that simulates the raiding patterns of army ants.  Observing these insects from a distance, one might be inclined to wonder at the appearance of a  higher purposeful component to the movement of colony.  With simulations, however, the authors have argued convincingly that the basic patterns seen in the foraging of army ants result from relatively simple algorithms built into the individual insects.  These simple algorithms, at the individual level, result in large-scale behavior that has no obvious causal connection to the algorithms that are their cause.  <br />A similar chapter on the human brain helps us see that our own intelligence is most likely the amazing consequence of emergent behavior resulting from the interconnections and interactions of an unimaginable  number of connected neurons in our brains.  As such, it begins to make sense that what we call &quot;ourselves&quot; is really an emergent property of cells that is as unrelated to individual members as the marauding patterns of army ants is to the simple algorithms operating on the level of individual insects.<br />Yet another fascinating example from the insect world is that of mound-building termites and nest-building wasps like those that infest my barn each year.  Again, with computer simulations, the authors illustrate that beautiful wasp-like nests can be created using automata with simple algorithms that belie the complexity of the structures that emerge from groups operating under simple rules.  <br />After reading page after page of examples, one begins to get the sense that self organization is a rule of nature.  It seems to be everywhere - almost to the degree that we might marvel when it does not appear.  This, I believe, is one of the underlying messages in &quot;Signs of Life:&quot; That the order and complexity we perceive is actually the result of simpler algorithms operating in (mostly nonlinear) systems with feedback.   That there is a broad range of emergent properties that can, and often do, result from such systems.  The authors also argue against the idea that all this complexity is directly encoded in the DNA of organisms.  Instead, the organism must encode only the simpler rules of engagement (rules like: 1.  smell a pheromone? 2. Dropt the dung) and that the complexity results as &quot;order for fee&quot; through the naturally occurring emergent property of nonlinear systems.<br />Later chapters describe life as being an emergent property on the edge of chaos.  There is lots of interesting information here, relating to evolutionary biology and describing how &quot;the edge of chaos&quot; facilitates evolution, and can result in wildly unpredictable outcomes.  This part of the book also has worrisome implications for public policy.  For example, here in Oregon, the Federal administration recently decided that too much analysis was going into wildlife management.  So they decided to cut through the red tape, ignore biologists, and limit water flows in the Lower Klamath drainage basin.  <br />Sole and Goodwin would argue that complex biological systems are very complex, and that their response to sudden changes in conditions can result in wildly unpredictable outcomes.  We saw that here in Oregon, recently, as tens of thousands of fish died.  Biologists attribute this disaster to parasites that live naturally in the water at all times.  However, the lowered flows, and higher temperatures, in the river stressed the fish and pushed them closer together.  The weakened fish were subsequently more prone to infection, and the closer proximity facilitated dispersal of the disease.  The population reached a subsequent threshold where an epidemic ensued, killing a significant fraction of the fish, and putting people's lives in turmoil who depended on the fish for their livelihoods.<br />This example illustrates the problems and dangers inherent in managing wildlife populations.  Though bearcats may yearn for simple solutions, these systems are, in fact, complex.  Simplistic thinking and/or the inability to engage in sophisticated modeling and prediction can result in disasters.  This is as true for the Klamath River basin as it is for Earth's climate and the likely effects of widespread pollution from gases that trap heat near the earth, and raise the global temperature.<br />This is not an easy book to read.  It has many equations, and much of the mathematics is non-trivial and involves concepts from nonlinear systems that many readers may not be familiar with.  Other terminology in the book is equally aimed at people who already have some exposure to the science at hand.  I hope that does not dissuade you.  Often, the mathematical details can be skipped (though you will miss some of the most interesting stuff that way).  And a dictionary can help you with unfamiliar terminology.  Just be aware that this book will demand more of your intellectual capacity than the typical science book that's been written for the arm-chair scientists.  But I think it's worth it.  I certainly enjoyed it.	2002-10-15

Like Kaplan, Barrow's book begins with ancient concepts about zero, and how different civilizations struggled with the idea that there can be &quot;nothing.&quot;  From the first few chapters in Barrow's book you get an appreciation for much effort has gone into making out counting system and numerical symbols useful, and how awkward earlier methods really were.  And, you get an appreciation for how difficult the concept of nothing really is.  <br />Today, we are accustomed to thinking about nothing, and I'm not sure the average person gives it much thought.  It's a testament to the power of early teaching/indoctrination that concepts that earlier were so profoundly considered are, today, so easily taken for granted.  For example, figure 1.27 in Barrow's book shows a complicate diagram with 19 interrelated blocks illustrating how various concepts are associate with different aspects of nothingness in early Indian thought, ultimately culminating in the mathematical zero.<br />Keep in mind that this is a book about nothing.  And there is more than one nothing to consider.  One view is the mathematical zero.  Closely related to the concept of zero is idea of a vacuum.  Aristotle defined the vacuum as &quot;that in which the presence of a body is possible, although not actual.&quot;  Aristotle believed that the vacuum was logically inconsistent with the universe, and his opposition strongly affected Medieval philosophers.  One of the most interesting sections of Barrows book, for me, were the inventive methods examined by Medieval scientists in their attempts to create the vacuum.  <br />Barrow covers a wide range of ideas associated with the concept of nothing.  Nothing is more than just space where there is no body.  There are also interesting ideas in mathematics.  For example, Barrow describes Godel's theorem, which proves that &quot;there are statements of arithmetic that can be made using the rules and symbols of arithmetic which it is impossible to show to be ether true or false using those rules.&quot;  In other words, the set of all mathematical systems in which every true or false statement made in those systems can be proven using the rules and symbols of the system is zero.  <br />Chapter three is a very interesting discussion about the search for the vacuum.  This story begins in Medieval Europe, but it continues today with our evolving understanding about what a vacuum really is.  Some of the instruments used in the construction of a vacuum are quite inventive, like Torricelli's barometer and different configurations with sliding plates.  I have to admit, though, that some of the Medieval arguments about nothing are hard to follow.  Consider this one, by Von Guericke:  &quot;everything is in Nothing and if God should reduce the fabric of the world, which he created, into Nothing, nothing would remain of its place other than Nothing (just as it was before the creation of the world), that is, the Uncreated.&quot;<br />A very pleasant surprise in Barrow's book is one of the best short histories of the theory of relativity.  It began, of course, with the Ether, and attempts to find it.  The defining test was the Michelson-Morley experiment.  In many text books this experiment is almost a footnote, but Barrow devotes many pages to it.  It's easy to forget, in out modern day of lasers and such, how difficult some of these experiments were to do.  The Michelson-Morley experiment was on the cutting edge of science, and was suggested, on the basis of testing the speed of light in orthogonal directions on a moving earth, by non other than James Clerk Maxwell.  Accomplishing the experiment was monumental both as experimental science, and for the results - or, more accurately, lack of results - obtained by it.  With the Michelson-Morley experiment, the Ether was dead.<br />This is a free-wheeling book that touches more concepts and ideas than any short review can cover.  There are short forays into pure mathematics, with a wonderful picture in figure 5.3 showing the structure of modern mathematics, and the &quot;development of different types of structure.&quot;  I felt lost.  And there are important details like &quot;there is ... a real and precise difference between the number zero and the concept of a set that possesses no members - the null, or empty set.&quot;<br />And that's just the first half of Barrow's book. <br />The second half deals mostly with issues of cosmology, the nature of the vacuum, and the origin of the universe.  With the advent of quantum mechanics, we've come to understand that the location of matter is determined by probability waves.   Modern ideas have evolved to conceive of the vacuum as the lowest possible energy level.  But even here, there are interesting questions that lead to surprises.  <br />The concept I find most interesting is that the universe, itself, has zero net energy.  That is, if you add all the energy in the universe (and energy comes in both positive and negative varieties) it sums to zero, leaving us with the rather profound possibility that nothing is all there really is.<br />This is easily one of the most interesting, versatile, far-reaching, and thought-provoking books I've read in a long time.  Thank you, Mr. Barrow, for writing such an interesting book about Nothing.	2002-08-30
US	53038410	R1IOYVOY4WEE3Z	0521318459	775067707	The Quantum Universe	Books	5	138	143	N	N	Quantum effects are all around us	When you think about quantum physics, you may be inclined to think small.  Many people naturally think that quantum effects happen only on a scale that, for most of us, isn't relevant.  Hey and Walters, though, help us think again.  Quantum effects are in the world all around us.  Indeed, the universe would be very different if the rules of quantum mechanics were not what they are.<br />The stated purpose of this book is to \\"present the essential ideas of quantum physics as simply as possible and demonstrate how quantum physics affects us all.\\"  After reading the book, I have to agree that Hey and Walters have succeeded on both accounts.  They've achieved their goal by laying the book out in a careful and logical manner, including filling it with lots of informative and nicely made illustrates (on average, more than one for each page).  <br />The book begins by discussing the classical differences between waves and particles.  Most of us have been introduced to quantum mechanics this way.  First learning how quantum-mechanical objects act like \\"particles\\" some of the time, and \\"waves\\" part of the time.  An important point made by the authors is that particles and waves are idealizations.  In reality, quantum-mechanical objects cannot be described by any simple picture.  Overcoming this conceptual obstacle is one of the first challenges for someone who is first becoming acquainted with QM.   This is a point made by their careful discussion about the results and implications of double-slit experiments.  <br />This book has equations.  Not many, and not too difficult (mostly just algebra).  It's really written at a High School or Freshman College level.  The ideas introduced are mostly qualitative.  I think this makes the book an excellent introduction.  I certainly wish I'd had something like this before taking my first QM class.  Having a qualitative and conceptual understanding before diving into the mathematics is a more productive approach.  <br />Leaving the chapter on waves and uncertainty, the authors introduce the reader to the weird world of the uncertainty principle, which is the strange characteristic of quantum-mechanical objects that they don't actually have an exact position/velocity until it's measured.  There's an excellent series of photographs that illustrate the uncertainty principle in a macroscopic object by using a sequence showing the probabilistic formation of a camera image over time.  The book quotes often from Richard Feynman, and this chapter has an introductory description of Feynman's diagrams/quantum paths.<br />These discussions lead naturally to the Schrodinger equation and matter probability waves.  Again, there's a little mathematics here (the differential equation for a particle moving in one dimension, in a potential).  The authors illustrate the tie-in with the macroscopic world by illustrating a photograph of some dust mites, made by using the quantum-mechanical nature of electrons.<br />Chapter 4 is one of the best, in my opinion.  It's about the structure of atoms.  When this subject was first introduced to me over 35 years ago, the explanation faltered and it took several more years before I felt comfortable in my understanding.  How I wish I'd had this book then.  The explanation here is crisp and clear, and does a nice job of explaining the notation used for the different quantum-energy levels and how they relate to things like the angular momentum.<br />How atoms are made affects our everyday lives.  The fact that bosons and fermions have different statistical distributions makes a huge difference in how macroscopic objects behave.  In fact, we would probably not be alive to notice how different the universe would be without these specific characteristics at the quantum level.  One of the best examples is found in the life sequence of stars, where the quantum-mechanical structure of stars is inherently related to their evolution.  There's an excellent chapter in this book that describes how stars work, how they are born, what makes them shine, and how they die.  In each step, the laws of quantum mechanics govern the evolutionary process. <br />Other topics covered include superconductivity, superfluidity, Feynman diagrams, Hawking radiation and black holes, the weak and strong forces, the Higgs vacuum, particle accelerators, lasers, monopoles, and quark confinement.  The book also has several informative appendixes in the back, that supply additional mathematical information, including a simple solution to the Schrodinger equation.<br />This book is a little like Chandrasekhar's book \\"Why Things Are the Way They Are,\\" with a touch of the flavor found in Sam Trieman's book \\"The Odd Quantum.\\"  Both of these other books are among my favorite introductory texts, and \\"The Quantum Universe\\" sits on my bookshelf next to them.  <br />This is a well-written book that makes an excellent introduction for students, and enjoyable leisure reading by scientists and engineers who've already had a college class in quantum mechanics.  The illustrations and photographs add to the expressive and clear writing style to make this a book I can heartily recommend	2002-08-30

It's easy to read in the airport, or the plane, it's small, it's paperback, and it's got enough intellectual validity to it that I don't feel like I'm vegetating or wasting my time.<br />Before reading this book, pay close attention to the subtitle: &quot;A natural history of zero.&quot;  That's important in understanding what this book is about.  I hadn't looked closely enough when I picked it up.  I'd expected it to be more along the lines of Paul J. Nahin's book &quot;An imaginary tale: the story of root -1.&quot;  A quick flip through the book was enough to show it didn't have Nahin's load of equations, but still, I was expecting more of a math book than a history book.  <br />This is mostly a history book.  It contains several different chapters that describe how ancient people first came to conceptualize the concept of zero, or nothing.  This idea was wrapped up in many different cultural/religious customs/superstitions/traditions that resulted in some cultures embracing the idea, while others shunned it and only accepted it later.  Often, those who rejected, and then accepted the notion of zero did so out of shear practicality because of the numerical utility of the concept in keeping track of the sale and distribution of goods.  Often this was accompanied by the gradual reinterpretation of religious notions.<br />This process of accepting zero as a number was often an evolutionary one.  As Kaplan says: &quot;despite its power to extend the empire of numbers, we have yet to see zero treated as a number itself.  It evolved from a punctuation mark and long kept its supernumerary character - no more a number than a comma is a letter.&quot;  <br />This is an excellent book for anyone who might take our system of numbers and counting for granted.  Kaplan includes several examples of ancient counting systems - without zero - and shows how painfully difficult those systems were for solving even simple problems.  For example, &quot;Roman-style counting confused the issue, since there was no year zero between 1 BC and 1 AD; hence millennialists had to reckon then - as they do now - with the difficulty that years ending in zero were the last of their decade, century, or millennium,  not the first of the next...&quot;  <br />The book isn't just history. There are lots of practical and interesting discussions about zero as they apply to mathematics, too. There are some fun and interesting graphical examples pertaining to concepts from calculus toward the books end.<br />Not exactly light reading, and not too heavy, either.  But definitely interesting reading, I very much enjoyed this book, and recommend it enthusiastically.	2002-08-30

This is one of the most interesting books I've read in a while, about a subject that is both difficult and strange.  The concept of quantum gravity rests on the notion that space is quantized.  Quantization has been around for a long time.  The Greeks established the idea of quantized atoms of matter - the concept that matter could be divided only a finite number of times.  Most of us are accustomed, at some level or another, to the idea that you can divide elements down to atoms, and no further (they lose their elemental properties if you do).  <br />But how about space?  Is it continuous?  Can it be subdivided to any arbitrary level?  Is there a minimum increment in space?  And how about time?  Is there a smallest increment of time?  According to Smolin (and quite a few other scientists) the answer is yes to both questions, and such quantization is fundamental to the concept of quantum gravity.  To me, it seems at once both strange and common sense.  <br />When I took physics in High School, Mr. Lewis once asked (philosophically); \\"what is time?\\"  I replied that it's what defines motion.  The answer came across, I'm afraid, somewhat flippantly,  but I've considered it more seriously over the years and wondered what a universe without motion would really look like.  Would there be time in such a universe?  Would it even make sense to talk about time if there was no motion - no events - taking place?  I've wondered if, at some level, we can understand the motion of particles in their zero state as a requirement that time cannot stop.  Of course, this motion is also understood as a consequence of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  Is there a relationship?  <br />Smolin takes the point of view that time and space are sequences.  Processes, in his words.  Linkages.  He introduces the concepts found in general relativity and quantum theory that there is no \\"space\\" that is independent of the observer, but only observers that are an integral part of space.  Thus, we cannot talk about a separate space and time, but only of a universe in which we are part of the process.  Consider the following, from his book:<br />\\"time and causality are synonymous.  There is no meaning to the past of an event except the set of events it will influence.\\" <br />\\"One cannot talk meaningfully about the existence of any object or the truth of any statement without completely specifying the questions that are to be asked.\\"  <br />\\".... Our world cannot be understood as a collection of independent entities living in a fixed, static background of space and time.  Instead, it is a network of relationships the properties of every part of which are determined by its relationships to the other parts.\\"<br /> \\"if we look finely enough at our world the continuity of space and time will dissolve as surely as the smoothness of materials gives way to the discrete world of molecules and atoms.\\"<br />As you can see, the book takes a high-level, qualitative, and philosophical approach.  This makes it a bit difficult to make the mental bridge to understanding specific issues with the different theories Smolin discusses.  Part of the problem is an unspoken understanding among Physicists that a theory is essentially a mathematical construct, and that even though you might write the equations of the theory, you may have no idea what they say.  This is a concept that's probably new for many non-physicists, and I think it would be a good idea in a book such as Smolin's to discuss the situation a little bit.  This might involve writing a few equations, like the Lagrangian for a four-body system.  I know publishers don't like to use equations (and I disagree strongly with them over this point) but the theories of quantum gravity are mathematical, and the problems with understanding them cannot really be approached without explaining some of these characteristics.  Otherwise, the author runs the hazard of saying things like \\"we don't really understand what the theory is telling us\\" and someone from the life sciences wondering why on earth a scientist does not understand her own theory.<br />The book's high-level discussion includes M-theory (string theory), loop quantum gravity, and the holographic principle, complete with Smolin's conjectures (at the end of the book) about how the story will unfold.  <br />Smolin made me sit up and think, and I like that in a book.  But the book is also written at the 50,000-foot level, and that made it somewhat frustrating.  I'd like to understand Smolin's concepts at a more quantitative level, but don't really want to invest the time required to comprehend the full mathematical theory.  I kept wishing there was some middle ground, but never found it.<br />Those issues aside, Smolin's book is worth reading.  I'm glad I did.	2002-08-16
US	53038410	RPUP1E8ZT998O	0878424156	924650929	Glacial Lake Missoula and Its Humongous Floods	Books	4	19	27	N	N	Must-know geology for anyone living in the Pacific Northwest	I picked up this book while touring the visitor's center at the Grand Coulee Dam in Washington State, on the way home from camping in the Canadian Rockies.  In spite of having grown up in Washington State, I'd never seen the Grand Coulee before, and thought it was about time.  Besides, the kids thought it would be a treat.<br />The Grand Coulee dam sits in a wide, deep channel, or coulee, in the Eastern Washington basalt.  David Alt's book is relevant because it explains (among lots of other things) where the coulee (and others like it) originated.  The story begins with early settlers, who wondered at the scab lands in the area, and their contrast with the rich soils of the Palouse Hills.  Some of these scab lands show stream beds much too wide to support current flows, and scouring as much as several hundred feet above the current channels.  There are also potholes in the coulees, very numerous, and some of gigantic proportions.  Further north, in Montana, there are the unmistakable horizontal lines of ancient lake shores, high on the hills and mountains of river valleys.<br />These and other clues led early geologists to wonder and speculate about ancient glacial lakes during the last ice age.  T. C. Chamberlain was one of these, as was Joseph Pardee, who actually calculated the volume of water in what is now called Glacial Lake Missoula.  The numbers are impressive.  The lake held roughly 500 cubic miles of water, was nearly 2000 feet deep, and covered an area of roughly 2,900 square miles.  <br />The problem was, it was all held back by an ice dam, an ice finger, actually, from one of the glaciers that moved down from Canada during the last ice age.  And when the water in the lake became deep enough to float the ice dam, it gave way, resulting in a tremendous rush of water out of the lake that sloshed its way, making temporary lakes as it went, all the way to the Pacific ocean.<br />Along the way, this great flood formed many of the features we see in Montana,the Idaho panhandle, Easter Washington, the Columbia Gorge, and the lower Columbia.  Alt has structured his book so that he takes the reader on a voyage from the lake's beginnings in Montana through the river valleys the flood scoured.  Along the way he explains how the floods resulted in landmarks easily visible from interstate highways, including such features as Coeur d'Alane Lake in Idaho, the scablands and coulees of Eastern Washington, the Columbia River Gorge, and Lake Oswego in Oregon.  <br />The book is nicely illustrated, with lots of black-and-white photographs of geological features as well as useful maps.  The story, for the most part, is sequential, and follows the events of the flood from the moment the ice dam broke.  An important point, though, is that there were many such floods.  Perhaps three dozen or more.  This cyclic behavior resulted from the creeping ice: as soon as the ice dam washed out, the glacial ice, continuing it's plodding movement, would begin damming the river again, and the process would repeat.  <br />Alt's purpose in writing the book is to both tell the story of geological events, as well as to illustrate how scientists grapple \\"with an emerging scientific controversy.\\"  As he points out, \\"[S]ome handle it well, others miserably as personalities, pride, and outright prejudice supercede scientific evidence.  While I found some of these stories interesting, for me they were a little distracting, particularly when Alt takes the apparent point of view that earlier scientists who did not readily accept the \\"monster-flood theory\\" were somehow bad scientists.    <br />For example, Alt states on page 21: <br />\\"When J. Harlen Bretz first proposed his great flood, he could not say where the water had come from.  He pointed to the enormous expanse of glaciated country to the north and vaguely suggested that the water had come from somewhere up there, somehow.  Perhaps a brief interlude of much warmer weather melted an enormous amount of ice.  Maybe a volcano erupted beneath the ice.  It was a puzzle.  People need not understand everything they know.  It is perfectly proper in scientific discussions to recognize that a phenomenon exists without being able to explain it.\\"<br />In hind site it's easy to criticize people for not \\"believing.\\"  But Alt does a disservice, I think, with his implications that such criticisms were somehow unfair.  No doubt there were personal conflicts and bad manners, but overall, my perception is that the scientific community was pretty prompt about accepting the new theory once the evidence was presented.  And, certainly, the cause of science is not advanced by accepting uncritically ideas for which only ad hoc explanations about \\"where all the water came from\\" are advanced.  One need only review the circumstances surrounding the fiasco of \\"cold fusion\\" to understand the value in the scientific method of \\"believing\\" after the facts are established, and not before.<br />Philosophical issues aside, I really enjoyed this book.  It's part of a class of books aimed at the intelligent arm-chair scientist (but of interest, I believe, to \\"real\\" scientists, as well) in which a particular geological micro-history is traced through thousands of years.  For me, personally, this was a fun book.  I enjoy geology, and I especially enjoy such books that take a particular historical event in geology and explain it in detail.  It's the sort of book I can easily read while camping, or in the evening, at home.   I highly recommend it.	2002-08-14
US	53038410	R1Z90TNL7NA2C9	0738204897	697514957	Supersymmetry: Unveiling The Ultimate Laws Of Nature	Books	3	3	5	N	N	More specific details would have made it better	Supersymmetry is a particular mathematical extension of the standard model in which the equations predict additional things like superpartners.  Kane's book, obviously, is about supersymmetry, including some of its historical origins and what it might teach us about the universe.<br />One of the questions readers might ask is what difference does supersymmetry make?  Is it just a particularly nice way of writing the equations of the standard model?  Kane does a nice job of explaining these differences, and helping the reader understand how supersymmetry, as a theory, can be tested.  <br />For example, the Standard Model predicts something called the Higgs boson.  The exact number of Higgs bosons, and their characteristics, will help shape the Standard Model.  If it turns out that supersymmetry describes nature, we should find that there are at least five types of Higgs bosons.<br />Kane has included an entire chapter on the subject of testing supersymmetry.  One of the nice things about his chapter is the way in which he explains how beam intensity affects the determination of a theories viability.  Often, it's not just a matter of finding some new particle, but of observing processes with different decay products at different rates.  This is where intensity comes in, as it allows a faster acquisition of the statistics to distinguish between different models.  In other words, a collider's usefulness depends on more than the energy of the colliding particles.  It also depends on things like how many particles are in the colliding beams (the intensity).<br />Kane also does a nice job of explaining - at the beginning of the book - the hierarchy among models and theories, though he brings (of course) a distinct theoretical-physicist point of view.  <br />Kane's book is totally qualitative, and intended for the general public.  That's not necessarily a bad thing.  Generally I enjoy books that address cutting-edge research at the 50,000-foot level where you don't have tobe an &quot;expert&quot; to follow the mathematics.  Such books make me feel like I'm still using my time wisely, even though the book is &quot;easy reading.&quot;  <br />Unfortunately, I think Kane's book is a bit too qualitative.  I realize that a subject like supersymmetry is very complicated, and that a 200-page book with no equations can hardly hope to give the subject justice, but this level was just a tad bit too general for me.  There just isn't that much solid and clear information that I could grab hold of here, and I came away feeling (unfortunately) like I hadn't learned as much as I'd hoped to.<br />The book definitely has its good side.  Kane is a talented writer, and he does a good job of explaining concepts about theories and models in physics.  What he does explain is - for the most part - clear and easy to follow and understand.  <br />For example, Kane points out that the superpartners predicted by supersymmetry could help to explain the missing mass of the universe (mass that is known to exist from the gravitational maps produced by the measuring the motions of stars, but not visibly detected).  These superpartners interact through fields that don't act on normal matter - except for the Higgs boson (which is responsible for giving particles mass).  It was not clear for me, though, why this has to be so.  That's part of the problem.  Kane provides a fair amount of information, but much of it takes the form of simple statements thrown out, without the ability to see how these things are required as part of the theory.  For every explanation, it seems, I found myself with a dozen more questions. <br />Some of the side discussions in this book are quite interesting, like the discussion about the search for the Higgs boson, some of the commentary about the origin of the universe, and the missing mass (already mentioned above).  I got the feeling that the book was written at a level appropriate for (and possibly intended for) politicians and administrators responsible for funding the colliders necessary to search for the superpartners.  Indeed, one of the most interesting parts of the book was the discussion about Fermilab and CERN, and how each is engaged in research in modern physics.<br />Some of the most interesting stuff is actually in the appendices, which you will definitely want to read.  There is also a useful glossary and adequate index.	2002-06-14
US	53038410	R3QLHBYJQE6OX0	0395955637	604856199	Time Travel in Einstein's Universe: The Physical Possibilities of Travel Through Time	Books	4	10	13	N	N	The picture on the cover is what�s important	Gott's book is a typical physicist's commentary, with a few unique twists.  One of the first things Gott does is explain the logic of time travel.  This is important, and helps to dispel some possibly incorrect ideas that might be popularly held.  <br />Clearly, time travel is possible.  We all do it as part of our normal existence.  What's implied by the phrase \\"time travel\\" is the ability to control the pace; to move through time as freely as we move through space.  Gott shows that we can move forward in time at different rates.  The trick here, of course, is to use velocity and/or gravitational fields.  This is a well-established experimental fact of relativity.    <br />Okay.  So we can adjust our forward speed through time.  But can we go in reverse?  This seems to have a few more problems with it, like apparent paradoxes.  For example, suppose I go back in time and kill myself as a little child.  Then what?  Gott would argue that that would be impossible.  It looks like a paradox only because I assume sufficient free agency.  Or, Gott might argue that the world in which I kill myself as a little child is a parallel universe.  One in which there are parallel \\"me's\\" and \\"you's\\" and that I can only travel backward in time to those parallel universes, and not the one in which I actually live.  <br />At any rate, the point of the first part of Gott's book is to convince us that unorthodox time travel really is possible - both at different forward rates, and in reverse.  <br />Things get weirder.  Next, Gott introduces us to wormholes and cosmic strings.  This part is very interesting, but in reading it all, I had to be careful not to forget exactly what Gott is talking about.  Want to travel backward in time?  No problem.  Just get two cosmic strings that are really, *really* long (and massive) and move them toward each other at nearly the speed of light.  Then get in your space ship and zing around the moving cosmic strings: and there you have it - you move backward in time.  To be fair, Gott reminds us frequently that this is something that only a very advanced civilization could do.  One that could command the energy of an entire galaxy.  Personally, I think Gott is optimistic.  <br />One of the things that I wish Gott had discussed relates to questions about conservation of mass/energy in time travel to the past.  If I'm sitting at my desk, and suddenly my future self appears, then it looks like about 70 kg of mass has suddenly been created.  That's roughly equal to 1.7*10^18 Joules.  A ton of TNT is equivalent to about 4.1*10^9 Joules, so we are talking about the energy of roughly 1,500 1-megaton bombs.  That's a lot of energy.  Since all this time travel takes place in space, a space craft of some sort is required.  The mass energy now looks like hundreds of thousands of 1-megaton bombs.  Since no machine is ever 100% efficient, if this time-travel to the past was even 99.9999% efficient, the resulting time traveler would arrive in the past as an explosive event that would blow himself (and a lot of other folks) to smithereens.   It occurred to me that this might make the foundation for a good science fiction story.  Perhaps the 1921 explosion over northern Russia was actually a time traveler whose machine turned out to be only 99.9999% efficient.  <br />In my opinion, the best part of this book is near the end, where Gott explains the beginning of time: there isn't any.  The universe, instead, exists as space-time that closes back on itself (that's the picture on the front cover).  This, to me, seems like a very appealing view. We've long since come to accept a finite space with no beginning or end.  A space that curves back on itself.  The surface of our planet does this, and the universe probably does, too.  What could be more natural, then, than a four-dimensional space-time universe that does the same thing?<br />Gott has written a very good book.  The only bad chapter is, unfortunately, the last.  This one digresses and gets mired down in the Copernican principle, which states that we are not \\"special,\\" and that we are most likely to understand the universe by assuming that the view we see is not privileged.  This is a sound scientific principle that has guided much of the most successful science of the last several hundred years.  Unfortunately, Gott violates it while trying to use it to support human colonies on Mars.  <br />Gott's idea is to use the Copernican principle to show that our species has, at most, a few million years to survive, and then to argue that we must disperse throughout the cosmos, with a first stop as settlers on Mars to reduce our chances of going extinct.  In doing this, however, Gott tacitly assumes that we *are* \\"special,\\" and that our \\"special\\" ability to build rocket ships and colonize other planets somehow gives us a survival advantage.  <br />Gott seems to have the mistaken idea that intelligence offers enhanced survival abilities beyond the normal 11-million-or-so years.  But is this true?  We make nuclear weapons, biological agents, and global weather changes capable of destroying our species.   Sharks, on the other hand, have limited intelligence, and bacteria have virtually no intelligence.  Both have been doing just fine for hundreds of millions of years, while most <BR>\\"intelligent\\" apes (of which our species is just one example) totter near extinction.  <br />In spite of the weak ending, I really liked this book.  It made me sit up and think, and I always appreciate that.  Hats off to Gott for writing what is both entertaining and educational.	2002-05-28

It's been a few years since I graduated from college, and although I use mathematics every day in my work, I've realized, over the years, that I don't use some aspects of mathematics very much (formal proofs, for example) and that I've become a bit rusty in some areas.  Mathematics has always been one of my passions, though, so when I found this book I bought it with the hope that reading it would help me brush up.  I wasn't disappointed.<br />This book is, as the title says, a refresher.  It's intended for the reader who has already complete course work in the material, but wants to review it, or use it possibly as a reference.  Fanchi's book covers most branches of mathematics that the typical undergraduate is likely to encounter, with a few notable exceptions.  There is no discussion about tensors and nothing on things like topology.   The book's chapters follow what is probably the traditional route many of us took in our introduction to mathematics.  The first chapter is a review of algebra, followed by geometry, trigonometry, and hyperbolic functions.  These are followed by analytic geometry, linear algebra, and calculus (broken into chapters dealing with differential calculus, partial derivatives, integrals, and ordinary differential equations).<br />Since this is a refresher book, the author assumes that the reader has already been exposed, either through experience or course work, to the subjects being covered.  So, the material is not introduced the way it typically is found in traditional texts.  There is, for example, relatively little developmental material leading up to key concepts.  This is both expected and appropriate.  <br />The book excels in several areas, including the use of examples, which are found liberally throughout the text.  I highly recommend readers work through these exercises, especially since many of them have solutions that are, themselves, important and useful material.  Each exercise comes complete with worked-out solutions in the back of the book, so if you want, you can use this as a very effective book for self-education, almost as if you were going back to school to take a refresher course.<br />As with any book, reliability and accuracy is critical.  Especially for a reference-type book that you are likely to use when you don't have a lot of time to question, or check, the accuracy of the material.  Fanchi does an excellent job in this regard; I found almost no errors (and none that were serious).  Another thing I look for in a reference book is a good index.  I know that the next time I pick it up, it'll be because I remember reading something in it, and I know the answer I'm looking for is in there somewhere, but I cannot remember the page.  The first place I'll go is the index, and with a good one (like the one in Fanchi's book) I should be able to track down the solution without too much wasted time.<br />There were a couple of pleasant surprises in this book.  One was the three chapters on probability and statistics.  The other was the section (in the chapter on ordinary differential equations) dealing with nonlinear dynamics and chaos.  Frankly, I was surprised to see the subject of chaos discussed in this book at all (especially since tensors are not).  My only complaint is that there is not an entire chapter devoted to the subject.<br />The book is easy to read, and well organized.  I found it very enjoyable.  It's the sort of book that you can easily read for an hour, cover 20 or 30 pages, and not feel too exhausted - if, that is, you are reading it as a review.  However, as I said, I'd not recommend this as an introductory text for any of these subjects (and I think the author, by reason of his choice of title, would agree).	2002-05-08

The ants impressed me the most, with their organization and ferocity.  Sometimes I'd play a game to see how long I could hold my hand on the nest.  Caterpillars were another curiosity, with their spines, toxic hairs, and camouflage.  And what kid hasn't had the experience of picking up a lizard or snake, only to find it excreting its feces all over the place, to ward off potential predators?<br />When I saw Levy's book in the bookstore at the University of Washington it caught my attention immediately.  Reading it was like going back in time, to the woods behind our house, where my fascination with animals and their modes of attack and self-defense originated.   Levy's book is for all the kids (including the ones over 30) who find something intriguing about the microscopic kingdoms hidden under a log, or in a pond, and the ferocious battles that are wage there.<br />Evolution wouldn't exist without competition.  The subtitle in Levy's book elaborates on the content: \\"A three-billion-year arms race.\\"  This is a book about plants and animals, and how they evolved to eat and escape from each other.  The ones that are most effective in either evading or executing capture are the ones that propagate their DNA, and the result of this battle of pursuit and escape over the last 2 billion or so years has been some truly amazing life forms, employing some really interesting solutions.<br />Like any good book, Levy begins at the beginning, describing a little about the competition that existed among the very first forms of life on earth.  Throughout the book, Levy describes different dimensions of the conflict.  Some dimensions lead to flight, others to eyes, some to incredible speed and agility, others to stealth, and still others to ears of great acuity.  Many conflicts resulted in chemical defenses.  And some of the most bizarre resulted in camouflage.  <br />A common theme throughout Levy's book is the manner in which evolution, over hundreds of millions of years, has resulted in extraordinarily complicated and refined mechanisms for both defense and attack.  The discussion about bats, for example, describes how these small mammals use their acoustic sonar to track flying insects with the sort of accuracy we (who, by comparison, hardly use our ears at all) can scarcely imagine.  Reading the section on bats, I had to remind myself that, while they do some incredible things with sound, animals with eyes do equally impressive feats with their eyes.  Bats can decipher an incredible amount of information in an unbelievably complex mix of acoustic signals.  Animals with eyes, on the other hand, manage to make sense of a bewildering barrage of electromagnetic radiation, and even discern the tiger in the grass.  It's just that the difference in the evolutionary paths our ancestors took is so incredible that I cannot imagine doing with my ears what comes naturally to those bats with their ears.<br />Levy frequently compares the evolutionarily designed characteristics of animals with what we see in modern war machines.  The flying bat, for example, hones in on its prey with far greater efficiency and accuracy than any guided missile.  The chemical sensors in the noses of many animals are sensitive to an extraordinary degree.  Some fish bring down flying insects by spitting water at them.  To make the kill, they have to account for relative motion, and parabolic flight of the water drops.  Other fish (the Anableps dowi) spend a lot of time near the surface of the water.  To search for objects in both the water and the air, they have to account for the difference in the index of refraction in the air, and under water.  The solution?  They have evolved two eyes: one for seeing above water, and one for seeing below.<br />Of the many features in this book, some of the best are the many excellent black-and-white line drawings.  The book is full of them (they average about every other page).  It's also wellwritten, and has a generous index.  The subject matter is what captured me, though.  If you are someone who finds fascination in the incredible, but possibly little-known facts about animals, especially insects, then I think you will enjoy this book as much as I did.  It certainly kept my attention.  It's one of those books I had difficulty putting down.	2002-05-08
US	53038410	R2PTYITD56NG6W	0393322386	81363125	Did Adam and Eve Have Navels?: Debunking Pseudoscience	Books	5	53	58	N	N	The never-ending battle against pseudoscience	There are certain qualities and characteristics that make a great writer.  One is the ability to write well, of course, but closely related is the ability to convey clear and succinct concepts in a way that communicates with the reader.  The best authors all leave me with that \\"ahah\\" moment, as they teach me something I didn't know before.  <br />For these reasons and others, Martin Gardner is one of my favorite authors.  I've enjoyed his articles over the years, and find his books both refreshing and educational.  This book, \\"Did Adam and Eve have Navels,\\" is consistent with Gardner's reputation as one of the best science and mathematics authors around.<br />Gardner's book consists of a collection of essays (there are 28), each dealing with some aspect of pseudo science (or, in some cases, I'd call it pseudo logic).  The title on the front of the jacket corresponds with the subject matter of the first essay.  There is something about simple questions and observations that fascinates me.  They tend to be overlooked or ignored, but often lead us to deep insights.  In Gardner's first essay, he explores the logic - or lack of it - in the idea of the mythical Adam and Eve and whether they actually had belly buttons.  This seems like a whimsical question, and one probably best forgotten by most people.  The problem is, as Gardner points out, whether you answer the question \\"yes,\\" or \\"no,\\" there are unexpected consequences.  <br />This is pretty much Gardner's style throughout the rest of the book, as he picks off one after the other unsupported idea or myth.  Topics include ideas about intelligent design, egg balancing, numerology, Cannibalism as a myth, Freud, and the Star of Bethlehem.<br />Some of the most interesting stores Gardner tells, and some of the most alarming, are those that deal with pseudo science at the academic level in some of the nations more prestigious universities.  There is the example of Courtney Brown (an associate professor of political scienceat Emory University) who claims to be able to do SRV (scientific remote viewing, which is another word for clairvoyance) and \\"Yogic flying.\\"   His book has received praise from the likes of Harvard psychiatrist John Mack, who believes that aliens from a different dimension are visiting earth, kidnapping its citizens, and doing some really nasty stuff to them.<br />There are also stories about the influence of political extremism on science, including the following statement from ultra feminist Lucy Irigary:<br />\\"Is E=Mc^2 a sexed equation?  Perhaps it is.  Let us make the hypothesis that it is insofar as it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us.  What seems to me to indicate the possibly sexed nature of the equation is not directly its uses by nuclear weapons, rather it is having privileged what goes the fastest ...\\"<br />In addition to these exposed escapades, I think my favorite chapter was number 14, which describes \\"Alan Sokal's Hilarious Hoax.\\"  The hoax was a paper that Sokal submitted to the editors of \\"Social Text,\\" in the Spring/Summer of 1996.  Sokal wrote the paper as a hoax to illustrate the foolish things the journal would print, and their failure to engage in any sort of academically meaningful peer review.  Sokal began his parody by explaining that there really isn't an objective world out there, that can be studied and understood by the scientific method.  As Gardner put it, \\"the funniest part of Sokal's paper is its conclusion that science must emancipate itself from classical mathematics before it can become a \\"concrete tool of progressive political praxis.\\"<br />If these stories didn't portend such dreadful consequences for public policy and science education in America, they'd be so funny you'd hardly be able to stop laughing.  Or crying.  <br />About the only complaint I have with Gardner's book is his tendency to laugh off some of the examples of scientific illiteracy.  For anyone remotely familiar with science, the laughing off is understandable - as in the case of Lucy Irigary calling the equation E=Mc^2 sexed.  The problem is, for those who don't really know much about science (either how it works, or what it says) some of the laughing off might look like pride, or the inability to deal logically with alternative ideas.  <br />To a certain extent, I can understand what Gardner's doing.  Some ideas are simply so absurd as to lack any respect at all.  [And Gardner would point out that the reason they are absurd has to do with their failure to explain the evidence.  So, this is not about pre-conceived perceptions, but about allowing the evidence to lead us to conclusions, instead of following our favorite myths, political convictions, or emotional desires.]  Still, there were times I found myself wishing Gardner would say a little more about why some of the ideas in his examples were silly.  <br />Anyway, I really liked this book.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It's easy to read, well written, and for anyone concerned about the proliferation of pseudoscience in modern society, it's pretty much required reading.	2002-05-03
US	53038410	R3UBX1XPZOUB5E	0824787293	868585803	Polarized Light: Fundamentals and Applications (Optical Engineering, Vol 36)	Books	5	7	7	N	N	An excellent reference book on polarized light	I own a copy of Klinger's book &quot;Polarized Light in Optics and Spectroscopy.&quot;  It's a very useful reference, and I find myself going back to it on an almost daily basis.  I've been pretty satisfied with the information in Klinger's book, but phenomena relating to polarization are very important in my field (fiber optics) and so I decided it made good sense to get a copy of Collett's book, as well.  I've not been disappointed.<br />Collett's book has two parts.  The first part is what I was mostly interested in, and it deals with polarization in the classic optical field.  The second part of the book is less relevant for me, and deals with the classical and quantum theory of radiation by accelerating charges.<br />The prerequisites for reading and understanding this book are pretty basic.  For the first book, you'll want a strong basis in algebra, linear algebra, and trigonometry.  For the second half of the book you'll also want to be versed in things like vector calculus (div, grad, curl, etc.) as well as some integral optics and concepts essential in quantum theory.  Both the mathematics and physics should be easily within the grasp of anyone with a BS in physics or mathematics.  This is not what I'd call a book for the armchair scientists.  It is a specialist's book, with all the detail and mathematics to allow the specialist to do quantitative engineering and science.<br />Collett offers one of the best all-around descriptions of the Mueller matrix that I've found.  The book starts with some background information describing the wave equation, various interference experiments, and reflection and transmission at a dielectric interface.  With this foundational information, he moves on to describe the polarization ellipse, leading naturally to a description of the Stokes polarization parameters.  In all of this, Collett does a nice job of helping the reader understand the basis of the Stokes vector in actual measurements associated with the Stokes parameters, and their fundamental utility and practicality.<br />With the concept of the Stokes parameters established, Collett proceeds to introduce the Muller matrix, and he derives the matrix form for several different optical components such as polarizers, phase plates, and the rotation matrix.  He also has a useful chapter for the experimentalist, describing various techniques for measuring the Stokes parameters of optical components.<br />There is an entire chapter on the derivation of the Mueller matrix of tilted dielectric surfaces.  This discussion carries over into the next chapter where Collett derives the Mueller matrices of plates, and stacks of plates.  [These derivations ignore multiple reflections, though Collett is careful to make this clear, and he provides chapter references where the student can look up the completely correct treatment.]  This chapter has some interesting mathematics that can be quite useful in other polarization work, since it describes the process for linearizing the Mueller matrix in terms of its eigenvectors and eigenvalues (something that makes the analysis of stacks of plates much easier to do).<br />Reading this book, one gets the distinct impression that Collett favors the Muller matrix calculus over the Jones calculus.  Still, he has included a very nice chapter on the Jones matrix calculus that is both relatively complete, as well as written in the same easy-to-understand fashion as the rest of the book.<br />The chapter on the Poincare sphere was not quite what I'd expected, but was still very helpful and interesting.  Be prepared to brush up on your spherical trigonometry when you read this chapter.  I'd hoped for more information from a practical point of view (and a few better illustrations), so this was a bit of a disappointment.  However, there are bits of practical information here, and the beauty of the spherical trigonometry is enough to make the chapter worthwhile on its own.<br />The first book ends with a chapter onthe interference laws of Fresnel and Arago, which seems a little strange.  The chapter seems somewhat out of place, and, perhaps, better suited near the front of the book, though it does provide the opportunity to illustrate some of the principles learned in earlier chapters.<br />Space does not permit a detailed description of the second half of the book (the first half is about 280 pages, and the entire book is roughly 580 pages).<br />This is a first-rate book, and if you are involved in optics and polarization, in particular, you really owe it to yourself to have this one in your personal library.  The book is well written, for the most part, pretty easy to follow (not a small task, given the subject matter), and nicely referenced with additional reading material listed at the end of each chapter.  There is also an adequate index, which is a good thing, since this book will find widespread use as a reference text.<br />I really have only two complaints:  First, the book needs an appendix (like that found in Klinger) listing the different Matrix forms for various optical components.  It would be nice, in addition, to have an appendix listing the definitions of variables used in the equations.  Instead, I have little sticky tape all over the book so I can find my way back to important equations.  There are a few blank pages at the end of the book, so perhaps I'll write my own appendix with these equations.  Secondly, the book has too many typographical errors, some of which can be disastrous if you just copy the equations out of the book without looking at their derivations to check for dropped/misplaced variables.  A second edition with these mistakes corrected, or at least a published erratum would be a good idea.<br />Other than that, this is a great book.  I highly recommend getting it and reading it, if polarized light is something for which you have a quantitative interest.	2002-05-02
US	53038410	R2J5OJKPOCUO4D	0465037402	620502691	Quintessence: The Mystery Of Missing Mass In The Universe	Books	5	29	29	N	N	It's about the missing mass in the universe	Krauss takes his title, \\"Quintessence\\" from ancient concepts about space, and makes the point that some of our concepts have come full circle (though not in ways envisioned by their first proponents).  The subject is the \\"missing mass\\" of the universe.  The universe, of course, is exactly what it is - so there isn't really any \\"missing mass.\\"  What's meant by that phrase is that we know there is more mass in the universe than what we see, and the question is, what is this hidden material?  That might seem like a narrow subject for such a long book, but missing mass, it turns out, has implications for just about everything, from quantum mechanics to the broadest theories of formation of the universe.  <br />For me, the book started off slow.  The first chapter is mostly about ancient notions of the universe, with discussions about Aristotle's aether, and things like that.  This chapter is basically a very short history of science, from earliest concepts through Einstein's development of the theory of relativity, and the demise of the aether.   With the theory of relativity, physics viewed empty space as just that - empty.  The idea of a uniform background of invisible stuff (particles, aether, etc.) lay pretty much discarded.<br />Then we had the beginnings of the modern science of cosmology and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), which has been confirmed as the closest-to-theoretical blackbody radiation source ever discovered.   The CMB is one of the pillars of evidence for the expanding universe and the Big Bang theory of cosmology, and Krauss does a nice job of following the historical and logical sequence of discoveries in its development.  Within the Big Bang theory, the amount of matter in the universe has broad implications for how the universe will continue to evolve, so any \\"missing mass\\" is very important.  Krauss covers these topics in a relatively brief but nicely done chapter on the Big Bang and large-scale structure in the universe.One of the things I like best about this book is the extra bit of detail Krauss offers that is often over looked in other books. The sort of details that help the reader better understand the specifics and particulars that real science is made of.<br />The subjects in this book range from the very large (theories of the evolution of the cosmos) to the very small (concepts and ideas in quantum physics).  For example, there is an early introduction to the concept of virtual particles and the resolution they bring to many different and important calculations in physics.  One of the most important of these is the philosophical problem of action at a distance, which virtual particles solve nicely by providing a mechanism for transferring force from one particle to another.<br />Chapter three was one of the most interesting for me, and marks the beginning of the real meat of the book.  It describes how astronomers weigh the universe.  At first, this can seem either trivial or impossible, depending on your expectations.  On one hand, it seems that all you need do is count stars (not literally, of course, but by measuring an average density and multiplying by total volume) multiply by some sort of average stellar weight, and there you have it.  On the other hand, closer examination begins to show cracks in that method.  What about dim stars?  Gas?  Dust?  Planets?  How much mass do they contribute?  Krauss does an excellent job of pointing out these difficulties, and showing how, one by one, scientists refined their estimates by including more and more candidates for matter in the universe.  It was a monumental task, and Krauss does a nice job of illustrating for the informed layman the incredible intricacies that had to be included in the methods and calculations that went into calculating the amount of barionic matter in the universe. <br />Next, Krauss shows how you can use Newtonian mechanics to predict the amount of mass within a given radius by measuring how fast objects outside the radius orbit the center.  He begins with an example showing the average orbital velocity of the planets as a function of the distance from the sun.  He uses this example to predict the solar mass, and to also illustrate how much (how little, actually) other material besides the planets there is in the solar system.  I find this aspect of science fascinating; how, with some careful observations of lights in the sky, we can infer the amount of mass resulting from countless unseen specs of dust orbiting the sun in an unimaginably large volume of space.<br />The orbital velocities for planets in the solar system fall off rapidly with increasing distance from the sun.  But when we apply these techniques to galaxies, we see something different: the orbital velocities fall off as if there was an invisible halo of mass around them.  Taking the best estimates for matter in a typical galaxy, and measuring the velocities of stars orbiting various galaxies, scientists found that the amount of matter they thought was there is a small percentage of the amount that is inferred by the measured orbital velocities.  This is the origin of the central problem of Krauss' book: the missing mass of the universe.  We know it's there, but what is it?  What is it made of?  If current estimates are correct, it is the dominant source of mass in the universe.  <br />Most of the rest of the book looks at the central question of what the missing matter - called dark matter - is made of.  Along the way Krauss examines possible candidates from neutrinos and WIMPS to vacuum energy.  As I said, this is a nicely written book, and one that wraps a whole lot of information on the universe together.    If you enjoy amateur cosmology (like I do) I think you'll want to read it.	2001-10-26
US	53038410	R27UWT3BYDRTGS	0521654882	903304743	Perils of a Restless Planet: Scientific Perspectives on Natural Disasters	Books	5	7	7	N	N	Interesting stories with the science behind them	I picked up this book while in Cambridge, strolling through one of the bookstores in town.  Thumbing through the pages, it looked like a collection of stories about natural disasters - something I thought would be interesting reading in the evening, after poking around old cathedrals, castles, and local pubs.  Anyway, it was father's day and my wife offered to get it as a present - I gladly accepted and began reading it right away.<br />It wasn't the book I expected.  Sure, it has lots of stories about notable natural disasters, but it's much more than just sensational accounts.  It's actually a well-thought-out science book with some excellent material about the nature of science in general, complete with basic tutorials on such things as strengths of materials, wave propagation, the weather, and chaos.  <br />The book begins with an account of the 1755 disaster that virtually destroyed Lisbon.  The catastrophe consisted of an offshore earthquake that leveled much of the city (especially the un-reinforced buildings of stone masonry) followed by a tsunami and fires that basically destroyed what was left.   This chapter also tells the story of the destruction of Thera (today called Santorin or Santorini) in the Aegean Sea.  This island volcano erupted catastrophically, destroying most of it approximately 1600 B.C.  An interesting part of this story is the conjecture that the catastrophe led to the eventual downfall of the civilization on Crete, not far away.<br />The book then switches modes, temporarily, with a very nice expose on the evolution of science, and what science is.  I especially appreciated Zebrowski's illustration of the basic assumptions in science, and how the philosophy and methods of science have evolved since Aristotle.   <br />Have you ever wondered at the differences in casualties between different cities?  Well, you should.  Zebrowski compares two remarkable catastrophes to make a point.  One was the earthquake that struck San Francisco in 1906,and the other was an earthquake that hit Messina in 1908.  Both earthquakes were of roughly the same magnitude, but the death toll was far greater n Messina than in San Francisco.  The difference?  Construction.  In Messina the buildings were made primarily of un-reinforced stone masonry, while in San Francisco they were mostly made of wood.    This serves as the introduction to a chapter that illustrates many important and basic ideas about the strengths of materials, and how the proper selection of such materials can make tremendous differences in how buildings survive earthquakes.  If you live in earthquake country this chapter will be particularly relevant.<br />One of the things I liked best about this book is how it takes the reader through so many different topics.  There are examples of deep lakes with dissolved carbon dioxide.  When disturbed by something like a landslide, this deep water can be rolled to the surface, and with the pressure released, belches large quantities of carbon dioxide across the countryside.  The carbon dioxide hugs the ground, displacing oxygen and causing death by suffocation.<br />Zebrowski has one of the best basic descriptions of exponential population growth that I've seen, and he follows it up with a real-life example of what happens when human population growth goes unchecked, with the example of Easter Island.  The basic lesson here is that, with rapid doubling times, by the time you realize you have a problem it's probably already out of control.  Quite possibly the greatest threat facing the human race today is our unchecked population growth.  And by the time everyone realizes - or is finally forced to admit - that it's a problem, it could be too late to do much about it.  Every government and religious leader needs to be familiar with the arguments that Zebrowski puts forward in this chapter.<br />There are too many other examples to go into much detail.  Zebrowski discusses things like evolution, and how natural disasters affect the evolution (and extinction) of species.  Other topics include the bubonic plagues, epidemics, discussions about tsunamis (including some good stuff on wave motion and tides), earthquakes, different scales for measuring the energy released in earthquakes, volcanoes, and asteroid impacts.  In all these cases the author makes a point of illustrating the effect of these catastrophes by recounting historical examples.  But what I liked best was the way he delves into the science behind each type of natural catastrophe.<br />The last chapter on natural disasters deals with hurricanes and tornadoes.  This leads naturally to the book's closing topics of irreproducible phenomena and chaos.  There are better books on chaos, but this was not Zebrowski's primary topic.  His chapter makes a nice introduction to the subject.  The point of his closing remarks is that the science of natural disasters is intermingled with the unpredictability of chaos, and that some fundamentally new science is needed to make additional significant progress in dealing with predictions of things like earthquakes and hurricanes.  Some of the material in this last chapter might be a bit difficult to understand if you haven't had some prior exposure to the subject (it tends to be a little abbreviated).  <br />Overall, this is a wonderful book.  It's informative, well written, nicely illustrated, heavily referenced, has a complete index, and (most importantly) the practical information within it might even save your life.  It's well worth reading, in my opinion, if you like science and are a little bit curious about our restless planet.	2001-08-31
US	53038410	R31S3X58M9VZMH	0618056734	750191808	Unweaving the Rainbow: Science, Delusion and the Appetite for Wonder	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Truth is stranger (and more beautiful) than fiction	For thousands of years, rainbows were beautiful, mysterious things, often associated with the supernatural, and universally looked upon with awe.  Then along came Newton, who, with a small chunk of glass, discovered that it's possible to make an artificial rainbow.  His experiments showed that what we call white light is really a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow, and that raindrops, suspended in the air, act like tiny prisms.  It isn't magic.  It isn't supernatural.  <br />Poets have repined over Newton's discovery, feeling that something was lost by his unweaving the rainbow and giving a scientific explanation for something that was, for so long, a thing of mystical beauty.  Dawkins, though, takes issue with this point of view.  His thesis is that understanding the universe does not destroy its beauty and wonder, nor should it dampen our artistic appreciation.   <br />One of the arguments he makes is that science has been too timid in just accepting, without argument, the poet's complaint.  To make his point, Dawkins shows how almost unimaginable knowledge has come to us as a result of understanding light - which began with Newton unweaving the rainbow - and how the universe is infinitely more incredible now, than it was when we saw stars as simple points of light in the night sky.  In the process, Dawkins provides some interesting insights into a wide array of physical phenomena.  He describes how we see color, in the first place.  This is fascinating reading.  Then he explains how the ultimate unweaving of light - understanding it at the roots of its quantum nature - has led to understanding the chemical makeup of stars that are billions of light years away.  Furthermore, the nature of this ancient light tells us how space is changing - expanding - and how this knowledge helps us understand the origins of the universe itself, and ultimately it's future fate.  So, when Newton told us how rainbows work, he did not make them any less beautiful.  Instead, heopened up broad vistas of insight that led to unimaginable new knowledge about a universe that is vastly more complicated, rich, and wonderful than the simplistic views it displaced.  <br />While encouraging appreciation for the truly wonderful and amazing things in nature, Dawkins is quick to point out that \\"we have an appetite for wonder, a poetic appetite, which real science ought to be feeding but which is being hijacked, often for monetary gain, by purveyors of superstition, the paranormal and astrology.\\"  He devotes a fair amount of this book to discussions about these superstitions, how they are inconsistent with logic and scientific facts, and how they actually demean the truly amazing universe in which we live.<br />One of the most interesting chapters describes how animals are actually predisposed by evolutionary pressure to make false statistical associations.  Dawkins describes experiments that show this effect in birds.  The basic approach of these experiments is to teach the animal some behavior (pecking at a special spot in the cage, for example) by rewarding it regularly with food.  Then, the experiments went on to show that if the food is rewarded on a random basis, the birds accidentally pick up and focus on some random behavior that they incorrectly associate with getting food.  In a word, they learn to be superstitious.  In one particular example, Dawkins explains how a researcher \\"set up the apparatus to `reward' the pigeon from time to time no matter what the bird did.  Now all that the bird actually needed to do was sit back and wait for the reward.  But in fact, this is not what they did.  Instead, in six out of eight cases, they built up - exactly as though they were learning a reward habit - what Skinner called `superstitious' behavior. ... One bird spun itself round like a top two or three turns anticlockwise between `rewards.'  Another bird repeatedly thrust its head towards one particular upper corner of the box.  A third bird showed \\"tossing\\" behavior, as if lifting an invisible curtain with its head.\\"  [see pages 163-164].  The point of all this is that animals (and not just birds) have a tendency to make false associations of causality, and this is largely our basis for belief in many things, including the supernatural.   It's something to think about next time you find yourself hesitating about stepping on a crack, walking under a ladder, accepting a room on the 13'th floor, or watching someone getting \\"healed\\" by the laying on of hands.<br />Dawkins argues that scientists should learn to be a little more poetic, but that trying to teach science with poetry can cause problems.  In particular, he takes Stephen Jay Gould to task for using what he calls \\"bad poetry\\" in which the scientific meaning gets lost, or seriously distorted.  Personally, I enjoy poetry, but think it has no place in scientific explanations - and I agree that when it gets carried away, the ambiguous and metaphorical nature of poetry can cause some real hang ups when trying to understand scientific principles.  It's been a complaint of mine, before, that I don't think scientist should describe fundamental particles as \\"dancing,\\" \\"kissing,\\" etc., though some do.<br />Dawkins also includes some interesting stuff on the genetic view of survival in which the \\"environment\\" is the sea of other genes - both cooperative types and enemies - that from it's immediate environment.  This part of the book provides some really interesting insights and an interesting point of view for evolution.<br />The book has a good index, and is very well written.  Dawkins is an excellent writer, but just the same, I think a few illustrations would have added to this book (there are none).  Still, this is an excellent book. I highly recommend it for anyone with a general interest in science	2001-08-20
US	53038410	R3RJ7E29W32UWV	0738203491	205572118	The Pleasure of Finding Things Out: The Best Short Works of Richard P. Feynman	Books	5	26	26	N	N	A scientist's scientist	Feynman seems to have something of a cult following, which is a shame, I think.  He'd not approve of it.  Reading his books, though, it's easy to understand how many people might come to almost worship the man.  He was not only a remarkable scientist, he was accessible to the layman by virtue of his clear communication and clear language style.  It was his accessibility, his style of communicating in the popular vernacular, and his passion for understanding and explaining things at their most basic level that gained him so much respect.  While many academics were busy trying to impress their peers with 50-dollar words and technical mumbo jumbo, Feynman was explaining things with words like &quot;jiggle.&quot;  <br />While appreciating Feynman's dislike of cult figures, I count myself among the thousands of individuals that admire the man not only for his intelligence, but also for his earthly mannerisms.  Here was a man who was not only very smart  he was, in a real sense, one of us; part of the mass of humanity.  I found this book to be very engaging.  In typical Feynman style it is both easy to read, and profoundly enlightening.  These are the musings of a citizen scientist, curious intellectual, and genuine genius.  <br />One of the stories I enjoyed most was Feynman's description of things his father taught him about birds.  One day one of the other school kids asked Feynman to name a particular bird in the field.  Feynman replied that he had no idea what the bird's name was, whereupon the kid jested that Feynman's dad had taught him nothing.  But it was just the opposite.  Feynman's dad had taught him lots about the bird  things about its behavior, color, etc.  As Feynman recalls his father's lesson: &quot;you know in all the languages you want to know what the name of that bird is and when you've finished with all that you'll know absolutely nothing whatsoever about the bird.  You only know about humans in different places and what they call the bird.&quot; [See page 4].  This is a most profound observation that many people seem continually confused about: memorizing language-based facts (like the names of birds, lizards, planets, etc.) is not the same as studying those things, and understanding them.<br />Another of Feynman's beliefs was that understanding things at a mathematical and scientific level does not, and should not, destroy one's ability to appreciate the wonder of the world and universe we live in.  In fact, Feynman argues just the opposite; that someone who understands science should find the world an even richer and more amazing place than someone who looks at it with unknowing eyes.  This is also a theme in Richard Dawkins' book &quot;Unweaving the Rainbow.&quot;<br />The book is replete with Feynman's musings about the nature of science, and a common thread is that the core of science is the freedom to doubt.  He muses that he &quot;believe[s] that one of the greatest dangers to modern society is the possible resurgence and expansion of the ideas of thought control; such as Hitler had, or Stalin in his time, or the Catholic religion in the Middle Ages, or the Chinese today.&quot; [See page 99].  He also speaks of the absolute need for full intellectual honesty in science: report all the data, and don't allow personal prejudices to filter it.  Lay it all out, keep total commitment to truth, and let the chips fall where they fall.<br />One chapter describes his ideas regarding the conflict between science and religion.  While other authors seem inclined to simply repeat the mantra &quot;there is no fundamental problem between science and religion&quot; Feynman points out that doubt is a foundation stone for science and a frequent taboo in religion.  He also (correctly) points out that religion is composed of multiple parts, and that there is not a disagreement between the ethical parts of religion and science, but that a schism does exist between science and much of the mythological base found in religion.  <br />It's not all about philosophy (which Feynman generally disliked).  There are chapters that describe the ultimate energy use of computing machines, appeals for the development of nano technology, and Feynman's report on the Challenger disaster.  There are also fun chapters, with Feynman describing some of his experiences while working at Los Alamos during development of the atomic bomb.  Found throughout these stories are his contempt for figures of authority, and his ever-present need to question things, especially those things we take for granted.<br />In keeping with Feynman's advice, I resolved to find at least one thing in his book with which I disagreed.  After all, Feynman would have wanted it that way.    In the chapter that discusses science and religion, Feynman states &quot; it seems to me that there is no scientific evidence bearing on the Golden Rule.&quot;  On the contrary, I think evolutionary pressure actually selects for &quot;the Golden Rule,&quot; and I believe authors like Dawkins have shown convincingly that what looks like selflessness in some types of altruistic behavior is actually, from an evolutionary point of view, a selfish thing (it promotes the replication of genes responsible for that behavior).<br />Whether or not you agree with everything in the book is hardly the point.  Feynman's point is that we should question and think about everything  including what he wrote.  That's how you find things out.  And if you've ever had the pleasure of finding things out, and then sitting back with hands clasped behind your head and a broad smile across your face, this book is for you.	2001-07-30

Wise' thesis is that these murders were orchestrated and directed by Brigham Young, who was the prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS, or Mormon) as well as the territorial governor at the time.  <br />Growing up in the LDS Church, I'd been taught that the Massacre was the dirty work of local Indians, that the LDS Church had nothing to do with it, and that accusations of complicity by Brigham Young were nothing but filthy lies by the Church's enemies. [See, for example, Essentials in Church History, Joseph Fielding Smith, 1950, pages 418-422].  Basically, the LDS response has been: \\"We didn't do it.  The Indians did it.  But if we had done it, we'd have had a really good reason because those gentiles were so evil.\\"  <br />Wise, though, has the upper hand in this debate.  He has clearly demonstrated his thesis with far more references to verifiable history than anything I've ever seen offered by the Church.  Wise begins by dispelling LDS propaganda to the effect that the train consisted of \\"Missouri Wild Cats,\\" who intimidated the Mormons until they felt moved to murder.  Appendix A lists the people in the Fancher train, which consisted mostly of prosperous families from Arkansas, including many women and children.  Latter chapters also provide convincing evidence that the Fancher train was denied the opportunity to purchase supplies in Utah because of anti-Gentile sentiment that had been fanned by Brigham Young in advance of a US Army sent to re-establish law and order in the Utah territory.  He also shows (through eye-witness historical accounts) that the Fancher train had originally planned to take the northern route, but were persuaded by Mormon leaders to take the Southern route, ostensibly to facilitate the ambush and murder by LDS members in Southern Utah.<br />To understand the massacreat Mountain Meadows you must first understand the origin of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the violence that engulfed it's early years.  This background information consumes over 1/3 of Wise' book.  The author begins by describing Joseph Smith as a gold digger that hired out with local farmers to help them find buried treasure by looking at special \\"seer\\" stones.  Joseph's boyhood was one of abject poverty, and get-rich schemes were an important part of his early life.  Eventually this led him to create the Book of Mormon (see \\"Quest for the Gold Plates,\\" by Stan Larson) and organize the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. <br />The early history of the Church was fraught with violence by both Gentiles and Mormons.  On the whole, I think Wise does a balanced job of describing how and why the violence existed, and why it involved Mormons more than most other new religions of the time.  These reasons include exclusionary LDS theology, the practice of polygamy and polyandry by Church leaders, sermons that \\"consecrated\\" to the Saints the land and other wealth of their Gentile \\"enemies,\\" and the habit of stripping apostates of their property, and subjecting them to physical abuse and sometimes murder.  Eventually Mormon apostates had enough of it and setup a printing press to describe what was going on within the Church.  Smith had the press destroyed, and the resulting train of events led to his arrest, and eventual murder while in prison.  <br />With Smith's death, Brigham Young took control of the Church and led the Saints to Utah, where he held it in firm control as both Prophet and territorial governor.  Wise describes a Utah under the theocratic rule of a ruthless man who didn't hesitate to have the Danites, Young's band of assassins, murder anyone who got in the way.  Wise includes many historical (though anecdotal) accounts of such murders, as well as the no-longer-practiced doctrine of \\"Blood Atonement,\\" whereby apostates and certain other sinners were required to have their throats slit to atone for their sins.  He also explains how early versions of the LDS temple endowment included an oath to avenge Smith's murder.  This is important in understanding the motive behind the massacre at mountain meadows.<br />It was under these conditions that the Fancher train wandered into Utah.  Wise describes the process of the massacre in detail.  One of the surprises for me was how the massacre happened over an extended period of several days.  The initial ambush, led by John D. Lee (Brigham Young's adopted son) and several other Mormons dressed as Indians, killed six or seven men of the Fancher party.  The emigrants immediately brought their wagons into a circle, and setup fortifications.  The resulting stalemate lasted for several days until the emigrants, driven by thirst, sent two men to Cedar City (a Mormon establishment) to ask for help. Instead of help, though, William Stewart, a local Mormon High Priest, shot and killed one of them.  The emigrants also sent two of their party west for help, but these were hunted down and murdered by a group lead by LDS missionary Ira Hatch.  Eventually the Mormons promised the emigrants a truce, but while the defenseless rag-tag group was being led from their fortification, the Mormons and Indians fell upon them, murdering everyone in the party except about 18 children.<br />This isn't the end of the story, though.  Wise goes on to explain the resulting investigation, as well as the obstruction of justice and destruction of evidence employed by Brigham Young to help him and his conspirators evade the law.  Wise is to be commended for his telling of this barbaric act.  If you have any interest in LDS history, or history of the Wild West, I think this book belongs on your shelf.	2001-07-19

It's the sort of book you can read on the airplane - not too mentally exhausting, but not the sort of reading that leaves you feeling guilty about wasting your time, like you might after watching the movie.<br />Fraser's book is primarily a history of the science of antimatter, from its prediction by Dirac to the discovery of the positron by Carl Anderson and the fabrication of the first atoms of chemical antimatter by Walter Oelert's team at CERN.   The book is also useful for understanding some essential and basic notions about antimatter - especially in the context in which these notions led to important experiments and theories regarding the stuff.  <br />Fraser describes Dirac's development of four-by-four matrices to represent the electron, and the implication of particles with negative energy, from symmetry in these equations.  This led to Dirac's view of the vacuum, which \\"could no longer be thought of as a void where nothing happened.  In the new Dirac picture, the vacuum was in fact a bottomless pit of negative energy particles, each carrying negative charge.\\" [page 61].   Initially resistant to the idea of a new particle, Dirac finally accepted the implications of his equations and wrote: \\"A hole, if there were one, would be a new kind of particle, unknown to experimental physics, having the same mass and opposite charge to an electron.  We may call such a particle an anti-electron.\\" [page 62].<br />One of the nice things about this book is the way it shows how science works - often in fits and starts, with plenty of blind alleys.  Fraser also leaves the reader with a better appreciation for the difficulty of certain experimental observations.  He gives, for example, a good description of what the tracks of elementary particles look like in a cloud chamber, and the difficulty of unambiguously identifying particles that streak through them.  For example, a positron traveling upward through the cloud chamber can look just like an electron traveling downward through the chamber.  How do you tell which is which?  This was just one of the issues that Carl Anderson had to sort out before confirming the first identified observation of the positron.  <br />Throughout the book Fraser reflects back on a principal theme - one of symmetry.  A deep belief in symmetry has played an important role in the development of many theories in physics, and is deeply involved in our understanding of anti-matter.  Richard Feynman brought a deeper understanding of antimatter through the realization that particles of anti-matter can be thought of as their normal-matter counter parts traveling backward in time (this is a key element of many \\"Feynman\\" diagrams).<br />I have noticed a trend among popular science authors to use poetic language, sometimes to the point of obstructing the meaning of the science.  Fraser uses his share of such language, with subatomic particles in \\"electrical wedlock,\\" \\"kissing,\\" \\"dancing,\\" etc.  Sometimes it's just a little too much.  My only other complaint is that the index is too brief.  It has, for example, entries in the index for the Dirac equation and Dirac matrices, but nothing for the man, Dirac, for whom there is far more text than for either of the other two.  Other than that, this is a pretty good book, overall.  I'd wanted something that dealt more with the actual physics of antimatter, rather than a book that deals mostly with the scientific history of the stuff, but that's my personal preference.  The history is interesting, too.  If you have even a passing interest in antimatter, I think this book belongs on your shelf.	2001-07-19

When TWA flight 800 exploded shortly after takeoff on July 17, 1996, the immediate speculation centered around a terrorist attack.  This premature conclusion was based on some eyewitness accounts and political circumstances that fomented such speculation.  Christine, though, shows how careful examination of the wreckage has shown, almost conclusively, that the airliner was brought down not by a terrorist bomb or missile, but by an explosion in the nearly empty center wing tank.<br />Christine writes her book in the style of an investigative reporter, with windows into the lives of many of the people connected with this tragedy.  You come to know many of the victims, the crew, and investigators as she threads her way through the tangled story.  <br />Having a somewhat technical background, I found myself frequently wishing the author had included more engineering detail in her narrative.  I think the average reader, however, will find the level about right - especially those who tend to focus more on the human element than the engineering issues.  <br />Christine's main thesis is that an explosion in the nearly empty center fuel tank brought down the jetliner, that Boeing and the FAA had reason to know a design defect could cause such an explosion, that they chose economy over saving people's lives, and that it's bound to happen again.  <br />The first of these claims has been born out and accepted by the scientific investigation of the crash.  Having exhausted all the other possibilities (including missiles and bombs) the investigators have concluded with high probability that the explosion resulted from faulty wiring and a volatile mixture of fumes and air in the center wing tank.  The second claim also seems to be established.  Flight 800 was not the first explosion of a fuel tank, and the volatile properties of the gaseous mix in a hot, nearly empty fuel tank were known.  In fact, Boeing took extraordinary precautions to prevent an ignition source within the tankprecisely to avoid such an explosion.  I think it's also fair to say that the design decisions were largely based on economics, and not strictly on making the planes as safe as possible for the flying public.  Christine illustrates how fuel inerting systems exist, and how they are used on military aircraft to prevent fires.  I'm not sure Christine fully establishes her fourth claim - that it could happen again.  Of course, nothing is perfectly safe, so there is always a finite probability that another explosion will occur.  But it's not clear that preventing ignition sources by design and proper maintenance (there is strong evidence that old wiring was the ignition source on flight 800) is inherently less sure than inerting systems.<br />I think Christine should also have spent more time developing her argument about designing for safety instead of economy.  She seems indignant at the prospects of economic equations that allow for a certain percentage of fatalities before spending money on a cure.  Yet we all make these decisions each day.  Pedestrians in New York City, for example, hardly ever wear bicycle helmets, even though a certain percentage of pedestrian deaths would be eliminated if everyone wore head protection.  Somewhere, in the back of our minds, each of us decides that somehow the risk of death is insufficient to encumber us with the cost and inconvenience of wrapping our head in plastic-shrouded Styrofoam.  Similarly the existence of cost-benefit economic equations that allow for a certain possibility of mid-air explosions is not, in and of itself, immoral.  The real issues are quantitative: What are the probabilities?  What value do they assign to human life?  What are the costs?  <br />Unfortunately, Christine does not deal with the question quantitatively, which is my only real complaint about this book.  As I said, however, I don't think Christine intended to write to an audience of aeronautical engineers.  As popular science I think she's written a fine book.  I certainly found it entertaining.  I read the entire thing on a flight from Portland to Boston (well, I had about 50 pages to finish when I got to my hotel).  It's one of those books that grips you.  One you can hardly put down.  And, yes, every once in a while, as I read the book at 37,000 feet, I found myself wishing that Boeing had used fuel inerting.	2001-07-19
US	53038410	R1A8H3PLUJ2UTK	0738201243	526655195	The Search for Life on Mars (Helix Books)	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Not as easy as you might think	This book is a little like \\"Here be Dragons,\\" (Koerner, LeVay, Oxford University Press, 2000) and \\"Rare Earth,\\" (Ward, Brownlee, Copernicus, 2000) except that it is more focused and specific than the others.    While Koerner, LeVay, Ward, and Brownlee consider the possibility that life exists outside the solar system, Walter limits the scope of his book to the question of whether microbes exist, or once existed, on Mars.  <br />Life outside of earth has never been unambiguously observed and verified.  Consequently, discussions about the possibility of life beyond earth inevitably begin with thoughts about how life originated here.  There seems to be an emerging sense that life is the result of a universe that is naturally self-organizing (Stuart Kauffman is in this camp.  See his book \\"At Home in the Universe, Oxford University Press, 1995).  According to this point of view, life is all but certain to arise on any planet having the basic chemicals and physical conditions found on earth 4 billion years ago.   Given this hypothesis - that life arises quickly and naturally in the proper environment - it's natural to ask if any other planets in the solar system have (or had) the necessary ingredients.  If they did, we should look to see if life evolved there.  Since there is growing evidence that Mars had a distant past with some of these conditions, it seems more and more important that we look for life on Mars.  Finding evidence of life there would buttress the concept that life readily evolves given the proper environment.  Obviously, if that's the case, it holds enormous consequences for modern science.<br />Walter has a nice chapter on the tree of life, and describes recent information showing that \\"all the lowest branches of the tree are occupied by hyperthermophiles.\\"  The discovery that life exists on earth under extreme conditions (like those of deep-sea thermal vents) has increased the hope among scientists that it might also have evolved and flourished on Mars many thousands of millions of years ago.  He also shows how genetic transfer between species happens today, and was probably common among our earliest ancestors, so that the whole concept of a \\"tree of life\\" becomes somewhat tangled during the earliest stages of the evolution of life.  Instead of a tree, the topology looks more like a web, with the roots of the tree (consisting of Bacteria, Eucarya, and Archaea) rising out of this web.  <br />The expectation of finding evidence of life on Mars depends on the type of environment that Mars supported in the distant past, and the circumstances under which life arose on earth.  It also depends on how easy it is to ascertain the evidence of fossilized ancient microbial life.  It turns out that identifying evidence of microbes in very old rocks is a pretty hard thing to do.  To illustrate this, Walter describes the difficulty of identifying stromatolites in ancient rocks.  This was new information for me, and a real insight into the nuts and bolts of making these sorts of identifications.  I'd thought that stromatolites were easy to identify, but in the very oldest rocks, they're not.   When identifying stromatolites in rocks 3000 million years old, there can be (and often is) a great deal of controversy regarding the conclusion.  Walter's point in making this so clear is that stromatolites are large colonies of microbes, yet even they are not unambiguously identified in the oldest rocks.  The problem of identifying evidence for individual microbes in rocks 3000 to 3500 million years old is even tougher.  The point being that even with Martian rocks in our hands, it's not going to be easy to affirmatively state whether there is evidence of ancient life on Mars.<br />To drill the point home, Walter points to the fact that we do have chunks of Martian rocks on hand, in the form of bits and pieces that have been blasted off the Martian surface by meteorite impacts.  Walter describes in detail the scientific examination of some of these rocks, and one, in particular, identified as ALH84001.  This meteorite made world news when a team of scientists reported finding evidence of ancient microbes buried inside it.  Walter describes the initial reports, the objections, and the eventual state of limbo in which these conclusions came to rest.  This helps set the tone for expectations regarding the difficulty against which such analysis will proceed even when we manage to return samples from the Martian surface using spacecraft.<br />In describing how scientists make conclusion about the presence of microbes in ancient rocks, Walter does a real service by illustrating the importance of convergent evidence.  Identifying ancient microbes involves more than one type of observation.  It involves many types of converging data, including visible observations of deposits in rocks, the types of rocks involved, and things like carbon isotope ratios (not to be confused with carbon 14, which decays far to quickly for analysis in 3000-million-year-old rocks).  Along these lines, I noticed a recent article in Photonics Spectra (May 2001) describing the use of Raman imaging to identify microfossils - another tool, in the search for the ancient life on earth, and possibly on Mars. <br />The book ends with some very informative discussions about proposals for future landing sites on Mars, for sample analysis and/or return.<br />This is a very informative book, with useful insights into the way science works, complete with several pages of color plates, a useable index, and short list of further reading material.  If you are interested in what NASA does, and how the scientific search for life on Mars is (and will be) carried out, I think you will like it.  I certainly did.	2001-05-25
US	53038410	R2G1NAIHW8NKEA	0300076363	315059543	Wild Solutions: How Biodiversity is Money in the Bank	Books	5	7	8	N	N	Fascinating reading	Beattie and Ehrlich propose that nature represents an enormous reservoir of capital in the form of chemicals and genes that, having evolved over millions of years, can serve people by providing solutions to such things as diseases, better crops, mining, and energy.  In support of their thesis, they've written this book, which is filled with dozens of examples of natural solutions for such things as human illnesses and pest control.  A secondary and supporting thesis is that natural ecosystems are complex, with hundreds of interdependencies that link sub-populations in the ecosystem in unpredictable ways.    As a result, it's often difficult, if not impossible, to predict how a seemingly minor alteration of an ecosystem will ripple through at different levels. <br />It seems that one of their goals is to encourage the listing of natural ecosystems as valuable assets.  Too often, they argue, the true value of natural ecosystems is lost in economic policy, with the serious loss of important natural solutions that might otherwise have greatly benefited humankind.  While I agree that natural ecosystems should be appreciated for their capitalistic value, I think the book's arguments are only moderately persuasive in that regard, and unlikely to convince many capitalists to deal more gently, or responsibly, with earth's natural resources.  I also think their argument places the environmental movement on a slippery slope.  By asserting that natural ecosystems should be protected for their capitalistic value, they open the door to counter arguments that natural systems with limited, or no, capitalistic value need not be protected.  I'm personally more persuaded by holistic and ethical arguments, like those of Native American culture, which views humanity as an integral part of nature; a part that cannot remain morally and ethically whole without showing respect and care for Mother Earth.   <br />However, I'm not so idealistic as to think the Alaska wildlife refuge will be saved by appeals to ethics, beauty, solitude, and spiritual oneness with nature.  So, in retrospect, I suppose if Beattie and Ehrlich can convince even a few Texas oil men in the new administration to go easy on the environment \\"for the money\\" it will have been worth it.<br />I didn't buy this book because of its main thesis.  I bought it because it is chock full of interesting tidbits and information about how animals interact with each other and their environment.  The book is easy to read, captivating, and well written.  The illustrations, by Christine Turnbull, are abundant and add considerably to the book.  Each is artfully composed in simple black and white with detail and clarity that brings additional insight to the text (there are 40 all together).  <br />In one sense this book might have been called \\"The Second Earth.\\"  There isn't a whole lot about the big animals that people think of. There are no accounts of tigers or bears.  Discussions about animals larger than a cat are few.  Mostly its about bacteria, beetles, ants, worms, grubs, and things like that.  The stories tell how these animals have evolved the most interesting interrelationships, and how the crucible of evolution has resulted in some truly amazing chemical and genetic solutions that animals use - and that we can adapt and use, as well.  <br />Many of the accounts describe how natural solutions can be used to solve problems with crop infestation.  Often, the stories illustrate how these natural solutions not only work better, but are also less expensive and less damaging to the environment.  One example is found in the story of Opuntia, an ornamental cactus plant that escaped from Australian settlers and infested the countryside.  According to the authors, the cost of clearing the land mechanically, or poisoning the plants, was greater than the value of the land itself.  Furthermore, the cactus grew so densely that it crowded out indigenous plants.  To solve the problem, Australian biologistswent to South America to search for natural enemies of Opuntia.  The solution turned out to be a cactus-eating moth called Cactoblastis, which quickly cleared most of the Opuntia from the countryside. <br />Another interesting story tells how Australian aborigines would take a cloth and hold it over a nest of bull ants.  The ants would swarm over the cloth, whereupon they were shaken from it, and the cloth was then use to bind wounds.  These aboriginal people had discovered that wounds bound in such cloth heal without infection.  The reason?  Bull ants, being social animals, suffer from diseases (much like our social species).  To combat the microbe hordes, bull ants have evolved antibiotics that coat their bodies.  Their swarming bodies transfer some of this antibiotic to the cloth, which then serves to protect the wound.  <br />Overall, this is a great book, but I wish the authors had included references for some of the things they discuss.  Several times I found myself beating back feelings of genuine aggravation when the authors would make claims, with no way to verify or expand on them through chapter endnotes.  They do, however, have a generic list of recommended reading material and a useful index at the end of the book.<br />If you find nature fascinating, and love to read a well-written book on the subject, then I heartily recommend this one.  It will make you think, and more than once, while reading it, I'm sure you will say, \\"Gee, I never knew that!  How interesting.\\"	2001-05-24
US	53038410	R1QXV7ETBC333S	0195128524	997233304	Here Be Dragons: The Scientific Quest for Extraterrestrial Life	Books	4	22	23	N	N	Personally, I think Fermi got it right.	This book's been on my shopping list for a while, so I was delighted to find it while strolling through a small bookstore in downtown Astoria.  I put it in my shopping bag, along with \\"The Search for Life on Mars,\\" (Malcolm Walker, Perseus Books, 1999).  This is the sort of book that almost anyone with an interest in science and/or astronomy will enjoy.  It's easy reading, and doesn't really require any prerequisite knowledge.<br />The book isn't about dragons.  It's about the scientific search for extraterrestrial life.  The title's taken from a phrase used by old cartographers to indicate unexplored regions of the earth.  The play on words, obviously, is that the search for extraterrestrial life takes us into uncharted territory.   <br />\\"Here be dragons\\" is a little like \\"Rare earth,\\" (Ward, Brownlee, Copernicus press, 2000) with a different slant, and a different opinion held by the authors.  While Ward and Brownlee are of the opinion that intelligent life is extremely rare in the universe, Koerner and LeVay tend toward the opinion that \\"...the resulting pressures [of evolution] may commonly foster a trend toward complexification and the ability to react and learn.\\"  In line with the hopes of SETI, Koerner and LeVay are of the opinion that \\"intelligence and technology is common in the galaxy.\\"  They find the Fermi Paradox (if intelligence were common in the galaxy, where are the extraterrestrials) \\"poorly conceived,\\" though they admit their views may be grounded in faith as much as in reason.<br />The book's flow is both logical and predictable.  It begins by describing the theories of the origin of life on earth, including hyperthermophiles and life at the extreme, near mid-ocean vents and hot springs.  There's a brief review of Stanley Miller's experiment in the 50's, and how he synthesized many important organic compounds by simulating what he thought, at the time, was a realistic approximation of earth's early atmosphere.  But our understanding of the earlyatmosphere has changed since then, and it looks like the experiment Miller performed doesn't match atmospheric conditions, as we understand them today.  This has led scientists to look at other possibilities for the origin of life.  For example, organic compounds have been found in space, so there is some speculation that the initial ingredients for life might have been extraterrestrial.  Also, recent evidence suggests that our earliest common ancestors were hyperthermophiles, so deep-sea vents may be where life first arose.      <br />Recent discoveries of the extreme conditions in which life exists on earth has led to new speculation about its possible existence on other planets.  Mars, for example, might harbor life today, deep under ground (as it is found on earth).  During a warmer and wetter past, Mars might even have supported life on its surface. <br />Throughout the book, the authors act as scientific investigative reporters.  They use the book to teach, but also to give a representative view of what different scientists and researchers in various fields are doing.  Ordinarily, I'd prefer to see authors be a little more forceful in presenting an idea or opinion, and then working to defend it.  But the situation with Koerner and LeVay is different.  Exobiology, unlike other branches of science, is one in which the principal subject of research has not been shown to exist.  The field is so new that speculation and widely divergent opinions abound.  In view of this state of flux, I think it's particularly valuable for their book to sample the broader spectrum of ideas.<br />After describing the conditions under which life arose on earth, and how it might exist on other planets, the authors proceed to describe the direction of evolution.  The point of this discussion is whether evolution has any tendency toward greater levels of complexity, and specifically whether it drives toward the evolution of beings intelligent enough to build a radio transmitter.  They sample the opinions of three scientists: Simon Conway Morris, Stephen Jay Gould, and Stuart Kauffman.  While these scientists share common ground, they also draw different conclusions and place emphasis in different ways.  Personally, I think Stephen Jay Gould comes closest to the truth.  It seems obvious to me that the chances of finding intelligence on other planets (where \\"intelligence\\" means being able to design and build a system that can communicate with earth) is about as likely as finding a woodpecker (an example used in the book) or an elephant.  Humans - in spite of the inflated opinion we have of ourselves - are not the end product of evolution.  Our species represents a single point in a morphological phase space of nearly infinite expanse.  While I suspect there are strange attractors in this space, it seems less than obvious to me that intelligence (of the sort possessed by humans) is so close to one of these strange attractors as to ensure its evolution during the lifetime of a given planet.  <br />The authors have a pretty interesting chapter on SETI, as well as one about science and the religion of UFOs.  They end the book with some exotic extrapolations and speculation of life on other planets, complete with philosophical discussions about cosmology, the anthropic principle, many worlds, multiple universes, and a whole bunch of other subjects that are as easily tossed about by novices and experts, alike.<br />The book is sparsely illustrated, with an ample index and extensive list of additional reading material.  It's well written, easy to read, and entertaining.  It's pure speculation (of course) about what we shall find of extraterrestrial life.  The real scientific value is in its descriptions of the origin of life on earth, aspects of evolution, and the way it sets the mind to wondering.	2001-05-24
US	53038410	R1OEVKM6PKP86N	0393969975	846848903	DIV, Grad, Curl, and All That: An Informal Text on Vector Calculus	Books	5	116	118	N	N	A great introduction to vector calculus	It's been over two decades since I first studied vector calculus from my old textbook on electromagnetic fields and waves (Lorrain and Corson, Freeman, 1970).   I really enjoyed that class, and remain fascinated by the beautiful mathematics involved in the classical field equations of electromagnetism.  When I saw Schey's book on the shelf in Boulder, Co., I immediately picked it up and flipped through the pages.  This wasn't the book I'd set out to find (I wanted a good book on Photonics, to commemorate the conference I was attending at NIST on fiber-optic measurements) but I decided it would be fun to read it as a refresher course.<br />My first impression of Schey's book is that it would make a great first course in vector calculus.  In fact, I recommend it for that purpose.  It will also be very useful for the student enrolled in a class on vector calculus, who wants a secondary reference text to help expand concepts.  Schey's approach will appeal to physicists and engineers, with it's intuitive, visual style.  Schey uses electric fields as the motivating challenge for developing equations that use the divergence, gradient, and curl, and he uses chapter 1 to develop virtually all the physical concepts needed to follow the derivations.  For prerequisites, you should have at least one semester of calculus, and it will help to have a little understanding about electromagnetism, as well (a high school level will be more than adequate for this purpose).  <br />Schey's book also makes a great refresher text (that's why I bought it).  If you've had vector calculus in college, you'll be able to read this book in a week or so.  It's nicely illustrated, and has problems at the end of each chapter that are strategically designed to extend concepts brought out in the text (solutions to most of the problems appear at the end of the text).   <br />The book's organization is pretty simple, with four sections/chapters.  The first is a basic introduction that describes the notion of a vector field and some basic concepts in electrostatics.  True to the overall theme throughout the text, Schey uses simple, intuitive explanations and drawings that are especially applicable for beginning students.  <br />The second section introduces surface integrals and divergence.  As he does in the remaining chapters, Schey develops equations in Cartesian, spherical, and cylindrical coordinate systems (though he sometimes leaves some of these as exercises for the student).  He also summarizes them at the end of the book.  In addition to giving the functional, coordinate-dependent form, Schey also shows how the operators are limits that exist as physical entities, independent of any particular coordinate system.  For example, Schey summarizes divergence as the limit, as the volume goes to zero, of the flux of the vector field through a surface, divided by the volume enclosed by the surface (see page 37).  Beginning texts don't always make this clear, resulting in some students failing to understand divergence (for example) as anything more than the equation that describes it in Cartesian coordinates.  But Schey artfully incorporates this more general understanding as part of his clear and intuitive style of teaching.<br />The third section is about line integrals, the Curl, and Stokes' theorem.  The approach is intuitive, with a minimum of formal mathematics, and abundant, clear, diagrams that greatly help to illustrate principles.  As with divergence, Schey provides the mathematical form for Curl in three different coordinate systems, as well as the general description (independent of coordinate system): curl is the limit of circulation to area, in the limit, as the area tends to zero.<br />The fourth, and final section deals with the Gradient.  In keeping with the general theme of deriving the mathematical tools to calculate the electric field, Schey summarizes the relationship between the Curl of the vector field, the vector field as the gradient of a scalar function, and the line integral around a closed path of the dot product between the tangent and the vector field.  He also extends the notion of the gradient operator to that of the Laplacian, and discusses Poisson's and Laplace's equations. As with the other chapters, Schey makes a point of endowing his explanations with intuitive and visual explanations, explaining that \\"the gradient of a scalar function F(x,y,z) is a vector that is in the direction in which [the scalar function] F undergoes the greatest rate of increase and that has magnitude equal to the rate of increase in that direction.&quot;<br />I really enjoyed reading this book.

I think it will be interesting reading for just about everyone, from the high school student with a penchant for mathematics to armchair intellectuals, statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists.<br />Bruce's approach is to teach concepts in statistics and probability through mystery stories written around the characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  At first I was a bit skeptical, wondering if something this non-traditional might be just a gimmick.  I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the book not only has real intellectual merit, but that Bruce is a pretty good mystery writer to boot.<br />Holmes solves most of the mysteries in this book by using analysis grounded in the mathematics of statistics.  Some of the solutions to these mysteries are non-intuitive, and may trip up even those who consider themselves to be experts.  Gambling fallacies are a common theme, including the mistaken idea that the \\"law of averages\\" somehow decrees that, after a string of one type of random event, another type of independent random event becomes more probable.  This error is rooted in the mistaken notion that if the ratio of two numbers approaches 1, then the difference between the two numbers approaches 0.  For example, if you toss a fair coin N times, the ratio of the total number of heads, divided by the total number of tails, approaches 1 as N becomes very large.  However, the difference between the number of heads and the number of tails can (and usually does) diverge.  There is nothing in the laws of statistics that says that, after a string of 10 heads, the next throw of the coin is more likely to come up tails (if the coin is fair).  Yet this common fallacy persists among many gamblers.  This is closely related to the mathematics of the drunkard's walk, which is the centerpiece of another mystery unraveled by Holmes as he investigates the case of an unfortunate sailor and the insurance money pursued by his distraught sister.<br />In another caper, Holmes uses his knowledge of the well-known birthday paradox (given N people in a room, what is the probability that two or more of them will share a common birthday) to expose a fake genealogy at the heart of a dispute over a wealthy inheritance.  The real lesson of this mystery, however, is that the human mind is a poor random-number generator that inevitably fails to appreciate the nuances of truly random events.  In this story, Holmes uses the tell-tail signs of a concocted distribution of birthrates to deduce that a particular document is a forgery.<br />Who hasn't been exposed to supposed messages of seemingly profound importance, found encoded in the Bible?  In the case of the foolish graduate student, Holmes exposes the mathematics of hidden messages and prophecies coded in religious texts (or any other type, for that matter).  The main point is that, in almost any large body of text, the number of possibilities is so large as to make such coded messages a virtual certainty - if you look long and hard enough (you can even find them in things like software manuals).<br />There is hardly a more common human tendency than placing complicated entities in a linear hierarchy.  Witness, for example, the Sunday college-football rankings and the linear ranking of IQ scores.  The tendency is possibly rooted in our basic understanding of such things as elementary mathematics, where we are taught that if A is greater than B, and B is greater than C, then A is greater than C.  This is true for the set of real numbers, but is hardly true in general.  Bruce points out that in higher mathematics, A may be greater than B, and B may be greater than C, yet C may be greater than A.  It's really not a difficult concept.  Every child knows it well.  Paper wraps rock, rock breaks scissors, and scissors cuts paper.  The problem comes in internalizing the concepts and understanding where linear hierarchies don't apply.  Conmen make use of this error with simple games in which the mark gets to pick one of three dice.  Unsuspectingly, he fails to appreciate that, no matter which dice he picks, the con man can pick one of the remaining two, that will beat (on average have a higher score) whichever one the mark chooses.  The villain is no match for Holmes, though, who sees through the scam with clarity and dispatches his trademark logic to save a friend from his folly.<br />Many of the mysteries solved by Holmes have implications for public policy.  One such example is a case in which Holmes calculates the probability of a particular outcome of a drug test involving one of Dr. Watson's patients.  The results have wide application in public policy regarding drug testing.  The central theme is that it's possible for some tests to sound very reliable, and yet a large number of the positive tests are false, or a large number of the negative tests are true.  The results depend, in part, on the relative number of samples in the population that are using the drug, or have the illness that the drug is supposed to cure.<br />This book is easy to read, has no equations, and only a few figures.  It looks like, feels like, and reads like an honest-to-gosh mystery novel, but manages to illuminate many important aspects of logic and statistics at the same time.  I enjoyed reading it, and I'll bet you will, too.Con men make use of this error with simple games in which the mark gets to pick one of three dice.

Subjects of interest include waveguides made of optical fiber as well as planar waveguides in optical integrated circuits.  Issues include the modal distribution of optical energy in the waveguides, nonlinear effects, and the ability of the waveguide to transmit large amounts of data without degradation or errors.  Okamoto's book addresses all of these subjects in detail, forming a convenient single-source reference for the practicing scientist, engineer, or graduate student.<br />Okamoto's book is exceptionally well organized, and explains advanced and sometimes difficult concepts easily. The subject material and mathematical detail assume the reader to be well grounded in the basics of fiber optics, and able to work comfortably with differential, vector, and integral calculus.  In addition,  concepts such as Bessel functions, Maxwell's equations, and the nonlinear Schrodinger equation are used without introduction.  <br />Although not formally organized in parts, the subject matter can be broadly divided into three categories.  The first category consists of a basic treatment of waveguides in general, including the derivation of the functional forms of the eigenmodes in slab, rectangular, cylindrical, and coupled waveguides.  I found the discussion on coupled mode theory particularly useful.   Derivation of the eigenmodes is rigorous, with few simplifying assumptions.  The equations are generally in Cartesian coordinates, making them useful for general-purpose numerical simulations, which are discussed in detail later in the book.  Some of the more important equations should probably have been expressed in cylindrical coordinates as well, as this would make them more applicable for back-of-the envelope calculations.  Making the simplifications is not hard, however, and there are blank pages at the end of the book for customizing it with these additional equations.  Also lacking is a glossary of definitions of mathematical symbols used throughout the book. <br />The second category consists of specific, highly detailed and mathematically intense discussions about numerical methods used to solve the intensity distribution of light in inhomogeneous-core planar waveguides and fibers.  Topics include the beam propagation method, staircase concatenation method, and finite element method.  The discussions are sufficiently detailed that the capable and enthusiastic student should be able to write computer code that solves the propagation characteristics of virtually any arbitrary waveguide.  Although commercial software already does this, the background presented in Okamoto's book will be useful to the user of such software, providing insight as to how the software works, and its limitations.  <br />Straddling the discussion of numerical methods are discussions on nonlinear effects in optical fibers and planar lightwave circuits.   The discussion on nonlinear optics is one of the best single-chapter treatments of the subject that I've seen, with quantitative explanations of solitons (light and dark), self-phase modulation (the optical Kerr effect), Raman scattering, and Brillouin scattering.  There is also a brief discussion about optical amplification.  Surprisingly, however, the book fails to discuss four-wave mixing. The chapter on planar lightwave circuits is one of the best quantitative descriptions of the arrayed waveguide grating I've ever seen.  Overall, this is an excellent book that will be a valuable resource for scientists and engineers involved in fiber optics.  I highly recommend it.	2001-04-09
US	53038410	R8XIZAYNWYMWP	0962096326	184025762	By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus: A New Look at the Joseph Smith Papyri	Books	5	246	278	N	N	Must reading for anyone interested in the LDS Church	A fundamental claim of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) is that modern-day prophets who receive revelation from God lead the Church.  Accordingly, the Church lists as scripture (in addition to the Bible) several other books, including the Book of Mormon, The Book of Moses, The Book of Abraham, and the Doctrine &amp; Covenants (D&amp;C).  <br />Charles Larson's book is the story of how the Book of Abraham came to be.<br />Each of Smith's creations has a story to tell.  The Book of Mormon describes the ancient voyages of Hebrews to the American continent, and their establishment of a vast civilization that smelted iron, cultivated old-world crops, and used domesticated horses to pull chariots (see \\"Quest for the Gold Plates,\\" by Stan Larson).  The Book of Moses claims to be a direct revelation from God regarding the creation of the earth and some aspects of its early history.  The D &amp; C contains revelations pertaining to the day-to-day organization and operation of the Church, along with many important revelations about specific and unique doctrines held by the Church, such as polygamy.<br />Mormons claim that Smith translated the Book of Mormon from plates of gold that he acquired from an angel.  After translating the Book of Mormon, Smith said the angel retrieved the plates.  Consequently, the gold plates have never been available for skeptical or scientific examination.  The other books came directly from the mind of Joseph Smith.  So they, too, have no original text with which they can be compared.<br />The Book of Abraham stands unique among Smith's creations because Joseph Smith claimed to have translated it directly from ancient Egyptian scrolls that were purchased from a man named Chandler, who sold them to LDS Elders (along with other artifacts) for $2,400.  Unlike the vanished gold plates, the documents from which Joseph Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Abraham actually exist, and Joseph Smith's \\"translation\\" can be compared with the professional opinions of modern-day Egyptologists. <br />The Book of Abraham thus stands as a unique and direct test of Joseph Smith's self-proclaimed ability to translate ancient documents \\"by the gift and power of God.\\"  The main thrust of Charles Larson's book is that the Book of Abraham, and Joseph Smith, fail the test.<br />Larson begins by describing how Joseph Smith and the early LDS Saints came across the Egyptian papyri, how they were purchased, and how Joseph Smith began and finished his work of translation.  According to Joseph Smith none other than Abraham authored the writings on the papyrus.  They tell of the creation of the world and the universe, as well as important information about unique LDS beliefs such as the pre-mortal existence.  After Smith's murder, and the subsequent struggle for control of the Church, the collection of papyri became separated from the Saints, found their way to Chicago, and were presumed lost in the great Chicago fire.<br />Smith, however, included facsimiles of drawings from the papyri in the Book of Abraham. These allowed some measure of scientific examination which, unfortunately for the Church, resulted in early Egyptologists identifying them as nothing more than common Egyptian funerary documents.  Although devastating from a scholarly point of view, the Church was sequestered in the Utah frontier and the Saints and their leaders simply ignored these scientific opinions with their typical disdain for \\"the learning of the world.\\"  Furthermore, since the papyri had been presumed lost in the great Chicago fire, apologists for the Church argued that, without the entire collection available for examination, speculation based on the reproductions in the Book of Abraham were premature.<br />That changed in the spring of 1966 when Professor Aziz S. Atiya found eleven tattered pieces of Egyptian Papyri that matched the description of the Joseph Smith Papyri exactly.   On November 27, 1967 the Mormon-owned \\"Deseret News\\" announced that:<br /> \\"A collection of papyrus manuscripts, long believed to have been destroyed in the Chicago fire of 1871 was presented to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints here Monday by the Metropolitan Museum of Art ... Included in the papyri is a manuscript identified as the original document from which Joseph Smith had copied the drawing which he labeled \\"Facsimile No. 1\\" and published with the Book of Abraham.\\"<br />At first there was euphoria among Church scholars at the prospects of Joseph Smith's final vindication.  This hope was soon dashed to bits, however, as it became almost immediately obvious that nothing written on the papyri resembles anything in the Book of Abraham.  Undeterred, LDS apologists began a campaign of misinformation and apologetics.  Their campaign was so effective that in 1974 (nearly ten years after their discovery) when I served a mission for the LDS Church in British Columbia, we were still telling converts that the papyri had been destroyed in the great Chicago fire.<br />Not only does Larson assemble an air-tight argument that the found documents are the very same ones Smith gazed upon when he translated the Book of Abraham, he does a good job of assembling various other apologetic arguments, and discrediting them one by one.  <br />In writing this book Larson has provided perhaps the most comprehensive examination of the Book of Abraham available to the average reader.  It includes the first published full color photographs of the Papyri collection in a foldout glossy photograph.  It also has line-by-line translations by Egyptologists side-by-side with the \\"translation\\" given by Joseph Smith, an exhaustive appendix, notes section, and index.  All of which make this an useful book for future reference after its been read. <br />For anyone who is honestly committed to the truth about the LDS Church, this is a book that simply cannot go unread.	2001-02-20
US	53038410	RM1LZXSEZ7IF9	0831765992	866918988	The Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Old West	Books	5	5	5	N	N	Every ranch house should have one	Peter Newark's encyclopedia of the Old West covers people, places, and things west of the Mississippi River, and during the 19'th century.  As an encyclopedia, it covers subjects alphabetically, from \\"Abilene, Kansas\\" to \\"Zuni Indians.\\"  In addition, there is a brief introduction, a condensed table of major events, a table showing when the various states were admitted into the Union, a pretty nice map, and an alphabetical list of entries at the back of the book.  <br />The book tends to cover each topic in a somewhat truncated manner.  And, of course, it's not necessarily intended to be read cover to cover.  It's really the sort of book that should be left out on the coffee table, and read at odd times during the day, by kids, adults, and the occasional visitor who happens to notice it.  I find our copy wandering around the house, from room to room, as first one person, and then another, picks it up, reads a bit, and lays it down for the next curious interloper.<br />The book is nicely illustrated with black-and-white drawings and vintage photographs.  The photographs, in particular, help capture the flavor and essence of the Old West, from the image of hunters posing with their kill of a grizzly bear to a close up of one of the saddles used by the riders of the pony express.  Looking through some of these old photographs I could almost smell the dusty leather and the horse sweat that left it stained.  Some of the images are touching; others are gruesome.  Together, they paint a picture of rugged individualism garnished with frequent personal tragedy.  One photograph, in particular, touches me deeply.   It is that of the frozen corpse of Chief Big Foot, killed during the massacre at Wounded Knee.  <br />For me, this book resurrects memories of working my grandfather's ranch in northeast Utah, set against the foothills of the high Uinta Mountains, not far from Fort Bridger.  Although my grandfather (James Kent Olson) was born just after the end of the 19'th century,he instilled in me a love for the vanished lifestyle that died with the last of the cowboys.   Knowing my love for the Old West, my mother in law bought me this book for Christmas.  It's been one of the nicest presents I've had in a long time.<br />Having grown up with just a taste of the Old West, I immediately looked up Fort Bridger, which was just 30 miles from Grandfather's ranch.  As a kid I would sometimes go there with my aunts and cousins, and wonder what it must have been like to have live in the Wild West.  We had our horses, and we knew ranch work.  Still, it was a sanitized version, and I complained bitterly at having missed the opportunity to grow up in the \\"real\\" Old West.  My constant lamentations frequently left my flabbergasted mother to proclaim that I'd been born 100 years to late.<br />Next, I read the section on Butch Cassidy.  As a young boy I would coax my grandmother, Sara, to tell me about Butch Cassidy and his gang.  Butch supposedly had a hideout near the Green River gorge, not far from the ranch, and she would tell me stories about how Butch would ride through the area.  As a young boy I would take my horse up into the hills after cutting and stacking hay, and explore the canyons where wild daydreams filled my head of finding Butch's old hideout.  <br />Reading this book, I often felt transported me back in time.  Seeing a photograph of an old pair of spurs I found myself back on the ranch thirty years ago, in the old ranch-house kitchen with Grandmother as she set about cooking chicken wings for lunch.  With a creak the old screen door opened and then slammed as Grandfather came in from riding the irrigation ditch.  He took of his hat, stained with sweat, and slapped off the dust as he hung it in the entryway.  Coming across the old wood floor, I could hear his spurs ringing with each heavy footstep as he walked through the sunbeam that shone through the kitchen window, kissed Grandmother, and noted with approval the aroma of our noondaymeal.  <br />Flipping through the pages I came across a black-and-white photograph of an old Remington army pistol and suddenly found myself by Grandfather's side as he gazed along the sights at a rock sitting on a small knoll, the pistol held firmly in his big hands.  He took steel aim at the target with his deep blue eyes, and with a tremendous roar the gun discharged and the rock went sailing through the air.  He grinned at me with a knowing smile as the thick acrid smoke wafted away through the afternoon sunshine, and I realized, as I gazed across the green hayfields to the Wyoming badlands in the distance, what heaven must be like.<br />At almost every page I found nostalgia and the old ache that's stayed with me since I was 16 years and working that old ranch.  The world moves on.  Today, cowboys are just a dream.  That way of life is gone, but a part of it lives on in books like this, and particularly in the frozen moments in time that have been captured on film, leaving bits and pieces of clues about the way the Old West was fought, won, and drifted into history.	2001-02-13
US	53038410	R3W29S381PRCAC	0691005141	907152942	Gnomon	Books	4	20	20	N	N	Slow going, but worth it	According to Gazale', \\"Hero of Alexandria defined the gnomon as that figure (a number or a geometric figure) which, when added to another figure, results in a figure similar to the original.\\"  Gazale's book is, therefore, about self-similarity in numbers and geometry.<br />The subject sounds simple enough, but I found this to be a pretty tough book.  That might be partly due to the fact that I've always had a hard time focusing my attention on number theory.  This book has a lot of basic stuff about numbers, and I found much of that subject rather tedious and (dare I say it?) boring.  I know that's an ignorant thing to say - after all, mathematics is a beautiful subject in its own right, and there is some really neat stuff in number theory.  But it was still a tough book for me to wade through.<br />The introduction is mostly historical background, and a little truncated.  It serves primarily to illustrate a few basic concepts in self-similarity.  The author continues this theme with a short description of figurate and m-adic numbers.  Gazale tends to use more technical language than many casual readers are likely to recognize.  Yet this really isn't a book on formal mathematics, either.  It's really somewhere in between.  <br />Gazale often draws on themes from Martin Gardner's series of articles in Scientific American, and in some ways, his book reflects Gardner's style.  And, while much of this book seems focused on abstract details, there are occasional forays that illustrate amazing connections between what looks like pure mathematics and the real world.<br />Chapter 2, titled \\"Continued Fractions,\\" is foundational.  I really enjoyed this section, and think the book is worth having for this chapter alone.  Beginning with Euclid's algorithm, Gazale offers a natural introduction to continued fractions.  Then, in his characteristic style, he continues to explore every nook and cranny of this fascinating branch of mathematics.  Among the most pleasing results of this chapter is his demonstration of the mirrored similarity in the appearance of numbers as they are represented by continued fractions, and as they are represented by our traditional positional number system.  For example, he shows that both representations are always convergent and uniquely correspond to a number.  However, while infinite periodic representations correspond to rational numbers in the positional system, they correspond to quadratic irrationals in the system of continue fractions.  And, while transcendental and irrationals are infinite nonperiodic representations in both systems, there are some beautiful expressions of some transcendental numbers in the system of continued fractions that left me mesmerized.<br />One particularly nice feature is the way the author summarizes the important equations at the back of each chapter.  Some of these summaries are several pages long, and they actually do a good job of encapsulating the essential material.  In fact, the summaries are so well done that, if you read the book, you probably will be able to go back and use the formulas in the back of the chapters without having to refer back to the text.<br />If you ever wanted to know about the Fibonacci sequence, I can hardly imagine a book that will satisfy you better than this one.  The first thing you will learn is that the Fibonacci sequence you met in grade school is just a small subset of a more general form.  Then, in a whirlwind of mathematical activity you will see the general recursive formula (which depends, of course, on the seed and gnomonic numbers).  This is followed by explicit formulae for the terms of the sequence and even a demonstration of how some of these equations, in the limit, model the behavior of wave propagation in an electronic transducer ladder, and the movement of a ganged series of pulleys.<br />A continuing source of amazement is the way in which the mathematical themes in this book are so interconnected.  That's fitting, I suppose, for a book called Gnomon.  In the chapter on whorled figures we see many of the other subjects in this book reappearing.  <br />The book also has an excellent chapter on the golden number, and another on the silver number.  The golden number, as you may know, shows up all over the place, and not just in Gazale's book.  Here, he connects it with the Fibonacci sequence, whorled spirals, and golden rectangles.  And for every example using the golden number, not surprisingly, there is another using the silver number.  It's fascinating to read of all the ways in which these numbers shows up, and try to contemplate the underlying order that makes it happen this way.<br />Things get a little more abstract toward the end of the book (but no less interesting), and a bit harder to read.  There are some very interesting developments with spirals and the rotation matrix, along with some interesting construction techniques for making your own spirals with paper and pen.<br />The last chapter, on fractals, exercised my little gray cells more than the rest of the book.  This is not your typical discussion about fractals, with pretty pictures and non-technical explanations about self-similarity at any level.  While Gazale does not dive in with the sort of mathematical rigor to which a pure mathematician would aspire, he claims to have written an unusual chapter on the subject, derived directly from number-theoretic considerations.  This chapter will keep you busy following all the ins and outs of some pretty involve matrix mathematics.  If you like the fast-Fourier algorithm, I think you'll love it.<br />This book is definitely not for everyone.  But if you really, really like mathematics, and especially number-theoretic mathematics, I think you will like it.  It will most definitely exercise your mind, but then again, that's what a good book on mathematics is supposed to do.  Isn't it?	2001-02-08
US	53038410	R3RCU5G1R1RIP7	0195135156	53004101	Voodoo Science: The Road from Foolishness to Fraud	Books	5	12	17	N	N	How to think like a scientist	Park's stated purpose in writing this book is \\"to help the reader to recognize voodoo science and to understand the forces that seem to conspire to keep it alive.\\" [Page 10.]  He approaches this goal by first defining his terms - something that not all writers of general science books remember to do.  According to Park, pathological science is when scientists manage to fool themselves.  Pseudoscience is when people develop myths that use scientific terminology or pretend to be based on scientific principles, but are nothing more than the modern-day equivalent of witches and faith healers.  Junk science consists of arguments deliberately constructed to fool non-scientists like jurists and/or lawmakers.  Park uses the term \\"voodoo science\\" to apply to all of them. <br />Park also adopts E. O. Wilson's definition of science as being \\"the systematic enterprise of gathering knowledge about the world and organizing and condensing that knowledge into testable laws and theories.\\"<br />With the exception of chapter two, almost the entire book consists of different stories about how practitioners of voodoo science sell their wares.  Chapter one also serves as a sort of summary of what's to come, with previews of cold fusion, perpetual motion machines, and the Patterson cell.<br />Chapter two, called \\"The Belief Engine,\\" explains the evolutionary pressures that led to our ability to find patterns, and how that ability fosters belief in things that may or may not be true.  Sprinkled throughout the rest of the book are examples of the belief engine, with reference back to chapter two, reminding the reader of what is going on as Park explains the workings of voodoo science.<br />Chapter three is about the placebo effect, with examples from the sellers of \\"Vitamin O\\" and Homeopathy.  A key principle in Homeopathy is that \\"substances that produce a certain set of symptoms in a healthy person can cure those symptoms in someone who is sick.\\"  A second principle is that the less of the curative material one uses, the better its curative effect.  Homeopathy thus engages itself with extreme dilution of the \\"medicine.\\"  With determined logic and reason, Park illustrates that the amount of medicine used in the dilution results in less than one molecule per dose.  In other words, \\"there is no medicine in the medicine.\\"  Homeopathy is based on nothing more than the placebo effect.  That's a real effect, to be sure.  The voodoo science comes about in failing to understand that there is nothing else to it.<br />Chapters four and nine deal with aspects of voodoo science that take their breath from our modern scientific culture.  There are examples of people who argue that manned space flight is the best way to do space science.  Park eloquently illustrates that space science is - and probably always will be - most efficiently accomplished using space robots.  But that is not what inspires politicians and the American public, and so we waste billions of dollars on manned space missions ostensibly in the name of space science.  Chapter nine is similar, but deals with the junk science that often hides behind official secrecy in the armed forces.  The primary example in this chapter is that of Star Wars.  <br />Perpetual motion and cold fusion take up significant portions of the book.  Chapter five, for example, is a condensed version of the cold-fusion story, complete with some rather interesting stories about congressional testimony.  The other half of the chapter describes congressional action regarding perpetual-motion machines and Joe Newman (perpetual motion and infinite energy are also discussed in chapter six).  One of the highlights is the story of how Senator John Glenn said to Newman: \\"It's a simple enough problem.  You measure the input and you measure the output and you see which is larger.\\"  Glenn then asked Newman which laboratory he wanted to do the tests.  Newman replied that \\"he objected to any tests by any laboratory on the grounds that itwould be an affront to the scientists who had already vouched for his machine.\\"<br />Such are the characteristics of voodoo science.  They almost always deal with phenomena that are at the edge of detectabilty, there is a perpetual lack of progress, and skeptical inquirers and independent verification are not welcome.<br />Chapter seven is a most interesting account of the story of electromagnetic fields, power lines, and cancer.  Park had some personal involvement in this field, and his accounts make for very interesting reading.  With characteristic focus he illustrates how the pandemonium over power lines was derived from the classic situations and driving forces that characterize voodoo science, and how the evidence eventually settled the issue, but the myths and fears live on. <br />Peppered throughout the book are illustrations of illogical reasoning that forms the basis of voodoo science.  One such case is the persistent reliance upon \\"possibilities\\" without evidence (what you might call wishful thinking).  Park closes his book with a short but illuminating chapter on how scientists deal with possibilities. <br />This is an excellent book for introducing people to what it means to think like scientists.  What the world really needs are more people that actually think and organize knowledge the way scientists do.  This is illustrated with an amazing story of how a 9-year-old girl named Emily Rosa thought up a simple double-blind test to determine if certain mystics can actually feel the presence of another body without touching it.  She though like a scientist, performed the experiment, organized the data, and formed the logical conclusion that they cannot do what they claim to do.  And then she had here results published in the  \\"Journal of the American Medical Association,\\" becoming the youngest scientist ever to publish in a paper in a major medical journal.  If only more Americans could think like Emily, we'd have far less voodoo science to worry about.	2001-01-04

I had a tough time getting through the introduction and first chapter, and nearly set the book aside for something else.  The problem is that the first part of the book has lots of bad philosophy, and some bad science.  For example, Lockley tells us in the introduction that <br />\\"... a mystical or intuitive approach to understanding existence is not incompatible with a scientific one.\\" <br />He then explains how scientists sometimes find insights through intuition.  He fails to illustrate, however, that (unlike mysticism) an essential element of the scientific method is independent, skeptical validation and review.   <br />Lockley's personal penchants for things like palm reading are found at both the beginning and end of the book.  For example, on page 22 he says: <br />\\"There is evidence that palms and hand shapes fall into various categories that reveal much of the character of the person.  In palmistry an elongate hand is regarded as a sign of the gift of high intelligence, sensitivity, intuition, and psychic ability, whereas a stout hand, of the type sometimes called the square or useful hand, is a sign of a `salt of the earth' commonsense personality.\\"  <br />He makes the connection between palmistry and footprints by explaining how footprints reflect on the whole being.  For example, he explains that Celtic feet tend to be longer and narrower than wide-footed Saxons, and that this can give insight into mental characteristics of these two groups of people.  For example, on page 23, he writes:  <br />\\"As we shall see, inherent qualities are also associated with narrowness and breadth, so we might infer from their foot shape that ancient Celts were more intuitive and mystical, whereas Saxons more practical and down to earth.\\"<br />There are also some serious technical errors in the book.  For example, on page 32 he says: <br />\\"In her seminal work Ho reiterates the known maxim that living organisms defy entropy, the tendency of systems to run down, by transcending the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that all inanimate matter decays to equilibrium or \\"heat death.\\"  <br />This is misleading and false.  Living things do not posses some mystical capability to \\"transcend\\" the laws of thermodynamics.  These laws apply to all matter, with no exceptions.  Bogus arguments about thermodynamics are common among mythologists and creationist, and I was rather surprised and disappointed to find Lockley using some of them. <br />Fortunately the book improves once you get past the first part, with the rest of the book being mostly a discussion of fossil footprints down through the ages in a more or less chronological order.  This was what I'd been looking for in the first place.  It's just too bad that there's so much other stuff mixed in with what's actually a very interesting subject.  <br />The story of the tracks begins almost at the beginning, with Trilobite pirouettes and worm trails from the Precambrian, along with some quite interesting discussions about tracks left by monster millipedes and the earliest land animals.  Once again, however, Lockley makes a serious technical error, when, on page 53 he says: <br />\\"It is fun to suggest that these ancestors of wood lice were stunned by the sheer enormity of their pioneering explorations on land.  Dazed by sudden exposure to atmospheric pressure, they were still finding their land legs.\\"  <br />At first, I thought Lockley must have been joking, but he later describes discussing (in apparent seriousness) this very idea with a class of students.  Any physicist will realize that atmospheric pressure is felt below the surface of a lake, just as it is right above the surface.  The pressure increases below water, but in a continuous way.  The first organisms to leave the seas had lots of things with which to contend, but a sudden change in pressure (assuming they were not deep-water organisms) was not one of them.  And while Lockley seems to think that animals emerging from the sea would have been suddenly exposed to an increase in pressure, the opposite is actually the case.  The total pressure under water is higher than the atmospheric pressure at the surface.<br />A good part of the rest of the book consists of examples of track ways, including some interesting personal stories about famous tracks that have been found and preserved.  There is a nice discussion about phantom tracks that occur when a footprint is transferred to layers below the one on which the animal trod (sort of like making a carbon copy) and some very interesting accounts of footprints from the Holocene and Pleistocene - including horses and camels.  One of the most interesting parts of the book is the section that deals with footprints of our earliest ancestors.<br />Throughout the book are examples of the author's belief that footprints exhibit clues about the whole animal, including such things as similarities between the shapes of hoofs and the shapes of horns.  I find this interesting, and entirely plausible, but I wish the author had provided a more secure scientific basis for the claim.  He frequently draws comparisons with a relatively small set of animals, for which the conclusions all hold quite nicely, but he fails to provide a more complete basis for drawing general conclusions.  <br />When Lockley sticks with the subject of tracking and footprints he can be very engaging and quite informative.  But he injects his personal philosophy so often that I found it distracting - especially when he starts making erroneous statements about atmospheric pressure and the laws of thermodynamics.  Still, I'm glad I took the time to read his book.  It made me think, and it taught me some things I didn't know before.	2001-01-04
US	53038410	R3Q2EYBQMDJNAH	0879802391	38155822	Practical Guide to Horseshoeing	Books	5	19	19	N	N	a lot of information in a small package.	This book is a reprint of a small book called `The Horseshoer,\\" which was a reprint of the War Department Technical Manual No. 2-220.  It's worth owning this book just for its historical interest and value.  It's not a long book - just a little more than 200 pages, but it's full of some of the most interesting and practical information you could want.  <br />The book begins with a short description of the basic anatomy and physiology of a horse's foot.  Most of the illustrations are clear, but there are some that are difficult to read.  The book not only describes how the foot is constructed, but how it works.  The horse's foot has always amazed me, and I found this to be one of the most interesting parts of the book.  Included in this chapter are some nice figures that show toe-in, straight, and toe-out confirmations.<br />The next section is really quite interesting.  It describes the tools used to make the horseshoes from raw iron stock, as well as to fit them to the foot.  The figures here are clear and easy to read, with descriptions of the tools and what they are used for.  There are the anvil, clinch cutter, forge, rounding hammer, driving hammer, hardy, farrier's knife, creaser, cutting nippers, pincers, hoof parer, farrier's tongs, rasp, pritchel, shoeing box, fire shovel, fire rake, and box-leg vice.  There is also a good discussion on machine-made shoes, describing weights and sizes.  And, of course, there is a nice discussion about nails, showing different sizes and views.<br />Most readers probably won't use section 4, unless you are a real purist.  Section 4 describes how to make horseshoes from bar iron or steel.  This chapter is really interesting, and I'd like some day to try making my own shoes, but it takes some pretty specialized skill and equipment.  This section has some detailed descriptions about the different parts of the shoe and gives specific detailed instructions about how to form the shoe from a straight bar of material.  Section 5 continues the theme with a discussion of borium-treated horseshoes for longer life.  This is an interesting piece of history, as encapsulated in the opening paragraph of the section: \\"Research is being made by various agencies at the disposal of the War Department to develop a method of treating horseshoes with some form of very hard material which will prevent slipping and at the same time increase the wearing qualities on hard surfaced roads.\\"  <br />Section 6 is where the book gets down to business, and describes the fundamentals of nailing on the shoe.  You can learn a lot from this chapter, but it's best to use what you learn from the book in conjunction with an expert horseshoer.  You can do serious damage to a horse by driving the nails incorrectly, or by shaping the hoof incorrectly and throwing it out of balance.  This is definitely one of those subjects that can be improved by reading a book, but never learned by reading a book.  There are some excellent figures in this section showing the preparation of the foot, and for those who might not actually shoe the horse, this section offers some useful information for trimming.  This section also has some very useful information on corrective shoeing.<br />The book has some good summary information on care of feet and how to deal with horses that are shy with their feet and/or kick.  The book ends with a short set of questions with answers that serve to summarize the most important points.  And, it has an excellent index.   If you like doing things the cowboy way, or if you just want a little bit of history on your bookshelf, I recommend this book.  It's practical and jam packed full of information.  I've used it extensively with my own horses.  It's a lot of information in a small package.	2000-12-25
US	53038410	R3SJ238A21IWIO	0521485231	290807164	Complex Variables: Introduction and Applications (Cambridge Texts in Applied Mathematics)	Books	5	49	52	N	N	A complete reference book for complex variables	Whether you are a student, or just in need of a good reference text, Mark J. Ablowitz' and Athanassios Fokas' book belongs in your library.  Complex Variables, Introduction and Applications is refreshingly well written.  In clear and logical flow, the authors present the subject of complex variables in an easy-to-understand, yet complete format suitable for both students and practicing professionals.  <br />This text offers a broad coverage of the subject, from fundamental properties of complex numbers, analytic functions, and singularities to more advanced topics such as conformal mapping and Riemann-Hilbert problems.  Although individuals interested in pure mathematics may find some of the proofs insufficiently rigorous, those using the book as a reference for engineering or scientific problems may find the text too rigid.  Overall, however, the authors have done an excellent job balancing the subject matter and successfully achieving their goal of, when necessary, &quot;sacrificing a rigorous axiomatic development with a logical development based upon suitable assumptions.&quot;<br />Although the mathematical development of the text is clear, concise, and easy to follow, many of the applied examples, such as those for uniform flow in section 2.1, would benefit from further physical insight.  Individuals already familiar with physics will have no difficulty following many of the examples, and extending them to other situations.  Those less grounded in the physical sciences, however, may find the starting equations for some of the examples to be less than intuitive.  Though additional explanations would increase the book's already substantial heft, the change would benefit many readers.<br />It is a joy to read a well-written technical book with almost no typographical or technical errors.  Except for minor (and easily recognizable) typographical errors such as that in equation 2.2.12b, the book is nearly flawless.  This leaves the student free to concentrate on learning the material unencumbered by worries about the text's accuracy.<br />The index is nicely composed, complete, and accurate.  This makes the book particularly useful as a reference.  Typically, the reader will have little trouble using the index to go directly to the pages of most interest and applicability regarding the subject of inquiry.  It would be nice to see a more complete bibliography, as well as a summary of common symbols.  Especially useful would be a summary of some of the more important equations (such as Green's theorem, Cauchy's theorem, the Fourier transform, the Helmholtz equation, etc.) derived or demonstrated in  the book.  A list of important equations, particularly, would improve the book's utilization as a desk reference.<br />For the student, the text presents answers to odd-numbered questions in the back of the book.  For the most part, the text presents only the answers, but occasionally the authors provide additional insight into the problem's solution, as in section 5.2.  This will be useful for those engaged in independent study.<br />Overall, this is an excellent text, and one of the most complete and well-written books on complex variables I have seen.  I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject, and have placed it prominently upon my reference bookshelf.	2000-12-11
US	53038410	R26G3LPIJVB0A1	1573453943	598849038	Of Heaven and Earth: Reconciling Scientific Thought With Lds Theology	Books	1	18	52	N	N	Not what it claims to be	Few religions invite critical analysis more than the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons).  Although Mormon leaders were initially bullish on the prospects of vindication in the eyes of science, today they speak of  &quot;the ever-present challenge from the so-called scholars or intellectuals.&quot;  [Talk to the All-Church Coordinating Council, Apostle Boyd K. Packer, May 18, 1993]<br />Clark's book is intended to placate the fears of Mormons who fear their religion is inconsistent with modern science, and to reconcile &quot;scientific thought with LDS theology.&quot; It is surprising, therefore, that the most notable thing about this book is the way it ignores its principal thesis.   It not only fails to reconcile scientific thought with LDS theology, it hardly even touches the subject. The book studiously avoids any detailed and specific examination of real conflicts between Mormonism and science, focusing instead on out-dated arguments and nebulous philosophical concerns. <br />For example, there is no discussion about any of the major problems with the Book of Mormon, such as its claims for great ancient-American civilizations that domesticated chariot-pulling horses, raised old-world fruits and grains, had domesticated cattle, used elephants, wrote in Hebrew and Egyptian, and smelted iron and steel.  [See Stan Larson, &quot;Quest for the Gold Plates: Thomas Stuart Ferguson's Archaeological Search for the Book of Mormon.&quot;]  There is no discussion of the problems with the Book of Abraham, and the near certainty that the scrolls Joseph Smith claimed to have translated were nothing more than common funerary prayers, and that his &quot;translation&quot; has absolutely nothing to do with what's written on them.  [See Charles Larson, &quot;By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus: A New Look at the Joseph Smith Papyri.&quot;]  Nor do the contributors adequately deal with the Church's public teachings denigrating organic evolution as a doctrine of the devil.Although the book's jacket suggests a resolution between science and Mormon doctrines that preach of a literal worldwide flood (which was the earth's baptism), there are just a few brief sentences on the subject.  And there is virtually no reconciliation between science and the Mormon doctrine that the earth's continents were literally split roughly 4,000 years ago.<br />The book's points can be roughly summarized as follows:<br />1) Generic arguments purporting to show the existence of God, and focusing mostly on arguments about design.<br />2) Implied arguments from authority in the form of personal testimonies and conversion stories.<br />3) Arguments purporting to put all conclusions out of reach, and pleading with the reader not to reject Mormonism until everything is known.<br />4) Arguments to the effect that Mormonism has no official position on the subject of evolution.<br />Although several of the contributors argue for a generic creator, none of them speak directly to specific problems involving the traits Mormons attribute to God.  In fact they seem to make a point of ignoring them.  For example, Joseph Smith (who founded Mormonism) taught:<br />&quot;... I am going to tell you how God came to be God. We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea, and take away the veil, so that you may see. ... He was once a man like us; yea, that God himself, the Father of us all, dwelt on an earth....&quot; [History of the Church, Joseph Smith, Vol. 6.]<br />This description calls for an explanation of how God could be the creator of a universe in which he, himself, evolved in his pre-divine existence.  Or how a physical God with a head roughly the same size as yours or mine could have infinite knowledge.  Yet these subjects are studiously avoided throughout the book.  Instead, the contributors make sweeping and vague arguments for a generic creator using arguments about design that are similar to those used by the institute for creation research (a fundamentalist Christian organization devoted to a literal translation of the Bible).  <br />Several of the contributors argue that science cannot prove anything, and that until it does, open-minded people will refrain from concluding that Mormonism is false on the basis of perceived contradictions at present.  The most remarkable thing about these arguments is that they are so broad they can be used to justify belief in anything.<br />A few contributors argue that God used evolution to create bodies for mankind.  However, in doing so they fail to deal with the fact that evolution is a natural, undirected process, and that evolution does not need God to create species anymore than rivers need God to create canyons, or the moon needs God to orbit the earth.  <br />Other contributors argue that the Mormon Church has no official policy regarding evolution.  For example, Bart Kowallis quotes a private letter from President McKay to William Stokes, claiming that the Church has no official policy in the matter.  In doing so, however, Kowallis fails to inform the reader that McKay equated &quot;evolution&quot; with &quot;change,&quot; and that McKay rejected evolution as a process that did not require God's interference.   Kowallis also studiously avoids the vast number of statements from high-ranking Mormon leaders who have said things like:<br />&quot;There is no harmony between the truths of revealed religion and the theories of organic evolution.&quot;  (Bruce R. McConkie, &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;, p. 256)	2000-11-06
US	53038410	R18PM3KT59NL1Q	0871319047	162067141	Bones: A Forensic Detective's Casebook	Books	5	39	42	N	N	Forensic anthropology	This is one of the most interesting books I've read in a long while.  It's about forensic anthropology.  If the title sounds boring, don't be mislead.  Ubelaker has done a masterful job of interweaving the science of forensic anthropology with some really interesting detective stories.  The result is a wonderful blend of story telling, murder mystery, and science rolled into one.<br />One of the first things I liked about this book is that Ubelaker talks to the reader using the same correct anatomical names of bones that you'd expect from one of the foremost experts in the field (which he is).  That's not to say the text comes across stuffy or condescending.  On the contrary.  I got the feeling that even though I'm a complete novice in this area Ubelaker has treated me, the reader, with enough respect to speak to me in correct terms, while putting at my disposal the means to catch up with his vocabulary.  For example, he put a glossary of terms at the end of the book, and a simple sketch of a human skeleton, so you can look up the funny sounding words and find out what they mean.  The ulna and radius, for example, are the two bones in your forearm.  The talus is one of the bones in your ankle.  I always appreciate an author who educates me.  Someone who makes me learn something new.  But I especially appreciate that person when they make the learning process interesting and natural.  Not all authors do that, and fewer still do it well.<br />You might expect a book on forensic anthropology to be laid out in topical chapters.  One chapter might tell you all about the names of the bones.  Another might discuss characteristic marks on bones from knives, etc.  Still another might discuss the technical details of decomposition.  Well, Ubelaker does all that, but he does it without you actually realizing that it's happening.  He does it by constructing virtually the entire book out of case histories from his personal experience.  These case histories are grouped, roughly,into chapters that each teaches a different concept.  But he does not teach by recitation of fact and rot memorization.  Instead, these case histories are laid out like miniature crime mysteries, with Ubelaker walking the reader through the story, showing how the bones hold the key to the mystery, and explaining how they tell their story.<br />This isn't a textbook, though I wouldn't be surprised to find it on a list of recommended reading for an anthropology class.  Rather it is a book meant to introduce first-time readers to the subject in an interesting and informative manner.  It's meant to both initiate interest in the subject as well as to inform.  <br />I learned a lot of interesting things from Ubelaker's book.  For example, I had no idea that anthropologists can tell different human groups apart from their skeletal remains.  I'd always assumed that we look pretty much the same under our skins, but that's not the case.  Telling men from women is pretty easy, and telling the difference between European, Mongoloid, and African origin is not too difficult, either. Little clues about which bones have fused together, the size of nasal openings, and the widths of certain bones allow anthropologists to make remarkably accurate determinations when they have a well-preserved full skeleton.  And, depending on circumstances, they can even tell age with a pretty good level of confidence. Even when the amount of bone is very limited, I was surprised at some of his examples of the wealth of information that could be inferred.<br />Some of the case stories involve especially poignant human tragedies (every human death is a tragedy, but the stories of some of the victims tear at your heartstrings a little harder than do others).  At first Ubelaker seems a little detached in his telling of some of these stories.  But as I worked my way through the book it became clear that he is a first-rate professional, and that beneath the academic exterior there is a kind and compassionate heart that understands the human component of his work, and treats it with the utmost respect and dignity. <br />This book is about death, and the application of science in determining the cause of death based on examination of corpses.  Some of the descriptions are graphic, and there are definitely some chapters you won't want to read during a meal.  One of the questions that puzzled me during the beginning of the book was how scientists are able to determine, based on the degree of decomposition, how long a body had been dead.  Science is based on experimentation, you know, and this area is no different than others.  Make sure when you read that chapter you're not eating a sandwich.<br />The book has about 300 pages and it's illustrated with black and white drawings and a few black and white photographs.  I found it very engaging.  I picked it up at the Portland airport just before a trip to Boston.  Five days later, when I returned to Oregon, I'd finished it.  If you like a good mystery, practical applications of the scientific method, and if you have some interest in crime, forensics, or anthropology, I think you will be as fascinated by this book as I am.	2000-10-23
US	53038410	RUW39R4G2A9HD	0521651956	344901211	Cosmic Catastrophes: Supernovae, Gamma-ray Bursts, and Adventures in Hyperspace	Books	5	37	38	N	N	The biggest explosions	There seems to be an aspect of human nature that wants to search out and discover things that are the most extreme in their class. People just seem to love record setters.  This is a book about cosmic record setters.  Within its pages Wheeler describes the biggest, most energetic, oldest, densest, things in the universe. If cosmic record holders hold any interest for you, then I think you'll find this book as enjoyable as I did.<br />Wheeler begins his book by describing how stars form, how they evolve in response to gravity, how they ignite, how they burn, and eventually how they die.  This is a logical introduction, since virtually all the examples of cosmic catastrophes involve stars in one form or another.  Like people, though, the life of each star is unique - and the end times are very different.  Wheeler does an excellent job of describing the negative feedback process that stabilizes solar activity. If the star generates too much heat it expands.  This expansion reduces the temperature, and throttles back on the rate of nuclear fusion. If the star cools down it contracts, and the contraction heats it up again, keeping the rate of fusion at a remarkably constant level for long periods of time during the stars life.<br />Much of Wheeler's text is actually about how stars evolve.  This is important because to understand their deaths, you need to understand how they are born and how they evolve over their lifetimes.  Their deaths are frequently the most interesting parts of the story because they are often involved with the catastrophes that are the book's principal thesis.  While I bought the book because of its discussion about cosmic catastrophes, I found it valuable for its descriptions of stellar evolution alone.  This includes a nice description of the &quot;solar-neutrino&quot; problem as well as a nice explanation of the red-giant phase, and especially the last stages during the life of a massive star that explodes in a super nova.<br />The foundationalunderstanding of the basics of stellar evolution makes it easier to follower Wheeler as he takes the reader on a tour of the major players in cosmic catastrophes: white dwarfs, super novae (of many different types), neutron stars, black holes, and gamma-ray bursts.  Wheeler's descriptions of these phenomena (to the extent that modern science understands them) are among the best I've seen in a popular science textbook.  There is also a smattering of discussion about the origin of the universe in the Big Bang, and some interesting speculation about time (and space) travel using black holes.<br />In any book dealing with modern cosmology and astronomy there are inevitable discussions about the nature of space and time and how they fit together with Einstein's theory of general relativity.  Most such books have at least one figure showing a funnel-shaped construct with grid lines converging as they swoop into the tapering end where the black hole resides.  Wheeler uses lots of such diagrams.  However, I think he does a better job than most at helping the reader understand what the diagrams illustrate.  More importantly, he helps the reader understand what the diagrams do not illustrate, and their limitations (he dispels some common misperceptions about these sorts of figures).  I especially enjoyed Wheeler's explanations about how one might (with the application of the appropriate mental acrobatics) use the diagrams to actually envision what is really going on in our multi-dimensional world.<br />Another thing I liked about Wheeler's book is the clear and frequent illustrations.  For the most part the author has anticipated those places where prose just cannot quite complete the mental picture.  When this happens there is inevitably a well-constructed diagram that finishes the concept and makes things clear.  There was one exception, however.  Figure 7.3 really needs to have an arrow or circle marking the location of SN 1987A.  [I'm pretty sure I found it, but the exposure changes between the photographs, and so I'm not quite sure.  It would have been nice to have the author's help in preventing a false identification.]<br />Reading this book one gets the sense that even though it is a qualitative description of astronomy (there are no equations) Wheeler is not over simplifying.  His discussion of super novae, for example, lists many classes and describes theoretical uncertainties that other authors gloss over or ignore all together.  Of course there is much more detail to super novae than what is in Wheeler's book.  But at the qualitative level Wheeler leaves the reader understanding that there are many classifications of super novae, that some of the boundaries between classifications are not always so clear cut, and that we still don't know a lot about how some types form, and how other types explode.  These are concepts that other popular science textbooks don't always convey.  I think the only thing missing from the chapters on super novae is a table that summarizes all the different types and some of their descriptive identifiers.<br />Unlike some popular science texts, Wheeler devotes quite a bit of time describing the evolution of binary stars, which play an important role in some of the greatest cosmic catastrophes.  I think he does an especially good job of qualitatively describing accretion disks, and how they fit in the context of mass transfer in binary systems.  It's this mass transfer that is ultimately involved in some of the most spectacular catastrophes in the sky.<br />Overall, this is a great book.  If you enjoy astronomy I'm sure you will find it satisfying and informative.  It's just the sort of book to enjoy on a vacation, or after a grueling day at the office.	2000-10-06

The first part is a qualitative introduction to integrated semiconductor electronics (with emphasis on transistor junctions).  The second part focuses on solid state quantum physics with emphasis on optical as well as electrical properties.  There is also a smattering of material on super conducting materials and some basic material about how a digital computer works.  The author's intended audience is the high school student or first-year college student who wants to pursue a degree in the sciences.  An alternate audience is the informed layman who wants to be up to date at a qualitative level with recent advances in electronics and future directions in research and development.  <br />I believe the book is well written for the intended audience.  Turner has an easy-to-read style, and he manages to explain things (generally) in a technically accurate way without the use of mathematics.  Without the mathematical details this book is not what you'd expect in a design reference - and that's not what it's intended for.  But it is an excellent book to read in advance of a rigorous quantitative class on the subject.  I think it's much easier to understand physical phenomena in mathematical detail if one first obtains a qualitative &quot;feel&quot; for what's going on.<br />Turner opens his book with two short chapters on matter and the origin of conductivity.  He spends the next few chapters describing p-n junctions, how they are used to make transistors, and issues that limit their size and speed.   Along the way he shows how transistors are used in computers both in the fabrication of basic logic elements, and also in the venerable &quot;flip-flop&quot; memory cell.  His descriptions are clear and concise, making liberal use of figures and diagrams so that the concepts can be grasped with no particular pre-existing skills in physics or electronics.  <br />The explanation of present semiconductor physics sets the stage for later discussions about the motivation for semiconductor devices at the quantum level.  He does a good job of illustrating the fact that quantum-dominated semiconductor devices will not simply be miniaturized versions of the devices populating current integrated circuits.  The physics would not allow it.  Rather, they will be unique devices that are designed and custom tailored using quantum theory from the ground up.  The result will be new devices that have similar - though often dramatically different - operating characteristics, and that are orders of magnitude smaller than present devices, as well as faster.  <br />In illustrating the classical and quantum semiconductor circuits, Turner does a nice job of laying out the basic ideas behind these devices.   In qualitative prose, he explains the exclusion principle, how it applies to fermions, and how the exclusion principle in conjunction with quantized energy states results in many of the phenomena that we observe in semiconductor devices.  Turner's description of the optical properties of semiconductors flows naturally from earlier discussions.  He describes the basic ideas behind a laser, though in this regard I found the descriptions somewhat lacking.  Other interesting groundwork is provided in his descriptions of tunneling and Compton pairs (which are involved in super conducting).<br />A nice feature is the glossary of terms, along with a nice list of further reading material and a good index.  The book is also well illustrated throughout, with figures that add considerably to one's level of understanding.  I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in a qualitative introduction to solid-state physics, electronics, or semiconductor optics.  I found it enjoyable to read and rich in the sort of qualitative imagery and description that makes learning so much more enjoyable.	2000-10-06

I picked up a copy of Whittlesey's book while on vacation in Yellowstone  in July of 2000.  The cover captured my attention because the day before  two of my kids narrowly escaped becoming statistics.  <br />We had just  entered the park through the northwest gate when, as we were driving along,  we spotted our first plumes of steam.  Anxious to begin exploring we eased  the camper onto the side rode and drove to a parking spot, pulling off the  road near a dirt trail that led to the hot spring.  <br />As usual, my kids  were out of the car in a flash and dashing down the trail where they  immediately set up a game of tag, darting around the edge of the boiling  water.   Also, as usual, I got out of the car and hollered after them to  &quot;get back here and settle down.&quot;  This time, though, I was a bit  more concerned because as I drew near the hot spring I could see it  bubbling and steam was rising off the surface.  Again, I yelled after the  kids to settle down, but they just ignored me and continued their game of  tag.  <br />Knowing the water was probably hot I decided to test it.  With  calculation I quickly dipped the index finger of my right hand into the  pool up to the first knuckle, withdrawing it as fast as I could.  What I  felt sent terror up my spine - it was the cutting pain and persistent dull  ache of scalding, boiling water.  <br />My perspective changed in an instant.   I no longer saw the water as a clear, sparkling, blue-green emerald, but as  a death trap more dangerous than a gaping hole thousands of feet deep.   Just then Jacob and Christopher flew around the corner, and darted between  the pool and me.  Jacob tottered but regained his balance and, with a  holler of delight, and scampered quickly to escape Christopher who was in  hot pursuit.<br />Using the most authoritarian and urgent language in my  vocabulary, I shouted at the kids to get away NOW!  Jacob and Christopher  stopped.  They recognized that tone of voice and the twitchthat develops  in my left eye when I mean business.  They moved away from the hot spring,  and for the next 15 minutes endured a parental lecture on what it would  mean to be dunked in boiling water.  I described third degree burns over  their entire bodies, flesh that comes off the bones like a boiled chicken,  a scalded esophagus, blindness and certain death after languishing for  hours in the hospital's burn center as parents and siblings wept in the  waiting room. <br />Being kids, they looked at me askew, doubting my warnings  and admonitions while calculating the price of defiance.  They obeyed, if  not with reluctance, and stayed by my side as we visited the rest of (a  small sampling of) the park's geothermal features.  Wanting backup,  however, I was immediately convinced when I read the first few pages of the  first chapter in Whittlesey's book.  I bought it on the spot, and read it  in less than a week.  The kids read it too, and finished it with a new  appreciation for minding their father's warning in the wilderness.<br />The  book is divided into two parts.  Part 1 talks about how people have died in  the park from nature.  This includes things like falling into hot springs,  getting killed by wild animals (bison and bears, mostly), poisonous plants,  noxious fumes from geothermal vents, lightning, falling trees, fires, etc.    Part 2 describes how people have died from human-related causes such as  accidents, fights, murder, getting kicked by horses, and even suicide.  <br />Prior to reading Whittlesey's book I'd established a mental picture of  Yellowstone as a place that's dangerous because of bears.  Bears are  dangerous, of course, and must be respected, but there are lots of things  in the park that are far more likely to get you killed than bears.  Some of  the most likely ways to die are from drowning, falling, or boiling to  death. <br />It's true that some of the book's material can be tedious -  especially when it consists of lists of fatalities and related statistics.   However, much of it consists of some pretty interesting stories in which  Whittlesey does a respectable job of bringing together a human-interest  narrative that treats the tragic end of the story - which almost always  ends in human death - with a remarkable mixture of interest, dignity, and  respect. I found him compassionate in the telling of particularly tragic  accounts of death, and rather blunt about those that might have been a  candidate for the Charles Darwin award.     In spite of the subject matter,  this is not a book filled with sensationalism.  Neither is it a book that  glosses over the gruesome facts of death.  Rather, it is a book that  accurately portrays the dangers within the park and the unforgiving  consequences of ignoring those dangers.  Sprinkled throughout the text are  reminders that wilderness is dangerous, but to make it benign would be to  destroy one of its essential characteristics.  Yellowstone cannot, and  should not, be made perfectly safe.  Rather, those who visit it must  respect it for what it is.<br />Overall, this is a nice book, and it was just  the ticket for a relaxing evening in the camper at the day's end.  The kids  loved it - they were so engrossed - and I frequently found myself in a war  of wits trying to keep it hid and available for my reading pleasure.  The  pages are dog-eared, covered with dirt, and folded back.  The spine is  broken.  It's one well-read book and appreciated by many people.  I'm sure  you will find the same enjoyment.  If you are going to Yellowstone, you  really must pick up this book and read it first.  It literally could save  your life - and it's not bad reading to boot.	2000-08-25

Prasad and S. S. Iyengar, &quot;Joint<br />Time-Frequency Analysis,&quot; by Shie Qian and Dapang Chen,&quot;A<br />Friendly Guide to Wavelets,&quot; by Gerald Kaiser, and &quot;Wavelets:<br />an Analysis Tool,&quot; by M. Holschneider.  While these are good<br />&quot;introductory&quot; books for people already deeply familiar with<br />orthogonal bases and mathematics in general, I think they are<br />inadequate for someone wanting a truly fresh introduction to the<br />subject.<br />Hubbard's book, though, was just what I'd been looking for.<br />My wife bought it for me after dinner and a movie as we were browsing<br />the local bookstore in celebration of my 45th birthday.  Hubbard wrote<br />her book with the idea in mind that it is possible to describe<br />accurately and in principle many mathematical concepts that are often<br />made incomprehensible, or nearly so, through technical jargon.  The<br />technical jargon is necessary, of course, among professional<br />mathematicians, but it need not, and should not, get in the way of<br />conveying the basic ideas and concepts in an introductory text.  As a<br />science writer, Hubbard has done a masterful job of doing just that.<br />This book gives me the intuitive, spatial understanding of wavelets<br />that I just could not find in the other books I listed above.  It<br />helps form the basis for understanding the more detailed books, and it<br />also provides some interesting historical information.<br />The book is<br />divided into two parts.  Part 1, called &quot;The World According to<br />Wavelets,&quot; is essentially devoid of any mathematical formulas.<br />Instead of using mathematical symbols it uses imagery and verbal<br />explanation.  This is likely to be somewhat frustrating for those who<br />have a mathematical background.  Indeed, there were times when I found<br />myself trying to figure out which of several possibilities Hubbard was<br />talking about.  Mostly, part one introduces the reader to the idea of<br />separating a signal into its Fourier components, and then it extends<br />this basic idea - that signals can be expressed in different<br />&quot;languages&quot; to the notion of the wavelet.<br />Sprinkled<br />throughout part 1 are references to part 2, which is titled<br />&quot;Beyond Plain English.&quot; Unlike Part 1, Part 2 is full of<br />mathematical equations and terminology (though not at the same level<br />as the other books I mentioned above).  The level of mathematics is<br />mostly limited to what you'd expect to find in an undergraduate class<br />in physics or mathematics.<br />Even with the mathematical detail,<br />Hubbard presents Part 2 with the same sensitivity toward the<br />explanation of new ideas as she uses in Part 1.  The first chapter in<br />part 2 reviews the Fourier series and the Fourier transform.  This<br />chapter is less than ten pages long, but it's one of the best short<br />summaries I've seen.  It does not skimp on the mathematical details<br />but it's clear and understandable to a fault.<br />Chapter 2 talks about<br />the convergence of the Fourier series and has some nice (you've seen<br />them before, I suspect) illustrations showing how the Fourier series<br />of a train of square pulses converges.  There is some interesting<br />explanation of the Gibb's effect, as well as an interesting section on<br />stability of the solar system.  Hubbard does a nice job of explaining<br />how Fourier methods can be applied to studies of the stability of the<br />solar system, and how uncertainty arises from small divisors.<br />I<br />have another book in my personal library by E. Oran Brigham called the<br />&quot;Fast Fourier Transform.&quot; This is another great book, with<br />very good background material (succinct) on theFourier series and<br />transform.  However, I found Brigham's explanation of the FFT harder<br />to follow than the one Hubbard gives in chapter 3 of Part 2.  Granted,<br />Brigham's explanation goes into more detail (part of what makes it<br />harder to follow) but Hubbard, as she does throughout the book, does a<br />better job of illustrating the problem from the 50,000-foot<br />level.<br />Chapter 5 introduces the continuous wavelet transform in<br />integral form.  Chapter 6 returns to ideas developed qualitatively in<br />Part 1 about orthogonal bases.  Hubbard does a nice job of explaining<br />orthogonality by extension of the dot product between two-dimensional<br />vectors.  She also has a short description of non-orthogonal<br />bases.<br />Chapter 7 is pivotal, and describes multiresolution.  Hubbard<br />shows how the Haar function (a simple, orthogonal wavelet) and its<br />scaling function can be derived by using Fourier analysis and low-and<br />high-pass filters.  This was the chapter that I'd been looking for<br />when I bought the book - a simple (but not stupid) explanation of what<br />and how a wavelet is/works, written for an engineer who might want,<br />some day, to actually use them to do something useful.<br />Chapter 8 is<br />an explanation of the fast wavelet transform and is written in the<br />same understandable manner (and same high-level position) as the<br />chapter on the FFT.  Following it are several small chapters on<br />wavelets in two dimensions, pyramid algorithms, and<br />multiwavelets.<br />Chapter 12 is short (like most of the chapters) but<br />has one of the nicest explanations of the Heisenberg uncertainty<br />principle I've ever seen.  This is accompanied later in the book with<br />a nice proof in the appendix.  Chapter 13 helps tie it all together<br />with discussions about probability, the Heisenberg uncertainty<br />principle, and quantum mechanics.<br />The appendixes in this book are<br />especially useful and there is a nice list of wavelet software and<br />electronic resources at the end...	2000-08-16
US	53038410	R1LCN1MSMBZBJ4	0120451425	734711068	Nonlinear Fiber Optics, Second Edition (Optics and Photonics)	Books	5	19	19	N	N	A quantitative text on nonlinear fiber optics	This is a serious book written at a graduate-student or  advanced-under-graduate level for the practicing professional employed in  designing optical telecommunications systems and components. I don't think  the book was written with students particularly in mind, since (for  example) there are no examples or problems in the book as typically found  in university course work  In his introduction, Agrawal says &quot;[t]he  book is aimed for researchers already engaged in or wishing to enter the  filed of nonlinear fiber optics.&quot;   As the title suggests, the book's  emphasis is on nonlinear effects in optical fibers, as opposed to nonlinear  effects in bulk materials.  <br />The first chapter is pretty basic, and is  mostly review material that describes things like the index cross section  in an optical fiber, material issues, fabrication, chromatic dispersion,  modal birefringence (which leads to polarization mode dispersion), non  linear refraction and stimulated inelastic scattering.  The review here is  pretty brief (the chapter has only about 25 pages).<br />Chapter two develops  the mathematics of wave propagation in optical fibers, including the  mathematics of mode propagation and basic propagation equations derived  from Maxwell's equations.    This chapter actually develops several  different differential equations; each based on various assumptions  applicable to different pulse widths.  These differential equations then  form the basis for later investigations into various non-linear effects  discussed in the book.  Chapter two is thus a foundational chapter and  should be read and understood completely before moving on.  There is a  brief discussion at the end of the chapter that describes numerical  methods.<br />Chapter three describes group-velocity dispersion, including  chromatic dispersion as well as dispersion-induced pulse broadening and  higher-order dispersion and their implications for optical systems.   <br />Chapter four introduces self-phase modulation and self steepening.   <br />Chapter five describes optical solitons (including fundamental and  higher order solitions), soliton lasers, and soliton-based communications  systems.  <br />Chapter 6 describes some techniques for optical pulse  compression using gratings and chirped optical pulses.  It also describes  soliton-effect compressors.<br />Chapter 7 is devoted to the subject of  cross-phase modulation, chapter 8 to stimulated Raman scattering, chapter 9  to stimulated Brillouin scattering, and chapter 10 to parametric processes,  including four-wave mixing, parametric gain, and phase matching.<br />The book  is quantitative, making (as you'd expect in a graduate text) liberal use of  mathematics.  The level of mathematics, however, should be well within the  grasp of senior college students majoring in physics, engineering, or  mathematics.   The subject, however, is non-trivial, and you should expect  this book to present a real intellectual challenge in reading and  understanding all the details. I took about six months to finish the book,  including time taken to fill in some details in the derivations and to plot  some of the equations on my computer.<br />Agrawal makes good use of figures  and illustrations, which I found particularly helpful.  The book also has  an adequate index that makes the book more valuable as a desk reference.  <br />Each chapter cites a wealth of reference material in the literature so  that any subject covered within its pages can be studied in more detail and  from the original sources.<br />I would not make this a first study of  nonlinear optics (although it was for me).  Rather, I'd look for texts that  discuss nonlinear effects qualitatively, and I'd try to expose myself to  experiments that illustrate these nonlinear effects to gain a more  qualitative understanding before diving into Agrawal's mathematical  derivations.  With a more qualitative basis first acquired, however,  Agrawal's book is an invaluable tool for understanding the most obscure  nonlinear effects in optical fibers.	2000-08-14
US	53038410	RLY7ZYPUY17U6	0395938880	122125989	Absolute Zero: And the Conquest of Cold	Books	4	21	25	N	N	A history book	One of the promotional statements on the book's jacket describes it as being similar to David Sobel's book &quot;Longitude.&quot;  I agree.  There are some distinct similarities, and I think that if you liked  &quot;Longitude,&quot; you will probably enjoy &quot;Absolute Zero&quot;  every bit as much.<br />Though this is a good book it's not quite what I was  looking for.  The book is strictly a history book, while I was looking for  something that would have emphasized the scientific aspects more than  Shachtman does. For example, the book describes the work by scientists to  get as close as possible to absolute zero, but it never gives an adequate  definition of what absolute zero really is.  While it would have taken some  mathematics and a little physics, a better description of the physics would  have added considerably to this book.  [For a good discussion of the  physics - still at an introductory level - I suggest &quot;Temperatures  Very Low and Very High,&quot; by Mark W. Zemansky.  This book, published by  Dover, has only 127 pages.  So the price is right, and it makes a nice  companion volume (read it first) to Shachtman's book.]<br />Another thing that  bothered me about this book is that it has no figures or illustrations.   That's a big problem for a book that is constantly trying to describe this  or that configuration of scientific equipment.  There are at least a dozen  places in the text where I found myself reading it and then reading it over  again, trying to understand some convoluted description of apparatus when a  simple diagram would have taken care of the problem.<br />A third problem I  have with this book is the author's occasional lapse in describing  scientific principles.  For example, he describes quantum-mechanical  tunneling as a process &quot;in which the particles do not overcome the  energy of the atoms in their way but instead find a route between the atoms  in the wall.&quot; [p. 227]  This is a very misleading description ofquantum-mechanical tunneling.  In another place he describes the speeds of  particles in a particle accelerator: &quot;physicists had relied for  investigation of these latter particles on linear accelerators that raised  the particles' speed to several thousand miles per hour and let them smash  into obstacles, or each other, and disintegrate into interesting  pieces.&quot; [p. 231]  This statement has the particles in an accelerator  traveling about the same speed as an SR-71 jet.  In reality, particle  accelerators move atomic particles at nearly the speed of light, or  virtually 186,000 miles per second.<br />So my greatest objection to the book  is that it was written by an historian and not a scientist. <br />But don't  infer from my comments that I think this is a bad book.  I really did like  it, and found it engaging and difficult to put down.  One of the best  aspects of this book is the way it illustrates the conflict and competition  between scientists.  Sometimes there is a tendency to have an antiseptic  view of science, in which noble individuals, in white coats, struggle  against ignorance for the betterment of society.  Not so.  In reality there  were intense rivalries and bitter feuds, and these are laid out bare in the  human struggle that Shachtman describes in his story of the conquest of  cold.<br />The book not only describes the historical progress among  scientists, but also describes the influence that the technology of  generating cold temperatures had on more practical aspects of society.   There is some very interesting historical information about the natural-ice  industry that existed prior to development of modern-day refrigeration, and  how the ice was cut up at the end of the winter and put into storage, and  then shipped to regions around the world.  <br />There are also stories about  how the invention of modern refrigeration facilitated settling in the  southern portions of the United States.  Mostly, though, the stories focuson the scientists who spent their lives and sometimes livelihoods trying to  get closer and closer to absolute zero.  <br />The book is pretty up to date,  and includes historical developments around the invention of  high-temperature super conductors (high temperature, in this case, being  over 77 K, which is the temperature at which nitrogen liquefies).  There is  also some history around the verification of the Bose-Einstein condensate  at 170 billions of a degree K.  <br />Overall I think this is a fine book.  It  was certainly captivating, well written, and enjoyable.	2000-07-11
US	53038410	R2UZWCA3YBQNZ3	0679742441	138945486	How We Die: Reflections of Life's Final Chapter, New Edition	Books	5	645	655	N	N	Death comes to all; it's how you live that matters.	Humans are probably the only animals capable of understanding their mortality and envisioning the day of their death.  Sherwin B. Nuland shows, however, that while we conceptualize our eventual demise, most people have  unrealistic expectations of their death.  Misconceptions abound.  The  expectation of a noble death with loved ones gathered, final farewells, and  then eternal slumber forms a common though inaccurate mental image of what  many people look forward to in their final moments.<br />There are several  themes that permeate Nuland's books.  One theme is that death, like birth,  is a messy process.  Though we may wish for the noble death, more likely we  will die slowly from a lack of oxygen in the brain.  This, in turn, will  result from a failing heart, lungs, or blood vessels.  Death does not come  easy, and although the final moment is sometime serene and tranquil, months  or weeks of painful physical degeneration often precedes it. <br />The second  theme in Nuland's book is that death is not only inevitable, it is  necessary.  While life should be fought for as long as possible, we should  all realize that ultimately the battle will be lost.  We will die.  Nuland  takes a dim view of heroic attempts to extend life beyond the point where  the body has simply failed and death becomes not only inevitable, but also  the proper way for nature to renew herself.  Nature uses death to clear the  way for new generations, and just as we cannot experience the green buds of  spring unless the leaves from last season fall to the ground, the very  nature of life demands that when death becomes inevitable we exit the stage  for the next generation.<br />Nuland's third point is that the measure of a  life is not found so much in how we die, but in how we live and how we are  remembered.  Few of us can control the way in which we die.  For some of us  it will be quick, for others death will linger and the process will be slow  and painful.  Some will find humiliationin the loss of bodily functions or  mental facilities.  However it comes to anyone of us, death is just a part  of our lives and the real meaning in death is in the life  remembered.<br />Chapters 1 and 2 focus on the heart, how and why it fails,  and what are the consequences in terms of how death is precipitated.  These  chapters include some personal stories, but are mostly factual in nature.   They make fascinating reading for anyone interested in how the body works,  as well as those interested in death itself.<br />Chapter 3 is one of the most  poignant and describes the author's personal experiences in the life and  death of his Grandmother who raised him after his parents died when he was  eleven.  Nuland is a medical doctor, and he describes the deaths of many  people in his book, including the death of his Grandmother and his brother.   All these descriptions are stark.  There is no attempt to cover up the  messiness of death, yet the stories are told with such deep compassion and  understanding of the human condition and suffering that they bring a deep  upwelling in the soul.<br />Chapter 4 basically outlines Nuland's view that  &quot;Among living creatures, to die and leave the stage is the way of  nature - old age is the preparation for departure, the gradual easing out  of life that makes its ending more palatable not only for the elderly but  for those also to whom they leave the world in trust.&quot;<br />Chapter 5  describes Alzheimer's disease, and is one of the most interesting chapters  in the book.  This book includes some of the history of Alzheimer's  disease, how the disease manifests itself, and how it kills.  Like many  other topics in his book, Nuland illustrates the subject by describing the  process of degeneration and death due to this disease through his personal  experiences with individuals he knew.  <br />The sixth chapter, titled  &quot;Murder and Scerenity,&quot; was difficult for me.  It contains a  vivid description of the death of a little girl by a knife-wielding maniac.   The subject of the chapter is how the body produces chemicals that place  it in a type of trance when under tremendous stress.  The story of little  Katie is very poignant.  I hardly ever cry, but I did as I read of the way  she died.  Interestingly, though, I think that understanding the physiology  described in this chapter can be a source of solace even for those who have  lost loved ones through violent tragedy.<br />Chapter 7 discusses suicide and  euthanasia.  Nuland seems to take a dim view of suicide as promoted by some  organizations, but he seems to hold open the possibility of doctors taking  a more active roll in the final moments of death as patients ask for help  in the process.  This chapter brought some personal reflection to me, since  I'm from Oregon.  I voted with the majority of my fellow citizens to allow  doctors to help their patients end their suffering (Oregon's law has  abundant safeguards and cannot result in euthanasia or death for monetary  relief).   Ultimately, though, our voices could be rejected.   Interestingly, Gordon Smith, a Senator from Oregon, has proven fundamental  in overriding the Oregon voters on this issue. <br />Chapters 8 and 9 review  the story of aids and how that disease kills it victims, while chapters 10  and 11 describe death by cancer.  Chapter 12 summarizes, and leaves the  reader contemplating the fact that it's all but certain we will each die by  one or more of the processes described in Nuland's book.  How we die, and  how we will be remembered, however, are entirely up to each of us as  individuals	2000-07-11
US	53038410	R2F3PZ1R6UVCY9	1560851171	511838839	The Lord's University: Freedom and Authority at Byu	Books	5	34	45	N	N	I couldn't put it down	Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS, or Mormons) sustain their prophets as the literal representatives of God on earth.   Since the board of trustees for Brigham Young University (BYU) is  composed of the First Presidency of the LDS Church and the Quorum of Twelve  Apostles, it follows as a natural corollary for many Mormons that BYU, is  literally the Lord's university.  Thus the title for the book, and the  strange story of the suppression of academic freedom in an institution  supposedly directed by men who speak personally with the premier  intelligence of the universe. <br />The authors wrote the book largely from  personal experience and are sometimes characters in the story they tell.    As a younger man Waterman wrote for the &quot;Student Review,&quot; a  banned independent newspaper that catered to BYU's more independent minds.   Kagel wrote for BYU's official &quot;Daily Universe.&quot;  Their book is  of the highest quality in its presentation and research, and the  documentation is simply amazing, all the more so since they were denied  &quot;access to accounts from administrators and board members.&quot;  <br />The book is divided into two parts.  Part one is background information  for those not familiar with Mormonism, and helps to present the context in  which later controversies developed.  Chapter 1 describes Mormonism's  historical development of schools and seminaries, not so much out of  commitment to the truth, but from a practical need to forge a civilization  in the wilderness and to maintain control over members.  <br />Chapter 2 is a  history of Feminism at BYU.  I found this chapter particularly interesting  because I still remember the massive political opposition the LDS Church  mounted against the equal rights amendment and title IV.  I recall the  fiery speeches warning of the evils of women working outside the home,  using birth control, etc.  Waterman and Kagel describe these teachings of  the LDS Churchin historical context to bring greater understanding to the  environment in which BYU later terminated feminist professors and how  teachings of the LDS Church promote gender-based discrimination in the work  place.<br />Chapter 3 is a brief history of BYU's student newspaper, and how  the administration has gradually forced its way into the position of  censor.  A key theme throughout the book is the Church's heavy-handed  aversion to any form of criticism.  <br />Chapter 4 describes the evolution of  BYU's honor code.  Begun as a true student honor code, it was quickly  appropriated by the administration and morphed into a tool for controlling  unwanted behavior and thoughts.  Today the honor code consists mostly of a  dress code and prohibitions against doing anything that would embarrass the  LDS Church.  There are some interesting stories here, like the BYU coed who  was refused admission to the testing center during finals because she was  wearing jeans (a violation of the honor code at the time).  It was winter  and she was wearing a long coat, so she went to bathroom, removed her  pants, buttoned up her coat, and was promptly admitted to the testing  area.<br />Part two describes specific controversies in greater detail.   Chapter 5 discusses BYU's statement on academic freedom and their policy of  discouraging teachers from participating in certain symposia.    For  example, &quot;[f]ollowing the 1992 Sunstone Symposium, Scott Abbott was  warned by his stake president, BYU religion professor Keith Perkins, that  his analysis of BYU and academic freedom showed 'potential for  apostasy.&quot; [p. 264].  Perkins was told to apologize to Mormon apostle  Packer for the sin of critiquing the Mormon leader's ideas.<br />Chapter 6  describes the firing of Cecilia Konchar Farr and David Knowlton.  It's  fascinating to read of the unethical behavior of BYU's administration as  they fabricated their case against these teachers and forced them out of  the university.The book is a tribute to those individuals who's  professional reputations were tarnish by an administration that lied about  their worth as intellectuals in their headlong rush to purge the university  of teachers who did not follow the administration's party line on how to  think, and what to say.<br />Chapter 7 touches slightly on a covert committee  that spies on church members and keeps tabs of their public statements  regarding the church.  It also describes briefly the excommunication of  historian Michael Quinn and others for uncovering and publishing  information to which the General Authorities objected.  In other parts of  the book they describe the firing of David P. Write, an assistant professor  of Near Easter studies, for privately admitting that the Book of Mormon is  not literal history.  Steve Epperson was fired for spending time on Sunday  supporting a non-profit music conservatory for children instead of going to  his Church meetings.   Chapter 8 describes the firing of Gail Turley  Houston and Brian Evenson.  Brian is the son of William Evenson, a  professor of Physics from whom I took theoretical mechanics while at BYU.  <br />The book ends by documenting the influence of right-wing organizations  on the thinking and behavior of BYU's administration and the leadership of  the LDS Church.  I was unaware of how deep some of the connections go.   After reading this chapter much of the propaganda to which I was exposed  growing up in the LDS Church made a lot more sense.  It was particularly  interesting to see these influences in Dallin Oaks, who was BYU's president  when I attended.  [Oaks, who is now a member of the Quorum of Twelve  Apostles, was in my ward during the first summer semester after I got  married.  On one occasion I had the chance to introduce myself to him after  a Sunday-school class we attended.  These experiences make accounts of his  behavior even more intriguing.]  <br />One of the book's unstated values is  the insight itgives into the behind-the-scenes behavior of what it means  to be a Mormon.  If you want to understand Mormonism by observing Mormon  behavior, then this book should be an integral part of your study program.	2000-07-11
US	53038410	R16GUKLAJ71NP1	0521667801	733882627	The Strange World of Quantum Mechanics	Books	5	63	64	N	N	A no-nonsense, qualitative primer	Imagine being raised all your life in an environment without gravity and then suddenly finding yourself on a planet with a strong gravitational field.  Things would be really strange.  Your intuition would be confused  and confounded.  Take the simple act of tossing a ball, for example.  Your  intuition tells you that the ball will go straight, but in this strange  world the ball curves.  To toss the ball to someone you must toss it up, so  that it arcs over.  Otherwise, if you toss it straight (like your intuition  tells you to) it curves downward and hits the ground.<br />Strangeness,  obviously, depends on our sense of intuition, and our sense of intuition  depends upon the rules of engagement in the world in which we live.  Most  of us live in a world dominated by classical physics where objects have a  definite position, velocity, mass, energy, etc.  It is because of our  intimate personal experience with this classical world that non-classical  environments like the very fast and the very tiny seem counter intuitive.   <br />Styer's book aims to help the reader understand the experiences of the  quantum world.  Though real quantum intuition cannot come from a book,  Styer helps the reader gain a measure of intuition regarding what happens  at the quantum level.  Styer's book is one of the best I've seen for  explaining quantum mechanics in a rigorously qualitative manner that's  understandable by virtually anyone with the intellectual discipline to  learn new ideas.  [The other book I recommend in this area, and from which  Styer uses as a frequent reference, is &quot;QED, The Strange Theory of  Light and Matter,&quot; by Richard Feynman.  For someone just starting out  in his or her study of quantum mechanics, I recommend Feynman's book  followed by Styer's.  Both are qualitative and have little mathematics.   For an introduction to the mathematics of quantum mechanics (using  mathematics at the freshman college level) I suggest Sam Treiman's  &quot;The Odd Quantum.&quot;  These three books form an excellent basis for  a course in study that tackles quantum physics at the quantitative  level.]<br />The book has 15 chapters, but is only 150 pages long, so each  chapter is rather short.  The chapters are organized nicely, however, and  each has a specific goal for the reader, with good illustrations throughout  and thought-provoking questions at the end (numeric answers are in the back  of the book, though many questions do not have a numeric answer).  Unlike  the questions found in some textbooks, Styer's questions are formulated  specifically to build insight into the main issues presented in the  chapters, and to extend upon them.  I strongly suggest answering each  question in detail, as it will greatly enrich the experience of reading  this book.<br />Styer is a master at explaining the central concepts of  quantum mechanics in an intuitive and visual manner (his style of  presentation is similar to Feynman's).  Unlike many other authors, Styer  does not introduce quantum mechanics by using the double-slit experiment.   Instead, Styer bases almost all his arguments on an idealized (portable and  configurable) Stern-Gerlach analyzer, which measures the magnetic spin of  quantum particles (he later uses a modified form to introduce quantum  interference).  Styer does all this, and masterfully, by using  non-technical language that nevertheless maintains the integrity of the  ideas embodied in quantum mechanics.  <br />A brief introduction, some stuff  on how classical magnetic needles behave in a magnetic field, a description  of the Stern-Gerlach experiment, and the &quot;conundrum of  projections,&quot; or the quantization of quantum spin, take up the first  four chapters.  Chapter 5 is a primer on simple concepts in statistics and  lays the groundwork for later chapters.  Chapters 6 and 7 deal with the  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments, which I found to be among the simplest  and most illuminating that I've foundin an introductory text.  Typical of  Styer's book throughout, he shows that the &quot;paradox&quot; arises from  false assumptions in which we try to project our intuition from the  classical world into the quantum world. <br />Styer describes the double-slit  experiment, but he saves it till chapters 8 and 9 and explains it not just  in terms of photons but also in terms of atoms as well.  The discussion of  quantal interference leads naturally to a further expansion of the concept  of amplitudes and probability in quantum mechanics.  The book ends with a  chapter on quantum cryptography, a chapter on the quantum-mechanical  behavior of a quantum ball, and a chapter that has a brief introduction of  wavefunction.<br />There are also three excellent apprentices (these should be  read with the same commitment as reading all the chapters in the book) and  an adequate index.  Styer also has a very nice list of other reading  material on quantum mechanics, as well as some biting editorial statements  about errors in popular books on the subject.  Styer's approach is no  nonsense.  Rather than waxing philosophical about the dual particle-wave  nature of matter, Styer correctly helps the reader realize that to  understand quantum mechanics we must do so by understanding the behavior of  quanta and not try to force our classical perceptions.  As Styer says:  &quot;In fact an atom is no more a small hard marble [or a classical wave]  than an atom's magnetic needle is a pointy stick.  These classical ideas  are simply wrong when applied to very small objects.&quot;<br />Very well  written in an engaging, no-nonsense style that cuts straight to the heart  of the issue, this is simply one of the best introductory (qualitative and  without mathematics) books I've read on the subject.  Whether you are  reading about quantum mechanics for the very first time, or simply trying  to increase your intuitive feel for the subject, I highly recommend it.	2000-07-11

This is one of the most delightful books I've read in a long time.  I have one other book by Banks, &quot;Towing Icebergs, Falling Dominoes, and other adventures in applied mathematics.&quot;  Like &quot;Towing Icebergs,&quot;  &quot;Slicing Pizzas&quot; is jam packed with sometimes useful, sometimes  trivial, but always entertaining mathematical excursions into some of the  most interesting little &quot;didja know?&quot; subjects in applied  mathematics.  If you have inquisitive kids - or if you are one yourself --  it's a definite must read.<br />The book is a little over 250 pages long, and  there are 26 chapters, so each chapter is pretty brief - typically only  about ten pages.   Most of the mathematics in the book is algebra,  trigonometry, geometry, and a little bit of calculus, and the book is  literally packed with mathematical equations and diagrams.  Just because  most of the mathematics is at the high-school level, however, does not mean  that it's necessarily easy or trivial.  When it comes to &quot;mess'n with  math&quot; Banks is a real pro, and I found myself on more than one  occasion taking up to 30 minutes filling in the details from one of his  equations to the next. <br />What's fun about Bank's book is that it goes  after problems you might not have thought about.  And when Banks starts  going into detail it can really make your head spin.  Take, for example,  the American flag.  How much could you write about the mathematical  description of the flag?  Well, Banks packs more information than you might  suspect into 22 pages (chapter 1 and lots of chapter 2).  It seems that  just about everything you can say about the flag (mathematically speaking)  and about five-pointed stars and golden ratios is tied up in this chapter.   Ever wonder what percentage of the flag is blue, white, and red?  Banks  will tell you. <br />Caroline particularly got a kick out of chapter 3.  She  is 10 years old and loves pizza, so when Banks decided to write a chapter  on how to cut a pizza to get the most number of pieces for a given number  of cuts she could relate.  Think it's easy?  Try working the problem and  then compare your answer with Banks.  When you are done, do it for  watermelons (that is, do it in three dimensions).  <br />Have you ever  wondered what is the best strategy in getting from one point to the next  through a rainstorm?  Is it best to run fast and minimize the amount of  water on your head whilst soaking your front and splashing your feet and  legs?  Or, should your run a little slower, get a little wetter on top, but  keep your legs and shoes a little less damp?  This is yet another example  of the seemingly whimsical yet eminently practical and always mathematical  problems that Banks entertains us with (chapter 4).<br />Then there are those  tidbits for spouting out around the dinner table during awkward times when  everyone stops talking.  &quot;Hey, guess how many times the oxygen in the  world's atmosphere has been breathed by people&quot; Or &quot;Hey, guess  how many times the water in the world has been drunk by people&quot;    <br />Now here is an interesting idea.  Because the earth spins on its axis it  is an oblate ellipsoid, which means that its diameter is greater at the  equator than at the poles.  Banks asks the question, &quot;which rivers run  up hill.&quot;  That is, which rivers have their mouth further away from  the earth's center than their heads?  Think it isn't possible?  Think again  and then read chapter 6.<br />Many of the problems that Banks solves deal with  spherical geometry and trigonometry.  For example, how would you go about  calculating the length of the seam on a baseball or tennis ball?  Banks  does it in chapter 24 in what is probably the most mathematically intense  chapter.  It's not as easy as you might think.<br />Chapter 9 is about great  number sequences, and Banks finds a practical application in - among all  things - the problem of how the captain of a destroyer would go about  tracking down an enemy submarine.  Who would have thought there was a  connection?  There are too many examples to mention them all, but rounding  out my favorites are chapters on how to make a valentine, how to pursue  prey, how many people have ever lived on earth, population explosions, and  (my very favorite) what makes a rainbow.  <br />This book is very much in the  same flavor as Bank's other book,  &quot;Towing Icebergs.&quot;  It also  has much of the same flavor as James R. Newman's four-volume set &quot;The  World of Mathematics.&quot;  If you are acquainted with any of those books,  and found them interesting, I think you will like this one.<br />One of the  things I like best about this book is the frequent use of homework  assignments.  In lots of cases Banks takes the reader through to the bitter  end, but in others he leaves tantalizing tidbits for the really  enthusiastic readers (though he often provides answers - something welcome,  in my opinion).  The only real complaint I have about the book is it's  utterly useless index.  This is such a fun book, and covers so much  material that it's real shame you cannot go look up many of the topics it  discusses by using the index.  For example, some of the most interesting  information in the book deals with the golden number and golden ratio, yet  neither &quot;golden number,&quot; or &quot;golden ratio&quot; is in the  index.  I read the book with a pen and marker, so I updated the index in  several cases. <br />If you love mathematics and doing mental calethsentics I  think you will really enjoy this book.	2000-06-05

You might think that photographing snow crystals is no different than photographing other inanimate objects,  but it's not true.

US	53038410	R3P9COQWKQK96D	0691058776	628933888	What Science Is and How It Works	Books	4	19	22	N	N	A pretty good book.	If I could summarize my opinion of this book in a single word it would be &quot;ambivalence.&quot;  The book definitely has its good points, but it lacks closure on many themes, is open ended in many ways, and it's a little  of order.  Perhaps Derry wanted it that way because scientific progress  often goes the same route.  This is supposed to be an explanatory text,  though, and I would have organized it differently.<br />The book begins with a  chapter consisting of several stories from the history of science,  including the discovery of the structure of Benzene and the development the  Smallpox vaccine.  There are five in all, and each illustrates a different  application of the method of science to discovery.  The one thing lacking  from this chapter (and from the book, for that matter) is a cohesive  summary of the principles brought out through these examples.  I think  Derry wanted his readers to figure it out themselves, and so he shuns  summary tables and lists as a way of making the reader think.  Part of the  author's message is that science does not work according to a given set of  rules -- the kind of rules you might have learned in grade school. Instead,  Derry presents science as a more fluid construct.  I agree, but telling the  stories had a point, and I believe he should have been more succinct in  bringing out his opinion about what the point was suppose to be, especially  in relationship to the stories meant to illustrate how science works.   <br />The next few chapters list some important methods used by scientists --  some of which are illustrated in the examples from chapter 1.  For example,  chapter two describes how looking for patterns in nature provides important  clues in scientific exploration.  Chapter three describes the importance of  instrumentation in scientific work, primarily in allowing scientists to  observe phenomena in which they would be otherwise unaware.  Chapter four  explains how sometimes small discrepancies between observation and  theoretical prediction often leads to the abandonment of old theories and  the development of new ones.<br />Chapter five is a condensed history of  astronomy, from the early Greeks through Galileo and Newton (the book uses  examples from many branches of science, but mostly from physics, Derry's  field of expertise).  This chapter brings together many of the unifying  concepts in science, but (again) they must be found and understood by the  reader -- the author does not deliver them point-by-point in list or table  format (even in summary).  <br />Chapter six begins the second part of the  book (there are four) by describing models, modeling, and approximations.   This chapter is definitely long on &quot;how science works&quot; and short  on &quot;what science is.&quot;  Reading the chapter on models, for  example, might leave the reader with the impression that truth and reality  are almost irrelevant and that the objective of science is to simply  develop models that predict the outcome of experiments.  I agree that  models are important.  However, I think it's safe to say they are more  important in applied science and engineering than they are in pure science,  and that there is still some expectation by scientists that fundamental  scientific theories somehow give us a window into the way the universe  &quot;really is.&quot;<br />Chapter seven is among the best, and deals with  the way logic, reason, critical evaluation, and evidence are built into the  scientific method.  This chapter describes deductive and inductive logic,  the importance of documented (and repeatable) evidence, and evaluating  causality.  It also has some really good stuff on bogus arguments, giving  examples of half-a-dozen or more common techniques used by people to fool  themselves and/or mislead others.<br />There is also a chapter on science and  religion, as well as science and how it relates to society and ethics.   Both these chapters have little to do with the book's thesis (what science  is, and how it works).  The chapter on science and religion, in particular,  is brief and tends towards reasoning based on semantics.  <br />Another good  chapter (12) deals with pseudoscience and how to recognize it.  Derry  offers &quot;claims for perpetual motion&quot; and &quot;creation  science&quot; as examples of pseudoscience.  Unlike other examples in the  book, Derry shows exactly how and why these two inventions of human  imagination ought to be classified as pseudoscience, and how they are  fundamentally different from modern science.  Chapter 13 describes  boarder-land areas like cold fusion and parapsychology.  These, Derry  argues, qualify as science, but (especially in the case of cold fusion)  illustrate ways in which science can (and sometimes does) go awry.  <br />The  third part of the book ends with chapters 14 and 15, which deal with the  philosophy of science.  Here Derry actually explains the important parts of  theory formation, but only briefly.  Most of this chapter deals with things  of a pretty philosophical nature, such as questions about what causes  scientific revolutions and how we know things.  The nuts and bolts of  theory formation are in the chapters on modeling -- chapters that  unfortunately and amazingly virtually never mention the word  &quot;theory.&quot;<br />The last part seems almost like a separate book, and  consists of six chapters that supposedly describe unifying concepts.  While  I could certainly find unifying concepts in the examples, I'm not at all  sure that these are the best examples.  For example, one chapter describes  how volume grows faster than area, which grows faster than length, and how  this determines maximum sizes for some animals.  Another describes the  importance of symmetry in mathematics and in art.  Yet another describes  thermodynamics and the &quot;arrow of time.&quot;  Finishing off the list  are chapters on feedback loops, linear dependence, and exponential growth.<br />For me, this book started out slow, but ended up being reasonably  interesting.  Overall I don't think it's a great book on the nature of  science, but it's okay and certainly has its good points.	2000-05-22
US	53038410	R34ZG9LIX5BGJP	0486637603	130431527	Principles of Statistics (Dover Books on Mathematics)	Books	5	229	233	N	N	An excellent reference and self-study guide	I have six books on statistics in my personal library.  All of them are bigger than Bulmer's book, but none have been read as many times, and none are as tattered, marked up, and cross-referenced.  Simply put, Bulmer's book is the most useful and complete book on basic statistics that I have.   It's a nice package in a reasonably sized book with all the most important  stuff for dealing with basic statistical problems that many engineers are  likely to encounter in a day's work.<br />Chapter 1 is a short blurb on the  concept of probability.  This is very useful because it places the rest of  the text on a very specific and concise footing.  Essentially there are two  concepts of probability.  One is the relative frequency with which an event  occurs in the long run.  An example of this is the tossing of a coin many  times and counting the number of times it comes up heads.  The author  describes this as statistical probability.  <br />The second concept of  probability is what the author calls inductive probability.  Inductive  probability is &quot;the degree of belief which it is reasonable to place  on a proposition on given evidence.&quot;  The essential difference between  the two concepts of probability is that statistical probability is an  empirical concept, while &quot;inductive probability is a logical  concept.&quot;   Bulmer closes chapter 1 by saying, &quot;It has been  reluctantly concluded by most statisticians that inductive probability  cannot in general be measured and, therefore, cannot be ............&quot;  Read chapter 1 to find some  interesting arguments in support of this proposition - a proposition that  may be surprising to some people.  As a result (and as the book's title  suggests) Bulmer keeps his book almost exclusively in the domain of  statistical probability.<br />Chapter 2 introduces two simple law of  probability.  The first relates to the addition of probabilities of  mutually exclusive events.  The second relates to the multiplication of  probabilities.  Simple in concept, Bulmer illustrates these two laws by  several examples including tables of measurements made on real experiments,  and some from Mendel's laws of heredity.<br />Chapter 3 is pivotal.  It  develops the mathematical expressions for random variables and probability  distributions.   Chapter 3 is relatively short, but lays the groundwork for  chapter 4, which describes the properties of distributions.  Chapter 4 has  many useful equations, including those for the mean, variance, measures of  dispersion, moments, etc.<br />Chapter 5 introduces the notion of expected  values for both discrete and continuous variables.  These are determined  not only for single distributions, but also for distributions that are  combined in algebraic ways through multiplication, addition, division,  etc., which also leads (naturally enough) to the moment-generating  function.<br />Chapter 6 highlights some important distributions (the  Binomial, Poisson, and Exponential) and discusses their statistical  properties (mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis).  Bulmer adds  additional insight into these distributions by describing how they arise in  real-world situations.  [As a note here, this chapter is useful and  interesting, but it could easily be many pages longer.  For example, when I  was investigating polarization mode dispersion in optical fibers I wanted  to know the statistical properties of the Maxwellian distribution.  Bulmer  did not have it - and I eventually found what I was looking for in   &quot;The Handbook of Mathematical Functions,&quot; by Milton Abramowitz  and Irene A. Stegun.]<br />The normal distribution is not covered in chapter  6.  Instead, as the granddaddy of all statistical distributions, it gets  its own chapter - chapter 7.  Here Bulmer derives the moments, variance,  and a couple of proofs relating to the Gaussian or normal distribution.  He  also has a nice discussion on the central-limit theorem - which explains  why the normal distribution is found in so many places.  Chapter 8  continues the theme of distribution functions by considering the  Chi-squared, t, and F functions. <br />Chapter 9 leaves the subject of  distributions and describes tests of significance.  This is an extremely  important chapter for anyone involved in experimental science where the  uncertainty of experimental results must be understood and reported.   Chapter 10 deals with a related subject - namely statistical inference.  In  these two chapters Bulmer develops the tools and techniques needed to  properly interpret, understand, and report on statistical data - including  non-statistical data with statistical noise.<br />The book ends with a  discussion on regression and correlation.  Again, this is a very useful  chapter with equations for the slope and intercept for linear regression,  as well as variance for the slope and intercept.  Bulmer includes the  derivations for these equations, making it easy and straightforward to  extend the analysis to provide regression and correlation for any  polynomial fit.  This chapter - along with those on tests of significance  and statistical inference - will probably be the most useful to students in  the sciences.<br />The book ends with several tables.  Many of these tables  were generated before the age of calculators, so they may be less needed  today than in days gone by.  Still, you don't always have a calculator  handy.  The tables include the probability and density functions for the  standard normal distribution, the cumulative probability function for the  normal distribution, percentage points of the t distribution, Chi-squared  distribution, and the five-percent and one-percent points of the F  distribution.<br />The book has an adequate index (though I'd like it to be  longer) and each chapter has problems - with answers in the back.  This  makes the book ideal for individual study, and the problems often provide  greater insight by helpingthe student extend ideas found in the book.   <br />Overall, this is one of the most used books in my library.  And for the  price, it's an absolute steal.   If you've been wanting a short, concise,  yet relatively complete book on statistics - and one that is well-written  and easy to follow, yet mathematically involved - but still practical, I  highly suggest Bulmer's book.	2000-05-05

I bought it because I wanted a ready desk reference that would put all I needed to know about the Jones and Muller calculus, along with the Poincare sphere, in one source.  I also wanted a book that lists  the Jones and Muller matrices for all sorts of idealized and real-world  optical components.  This book has it all, and more.<br />Chapter one is a  quick review of the nature of light, with interesting historical  information and a quick blurb on spectroscopy and an interesting table  showing the types of atomic/nuclear transitions and the emission wavelength  associated with each.  This chapter is really just an extension of the  preface.<br />Chapter two introduces the basic concepts of polarization in an  electro-magnetic wave, including the equation of the electric field for  elliptically polarized light, with extra emphasis on the two extremes  (linear and circular polarization).  Chapter two includes some useful  pictorial examples of polarized light.  The authors have been careful to  define their terms well.  They also have a rather lengthy footnote in  chapter two that establishes their conventions for describing circularly  polarized light.  Also helpful is their inclusion of a list at the end of  each chapter containing the mathematical symbols used in the chapter and  their meanings.<br />Chapter three introduces common devices used to control  polarized light, including linear polarizers made of dichroic as well as  birefringent materials, and those constructed by such techniques as stacks  of tilted glass plates.  The chapter also introduces the concept of phase  plates used to construct retarders, and gives useful physical information  for materials commonly used in their construction.  Artifacts due to  retarders and polarizers are also discussed, along with a rather  superficial discussion about depolarizers.  The end of the chapter has a  neat discussion about Haidinger's brushes and how you can use them to  &quot;cure&quot; polarization blindness.<br />Chapter 4 is among the book's  most useful.  This chapter introduces the Jones Calculus, Mueller Calculus,  and the Poincare sphere.  This is the chapter in the book that I find  myself returning to most often, along with appendix A (Jones and Stokes  vectors of various forms of polarized light), and appendix B (Jones and  Mueller matrices for various polarizing or polarization-sensitive optical  components).  Chapter 4 and appendixes A and B alone are sufficient  justification for purchasing the book.  The appendices, for example, are  quite complete, listing matrices for everything from the general elliptical  polarizer to the general elliptical retarder (there are 19 entries for  Jones matrices alone).<br />The authors develop the Jones and Muller calculus  in a manner that's easy to follow yet both rigorous and insightful.  The  book makes no apologies about the use of mathematics, and uses equations  and derivations liberally.  The level of mathematics is easy, however,  being nothing more than linear algebra for the most part.  There are also  useful examples of how to use the Jones and Muller matrix methods to solve  simple problems.  The chapter introduces the Jones calculus first, then  the Muller calculus, and finishes off with a good discussion and  explanation of the Poincare sphere.<br />Chapter 5 covers the Jones and  Muller calculus again, this time with more mathematical involvement and in  greater detail.  Chapter 5 also describes the Poincare sphere in more  detail as well.  Chapter 4 aims more at the initial introduction and  relatively simple practical applications, while chapter 5 deals with such  subjects as the analytical relationship between the coordinates of the  Poincare sphere, the Stokes parameters, and the electric vector describing  the light.<br />The first 5 chapters constitute the book's coverage of the  general principles of polarization.The rest of the book deals with  applied issues relating to polarization.  For example, chapter 6 deals with  the physics of spectroscopy and polarized light, chapter 7 deals with  orientation and photoselection effects, and chapter 8 (the last chapter)  covers polarized light in condensed phases.<br />I bought the book because I  wanted a complete and authoritative reference for the general principles of  polarization.  I was especially looking for a text that succinctly yet  accurately and completely introduced the mathematical concepts of the Jones  and Muller calculus, and that provided a clear description of the Poincare  sphere.  Furthermore, I wanted a reference book that listed the transfer  matrices (both in the Jones and Muller calculus) for a wide assortment of  idealized and real-world optical components that interact with polarized  light.  The book has been everything I was looking for and is the best I've  found on the subject.<br />If you work with or have an interest in  polarized light and it's quantitative analysis, I highly recommend this  book.tion.

US	53038410	R13MM9F81O8BWR	0471292885	448903332	Linear Systems, Fourier Transforms, and Optics	Books	5	33	33	N	N	Well written and complete	I consider Gaskill's book to be the best I've seen for advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate classes on linear systems.  Gaskill approaches the subject in a clear and understandable style while dealing  with the subject in a complete and quantitative manner.  Though he does not  eschew mathematical rigor by any means, the text is well written and  logically formatted, making it refreshingly easy to follow what is, in  other texts, a more difficult subject.  Though I've filed Gaskill's book in  my library alongside other dealing with optics, this is primarily a book on  mathematics, but written more for engineers and scientists than for  mathematicians.  <br />After a brief introduction, the author begins (in  chapter 2) with a quick summary of mathematical concepts, including classes  of functions, one and two-dimensional functions, complex numbers, phasors,  and the scalar wave equation.<br />The third chapter introduces useful  functions (many of a discontinuous nature) that find application in  modeling linear systems.  These include step functions and the impulse  function in both one and two dimensions.  Development of these functions  follows an intuitive path that reflects the way in which they are often  used.  The many figures are particularly useful in conveying concepts more  effectively.<br />Chapter four develops the theme of harmonic analysis by  introducing the notion of orthogonal expansions and extending this  development to the Fourier series, leading to development of the Fourier  integral.   The chapter finishes with some worked examples showing the  spectra of simple functions.  Chapter 7 seems a little out of place, since  it deals with the Fourier transform, yet appears in the book several  chapters later, after the author introduces the concepts of linear systems  and the convolution.<br />Though one of the shorter chapters, chapter five is  pivotal, and develops the idea of mathematical operators and physical  systems - with the crucial development of the impulse response.  The  application of the impulse response is extended by chapter 6, which  develops the mathematics of convolution.  For a linear, shift-invariant  system the impulse response convolved with the input to the system gives  the system's output.  <br />Chapter 8 pulls together the material in the  previous chapters to mathematically describe the characteristics and  applications of linear filters.  Examples include amplitude filters, phase  filters, combination amplitude and phase filters, and some interesting  applications showing (for example) how to filter the noise from a signal of  interest.  All this development is strictly mathematical, with no  real-world worked examples (except in the abstract).  Nevertheless, this  chapter is very useful and (in the author's style) easy to understand and  follow.<br />Chapter 9 deals with two-dimensional convolutions and the  two-dimensional Fourier transform.  This chapter is essentially an  extension of the earlier one-dimensional developments in earlier chapters,  but introduces some useful mathematical tools, including the convolution  and Fourier transform in polar coordinates.  The Hankel transform,  developed in this chapter, is particularly useful for work in optics where  many examples (laser beams, for instance) exhibit circular symmetry.  In  these examples the two-dimensional integrals may be greatly simplified by  the Hankel transform to a one-dimensional form where (even in the absence  of a closed-form equation) they are far more tractable.  The chapter  concludes with useful tables of common transforms.<br />Chapter 10 leaves the  almost purely mathematical forum of the previous chapters by introducing  the subject of propagation and diffraction of optical waves.  Gaskill first  develops the mathematics of the optical waves and then derives the  equations that show how these waves are diffracted.  Not surprisingly, the  diffraction fields are expressible in terms of the transforms developed  earlier in the book.  The chapter also describes the influence of optical  lenses on the diffraction patterns and the very important subject of  propagation of Gaussian beams (since many laser beams, and the fundamental  mode in weakly guiding optical fibers have Gaussian profiles).<br />Chapter 11  continues the optical theme by explaining image-forming systems.  The  student will be particularly enabled in this chapter if he or she has had  prior exposure to the subject of diffraction and perhaps some exposure to  the idea of image aberrations.  The book ends with appendix 1, on special  functions, and appendix 2, on elementary geometric optics.  Each chapter  has a list of references, and problems for the student, and the book has a  complete index making it useful as a desk references book as well as a  textbook for advanced undergraduate and first-year graduate  coursework.<br />Gaskill's book is mathematically intense, but the author's  style and frequent use of figures makes the book surprisingly easy to read.   Prerequisites for this book should include a couple of years of calculus,  differential equations, and a smattering of linear algebra.  Some exposure  to concepts in optics, including diffraction and aberrations would also be  helpful.<br />Gaskill's book will be helpful far beyond optics, with  applications in electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, digital  image processing, or anywhere else that linear systems might be  encountered.	2000-04-28
US	53038410	R14ULGWX9EZJ0N	0123951712	209994920	Optical Fiber Telecommunications IIIB, Volume 3B (Optics and Photonics) (v. 3)	Books	5	20	21	N	N	A great two-volume set	This is the second book in a two-volume set.  Volume IIIA (608 pages) deals primarily with system-related issues.  The second volume, IIIB (515 pages) delves into greater detail regarding the design and performance of critical components used in optical fiber telecommunications. <br />Like  volume IIIA, volume IIIB consists of chapters written by different authors.   Although many of the chapter authors come from Lucent and/or Bell Labs,  they do a good job of keeping the book at an academic level that is largely  devoid of excess or offensive commercialism.  This is a first-rate book  that needs to be read and understood by anyone seriously engaged in  engineering activities related to optical fiber telecommunications.   <br />Each chapter is written in what is an essentially self-contained manner  (though many chapters make reference from time to time to other chapters in  either of the two volumes - a welcome thing as it brings continuity to the  two-volume set).  After a nice overview by Kaminow, volume IIIB dives right  into what is arguably the single most important optical component to be  developed for telecommunications in the 90's: the erbium-doped fiber  amplifier.  As with most chapters, chapter 2 does not overwhelm the reader  with long mathematical derivations.  Instead, it places at the engineer's  disposal the relevant mathematical equations necessary for important  analysis, as well as a wealth of references at the end of the chapter that  facilitate further reading and the most quantitative analysis.  This  chapter covers all the important features of amplifier design, from gain to  saturation, noise figure, coupling loss, polarization effects, pumping  schemes, components, and various ways in which the amplifier may be used  (in-line amplifier, power amplifier, etc.).<br />Chapter three covers  transmitter and receiver design for amplified lightwave systems.  The  material in this chapter is high level.  Topics include things like  extinction ratio, rise/fall time, chirp, mode partitioning, and  polarization mode dispersion.  The emphasis is on how specific attributes  of the transmitter and receiver interact with other components in the  transmission system to affect overall system performance.  Thus, the  chapter not only discusses what laser chirp is, what causes it, and how to  reduce it, it also delves into the system implications of chirp and  describes why it is bad, and how to determine how much you can tolerate.  <br />Chapters four, five, and six are something of a trilogy.  Chapter four  introduces the idea of laser sources in general for amplified and WDM  lightwave systems.  Chapter 5 continues the subject by describing advances  in semiconductor laser growth and fabrication technology.  Chapter 6 goes  into more specific detail regarding vertical-cavity surface-emitting  lasers.  Of these three chapters, chapter four is the most generic, and (at  least for me) by far the easiest to follow.    Chapter four covers subjects  like direct modulation of DFB lasers, external modulation, integration of  modulator and laser, making DFB lasers with discrete and stable wavelengths  for WDM systems, fiber-based lasers using fiber-Bragg gratings (FBGs),  tunable lasers, and a smattering on waveguide gratings and DFB array WDM  sources. <br />While chapter 4 was easy for me to follow, I found chapters 5  and 6 rather difficult.  Both these chapters are very well written, and the  authors are clearly quite expert in their fields.  The material, however,  is sufficiently specific to the details of design that I found myself  lacking much of the prerequisite information and knowledge expected by the  authors.   I think that chapters 5 and 6 will be of most use to people who  actually work in or very closely with semiconductor laser growth technology  and/or vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers.  I did come away knowing  lots more about these technologies than I did going into the chapters  (things like how and why lattice strain is used in the design of  semiconductor lasers, for example) but a more basic introduction would have  helpful to me.<br />Chapter 7 put me back into more familiar territory with  discussions about optical fiber components and devices.  Topics include  fiber dispersion compensators, fiber gratings, gratings in planar  waveguides, and high-power fiber lasers and amplifiers.  This chapter tends  to be at a high level, with little specific information or mathematical  equations.<br />Chapter 8 is really quite interesting.  The title is  &quot;Silicon Optical Bench Waveguide Technology.&quot;  Like chapters 5  and 6, chapter 8 gets into more detail about specific design and  manufacturability issues.  Since I have more background in this area,  though, I found the chapter at about the right level for me (it did not  leave me feeling as lost as chapters 5 and 6 did).  One of the most  interesting developments in this chapter (for me, at least) was the section  on Fourier filter multiplexers.  The chapter also has a relatively good  quantitative description (you will need to fill in some of the derivations  yourself) of couplers as well as star couplers and waveguide grating  routers.<br />Chapter 9 is a good discussion on lithium niobate integrated  optics, covering issues of design as well as performance and specification.   It also highlights their applications as switches, modulators, and  polarization scramblers/controllers as well as wavelength filters.  Chapter  10, the last chapter, reviews photonic switching technologies.  There is  some useful information about switching fabrics, along with generic  information about important specifications.<br />Both volumes have a good  index and extensive chapter references, making this one of the best  general-purpose desk reference volumes I've found for engineers involved in  lightwave communications systems.	2000-04-25
US	53038410	R206PWHCPQNH0F	0425174077	218502613	The Case of the Missing Neutrinos	Books	4	12	13	N	N	Covers lot of territory, but not in detail	This is a nice little book with 17 chapters and not quite 250 pages.  Each chapter is typically between 10 and 20 pages long, and reads more like an in-depth article that you might find in the science section of a  better-than-average newspaper.  These are high-level discussions for the  intelligent and informed &quot;man on the street.&quot;  As such, there are  no equations.  Unfortunately, there are no figures, illustrations,  pictures, charts, or tables, either.  <br />The title describes the case of  the missing neutrinos - referring, of course, to the fact that the flux of  solar neutrinos found in experiments is only about 1/3 the flux predicted  by the standard solar model, under the assumption of zero neutrino mass.   The book, though, discusses lots, lots more than just the missing neutrino  problem.  This is a collection of short essays on issues of primary  interest to physics - the hot topics of the day.  The book is a joy to read  - I bought it for the trip from Portland to Newark, and read it in just a  few hours.<br />Chapter 1 consists of speculation regarding the likelihood of  intelligent life elsewhere in the universe, and how likely it is that any  such extraterrestrial civilizations might count with, say, base eight  instead of base 10.  It's interesting to compare Gribbin's assumptions and  prejudices regarding the existence of extraterrestrial civilizations in  light of Ward's recent book, &quot;Rare Earth.&quot;  The idea of  intelligent extraterrestrial life is also extended in chapter 2, which also  includes a very brief and simplistic discussion of the history of life on  earth.<br />Chapter 3 reviews the evidence for the Milankovitch cycles, which  are associated with ice ages on earth.  The chapter predicts that the next  ice age is imminent, but does not include speculation about how the current  dumping of carbon dioxide and other &quot;green house gases&quot; might  affect its onset.   If you enjoy chapter 3, you'll also want to read&quot;Ice Ages,&quot; by John Imbrie and Katherine Palmer Imbrie.  You may  also want to read &quot;Is the temperature rising,&quot; by S. George  Philander.<br />Chapter 4 is a real gem.  It's called, &quot;How Darwin  Discovered Relativity.&quot;  It's an historical recantation of how  biologists discovered, through their study of the earth and evolution, that  the earth is many thousands of millions of years old.  However, at the time  there was no known way to keep the sun shinning for that long.  It drove  everyone nuts, and resulted in some pretty interesting ideas - all  classical, about how to provide earth with heat and life long enough for  species to evolve the way they have.   Eventually, of course, physicists  discovered the energy released in atomic fusion, and that solved the  problem.  It's a great little chapter that illustrates how progress in one  branch of science can stimulate progress in other branches.<br />Chapter 5  finally gets down to the book's title by introducing the fact that the sun  does not seem to be emitting the flux of neutrinos that the standard solar  model says it should.  Gribbin introduces several possibilities, including  the notion that neutrinos could have finite mass (in which case they can  oscillate from one type to another) and the idea that solar cycles may  result in the temperature dropping within the sun's core (blinking on and  off) and thus modulating the flux of neutrinos.   Gribbin develops these  concepts over several chapters (5, 6, and 7), and includes some fine  information about the history of measurements of the sun's diameter, and  the solar cycles that result in the size and luminosity of the sun  oscillating over time.<br />Chapter 8 is a fine summary of what happens in a  super nova.  Again, this is all very qualitative, and many details are  omitted, but Gribbin does a nice job of presenting the salient issues  involved in super novae and also gives some nice historical information and  context.Chapter 8, for example, illustrates super novae by describing SN  1987A.  If super novae interest you, check out &quot;The Supernova  Story&quot; by Laurence A. Marschall.<br />Chapter 9 is another one that I  truly enjoyed.  This chapter is mostly an historical accounting of the  discovery of pulsars by Jocelyn Bell.  It also includes some of the  historical highlights of Thomas Gold's explanation of pulsars as rotating  neutron stars.<br />The rest of the book deals mostly with cosmology.  Chapter  10 talks about galaxy formation, chapter 11 is an historical account of how  Eddington verified the general theory of relativity by measuring the  gravitational bending of starlight.  Chapter 12 is about the early  predictions of dark stars based on analysis done within the framework of  Newton's theory of gravitation, and the interesting idea that black holes  were really invented (discovered?) hundreds of years ago, long before the  observational evidence for their existence came about.<br />Chapter 13 touches  on some pretty controversial stuff about white holes and Narlikar's theory  of the steady-state universe.  Chapter 14 is called &quot;Time and the  Universe.&quot;  It's really about the second law of thermodynamics, and  attempts to use that, along with ideas in quantum mechanics, to explain  time's arrow.  Chapter 15 is a quick summary of white dwarfs, neutron  stars, black holes, and wormholes, and why empty space does not weigh  billions of tons per cubic centimeter.  The book ends with a chapter on  particle physics and a final chapter on inflation.  <br />As I said, I read  this book on a trip to New Jersey.  While I was there I visited the horn  antenna used by Arno Penzias and Bob Wilson when they inadvertently  stumbled across the microwave background radiation that confirmed the  &quot;big bang&quot; theory of the origin of the universe.  It seemed a  fitting end to the journey Gribbin took me on with his book.	2000-04-14
US	53038410	R3PN5HPNI0HRTZ	0830902732	86124043	Book of Mormon (Revised Authorized Version)	Books	5	30	56	N	N	Not true, but important to read	The Book of Mormon begins with the story of a man named Lehi who, at God's command, left Jerusalem roughly 600 BCE and fled into the &quot;wilderness.&quot;  Through various turns, Lehi (who was actually the  leader of two family units) found his way through what appears to have been  the Arabian Desert, to the seashore. Here, Lehi's sons constructed a ship  upon which the families sailed to the American continent.  The Book of  Mormon is thus the story of Hebrews that came to American over 2,000 years  ago, and who's descendants we know as American Indians.  In this respect,  the book reflects the contemporary attitudes of Joseph Smith's New England  upbringing in early 19'Th century America.<br />Shortly after arriving in the  Promised Land Lehi dies and his son, Nephi becomes the spiritual leader.   Nephi's older brothers resent Nephi and in the ensuing strife the people  become divided.  One group follows Nephi, becoming the Nephites.  The other  group becomes the Lamanites - followers of Laman.  The resulting physical  and spiritual contention between the two groups constitutes a major theme  that exists throughout the book.<br />The Book of Mormon describes the  Nephites as &quot;white and delightsome, and says that God cursed the  Lamanites with a skin of &quot;blackness&quot; so the Nephites would not be  attracted to them and their idolatrous ways.  Mormon doctrine and tradition  has it that the native American Indians are the remnants of the Lamanites,  and the Book of Mormon thus attempts to describe both the dark skin and  perceived benighted nature of the native Americans as seen through the  book's author, Joseph Smith.<br />The Book of Mormon is a mix of both  spiritual and historical narrative.  Much of the book goes into theological  discussions of issues that were vexing in Joseph Smith's day, and there are  long stretches where the book quotes extensively from the book of Isaiah.    These parts can be dry, but if you can get past the worst of it,and into  the Book of Mosiah, the story picks up a bit.<br />By the middle of the book  the Nephite and Lamanite civilizations have grown into impressive cultures  that covered the land from north to south and east to west.  The Book of  Mormon says they had silk, used what appear to be metal coins as money,  cultivated grains (which they brought from Old World) such as wheat and  barley, and domesticated animals such as cattle.  They also domesticated  horses and used them to pull chariots as they fought numerous wars using  swords made of steel.  You can read an on-line version of the Book of  Mormon, and do simple word searches at  [...]<br />The book of Mormon actually  describes three migrations from the Old World to the new.  One of these  consisted of a second migration from Jerusalem at about the same time as  Lehi.  It was led by one of the sons of Zedekia, and lived apart from the  Nephites until discovered by them many generations later, at which point  the groups merged.  The Nephites also found the remains of a civilization  that originated in the Old World around the time of the tower of Babel and  which migrated to the Americas around 2000 BCE.  This civilization  destroyed itself through civil war before being discovered by a lost band  of Nephites who stumbled upon their impressive cities in &quot;the land  northward.&quot;  Among their finds, the Nephites recovered metal plates  with a history of the people, along with tales of their military hardware,  including rusted swords.<br />A common theme throughout the Book of Mormon is  that America is the Promised Land, and that only those nations that worship  Jesus will be brought to America.  Furthermore, it says that those American  civilizations that don't worship Jesus will be destroyed.  This perspective  helps explain the Mormon compulsion for compelling political enforcement of  private behavior and religious intrusions in institutions such as public  schools.  In their minds the literal existence of American society hangs in  the balance and constitutional freedoms are a small price to pay.<br />There  is also an account of Jesus visiting the Nephites and Lamanites.  Again we  find lots of stuff copied from the Bible, including whole passages that are  repeated (almost) word for word.  So profound was Jesus' visit to the  people that after leaving them they lived in peace for several hundred  years - a remarkable thing from the book's perspective, since the whole  story line up to this point is one of nearly constant warfare between the  Nephites and Lamanites.<br />During this time of peace the people merged into  one civilization.  Eventually, though, they returned to their war-making  ways and segregated again into Nephites and Lamanites - this time, though,  it was along ideological grounds and not racial ones.  A long series of  wars ensues and eventually the Lamanites kill all the Nephites except for a  man named Moroni, who was the son of Mormon, who was one of the last  writers in the book, and from whom the book takes its title.  Moroni, last  of his people, buries the plates of gold that contain the Book of  Mormon.<br />That's the end of the Book of Mormon.  It's arrival on the modern  scene resumes in the early 1800 when Moroni returns as a resurrected angle  and tells Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day  Saints, where to find the gold plates and how to translate them. <br />All but  the most ardent supporters of Mormonism realized long ago that the Book of  Mormon is not a real description of ancient America.  To some extent,  though, that distinction is irrelevant.  It is scripture to Mormons and the  foundation of their religion.  As such, it affects the lives and attitudes  of a growing number of people who have increasing political power and  influence in American society.  It should, therefore, be read and  understood by all educated individuals.	2000-04-06
US	53038410	R2WJGWHSNGA6ZU	0387987010	293584016	Rare Earth: Why Complex Life is Uncommon in the Universe	Books	4	307	323	N	N	Still to early for final conclusions	There is a long tradition among humans that we are not aloneinthe universe - that there are other worlds with other intelligentbeings such as ourselves.  This tradition is found in many religions and embodied in some scientific thought.  The late Carl Sagan, for example, surmised the existence of one million civilizations capable of interstellar communications in the Milky Way galaxy.  Ward and Brownlee take exception to these estimates. According to the authors, microbial life is common in the universe &quot;but even the simplest animal life is exceedingly rare.&quot; Instead of millions of such civilizations in the Milky Way galaxy there might be just a few. There might be just one.<br />One of the things I liked most about this book its very nice summary of the history of earth. Chapter 1 has some interesting information about recent discoveries regarding the environments in which extremophiles live.  It might seem incredible to us, but extremophiles actually thrive in very high temperatures, pressures, and pH levels that we would find terribly fatal.  The wide range of environments in which the simplest life forms can live gives rise to the greater probability of finding them throughout the universe.  Extremophiles not only thrive in such environments, they can also tolerate brief forays into space aboard debris ejected from meteor impacts, and they can escape harsh surface conditions by living deep under ground.<br />The second chapter introduces us to the concept of habitable zones.  For extremophiles the habitable zones are quite large, so planets harboring such life can be found in a wider range of orbits around a wider range of stars.  More complex life, however, requires far smaller ranges in environmental conditions, leading to a much-reduced habitable zone.  Habitable zones must also exist over sufficiently long periods of time for life to evolve.  In other words, the habitable zone has both spatial and a temporal components.  The upshot is that habitable zones for complex life are pretty small, and may not exist at all unless the star is quite similar to ours. <br />Chapter three describes some of the critical components for a habitable earth, including the creation of hydrogen and helium (and a bit of lithium) in the Big Bang, and the creation of heavier elements in stars.  The earth needed to form from an inter-stellar accumulation rich in metals with the right amount of water.  The authors argue that such conditions are rare in the universe, and that planets such as ours are rare as well.<br />Chapter four discusses the conditions on earth after the initial bombardment stopped, during the earth's early formation.  This chapter has some very interesting material suggesting how bacteria, archaea, and eucarya form the earliest tree of life. Chapter 5 continues by describing how Eucarya are differentiated from the archaeans and the bacteria.  Eucarya include the animals, ciliates, fungi, plants, flagellates, and microspordia that constitute the complex life that the authors claim is so rare in the universe. The key piece of evidence regarding eucarya is that they took a long time to evolve in earth's history.  The message in this fact, according to the authors, is that eucarya require a more specialized environment in which to evolve - a narrower habitable zone - and that this environment must persist for long periods of time.  All of which argues against this type of life being common in the universe.<br />Chapter 6 is called &quot;Snowball Earth,&quot; and describes the earliest known ice ages on earth, which date to 2.4 billion and 800 to 650 million years BP.  These ice ages, in contrast to the one a few tens of thousands of years ago, literally covered the entire earth and froze the oceans over.  These ice ages could have helped to stimulate the evolution of animals, and (just as importantly) they also show that major environmental changes - changes that can cause mass extinction - have and can occur on earth.Timing and the extreme nature of the events are critical to the evolution of life.<br />The real centerpiece of this book is chapter 7, which discusses the enigma of the Cambrian explosion.  Perhaps no other event in earth's history has generated as much debate and speculation as the comparatively sudden rise in complexity of animal species that accompanied the Cambrian explosion.  The authors argue that the triggers for this explosion (and they offer several possible candidates) are necessary for the evolution of complex life, but they are also rare - adding further emphasis to their hypothesis that complex life in the universe is rare.<br />Chapter 8 describes mass extinctions and threats to animal life.  Chapter 9 raises some interesting issues about the importance of plate tectonics and argues that the evolution of animal life requires plate tectonics to maintain biodiversity and to stabilize global climate.  Chapter 10 discusses the importance of the moon in creating tides, contributing to orbital stability (and possibly contributing to plate tectonics) and Jupiter, which cleans the solar system of planet-crossing projectiles that could sterilize earth.  Again, the point is that these conditions are rare, and so planets with complex life are also rare.<br />Chapter 11 describes ways in which the rare-earth hypothesis might be tested, and chapter 12 reassesses the odds of complex life in the universe via a modified form of the Drake equation.  I found chapter 12 a bit of a disappointment, though, since the authors never really stick there necks out and make a claim for how many planets with complex life might exist in the galaxy.  The final chapter discusses the philosophical and ethical implications of the rare-earth hypothesis, including the role people play in the current extinction crisis. <br />This is a first-rate book.  The notes are detailed, the index complete, the text clear and understandable.  The argument is lucid and in many (though not all) wayscompelling.  And, of course, it's hard to think of subject matter more relevant.	2000-04-05
US	53038410	R34KPSHNR7NDLD	0780353994	618301683	Introduction to DWDM Technology: Data in a Rainbow	Books	1	70	71	N	N	Too many mistakes	I saw this book on display as I passed the SPIE booth at OFC'00 on Sunday after picking up my registration material for the show.  I took the top copy from a stack of 12.  By the time I finished leafing through the pages  the stack was gone.  They were selling like hotcakes.  Scanning the book, I  found plenty of equations (so I figured it must not be too superficial) and  (I'm ashamed to say) the color figures particularly caught my attention.   Always anxious to catch a new perspective, I put my plastic down and left  the convention hall feeling pretty happy about the great new book I just  purchased.<br />I started reading the book that evening, over dinner, and  finished it four days later on the flight home from Baltimore to Portland.   My earliest impressions were quickly shattered, however, as I realized less  than ten pages into the book that it was not going to measure up to my  earlier expectations.<br />One of the most prominent problems with this book  is that the author seems to be continually confused regarding his audience.   For example, on page 7 he plunks down Maxwell's equations with barely an  explanation, and yet several sentences later he goes into considerable  detail describing what is meant by phase, frequency, and wavelength of a  wave.  Clearly, if you can read Maxwell's equations without explanation the  discussion about elementary attributes of waves is wholly unnecessary.  On  the other hand, if a person reading the book needs to be told what  frequency is, then Maxwell's equations will look like meaningless  gibberish.  <br />Another surprising problem with the book are the many  technical errors and typographical mistakes.  I found these to be the most  troublesome, since they can lead to real confusion on some important topics  for anyone who is new to the topic of WDM.  Here is an example from page  117:<br /> \\"Optical amplifiers require electrical or optical energy to excite  (pump-up) the state of electron-hole pairs.  Energy is typically provided  by injecting electrical current (in SOA: Figure 8.2) or optical light in  the UV range (in EDFA).\\"  <br />This isn't just a typographical error because  the author repeats the mistake on page 119 where he says:<br /> \\"The EDFA is  stimulated by a higher optical frequency (in the UV range) laser source,  known as the pump.\\"<br />Anyone familiar with EDFA optical amplifiers used in  telecommunications will immediately realize that this is wrong.  EDFAs are  pumped at 1480 nm or 980 nm (both in the near IR).  They are not pumped in  the UV.  In fact, the author clearly states that \\"erbium ions may be  excited by a number of optical frequencies - 514 nm, 532 nm, 667 nm, 800  nm, 980 nm, and 1480 nm.\\" (see page 118).   This is a good example of the  misleading, false, and contradictory information that creeps into this book  far too often, and is likely to cause a good deal of confusion for people  new to WDM technology, and a good deal of aggravation for the rest.  I  could go on with other examples, but this should be adequate to prove the  point.<br />Some of the book's problems are more annoying than dangerous.  For  example, the author introduces the reader to light using photometric units  rather than the more commonly used (in telecom, anyway) radiometric units.   The author also has a tendency to wander in his descriptions, introducing  ideas out of sequence and repeating ideas that have been already developed.   Overall, the book reads a little like crib notes, with some important  subjects having their own bold-faced headings but only a sentence or two of  discussion.   One of the biggest shortfalls is the book's failure to  address polarization mode dispersion.  It devotes only one short  description (in the whole book, as far as I can recall): <br /> \\"This  phenomenon (PMD) is not well understood or theoretically explained,  although it is known and demonstrated via experiments.\\" (see page 54).   <br />Clearly, lots more could (and should)have been said about PMD in a book  of this sort.<br />Reading this book I got the distinct impression that it was  rushed to print too soon.   The subject matter (DWDM) is good, and the  book's organization is appropriate, it just needs to be polished a bit,  filled in where the discussion is too truncated, and have the mistakes and  typographical errors corrected.  The plan and overall organization, though,  are actually pretty nice.  The book is organized into three parts.  Part  one is an overview of the nature of light and the interaction of photons  with matter.  Subjects include Snell's law, critical angle, diffraction,  holography, polarization, and some really elementary discussions about  nonlinear effects.<br />Part two deals with optical components, beginning with  optical fiber, filters, gratings, demultiplexers, light sources,  photodetectors, couplers, isolators, polarizers, optical cross-connects,  and add-drop multiplexers.  This sounds like a lot of ground to cover - and  it is - but the author does it all in about 120 pages, so you can  appreciate that none of the discussions goes into much detail.<br />Part three  is devoted to different coding techniques, and describes return to zero,  non-return to zero, ASK, PSK, and FSK formats.  Part four describes the  specifics of WDM, and in many respects it repeats what was said in part  two.  Part five summarizes current issues and research (something that I  personally find problematical in a book, as it immediately dates it).  The  book comes with a long list of acronyms (a plus) and pretty complete  references at the end of each section (also a plus).  The index is also  nicely done and complete.  <br />Overall, though, this book is probably not  worth your time or money.  If you want a good introduction to modern  telecommunications, I suggest \\"Optical Fiber Telecommunications III\\" (A and  B) by Kaminow and Koch.  These books are more expensive, but far more  accurate and complete.<br />Duwayne Anderson, March 17, 2000	2000-03-18
US	53038410	R1KS8O0E1OQ8WY	0471296511	755727306	Life's Other Secret: The New Mathematics of the Living World	Books	5	31	33	N	N	DNA may not be the last word	Stewart begins his book by telling the reader:<br />\\"I am going to try to convince you that as wonderful as genes are, they are not the whole answer to the question of life.  More radically, I am also going to try to  convince you that a full understanding of life depends upon  mathematics.\\"<br />Basically, Stewart believes that scientists have  overemphasized genetics and ignored (or at least under emphasized) the role  of what I'll call large-scale or macro rules of physics and chemistry and  the comparatively simple mathematics that describe them.  For example, a  molecular biologist might see a striped shell and wonder which genes caused  them.  Stewart would be more inclined to ask if there isn't some sort of  chemical diffusion equation that leads to the stripes without them being  specifically encoded in the genes.  The point is that DNA may not need to  encode much detail in many cases because the detail arises spontaneously  out of macroscopic laws. <br />Stewart has studied at the Santa Fe Institute  in New Mexico.  Other prominent scientists associated with the Institute  are Murray Gell-Mann and Stuart Kauffman.  Kauffman, in particular, has  conducted studies regarding emergent properties of self-catalytic systems  and you can see the influence of his thinking in much of Ian Stewart's book  (see Stuart Kauffman's book \\"At home in the universe, the search for laws  of self organization and complexity\\").<br />The book begins with discussions  relating to the nature of life and musings about DNA and replication.  It's  interesting to see the line between life and non-life blur under Stewart's  prose.  Chapter three discusses the emergence of DNA, possible roles played  by clay platelets, and the idea that DNA might be just a frozen accident -  the molecule was picked because it evolved first and created an environment  in which no others could get a start once DNA was established.  <br />Chapter  four is called the oxygen menace.  There is an interesting discussion of  how prokaryotes might have evolved, created oxygen as a poisonous  byproduct, oxygenated the atmosphere, and then evolved into eukaryotes to  capitalize on a more efficient method of generating energy by burning fuel  using oxygen in the new atmosphere.  This chapter has some interesting  stuff on how cells move using the cytoskeleton and microtubules.  I also  enjoyed the description of slime-mold colonies and how they illustrate the  possible manner in which larger organisms evolved from cooperative colonies  of less complex life forms. <br />Chapter five is titled artificial life, but  much of it deals strictly with the process of evolution among very  un-artifical forms.    There is a discussion about the famous finches on  the Galapagos Islands and how they stimulated Darwin to understand how  species evolve.  There is also some interesting material on numerical  taxonomy, evolutionary taxonomy, and cladism.  Finally, the end of the  chapter distills the discussion into general principles of evolution and  how simple computer programs (artificial life) can illustrate many of the  patterns we see in the real world among living species.<br />The first five  chapters are really just background information about the first life on our  planet, the evolution of DNA, and general principles of evolution.   Stewart's real thesis (and the real fun) begins in chapter 6 with flowers  for Fibonacci.  Ever wonder why the seeds in a sunflower spiral the way  they do?  Ever wonder why there are the numbers of petals you find in  flowers?  Chapter 6 has the surprisingly simple answer, and it doesn't  require lots of information encoding in DNA sequences, either.  <br />Chapter  7 is a little more controversial than chapter 6.  It attempts to show that  patterns in living organisms might not be specifically encoded in DNA, but  might result from gradient chemical reactions and diffusion in some  species.  In other words, DNA only needs to encode the production of the  right chemicals at the right time and macroscopic rules using rather simple  mathematics do the rest.<br />Chapter 8 deals with speculation about sexual  selection and how it relates to such things as the peacock's tail.  In this  chapter Stewart argues that in many instances the thing that is being  selected is actually symmetry.  Asymmetry can be a sign of a damaged or  defective organism.  The thing I enjoyed most from this chapter was the  discussion about common hallucinations and how they might result from the  way simple plane waves in the visual cortex map into our retina.<br />Chapter  9 was my favorite.  It describes hypothetical harmonic generators that work  together in various relative relationships of phase and attenuation to  produce the natural gaits of quadrupeds and even bipeds.  Stewart has done  original work in this area, and so this chapter has some of the most  insight and technical backup.  I've often wondered about this myself and  contemplated the possibility that such natural harmonic generators might be  somehow related to the tendency of our species to develop certain musical  beats and to naturally move in rhythm with them.<br />Of course you will want  to read chapter ten, which shows how rather simple rules can lead to rather  complex looking spider webs.  And don't forget to read chapter 11 which  discusses the complex interrelationships of reefs, along with some rather  interesting information regarding Von Neumann's amazing insights.<br />This  isn't a book on mathematics - it's a book about how mathematics applies to  biology.  And it's mostly qualitative.  There are no mathematical  equations, for example.<br />Overall, I think this is a first-rate book.  It's  well written, engaging, has a complete index, copious notes, good figures,  and brilliant color plates that I especially appreciated.  You don't have  to agree with everything Stewart has to say, but I think you will find his  arguments intriguing, thought provoking, and stimulating regardless.  If  you love life and mathematics, this book should be in your  library.<br />Duwayne Anderson, March 18, 2000	2000-03-18
US	53038410	R1G3NK6VJDTC3H	0135343305	59029820	Fiber Optic Test and Measurement	Books	5	41	42	N	N	Everything you need to know about photonic T&amp;M	This is probably the most complete, accurate, and authoritative book I've seen that is devoted specifically to the science of testing fiber-optic systems and components.<br />The book begins by reviewing basic fiber-optic  communications systems.  It summarizes basic ideas in communications  theory, characteristics of optical fiber, optical amplifiers, optical  repeaters, O/E converters, and wavelength-division multiplexing.  The first  chapter also contains some useful background information about bit-error  rates and waveform analysis.  There are simple descriptions of multimode  fiber, and basic explanations of things like numerical aperture, chromatic  dispersion, and polarization characteristics of optical fiber.  There is  also some review material on active components such as Fabry-Perot lasers,  distributed-feedback lasers, vertical cavity surface-emitting lasers,  electrooptic modulators, and LEDs.  The first chapter ends with a review of  time and frequency measurements in photonic networks.  <br />The material in  the first chapter is pretty broad, and some of it is rather shallow.  It's  not really a good place to go for a primer on photonic networks, but the  first chapter does help the reader review key concepts and ideas that are  important in the book's later developments.<br />With the review completed,  the book launches into detailed discussions about different types of  measurements made in fiber-optic networks and on fiber-optic components.   Generally, each chapter deals with a separate topic, and is written by a  different author. <br />Chapter two discusses the nuances of making optical  power measurements.  While some may think that such measurements are  trivial, Christian Hentschel (the author of chapter 2) does an excellent  job of illustrating the precise engineering needed to make the most  accurate measurements of optical power.  Topics covered include temperature  effects, spatial effects, noise, reflectivity, and compatibility withvarious fiber and connector types.<br />Chapter three is of special interest  to anyone working in the field of wavelength-division multiplexing, as it's  subject matter deals with optical spectrum analysis.  A common theme  throughout this book is to describe many of the different ways in which  measurements can be performed.  True to that theme, Joachim Vobis and  Dennis Derickson (the authors of chapter 3) review the various ways in  which spectral analysis can be performed.  These include tunable filters  like the Fabry-Perot interferometers as well as diffraction-based OSAs.   The authors clearly prefer the grating OSA, and most of the chapter deals  with specific nuances that must be considered in making such and instrument  perform properly.  Chapter four is similar to chapter three - it deals also  with optical spectrum analysis.  Chapter four, though, is devoted  exclusively to the subject of wavelength meters that make spectral  measurements using a Michelson interferometer and stabilized internal light  source.<br />Chapter five covers high-resolution optical frequency analysis.   Chapter 6 deals with polarization measurements, including a review of the  Jones calculus and a nice explanation and description of the Stokes  parameters and Poincare sphere.  Chapter 7 describes intensity modulation  and noise characterization of optical signals.  Chapter 8 covers analysis  of digital modulation on optical carriers, including some nice material on  bit-error rates, eye-diagram analysis, mask measurements, and jitter  analysis.  Chapter 9 has some good information on insertion-loss  measurements (another of those underestimated problems).  Chapter 10 has a  good review of optical time-domain reflectometers (OTDRs) used in testing  components, while chapter 11 explains the use of OTDRs in making  measurements on optical fiber.  Chapter 12 covers dispersion measurements,  including both chromatic dispersion and polarization-mode dispersion.  The  last chapter explains the tests used to characterize erbium-doped optical  fibers (EDFAs).  This last chapter, especially, is well worth reading,  though I found some of the test descriptions a little hard to follow.<br />The  book ends with three very useful appendices.  Appendix A is devoted to  noise sources in optical measurements, appendix B to nonlinear limits for  optical measurements (a must for anyone working with DWDM systems) and  appendix C has some practical information regarding the care of optical  connectors.<br />The book covers a tremendous amount of information.  Its 642  pages are jam packed with just about everything you ever wanted to know  about photonic test and measurement.  And what it does not cover is usually  described in excruciating detail in the complete list of references at the  end of each chapter.  <br />There are plenty of equations, but not much  mathematical derivation.  If you are up on your algebra and calculus you  will have no difficulty following anything in this book.  Its aim is  practicality, and I'd say it hit a bull's eye.  <br />The illustrations are  done nicely; the explanations are (for the most part) clean, crisp, and  concise.  This is an excellent book that I highly recommend.  I've marked  it with yellow pen, dog-eared the corners of the pages, scribbled in the  margins, spilt my drink on it at least once, broken the spine, and  basically beat it to pieces.  That's what you do with the really useful  tools - the rest of them just sit on the shelf looking pretty and  collecting dust.<br />If you make your living testing photonic systems, you  really owe it to yourself to get and read this book.<br />Duwayne Anderson,  February 28, 2000	2000-02-28
US	53038410	R2D0GNUIVXUC3A	037570261X	102647171	Life: A Natural History of the First Four Billion Years of Life on Earth	Books	5	14	14	N	N	A natural history of life on earth	It's hard to imagine a more ambitious project than writing a natural history of the first four billion years of life on earth.  It's even harder to imagine writing it for the interested layperson without making too many  oversimplifications or leaving out too much important detail in a book with  just over 300 pages.  Richard Fortey has risen to the occasion though, and  in the process has created a book that's engaging and highly worth  reading.<br />You might expect a book like this to be mechanistic, starting at  the beginning and cranking by rote through the sequence of events that  constitute the earth's history.  Fortey doesn't do this.  In a cordial and  poetic style he first introduces us to the real world of paleontology.  A  world of dirt, grime and fierce winds on forsaken beaches bordering  forgotten islands of the far north.  This is where Fortey began his  carrier, and where he made a first mark in the study of extinct organisms  from earth's ancient past.  This first chapter is important because it  reminds us that our knowledge of earth's history has come in fitful starts  in which chance and luck have played a central roll.  Only a fraction of  all creatures leave fossilized remains, only a fraction of those are ever  found, and even then they must be interpreted through the preconceptions of  scientists.  The miracle is that we know anything at all - but we do, and  what a story it is.<br />Having introduced the working of paleontology, Fortey  devotes the second chapter to the origin of the first life forms.  This  chapter is of necessity the most barren of all.  We still don't understand  the origin of life, though there have been remarkable strides in recent  years.  The author describes the central importance of carbon and the fact  many carbon-based molecules necessary for life are found in  extraterrestrial objects (but he does not advocate the idea that first life  was extraterrestrial).  He makes a strong point for the proposition that  alllife originated with a common ancestor. <br />Much of Fortey's discussions  about first life discuss the roll that life played in creating our current  environment.  The atmosphere is literally a created thing, with the oxygen  we breathe constituting a poisonous gas given off by the first organisms on  earth.  This makes creatures like the chemolithoautotrophic  hyperthermophiles a little more understandable - first life evolved in an  environment that we today would find very inhospitable - and vise  versa.<br />From here the book pretty much follows in chronological order with  the Cambrian, Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian and Carboniferous periods.   The author explains how life first evolved in the seas, how it flourished,  about extinction, and the eventual migration of life onto land.   Fortey  does not simply recite history, though.  He has a style that brings these  ancient animals and ecosystems to life.  I particularly enjoyed his  recollection of conodonts.  Conodonts are tooth-like objects of calcium  phosphate that were used for years as a type of natural chronometer.  They  belonged to an extinct aquatic animal.  They changed as the animal evolved  over time and their presence in sedimentary deposits thus enabled  scientists to date the rocks in which they were found.  The problem was,  nobody knew what animal the conodonts belonged too.  There was much  speculation, and Fortey's telling of the story and its eventual resolution  is typical of the way he brings the subject to life.<br />Through all the  narrative Fortey does a reasonably good job of helping the reader  understand that life did not march onward and upward along a directed path.   This is a common misunderstanding, and one that chronological narratives  often give.  Life did not emerge from the seas and then rise to the air.   Rather, like an expanding gas, life evolved to fill unoccupied niches.    The simplest and oldest life forms still flourish, and if longevity is the  measure by which life is accounted, then we are just upstarts with our  few-million-year presence on earth. <br />There is, of course, the story of  the dinosaurs.  The neat twist offered by Fortey is to show how our  understanding and perception of the dinosaurs has changed over time.  He  compares what we know of them today with how we perceived them years ago.    I found this particularly interesting because I can recall as a little boy  reading how dinosaurs were slow, had two brains (one in the head and one in  the tail) and had to live in water to support their weight.  Observing how  our perceptions of dinosaurs have change so dramatically in my lifetime is  a real-life dramatization of science at work.<br />The dinosaurs have changed  our understanding of evolution as well.  In times past dinosaurs were  synonymous with failure to evolve and change - they disappeared because  they were outmoded.  Fortey explains how luck and chance are essential  parts of the evolutionary process.  The dinosaurs were superbly adapted  animals.  They are gone because of bad luck - a bolide from space - and we  are here because some nondescript little mammals just happened to be lucky  enough have the right equipment for surviving in the new environment.  What  had been good for survival changed in an instant, and changed the course of  evolution.<br />The book ends with a chapter describing the search for our  past and an epilogue on chance and evolution.  This is a pretty brief  chapter that summarizes the fossil evidence for human evolution and  describes our earliest ancestors down to roughly the last ice age.   <br />I  truly enjoyed reading this book.  It is well written and it has a useful  glossary and a very complete index.  The style of writing is informative  yet colorful and full of imagery.  Written by someone with an obvious zest  for life - \\"Life\\" is a top-caliber book and one you won't regret investing  the time to read and savor.<br />Duwayne Anderson, February 22, 2000	2000-02-23
US	53038410	RDG56WB79S31Q	0393046885	458870497	The Elegant Universe: Superstrings, Hidden Dimensions, and the Quest for the Ultimate Theory	Books	5	47	52	N	N	A theory of everything (TOE)	Matter, we all know, consists of atoms, which consist of a nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a mist of electrons. Protons and neutrons are made of quarks.  The fundamental particles in the standard theory are organized in three families.  The first family consists of the familiar electron, electron neutrino, the up quark, and the down quark.  The other families contain similar particles, having identical electrical, weak, and strong charges, but having different masses.  There are also particles for the strong force (gluon), electromagnetic force (photon), weak force (weak gauge bosons) and gravity (graviton).<br />String theory tells us that these fundamental particles are not really so fundamental after all. Instead, the vibrations of a tiny one-dimensional loop of string within define the physical properties of each of the fundamental &quot;According to string theory, the properties of an elementary &quot;particle&quot; - its mass and its various force charges - are determined by the precise resonant pattern of vibrations that its internal string executes.&quot;<br />There are no known experimental circumstances in which the standard theory disagrees with experiments in quantum mechanics.  Similarly, there is no known experimental circumstance in which the general theory of relativity conflicts with measurements in the cosmos.  Yet scientists realize that these theories - successful as they are - cannot be complete because they are mutually inconsistent.  Before superstring theory, however, all attempts to reconcile the general theory of relativity on a quantum scale have failed.  This is the impetus for the search for the &quot;theory of everything,&quot; or TOE, and it is the subject of Brian Greene's book.<br />Greene begins with a high-level summary of string theory, encapsulating the essential elements of the theory in the idea that the resonant patterns and energy of string filaments within define fundamental particles.  He then outlines the problems between the general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, which is the driving force behind the quest for a unified theory.  In laying this foundation he gives crisp and clear descriptions of the ideas in relativity as they pertain to time and space - showing how Einstein turned our past notions of these things upside down.<br />Next, Greene describes quantum weirdness, and how quantum theory, like relativity, attacks our sensibilities and intuition.  There are the usual discussions of the double-slit experiment along with a brief discussion of Feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics in which particles are viewed as traveling along every possible path through space and time and engaging in the weirdness of self-interference.<br />With the essential ideas in quantum physics and general relativity established, Greene shows how these theories - successful as they are - cannot be complete because each is incompatible with the other in its own sphere of influence.  Greene then makes the critical case for string theory.  Among his repertoire of evidence, the most commonly cited are aspects of symmetry and beauty.  Unlike the standard theory, string theory does not dabble in tables of measured data, which are then incorporated into the theory. The standard model is impressive, but not until you first measure the charges and masses of the fundamental particles.  String theory, on the other hand, is &quot;unique and inflexible .... It requires no input beyond a single number ... [and] all properties of the microworld are within the realm of its explanatory power.&quot;<br />The real problem with the theory is that it is so mathematically intense that nobody can solve the theory's equations exactly.  In fact, it's so difficult that only approximations for the equations are known - even the exact equations have proven elusive thus far.  This makes it hard to press the case for superstring theory.  Greene Signatures&quot;) devoted to physical evidence in supportof the theory, but the evidence so far is pretty thin.  Among the most encouraging results is the fact that superstring theory requires the graviton.  In principle, superstring theory can be used to calculate the masses and electric charges of the fundamental particles, but so far the mathematics has proven intractable.<br />Much of the book deals with the mathematical issues that are blocking present progress (though in a strictly quantitative fashion - there are no equations). There are some good discussions about higher dimensions (superstring theory demands them) and the warping of space.  I found the discussion of M-theory especially interesting.  You see, there are several superstring theories, and M-theory explains how they are really all just different manifestations of the same.<br />About 2/3 of the book deals with historical backgrounds in general relativity, the standard model, and developments in superstring theory.  I expected more subject matter on cosmology, but that's okay.  The book is great as written.  There is a chapter on black holes and how superstring theory helps us understand them better.  There is also a chapter on cosmology and implications for superstring there.  Among other things, superstring theory helps us deal with the problems of a mathematical singularity in the explanation of the big bang, but the jury is still out on superstring theory and singularities in black holes.<br />The book ends with a chapter on future prospects, and it has a very useful section containing endnotes for the various chapters (I highly recommend reading the endnotes).  To top it off, there is a wonderfully useful index, and the figures are all nicely done (though I would have included more figures - that's my only complaint).<br />This is a wonderful book.  It's written at an intelligent level, but does not burden the reader with the almost intractable mathematics of string theory.  Greene has done a masterful job of explaining in clearly illuminated terms the ideas of what may be the most important theoretical study of the next century.  If you enjoy intellectual stimulation and thoughts that will make your head swim, then this is a book you really must read. <br />Duwayne Anderson, February 03, 2000	2000-02-03

On the one hand I yearn for knowledge of the universe, how it works, why our world is the way it is, and I marvel at the accomplishments of technology and science.

These are the words of  timeless wisdom from a people who found the meaning of oneness with nature.

US	53038410	R2HEVLLC12O8ZD	0691009260	982057278	The Odd Quantum	Books	5	262	266	N	N	A no-nonsense book with  a little mathematics.	In the opening introduction, Dr. Treiman explains that he wanted to write a book on quantum physics that was somewhere between the mathematical treatments one typically finds in graduate and advanced undergraduate  texts, and the almost purely philosophical, \\"no equations allowed\\" armchair  reading so common in the popular press.  I believe that Dr. Treiman has  been largely successful in achieving this goal, and I found \\"The Odd  Quantum\\" to be one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long  while.<br />It's not hard to find books in the popular press such as   \\"Schrodinger's Kittens and the search for reality\\" that deal with the  subject of quantum physics.   There are other examples, but all of them  share one thing in common -- an almost complete lack of any real  quantitative analysis or any equations.  Some authors complain that a  book's popularity has a kind of mathematical inverse relationship between  the number of equations in the book and the number of books sold.  The  result is a plethora of books that deal qualitatively with philosophical  issues upon which almost anyone will feel qualified to  speculate.<br />Treiman's book is not of that ilk.  True, this is not a  mathematically rigorous book, nor does it develop many of the mathematical  nuances found in modern quantum theory.  But the book is no mathematical  slouch, either.  Without requiring a tremendous amount of mathematical  skill, Trieman manages to bring out many of the most interesting aspects of  quantum theory with clearly elucidated equations.  <br />It's a little  difficult deciding exactly what level of mathematical expertise Treiman had  in mind for his readers.  On the one hand, he presents Maxwell's equations  with apology for the mathematical form, yet in later parts of the book he  includes much of the same mathematical formalism (partial differentials,  for example) with apparent expectation on the part of the reader.  I  suspect that his perception of the reader's grasp ofmathematics is someone  who has at least completed a first semester of calculus.  Mathematical  subjects covered in the book include integration, differentiation, partial  differentiation, and some common mathematical operators.  The author  develops the linear non-relativistic Schrodinger equation, and if you can  handle that level of mathematics the rest of the text should present no  problem.<br />Another feature of this book is its no-nonsense approach.  The  author does not delve into issues such as parallel worlds, or even too much  of the meaning of reality.  These are all common subjects in most armchair  texts on quantum theory, but Treiman's book pretty much ignores all that in  favor of a basic mathematical description of the core issues in quantum  mechanics.   This is an ideal text as a companion for an introductory class  in quantum mechanics, or as a refresher course for those who have studied  the subject, but not been actively involved with it since their formal  education.  Mathematically inclined individuals who have not yet studied  quantum physics, but wish a basic understanding of the subject would also  enjoy it.<br />Treiman follows the traditional historical approach.  He begins  with a review of classical physics, including Newton's law of gravitation,  the theory of relativity, conservation of energy, and classical  electromagnetism.   He then proceeds to outline the basic principles of the  \\"old\\" quantum physics, including developments around the problem of  black-body radiation, early work in spectroscopy, the Rutherford atom,  Bohr's quantum model, and De Broglie's matter waves.  <br />With this  introduction properly made, Treiman proceeds to describe the foundation of  modern quantum mechanics by laying out the two-slit experiment and  Schroedinger's wave equation (linear and non-relativistic).  There is a  nice discussion of the probabilistic interpretation of the Schroedinger  equation, and a quite useful summary of the basic rulesthat define modern  quantum mechanics.  Treiman also does a good job of laying the foundation  in such important areas as commuting observables and how that ties in with  the venerated uncertainty principle.  As part of this foundational  discussion Treiman describes the concept of an operator, and then proceeds  to derive several common operators used in quantum physics, such as the  Hamiltonian, momentum, and position operators.  [I listed them by hand in  the back of the book, but it would have been nice had the author summarized  these important equations in the text.]  The foundational material finishes  with discussions on angular orbital momentum, spin, and tunneling.<br />With  the foundations properly established the author proceeds to solve several  classic problems in quantum mechanics, including the free particle,  particle in a one-dimensional box, and the harmonic oscillator. There is  also a very nice discussion about the fermi gas and some important  distinctions between fermions and bosons, along with a good summary section  describing the quantum numbers and conventions used when describing the  energy levels of various atoms. <br />The book's last chapters include one  titled `What's going on?\\" which delves more into the philosophical issues  associated with quantum physics, and a final chapter that deals with  quantum fields.  <br />In summary, this is an excellent companion or refresher  text.  It's a relatively short book, though, having only about 260 pages.   I would have enjoyed having more illustrations, and the index is too short.   Overall, however, the book is just what I was looking for - something  that's not quite intellectual pabulum, but not so mathematically involved  that it cannot be read by a hot fire with a cup of tea the hour before  bedtime.<br />Duwayne Anderson, January 30, 2000	2000-01-30
US	53038410	R2JLQ9WKPD64H5	052136860X	818139313	Advanced Mathematical Methods for Engineering and Science Students	Books	5	34	35	N	N	A great reference book	This is not a book about advanced mathematics for mathematicians, but rather (as the title says) a book about advanced mathematical methods for practicing engineers, scientists, and students.<br />The number of subjects  covered is truly impressive in such a relatively short book (only about 250  pages).  Because of its brevity, though, I'd not recommend this book as a  first course in mathematics for engineers and scientists (though the  authors suggest it might be used that way).  For a first course, I'd  recommend a more complete text such as the one I used as an undergraduate  (C. Ray Wylie, &quot;Advanced Engineering Mathematics,&quot; McGraw-Hill  Book Company, 1975).  Although Stephenson and Radmore actually cover more  material, Wylie's book has roughly twice as many pages, with more  mathematical rigor and much more detail.<br />Although I don't recommend  Stephenson and Radmore as a first text on the subject, I think it makes an  excellent reference book, and would be a useful text as part of a refresher  course taken by graduate students.  This is a concise text that brings to  your finger tips a broad assortment of valuable mathematical knowledge.  The information is arranged (for the most part) so that it is easy to find,  and easy to discern the important summary points.<br />The book has 9  chapters.  The first chapter is a nice review of tensor algebra.  The  authors do a good job of dealing with the tensor notation without being too  cryptic (something other books on tensor algebra fail to do).  Chapter 2  deals with special functions, including gamma and Bessel functions.  This  is a pretty easy chapter, and is arranged in a particularly useful manner  for a reference text.<br />Chapters 3 and 4 deal with non-linear ordinary  differential equations.  As with the other chapters in this book, there is  relatively little development along the lines of mathematical proofs.  Many  of the methods are simply explained without the benefit of deeper  understanding about why and how the methods work.  This is fine (as I said)  for a reference book.  In fact, it is preferable.  But, it is one of the  reasons I'd not recommend this book for a first course (though it would  make a great textbook for a graduate course with students already familiar  with much of the material).<br />One of the things I truly enjoyed about this  book is the number of worked examples.  The authors typically present a  concept or method, and then work through several examples that illustrate  how the method or concept works.  On the negative side, however, few of the  worked examples deal with actual physical problems.  While this is not  always necessary, it would have been nice in a book that is targeted for  engineering and science students.<br />Chapters 5 and 6 deal with calculus in  the complex plane, specifically contour integration.  As with the other  chapters, these chapters are relatively brief (only about 60 pages  together) but jam-packed with all sorts of useful information.  This is one  of the best summaries of contour integration that I've seen.  Virtually all  the pertinent information that engineering or science students would need  on the subject is found here, along with applicable worked examples to  emphasize key principles and ideas.<br />Chapter 7 deals with the Laplace and  Fourier transforms, with almost all the emphasis on Laplace transforms.  The authors develop ideas that are general, and based on the idea of an  integral transform using an arbitrary kernel.  They then introduce the  Laplace kernel and develop a number of key theorems, along with worked  examples, around the Laplace kernel.  They finish the chapter with a brief  summary of how the ideas based on the Laplace transform apply also to the  Fourier transform.<br />Chapter 8 deals with partial differential equations.  I found this chapter to be among the most abbreviated.  Entire books have  been written on the subject, but this chapter is only 28 pageslong.  Although the authors present many famous partial differential equations  from science and engineering, they really do not develop the ideas with  those in mind.  This chapter is possibly more mathematically abstract than  most students of engineering and physical sciences would prefer, but still  an excellent source of summary information on the subject.<br />My favorite  was chapter 9.  This chapter is a great little summary of the calculus of  variations.  There is an interesting derivation of Euler's equation, and  several worked examples that I liked.  The authors also introduce the  Lagrangian in this chapter, and offer two examples (a swinging pendulum and  spring-coupled weights) showing how the Lagrangian is used to derive the  equations of motion for dynamic systems.  Note again, however, the  abbreviated style.  Stephenson and Radmore introduce the Lagrangian and  give examples using only three pages.  By contrast, my copy of Bradbury (T.  C. Bradbury, &quot;Theoretical Mechanics,&quot; Wiley, 1968) devotes  significant parts of several chapters to the subject.<br />In summary, this is  an excellent reference text for individuals already familiar (or at least  somewhat familiar) with the information.  It's an excellent text for  reviewing the information as a book read cover to cover, or for finding the  solution to a mathematical problem in a pinch.  The material is condensed  but accurate and nicely organized.  It also has problems at the end of each  chapter, with the answers in the back for the self-directed student.  My  only real complaint is that the index is rather brief.<br />Overall, though,  this is a great book.  If you are a student of engineering or science, and  if you work with mathematics, you really should have this book in your  library.  Keep in mind, though, that this is a book on mathematics.  There  are hundreds of equations in this book, and some pages where few words in  English appear.<br />January 3, 2000	2000-01-03

This book wasn't what I expected.  I'd wanted a book with academic validity that would discuss the nuances of human behavior in everyday life, particularly from a standpoint of our evolutionary past.  I suppose it's my own fault.  I picked it up while browsing an airport bookstore and failed  to take the time to scan it properly.  So instead of getting what I wanted,  I got a book that's a little bit Martha Stewart, a little bit psychology  101, a little bit common sense, and a lot of best-seller baloney.  [I  suspect Jo-Ellan realizes the shoddy nature of the book's academic value,  as she has prominently displayed &quot;Ph.D.&quot; next to her name on the  book's cover, presumably in an attempt to give it more validity than it  deserves.]<br />Jo-Ellan and her co-author are from the legal profession, and  have participated actively in some rather high-profile cases like the O. J.  Simpson trial.  She makes her living by helping lawyers stack the jury.  Of  course Jo-Ellan would never actually put it that way.  In fact, I'm sure  the authors would disagree with that characterization.  On page 12, for  example, Jo-Ellan says: &quot;I have only one goal: to assemble a group of  people who will listen with an open mind to my client's side of the  story.&quot;  That's the talk, but she doesn't walk the walk.  After  telling us her high-minded religion, Jo-Ellan proceeds to give one example  after another showing how open mindedness is the last thing she wants in a  jury.  What she really wants (and this is how she makes her money) is to  find jurors who will vote for her clients regardless of the facts.  <br />For  example, on page 35 the authors explain how they &quot;conduct research to  identify predictive traits, characteristics likely to have the greatest  influence on a juror's beliefs...We record their age, sex, and race....From  their replies we determine which traits most frequently appear in people  who view the case a particular way [their way].... After studying the  information obtained from the mock jurors, we prepare questionnaires for  the real prospective jurors.... We can't ask them in advance how they would  decide the case [but presumably would if they could], but if we know how  others with similar traits would have decided it, we can make an educated  guess [that will help us stack the jury in favor of our  client]&quot;<br />Although it's enough to turn a fair-minded citizen's  stomach, the author's descriptions of the shenanigans that go into jury  selection are among the book's most informative aspects.  If you ever  wanted to know how to get selected for a jury - or how to get kicked off of  one - this book will be an invaluable resource.<br />There is no new  information in the book.  It's mostly how to use common sense, mixed up  with lots of rules based on stereotypes and things your mother might have  told you. In fact, the author's even solicited anecdotal stories about how  to read people.  They suggest a future book with all your insightful  comments &quot;see your story in print.&quot;  So look for their future  edition, or read the cover of supermarket tabloids (whichever comes  first).<br />I found the blunt description of stereotypes (including racial  and ethnic stereotypes) rather interesting, especially in the context of  the O. J. Simpson trial.  Here we have the defense explaining how they used  stereotypes to select a jury that then disregarded the material facts in  the case and rendered a verdict of not guilty because of defense hype about  stereotypes used by the police. <br />The book also offers lots of examples  illustrating problems in cognitive reasoning.  Jo-Ellan is obviously proud  of her ability to pick the right jurors for the case.  In doing so,  however, she seems to overlook almost completely the roll that material  facts have (or should have) in court cases.  In her mind, it seems, every  time a case is won it's because she picked the right jurors.  In fact, she  makes apoint of saying that the reason she knows that her method of  reading people works is because her cases have all been so successful.   What's she's missing, of course, is any information about how the juries  would have voted if all the people she dismissed based on stereotyping had  been allowed to remain on the jury.  This is classic logical dissonance.   If you are interested in this sort of fallacious reasoning I suggest  &quot;How we know what isn't so,&quot; by Gilovich.  <br />Throughout the book  Jo-Ellan applies her distinctly cosmopolitan standard to reading people.   For her the most important clues are shinny shoes, a primed haircut,  pressed pants, and how you behave at dinner parties.  Even the tissue you  keep around the house says something of your character - more sensitive  people use softer tissue, you know. <br />As you may have guessed, I don't  think much of the book.  <br />Duwayne Anderson Saint Helens, Oregon.

US	53038410	R3I80APKHH477J	0691059489	892705601	Towing Icebergs, Falling Dominoes, and Other Adventures in Applied Mathematics	Books	5	54	55	N	N	Adventures in applied mathematics	Mathematics has been called the universal language.  After reading Bank's book you might believe it's so.  Banks takes the reader on a whirlwind tour of mathematical applications to a broad range of every-day events and  phenomena.  In doing so he exposes the reader not only to some fun and  interesting mathematics but also to a better appreciation of analysis and  how broadly it applies to our lives.  <br />As the title says, this is a book  on applied mathematics.  To read and enjoy it you need to understand basic  integral calculus and solutions to differential equations.  There's also a  smattering of algebra, trigonometry, and geometry.  <br />One of the first  things I noticed about the book is the breadth and scope of the topics.   Banks does not live in a single corner of the world, but has obviously  striven to sample a wide variety of mathematical applications in some  remote corners of the world.  There is, as the cover suggests, a  mathematical treatment of towing icebergs, complete with cost and  structural engineering analysis.  This happens relatively close to the  beginning of the book.  Nearer the end of the book Banks has a chapter  devoted to the science of waves in falling dominoes.  In between is a wide  selection of other topics, including quite a bit on exponential growth,  both limited and unlimited, and its applications to lots of natural systems  including alligator eggs, GNP, and deficit spending.  <br />Banks does more  than simply describe physical problems and write down their differential  equations.  He also does a good job of explaining the phenomena.  Nor do  integrals and differential equations describe all the problems.  A  significant portion of the book, for example, is devoted to statistics and  related things like curve fitting.  <br />And he does not forget the social  sciences, either.  Banks touches on such subjects as how to start a  football game, a better way to score the Olympics, how to calculate the  economic energy of a nation, and how to reduce the population.  I found  these subjects quite interesting, though I think the linear curve fit he  used in the section on scoring the Olympics stretches my imagination.  [To  me, the data look pretty random.  Indeed, the correlation coefficient is  only slightly more than 0.5 (see figure 8.1 and correlation coefficient  after equation (8.1)).  Still, Banks (as if driven by a preconceived  objective) presses on and applies a linear regression from which he later  derives key results for his scoring method.]<br />For the sports-minded among  you Banks offers lots of examples of applied mathematics in the fields (pun  intended) of baseball, golf, track, basketball, jumping rope, ski jumping,  and the shot put.  For example, did you know that a child jumping rope is  swinging a curve called a troposkein?  Furthermore, the troposkein is  useful in vertical-axis wind turbines because the shape eliminates  compression and bending forces.  So the next time you see the kids jumping  rope, tell them how to chant &quot;one troposkein, two troposkein ...&quot;  instead.  It will be an opportunity to teach them some mathematics as well  as really impress their teachers.<br />Most of the sports examples involve  problems with air.  Air causes drag, which is usually a problem to be  fought in sports, but it also causes lift, which can be either a problem  (as in the hook and slice in your game of golf) or an advantage (as in your  curve or knuckle ball in baseball).   I particularly enjoyed the discussion  of aerodynamics and its application to ski jumping.  Seriously, this is one  book you want to read before the next Olympics.  <br />There are also brief  forays into architecture, meteorites, and wave phenomena.  Do you know why  the Eiffel Tower looks the way it does?   How about the Gateway arch in  Saint Louis?  If not, you can find the answers in chapter 13.   Want to  know when to run for cover if a large meteor is heading our way?  Then readchapters 4 and 5.  Ever wonder why a tsunami causes widespread destruction  on land but does not seem to be even noticed by ships at sea?  Then you  won't want to miss chapter 21.<br />The constant theme throughout this book  (though Banks never states it explicitly) is that mathematics is the  universal language.  Through its magic we understand and control our world.   <br />In addition to being a great book for subject and clarity, the book  also has a nice presentation.  The equations are all numbered.  Failure to  number equations was a complaint I had about &quot;The Story of root minus  one,&quot; by Paul J. Nahin (Nahin, by the way, is quoted on the back  cover).  Banks is also a walking treasure chest of other references.  If  any of the subjects he touches upon interest you, then run (don't walk) to  the bibliography.  You will find lots of references there for further  (usually more detailed) discussions and treatments of the subjects Bank's  covers.  The book is also pretty accurate.  I found only minor  typographical errors like the missing equal sign in equation (19.6) and a  typo on table 20.2.  <br />Another thing I liked about the book is the way  Banks leaves lots of the derivations to the reader.  Sometimes these  derivations involve a page or two of scribbles (like the one for equation  17.22).  The book also has problems and suggested research topics for  students.  This would be a great idea book for students in mathematics,  physics, and engineering.    About the only complaint I have is that the  book's index is miserly.  Use lots of yellow markers, dog-ear the pages,  and you may want to have some sticky notes around as well when you read  it.<br />So, if you love mathematics and especially applied mathematics I  highly recommend this book.  I guarantee you will enjoy it.<br />Duwayne  Anderson Saint Helens November 23, 1999	1999-11-23
US	53038410	R2OIRSJBK1LPF0	0345426339	256202976	The Measure of a Mountain: Beauty and Terror on Mount Rainier	Books	4	10	11	N	N	A good story	Bruce Barcott writes as if you were in the room speaking with him.  His style is friendly, to the point (often blunt) descriptive and frequently flowery.  He uses such descriptive phrases that I was often left rolling on  the floor, tears of laughter flowing from my eyes.   <br />It's hard to  categorize this book.  It's not really about climbing mountains, though  there is plenty of that.  It's not really about geology, though there is  plenty of that as well.  It's not about ecology, though ecologists will  certainly connect with Barcott, and it's not really about history, even  though there are lots of interesting historical tidbits sprinkled  throughout the book.  The book is sort of a mish mash of all these subjects  that Barcott ultimately ties in with the mountain that defines Washington  State, and Seattle in particular: Rainier.<br />It's hard to say what part of  the book I enjoyed the most.  I really enjoyed the stories about the  mountain's &quot;real&quot; name.  Even though I grew up in Federal Way,  Washington I never knew about the battle waged by Tacoma in trying to  rename Rainier with it's original (or at least one of them) Indian name.   There are other interesting historical footnotes like the military plane  carrying marines home for the Christmas holidays that slammed into the  mountain.  And, of course, there are stories about early climbers like  Muir.  <br />Barcott describes lots of his hikes around Rainier, particularly  the wonderland trail, and he ends the book with an account of his climb to  the summit.  As it turned out, I had climbed Rainier in June of the same  year Barcott climbed it (he climbed in July) and so it was interesting  comparing my recollection of the trip with his.<br />Barcott tries hard not to  come across as the typical macho, climb-or-die mountaineer.  In fact, he  has some rather harsh words to say about some of the people who climb -  offering physiological analysis that, although insightful and probably  closeto the mark, is sometimes pretty insulting.  But that's Barcott's  style - to the point with no BS.  I like it.<br />The author presents lots of  stuff in the book as factual, but there are no footnotes or chapter  endnotes.  Consequently, at first I was a little skeptical about how much  of the book (especially what appeared to be anecdotal) is just fabricated  for its story-telling value.  Upon reaching the end of the book, however, I  had to conclude that Barcott has probably done his homework and research  pretty thoroughly.  There is a long list of references (roughly 100) with  descriptions about many.  Some of the references look pretty good, and I'm  probably going to get one or two of them for further reading.  The book  also has a complete index, which is something the forgetful among us always  appreciate.<br />Overall this is a fine book.  It's enjoyable, interesting,  sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes reflective, but always engaging.   I read the entire book - all 250 pages - in just a few days.  It's a great  companion for those cold rainy Northwest nights when there's a log in the  fireplace.<br />Duwayne Anderson Saint Helens, Oregon.  November 18, 1999	1999-11-18
US	53038410	R238FMR4Q0NMXW	0691057753	199174249	Is the Temperature Rising? The Uncertain Science of Global Warming	Books	4	22	23	N	N	It's really about climate	It's hard to imagine a more relevant, timely, and important book for our day than Philander's book on global warming.  Though I say the book is about global warming, I really must elaborate.  You see, this is really a book on earth's climate.  Global warming is just a part of the book - a  relatively short chapter at the end.  The rest of the book consists of  background information about climate that enables the reader to understand  (at least in concept) the scientific arguments and issues related to global  warming.  Whether you believe that human intervention in the composition of  the atmosphere will alter earth's climate or not (and I'm personally hoping  you have the sense to do so) this is a first-rate book on climate issues in  general.  <br />The book is broken into three &quot;parts.&quot;  The first  part is really just an introduction and discusses things at a pretty high  level.  The second part deals with weather (variations in day to day  atmospheric conditions).  There is an introduction to ideas related to  absorption and radiation of heat, atmospheric pressure and temperature  gradients (what causes them), the hydrological cycle, winds, and how the  ocean and atmosphere couple together. <br />I particularly found the  discussion about the ocean currents interesting.  There is an unusually  good discussion of El Nino and how it forms.  There is also some good  discussion about why ice ages have appeared over the earth's history.  [For  a more directed discussion about ice ages, I suggest &quot;Ice Ages,  Solving the mystery,&quot; by John Imbrie and Katherine Palmer Imbrie.   <br />The main text of the book is non-mathematical and has plenty of diagrams  and illustrations to help convey concepts.  The book also comes equipped  with 13 appendixes that go into more quantitative detail.  These appendixes  use numerous equations, but require no skills in mathematics beyond  high-school trigonometry and algebra.  [For a more rigorous and advanced  textI suggest &quot;The physics of atmospheres,&quot; by John T.  Houghton.&quot;]<br />The last (third) part of the book gets down to business  regarding the subject of global warming.  It also discusses the ozone hole  and provides an illuminating discussion about why it appears over the  southern polar cap.<br />I thought that one major piece of missing information  is a breakdown by country and source of the types of pollution that can  lead to global warming.  It would be nice, for example, to see a chart that  shows how much each country contributes, the individual contributions in  each country, and the types of fuels that are the most damaging.  [This  information is available from sources in the bibliography, however.]  <br />If  I could summarize the author's main premise it would be this: The  atmosphere is an incredibly complicated system that illustrates  sometimes-chaotic behavior.  Globally it is probably stable - we most  likely will not cause runaway global warming and life will survive.   Locally, however, the weather can and does behave chaotically.  We have the  power to make our atmosphere more hazardous for our species.  We are taking  a terrible gamble in modifying several greenhouse gases, not by factors of  a few percent, but by hundreds of percent.  <br />The fact there is  uncertainty in the exact final outcome is not the point.  The point is we  are gambling with the only atmosphere we have, and the results, if we  loose, could be dire.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels an  obligation to be more informed about what is, perhaps, the most important  environmental issue of the day.   <br />Duwayne Anderson Saint Helens, Oregon  October 12, 1999	1999-10-12
US	53038410	RZGPILK0TSYH1	0123951704	866143678	Optical Fiber Telecommunications IIIA, Volume 3A (Optics and Photonics)	Books	5	19	19	N	N	A comprehensive review	Optical Fiber Telecommunications III is designed for anyone engaged in engineering work related to the fiber-optics telecommunications industry.   There seems to be little doubt about the revolutionary path leading to full  deployment of fiber in the telecommunications backbone network, or the  trends moving fiber closer to and closer to end users.  Yet, while this  continual deepening of fiber into the national network progresses steadily,  a new revolution has overtaken photonics in the backbone: dense  wavelength-division multiplexing, or DWDM.  DWDM, perhaps more than any  other technology, is the reason that the third edition of this seminal work  is needed today.  It's not too surprising, then, that most of the third  edition is directly or indirectly related to design concerns related to  DWDM.<br />This text is best described as an engineer's desk reference.  The  scope is large, necessitating breaking the book into two volumes.  Volume  III A deals mostly with system issues and concerns, delving into more  esoteric component issues primarily to illustrate the wider network  implications.  Volume III B deals more with specific component design  issues, such as sources, detectors, and erbium-doped fiber amplifiers  (EDFAs).  <br />As a desk reference, there are few derivations of equations  from first principles.  Perhaps the closest derivation is that of the  nonlinear Schrodinger equation in chapter 12 on soliton transmission.  Even  here, however, the derivation is sketchy at best.  For the most part the  book simply places the equations at the reader's disposal.  I found most of  the equations are explained well, and most of the chapter authors included  numeric examples, charts, and graphs.  This helps immensely in  understanding the implications of the many equations presented throughout  the text.  For those interested in derivations, each chapter comes with  extensive endnotes so that anyone interested in reviewing the original work  can easily do so.<br />One problem with the text revolves around  definitions of mathematical variables and constants.  Though they are all  defined as introduced to the reader, there is no glossary of these terms.   I constantly found myself writing in the books margins little notes like  &quot;alpha is the total loss coefficient, first used in equation x on page  y.&quot;  Since different authors write each chapter in the book, it may  not be practical to have a glossary of terms for the entire volume - usage  will probably overlap.  Still, it would be nice had the editors suggested  that each chapter have a glossary of mathematical variables.  It would make  the book far more practical and useful as a desk reference.  On a more  positive note, however, the book does contain a detailed and useful index.  <br />Even without derivations, the book contains a plethora of equations and  charts to satisfy the needs of most quantitatively oriented engineers.   It's a good introductory book for those with a modest background in optical  telecommunications technology.  It's also a useful book for those more  familiar with the technology, but needing a handy reference source with  most of the pertinent information conveniently bound between two covers.   Volume A contains 15 chapters in roughly 600 pages.   Volume B is slightly  smaller, having 10 chapters in roughly 500 pages. <br />For me, the two most  interesting and useful sections of the book were chapter 8, &quot;Fiber  nonlinearities and their impact on transmission systems,&quot; and chapter  12, &quot;Solitons in high bit-rate, long-distance transmissions.&quot;   Chapter 12 is probably one of the best written.  Although the subject  matter is among the most difficult covered in the book,  L. F. Mollenauer,  J.P. Gordon, and P. V. Mamyshev have done a remarkable job of explaining  solitions in a quantitative, accurate, yet clear and concise manner.<br />The  first chapter in the book, a brief overview by Ivan P. Kaminow, provides  some interesting historical insights and background, but has relatively  little pertinent information for the design engineer.  The second chapter  deals at a high level with SONET and ATM technologies, explaining the  requirements that led to the development of these standards and some of  their topologies such as chains and self-healing rings.  Chapter 3 deals  with coding and error correction in optical fiber.  This chapter was  interesting in its use of fundamental physics (such as quantum noise) to  examine the need for coding.<br />The next chapters move from coding and  protocol to issues in the physical layer.  Chapter 6 deals with  polarization effects, the origin of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and  how to measure PMD.  On a similar theme, chapter 7 deals with the subject  of chromatic dispersion and, perhaps more importantly, the subject of  dispersion compensation.  One of the interesting facts about DWDM is that  elimination of dispersion is no longer a design goal, as it is with  single-wavelength transmission systems.  In DWDM systems the designer wants  just the right amount of dispersion - not too much, and not too little.   There are even situations in which the dispersion map matters - in other  words, you cannot always count on being able to place large bulk amounts of  compensating dispersion just in front of the optical receiver.  Sometimes  you need to distribute it along the fiber's length.<br />Two chapters, 9 and  10, deal with the specific design concerns of terrestrial and undersea  lightwave systems, while chapter 14 deals with the substantial concerns of  analog video transmission over optical fibers.  Chapter 11 deals with  advances in high bit-rate transmission systems (this chapter tends to be  somewhat dated, and the situation will only get worse with passing time).   Chapter 13 surveys the types of fiber architectures in current and possibly  future networks.  Finally, Ivan P. Kaminow finishes the book with a chapter  onadvanced multi-access lightwave networks, which is primarily the  switched DWDM network (another chapter subject to dating). <br />This is an  extremely valuable book for anyone involved in Photonics in the  telecommunications network.  I highly recommend it.  Whether you read it  cover to cover, or simply keep it handy as a desk reference, I'm sure you  will find it well worth the cover price.	1999-10-08
US	53038410	R68RKH768K6F8	0062515861	193492666	Weaving the Web : The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its Inventor	Books	3	11	11	N	N	A mixed bag	I have mixed feelings about this book.  On the one hand, Berners-Lee has written a book that not only describes the invention and evolution of the Web, but also inspires commitment to high principles and deep  introspection.  Berners-Lee is clearly an intellect of the highest caliber,  and his commitment to democratic principles in developing the Web is, to  me, profoundly admirable.  On the other hand, the author seems to labor  under the common curse of most software engineers - an inability to clearly  communicate ideas and concepts to the non-specialist.  Though he tries in  words to communicate these concepts, I believe that, overall, his attempt  fails unless the reader first has some exposure to, and familiarity with  the world-wide Web - an unacceptable pre-requisite for a book directed at  the non-specialist.<br />The really unfortunate thing about this is that it  does not need to be so.  For example, the book has no figures and no tables  (though it does have a glossary of the hundreds of acronyms used and a good  index).  A few well-designed figures and summary tables would help a great  deal to unify concepts that are just plain fuzzy and awkward when described  with words alone.  If you've ever seen a Web site and hypertext you can  pretty well follow along with the written descriptions, but how much more  helpful it would have been to have a few (color) pictures illustrating what  a well-constructed Web site with hyper text looks like.  <br />The book does  have its fine points.  It is a first-hand look at how the Web came into  existence, and how it is continuing to evolve today.  It also explains  efforts to make the Web more valuable.  For example, my experience with the  Web indicates that it has not only enabled the exchange of accurate,  timely, and useful information, but also the dissemination of ignorance,  intolerance, and stupidity.  Not only has it facilitated these things, it  has made it possible for them to &quot;dress up&quot; and lookas  legitimate as the best peer-review science journal.  The unfortunate fact  is that anyone with a few thousand dollars and the proper disposition can  setup a Web site and say anything they want.  This certainly facilitates  democratic principles, and I'm not suggesting a central authority that  practices censorship by any means, but the unfortunate fact is that it  results in an information structure where virtually everything is suspect.   <br />Berners-Lee hints at solutions to this problem through what he calls a  &quot;Web of Trust&quot; in which people establish associations on the Web  much as they do in real life, where certain associations bring trust, while  others bring suspicion.  For example, when I pick up a technical book by  Wylie, I tend to trust the content because of my experience with other  books by this publisher.  I make similar associations with some authors,  journals, newsmagazines, etc.  Development of processes and standards to  support this &quot;Web of Trust&quot; will go a long way toward improving  the utility of the worldwide Web.<br />Anther problem I've found with the Web  is that there are no acceptable search engines.  Current search engines  (including the butler) are clumsy things that act like they are trying to  understand what you are asking for, but really haven't a clue.  Work in  progress should enable search engines to actually act intelligently, and  provide far greater utility.  The author describes some of the  possibilities in this arena as well, and sheds some light on what we might  expect to see in the future.<br />Every politician involved in writing  legislation associated with the Web should read this book if, for no other  reason, than to understand the consequences of attempts to censor  information.  Burners-Lee offers several anecdotal stories that illustrate  the complexity of the Web and how attempts to censor can have unintended  consequences.  The one I like best regards a Christian fundamentalist group  that lobbied for tools that would allow them and others to block sites they  considered to be pornographic.  As it turned out, other groups had used  similar tools to block the fundamentalists' Web site because they  considered it to be unacceptable to children owning to the white  supremacist and anti-gay propaganda carried there.  The example hit home  with two important facts about censorship and the Web: First, no single  person can decide for everyone what is unacceptable and offensive - big  brother censorship is totally unacceptable.   Second, the technical tools  exist for people to censor themselves and/or their children by blocking  certain sites.  What we as a society should do, therefore, is to maintain  our commitment to democratic principles and freedom of expression while  providing the proper technical tools to ensure that parents and individuals  continue to have control over what and whom they wish to associate.<br />There  is also a good discussion about issues relating to privacy.  Clearly, the  Europeans are far ahead of Americans in this area.  It seems odd that so  many Americans seem oblivious and unconcerned about personal information  being acquired about them over the Internet, and that our government has  done so little to protect personal privacy.<br />One unifying theme comes  through this book - the Web is not a &quot;thing,&quot; it is a space.   This space is not controlled by a central authority, but is built upon the  principles of individual freedom of expression.  Berners-Lee's personal  commitment to these ideals is the real reason the Web exists today.	1999-10-01
US	53038410	R3W4DBYWV1NOHW	0691027951	160496387	An Imaginary Tale: The Story of [the square root of minus one]	Books	5	110	114	N	N	A great book, chock full of equations	When I first took a copy of Nahin's book off the shelf, I expected a history book operating under the usual rules that seem to dominate easy reading books on science today - no equations.  What I found instead was an  unexpected surprise that immediately cemented my decision to purchase the  book - it is chuck full of equations.  But then, how do you write a book  about mathematics without using equations?  I'm glad that for this one, at  least, the publishers listened to reason.<br />Of course, the book isn't all  equations.  There is some downright interesting history in it as well.  For  the most part, however, this is a book that illustrates the equations (or  at least their modern counter parts) that led mathematicians to develop the  concept of the square root of a negative number, eventually leading to the  branch of mathematics we call today complex analysis.  Having said that, I  should point out that this is not a mathematics book on complex analysis  [for that, a better choice is &quot;Complex Variables,&quot; by Mark J.  Ablowitz and Athanassios S. Fokas, Cambridge University Press, 1997].  The  author does not develop theorems or proofs, and many of the demonstrations  stretch the notion of mathematical proofs - but they are not intended to be  mathematical proofs at all, but just that - demonstrations.  Think of this  book as a mathematicians leisurely romp through the mathematical history of  root negative one, with an average of at least two or three equations on  every page.  The mathematics isn't advanced by any means.  If you are  reasonably grounded in algebra, geometry, trigonometry (and lots of it),  and a little calculus (including a few differential equations) you should  have no trouble at all.  Plan on working through the equations, though,  step by step.  You won't want to miss a single &quot;aaaahhh.&quot;<br />I  really have only two complaints about Nahin's book, both of which are  really pretty minor.  The first complaint is that noneof the equations are  numbered.  This means the author is constantly saying things like &quot;now  go back to the first equation in the last section and notice ....&quot;  I  found this sometimes hard to follow, and would have appreciated a few key  equations having numbers (and a box) associated with them.  Another  complaint is that the book has some typographical errors in some of the  equations that can sometimes interfere with following the  derivations.<br />Don't misunderstand, though.  This is one of the best  leisure books on mathematics I've read in a long time.  The author writes  clearly, has an incredible breadth of knowledge, and presents some really  beautiful mathematics.  It was a real let down when I finally finished, and  realized how tough it was going to be finding another book to which I would  look with such yearning at the end of the day for a relaxing evening of  intellectual entertainment.<br />The book begins with the story of cubics, and  how their solutions involved the square root of negative numbers.  From  there the book moves toward early work, or the &quot;first try&quot; at  understanding complex numbers.  There is some interesting history about  Rene Descartes and John Wallis, as well as stories about Casper Wessel,  Gauss, Argand, Warren, Mourey, and, of course, De Moivre.<br />The books first  three chapters have the most history.  The last four chapters offer more  examples of how complex analysis has played a pivotal role in science and  technology.  The author offers some interesting uses of complex analysis in  the solving of integrals, trigonometric identities, Kepler's laws of  satellite orbits, and, of course, circuit analysis in electrical  engineering.<br />My favorite chapter by far is chapter six, titled  &quot;wizard mathematics.&quot;  It seems there was a &quot;aaaahhh&quot;  on at least every other page.  This chapter is devoted to illuminating some  of the mathematical prowess of wizards such as Euler, Bernoulli,Fagnano,  Cotes, Riemann, and Schellback.  Plan on using up at least one highlighter  on this chapter alone.<br />Nahin ends with a chapter on complex analysis in  the nineteenth century, and Cauchy's integral formulas (there is also a  brief discussion and derivation of Green's theorem).  Then, as with the  other chapters, Nahin gives lots of examples of what you can do with these  mathematical tools, and where they can take you.<br />Easily one of the best  books I've ever read.  If you love mathematics, your library really cannot  be considered complete unless this book, tattered and worn with lots of  dog-eared pages and scribbles all over the margins, is on the  shelf.<br />Duwayne Anderson September 22, 1999	1999-09-22
US	53038410	R2SH1AXJU9B2O	0963473263	473424514	Quest for the Gold Plates	Books	5	205	232	N	N	A tragedy of truth found and rejected	In an ideal world you'd expect that any subject could be coolly and dispassionately examined and judged according to the facts.  We don't live in such a world, though, and this is abundantly clear upon reading Stan  Larson's book &quot;Quest for the Gold Plates.&quot;<br />This is a book about  one man's search for truth.  Thomas Stuart Ferguson was a staunch Mormon  with a dream to show to the world that Mormonism is true, and that the Book  of Mormon is literally the history of a vast ancient Amerindian  civilization.  According to the Book of Mormon there were three migrations  from the Old World to the New.  The first migration happened sometime  around the fabled tower of Babel described in the Old Testament.  The  second two migrations happened within a few years of each other, and  involved Hebrew migrations from the area around Jerusalem roughly 600 BCE.  <br />According to the Book of Mormon, the people involved in these migrations  established huge civilizations that stretched from sea to sea.  They wrote  extensively using Hebrew and Egyptian, domesticated horses and cattle,  cultivated many Old World plants, traveled in chariots, and smelted many  metals, including iron and steel.<br />The Book of Mormon, ostensibly written  by these civilizations, came to us from the prophet Joseph Smith, who  founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons).  Not too  surprisingly, however, the golden plates are not available for scientific  examination - the same angle who gave them to Joseph for  &quot;translation&quot; took them back when the book was complete.  Thus  giving us the title of Larson's book.<br />The Book of Mormon is so  descriptive and unambiguous about the extent and type of ancient Amerindian  civilizations it describes that it practically screams for corroborating  archaeological evidence to support its assertions.  As a young man,  Ferguson felt foreordained as the person responsible for finding this  archaeological information and bringing it to the world - proving Mormonism  is true and opening the floodgates for converts into Joseph Smith's  religion.<br />Ferguson was unrelenting, and he moved in high circles within  the Mormon Church.  He co-authored &quot;Ancient American and the Book of  Mormon&quot; with Milton R. Hunter (a General Authority in the Mormon  Church) and on October 1952 Ferguson organized the New World Archaeological  Foundation (NWAF) in California.  Early on NWAF performed some valuable  archaeological research, and employed some eminent non-Mormon scientists.   This was part of Ferguson's plan, as he intended the archaeological  evidence for the Book of Mormon to be of the highest academic quality.   Eventually, however, the Mormon Church lost its enthusiasm for funding a  strictly academic organization, especially as the promised evidence for the  Book of Mormon failed year after year to appear.  In 1960 the First  Presidency of the LDS Church announced that NWAF would be reorganized, and  its continued support from the LDS Church would come through church-owned  BYU with Howard W. Hunter, an apostle of the Mormon Church, appointed as  chairman in January 1961, and Ferguson as secretary.<br />Ferguson began his  quest with rhetoric of the highest moral caliber.  He described his quest  as a search for truth.  He was firm in his conviction that through his work  the latter-day prophet Joseph Smith would be vindicated at last, and all  the world compelled to admit that the Book of Mormon was literal history,  and by implication that Mormonism was God's restored church on earth.  As  the years passed, however, and the expected evidence stubbornly refused to  materialize, Ferguson became less brash.  Eventually he came to recognize  that the archaeological evidence he looked for did not exist.  In 1993  Michael D. Coe, professor of anthropology at Yale University, summarized  the situation by saying:<br />&quot;I have seen no archaeological evidence  before or since that [1973] date which would convince me that it [the Book  of Mormon] is anything but a fanciful creation by an unusually gifted  individual living in upstate New York in the early nineteenth  century.&quot;  [page 70].<br />Though Ferguson began his quest as a quest for  truth, once he found the truth he quickly abandoned his earlier plans to  disseminate it.  Larson shows clearly through letters and documented  conversations that Ferguson eventually reached the same conclusion as Coe.   Yet while the young Ferguson expected people in other religions to abandon  their faith for the light and truth of Mormonism, the old Ferguson proved  too inadequate to show the same conviction to truth.  Though he believed  the Book of Mormon is fiction, Ferguson simply found it impossible to let  go the social fabric of his Mormon upbringing.  He described the Mormon  Church as a great fraternity, and a worthwhile organization in its own  right.  He seemed to find a measure of smugness in knowing that it is all a  hoax, but not wanting to spoil the party for all the common people who find  Mormonism so important in their lives.<br />In this regard I find myself  completely at odds with Larson's closing comment:<br /> &quot;His [Ferguson's]  legacy is a commitment to the search for truth.&quot;  <br />No statement  could be more inaccurate.  In the end, Ferguson showed that his commitment  is to fraternity and brotherhood.  He saw the truth, but found himself  unable to proclaim it.  Ferguson is simply another of a long list of men  who had the opportunity to speak out and be heard - who could have made a  difference by standing up for truth, but decided instead to keep a secret  rather than upset his life and disillusion the common folk.  For me,  Ferguson represents a tragedy.  <br />Clearly written and immaculately  referenced, Stan Larson's book is essential for anyone concerned with the  reality of whether or not the Book of Mormon is true.  It represents the  story of one man's search for truth, and tragic failure to embrace it.   Perhaps some good can yet come, however, if Larson's book can inspire  other's to accept the truth Ferguson discovered, and let commitment to  truth overcome commitment to fraternity.  <br />Duwayne Anderson August 25,  1999	1999-08-25
US	53038410	R3MRIE31EXD1Q1	0890061505	473183673	Modern Spectrum Analyzer: Theory and Applications	Books	5	20	20	N	N	A nice primer	This book is currently out of print, and much of the specific product-oriented discussions are now obsolete (my copy has a 1984 copyright).  Still, this is an excellent little book with lots of  information that is time invariant.  I found it worth while, and believe it  deserves a spot in any RF engineer's library.<br />Throughout the book the  author uses clear and intuitive examples and diagrams to illustrate  principles.  The first chapter is a basic overview describing how to  construct a spectrum analyzer.  The author gives brief examples of  tuned-filter, filter bank, and swept-signal spectrum analyzers as well as  those based on ffts applied to time-domain waveforms.<br />Chapter two is a  review of the mathematics related to transforms connecting the time and  frequency domains.  This chapter has a nice, intuitive section on  orthogonal functions that leads naturally to the subject of Fourier  transforms and the fft algorithm.  Some of the explanations are a little  elementary, but I found the intuitive descriptions interesting. <br />Chapter  three is devoted exclusively to Fourier analysis.  Engelson presents the  Fourier series and applications in a characteristically simple and  straightforward manner.  He touches upon a number of interesting subjects  related to Fourier analysis such as superposition and the Gibbs phenomenon.   After describing continuous and discrete transforms, Engelson spends  considerable time trying to (in his words) &quot;reconcile theory and  measurement.&quot;  I found Engelson's practical, down-to-earth  explanations useful.  This chapter also has a table of time and frequency  relationships that are sure to be referenced regularly.  Typographical  errors are relatively rare in this book, though on page 61 there is some  confusion by misnumbered equations.<br />The book spends considerable time on  modulation theory, describing AM and FM modulation techniques and  measurement methods.  There is lots of useful information regarding  modulation techniques in chapters 4 (general information), 7 (AM  modulation), and 8 (FM modulation).  The only real complaint I have about  these chapters is that the reproductions of spectrum analyzer front-panel  displays are often hard to read and interpret.  Also, I would have placed  chapters 4, 7, and 8 consecutively instead of splitting them up with  chapters 5 and 6.<br />Chapter 5 describes the sweeping signal spectrum  analyzer, which is the basis for most of the book's discussion and  examples.  Chapter 6 is especially practical in that it deals with typical  measurement problems.  If you use a spectrum analyzer in your work, you  will not want to miss chapter 6.<br />The book ends with a chapter on pulses.   This chapter covers lots of topics, including how the frequency domain  changes with minor changes in pulse shape, the differences in the single  pules and repeated pulse spectra, and the effects of FM.  As in other  chapters, Engelson brings the reader back to earth with repeated examples  correlating the mathematical theory with actual measurements.<br />There is a  short chapter at the end dealing with &quot;miscellaneous&quot; stuff.   Engelson packs quit a bit into that chapter, and some of it is necessarily  brief and truncated.  The book ends with a couple of appendixes, some of  which seem a bit elementary, but others should make useful reference  material.<br />Overall, this is a nice little book.  It's not that long - less  than 250 pages.  It has lots of practical information, though, and plenty  of time-invariant mathematical background as well.  The book has a good  index, as well as questions at the end of each chapter for testing one's  skill in mastering the information.  Overall, I really enjoyed this book.   If you have a chance to pick it up, and if your interest is electrical  spectrum analysis, I recommend it.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1999-06-15
US	53038410	RX80MPAUZPOIC	0716727250	177421894	The Quark and the Jaguar: Adventures in the Simple and the Complex	Books	5	69	76	N	N	A little bit of everything	How do you file a book like &quot;The Quark and the Jaguar?&quot;  I could file it with books discussing quantum physics.  That would certainly be appropriate.  Then, again, I could file it with books on evolution.  That  would be equally appropriate.  But then I might decide to file it in the  section on public policy toward the environment, and environmental  protection.  Certainly, that is an appropriate place for this book.  But  wait.  It also belongs in the section dealing with artificial intelligence  and complex adaptive systems.  So, where would you put it?  I'm still not  sure.<br />Murray Gell-Mann's &quot;The Quark and the Jaguar&quot; takes us on  a whirlwind tour from the &quot;simple&quot; construct of quantum physics  to the complex adaptive system in a coat of spots moving stealthily through  the forest in search of game.  Through all this, Gell-Mann ties the entire  tapestry into the unifying concepts of complex adaptive systems leaving the  reader in awe at the wonder and complexity that arises from the natural  evolutionary processes governing the universe in which we live.<br />The book  is organized in four parts.  The first is a general-purpose section that  discusses everything from information theory to the scientific method and  the power of scientific theories.  It's always a pleasure to read a  description of science and the scientific method from a leading scientist  such as Gell-Mann.  The sections dealing with falsifiability, selection  pressure on the scientific enterprise, unifying characteristics of  scientific theories, and the power of theory give a clear and illuminating  explanation of the essence of science.<br />The second part of the book deals  with quantum physics.  Here you will find Gell-Mann's own story about the  (theoretical) discovery of the quark and how it fits into the standard  model.  Gell-Mann's discussion about the standard model is among the  clearest I've seen for the general reader.  I found his explanationof all  the so-called quantum paradoxes especially well done.  From the standard  model Gell-Mann explains some of the ideas within superstring theory and  the hope that this may provide the unification of physics that has been  anticipated for so long.<br />I always hesitate to differ with anyone of  Gell-Mann's stature.  Especially in public.  It invariably leads to  embarrassment.  Still, I'm just as loath to read a book and find myself in  complete agreement with all its points.  On the subject of complexity I  found myself out of sorts with the trend followed by Gell-Mann.  He begins  by describing complexity as algorithmic complexity.   This is essentially  the length of the shortest binary code that can describe the phenomena.   Gell-Mann then points out some rather obvious deficiencies with this  definition.  For example, it is a maximum for a completely random string of  bits, yet we don't typically associate complexity with randomness.  From  there Gell-Mann takes us to something he calls effective complexity.  Yet  Gell-Mann laments that this still seems inadequate because it would use the  genomes of living things to assess their effective complexity, yet we know  (or do we?) that humans are far more complex than apes, even though we  share well over 90% of our genetic code.  <br />This apparent desire leads  eventually to something Gell-Mann calls &quot;potential complexity.&quot;   Now, I cannot argue specifically against these definitions.  They seem  perfectly intuitive and obvious.  Still, I cannot shake the feeling that  I'm seeing the same process that led scientists in the 19'Th century to  define characteristics for the human skull that led to conclusions that  whites were more intelligent than blacks.  The entire scheme was ultimately  based on subconsciously working toward a desired conclusion by manipulating  definitions.  <br />Are we more complex than apes?  I'm not so sure.   Especially when one considers the next effect of humanity on theearth.   True, for what it's worth we have an extensive and (is it really?) complex  culture.  Then again, we are the cause of the greatest mass extinction  since the K/T boundary.  If you add it all up, I wonder if we really are  responsible for more complexity than random destruction.<br />Sections three  and four differ fundamentally from the first two parts.  The first two  parts deal with what Gell-Mann would call simple systems.  Things like  quantum physics and the general theory of relativity.  The really  complicated stuff is in biology.  Part three deals with that and more,  including general discussions about how complex adaptive systems learn.  I  found the part on creative learning especially interesting.  This section  purports to explain how to enhance one's ability to think creatively.  The  section is only ½ page long.  Interestingly, creative thinking correlates  with what often appears to be random thought processes.  I couldn't help  wondering about the conclusions regarding algebraic complexity and  randomness.<br />The book ends with section four, which is really Gell-Mann's  views on various social issues, particularly those associated with the  environment.  I could not help wishing, as I read these last few pages,  that our species could not have a few more men like Gell-Mann.  What a  difference it would make if his level of intellect, honesty, compassion,  and logic could be brought to focus on more issues.  It left me with a  renewed determination to follow his lead in doing more to preserve  biodiversity on earth for the earth, and for future generations.<br />If you  find wonder in the world, and excitement in a journey of discovery, then I  recommend Gell-Mann's book wholeheartedly.  <br />Duwayne Anderson	1999-06-15
US	53038410	RCSD3OI2JS481	0387949151	57752620	The Call of Distant Mammoths: Why the Ice Age Mammals Disappeared	Books	5	20	24	N	N	A murder mystery	Peter Ward writes his book, The Call of Distant Mammoths, like a murder mystery (a metaphor he uses several times).  The victims are the large mammals that disappeared after the last ice age.   The perpetrator?  Who  knows?  Peter Ward's thesis fingers early hunters who came across the Asian  land bridge as a major, perhaps the major, cause of extinction. <br />Like any  good mystery book, Ward starts before the beginning by taking the reader on  an imaginary trip in a time machine through past eras, periods and epochs  as he revisits the major extinction events in earth's history and reviews  their causes.  The most recent, and perhaps best-known, extinction event is  that at the K/T boundary that saw the extinction of the dinosaurs.  In all  his examples, Ward makes the point that extinctions are rapid (at least on  geologic time scales) events.  I tend to agree, though I'd probably define  rapid in terms of the speed with which organisms evolve. <br />Ward gives some  good background information regarding general points related to evolution.   I especially enjoyed his clear but brief summary of human evolution, as  well as the evolutionary history of elephants.  With this introduction  (which takes up about 1/3 of the book) Ward begins to make his case by  examining the period of time around the last ice age.  Ward finds more than  coincidence in the emergence of human society and extinction of the large  mammals at the end of the last ice age.  As he puts it:<br /> &quot;The time  of the Ice Age is of utmost importance to humanity, for it is the time of  our origin.  We began this interval as australopithecines, ape-like forms  living and dying among the other wildlife of Africa.  We ended the ice Age,  only 10,000 years ago, as humans, living on every continent except  Antarctica.  For humanity, the Ice Age was the crucible of  evolution.&quot;<br />I remain fascinated by the idea that the ice age may  have somehow precipitated a crucial event in human evolution, and in doing  so led both to our emergence as a species, and to the extinction of many  ice-age mammals.<br />I found chapter 5 particularly interesting.  This  chapter, titled &quot;Wheel of Fortune,&quot; illustrates the problems with  viewing evolution as strictly survival of the fittest, partly because the  terminology is somewhat circular and self-referencing.  Many organisms that  seem perfectly fit for survival end up extinct because of pure, dumb, blind  luck.  Things like errant meteorites and other rapid changes to the  environment make the process of evolution something like a roulette wheel.   From another point of view, what constitutes &quot;fit&quot; today may  constitute &quot;unfit&quot; tomorrow, given significant changes in the  environment.  <br />It's not until the latter sections of the Book that Ward  gets down to business and describes how our species precipitated the  ice-age extinctions.  In one explanation, human-caused fires were a major  contributor.  I must admit, I found this explanation wanting.  Even today  (with billions of our species on the globe and millions of urbanites  seeking outdoor recreation) lightning-caused fires far outnumber those  caused by people.  Perhaps these primitive societies started the fires  deliberately?  At any rate, it seems that climatic changes that led to  drying out, with more dry lightning would precipitate more fires than our  early primitive ancestors would.  But that's just intuition - right?   Perhaps our ancestors were more destructive than I think they were.  What  seems equally hard to accept is that a few million hunters managed to cause  the entire extinction of the mammoths and other large North-American  mammals that went extinct at the end of the last ice age.  <br />Perhaps the  strongest point Ward makes is the correlation between the appearance of  people in other areas (notably Australia) and local extinctions there.  I  found this particularly persuasive.  I must admit to being skeptical about  the proposed reasons, but the fact of a positive correlation cannot be  casually dismissed.  The presence of our species seems to correlate well  with the extinction of lots of species - then and now.  There remain,  however, exceptions to be explained.  After all, our species emerged from  Africa, and Africa today has the world's largest assortment of large  animals.<br />I believe the weakest area of Ward's thesis remains the (nearly)  simultaneous extinction of literally dozens of other large animals at the  same time as the mammoths.  While ancient cultures, armed with obsidian  spears, might have had a penchant for mammoth flesh, and caused their  extinction, would (could) they have been such voracious hunters as to do  the same thing to horses camels, and rhinoceri?  These other species remain  relatively anonymous in Ward's book, and I think the argument Ward makes  would have been far stronger had he proposed how those animals also went  extinct at the hands of primitive hunters.<br />I found Ward's results of  computer simulations, showing that even relatively minor hunting can lead  to extinction in a population that is already under stress, very  interesting.  It wouldn't be the first time our species has caused another  to go extinct.  Indeed many scientists would argue that people are  currently precipitating the largest extinction event since the one that  killed all the dinosaurs.<br />Having read Ward's book was an enriching  experience. For me, this book illustrates the thrill of science.    Unanswered questions and the thrill of the chase are what make science such  a rewarding enterprise.  If natural science is your bailiwick, you'll find  lots to like about The Call of Distant Mammoths.  I highly recommend  it.<br />Duwayne Anderson June 15, 1999	1999-06-15
US	53038410	R3EOVGZHYMGAJG	1560850205	296110647	The Search for Harmony: Essays on Science and Mormonism (Essays on Mormonism Series)	Books	3	10	19	N	N	Should be titled: Mormonism and evolution	The first thing I would change about this book is its title.  It should have been &quot;Essays on Evolution and Mormonism.&quot;  I wouldn't change the subtitle, though.  This book has everything to do with apologetics, and  very little to do with the search for truth.  There is nothing in the book,  for example, about the scientific problems with the Book of Mormon or the  Book of Abraham.  Neither is there any discussion about such things as the  scientific problems associated with Mormonism's belief in a literal,  worldwide flood or the literal tower of Babel.<br />Since there are so many  contributors, it's difficult to assign an overall score to the book.  Some  of the essays are particularly insightful, don't draw unwarranted  conclusions, and provide useful references and historical data.  On the  other hand, It's pretty hard to take some of the essays seriously.  I found  the editor's introduction to be among the most interesting parts of the  book, with some quotations from Mormon leaders, and statistics I've not  seen before.   For the most part I found the editors fairly honest in their  portrayals, with a notable exception.  In the introduction they portray  Ezra Taft Benson as being open minded and embracing of science.  I find  this hard to believe of a man who once said:  <br />&quot;Our families may be  corrupted by worldly trends and teachings unless we know how to use the  book [of Mormon] to expose and combat the falsehoods in socialism, organic  evolution, rationalism, humanism, and so forth.&quot;  (Ezra Taft Benson,  &quot;A Witness and a Warning, page 6.]<br />Another problem I found with the  editors, and with almost all the essays in the book, is a pervasive  tendency for Mormon apologists to define evolution as something it is not.   Instead of using the scientific definition of evolution, they tend to  redefine the subject as something they can believe, and then claim (with no  explanation) that evolution and Mormonism are compatible.   For example,  apostle Widtsoe said:<br />The law of evolution .... Does not require that all  things, all life, shall have a common origin.  It merely declares that  everything in the universe is moving onward.&quot; [page xi].<br />I'm sure  this statement will come as a complete surprise to any evolutionary  biologist.<br />Other Mormon apologists define a type of &quot;divine&quot;  evolution, in which they allow the evolution of one species into another,  but only through the guidance of deity.  Both these definitions are without  any basis in the scientific theory of evolution, however.  Consequently,  the &quot;definition thing&quot; becomes a real stumbling block when trying  to have a meaningful conversation with Mormon apologists who insist they  believe in evolution, only to find that what they really believe is a  smattering of real scientific principles that are hopelessly mixed in a  morass of mythology.<br />Not all the essays deal with semantics, double  meanings, and denial, however.  A number of them are quite informative.   Chapter 3, for example, outlines the evolution controversy at Brigham Young  University, and the firing of three professors who taught evolution on  campus and refused to stop.  The chapter is very detailed, with lots of  interesting historical highlights, and is well referenced. <br />Essay 5  raises some interesting ideas I've not seen in the apologetic literature  before, but unfortunately the author (Richard Sherlock) did not see fit to  carry the discussion through on any of the really interesting concepts.   For example, on page 71 he says:<br />&quot;Furthermore Mormon  anthropomorphism made God the prototype of man; Adam was literally his  offspring.  To think of a being made in the literal image of God as the  result of decent from other forms of life was a difficult move  indeed.&quot;<br />In fact, the problem goes much deeper than this.  According  to the theory of evolution, people share a common ancestor with apes.That  means Jesus (through is mother, Mary) also has a common evolutionary  ancestor with the apes.  It seems the vast majority of Mormons, and  certainly all Mormon leaders, would reject such a conclusion, yet the  author simply drops the discussion at this point, and never picks it back  up.  Mormonism is quite specific on the origin of humans and their literal  image of God. The persistent problem with virtually all Mormon apologetics on the subject of  evolution is that it tends to deal with the opinions of the shrinking pool  of intellectuals within the Mormon community, while ignoring the opinions  and beliefs of common Mormons.  Though the book points out that 75% of Salt  Lake City Mormons reject evolution, the authors never delve more into that  issue, or why Mormons, more than almost any other religion, are so likely  to believe in creationism.<br />Another problem is the persistent reliance  upon assertion and opinion.  Many of the essayists assert that Mormonism is  compatible with evolution, but none of them explain how or why - especially  in light of the very strong statements against evolution made by Mormon  ecclesiastical leaders when interpreting Mormon scripture.  I don't recall  a single specific reference to any Mormon scriptures in all the essays I  read.<br />So, this is basically a book written by Mormon apologists, for  Mormon apologists who want to remain in the Mormon Church, and need some  way out of the conundrum created by the anti-evolutionary rhetoric of  Mormon ecclesiastical leaders.  If that's you, the book will probably be  worth while.  <br />One last thing.  The book lacks an index, so make sure to  have your yellow marker, red pen, and sticky highlighter ready.	1999-06-15
US	53038410	RUPSI1BQV3IU2	0824799232	454051522	Diffraction Gratings and Applications (Optical Science and Engineering)	Books	5	13	13	N	N	A practical, up-to-date assessment of the entire field	E. G. Loewen and E. Popov's &quot;Diffraction gratings and applications&quot; is among the most complete books on diffraction gratings I've seen.  The book is written for the practicing scientist and engineer, with a definite emphasis on practicality.  This is a long book (588 pages)  so it may seem odd that one of my complaints is its abbreviated treatment  of some subjects.  <br />The book begins with a rather brief, but interesting,  history of spectral analysis (chapter 1).  Chapter 2 discusses some of the  fundamental properties of gratings, including the grating equation,  propagation of evanescent orders, dispersion, free spectral range, and  diffraction efficiency.  Since chapter 2 lays the foundation for later  discussions, I found it too abbreviated for a self-contained book on the  subject.  Derivations, and the accompanying insight they bring, are  relatively rare in this book.  Overall, however, the book is written more  as a reference source than a textbook, and from that perspective the level  of review and discussion in chapter 2 is about right.<br />Chapter 3 is a very  brief introduction (at the qualitative description level) of various types  of gratings such as phase, relief, reflection, transmission, symmetrical,  blazed, ruled, holographic, lithographic, plane, concave, Bragg, and  waveguide gratings.  This is a very short chapter, and typically devotes  only a paragraph or two to describing each type of grating.  Unlike other  chapters, with their copious endnotes, chapter 2 has only three references.  <br />Chapter 4 describes the efficiency behavior of plane reflection  gratings, and has a tremendous amount of information showing sensitivities  to groove spacing, departure from Littrow condition, coating with various  metals, modulation depth, groove shape, etc.  This chapter is excellent  reference material.  It has virtually no theory, but instead focuses on  actual measurements and data quantifying the behavior of these gratings.   According to the book's promotional literature, this is the first time (in  a single reference) that so much data has been provided on the efficiency  and behavior of gratings.  The only difficulty I had with this chapter is  that sometimes the various graphs use different scales, making it tricky at  times to draw conclusions based on direct comparisons.  Chapter 5 is a  similar treatment of transmission gratings, with considerably less measured  data.  The authors devote chapter 6 to echelle gratings.  As with chapter  4, there is a great deal of information in the form of efficiency curves  for echelles.<br />Chapter 7 introduces concave gratings.  Unlike chapters 4  and 6, there is little actual data in chapter 7, and more theoretical  background treatment.  Much of the theoretical treatment is very  abbreviated, however.  Chapter 8 deals with surface waves and grating  anomalies.  I found this chapter to be among the most interesting, with a  better mix of theoretical explanation as well as lots of graphs showing the  results of real-world experiments.   Chapter 9 describes waveguide, fiber,  and acousto-optic gratings.  This chapter is likely to be more applicable  to many people with the advent of DWDM telecommunications networks.  <br />I  often found myself having difficulty following some of the author's  derivations.  Partly, this is because the authors don't use symbols for  variables and constants consistently.  For someone such as myself, with a  background in physics but no specialized background in gratings, I found  this often confusing.  A case in point is equation (9.4) in which there  appears to be a factor of beta squared missing.  I'm not sure of this,  however, because the substitution of equations (9.1) and (9.3) into  equation (9.2) does not seem to maintain consistent usage of the variables.   As a result, I'm left wondering if there is a misprint in the book, or if  I've simply not followed the authors properly in their derivation.  I'm  sure the issue would be straightforward for someone more familiar with the  problem, but I found it somewhat confusing.<br />Chapter 10 is a very  interesting review of electromagnetic theories and of grating efficiency.   There is virtually no theory described in this chapter, but rather a  summary look at the various methods, and discussion about their relative  tradeoffs and merits. <br />The rest of the book deals with work-a-day issues  surrounding gratings: Testing, instrumental systems, damage, mechanical  ruling machines, holographic grating recording, and alternative methods of  grating manufacture.  These last chapters contain mostly qualitative  information, but also provide deep insight learned from a lifetime of  experience.  <br />Each chapter (with the exception of chapter 3) is  exceedingly well referenced, with lots of diagrams and figures.  Even so,  the book tackles such a wide range of subjects that its coverage of some  subjects is superficial.  For the most part, however, those who work with  gratings and grating-based equipment will find this book is an  indispensable addition to their personal libraries.  It occupies a  prominent position in mine<br />Duwayne Anderson	1999-03-10
US	53038410	R1IM6RDTDO31SC	0716733870	702232531	Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time	Books	5	435	466	N	N	The weird things people believe.	My first impression upon finishing this book is that the title is wrong.  Though Dr. Shermer addresses some issues about why people believe weird things, for the most part this book is more about the weird things people  believe, and not so much about the reasons they believe them.  For a better  discussion about why people believe weird things, I suggest Thomas  Gilovich's book &quot;How we know what isn't so.&quot; <br />Shermer devotes  all of chapter one to expanding on the definition and characteristics of a  skeptic, and all of chapter two to describing science.  This lays the  bedrock for his future discussions about pseudosciences such as  creationism, and helps to make clear the reasons these pseudosciences and  superstitions fail to meet the demanding requirements of science.  He  explains that a skeptic is not synonymous with a cynic.  Instead, a skeptic  is someone who questions the validity of a particular claim by calling for  evidence to prove or disprove it.  As such, skepticism is an essential part  of the scientific method. <br />Chapter 3 is a jewel.  It describes 25 ways in  which thinking goes wrong.  Reading this chapter left me wondering if these  rules for fallacious reasoning are not encoded somewhere as the rules for  participation in some of the more notorious Internet newsgroups devoted to  various mythologies. <br />The second part of the book examines claims of the  paranormal, near-death experiences, alien abductions, witch crazes, and  cults.  Although these stories make interesting reading, they are same  examples of debunking we have seen for years.  I, for one, would appreciate  a fresher skeptical approach that is not so (apparently) reluctant to  challenge the claims of institutionalized religions.  Is transubstantiation  any more credible than claims of the paranormal?  Are alien abduction  stories any less credible than the Book of Mormon's claims about a large,  literate Hebrew society in America 2,000 years ago, that used horse-drawn  chariots and steel swords?   Are witch crazes any more significant than  some Christians who let their children die rather than bringing them proper  medical treatment?  I think not, and I believe it is time for skeptics to  broaden their portfolio beyond the usual array of paranormal activities and  alien abductions.<br />Shermer devotes chapters 9 through 11 to the conflict  between creationism and evolution.  This section of the book has a  wonderful summary of the legal battles fought to keep the religion of  creationism out of public schools.  Chapter 10 has an excellent description  of what is evolution, and a very brief summary of 25 arguments used by  creationists against evolution, along with counter arguments used by  scientists.  Interestingly enough, Shermer offers very little in the way of  direct evidence against creationism - of which there is a tremendous amount  - and focuses mostly on how to defend evolution.  Unfortunately, he has  truncated his 25 arguments so much that they are of little practical use -  especially against more polished debaters.  Shermer admits this at the  beginning of the chapter, and does offer an excellent bibliography of more  detailed references for the reader.<br />Shermer's defense of evolution bogs  down when he encroaches on the idea that evolution is not a threat to  religion.  [This is how I interpreted Shermer, though he is not entirely  clear about his personal feelings regarding this matter.]   Science most  certainly is a threat to some religions - creationism, for example (and  Shermer argues throughout his book that creationism is a religion - which  is why it should not be taught in public schools).  It seems obvious to me  that sometimes science does threaten religion (more some than others) - but  that is religion's problem, not science'.  Scientists should stop  apologizing for that fact.<br />In trying to sooth the potential conflict  between science and religion, Shermer quotes Stephen J. Gould(one of my  favorite authors).  Interestingly, Gould (uncharacteristically) offers a  spectacular example of some of the bogus reasoning Shermer discredits in  chapter 3.  Gould says (page 132):<br />&quot;Unless at least half my  colleagues are dunces, there can be - on the most raw and empirical grounds  - no conflict between science and religion.&quot;<br />Here, Gould violates  Shermer's rule 19 (overreliance on authorities - Gould's colleagues in this  case).  Then, Gould leaves us wondering if, instead, we are to consider the  other half of Gould's colleagues (the half that apparently do not agree  with him) as dunces.<br />To his credit, Shermer provides a definition of  religion on page 145 (though he offers no definition of God).  I am not  sure he makes the matter any clearer by doing so, however, since his  definition of religion (as a method) places it as the antithesis of science  (also defined as a method).  Yet, I got the impression from his book that  Shermer agrees (on a fundamental level) that there need not be any  disagreement between science and religion.<br />Part 4 discusses racism and  pseudohistory in the case of holocaust deniers.  This part seemed out of  place in the book primarily because Shermer spends comparatively little  time discussing the weirdness of the opposing camp, instead focusing mostly  on his perceptions.  Though I agree with him on most points, I could no  shake the feeling the chapters belong in a different book with a different  title.<br />In the last section (section 5) Shermer gets back on track and  finishes with an interesting view of the societal role science plays, and  the roll it will play in the future.  Shermer holds hope for the human  race, in spite of its sometimes-overbearing tendency toward mysticism.  He  also gives a wonderful summary of why people believe weird things: because  it feels good.  Though I would like to know more about why it feels good, I  cannot argue with his conclusion.<br />Overall,this was an excellent book.   Dr. Shermer is a clear thinker.  His ability to focus on the central issues  and facts makes this book refreshingly illuminating. His personal touch,  brought through stories of actual life experiences, adds to the pleasure of  reading his book. <br />Duwayne Anderson	1999-03-05
US	53038410	RQYALXWH7IB1G	156085085X	370702957	In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith	Books	5	361	388	N	N	An excellent book	It is hard to find a book about early Mormonism that does not focus almost exclusively on Joseph Smith.  As founder of the Mormon religion, this may not seem surprising, but it's refreshing just the same to read Todd  Compton's book with its almost exclusive focus on Joseph's wives, and  comparatively little focus on the Mormon prophet.<br />Compton's book consists  of 30 chapters; each written as a biography of the various women Joseph  Smith married, with the conspicuous absence of Emma Smith.  This highlights  and emphasizes the fact that, though Joseph had many wives, they were all  rejected by Emma who vigorously opposed polygamy and the intrusions it  brought into her home. <br />Studying Mormon history has become a mixed  blessing.  On one hand, historical scholarship of the subject has advanced  greatly since Bodie's landmark &quot;No man knows my History.&quot;  On the  other hand, excommunication of prominent historians (such as Quinn and  Brodie) by the Mormon Church has resulted in much fear and distrust.  For  most Mormons, Todd Compton's book probably falls outside the designation of  &quot;faith promoting,&quot; and may be uncomfortable for many active  members of the church.<br />Growing up in the Mormon Church, I learned several  myths about early Mormon polygamy such as: 1. A man's wife had to approve  the marriage to plural wives.   2. Most plural wives were older women whose  husbands had died, and for whom polygamy represented safe heaven from a  brutal world.   3. Most of Joseph's plural wives were sealed to him, but  had no sexual relationship with him. 4. Joseph's plural wives never became  pregnant from him. 5. There was never any admission or even mention of  polyandry.<br />Through the biographies he has constructed, Compton exposes  each of these myths.  Chapter 1 discusses Fanny Alger, who married Joseph  when she was only sixteen and he was twenty-seven.  Emma didn't know about  the marriage, and when she learned of it (by seeing Fannyand Joseph  together, by one account, and noticing Fanny's pregnancy by another account  - see pages 34-35) drove Fanny from their house.   Oliver Cowdery (one of  the Book-of-Mormon witnesses) described Joseph's relationship with Fanny as  a sexual affair, and accused Joseph of adultery - resulting in Oliver's  excommunication in 1838 (see pages 38-39).<br />Compton spends considerable  effort reconciling Cowdery's description of Fanny Alger as an affair, and  others who clearly describe a marriage relationship (though without the  approval or knowledge of Emma).  As I read the book I kept expecting  Compton to draw the obvious conclusion, that Joseph had an affair with  Fanny and then invented polygamy (which he may have been contemplating  anyway) to save his presidency and justify his actions.  Compton, however,  never draws this conclusion, and ends still contemplating the two possible  scenarios as mutually exclusive.<br />I found particular interest in this book  because one of Joseph Smith's plural wives, Melissa Lott, was my great,  great, great grandmother (see chapter 28).  Like many of his other plural  wives, Melissa was young (only 19) when she married Joseph Smith.  Growing  up Mormon, my parents taught me that Melissa had been a  &quot;spiritual&quot; wife of Joseph Smith, having been sealed to Joseph  only after his death (a common occurrence).  During an interview with  Joseph Smith's son, and President of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ  of Latter-day Saints, however, Melissa stated that she had been a wife  indeed, with full benefit of a sexual relationship with the prophet.   Melissa married Joseph less than a year before he was murdered and later  married my great, great, great grandfather.  Both lived hard lives, and her  second husband died (along with their young son) when the wagon he was  driving turned over with its load of firewood and drowned them in a creek.   It was a touching chapter for me, the more so because Melissa is myancestor, and illustrates the central theme of all Joseph's plural wives:  sacred loneliness and lives of hard work and toil.<br />Passionately written  through the eyes of those who knew him, loved him, followed him, and  counted on him for salvation, Compton's book is a must for anyone  interested in Mormon history and the personal lives that launched this  twentieth-century American religion.  Meticulously researched and well  written, I highly recommend it.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1999-03-05
US	53038410	R6PJ5LH5OAZ43	0471155365	975840898	Are We Unique: A Scientist Explores the Unparalleled Intelligence of the Human Mind	Books	3	10	11	N	N	Trefil proves Humans are more human than any other species.	I have read a number of Trefil's books, including &quot;Meditations at 10,000 feet: A scientist in the mountains,&quot; and &quot;From atoms to quarks.&quot;  Ordinarily, I enjoy Trefil's books, which are typically  written with a clear and concise style that is at once entertaining,  informative, and easy to read.  It was with some disappointment, therefore,  that I read his latest book &quot;Are we unique.&quot;  Trefil seems to  have left some of his scientific objectivity behind in a personal quest to  show humans are not only trivially unique, but somehow the most unique  thing in the universe.<br />To his credit, Trefil openly admits his personal  objective, where he says:<br />Make no mistake, though.  This isn't going to  be a cool, dispassionate examination of an intellectual problem.  I  desperately want to find a way out of this dilemma [about human  uniqueness], and intend to devote whatever scientific skills I've developed  in my career to finding it.&quot;  [See page 13.]<br />The first problem is  that Trefil never really defines what he means by uniqueness.  Throughout  the book, I alternately got the impression that uniqueness to him means not  reproducible, different in magnitude from all other species, or more  complex and wonderful than all other things.  The problem is that he never  offers a good explanation why any of this is either true, or important.   For example, humans are clearly reproducible.  All you have to do is visit  the local maternity ward to prove that.  Yet, Trefil spends almost all of  the second half of the book arguing that a computer cannot reproduce human  thought, without clearly explaining why silicon is the issue.  What if  humans derive the future ability to build a more intelligent biological  lifeform?  What would that do to his premise?<br />Trefil argues that simply  because other species have the germ of human capabilities, such as limited  ability to communicate, humans are so far advanced that we deserve uniquestatus based on magnitude alone.  What continually strikes me about this  argument is the amount of specism inherent in the tests.  For example,  Trefil shows how lobsters use their sense of smell to discern the presence  of other lobsters by the release of urine in the water.  Essentially,  lobsters &quot;see&quot; through their sense of smell.  Then, he proceeds  to describe experiments in which animals are shown their image in a mirror,  with a bright red spot painted on their forehead.  Those who recognize  their image, and try to get the red spot off, are categorized as &quot;self  aware,&quot; while those who blithely ignore the image receive a lesser  classification.  I could not help wondering if an intelligent race of  lobsters would deem humans not self aware because, upon being tossed into a  swimming pool with their urine, they failed to recognize themselves.  We  are visual animals, and place an inordinate amount of emphasis on that  sense, forgetting that other animals see the world through senses we hardly  recognize in our daily lives. <br />The other part of this argument I find  very illuminating is that humans invariably focus on things we consider to  be good qualities when asserting our special uniqueness among animals.   Trefil focuses on intelligence, for example.  He might just as well have  argued that humans are unique because we are the only species to  incarcerate other members of our clan.  This tendency to find uniqueness in  good traits, while ignoring our dark, but equally unique nature, makes me  wonder if the entire discussion isn't so contaminated by the bias of  specism as to make the conversation pointless.<br />Having demonstrated, to  his satisfaction, that humans are unique among animals, Trefil proceeds to  show that no computer can mimic the human mind.  Here, I find he makes some  rather good points.  There really is no reason to assume a digital computer  can model the human mind, since there is no good reason to assume the human  mind is digital in the first place.  I particularly enjoyed his discussion  about how the human brain works.  In making his point, Trefil touches on  chaos, the electro-chemical nature of the brain, self-organization, and  emergent properties of complex systems.   All of this makes for interesting  reading.<br />Throughout the book, I found myself asking why this uniqueness  seems so important to some individuals.  Personally, I have never felt  threatened by a computer that could beat me in chess (an easy thing to do),  a car that goes faster than I can run, or an animal that might learn to  communicate with me.  I am not at all afraid of discovering my biological  connection with animals.  Consequently, I had a consistently difficult time  relating to the concerns that motivated Trefil to write his book.  <br />Just  the same, Trefil's book was worth reading, and I found much of the  supporting information particularly insightful.  I am not sure he supported  his thesis very well, and I do not understand the motivation to assert  human uniqueness (at least in the sense that we are somehow more unique  than other species).  Just the same, it is good to read alternate points of  view.  This is a complicated area, and anyone interested in where we fit in  the cosmos should hear all sides.  Other books related to this subject  matter include &quot;When Elephants Weep,&quot; by Jeffrey Moussaieff  Masson and Susan McCarthy, and &quot;Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors,&quot;  by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1999-03-05

Chaotic systems exhibit a type of behavior where vanishingly-small  perturbations in initial conditions result in wild and unpredictable  alterations in a system's final state.  The butterfly in China, flapping  its wings, results in a hurricane off the coast of Florida 100 years  later.<br />James Burke takes us on an intersected voyage through the web of  history, and in the process shows the intricately connected nature of our  lives in a chaotic mishmash of intersecting events.  The mental imagery I  concocted while reading his book was one of a small worm making its way  through a biscuit of shredded wheat.  With thousands of intersecting  strands, and billions of route possibilities open at each juncture, my  biscuit gives a feel for the intricate connection that every event in  history shares with everything else.  In fact, Burke has written his book  from the worm's perspective, with branch points identified in the margins  so you can follow a thread (instead of the book) as it weaves its way  through history.  You do not need to read this book sequentially, and quite  possibly might choose to read it worm style rather than cover to  cover.<br />When I first began Burke's book I looked for the obvious  connections, but soon learned that was not his objective.  Though he  illustrates obvious connections, much of the interelatedness in Burke's  book deals with subtle effects that changed people's lives and resulted in  dramatic changes in history.    Sometimes the stories become so intricate I  found myself taking notes so I could mentally trace back through the web of  events.  <br />Most of the historical events he covers relate in some way to  scientific or technical achievements and discoveries.  In some of these, I  found myself confused about the terminology used.  Burke is not always  clear when he comments about aparticular discovery, whether he is making a  statement about the way things are viewed today, or how they were viewed by  the original discoverers.  Because of this, I found myself sometimes  irritated by technically incorrect descriptions.  For example, on page 198  Burke says:<br />&quot;There was only one thing that would reflect radio waves  besides metal reflectors like the ones Hertz had used: ionized atoms, which  had lost one or more of their electrons.  These atoms became positively  charged and would reflect electronic signals (which were  negative).&quot;<br />While it is true that ions are positively charged, radio  waves are not negative.   In another place, he describes voltage as charge  (see page 186).  He also mentions, off handedly, that collimated laser  beams spread by only &quot;a few feet&quot; over the distance between the  earth and moon (see page 75).  [A collimated beam, with a wavelength of 600  nm, will have a half-beam divergence of about 48 feet over the distance  between the earth and moon when collimated with a telescope having a  10-meter-diameter primary mirror.  See, for example, Saleh, Teich,  &quot;Fundamentals of Photonics,&quot; Wiley Series in Pure and applied  optics, equation 3.1-20.]<br />These examples left me with a sometimes uneasy  feeling about the book's technical accuracy, yet I cannot discount the  possibility that Burke was simply explaining these phenomena in the context  of the way they were understood when first discovered.  <br />The book has an  excellent index.  The figures, however, are of generally poor quality and  hard to see.  Another irritant was the frequent and often-detailed  descriptions Burke gives of ingenious and complex machinery and gadgets.   These descriptions are often very hard to follow, and would benefit greatly  from drawings that support the textual descriptions.<br />Aside from these few  criticisms, however, I found Burke's book most enjoyable.  It will broaden  your horizons and make you appreciate history from a new perspective.  An  ideal book for just before bedtime, I highly recommend it.<br />Duwayne  Anderson	1999-02-19
US	53038410	R282R0I9CANOLH	0134898656	928169863	Wavelength Division Multiplexing (Prentice Hall International Series in Optoelectronics)	Books	3	2	2	N	N	An historical perspective of DWDM	Wavelength division multiplexing has become the next frontier in optical fiber communications, and has begun penetrating the world-wide lightwave network with astonishing speed.  In an environment such as this, it's not  too surprising to find a text that is barely six years old and already  becoming obsolete.  Jean-Pierre Laude's book &quot;Wavelength Division  Multiplexing&quot; offers a number of other advantages, however, and will  still find a useful purpose in the fiber-optic engineer's library.<br />This  book covers a broad spectrum, but many of the chapters and subject material  are greatly compressed.  The book's total length is less than 200 pages.   This offers both advantages and disadvantages.  On the positive side, this  book is a useful desk reference.  It has extensive references to the  scientific literature, often citing much of the most important original  work.  In doing this it offers a fine historical perspective for wavelength  division multiplexing.  On the negative side (with a few exceptions) the  student is left without the added benefit afforded by even the most simple  and abbreviated derivations.  If you understand the material a priori, this  book will serve as a good refresher course.  However, if you are  approaching dense wavelength division multiplexing for the first time,  other sources will be more useful (I suggest Decker, &quot;Fiber Optic Test  and Measurement&quot; as a good introductory text).<br />The book begins with  a summary of electromagnetic propagation in optical fibers, and gives a  good summary of some of the fundamental waveguide equations and a brief  discussion about geometrical approximations in multimode fibers.  The  author takes a brief respite to describe a broad range of multiplexers and  demultiplexers of various designs.  The central part of the book involves  considerable detail (sometimes esoteric) regarding the specific  construction of grating multiplexers.  This detail far exceeds that given  to other multiplexer designs, which may not be surprising since this is the  author's specific field of expertise.<br />The second half of the book deals  with system-level considerations, including optical amplifiers and  topologies.  The book ends with some broad conclusions about possibilities  and future directions.<br />Throughout the book, Jean-Pierre Laude gives  frequent examples of heroic performance in work prior to 1993 when the book  was published.  This focus on (what was then) current performance of  devices detracts, I believe, from the underlying theoretical issues that  are more time invariant.  From an historical perspective, however, the  information is useful.<br />The book is well organized, but very abbreviated.   The subject matter could easily occupy a book with several times the number  of pages.  As with the rest of the book's format, the index is virtually  useless, being only 1.5 pages long.  Plan on using lots of page markers to  make the book more useful for future reference.   I also found the  equations sometimes difficult to read because of the typeset.  <br />Am I glad  I took the time to read the book?  Yes.  It only took a week, and was a  worthwhile summary of what is arguably the most important technological  innovation to come along since the development of lightwave communication  systems.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1998-12-11
US	53038410	RFHIHRTX54ZF9	052145039X	862318508	Why Things Are the Way They Are	Books	4	32	32	N	N	It's really a book about beginning solid-state physics	I was a bit surprised upon reading Chandrasekhar's book &quot;Why things are the Way they Are.&quot;  I expected a book that describes the things we see about us in everyday life, but this is a book about solid-state  physics.  But solid-state physics is the reason things are the way they  are.  So, Chandrasekhar hit the nail right on the head.   <br />Not only in  the title, but throughout the book, Chandrasekhar illustrates that rare  ability to understand the deep significance behind the really important  things in science.   Nonscientists may be inclined to believe that the  quantum world is far removed from our lives, and has little effect on our  macroscopic world.  Chandrasekhar dashes these notions with many examples,  from the color of gold, to the bite of an accidentally touched hot plate.   The world in which we live would indeed be a much different place if  fermions had symmetric wave functions, and bosons had antisymmetric wave  functions, and we would not recognize our world if atoms and crystals did  not have quantum fluctuations.<br />I could not help wishing I'd had the  opportunity to read this book as a young student in High School.  This is  an excellent text that, without quantitative analysis, introduces almost  all the important concepts of solid-state physics with illuminating  examples of how these phenomena exhibit themselves in our everyday world.   Even for first-year students in college physics, the book has great value  in its qualitative, examples-oriented way of presenting the quantum world.   For those of us with degrees in science, the book offers additional insight  and easy bedtime reading.  <br />The topics are broad.  Beginning with crystal  symmetry, the author introduces, step by step, the concepts of  particle-wave duality and isolated electrons bound to protons in the  hydrogen atom.  There is a brief respite to discuss some elementary issues  relating to statistical physics, and then a weaving of the entire tapestry  intoa qualitative view of the quantum crystal.  <br />With this background  (which occupies roughly half the book's volume) Chandrasekhar shows how to  use these new tools to understand some of the common phenomena in the world  in which we live.  He explains electrical conductivity, thermal  conductivity, and the color of metals; why gold is yellow and copper red,  and why glass is transmissive.  There is a brief discussion about magnets,  and his discussion about superconductors is among the best I've seen for  the lay audience.   <br />Each chapter has a summary at the end.  For the most  part these summaries are actually useful, and give a brief review of the  information learned in the chapter.  Other summaries, however, revert to a  type of index, and I found these less useful.  The book has a nice index  that should help when searching for various subjects, and is organized  well, with a logical flow.  <br />About the only thing I found wanting was a  statement in the introduction to the effect that science isn't sure if  living things can be explained by the laws of physics.  The author  apparently believes questions about life should not have been addressed in  his book, but are rather important matter for philosophers, and theologians  as well as scientists.   Other than this brief foray into the nebulous  realm of superstition, the book is an excellent read.  I highly recommend  it.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1998-11-19
US	53038410	R375HTUXXKGW8U	0684818221	984295817	About Time: Einstein's Unfinished Revolution	Books	4	9	10	N	N	We still don't know what it is.	If you've ever wondered what is time, where did it come from, does it flow, why does it seem to go in one direction, will it have an end, or is it slowing down, you'll not find your answers in Paul Davies' book  &quot;About Time.&quot;  Neither are you likely to find your answers  anywhere else.  For me, the most profound knowledge that came from reading  Davies' book is the reminder that we really don't know what time is.  We  live in it, experience it, but really - on a fundamental level - fail to  comprehend it.<br />Davies has subtitled his book &quot;Einstein's unfinished  revolution,&quot; and he does an excellent job of exposing the reader to  some of the unexpected (from a common-sense point of view) conclusions we  draw about time from the special and general theories of relativity.   He  offers an interesting historical perspective on the life of Einstein, and  how he developed his theories.  Davies also provides some interesting  background on experiments that have validated Einstein's space-time,  reviewing the qualitative results from some of the more important  experiments.<br />After this introduction to the non-universal time of  relativity, Davies takes us to the ultimate time machine: black holes.  He  offers some interesting explanations about what an imaginary traveler to a  black hole might see looking out, and how we - looking in - might view the  hapless victim as she neared the event horizon.  <br />As the book progresses,  conclusions and examples become less and less concrete.  Relative time is a  proven fact, and most physicists consider black holes a foregone  conclusion.  From there, Davies takes us to the very root of some of the  biggest issues in cosmology: the origin of time and the age of the  universe.  Davies clearly believes there are problems with the current  Big-Bang theory of the universe, and proposes Einstein's cosmological  constant as one possible solution.  <br />Things get weirder still.  From  cosmology he moves to quantum time and the implications of tunneling and  EPR experiments.  There is some brief mention of Hawking's imaginary time  and, of course, no book on time would be complete without a chapter on  possible time travel.  Davies looks at all the possibilities, and some of  the discussions and speculation runs wild.<br />For the most part I really  enjoyed this book.  It is well written, and clear, but sometimes the author  fails to define terms properly.  He appears to use the term &quot;timewarp  factor&quot; synonymously with &quot;time-dilation factor&quot; but the  formula on page 58 disagrees with the top figure on page 61.  Also, in his  discussions about problems with the Big Bang theory, I felt the author  failed to give sufficient coverage to inflationary models of the universe  that might resolve some of the issues he raised.<br />Overall, Davies' book is  worth the time to read it.  It may not answer all the deepest questions  about time, but it will help you appreciate how little of the subject we  truly comprehend.  I'd also recommend his book &quot;The Last Three  Minutes.&quot;<br />Duwayne Anderson	1998-11-19
US	53038410	R3IHR37I18TZB6	0070246793	3672359	ADSL and DSL Technologies	Books	4	30	31	N	N	A comprehensive overview of xDSL	Writing a popular book about xDSL technology is a daunting task, but one  that Walter Goralski largely accomplishes in his book \\"ADSL and DSL  technologies.\\"  The book begins with a global view of the US  telecommunications network, how the Internet is challenging this network,  and what technologies are being developed to address the problems.  This  world view does an excellent job of placing xDSL technologies in  perspective:  they are solutions to digital data transport over portions of  a telecommunications network designed specifically for analog voice  traffic.  <br />The author has provide an excellent summary of how the  American telephone network began, how it evolved, the various regulatory  actions along the way, and the current state of affairs.  For example, many  people familiar with load coils and bridge taps know they can cause  problems for xDSL technologies.  Goralski explains how these devices got  into the network in the first place, and the specific problems they pose  for digital high-speed technologies.  As part of this discussion the author  describes the first analog systems, later digital systems, multiplexing and  trunk topologies, different switching technologies (packet and circuit) and  the first wave of digital services such as ISDN.<br />After a brief discussion  of modems, the author launches into the main subject, which is the xDSL  family of products and technology.  He gives a brief high-level  descriptions of HDSL, SDSL, RADSL, CDSL, IDSL, ADSL, and VDSL.  Up to this  point the number of acronyms is relatively manageable, but once he begins  discussing xDSL in earnest the acronyms emerge exponentially.  Fortunately,  Goralski has a list of about 250 acronyms in the back of the book.  This  list is especially useful later in the book where the author uses them with  abandon.  Though extensive, the list is not complete.  For example, the  acronyms PCM and STU are not included.  Of course, the author says there is  \\"really no suchthing as an `STU,' at least not as a standard device.\\"   This only adds to the confusion of the use of such an acronym, and  contributes to the \\"acronym overload\\" one often feels when reading this  book.<br />After the brief introduction to the xDSL family, the author devotes  a full chapter each to HDSL and then to ADSL.  After this, the book deals  almost exclusively with ADSL-related issues (except for a chapter on VDSL  at the back of the book).  <br />I was disappointed the author spent so little  time describing the digital coding techniques that are so important for DSL  technologies.  Except for a brief mention of QAM, the author leaves his  audience almost entirely in the dark as to how the digital codes work, and  what are their individual strengths and weaknesses.  <br />The author goes  into considerable detail (more than any other individual topic) describing  the ADSL architecture and interface systems. Chapter nine, dealing with  ADSL interfaces, is confusing and would benefit from more diagrams.   Several subjects are discussed without proper introduction, leading to  questions people might ask if they are not already familiar with the  terminology.   Additional topics in the book's midsection include  descriptions of transport classes, bearer channels, frames, super frames,  frame structure, interleaved data, and overhead.   The author also provides  considerable high-level detail about various configurations in which ADSL  can be deployed.<br />The book ends with three of its most important chapters.   Chapter 13 describes migration scenarios from the various derivatives of  xDSL to ADSL, and from ADSL to VDSL.  Chapter 14 describes VDSL in more  detail, since the author apparently concludes VDSL will be the ultimate  mechanism by which telecommunications companies will provide truly  broadband services.  Chapter 15 finishes with a discussion about the major  outstanding issues for DSL.  These last chapters are especially useful for  global thinking and positioning.<br />Goralski discusses some market issues  for the deployment of ADSL, but most of the book centers on technical  topics.  The author clearly favors xDSL technologies, with the apparent  conclusion it will win the day over cable modems.  It would be useful,  however, to see more detailed analysis in this area, especially regarding  cost for deployment.  Though Internet access (e.g. as offered via xDSL) is  important, Internet access alone will be unable to compete against true  broadband services offering video on demand in addition to fast Internet  access.  Goralski seems to recognize this when he discusses VDSL, but even  here he fails to address economic issues and whether VDSL can compete on  price with cable modems.<br />Goralski has a clear, readable style, and the  book has many figures that greatly help in assimilating ideas.  On the  negative side, the index is inadequate.  When reading my copy I used lots  of colored markers and sticky tabs so I could go back and find important  information.  The book also has many typographical errors.   Clearly, this  book went to print in a hurry, though this might be somewhat unavoidable  given the subject matter and rate with which technology is progressing.   None of the typographical errors cause significant problems with  comprehension.  Most are like the one on page 12, where the word \\"enabled\\"  was spelled as \\"abled.\\" Overall, however, I really enjoyed reading this  book.  If you are just learning about ADSL technologies, or want to brush  up on the subject I highly recommend it.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1998-09-01
US	53038410	R2THDZFOGD3Q1F	0875845851	889399178	The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail	Books	4	144	158	N	N	A new paradigm	We have all seen large, powerful, and successful corporations upstaged and driven out of business by startups using new ideas to grow exponentially and dominate the new business landscape.  In his book \\"The Innovator's Dilemma,\\" Clayton M. Christensen provides a unique and novel theory that explains why entrenched corporations often fail to capitalize on such new ideas, and fall prey to firms with fewer initial resources.  With enough data and case histories to make even the skeptic sit up and take notice, Christensen sculpts an argument that demands our attention at once.  Step by step he shows that such extinctions come about not necessarily because of arrogance and dogmatism (though these play their parts) but because of the architectural and organizational structures that make good companies good.   Like Einstein's theory of relativity, with its concepts of relative time and space, some of Christensen's conclusions seem unintuitive.  Others even seem contrary to phy! sical reality.  Sometimes it really is wrong to listen to your customers.  Sometimes it is better to build a product with low margin and a limited market rather than build a product with high margin and large, virtually guaranteed market.<br />Christensen builds his thesis upon the notion that technology comes in two broad flavors: sustaining and disruptive.  Established product lines use sustaining technology  to make incremental improvements.  In the language of biology, sustaining technology facilitates gradual Darwinian evolution where incremental improvements coupled with survival of the fittest lead to gradual product improvement.  For example, tire manufacturers use sustaining technology to enhance the tread, sidewall, and belt design of automotive tires.  Sustaining technology is not trivial, and often involves tremendous expenditures of capital.  It is, however, what established companies do best, and these companies have developed very effective organizational and manag! erial structures for dealing with it. <br />Disruptive technol! ogy, on the other hand, approaches product evolution outside the sustaining envelope.  Disruptive technologies typically offer a cheaper solution to a small, often unidentified subgroup.  Once established within this small market the disruptive technology evolves through sustaining technology until it eventually satisfies the performance criteria of more traditional markets.  When this happens, the disruptive technology bursts onto the scene, attacking the soft underbelly of the established corporations, often with fatalistic consequences.  In the parlance of evolutionary biology, disruptive technology is like punctuated evolution; fast with significant changes in the gene pool.<br />Christensen may be excused for lacking the breadth to discuss similarities between such diverse fields as biology and business management.  Still, the book would have benefited immeasurably by a co-author in the field who might have offered greater insight into universal principles governing the evol! ution of complex systems.  Repeatedly I found myself going to books by authors such as Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould to refine my mental image of the multidimensional landscape in which biological organisms and industrial businesses compete for the resources of survival.<br />The book is well written and persuasive in its arguments.  It questions many established ideas and shows that often these ideas fail to apply to disruptive technologies.   Often the best corporations are especially susceptible.  Defense against disruptive technologies does not come from being smarter and working closer with customers.  Paradoxically, working closely with customers and following established rules for corporate investment often make a company more susceptible to harm from disruptive technologies.  Companies naturally evolve toward higher-end products with greater margins.  Consequently, they find it difficult to enter markets with disruptive technologies that often begin with low margi! ns, are technologically simple, and do not have a clearly d! efined customer base.  Such markets are ideal for start-up firms.  The author suggests, with several case histories, that one of the best ways for established firms to deal with disruptive technologies is to spin off autonomous organizations that exist within the economic constraints of disruptive technologies.<br />The author does an excellent job of using examples, drawing most from the disk-drive industry.   He also includes examples from the computer, motorcycle, steel, automotive, and earth-moving industries as well.  In each case he explains how disruptive technologies emerged and often destroyed well-run companies that were following all the established rules.  This drives home the fact that disruptive technologies pose such a great risk precisely because they can destroy industries not only in spite, but because they follow established business practices.<br />After describing disruptive technologies, with historical cases to illustrate points, the author ends with a case st! udy involving electric vehicles.  I found this chapter to be among the weakest, and something of a distraction from the more substantial earlier material.  Ironically, in the  process of trying to frame electric vehicles as disruptive technology, the author seems to have missed one of the best examples of a disruptive technology, and one that nearly  destroyed America's foremost industries:  small cars.<br />Overall, Christensen's work is on a high academic level, though some of the technical material is inconsistent.  For example, the ordinates in figures 1.4, 1.5, and 6.1 disagree with each other.  The text on page 128 also disagrees with figure 6.1, while the text on page 150 disagrees with figure 7.1.  These may be simple examples of typographical errors, but they lessen confidence in the book's technical accuracy.  On the positive side, the book has excellent organization and lots ofpertinent examples, as well as extensive notes and documentation.  The index is also very co! mplete and thorough.  <br />Though Christensen's ideas are new!  and radical they are so lucid, logical, and clear that anyone involved in American business cannot afford to ignore them.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1998-08-11
US	53038410	RGW83XOM2S2RJ	0521565650	11087852	The Lighter Side of Gravity	Books	4	10	10	N	N	Gravity from A to Z	It's always a pleasure to read a well-written book authored by a leading scientist.  Such is the quality of Jayant V. Narlikar's book \\"The lighter side of gravity.\\"  One of the risks associated with writing any book on the leading edge of science, however, is that it will be obsolete almost before leaving the presses.  Narlikar's book suffers somewhat from this problem.  The book has an original publication date of 1982, and revised publication of 1996.  Consequently, it misses some recent discoveries about black holes, experimental evidence of neutrino oscillation and its implications for neutrino mass, the mass of the universe, and the nature of dark matter.<br />The book offers a nice historical perspective, from Aristotle to Galileo and on to Newton and his laws of motion and gravitation.  I particularly enjoyed the clear explanations surrounding the insight and possible clues that led Newton to the discovery of his law of gravitation.  <br />The book's promotional litera! ture presents it as a layperson's guide to gravity, but without over-simplified (and erroneous) information.  This is a high goal, and generally met, though the book's brevity might lead to some false notions.  For example, the book portrays hydrogen burning as the fusing of four protons, with a helium-nucleus byproduct, two positrons, two neutrinos, and some energy.  There is no mention of what theorists initially thought was the inadequacy of thermal energy to initiate fusion.  There is no discussion of the importance of quantum tunneling, or the formation of helium 4 in stages (two protons form deuterium, from which helium 3 is formed, and then helium 4).  Narlikar's book is not very long (only a little more than 200 pages) and could easily accommodate the extra detail.  <br />From solar models the book digresses slightly to discuss curved space, which Narlikar does very well without equations, and with the aid only of simple diagrams and examples.  There is a brief though tru! ncated discussion of supernova.  Other books such as John G! ribbin's \\"Blinded by the Light,\\" and Laurence A. Marschall's \\"The Supernova Story\\" offer far more insight for the weekend physicist.  <br />The discussion about black holes, even without the most recent discoveries, is nicely done.  As with any subject as broad as that of gravity, there are missing elements (there is no discussion of Hawking radiation, for example).  Just the same, the discussion about black holes is about as complete as a non-technical book on the subject can be.<br />Narlikar finishes his book by describing the big bang theory of cosmology, its weaknesses (some of which have been at least partially resolved since 1996) and his alternative theory of quasi-steady-state.  For the most part he has been admirably forthright about the scientific debate, with the possible exception of a closing comment in chapter 8:<br />\\"In spite of these questions regarding white holes of a limited size, astronomers have, paradoxically, given an uncritical acceptance to the hypothesis of ! the biggest white hole of them all: the Universe!\\"<br />Although one may disagree with the big-bang theory, it seems remarkable that anyone would claim it has been accepted uncritically.  Narlikar's comment seems even more remarkable since chapter 9 proceeds to describe the wealth of scientific data supporting the big-bang model.<br />Overall, however, I really enjoyed this book.  The closing chapter, though perhaps controversial, helps us understand that science is a progressive system of thought.  Even our most cherished ideas -- perhaps especially our most cherished ideas -- are subject to review and critical examination in light of the most recent experimental evidence.  If Narlikar is right about his model of the universe, we are on a threshold in cosmology.  If Narlikar is wrong, we are on a threshold in cosmology.  Either way, it's a wonderful universe.  Read Narlikar's book.  It will help you understand it a little better.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1998-07-30
US	53038410	R1ILRE017ACK2T	0385480148	528491816	Why Aren't Black Holes Black?	Books	4	12	13	N	N	A look at the frontiers of science	Some have suggested that we will see the end of science when physicists eventually develop a grand unified theory.  Robert M. Hazen and Maxine Singer disagree, and show that science is likely to be an ever-expanding sphere of inquiry and study far into the future.  The book is clear, concise, and easy to read, with a thought-provoking introduction by Stephen Jay Gould.  This is a great little book for airline flights, evenings before bedtime, or a sunny afternoon on the back deck.<br />The book is non-technical, without a single equation (though some of us may find this a disadvantage).  Subjects include cosmology, dark matter, the fate of the universe, energy, chemistry, symmetry, geology, biology, the origin of life, aging, evolution, genetics, human development, and the search for extraterrestrials.  Each section in the book provides a summary discussion of the current state of knowledge.  However, it frequently only hints at the big questions in science (though most ca! ! reful readers will be able to surmise them).  In this, the book's content is somewhat different from the description given on the cover.  Interestingly, the book never discusses why black holes are not black.<br />Generally I found the book technically correct, though often abbreviated (something that would be hard to avoid, given the book's broad scope).  Sometimes the abbreviated style leads to explanations that are potentially misleading.  For example, the discussion of the second law of thermodynamics (see page 95) is only four paragraphs.  In this short space the authors give several examples of the second law at work, concluding with the statement:<br />\\"The second law defines the direction of events in time.  Water flows downhill.  Rooms get dusty.  Supplies of fossil fuels diminish.  We grow older.\\"<br />Given a correct understanding of other circumstances, the first two examples describe the second law.  However, in each case we can find counter examples if we ignore the unmen! ! tioned conditions under which the second law applies.  Wate! r will run uphill if pushed with an electric pump.  Rooms can get less dusty if we clean them.  Supplies of fossil fuels may renew over millions of years (and lots of energy from the sun). The problem with the presentation of these examples is that the book does not adequately describe the significance of spontaneous processes and the requirement for closed systems for which the second law applies.  The second law of thermodynamics does not preclude open systems becoming more ordered, only that the overall disorder of any closed system must increase with time.<br />The example of growing older is particularly susceptible to misleading conclusions.  Aging is a poorly understood process that probably has a significant genetic component.  At any rate, our bodies are not closed systems.  We continually assimilate energy to drive our metabolic processes in order to stay alive.  Consequently, using the aging process as an example of the second law of thermodynamics is especially inappr! ! opriate in such a condensed discussion.  In a later chapter, the authors actually go into great detail describing the genetic component of aging, describing the cause(s) for aging as one of the big questions in science (see pages 230 -- 235).<br />Except for a few similar examples, however, the book does a good job of explaining the essential aspects of scientific principles and problems at a level with which most educated Americans will feel at ease.  <br />In addition to having no equations, the book also has no figures.  A few strategically placed figures would do wonders for this book, especially in the sections describing aspects of human anatomy (the brain in particular).  Even a few line drawings would help polish off the descriptions that (in the absence of drawings) are sometimes hard to follow.  Also, the book does not have an index (a big disappointment to me) so when you read it, use plenty of page markers and a bright yellow pen.  That's the only way you will be able to! !  go back later and look up any interesting material for fut! ure reference.<br />Overall, however, this was a great book and well worth the reasonable price.  I am glad I bought it and took the time to read it.   <br />Duwayne Anderson	1998-07-14
US	53038410	R25UA2NCK1MX67	0252018958	514670559	Science, Religion, and Mormon Cosmology	Books	2	27	45	N	N	A limited-scope view of Mormonism and science	Throughout Erich Robert Paul's text is the permeating influence of his perception that religion and science are fundamentally noncombative.  Many readers will find his commitment to this thesis overbearing, and often the source of error in his presentation and conclusions.<br />The promotional information claims Paul's book will become a standard reference.  However, I found it incomplete and something of a disappointment.  This is not a general book about Mormonism and science.  There is no discussion about the historicity of the Book of Mormon, or its scientific validity.  Neither is there any discussion about the historicity of the Book of Abraham, or the Book of Moses.  You will not find within its pages any discussion of the Mormon doctrine of a universal flood.  Neither will you find any mention of a literal confusion of tongues, or recent (thousands of years ago) separation of the continents. (See, for example, the January 1998 issue of _The Ensign_.)<br />Admittedly, the author explains that he has limited the scope narrowly to an examination of Mormon cosmology.  Even within this scope, however, the text is incomplete.  There is no mention, for example, of the Mormon doctrine that God created the earth in another part of the universe, and moved it to its present orbit only recently after Adam's fall.  This omission is especially surprising since the Pearl of Great Price, from which Paul draws much of his discussion, teaches this doctrine.  It was also preached by Brigham Young, and has been promoted of late by the Church's official magazine.  (See, for example, the March 1997 issue of  _The Ensign_.)<br />Paul limits his discussion of Mormon cosmology almost exclusively to the concept of \\"worlds without number,\\" and intelligent extraterrestrial life.  He paints a picture of early America with widespread public discussion about astronomical pluralism and its challenges for Christian orthodoxy.  One can almost feel the excitement of the debates and imagine the young Joseph Smith's mind racing with!  new ideas.  Reading Paul's description, we see Joseph Smith's new religion incorporating solutions not only for theological debates about baptism by immersion, but also for the latest discussions about ancient Hebrews populating the Western Continent and extraterrestrials on planets orbiting other suns.  It comes as a surprise that after describing such a clear picture of Mormonism borrowing from local debates, customs, and ideas that Paul ends the chapter by saying:<br />\\"The idea that Joseph Smith may have borrowed from cultural sources cannot, of course, be totally discounted -- or confirmed.\\" (See page 92).<br />Although Paul tries to focus strictly on aspects of Mormon cosmology, he felt obligated to discuss the church's acrimonious relationship with evolution, devoting over 20 pages to the debate.  In discussing Mormonism and evolution, however, he has provided a rather biased point of view.  This may result from his obvious association with Mormon apologists, many of whom participated in reviewing Paul's book.  It is particularly disappointing that Paul spends so little time actually examining the content of Mormon scriptures, what they mean, and how they relate to evolution.  Instead, he focuses an inordinate amount of attention upon the opinions of Mormon apologists, often to the exclusion of the public preaching of Mormon priesthood leaders, leaving the reader with a skewed view of the relationship between Mormonism and evolution.<br />Paul devotes considerable volume to discussions of four Mormon intellectuals (Orson Pratt, B.H. Roberts, John A Widtsoe, and Joseph F. Merrill) and how they dealt with their religion and its relationship with science.  However, he virtually ignores the work of Marvin and Garfield Cook, in their book \\"Science and Mormonism\\" (Salt Lake City, Deseret News Press, 1967).  This book, widely read among Mormons, attempts to reconcile science with the mostly literal, creationist-style arguments used by most Mormons.  It seems surprising that Paul mentions their views (which were!  arguably as influential as those of Pratt, Roberts, Widtsoe, and Merrill) only briefly in a terse paragraph in the bibliography.<br />Repeatedly, Paul asserts a non-literal and often ambiguous interpretation whenever Mormonism collides with science.  For example, he believes Mormonism is compatible with the idea of death before Adam's fall.  However, he never explains how to bring his view into alignment with Mormon scriptures such as 2 Nephi 2: 15, 22, which clearly state that there was no death before Adam's fall (and has been interpreted that way by Mormon prophets).  Paul does the reader a disservice by simply stating that Mormonism is compatible with evolution (something with which most Mormons would disagree) without offering a rational interpretation that brings Mormon scriptures and science into harmony.<br />Paul's apparent eagerness to accommodate Mormon theology sometimes leads him to make extreme and unsubstantiated statements.  For example, on page 157 he says:<br />\\"There is no real conflict between the Mosaic account of the creation and the nebular theory which is the most widely accepted among the prominent scientists.\\" (See page 157.)<br />In reality,  Joseph Smith taught the earth was created before the sun from the leftover components of destroyed planets.  This is in profound disagreement with modern astronomical theory which says that material thrown out by super nova, and not recycled planets, is the raw material that formed the earth.<br />The book's final chapter deals with extraterrestrials and their relationship with Mormon cosmology.  This chapter has the most science, and also deals most honestly with ideas within Mormon theology.  Although not clearly stated, Paul seems to lean toward a view of directed evolution.  The chapter on extraterrestrial life uses several tautological arguments.  For example, on page 209 Paul says:<br />\\"Therefore, the likelihood of other civilizations having already broadcast seems quite large, assuming both the existence of such civilizations and the possibility ! that they have been transmitting for long periods of time.\\"<br />Unfortunately, arguments such as these represent the rule, rather than the exception.  Overall, however, I found the book interesting and worth my while.  Though if I had it to do over again, I probably would not have purchased the book unless it was available in paperback, and 1/2 the current price.<br />Duwayne Anderson	1998-07-02
