An Insider's Guide to Managing Life Successfully with Dissociative Identity Disorder (New Horizons in Therapy)	Books	4	38	39	N	Y	A wonderful sourcebook for all people, not just those with DID	My DID clients have found this little book to be helpful, informative, and encouraging.  I think it's just the right length (about 100 pages) for the newly-diagnosed to digest early in treatment.  It was most useful for them to finally see their experiences in black-and-white, and they relished the suggestions given in the book on how to deal with alters.  For further reading I would suggest \\"Amongst Ourselves\\" by Tracy Alderman and Karen Marshall.  <br /> <br />Incidentally, the suggestions on boundaries and life skills would be helpful to everyone, DID or not.	2005-08-23

It is difficult to find anything about this book that is not...well...perfect. <br /> <br />Frank Stitt feeds our city quite nicely, thank you, and now he has made his gorgeous food available to everyone.   Frank prepares the freshest local ingredents in simple ways with touches of genius.   The photography in this volume is beautiful, and the recipes are delicious and reliable. This is also a really great read for those of you who, like myself, read cookbooks like novels.	2004-08-18

Not as well-written as I had hoped...I had to read some sentences several times to make sense of them.  Found it hard to become engaged by the characters and care about what happened to them.

I stumbled upon a well-worn copy of this little gem while vacationing at the Pudding Pan Guesthouse on the south shore of Nova Scotia.   I advise each of you to buy a copy, then rent the Pudding Pan for a week or so (902-354-4944).  Snuggle under the down comforter on the comfy loft bed, open the window (for the sea breeze), and read this book.

She gives clear, practical information and advice on how to evict emotional blackmail from your life, AND maintain a relationship with the blackmailer!<br />I have given a copy of this book to my brother, my friend, my sister-in-law, and have suggested that several clients read it.

Ms. Piercy shares with us her life - unsanitized, unpasteurized, in all its naked glory.  She does not attempt to present herself as Saint Marge, but unapologetically offers her humanity.  From her childhood in Detroit, through stints in Boston and California, then finally back to lovely Wellfleet, we see a brave, intelligent, strong woman struggling to live her life to the best of her ability.  This book is an inspiration - I recommend it heartily to all women seeking to engage fully with life. <BR>Ms. Piercy addresses the cats who have populated her life as completely as she does any of the humans.  Animal lovers will understand and appreciate the love she exudes in print for her four-legged family members.        <BR>On the negative side, she sometimes jumps around from topic to topic, a bit disjointedly...but I pretended I was having a conversation over coffee with her, and the writing style fell into place.	2002-03-26

I was expecting something more similar to his Stepsister tale, but this was, in my opinion, even better. <br />Although the diamond-patterned prince was pretty hot, I would like to have seen a little more of Elphaba's conscious embracing of her power, proud and unashamed. Can't a girl ever get away with being un-pretty and un-pleasing and un-charming? Perhaps portraying her strength would clash with his hopes of making her a sympathetic character.  Also, the author seemed to be thinking out loud about his views on religion...did he ever make up his mind?	2002-02-25

Perhaps, like Ellen Cherry Charles, Domino will reappear in the future.  Dare I hope?<BR>Between new Robbins releases, I frequently wander off chasing this or that &quot;next Tom Robbins&quot;, I have found that none of these heralded geniuses can hold the proverbial candle to my sweetie.<BR>I can't wait for your next one, Mr. Robbins (may I call you Tom?)...although I know I must.	2002-02-11

Although there were (often creepy) parallels between her experiences in North Africa and my own, as well as similarities in the lessons we have learned, I often found it hard to resonate with Ms Beattie as she told her story.  I do appreciate her analogy of spiritual growth to that of a computer game...we just keep going to higher levels.  <BR>Although I will probably never re-read this book, I will keep it in my office for my clients to borrow.

I could only read bits of this book at a sitting.  Dr. Hirigoyen equates emotional abuse with trauma.  This book is not for the timid. It is a clear-eyed, and unabashedly biased (toward the victim) look at the abusive process in varied aspects of life - the family, in business, and in the intimate relationship. Grit your teeth and read this one. It's a keeper.	2002-01-31

Lacking the charm, the clever writing, the magic, the spirituality, the sex (there was some, but it was quite machinelike), the true quirkiness.  The story was, indeed, Robbinsesque.

Ms Heyn addresses a topic that is kept quite secret in our culture - how women make the transition to what they consider to be &quot;Wives&quot;.

This is one of my favorite reads by the Kinkster and, as with so many others, it was just too short.  And, I figured out the quirk of his nemesis (one of the author's favorite ruses) immediately.  However,  Mile High Club was especially eerie since I read it soon after the World Trade Center disaster of 9/11/01.  Too bad Kinkster...more people should have read Mile High Club in time to save the twin towers.	2001-10-04

I have purchased several copies for clients and recommended the book to helping professionals and clergy.  Pulling from a variety of spiritual traditions, Wayne Muller states his thoughts clearly and tenderly, making this teaching accessible to everyone.  Read this book and &quot;become the change you want to see in the world&quot; (Gandhi).	2001-07-18
US	52603189	RIUSK6EM88EWD	0679762701	616054314	Art & Lies	Books	5	0	0	N	Y	Read with highlighter in hand	Thank you, Ms Winterson, for this beautiful journey.  It is truly extraordinary when a writer reaches into my past and puts words to emotions I've never spoken aloud.  Art &amp; Lies, while intensely personal, is also oddly easy to share.  I miss the characters, so I keep a highlighted copy on my desk and refer to it whenever I need to feel...anything. A treat for anyone who lives outside the lines.	2001-07-18

Viewing events through the eyes of different people was reminiscent of Kurasawa's Rashomon.  As a sucker for short stories, my favorite was the title piece.	2001-07-12
US	52603189	RBCET3KJB014I	1575870495	867017987	A Tribe of Warrior Women	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Buy this book	I know many of the women in this book.  They are, or were, indeed warrior women.  I have reassessed my opinion of the tenacity of the human spirit after knowing them.  Springer catches the essence of these women in her inimitable way.	2001-05-17

As usual, she manages to convey volumes in deceptively simple photographs.  This book is simultaneously incisive and oddly gentle.  A brilliant gift.	2001-05-17
US	52603189	R34CYQK4OYQIWN	0425168956	364550178	The Titian Committee (Art History Mystery)	Books	3	0	3	N	Y	I just don't care	I gave this yawner three stars simply due to the setting.  I love Venice. That,however, is where my interest in this little volume ends.  I could not bring myself to care, positively or negatively, about any of the characters.  I found myself more interested in what they ordered for lunch or dinner than in the &quot;plot&quot;.  Perhaps, to be fair, I should have read an earlier installation of the adventures of Flavia et al prior to this one. Maybe...but I think not.  I would suggest the potential reader skip this one and opt for one of the Donna Leon mysteries instead.	2001-04-16

This one doesn't tie up the loose ends to my liking.  Also, some of the animal action is just a little hard to take...even for me, a mother of 3 cats. Sorry.. not my fave.  I'd like to  see a series spin off from Riding Shotgun...	2000-04-24

US	52603189	R1NUCY55UA0DC6	0446670863	340534226	Simple Prayers	Books	5	3	5	N	N	A pearl	This beautiful little book has continued to haunt me. It took me away from my daily existence to a shimmering island peopled by characters who were not of this world, but somehow still as familiar as my neighbors, my  cousins, my mailman. Delicious.	2000-01-31
