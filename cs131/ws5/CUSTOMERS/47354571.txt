Thomas is back with another erotic journey  in The Velvet Rope. Thomas brings to life Tiffany Johnson, a street smart publicist, who decides to launch Teaz Entertainment and open a club making her the \\"Queen of Philly\\". <br /> <br />Tiffany teams up with her fianc Malik, sister Kamille, and her friend DJ Essence to open a top Philadelphia nightclub, unfortunately she finds out Malik and Kamille had an affair and may share another secret as well.  With great feelings of betrayal and vulnerability, Tiffany begins making questionable decisions which take her on an erotic journey that leads to the danger of losing her dream and her life. <br /> <br />This novel is full of notorious \\"sexcapades\\" that left this leader blushing. Unfortunately the storyline is not as hot as the sex. Tiffany's decisions do not always make sense and sometimes seem irrational. However I can say there is enough meat to keep you reading. <br /> <br />As a fan of Brenda Thomas, I still believe Threesome is her best, but The Velvet Rope would be a good read on a nothing to do lazy day. <br /> <br />Kotanya  <br />APOOO BookClub  <br />	2005-08-30

Hendrick, is described as \\"the author's journey of self- exploration . . . to  tell the story of his journey through many different aspects of love.\\" This work is broken down into four sections: The Relationship; Friends, Lovers, and Soulmates; Lost Love; and The Ultimate Form of Expression. <br /> <br />As I read through these poems I found the description, \\"the story of his journey\\" to be accurate. It read like a poetic diary of sorts--so personal to the point where I, as the reader, was left out emotionally; I was a mere observer. Although I could relate to the emotions expressed, I personally prefer poetry that is a bit more abstract and/or subtle in expression. Along with being emotionally deliberate in some of the poetry, the style seems inconsistent. In one stanza Henrick may be lyrically creative with images and  figurative language and then in the next stanza of the same poem he becomes \\"urban\\" in his language use. For example, in the poem \\"The Test\\", Hendrick expresses being able to see beyond her exterior and then a few stanzas below he is talking about whether she is \\"feeling a brotha.\\"  <br /> <br />Despite these feelings there is definitely some poetry I am vibin'. His piece called \\"Simply Beautiful\\" is very visual. He set the scene well. I also enjoyed \\"Revelation at Dawn\\".  He has some good work and ideas and I look forward to more as he grows. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Kotanya <br />APOOO Bookclub	2005-07-03

In the title story, penned by Zane, a young girl persuades her mother to leave an abusive man but things don't go as planned; J.L Woodson's \\"God Answers Prayer\\" deals with a young boy fighting for his life in the hospital after being placed there by a parent, and the recognition of abused men by Shonda Cheekes in \\"Silent Suffering\\" was a much needed perspective. However,out of the eight,there were three stories that had a greater impact on this reader. \\"The Grindstone\\" by Nane Quartay, in which a young boy witnesses a particularly gruesome murder and has no idea of how it will affect his life, \\"The Break of Dawn\\" by Collen Dixon which has an unforeseen twist that gave this reader pause and \\"The Stranger\\" by Tracy Thompson-Price who gives us a total new look at a victim's breaking point.  These three stories were written in such a way they were very compelling. <br /> <br />Zane has done an outstanding job choosing these powerful stories to show this subject matter from different perspectives. Some stories were tame in descriptions but heavy on internal struggle of the victims and others were written so vividly that you could feel the blows of the abuse. Also the inclusion of domestic abuse resources in all fifty states gives a person an idea of where to start if they could in any way relate to these stories. <br /> <br />Although this is not a book that you can sit and devour in one sitting (because of the subject matter) it is indeed a powerful read. <br /> <br />Kotanya <br />APOOO BookClub <br />  <br />  <br />	2005-05-22

This is the conflict in Allison Hobbs' Insatiable. <br /> <br />Terelle Chambers is a young single mother, who is working hard to make a home for her baby girl and her soon to be released from  jail man, Marquise. Kai Montgomery, a biracial adopted daughter of a wealthy White doctor, is a seductress and on the prowl. When Marquise comes home and gains employment where both of these women work,  these seemingly polar opposite women's worlds collide. <br /> <br />This story is a walk on the wild side. Ms. Hobbs creates two interesting characters who are more alike than they would ever admit. However, I have to say that these characters did not evoke an emotional attachment for this reader. I was simply a fly on the wall; an observer. With that said I appreciated the consistency of these characters throughout this engaging story.  This novel, full of sensational drama, is written in such a way that it is believable and somewhat shocking. I appreciated the fact that even though subject matter was off the chain, the writing was not. It was very well done. My actual rating is a 3.5. <br /> <br />With this book once it gets its claws in you, there is no letting go until the end. Ms. Hobbs has also peaked my curiosity in regards to her first book Pandora's Box and I plan to go back and read that as well. <br /> <br /> <br />Kotanya <br />APOOO BookClub <br /> <br />	2005-05-17

Mark Anthony Thomas manages to do this is in his book of poetry The Poetic Repercussion. <br /> <br />As I read this book different poems waved to me with something to say. \\"The Rib Around My Neck\\" is a man's plea/prayer for a good woman.   (Little did he know that she would be writing this review.) \\"Funny that Way\\" shows societal ironies and \\"I TOO (AFRAID I AM)\\" is reminiscent of Langston Hughes' \\"Mother to Son.\\" His poetry covers the gamut from culture to politics, spirituality (the poems have a scripture reference), education, racism and war, etc.  Brotha man has 101 poems deep! <br /> <br />I must say that this poetry is not for beginners. Some are meant to be read aloud and would work better in a performance venue while others are extremely introspective which alludes to my opening remarks. <br /> <br />If you have the heart of a poet or wish you did, pick this up. <br />Kotanya <br />APOOO BookClub	2005-05-16

He broke it down. He discussed how not to based one's choisce on faulty reasoning. Fault three especially touched me-not choosing a Historically Black College or University because there is an assumption of inferior education. Unfortunately this misconception runs rampant among those who have never bothered to investigate an HBCU. Being a graduate of one(although having not started my college career there) I knew that going was the best decision for me. And interestingly enough he mentions every friend of his that attended an HBCU has loved it. His point was not that every Black child should go to Howard, Hampton, Bennett et al, but be informed in making these kinds of choices. <br /> <br />He also is clear in pointing out that student in the title does not refer to just youth but everyone wanting to better their life. While I am not convinced his accomplishments in becoming a doctor completely qualifies him in talking about all that he takes on, his advice seems sound. Along with that advice he shares personal experiences as well as the wisdom that was shared with him by others. <br /> <br />Overall I think that this book is ideal for the student who is unsure of what to do but open to the possibilities. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Kotanya <br />APOOO BookClub <br /> <br />	2005-04-25

Leila , the wild child Latina, is approached by the super producer of Explicit Content G Double D, to go solo. She jumps at the chance leaving her friend Cassie, more grounded Black girl, high and dry. Cassie, feeling betrayed, decides to still pursue her thang, albeit a bit differently. After a hip hop contest she confronts G Double D asking why he didn't want her. After hearing what he had to say she decided to do it on her own. However a few days later the same producer steps up and offers a deal too good to turn down and manages to pull her into the Explicit Content family. Once she's in she realizes music ain't the only thing she has to be down for. <br /> <br />Following the story of Cassie and Leila had this sista up at 3:00 a.m. finishing the book and writing this review.

Soon after, Alana, a recently laid off journalist and with hopes of jump starting her stalled career, goes undercover to expose a conspiracy within the company her sister works. However, when she reached Orlando there was no way that she could have known that the mysterious man from the airport would become an object of desire. This all takes place in Alice Wootson's Kindred Spirits. <br /> <br />Keith, a former military specialist, was in Orlando investigating the same conspiracy when he spotted Alana in disguise. Catching her snooping he managed to prevent her from being caught. Eventually they become partners in trying to discover who is responsible. While Alana is open to love, Keith tries hard to fight his attraction and both are unsure where this all will lead. <br /> <br />Kindred Spirits in the traditional sense of any romance shows two sexy people who have enough sexual tension to scorch the paper the words are written on. There also is a great amount suspense. Unfortunately for this reader, I had to wait a while to get to the romance. Keith and Alana do not have a conversation until the eleventh chapter in the book. Because of this delay their love journey seemed rushed.

Cienna Turner, a beautiful single lawyer who is always getting hit on,  and Keith Page, a handsome and sexy man who has no problems getting women,  were assigned to work on a sexual harassment case together. This case proved to be a challenge because the client was a friend of their boss. In addition,  they had an overwhelming attraction to each other. As they began working on this complicated case their attraction threatened to complicate things more. However, when the client makes a pass at Cienna the complications began rolling towards a situation that made things down right impossible. <br />Ms. Arthur develops two sexy likable characters in Cienna and Kieth.

Within the harassment case there were many twist and turns with an interesting surprise.

Terrence O'Neal is the police detective that is lead investigator but the only thing he seems to want to investigate is whether Denise is feeling the magnetism he is. And she is. All of this romance and intrigue is wrapped up in Swanzetta Smith's debut novel, Private Passions. <br />Denise's regular morning ritual being interrupted by subtle things that most people shake off was a great way of capturing this reader's interest. As the story unfolds the characters are revealed as real and relatable. The chemistry between Denise and Terrence is carefully crafted with just enough tension to make you as frustrated as they. However their emotional ties move from zero to love in 2.5 seconds. That was too quick for this reader. The story played like a typical intrigue romance with little to no variation from the formula and depending on what you want that is not a bad thing.<br />Private Passions is an easy entertaining read and definitely leaves room open for a sequel with a couple of other characters.

Shots ring out hitting both women- Kali survives but Betty dies only having said, \\"have faith.\\" Kali soon learns that finding out who shot her, killed Betty, and why Betty called her in the first place is going to be much more complicated than sharing with local police what she remembered.<br />This mystery moves at a deliberate and methodical pace exposing clues in this case as well as an eight-year-old case involving the disappearance and assumed death of Betty's niece Faith. Kali must use a great deal of intuition and lawyer reasoning to put the clues together. With the main focus being from the perspective of a lawyer the story does not lend itself to a lot of action and excitement. It definitely is a search and discovery process. Kali runs back and forth from the Bay Area to Lake Tahoe and even takes a trip to Las Vegas. This approach stays true to what this reader would imagine would be the situations and limitations of lawyers.<br />Ms. Jacobs is very clever in the way the clues are revealed and does a wonderful job of weaving together the sub-plots-local police investigation, Bay area investigations, and the killer's search to complete their job-into the body of the main story. However the revelation of the killer and motives were anticlimactic and predictable for this reader.

Kenneth has been unfaithful to Elizabeth, something he seemingly got from his father. And Elizabeth is a Prime A B****, which was one of the things that sent Kenneth into the arms of another. Nina is a naive young thing that gets involved with Isaac, a heartless cold drug dealer. When she realizes that she needs to get out of the lifestyle that she created with him, she finds that he is not going to just let her leave. In this story both of these couples hit road bumps that are definitely relationship wreckers but will they allow the grace of God to make the difference in their lives?<br />Vanessa Miller tells an engaging realistic story of how people respond when they are hurt and bitter. How they lash out and do things that you cannot take back and always regret. However once she introduces God into the lives of these people, the dramatic fiction takes a backseat to scriptures, sermons, and bible lessons. The excessive use of these elements distracted from the story and everything that was played out in the dramatic seemed to be laid out in the scripture or in a &quot;Christian&quot; explanation. The reader is even subjected to that actual voice of God giving direction and a visit to hell. Despite these things, I appreciated the story and the storytelling. The ending was a real stretch that fit like an afterthought, although it may play a part in the anticipation of the sequel in the planned Rain trilogy. <br />I would recommend this book to other Christians and those who are open to Christianity.

Leron is an aspiring author who pays the bills by installing security systems. Michelle is a career minded woman in advertising with a fiancé that she is unsure of. After literally bumping into each other, they would have never known that their lives would somehow be destined to intertwine in Michael T. Owens', Pick Up Lines.<br />Like any other weekend, Leron goes to the club to pick up women. After a few drinks he gives his number to a young woman named Anesia. The following weekend his boys stand him up but Anesia calls and Leron makes the split second decision to spend some time. He realizes he must have drunk more than he thought because she is nothing that he remembers. Despite not really being attracted to her, he sleeps with her anyway. Michelle gets ready for a night out with her fiancé only to find out that he plans to work all night. Frustrated with his neglect of her and her feelings she kicks him out and questions whether marrying him would be the right thing to do. Eventually Leron and Michelle hook up and we experience more twists and turns than a boardwalk pretzel.<br />Mr. Owens has a definite flair for the dramatic. Six degrees (or less) of separation is not wasted in this tale of typical twenty-something drama, where nothing is off limits. This book is full of witty dialogue and conversation that will have book clubs talking way into the night. However, for this reader these characters become instantly predictable and then take a sharp turn into people we don't recognize making the resolution of the storylines unbelievable. <br />If you want a quick, drama filled read, pick up Pick Up Lines.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-09-28

In Alicia Wiggins Someone to Love, Claudia Ryland and Ray Elliott are best friends. Claudia, tired of being a bridesmaid and never a bride, sets out to implement a plan to find Mr. Right. It is not until Mark, a man that meets all of Claudia's requirements, comes into the picture that Ray soon realizes he loves Claudia and sets out to prove that he is Mr. Right. <br />Ms. Wiggins has created an interesting story based on how real friendships between a man and a woman can lead to love. Claudia and Ray's friendship as well as the creation of sexual tension was well developed. Also the development of the importance of family was a definite theme that was well done. However, I was disappointed with the sub-plot involving Ray's ex-fiancé. She was brought in to be a distraction to Ray and I found the details of her life, beyond those that directly affect Ray, were not needed. The author also created a triangle (Mark, Claudia, and Ray) in which either man could have been chosen and the reader would have been ok with it. Because there was not a clear \\"hero\\", it resulted in over-the-top drama used to expedite an anti-climatic and predictable decision thus taking away from the suspense of whom she will choose. <br />Someone to Love is under Genesis Press' Indigo Imprint, which proclaims \\"elegantly woven love stories with intriguing plots intertwine the nuances of African-American culture, bringing to light the fantasy of true romance with characters of depth, intrigue and seduction.\\" Despite this reader's misgivings this novel delivers that and is a recommendable read.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO Bookclub	2003-08-26

Lucky for them they end up on the same airplane to Tahiti. Within hours they share a kiss. Melanie, shocked she was being so \\"fast\\", is relieved to know that when they reach their destination, Winston will be in a doctor's conference and she will be cruising the Tahitian islands. When Winston pops up on the cruise ship kissing her once again, she knows she is in trouble. Winston's chase becomes relentless and he pulls out all the stops to spend time with Melanie. However, as things are heating up, Winston is holding a secret that can get in the way of this new love.<br />Dorothy Elizabeth Love has written one of the sexiest, exciting, and laugh- out- loud romance stories that I have read in a long time. Loves scenes with Winston and Melanie will have you panting and the scenes with Melanie and her best friend Sandra will have you in stitches. The only thing that keeps this from being a five for me on my romance scale is the ending. It was a bit anti-climatic. If you are a romance reader pick this up.

Malik Greene is a \\"playa-playa\\" executive who immediately assumes that all women want him, including Shari. Shari's heart is not available for any man since the death of her fiancé. When Malik lays his charm on she rebuffs him making him to become increasingly intrigued. It is not until Shari's memory of her fiancé slips off the pedestal that she had placed him on, that she decides to give Malik a chance. Unfortunately a sexual harassment lawsuit is filed against Malik that has the potential to ruin their relationship before it even gets started.<br />I enjoyed the romance in this story. Shari and Malik genuinely develop a friendship. As a result of that friendship their relationship was a refreshing spin of honesty and support between these characters. Unfortunately, sometimes without the conflict of lies and deceit, it lends to a less dramatic storyline. The sexual harassment aspect of the storyline began with great potential for conflict but fizzled out and left this reader disappointed. Also each character had issues with their parents that offered great potential with powerful situations and scenes. However the resolution of these complex relationships left me unsatisfied. A fan of character driven stories will enjoy this romance.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO Bookclub	2003-07-04

This is made evident in Kimberley White's contemporary romance Acquisitions.<br />Akira Reed was working late at the office when she heard a strange sound outside her door. When she rushed out of her office she ran into her boss who noticed that she was rattled and used this opportunity to sexually harass her. When she filed charges she found herself not only in the company of Roman Miller, the attorney assigned to investigate the sexual harassment claim, but eventually implicated in the theft of a miracle cure. Roman Miller never knew what hit him when Akira walked into his office. His mind quickly left business when he looked into her eyes. Soon they both find themselves in a passionate relationship that is tested by deception, harassment, misdeed and misconduct.<br />This is an engaging story with refreshing lovely characters. Akira is a \\"woman of size\\" and the role it plays in this story is so real. She relates to Roman, an extremely attractive man, with her physical insecurities. Roman is a man that is complex yet very simple making him extremely attractive. Their roller coaster relationship jumps track due to these complexities and for this reader they don't all play well into the story. His issues with his parents are explained but its connection with the rest of the story seemed a bit manufactured. Nonetheless the romance was wonderful and the erotic, passionate, and real lovemaking heated the pages. This is a definite lazy afternoon read.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO Bookclub	2003-07-01

Patricia is the first person Mary Ann meets and she decides that she will be the one to guide Mary Ann on the ends and outs of law school and D.C. Patricia has a sense about Mary Ann that she may be interested in her local investment club and invites her to a meeting. But this is no ordinary investment club and the members are not too particular about strangers coming in.  It is at this meeting Mary Ann is introduced to Olive. Though their first meeting was not a good one, Olive eventually leads Mary Ann to a form of liberation-sexual liberation. This is Mary Ann's introduction to The Sisters of APF.<br />This book was interesting for much more than the raw in your face sex, which is a part of it, but because it clearly tracks a woman's sexual emancipation. Everyone who has been to college knows of that one girl who gets away from their parents and gets buck wild. Mary Ann is that girl. Whether you agree with Mary Ann's decisions or not it was fascinating watching her step out of her comfort zone and increasingly takes risks. Zane even included a scene of discovery in a place called \\"Heaven\\" that was reminiscent of a scene in the movie Trois 2. <br />I grew somewhat wary of the slang usage especially with professional women and there was not a great point of climax for me in the novel.

It is love at first contact in Lisa G. Riley's novel, At Last.<br />Caroline and Brian begin their relationship on the fast track. Within the first few pages we have a couple that are overwhelmed by each other. That intensity between strangers was a bit overwhelming for this reader. As the story progresses, they find themselves fighting their attraction trying to avoid a romance in the workplace defending their interracial relationship, and trying to protect Caroline from a psychopath she doesn't even know. Throw in a crazed ex-girlfriend and you have a lot going on in this book. <br />Ms. Riley literally has this book set in three parts. Although this allows her to pretty much develop each major dilemma they face, I would have rather had the romance and intrigue unfold together. However, she does an awesome job of noting the issues of race without ignoring them or bombarding her reader.

What would it be like if sex was no longer for pleasure but for survival? Oh my! Most people cannot even imagine, but Gary Hardwick (author of Color of Justice) has imagined this kind of world in his novel, Sex Life as a. a. Clifford.<br />This futuristic novel takes place in First City, 2268 A.D. Where the world is considered a social Utopia: a place where intellect, talent, beauty are the prize of the day and technology has advanced to a level where there is no poverty and crime . . . and no sex for pleasure.<br />A disease called CMB has destroyed the connection between sex and pleasure by turning sexual intimacy into a biological function of survival. Now people must have sex five times a day or they will die and all pleasure in the act of sex no longer exist.<br />Joe, a resident of First City has a survival sexual encounter with a mysterious woman named Vella with whom he experiences miraculous pleasure. These feelings take them on a journey that not only affects them but the world around them.<br />The premise of this story was so captivating that I knew I would read this book. Clifford painstakingly sets up this society and introduces ideas that no one would ever think of or would ever want to. As a reader I was amazed at the thought and detail that was put into this novel. However, because of the much-needed set up, the story moves slowly. Joe is also written to be very reflective on his life which tends to drag the story as well. <br />Those who are interested by an alternate universe will find it completely fascinating. You will also be able to appreciate the believability of the social structure. I would recommend this read to someone looking for something a little different and with a lot of patience.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-05-09

Jay Luke Wind Dancer is Navajo Indian who loved across cultural barriers and was burned. Now he's determined to never cross the line again.<BR> <BR>This book had great characters that were complex and had many layers, however over three quarters of the book was focused on their individual issues thus belaboring the story. Although this book is described as a mainstream novel, the romance between Cameron and Luke was a central part of the book. Unfortunately I saw no real chemistry between them and their actual &quot;hook-up&quot; didn't occur until late in the story. I did, however, enjoy the subplot with Luke's nephew. There were a few twists and turns but they were unexciting and some were included simply to move the story in a specific direction.<BR> <BR>I completed this book because I kept waiting for it to draw me in. It initially captured my attention with the great amount information regarding Navajo Indians; however the book fell short on exploring Samoan culture, both being a major influence on the story.

She gives the reader a picture of their life being perfect with their eleven children (Four from a previous marriage of her mother's) and a good marriage. Her father loved his wife and children dearly and did well for them. However, as her mother began to establish herself in a political career it became increasingly difficult for her father to live with her divided attention. He would eventually splinter the family by murdering his wife and then killing himself. From that point Dr. Coley discusses the way she survived the ordeal.<br />As I read this book, I noticed it spoke of mostly good times in her childhood home up until her parent's death. She also, in describing her parents and events in her life, would offer psychological, sociological, and theological explanations of events happening. This made me somewhat skeptical of the portrayal of her parents because they could be misconstrued as excuses. She moved quickly through her story. When the tragedy was mentioned it was merely snuggled in one paragraph, which made it clear that it was not her point of emphasis. The majority of the book focused on her ministries and the things she learned growing up. She also includes \\"Lessons for Living\\" devotions at the end.<br />I have a great admiration for Dr. Coley. Her ability to rise above the tragedy and trust in God is truly inspiring. However her book reads like a long testimony or sermon. Her life story is more like antidotes baring testimony to what God can do. This would be something that I much rather listen to then read.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-03-29

When Walter Mosley let loose another round with Easy I was there to pick up the pieces; Six Easy Pieces.<br />Six Easy Pieces is a book of seven different stories reminding fans of who Ezekiel Rawlins is (as if we had forgotten) and what he does that makes us love him so. Mosley shows us a forty-four year old man who over time has become a senior janitor at Sojourner Truth Junior High School, a property owner, the father of two, and the lover of one.  Despite all of that, each story has a friend needing his help and in spite of himself Easy ends up in the middle of all the action. <br />Mr. Mosley moves Easy easily through the city of Los Angeles and the rest of Southern California. He is involved with a little bit of everyone doing a little bit of everything. In the story Smoke, Easy investigates arson at his school, in Crimson Stain he investigates the death of a prostitute who found religion, in Lavender he is chasing after a Black boy with his nose wide open behind a flirtatious rich White girl, and in Gray Eyed-Death his past comes bursting back on the scene with a vengeance. These are just four of the seven exciting stories.<br />Easy Rawlins fans will enjoy this book because Mosley gives you small pieces of Easy and his friends in well told stories and good pacing to keep you reading until the end. This is especially good for those who want to satisfy a small itch but have limited time to read a whole Easy Rawlins Mystery. Those who haven't read Easy Rawlins Mysteries before will get recaps to bring you up to speed but will probably find yourself needing to read the other books to get a complete picture.

The reality is we know less and the only one that knows all is God. Through the Storm by Sha' Givens is a novel about two young women who find that the very thing that they are running from is the very thing that they need.<br />Mahogany Malone and Jennifer Jones are best friends. They are bright, young, and beautiful, and think that they have everything under control until life throws a curve ball.  Mahogany desperately wants to escape an overbearing religious mother who does everything in her power to protect her. As a teenager, one big mistake sends her on a path that not even her mother can save her from. Jennifer as a teenager has already hardened her heart to love as a result of a horrible incident and pathetic relationship with her mother. The two girls lost contact after Mahogany went to college but a phone call informing Mahogany that Jennifer was in the hospital brought them back together. At this point one begins to change and the other is left standing on the outside looking in. The only link is Mahogany's mother, \\"Momma\\" Malone.<br />This is a story that is full of life's lessons and what God can do. The encounters that each young lady has throughout are situations that anyone reading it could relate to directly or indirectly. Unfortunately the storytelling was deliberate in evoking emotions (I prefer it to be more subtle) and read somewhat like a Christian tract. While as a Christian I have no problem with that, some might find it a bit preachy. Through the Storm would be a great conversation starter for individuals who you know are headed to the land of nowhere because the message is clear: Isaiah 40:31. It was an easy read and I recommend it.	2003-03-04

Since I haven't read her first book, Like Boogie on Tuesday, this was my first time reading this author. I thought the book was well written and it held my interest.

I wanted to savor the idiosyncrasies of budding love and excitement that moves with suspense. Ms. Harris' subplots (Alexandra's mother and Chase's new employee) were a bit underdeveloped. Because of this I felt the book was over before it actually ended. I also found some of the dialogue stilted. For example Alexandra quite often found herself in conversations where she would often reply \\"touché.\\" <br />Nonetheless, I enjoyed the jet set lifestyle that Chase lived and lavished on Alexandra.

His stories are not only clever and entertaining but they require that you think while reading. He really challenges himself in his writing with word choices and word play. In his story  \\"A Guest\\", he tells one story in short simple sentences that all begin with \\"A\\". His story \\"The Break-up Ceremony\\" (which I suggested that a friend put in an anthology he created for his writing class) is an interesting view of a public ceremony announcing the break up of a relationship. This was one of the best stories in the collection.<br />My angst with this collection of stories is he strays from prose into listings. Although they are appropriate for his thematic scheme, I felt they took away from the flow of the book. Also some of his stories have so many layers that re-reading may be necessary (but I guess that is not always a bad thing). My true rating would be a 4.5 but since halves are not offered I do not feel it generous to give it a five. This is a highly recommended read.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-01-06

Mr. Morris opens his novel with a weak-minded half-crazed man who enlisted in the Peace Corp, giving up a lucrative career in engineering, after a seemingly harmless college incident. His split second decision changes his life more than he ever expected by literally falling into Beinin, a hidden Utopia in Africa. It is here where he goes through a mental, spiritual, and physical transformation. He is no longer a weak man run off by pranks of adolescences, but an assured man with a definite purpose. He eventually emerges from the secret world ready to take on the evils of this world; racism, greed, and governmental corruptions. Along the way he picks up a cub, a best friend, and a love.<br />ZON is a mish mash of wonderment and confusion. Mr. Morris contains the reader inside of ZON's head for a great deal of time in this novel. The details and description of life in Beinin made it difficult for this reader to get into this novel initially. However, once ZON leaves Beinin, the book begins to move. ZON's interactions with militia men, racists in a small town, Wall Street, and ultimately the American government draws the reader in rooting for good verses evil. Additionally my enjoyment increased as I discussed the novel (and there is plenty to discuss).<br />If you are a reader who loves detailed explanations of how people are created before you are exposed to their purpose this most definitely is a book you do not want to miss. If this description doesn't really speak to your taste, I challenge you to try something new and pick it up. This is a book I would have never read but glad I did.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO BOOKCLUB	2003-01-01

In this four hundred page comprehensive guide, she covers information from a student's motivation to enter into law school to different truths about law school.<br />Beginning with her personal experience, Ms. Mitchell gives testimony to the difficulty of law school and the necessity of this guide especially for African Americans. Brick by brick she constructs the detailed steps from the question \\"Do you really want to Go to Law School?,  to an appendix that includes other references, Black Law school profiles, needed checklists, and more.<br />As a person who considered law after receiving my degree, I picked this text up with anticipated interest. Initially intimidated by its many pages and small font I was impressed with the enormous amount of information. Ms. Mitchell wonderfully anticipated that reaction and created a \\"straight out\\" outline designed for easier reading. This outline lays out the main points of each chapter so that the reader can utilize this guide as a reference guide<br />Ms. Mitchell's organization of this book is probably the most impressive thing about the book. As stated before the outline is a definite plus and the appendix was full of such great information that realistically it could have been a book unto itself. Although there are testaments of its success included in the book, Ms. Mitchell does include a disclaimer that everyone's experience will be varied and this book was designed simply as an aide. However I cannot imagine how a guide this well put together could be anything but helpful.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO BookClub	2003-01-01

This is the story of Marshall Coates, star football player, Kennedy James, a beautiful art dealer, and the people who weave in and out of their lives. Marshall is the man on campus and Jasmine is his girlfriend, but his reaction to a tragedy inadvertently jeopardizes their relationship. Kennedy is involved with a man who is everything that she thinks she should have and everything that she does not need (or want). Eventually these lives will connect through people and predicaments. <br />Mr. McGlothin's creation of wonderfully vivid characters is the glue of this story. The characters in this book interact with each other, react to each other, and then are ultimately forced to respond to life and its unpredictability. We discover that although Marshall and Kennedy do not have a personal relationship in the story Mr. McGlothin definitely utilizes the six degrees of separation phenomenon (although he didn't use all six). With all these vines twisted in the tree of life he tells the story that life and love isn't always fair. <BR> <BR>This book was engaging. The characters and their issues were real and their story well told. There were bits of over the top high drama but I must admit these are the parts that had me talking to the book. Also some character reactions I felt didn't go with his writing of their personality and as a result the ending seemed a bit too neat considering the storyline. Despite that foible Autumn Leaves; Loves so Deep is a book that I would recommend.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO Bookclub	2002-12-29

What do four women and &quot;Jo-Jo&quot;, an ex-cop, and the Love Goddess all have in common? Love Potions by Leslie Esdaile.<br />Four women (Nikki, Victoria, Delores, Gail) all friends, and all finding themselves in the need for cash, decide to throw a few psychic-reading parties. For authenticity they develop a love potion elixir to sell to the clientele.  Nicole Gordon is the resident &quot;psychic&quot; and Adam Bastille, an ex-cop private eye, comes in for a reading from Nicole trying to find out information on a case. He ends up walking out with a special elixir that has him falling head over heels for Nicole.  Fortunately for Adam, Nicole didn't need the elixir for her to fall in love with him.<br />This book is filled with so many different things (even a bit of mystery) that the romance of the main characters, Nicole and Adam, can and did get lost in the shuffle. However, the parties, &quot;Jo-Jo&quot;, and the effects of the elixir made for funny situations and plenty of romance for the others. It is necessary that I mention one particular intimate scene between Nicole and Adam that is out of this world. (I read that scene twice) Despite some of the choppiness in the romance storyline, this book would be a good read on a lazy afternoon.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO Bookclub	2002-12-04

Easy is Back!<br />Brawley Brown is missing and Easy Rawlins is hired to find him. It seems so simple but if you know Easy like I know Easy, nothing is ever that simple. So now Easy is back in \\"Bad Boy Brawley Brown.\\" by Walter E. Mosley.<br />After the death of Easy's partner and the entrance of a new love interest, Easy is working hard and fighting demons. When his friend John calls him and asks for a favor, Easy is a bit hesitant but agrees because John was a long time friend. He was asked to find John's wife's son, Brawley. It seems simple enough but after Easy finds Brawley's father lying dead in the doorway of his aunt's house it goes down hill from there. Taking place on the streets of Los Angles during the 1960's, Easy finds himself in the midst of a Black Revolution, the mafia, and we all know that the police at that time were no real friends to the \\"Negro\\". Easy relies heavily on his quick wit and knowledge of the streets to look for Brawley, leading him to solve crimes that he had no intention of knowing about, and saving his own life in the process.<br />Bad Boy Brawley Brown shows us an older Easy that still has all of his instincts but is carrying even more burdens. The absence of \\"Mouse\\" is evident throughout the book and as a result it seemed to move a bit slower. I still found myself wrapped up in the storyline and Mr. Mosley has a way of adding elements that really give you an idea of the shady kind of people that Easy always deals with. Despite those few exceptions, I have to say over all I enjoyed it. As a person who has read all of the Easy Rawlins mysteries, except for two (and they are sitting right next to me waiting to be read), I am excited that Easy is back.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO Bookclub	2002-12-04

Oh How Fun!<br />Blackgentleman.com is a short anthology presented to us by Zane, the author of Addicted, The Heatseekers, and The Sex Chronicles I and II. She and three other authors, Shonda Cheekes, J.D. Mason, and Eileen M. Johnson, bring us four very different stories that are all linked by the internet site Blackgentlemen. com. (Which incidentally is a real site.)<br />Zane, known for her racy sexual antics in her stories, presents five stories (the first and the last story written by her) that show five different experiences of women who meet men on this website. The first story Duplicity shows us how much twins actually do share. Lesson Learned, penned by Ms Cheekes shows us how something built on lies will soon crumble. Your Message Sent, penned by J.D. Mason, shows us that even though the Internet is readily available, it is still a tool of mystery. The Adventures of the Bold and Bourgeois, penned by Ms. Johnson, shares with us how we can miss what is good for us in our quest for perfection. And Delusions show us that things are not always what they seem.<br />I read this and was pleasantly surprised. I did not have a great expectation one way or the other but I had fun reading it. The stories are fun and entertaining and in classic Zane style we do experience the pleasures of the flesh as well as a twist in her stories. Do not pick this up expecting a literary work that will be destined for greatness because you will be disappointed. If you are in for something light, entertaining, a little sexy, or quirky, some romance and even a bit of suspense you might want to check it out.<br />	2002-12-04

Men, money, and self-destructive behavior aids in her hurricane funnel and one could never predict where it would touch down. Walking through Sasha's life as an observer, I found myself talking to her the whole time, but she never listened. <br />Brenda L Thomas tells a fascinating tale of a woman who struggles through life making poor choices that have heartbreaking consequences in this 138 pg. novel. This book grabbed my attention from the beginning and didn't let go until she was through with me. I appreciated the narrative of different points of views and the tact that was used in racy sex scenes. This was a quick and easy read. My only disappointment came at the end, whereas a reader, I recognized it couldn't have possibly ended any other way but I still wanted something more.

If you said a newspaper you would be wrong. It is Crossing The Line, a novel by Laura Castoro. Black is the color of his skin, White is the color of hers and Red is the color of their love.<br />In Crossing The Line, Ms. Castoro introduces us to Thea Morgan, a fair skinned Black woman, who could easily pass for White and made the choice to marry White. All was right in her world until her husband dies and leaves her with a teenage daughter to raise.  At her sister's wedding she finds herself in the company of her first love, Xavier Thorton, an All American football player, affluent and prominent minister, and a dark skinned African American. Realizing she is still drawn to him, and he to her, causes her to have face some unresolved issues of the past that she thought were all behind her and introducing new ones that she wasn't ready for.<br />This book quickly gained my attention and moved at a pace that kept me reading. Ms. Castoro's ability to develop characters is highlighted in Xavier's and Thea's complex personalities showing their many layers; the prominent layer for Thea being a Black woman with White skin and that for Xavier being an ex-football player now prominent minister. Ms. Castoro creatively wove together an intricate past for these characters with what proved to be an overwhelming present.  <br />Although I enjoyed reading this novel, I felt that there were some situations that were left undeveloped and I had unanswered questions. I was also a bit disappointed that the line that was crossed (noting the title) was not the primary aspect of the story.

Black Funk: void of light and containing the smell of fear, perpetuated by a peculiar fascination and is said to have been manifested out of the oppressive African American history. So sets the stage to Michael Presley's Blackfunk series.<br />In Blackfunk I, we were introduced to a social worker named Andria Jackson who has been cheated on and lied to and who had just about given up on men and herself. She meets lawyer Rashaun Jones, who himself has issues with women and finds difficulty in trusting. As they maneuver their way through their relationship a tragedy appropriately named Blackfunk occurs changing the course of their lives and their love.<br />Enter in Blackfunk II, where we find that their road, though still being travels together, gets no easier for this couple. Rashaun is in the court case of his life defending one of his best friends. His client's sister is in active pursuit ignoring the fact that he is with Andria and with that not being enough, he is forced to face his ex-girlfriend, the one woman that changed his life forever, in the courtroom. Andria, also having her cross to bear, faces serious health issues that could have an effect on their relationship, she struggles to deal with her friends' indiscretions, infidelities, and ultimate death, and her ex- boyfriend seeming will do anything to get her back. This is the perfect stage for all the drama to unfold.<br />Michael Presley has an amazing way of telling a story that is in your face and wild.  This sequel picked up where he left off in Blackfunk I and kept it coming.  The language is raw and the situations are over the top but not unrealistic. However unlike the first one, he seemingly tried to incorporate a number of themes in this and in some places there was an obvious change of focus that interrupted the flow. However, although I like Blackfunk better, I have no problem recommending this book to those who are strong in mind and disposition because make no mistake, Blackfunk II ain't nojoke.<br />Kotanya<BR>APOOO	2002-09-19

When one carries their own burdens they weigh heavily; but when the burdens are not your own they change your life. Carmen Taylor has designated herself the official burden carrier for all, however when she runs to her friend Desiree's rescue again, she finds this just may be the one burden that she's gonna have to lay down.<br />Gonna Lay Down My Burdens is a complex story of love, loyalty and loss. Carmen Taylor, from the time she was thirteen years old, has found herself bound to people in friendship out of a strange sense of obligation and loyalty. Throughout the story, with every show of loyalty, there is a loss and she constantly  reaches right down and bears one more cross. The one other constant for Carmen is her love for Chester Sheffield and her inability to have him. Whether it's because at the time he wasn't interested in her, she was pushing him away or her best friend decided she wanted him, Carmen seemed to be on the outside looking in.<br />Ms. Monroe portrays a stunning picture of how children (like Carmen) can take on responsibilities that are not theirs to bear and will carry that habit into adulthood. She also paints a very clear picture of how people will take advantage of the burden bearers in their life and Desiree, Burl, and all of Carmen's burden ridden friends do just this. <br />This book was a bit difficult for me to get started, but once I did, I was hooked. It moved at a steady pace and Ms. Monroe has a way of walking through a person's life and giving you insight to all of their idiosyncrasies without loading down the reader with mundane details. I became so involved with the story that I talked to the characters with warnings and reprimands. I even became frustrated to the point I wanted to put the book down, but Ms. Monroe's gift of storytelling is made evident in that no matter how you feel about what is going on in the story you have to know how it ends. This is a really good read.<br />Kotanya <BR>APOOO BookClub	2002-09-16

She explores everything from the sensuous play of one on one to the burning heat of a ménage a tois.<br />In the second half of the book, Montana Blue`s IMPULSE, takes the reader on a sexual odyssey started by two people who barely know each other's name but on an impulse soon discover the more intimate details of their personalities. <br />In our bookclub discussion we agreed that the stories were hot and best not read alone. Some of the women were turned off by some of the sexual content of the short stories but everyone agreed that Impulse by Montana Blue was off the chain!<br />One can debate the purpose of erotica and, depending on whatever side you fall, it will aid you in what you believe this rating could be. If you think the purpose of erotica is to simply turn your body on, then you will rate this a high. If you think it's purpose is to turn on your imagination, then again I say that you will rate this high. It does both.  Not every fantasy shared in this book of erotica will tickle everyone's fancy, but it is almost a guarantee that something will.

He comes to Chelsea to escape life defined by race, as he had known it to be, and to pursue excellence and comfort in the ideas and standards of the ancient philosophers of Rome and the traditions of Chelsea. Rashid Bryson, a fourteen year-old boy from New York City comes into an unfamiliar environment of Chelsea with fear and a heavy heart looking to Mr. Washington as a possible salvation. Jana Hansen is a new teacher at Chelsea who has seemingly taken an interest in both Jerome and Rashid; Jerome as a potential mate and Rashid as a student with potential. As they get to know each other all three soon find out when one is in unfamiliar territory one should have no expectations. Their journey together is plagued with certain expectations misdirected in the midst of their own personal losses. When their issues lead up to a powerful, and anticipated confrontation we find that the results are unexpected but ultimately not surprising. <BR>  <BR>  This book is complex and layered. There are so many things that could be discussed that one review couldn't cover it all.

Some would argue that accomplishment alone could justify its classic status. However I assure you that tidbit of information is more of an extra piece cake in the seven course feast of \\"Their Eyes Were Watching God.\\"<br />Zora Neal Hurston, a renown author and anthropologist, wrote this book in 1937 and included all of her knowledge of Southern heritage, the influence of her travels, and her experience living as a woman. Hurston molds a tale of a journey that far too many African Americans have seen or heard in their lifetime or through the oral tales of their family.<br />Our protagonist, Janie, sits and shares with her Friend Phoeby a remarkable story of life and growth. She bares her soul like as if, what one author wrote,  \\"there is no agony like bearing an untold story inside you.\\" She explained in painstaking detail how at the direction of her grandmother her life followed a path she would have never chosen herself albeit she most undoubtedly would never change. She began her journey bound by the expectation of others and ends it with her own personal freedom; freedom of heart, body, and soul. <br />This book is vividly written and has captured the essence of the people in those places at that time.  Ms. Hurston painted a picture and added sound with dialect. She made you feel as if Janie were telling the story directly to you rather than Phoeby. Through Janie's reflections this reader concluded that just about the whole time her eyes were in fact watching God as he guided her through all aspects of life allowing her to remain a victor under horrible circumstances and learning to be content in her on skin.<br />Our book club highly recommends this book. However to get its' full impact its best to have someone to discuss it with while or after you read it.	2002-06-30

The way he was looking at me, making me feel like I was something good to eat, I should have known he was up to something nasty even then.\\" <br />This musing of a reflective Annette Goode begins the story of a young girl harboring a poor self image and hurtful secret and the unlikely friendship that she finds comfort in.<br />Mary Monroe's God Don't Like Ugly is the tale of Annette, a young woman struggling to find herself and who has experienced a great deal of loss on many levels. Out of the ashes comes her phoenix, Rhoda. Rhoda, a rebellious young girl, is everything that Annette isn't. Recognizing this, Rhoda is bound and determined to be Annette's friend and she takes her role as savior and defender very seriously. As their relationship grows Annette finds what she believes is true friendship and when she confides in Rhoda her terrible secret she finds true acceptance. It is not until they both reach adulthood that Annette finds out that both came with a price.<br />Ms. Monroe tells a bothersome yet beautiful story. She weaves a basket full of lies, deceit, abuse, and retribution, all disguised in colorful cellophane of love and a red bow of friendship. This book was truly awesome. Ms. Monroe has a wonderful ability to tell a powerful story and giving life to interesting and sometimes amusing characters. She kept this reader's attention the whole time. <br />I had this book for about six months before I read it. After I finished I didn't understand what had taken me so long. Some parts of the books may leave you questioning and in disbelief, but when you stop to think about it isn't that exactly what life does sometimes?...	2002-06-14

We meet four women who mourn deeply yet distinctively different. Glenda, the protector, Dawn, the peacemaker, Renee, the older more centered, and Collette, the down right hateful. Throw in an uncle that worshipped his brother, a fiancé that gets the short end of the stick, a homosexual son named Jamaica, and a mystery woman and you have a recipe for high drama and laugh out loud comedy. <br />Despite the drama and comedy I felt that the book was a bit predictable and I was bombarded with the \\"saint\\" hat that everyone laid on the deceased head.  When it was revealed that his saint hat didn't fit as well as they thought I felt that Ms. Brown lost an opportunity to examine four distinct reactions to his \\"fall\\" from grace. (Also I predicted who the mystery woman was long before it was revealed.)<br /> However this book made up for a lot in the last few chapters. Ms. Brown was able to fill my tear ducts at the wake and then turn around and make me laugh until the tears actually fell at the funeral. Though it started slow for me this book turned out to be a really good read and quite entertaining. If I could customize my review I would give it a 3.5 but since Amazon doesn't use half stars I will let it rest against the 3.  <br />Kotanya -APOOO Bookclub-	2002-05-18

Although the statement before may seem to be a contradiction, it is true. Lalita Tademy takes a mismatch, incomplete, and sometimes contradictory research of her family history and fills in the cracks beautifully and believably making it difficult to tell what is was fact and what was literary license. This story walks through several generations of women from slavery to freedom yet highlights three women who act as catalyst. Through them is where the change manifested in this family is made evident. <br />Suzette, Philomene, and Emily set the course of this family history extending from 1825 all the way until 1936. All three of these women experience life-changing situations. Some by their own creations and some created by fate; and made choices, suffering the consequences good or bad. As a result of those choices these women found themselves in an unbroken sequence \\" . . . from coffee, to cocoa, to cream, to milk, to lily, in a conscious and not-so-conscious, bleaching of the line.\\"  They bore children for white men in a time when slaves bore children for their masters as well as when Blacks were free but miscegenation laws were in place.<br />Although the books are broken down into three sections named after the women afore mentioned, this story begins with Elizabeth. She was a slave sold from a Virginia slave owner to one in Louisiana and eventually bore a daughter Suzette. Suzette, a house slave, was given privileges, like no other slave, until a fateful night when she was reminded exactly who she was in the sign of the times. Suzette bore Philomene who came into this world as a result of a \\"no-love\\" union and with the gift of sight. Being the only one that would truly marry for love, she suffered greater consequences than one should ever face that left her without words for a period of time. (Reminiscent of Maya Angelou I know why the Caged Bird Sings). But when she regained her voice shebecame determined to be more than she ever would be (or could be) by manipulating a white man, of whom she bore eight children for, who wanted her yet feared her. Philomene bore Emily, a young girl who was the apple of her father's eye and wanted for naught. She fell in love with a Frenchman who in turn loved her back but eventually would be unable to withstand the societal pressures to stay in their relationship.<br />I believe Elizabeth describes these women best in a moment of reflection: \\"Where would any of them be without Philomene's determined and clever ways, her clarity, her austerity, her singular focus? Where would Philomene be if not for Suzette's way of bending in a storm, her ability to pull into herself that brought her safely to the dawning of another day to begin again?\\" and then she questions if Emily would be the joyous one? That reflection alone makes this book worth the read.<br />So many people, places, and so much history makes up this novel that I could not begin to comment on it all but I can say it is well worth the read. There was so much power in the struggles and so much victory in the triumphs. I saw the joy, the pain, the anger, and the need in the people of this book. I dare not call them characters because they lived. They are not figments of someone's imagination, they were here breathing the same air that we do, and Ms. Tademy reminded us of that. This book was awesome! Lalita Tademy writes such vivid descriptions that it played like a movie in my head. I do encourage the readers to read the authors note. Though it is not necessary to enjoy the book it helps put things in perspective. Cane River is a \\"painstaking historical reconstruction with unforgettable storytelling.\\" What a wonderful tribute to her family.	2002-05-16
US	47354571	R1G5X9TK4ILICH	0684841436	919136449	Child of God: A Novel	Books	3	11	13	N	N	Child of God	...<BR> Lolita Files takes us down a twisted road of confusion when the characters in her book Child of God journey down dead end streets and decide to set up shop. <br />Amalie, Grace, Walter, Ophelia, Suki, Polo, Lay, Big Daddy, and the others involved with them are wrapped in a quilt of... perversions, insanity, and supernatural nightmares. I found it amazing that Ms. Files managed to sew it all together, yet she did. Each square of the quilt, separate in its on right, yet connected to the whole. I felt inundated with constant symbols of burning in hell, and I knew that I had just been introduced to the residents of the fiery pit. One must asked themselves was their anyone in the novel that was left untouched by an eminent evil? Even the innocent were doomed to embrace a spiritually dysfunctional life and each character seemed to be in his/her own level of purgatory. Going through the pangs of living with these characters left this reader frustrated and exhausted.  <br />I found this story to be depressing yet compelling. And though I stayed up into the wee hours of the morning to finish, I found myself never truly being involved with the characters only a mere spectator in their lives. I wanted to know what happened but I didn't particularly care how it was all resolved. I felt that Ms Files expected some leaps to made about some characters and yet in contrast there were other relationships that moved me.<br />Despite what may seem like contradictions in this story I would give it 3 stars and would recommend to those who asked. It was engaging and entertaining. (It had to be because I was up until 1 am). Most of the enjoyment for me in this novel came from the fact that it was just an interesting story with an interesting theme, and interesting characters.<br />Having read all of the Lolita Files novels I can say that Child of God was a complete departure from her previous work. Although I am more of a fan of her first works... I do applaud her for venturing outand doing something different.   <br />Reviewed by Kotanya<BR> -APOO Bookclub-	2002-05-07

Nigger: The Strange Career of a Troublesome Word by Randall Kennedy is a book that most definitely has had and will continue to have a profound influence on the discussion of race, racism, and language in today's greater society as well as the legal community. This book embarks on a journey of the word Nigger, that our media has tagged the \\"N\\" word, and condensed into 4 chapters; 177 pages of extensive research and thought with extensive pages of end notes.<br />Randall Kennedy, himself a Law professor, begins his thoughts with a series of questions. One most noticeably to this reader was \\" Is it (the word nigger) a more hurtful racial epithet than insults such as kike, whop, wetback, mick, chink, and gook?\\" I immediately was struck by this and thus began my discussion     (mental of course) with the author as I read. I found this one sentence was only a sign of things to come and it was necessary for me to read this book with a pencil in my hand so I could comment in the margins. <br />Kennedy's discussion of the word Nigger falls under four umbrellas, The Protean N word, Nigger in Court, Pitfalls in Fighting Nigger, How Are We Doing with Nigger. As I read I found the first chapter to be interesting; chocked full of antidotes from the famous and(what some may call)the infamous. However some of Kennedy's remarks, though undaunted, I found some what disturbing and disagreed with. This attitude, though unexpected, didn't much change as I read the rest of the book. <br />In his chapters dealing with Nigger's use in court or legal matters, I found that Kennedy's discussion, supported by rulings in court cases and his interpretations of the law, after a while became laborious. He bombarded his readers with many different court cases and incidents which were doused with a great deal of \\"legalise\\". At one point I thought maybe I ought to be a lawyer to have a complete understanding of the points he was trying to make. The one point that did stand out in this chapter was the exception in the First Amendment of the Constitution referred to as the \\"fighting - words doctrine\\" and how courts ruled against users of the word referring to this doctrine. I believe what makes it even more interesting was Kennedy's own rejections of these rulings.<br />Later in his discussion of the pitfalls of fighting the word Nigger, he points out how many African Americans have used the word to exploit themselves, or use it for personal gain. He also discusses issues brought up against the word that he felt had no basis. For example there is a particular debate about how the definition of Nigger appeared in the dictionary, as well as a long tedious harangue about Amos n Andy verses Def Comedy Jam. These discussions definitely warranted my comments in the margin. <br />Lastly, in the discussion on how Nigger is used only by the chosen that have been affirmed its us, he makes it clear that affirmation of its use does not lie typically in those who are not Black and most definitely not for those who are seeking some kind of status in American society. Yet he does believe that there is \\"much to be gained by allowing people of all backgrounds to yank nigger away from white supremacists, to subvert its ugliest denotation, and covert the N-word from a negative into a positive appellation.\\" And he believes that this has already began to occur.<br />When I began reading this I thought I held no real expectations yet I discovered I did because this book met none of them. I was surprised, astounded, and challenged. This book is a great book to challenge your thinking about the word Nigger. Although you may not agree with Professor Kennedy (and I didn't on quite a few levels) it will make you scrutinize your thought process in regard to racial matters, legal matters, and do words matter. I rated this book 3 out of 5 stars because of his thought provoking references and discussions obviously set up for debate. However if someone asked me if I liked what he had to say Imight respond, \\"N-word please.\\" -Apoo bookclub-	2002-05-05

Why? Because this is a good book to sit down, relax and enjoy like a great cup of coffee.<br />She starts us out with &quot;I may be a supersoldier but I sure as hell ain't no Superwoman.&quot; But we have to say we disagree! Sergeant Sanderella Coffee has to be superwoman to deal with all that she goes through with her King, Drill Sergeant Romulus Caesar. <br />Tracy Thompson-Price takes us on a rollercoaster relationship with Sandie and Rom. Sandie meets her Mr. Right, unfortunately he has a Mrs. Right or shall we say in his case a Mrs. Wrong. And yet she chooses to love nonetheless. As we further in this ride the hills get higher and the drops get further. Sandie making that choices she makes takes her on a ride that seems smooth sailing until Rom flips the switch and all of a sudden we feel we are going backward. This ride will then begin to make your stomachs drop and may cause you to let out a belly scream. Yet it ends in love and forgiveness in more ways than one.<br />This book was entertaining. Sometimes funny, somtimes sad, somtimes making you angry, and sometimes frustrating. The ranges of emotions are real and even sometimes over the top. WE find that if you are in the military or familiar with the military then you will better appreciate some of the nuances, however you need not know anything in order to enjoy it. Our bookclub gave this book three stars and we agreed that it would be a recommended read.	2002-03-18
