If you prefer to read fiction that agrees with what you already think, or helps you sleep at night, this story isn't for you. However, if you enjoy engaging, incredibly well-written, (and superbly translated), literature, you will enjoy this book. &quot;Nausea&quot;, like &quot;Woman in the Dunes&quot; by Kobo Abe, is not an easy or comfortable story to plow through, but it is a fascinating and superb story. Also, don't pass this book if you are intimidated by all the high falutin' philosophy talk; enjoy this book as the remarkable, if disturbing story, that it is. Excellent reading.	2000-12-31

Then there is this wonderful book by Nicholas Humphrey. Where other would-be Rationalists fail, Humphrey succeeds. He lays out for us  elegantly, reasonably, sanely and with humour and compassion, the Materialist case; pointing out more succintly than anyone else I've read the flaws, not only in the logic of &quot;Paranormalists&quot;, but many of the logical flaws &quot;debunkers&quot; fall into. The style of the book is relaxed and conversational, honest and straightforward and enjoyable. Sane medicine for the intellect. Highly recommended.	2000-12-21

The basic premise, that humanity is in one way or another influenced by another sophisticated, if elusive, Intelligence, seems sound to me. And there is an abundance of circumstantial evidence for such an idea, (though I personally tend to veer away from the Spirit World explanation and ET explanation and am much more fascinated by the &quot;Ultraterrestrial&quot; theories of John Keel, among others.) But this book doesn't put forth any clear theory and follow through with it. It's as if the author was hoping that if he threw enough gunk on the wall, some of it might stick. All the reader gets, however, is a confusing gunked-up wall...Some pretty  wild stuff gets thrown out, (for example, Jesus was fair-skinned  and red-haired...?...), and most frustrating of all, almost NO substantiation for the claims being made, (the bibliography looks  like the author went to nearest New Age bookstore, scooped up a handful of books from the bestseller shelf, and took his ideas from that...why do I get the feeling that's EXACTLY what happened?) And, last but not least, we are treated to the Masonic-Secret Society-Brotherhood theory of the Wooly-Boogers who supposedly are behind the scenes pulling all the strings, I guess at the behest of the Alien bad guys. Even if there was a shred of truth to this, and I mean this sincerely, who gives a flying leap? Most of us live quite well day-to-day, thank you, without the benefit of Big Brother, or Who/What-ever; so if a bunch of adolescent-minded Bilderbergers or what want to get together, practice their secret handshakes and other James Bond games, fine with me. Who cares? Premise is fascinating. But this book does nothing with it. Save your money.	2000-12-15

Jean-Francois Six has given Therese back to the world. As a Carmelite contemplative living at the end of the 19th century, Therese was in the midst of a cultural and spiritual revolution as Faith began to give way to Doubt and Cynical Skepticism. Her struggle was to remain faithful to her mystical devotion to Christ in the midst of a world eager to find new, and even more dubious, devotions. Her solution: if you can't beat them, join them; not by discarding faith, but by allowing the full force of doubt to fill and break her heart in order to understand and feel  kinship with the doubting world around her, making her an even greater Saint than the revised, silly, &quot;canonized&quot; version given by her sister, Mother Agnes, and the Church. Her courage was to stare down the night in loving trust that there would be a dawn...somehow. Whether you understand or agree with Therese's spirituality, you cannot help but admire her mature and courageous faith and her simple belief in the power of Love. This  book takes her down off the altars and solidly in our hearts, where she would most want to be...	2000-12-02

The danger in this intellectual laziness is that it  then leaves people vulnerable to whatver snake-oil salesman wanders into town. They might be selling &quot;Alien Abductions&quot;, but they could also be selling Dogmatic Skepticism. For 2000 years, (more or less), Western Civilization has been told &quot;how to think&quot;  about God, sexuality, The State, etc. Having grown tired of the Vatican approach, we now seem eager to hand our brains over to a new Magisterium: Orthodox Western Science; and the heretics of this new True Church are treated just as ruthlessly, (take Wilhelm Reich as an example).

Many of the points in this book, (historicity, or lack thereof, of Jesus, etc), are better covered in other works for the intrepid explorer. Many of those other works, however, are not very accessible to the lay student and would probably be only of interest to old toothless heretics like me...So for the first-timer willing to take a peek behind the curtain this will be a mind-blowing expereince. But for you other Heretics out there, some points to ponder...Acharya weaves together the various martyred-saviour-solar warrior-eucharistic myths, anchors  them in Egypt, ?, and then, voila!, pulls Christianity out of a tophat. The Christian Apologist, C.S.Lewis, took those mythological similarities and chose to see them as antecedents to the &quot;Christian Revelation&quot;...in other words, six of one/half dozen of the other. Frazier's &quot;Golden Bough&quot; seems to suggest that all of these myths express common human concerns and I'd puts my money on 'dat one, personally. What to make of the Conspiracy part of this? As that great western philosopher, Bugs Bunny, might say...&quot;hmmmmm, could be...&quot;, but who cares? And was Jesus completely fictional? Perhaps; but it's much more likely that he was a real, if obscure, figure of Roman occupied Palestine who was one of many loony apocalyptic figures that plagued Judea at the time. That this minor player was then taken by Paul of Tarsus, (assuming HE existed, which I'm not too sure),  and the historian Eusebius-in-the-pay-of-Emperor Constantine, and transformed into the Saviour of the World seems more likely. The Roman world at the dawn of Byzantium was awash with pious fictions...what's one more? But, fun stuff here, will push the envelope for you, and Acharya's humour, and compassion, will charm you.	2000-12-02

As a book that details the origins, history and,(to a point), beliefs of Witnesses, this is an interesting book. It is also a highly polemical book and it is that polemic that worries me...fiercely. I am not a Witness, have no desire to become one, either. While religious beliefs of all flavors have always fascinated me, I have been equally dismayed by their irrationality and oft-times silliness. Religion has given us much  beauty, such as Chartres Cathedral. It has also given us much horror, such as Heaven's Gate. But that's my opinion; that and a buck-twenty five will buy you a cup of coffee. The United States was founded, in part, by men and women whose religious/political beliefs were no more or less wacky than those of Witnesses. They fled Europe, and Elsewhere, to come to a place where they could live as they choose, believe as they choose, raise their children  as they choose and BE LEFT ALONE. I am all for the spread of Reason and the defeat of Ignorance...but by whose definition? And what gives them the right to decide what is &quot;Reasonable&quot; and what is &quot;Irrational&quot;? The health of a Tolerant Democracy can be measured by the way we treat groups like the Witnesses; and the more unpopular the group, the more neccesary our tolerance. The author William S.Burroughs once lamented that we have become &quot;a nation of finks, where no one is allowed to mind their own business.&quot; Don't like Witness Theology?

As historical entertainment, (bordering at times on fiction), I wholeheartedly give the book 5 stars. But...some of the conclusions in Ms.Weir's book are sheer speculation, sometimes bordering on irresponsible. (Her appalling  theory that Cecil may have had a hand in the murder-probably suicide-of Amy Dudley so shocked me I almost dropped the book from my hands). Also disturbing is the almost cavalier approach the author takes regarding the horrible suffering of conscientious Roman Catholics, dissenting Protestants and Scottish and Irish nationalists. Often Weir assures us that Elizabeth was actually a moderate in such matters, ?!, and that only a few hundred Catholics and a smattering of Anabaptists lost  their heads...are we really supposed to think to ourselves, &quot;Oh, is that all...&quot; Mary Stuart's machinations and matrimonial shenanigans were no worse than Elizabeth's, but this book portrays Mary Stuart as an incompetent fool. Mary Stuart was many  things...incompetent was not among them...and the yearning for independence and freedom among the Irish and Scottish are treated  off-handedly, the insurrections in Ireland being written off as an irritation to Elizabeth's reign. I sometimes expected to turn the page and see Weir write something like: &quot;Why couldn't all these annoying people just keep quiet and be good, loyal Anglicans?&quot; Yet, it's hard to fault Weir's book for all these glosses when so many books on the Elizabethan era take the some approach.  This book will leave you in stark admiration for a complex sovereign who ruled her nation as she thought best. Just remember, that the Elizabethan era may have been glorious for some, but for dissenting Protestants like the Puritans, Roman Catholics and Celts, her reign must have been anything but glorious, something this text, like so many others, just drops in the dirt...	2000-10-21

The Elizabethan Mystic/Astrologer/Statesman, John Dee, does make mention of &quot;a necronomicon&quot; in his writings, and a few other late  medieval/early renaissance magic texts speak of &quot;necronomicons&quot; also; but the term &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, loosely translated &quot;spellbook of the dead&quot;, could refer to several kinds of texts, and maybe even unwritten, memorized spells. While much is made of the &quot;Sumerian&quot;  mythology in this particular &quot;Necronomicon&quot;, any leisurely perusal of a dictionary of Near East mythology should put that issue to rest.  For some time now, among some scholars of the NeoPagan Revival/Wicca phenemenon, it has long been rumored that this text  may have been concocted by, or under the auspices of, the late Hermann Slater, one-time proprietor of the &quot;Magickal Childe&quot; bookstore in New York.

The boys fail to see the difference...and so do I. That  aside, one of the fascinating angles of this book is the extreme lifestyles  of Rick and the Ultra-Orthodox Chassid.

This book offers food for thought as to why this may have  been.  It is astonishing to learn in this book that Parsons, (perhaps the  most important contributor to space travel), never completed a formal  college education and yet went on to transform the universe ...literally.  So why would so brilliant and gifted a man lead such a self-destructive  life? One possible reason found within this book is Parsons painful  relationship, (or lack of one), with his father, and his life-long search  to find a substitute for one...in all the wrong places. The pain of a  wounded soul can produce either a Saint, Monster or Victim and Parsons  might have been a little of all three. The book is eloquent testimony that  the inability to let go of pain, disappointment and hatred, (such as  Parsons adolescent tirades against Christianity and &quot;God the  Father&quot;), and the lush indulging of pain and hatred via Occult  practice leads only to destruction. (One has to wonder if Parsons'  clumsiness and lack of safety consciousness in handling dangerous chemicals  was, to one degree or another, a sign of self-loathing.) Yet, in spite of  his tragic ending, the most enduring legacy of Parsons is the ability of  Humankind to travel into space thanks to his brilliant work in rocketry.  And Parsons has left us another legacy...what unresolved hatred leads to  and the exacerbation of that hatred by indulging in the &quot;Occult&quot;.  It's a fine line between being a courageous innovator and metaphysician and  merely being a tormented demagogue. It's sobering to think that of all the  forces and powers Parsons thought he could conjure, he was so unable to  exorcise his soul of it's own demons.	2000-08-17

It's remarkable that 500 years after her death, Teresa continues to provoke admiration and castigation, something I think she would have  enjoyed, albeit quietly... One thing I relished about this book is the  balance the author achieves in relating Teresa the strong reformer and  writer and Teresa the Mystic. We are not spared the strange nature of  Teresa's mystical life, but neither is it treated in &quot;tabloid&quot;  fashion, either. It's important to understand that in her writings,  (especially &quot;Interior Castle&quot;), Teresa took great pains  to warn  people engaged in the mystical life that &quot;supernatural&quot;  occurrences should neither be sought or expected and if they do occur to  question them deeply and thoroughly. (Teresa's contemporary and friend,  John of the Cross, offers the same explicit warning in his writings). Yet,  it is troubling to observe so many people try to &quot;explain away&quot;  Teresa's mystical experiences as &quot;neurosis&quot; or  &quot;insanity&quot;. If people paint their faces blue and jump about,  scream, weep or faint at a soccer match, we may think it eccentric, but  don't necessarily categorize such people as &quot;psychotic&quot;; but if  someone expresses enthusiasm and allows the profound depth of their faith  and love to express itself, (whether there is something  &quot;supernatural&quot; behind it or not), that kind of expression is  &quot;crazy&quot;. At best, this is intellectual dishonesty. Teresa is  solidly a product of her time, with all of its best and worst aspects. Her  allure is her ability to transcend those limitations and challenge us to  become more than what we are. That alone is enough to make some people  apoplectic...	2000-08-17

Unlike many  authors of Aztec religion, Carrasco doesn't shy away from presenting the  most grim aspects of Aztec human sacrifice, (from the drawing of thorns  through the tongue to the heart wrenching sacrifice of children to the  phantasmagoric ripping of hearts from chest cavities). In presenting these  grim aspects, Carrasco asks the question &quot;why&quot; and offers one  possible explanation in the context of the notion of communal city life and  the preservation of a common cosmology and morality via ritual and myth,  even if violent. Carrasco admits, refreshingly, that this is not the only  explanation, and, in fact, we may never fully understand what would prompt  any civilization to such wholesale spiritual slaughter, but Carrasco is one  of very few scholars in religious studies willing to critically and  objectively deal with the notion of violence in religion.  One caveat: this  is not a casual read and familiarity with Religious Studies and the work of  Burkert and Eliade is assumed. At times the text can be hard going and the  completion of the book has the abruptness of falling off a cliff. But for  readers interested in the study of religion and how it shapes us, this book  is an important addition to your bookshelf.	2000-08-17

This entry in the series concerns the history and practice of European witchcraft and magic in the 20th century,(and the book  is focused on Europe and particularly Britain. There is only scant  information on witchcraft and magic in North America). This is a refreshing  objective study which approaches the subject from a  sociological/anthropological approach; it is not intended as an apologia  for witchcraft or neo-paganism, nor is it intended as a deconstruction of  the topics. Also refreshing is that the writers spend little time  &quot;psychoanalyzing&quot; and &quot;rationalizing&quot;. What you get  here is factual, fairly objective reporting. The book is divided in three  sections: I.Modern Pagan Witchcraft-it's cultural and spiritual antecedents  and history. Especially important here is the treatment of Margaret Murray,  Gerald Gardner and Crowley. Also fascinating is the information provided on  how the  &quot;paganism&quot; of the Romantic Movement provided impetus for  the later development of full blown &quot;pagan revival&quot; religions.  (Also, as an enticement  for you...did you know that Wicca and the Boy  Scouts have a common ancestor! ) For readers hungry for historical facts on  the &quot;new&quot; religions  of Wicca and NeoPaganism, this section of  the book provides valuable information. The author of this section, Ronald  Hutton of the University of Bristol, seems confident that Wiccans and  NeoPagans are ready for this kind of objective exegesis. I'm not so sure...  II.Satanism and Satanic Mythology-written by Jean La Fontaine of the London  School of Economics; level-headed and factual. La Fontaine details the  brief history of this small and very recent religious movement and also  debunks much of the satanic abuse hysteria whipped up by some conservative  Christian groups, there just ain't no  &quot;there&quot; there when it  comes to thesecharges. As in the Pagan Witchcraft section, La Fontaine  does not bore us with trite psychoanalysis, but just good reporting.  Important here is the objective study La Fontaine gives to The Church of  Set as opposed to La Vey Satanism; heretofore most studies of these two  movements have taken &quot;sides&quot; in the oft-times bitter feuding  between the two. My only objection to this section is the lumping of  Asatru/Odinism and Northern European Heathenism  in this section instead of  either in a section of it's own or as a corollary section to Pagan  Witchcraft. While some, if not most, of Northern European Heathenism does  contain some of the same religio-political concerns as some satanic groups,  it is also strikingly dis-similar and deserves to be studied in its own  right rather as a &quot;cousin&quot; of satanism. III.The Continued  Existence of Traditional Witchcraft...maybe. This section, actually an  overview of the cultural anthropology of witch folklore and  &quot;bewitchment&quot;, demonstrates how difficult it is to really form a  cohesive argument  that if organized witchcraft existed at all in the  past, there is very little evidence for it. All we have is a bewildering  host of healing traditions, &quot;hexes&quot; and remedies against hexes,  and whether this is evidence of the survival of witchcraft, shamanism or  simply folk-ways, is hard to say. The authors are remarkably open to the  possibility of real withcraft traditions that pre-date Wicca, but  demonstrate the lack of evidence for it. For students of Mysticism,  religious arcana and the  Occult, this volume provides a wealth of  information about this fascinating, and curious, part of the Western  Esoteric Tradition.	2000-07-05

As he did for Frank DiLeo's photobook, Don H.Mader once again provides excellent end notes on the artist and his techniques.  More than just nude photos of men, Kingdome19 uses double-exposure, cut-up,  &quot;fading&quot; and shadow to bring to the viewer the power of  masculinity, giving the images a sexual charge that mere  &quot;picture-taking&quot; doesn't express. These photographs are also some  of the few examples I've seen where erection and light bondage are used  artfully and tastefully and, again, enhance the iconography of virility  rather than caricature it.  One double-exposed photo of a model in the  classic &quot;St.Sebastian&quot; pose with the background of  a cross and  Roman ruins is brilliant. When photographs draw the viewer into the work  and causes them to linger and explore the image, you know the Artist has  done his job well. This is just such a collection.	2000-06-22

Chariton has written a wonderful resource, (and one of the few resources), about a great American mystery. Between 1896-1897, mostly in the west and midwest and Texas, came a flurry of reports about a  cigar-shaped Airship, complete with crew, long before successful aircraft  existed...or so we have thought. While some details of the Aircraft varied  from report to report, there were startling similarities, this long before  TV and radio. Chariton writes about this great mystery with a sense of fun,  awe and intrigue. He also provides a fascinating window on what life was  like in the late 1890's. What is fascinating about the book are the  startling parallels between the Airship reports and our own Flying Saucer  reports and the almost painful see-sawing between outright sceptical  dismissal and credulity. Chariton provides his reader with a  chronology of  events, maps and excerpts from the newspapers of the day and places you  right in the middle of the events, as if you were there, one of the  befuddled witnesses. So what was the Great Airship? You'll have to read  this book and decide for yourself! And I highly recommend it; this book was  a fun and adventurous read and will leave you wondering...	2000-06-14

In their aim to try and capture masculinity some erotic photographers lapse into a kind of &quot;hyper-masculinity&quot; that ends  up being a comical  caricature of male power. Not Herve Bodilis. Bodilis allows the beauty and  power of the male form to speak for itself. His Art celebrates and honors  the male form and Bodilis is not afraid to depict the raw energy of lust  without falling into the merely pornographic. His use of suggestive poses,  water and (I think) Champagne, in one photo, &quot;suggests&quot; other  possibilities in an artisitc, imaginative and highly erotic way. Plus, it's  refreshing when an artists work reveals his respect and admiration for his  models and it shows here. One model, sporting some great tattoos and  wearing an upside down crucifix, alone is worth getting the book; an  original and great looking guy. Highly recommended.	2000-06-14

People have been  reporting experiences of this kind in all periods of human history and in  all cultures, (see Jacques Vallee's  PASSPORT TO MAGONIA. Is there meant to  be a subtle wink and nod to Vallee in this book's title?) Dr.Mack has  always struck me as a courageous man in actually listening to his patients  and taking their stories seriously even if not understanding what any of it  is supposed to mean. As a true scientific mind Dr.Mack chronicled his  patient's experiences, looked for patterns and similarities and ended up  scratching his head more than before while captivating and intriguing the  rest of us who admire his integrity and work. So what's going on here? What  distresses me is not that Dr.Mack is suggesting other possibilities as to  &quot;What&quot; is at the heart of this phenemenon, (I've never bought,  nor entirely dismissed, the ET explanation), but he almost, almost, goes  entirely over the falls of  religious hoopla and, almost, comes close to  the &quot;these are angels from heaven&quot; camp. Forget the tales of cold  metal tables and painful stabs in the abdomen...they are &quot;our  Friends&quot;...with &quot;friends&quot; like these...you know the rest. So  I'm worried. Worried that this book may be Dr.Mack's swan song to his  maverick work and research in this area; a way of letting go by allowing it  to float away on the rainbow with Judy Garland singing in the background,  everything's rosie, these are just entities from the spirit world,  (whatever that's supposed to be). But what if it's SOMETHING ELSE? Perhaps  after years and years and years of relentless ridicule, academic  ultimatums, inquisitions and also being chased by ET enthusiast loonies,  perhaps Dr.Mack is just simply tired and is looking for a way to honorably  and poetically end this chapter of his professional life and, in light of  what he's had to go through, who could blame him.

The  Old Order was convinced that there was something &quot;wrong&quot; with  being human, (i.e. Original  Sin, The Fall, Ad Nauseam), and  Rational-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy,(sounds Orwellian doesn't it?), makes  the same mistake, though it pretends not to. Orthodox religion presented to  us what was and was not acceptable, what was and was not healthy, and  Rationalism has been quick to catch the falling garter as Old Dame   Christianity slowly passes into obscurity.

If Sagan, in the same book,  wonders if the myth of the demi-god Oannes might not be evidence of ancient  extraterrestrial visits that's ok...but if Erich Von Daniken does that he's  a crackpot.

Would have been nice if he just kept to mountaineering and  buggering North  African young boys, but, alas, or perhaps  &quot;Aiwass&quot;, he decided he was the Master Therion announcing the Age  of The Conquering Child. If so, the Child's a brat.  Crowley was a wild  eccentric, not the first or probably the last to spring from England's  mountains green, but hardly a mystic.  If Aiwass did &quot;exist&quot;, one  of John Keel's &quot;Ultraterrestrials&quot; maybe, the bubble head must  have floated way chuckling thinking to himself...&quot;Old P.T. was  right...&quot;	2000-05-24

Following quick on  their heels came the drug addict Crowley and the opportunist Regardie and  from them came the S/M enthusiast Gardner, Patriarch of all the Wiccan  NeoPagan nonsense to follow. Such the illustrious genealogy  of a  phenemenon...if that's what it is... The chaos of the 18th, 19th and 20th  centuries with their genocidal wars, revolutions and dramatic swings in  philosophy/theology had begun to erode traditional orthodox religion and  the mystically inclined turned elsewhere. Some of the results of this  spiritual revolution tend toward the comic, (Theosophy and the Mumbo-Jumbo  of Gurdjieff and Ouspensky, godfathers of Deepak Chopra and the venerable  school of making something--money and/or fame--by saying nothing), and it  also led to that sad path illustrated a few sentences back. Western  Esotericism survived, of course, but more so in Art and Literature than as  a deliberately chosen spiritual path and that's unfortunate. It's   comparable to having a beautiful ship being taken over by the rats.  Paganism is NOT a pure faith; there is no such thing as  &quot;Orthodox&quot; Paganism. Paganism is the gut-level responses of a  people to the environment  they face at a given time and place. NeoPaganism  is more of an ecological/political response to the  decay of more  established religious institutions and it should be studied as such, rather  than the resurrection of old ideas that, for better or worse, are dead and  gone. Wicca has it's roots more in daring exploration of sexual practices  than in the &quot;resurrection&quot; of Maternally-Passed wisdom, (cute  idea as that is.) This book, as well as the chronicle of an odd turn  in  the history of religion, is also testimony that no matter how many times  religion changes its  face it tends toremain the same...worn out dogmas,  silly rituals, tired practices and the tyranny of priesthoods and dogmas.  This is progress? This is sexual revolution? This is feminism? This is  ecological? It's merely the same old insanity in drag. But we can take  comfort in the knowledge that their will probably always be those who dare  to question, who take little comfort in beliefs and are interested in  Knowledge instead. Who instead of drawing down the moon reach out toward  it... and beyond...	2000-05-24

Callow is our Good Captain, steering us carefully, ethically and factually  through the early life and career of a Great Genius. Callow's biography is  refreshing in that he does not dwell on endless psycho-analysis or  speculation, if he cannot substantiate an item, he leaves it there. Almost  incredible in this age of paparazzi-revisionism-and outright falsehood. He  respects his readers and Callow's tone through-out this extremely  well-written book is that of a conversation with a trusted friend.  If you  are a Welles fan, you will enjoy reading of  his exploits in Dublin at the  Gate Theatre and the passages dealing with the Mercury are pure gold.  Callow's portrayal of Welles' experiences in Hollywood at the time of  CITIZEN KANE will leave you in awe that Welles could have survived that  period of his life; but it also reveals the sheer energy, tenacity and  genius of the man. Callow shows a man burning both ends of the  candle...burning them off with a blowtorch. It's heartbreaking to read how  Welles, for all his genius, is already in the early days of his life sowing  the seeds of his own downfall through excess.  An excellent book about an  incredible man written by a wonderful actor...and a wonderfully decent man.  Why can't more biographies be this ethical?	2000-05-18

Photos range from the sublime to the ridiculous. Some of the models are shown in industrial and urban-ruin settings, but this has been done WAY better by other artists. Many of the   photos, (too many), showing men in work boots, look too staged and obvious.  Several of the photographs have the models sneering at the camera with that  &quot;stoned Elvis&quot; look, a detraction from the art and the men. One  photo of a model dancing with the springs from an old mattress can be  detached and discarded. In short, if you are a die-hard collector, you can  get this book if you want to round out your collection, but passing it by  won't diminish your collection either. For the passing motorist, you can  find the same type of photographs in almost any good porno mag.	2000-05-02

All  of the photographs are in color and ALL of them are beautiful. Lukas  expresses a ease, comfort and confidence with his body that raises the  photography to a level of sensual wholesomeness...no  self-hatred-expressed-as-erotica here, for a change. Bel Ami has a  supernatural ability to capture Lukas as if Light was radiating out from  within him, and several times as you turn the pages of this photobook you  will be startled by the beauty and Artistry of these two men.

Burroughs referred to that wide gap of history, &quot;a long question mark&quot;. Dr.Schoch's book, however, while absolutely  fascinating, sheds little light on the &quot;long question mark&quot;. This  book is heavy on catastrophes and little about ancient civilizations.  Dr.Schoch starts the book by defending his theory that the Sphinx may be  twice as old as conventionally thought, then a little about the antiquity  of the Lascaux caves and an interesting bit about the possibility that the  Magdalenian culture of ancient Europe and Asia Minor culminating in Catal  Huyuk may have inspired the myths of Atlantis. All quite interesting and  worthy of more in depth analysis; but Dr.Schoch merely throws these  theories out with little information on their merits or pitfalls,(though he  does go to some lengths to defend his theories about the possible older age  of the Sphinx.) Far from being paradigm shifting, well over 75% of the book  is an apologia for orthodox scientific thinking in regard to catastrophism  and possible pre-historic civilizations. Dr.Schoch even resorts,  disappointingly, to calling theories he doesn't agree with, (Hapgood,  Velikovsky, Sitchin), as &quot;blather&quot;...the old tried and true  tactic of the True Faith: label the heretics as lunatics. This is paradigm  shifting? Still, the passages in the book about what happens when large  extraterrestrial bodies hit are hair-raising and well worth the price of  the book. But paradigm shifting?

If you are a Wilson fan,  though, you may be disappointed if you are expecting New Wilsonian   Revelations. Much of what Wilson covers in the &quot;Cosmic Trigger&quot;  books is re-hashed here, especially the Vatican Bank-Roberto Calvi scandal  and R.A.W's affection for Discordianism in general and the Church of the  subGenius in particular. For conspiracy afficianados, you may be bewildered  by Wilson's interest in the Priory of Sion,(even if some of the French  Aristocracy fancy themselves progeny of Jesus Christ and Mary  Magdalene...who cares?), and you are bound to wonder why your own favourite  conspiracy or Secret Society isn't mentioned,(I would have loved hearing  Wilson's spin on Opus Dei, that scary right-wing Roman Catholic  organization that sometimes seems like it  wants to turn the world into a  Carthusian Monastery and also no mention of the proliferation  of strange  contrails in our skies.

Through graphic imagery of sex and  death Burroughs will  play you like a miscreant attacking a cathedral pipe organ, pulling out all  the stops, feet pounding all the pedals at once, hands stomping the keys,  blasting the pipes.

Wilson's book strikes me as a plea for free,  and sane, thought. Wilson will point out with devastating clarity how often  we are straight-jacketed into reality tunnels both of our own making and  those imposed on us by EXPERTS. (digression here...if you enjoyed this book  and Wilson's shots at the &quot;experts&quot;, watch the film FAKE by Orson  Welles. Great fun.) Wilson challenges us to be Creative Agnostics, to not  be so quick to dogmatize, to be a little less constipated about how  Universe works and acts. Warning though...if you are a layman, as I am, to  scientific and philosophical terminology, keep a good dictionary of those  terms handy! Is well worth it, though, fellow laymen! Wilson is the Groucho  Marx of Academia; if he is obnoxious, it's only the more to point how  insultingly pretentious the EXPERTS are that he gives the rasberry to.

He is re-tracing the stapes of a mid-Byzantine era monk, John Moschos, and  recording what is left of the Byzantine Christian world Moschos lived in.  If you are obsessed with ancient Christian-Byzantine arcana, (as I  hopelessly am), you will glue your eyes to these pages as Dalrymple  describes what remains of the Nestorians, Monophysites and obscure  heterodox sects like the Yezidis with the same passion as a pimpled  teenager with a flashlight and a copy of Playboy under his bedsheets late  at night. Dalrymple gives a very brutal assessment of alleged atrocities  committed by the Maronites and Israelis. Dalrymple struggles to remain  objective, but is obviously difficult when he sees the misery he sees.  While some of the superstition and fanaticism he encounters has a bizarre  kind of charm there is also an element of horror when religous convictions  are so intense that riddling the bodies of infants with bullits can be  considered a pious act. It is sad to see the slow passing of ancient  Christian cultures which have left us such a beautiful legacy of art,  architecture and music; but one can't help but wonder if there wouldn't be  a little more humanity and peace if the churches, mosques and synagaogues   ALL became things of the past and we as a species  use a little logic and  less Santa Claus. If Dalrymple does nothing else, he chronicles the misery  of religion.	2000-02-13

If James Randi had done nothing else, his exposing of Uri Geller as a stage magician pretending to be  an Agent of the Supernatural would have  been public service enough. In a bewildering world of all kinds of claims  you really have to read correctives like those by James Randi and Martin  Gardner to keep from falling off the deep end. And   as an important  antidote to nonsense this book deserves 5 stars. However... It can be  frightening and discouraging to realize how often large groups of people  are willing to sacrifice common sense in the quest to find  something...anything...to give meaning and purpose to life. But that  &quot;sacrifice of common sense&quot; can also include dogmatic faith in  science. There are Evangelists on every street corner of human discourse  and Randi can, at times, come across with all the Fire, and  close-mindedness, of any Evangelist. At the foundation of both scientism  and occultism you will find the same hubris: that human beings can  understand it all. Religion and Occultism promise us that we are  extraordinary beings, &quot;little less than the angels&quot;, with  extraordinary powers. Scientism tells us that, eventually, we will conquer  it all, space, time, disease, death. Behind both stances is the refusal to  accept, to greater/lesser degree, that in reality we are mere animals  living within an extraordinary universe we will never be able to fully  fathom. Both mysticism and scientism are more than happy to quickly dismiss  anything that doesn't fit into their paradigms; but what happens when  something or someone upsets those paradigms?  Why does the Universe exist  at all? Beliefs that it is the creation of a Super Being are  disenchanting,(at least to me), but it also strikes me as just as  intellectually &quot;lazy&quot; to dismiss the question as irrelevant as  scientism often does. On your bookshelf along with Randi should be at least  one or two books by John Keel and Robert Anton Wilson. Adherents to the  Religion of Scientism fiercely cling to the works of professional skeptics  like Randi as much as some cling to the Bible, and booke by folks like  R.A.Wilson and Keel are bound to make them gnash their teeth as much as  Randi does the same to &quot;Gellerites&quot;. Randi is qouted as saying on  one of his television   specials, &quot;I try to live as much as possible  in the real world&quot;; respectfully, and humbly, we all have to ask, what  in the hell is REAL? Randi's works are important medicine for gullibility;  just don't fall from one mistaken assumption headlong into another.	2000-01-25

What an Empire. It's name, Byzantine, has become a description for all that is seethingly,  insidously, complicated. Byzantium represented the best and worst of being  human: incredible art, touching piety, hypocrisy unparallelled, heroism  unmatched, murderous Emperors, jaw dropping architecture, and political  intrigue. All leading up to that day in May when it all fell forever. Lord  Norwich brings it all back. Will have to get the three volumes now!	2000-01-25

Bad Dog Toto...I mean Hutchins... Whether you agree with all of his conclusions, Hutchins' book is a necessary critique, not only of Mother Teresa but of the whole religous philosophy of using other people's  misfortune and pain to your own spiritual advantage. There are literally  thousands of other Christians, and other people of faith and conscience,  who work tirelessly and heroically not only for the poor, broken and  oppressed, but AGAINST the oppressor. As an example, you have only to look  at the remarkable work of the American Friends Service Committee to see  true selfless action in progress. Teresa's goal was her own sanctification  and union with Christ, quite sincerely, and she was willing to justify just  about anything and gloss over oceans of compromise to meet this goal.  Remember many many years back when Time magazine printed her photo on the  cover and Teresa consented to have it published, supposedly reluctantly,  only if  &quot;God will release one soul from Purgatory for each photo  printed&quot;...is it just me or is it the ultimate in hubris to believe  that my likeness will release souls from purgatory?  Will she be canonized  a saint? Probably; and probably by John Paul II who has shown his  willingness to rush through canonizations for political reasons even if  troubling questions surround the candidate, (i.e. such as Maximillian Kolbe  and the allegations that in Poland anti-semitic literature was published  under his auspices. Defenders of Kolbe allege that yes, his religous press  unfortunately did publish such garbage but Father Kolbe didn't agree with  it. So why did allow it to be published?) And how very different Teresa of  Calcutta is from the other Teresa's who preceded her: Teresa of Avila,  spiritual adventuress, who had no problem tweeking the noses of  hypocritical Princes and Prelates and Terese of Lisiuex, the Little Flower,  who struggled with her faith as a carmelite nun, often with unrelenting  anguish, quietly tryingto understand God and the contradictions of faith,  out of the limelight and who may have NEVER been canonized a saint were it  not for the sometimes shameless canonization campaign of her sister and the  Guerin family. In a world of human suffering and injustice we definitely  need people willing to work hard to make our planet a better place to live  and thousands of unsung saints are doing just that, every day, quietly,  away from the cameras and the covers of the world's papers.  We would do  well to listen to the contrary voices of those who would question the  motives of those we would canonize &quot;Saint&quot;. We may not like what  we hear, but that's what makes their voice so crucially important.	2000-01-25

And I fell in love with  these wonderful stories. I still have that much worn, much loved, much  dog-eared paperback on my book shelves that later in life inspired me to  read other myths of other times and places, which lead me to James Joyce,  Flannery O'Connor and T.C.Boyle and a life-long head over heels romance  with literature.  Edith Hamilton's book is a good beginning for anyone at  any age to begin, or continue, the remarkable adventure that is human story  telling.	2000-01-25

It will probably never be able to compete with the books that  assure us we are being visited by ET's, angels/demons and/or ancient  deities. People want something to believe in. &quot;Belief is the  enemy&quot;,warns Keel. How many paranormal researchers do you know would  say that? We are goldfish in a fishbowl being watched over and toyed with,  but by What? This is the question Keel will leave you with and that will  keep you staring wide eyed up at the ceiling late at night in bed...	1999-11-14

Before you come to any conclusions about UFO's and Strange Phenemenon you must read Keel. A strong dose of  critical thinking and a needed tonic between head-in-the-sand skepticism  and believe-all ET religions.	1999-10-17
