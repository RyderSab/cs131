This is by far the best book about Roman gladiators on the market for young readers. Nardo, the leading historian of ancient Rome in juvenile publishing, has done a remarable job explaining all known aspects of the fighters who fought and died in Roman arenas like the Colosseum.  He begins with a thorough, up-to-date explanation of the origins of gladiators, pointing out that scholars now think they evolved from Roman, rather than Etruscan, funeral rituals.  Then he covers recruitment, training, gladiator types, weapons, preparations for fighting, and the actual fighting (in marvelous detail). Especially valuable and riveting is a chapter on the rebellion of the gladiator Spartacus, with many details never included in other books for young people, and another chapter devoted entirely to the psychological and moral aspects of gladiators within the context of Roman society and the Roman world view.  Most of the pictures are good too and the many maps in the Spartacus chapter are very helpful. In addition, Nardo includes numerous quotes by ancient authors about gladiators and an excellent bibliography. I highly recommend the book to all.	2003-07-08

This way, each chapter sort of takes you on a tour of some part of Rome or Roman life, all in the first person, which makes the whole thing more interesting and appealing.

Don Nardo, by far the best historical writer for young people in the U.S., takes full advantage of the clever format by talking to the reader as if he or she was visitng Athens in the year 340 B.C., not long before the city of was defeated by Macedonia's King Philip, father of Alexander the Great.  It's very detailed but never boring, and offers both students and adults a refreshing look at a subject that is often presented in a dry manner in schools.  I highly recomend it!	2003-05-22

It is a collection of short biographies of the major playwrights of that day, including Shakespeare (who is given no more space and weight than the others. But their brevity does not cause the author to skimp on detail. Each biography gives the main facts of the playwright's life and also captures something of his personality, likes and dislikes, and frailties. A perfect supplementary work for general high school and undergraduate college English classes that cover Shakespeare and his age.	2003-05-19

This is by far the best bio of Hitler written for students that I am aware of (and I have read everything I can get my hands on about the subject).  In a relatively small amount of space the  author crams a huge amount of detailed information, all of it both appropriate and fascinating.  Frequent references to the dictator's physical attributes, voice, bearing, personal fears, strange fetishes, tantrums, etc., all documented by eyewitness accounts, make this slice of history come alive for the reader. I am looking forward to reading other books by this fine historian.	2003-05-17

John Eisenhower's &quot;So Far from God&quot; and John Weems' &quot;To Conquer a Peace&quot; are good choices for those wanting a more in-depth look at the war, but for those shopping for a quicker, easier read, Nardo's book really fills the bill.	2002-08-09

It covers the plot and characters and themes and so forth, all in very thoughtful and easy to read prose. My first introduction to Hamlet was the movie with Mel Gibson that came out a few years back. In the book, the author, Don Nardo, talks about how a person's first Hamlet stays with him and colors the way he sees the play ever after, and I have to agree that he's right. Later I went out and rented the version with Laurence Olivier, which by the way is a really great film, and while I was watching it I found myself comparing it to the one with Mel Gibson. Anyway, Nardo's book is crammed with interesting information and well worth looking for at your local library.	2002-08-09

I must say that after reading this book I realize there is a lot more to the topic of cloning than I thought there was.  It's written for young people, but it's so thorough and well written that just about anybody will enjoy it.  Be warned that the book doesn't take any particular side on this contraversial issue.  It gives opinions from both sides and lets the reader decide for himself.  I hartily recomend it to anybody interested in this subject.  Let's face it, pretty soon somebody is bound to clone a person, and it's better to be well-informed about it when it happens than full of misconceptions, which this book helps clear up.	2002-03-07

High school and undergraduate college students will find it easy to read, yet highly informative and valuable. I do question the book's title, though. The book covers events up to the Roman conquest of Greece in the second century B.C., which was well before the start of the Roman Empire. So why is it called Rise of the Roman Empire? This is a minor point, I admit, considering that the book is so well done.	2002-03-07

It's short, the cover is unappealing, it doesn't have any footnotes, and a lot of pictures are old black and white drawings rather than photographs of actual Greek places.

For any fan of wrestling, amateur or professional, this is the best general history of the sport for students and general readers that I know of.  It goes way back to ancient Egypt and and the Greeks and explains in detail about how they invented or perfected most of the holds and throws used in modern wrestling.  The book also does a terrific job of tracing the development of the sport through the middle ages to early modern England, and from there to colonial America (where George Washington was known for being a champion wrestler!!!).  It also tells how amateur and professional wrestling diverged in the late 1800s and early 1900s and how the professionals started out wrestling for real but later resorted to fakery.  I recommend this book to all those who enjoy wrestling or just watching it, and also to sports fans in general.	2002-01-26

This book has a short but excellent text that ably summarizes the main reasons that the American whites defeated the Native American tribes in the nineteenth century.  Racial bigotry, religious intolerance, broken treaties, application of superior weaponry, treachery and duplicity, and several other factors are examined in a frank manner that does not attempt to whitewash or cover up the systematic abuses of the American government.  Yet the author does not make the Indians look like helpless victims.  Rather, he shows that they were capable, courageous fighters who were simply overwhelmed by the larger numbers and firepower of the whites.  A very informative and useful book that all high school students should be required to read.	2001-12-24

This is an outstanding anthology of articles about the ancient world, each article written by an expert in the age or society in question.

Also covered are civilizations in other parts of the world and their achievements in the same time period, including Egypt, China, India, Africa, and Central America. There is also a chapter on important religious developments in classical times, such as the emergence of Buddhism in India and the early days of Christianity in the Mediterranean region.  The introductory article by the editor, noted historian Don Nardo, which ties togehter all these threads in one coherent narrative, is also excellent,and the bibliography is large and very helpful.

For those who were born after 1960 and have never watched old science fiction films on TV, the above words are those spoken by the heroine in &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; to stop the alien robot Gort from destroying the world.  Nardo mentions this classic film in this excellent study of twentieth-century reports of flying saucers and aliens.  He points out that the plot of the film was copied subsequently by several people claiming to have made contact with the saucer people (hence their name: the &quot;contactees&quot;).  Just about all the aliens these people described looked and talked like the leading actor in the movie and also claimed to be on earth for the same sort of mission: to end war and save humankind from destroying itself!  In other chapters, Nardo shows, in surprising deatil, how other events and trends in society and the popular media colored the saucer reports, which changed dramtically over the years.  To me, this shows that the phenomenon is more a figment of society's imagination and fears than anything real.  This is a fascinationg, very well researched book that both high school and adult readers will enjoy and benefit from.	2001-09-08

I figured &quot;what the hell?&quot; and gave it a look, not expecting much, since after all it was written for kids.  But I was wrong, at leat partially.  It WAS witten in such a way that kids will get a lot out of it.  But actually ANYBODY will get a lot out of it because it is loaded with information about just about every aspect of the play.  In fact, I would say that even though the book is short, I got more useful information out of it than from some of the more advanced ones I looked out.  The author writes in very clear language and covers all the main points, and also makes the reader understand why the play is so good and so famous and important.  So I am giving the author five stars for a first-rate job of explaining a difficult subject.	2001-09-08

However, even though I was put off by this when I first thumbed through the book, when I actually began reading it my opinion changed.  It is one of the very best summaries I've seen of Disney's life and work, and I've read several.  It's very well written and sometimes even moving, and it goes into a lot of the background stories about him and his brother, Roy, who was always worried that the company might go broke becauase Walt tended to spend so much money.  As the author points out several times, Walt knew that he had to spend a lot of money to get the level of quality that the Disney name has come to stand for.  Everybody interested in Walt Disney should definitely read this book.	2001-09-02

Well, many of the sports that are popular today came from the ancient Greeks for one thing, like wrestling and track and many track and field events, and boxing too. This book tells just about everythig about these ancient sports but also about the more violent Roman ones, like when gladiators killed eachother in front of screaming crowds. It makes you look at movies like Gladiator in a new light. I really liked the book and it's one anybody can learn a lot from.	2001-08-29

And I have seen numerous versions of this great play, as well as attended a college seminar about it. So I naturally figured that I knew it extremely well. Here is a short but simply wonderful book that has reminded me that there are always new things to learn about Hamlet. It's aimed at young readers, but is so well written and insightful that an old hack like me could not put it down. I wish this author would write a volume like this about every one of Shakespeare's plays. I've never seen the Bard explained better than this.	2001-08-29

The librarian told me it was in the children's section, but that the author's books are so well written and highly documented that adults can use them too. And she was right. This book contains a wealth of information about gladiators, chariot races, and other Roman games, all done in a methodical, thorough, but consistently entertaining manner. Extensive footnotes, a good many of them informational, and a large bibliography add to the value of the volume. Meanwhile, I discovered that the author, Don Nardo, has written extensively about Rome's fall. His Decline and Fall of Ancient Rome (which borrows its title from Edward Gibbon's masterpiece), is also excellent and I plan to review it separately.	2001-08-29

This volume like his others that I have read and at times used in my classes, is extremely thorough, well-researched, and skillfully written. He begins by giving the readers, who are for the most part uninitiated in the subject, an effective overview of how historians, past and present, have viewed and approached the subject of Rome's fall. Then he explores the long and torturous process by which the Roman Empire declined during the course of more then three centuries, focusing on numerous, often interrelated causes, including economic decay, poor leadership, changing social attitudes, religious upheaval, and of course, the barbarian invasions. This is by far the best non-scholarly book available on the subject and every high school history teacher who covers Rome should either make it required reading or recommend it for report-writing.	2001-08-28

As prolific as Michael Grant, as versatile as Chester G. Starr, and as thorough as A.H.M. Jones (for non-history buffs, three of the leading ancient historians of the twentieth century), Nardo has devoted several years of his time and energy to improving, and indeed single-handedly setting, the standard of historical writing for books used as reference in libraries in schools in the United States. As a former high school and junior college instructor, I have had frequent occasion to scan, review, and sometimes utilize such books in my classes, and I can testify that, with some rare exceptions, most are written by non-specialists who have little idea of what to emphasize in their texts or how to differentiate between current and dated material. These volumes are typically riddled with factual errors or at least misleading statements that students writing reports and other papers accept without question and which I have found myself correcting on a regular basis. Nardo's books, in contrast, are factually reliable and cover their subjects with thoughtful attention to organization, proper emphasis, and inclusion of the most recent available data. This general overview of Greek civilization is no exception. It combines a feeling of epic sweep with meticulous attention to detail, much of the latter dealing with archaeological finds and how these have contributed to our knowledge of Greek history and culture. His companion volumes in the same series-one on the Romans, the other on ancient Mesopotamia-are equally good for the same reasons. In addtion, his fulsome &quot;Complete History of Ancient Greece,&quot; containing huge amounts of extremely valuable reference material, is a must for every school and community library.	2001-08-28

His discussion of Roman roads, aqueducts, and bridges is extremely well researched, clearly written, and his many details and anecdotes about how people used these facilities is highly entertaining. Included are discussions of tunnels through mountainsides and the difficulties of keeping them straight, the probelm of people diverting and stealing water from the aqueducts (and the penalities they received when caught), the gangs of slaves who maintained these facilities (with tomb epitaphs they left behind), the scaffolding used by Roman construction workers, and much much more. Along with Nardo's other books, this one deserves to be in every library and classroom.	2001-08-24

OK, maybe he wasn't the world's greatest actor, but he had a larger than life presence on the screen and was a hell of a father and good citizen off the screen.  The author goes to great lengths to cover all these different aspects of the Duke's life and also tells a lot of backstage stories that are fascinating. I agree with the author that his best performance was in The Searchers.  Everybody should read this book.	2001-08-24

In this case, it's ancient Greece that declines and falls.  The book consists of a series of essays by well-known historians who give a fnely detailed synopsis of the centuries in which the Greeks fought each other to the point where they were too weak to stand up to the Romans.  The list of books in the bibliograpy is huge and helpful for those looking for more information on the subject.	2001-08-24

This is certainly one of the better ones.  Noted classical historian and literay scholar Don Nardo has compiled an impressive array of essays by other scholars, including Sarah Pomeroy, Michael Grant, Moses Hadas, D.W. Lucas, and Victor Hanson.  Each covers a different aspect of the Greek drama, such as its basis in mythology, the use of the chorus, the nature of Grek tragedy, the potrayal of women, Greek comedy, the importance of Oedipus Rex in the later history of drama, and so on.  A very fine bibliography rounds out this excellent resource.	2001-08-24

Unfortunately, most of the really informative books available on Homer are scholarly. And while some of these-C.M. Bowra's 1972 book and those by Jasper Griffin, among others, readily come to mind- are wonderful, they are beyond the reach of average readers with little or no background in Greek literature and culture. Nardo's literary companion successfully aims at a wider audience, explaining in clear, methodical terms the basics the layman needs to know to appreciate the subject. He then presents a wide range of short, but pointed discussions of various aspects of Homer and his works by noted scholars. This is a thoughtful, informative, balanced presentation by an expert who is not afraid to reach out to the uninitiated and attempt to instill in them an appreciation for a subject often sadly neglected in today's educational and social settings.	2001-08-24

Young people and older people alike can't help but walk away from reading this book with a clear idea of what the play is about and its importance in the annals of Western literature. It brings Hamlet, which some people assume is dry and unintersting, to life, and I recommend it to anyone interested in Shakespeare and in fact anyone who thinks they aren't interested in Shakespeare.	2001-08-24

First of all, it doesn't take sides, but presents viewpoints from both sides of the issue, which is obviously a controversial one.  I like the way the author shows how the saucer and alien reports evolved and changed over the years, reflecting social and political changes in the USA and the world.  The book was written for young people but almost anybody will be able to learn something from it.	2001-08-24

But these are scholarly and are difficult for students and gneral readers with no background in Roman history. Don Nardo has done a tremendous job here of distilling the main points of the subject in a compact volume for beginners. His explanations of Roman battle tactics are extremely well informed and easy to understand, and several useful diagrams of battle formations and specific battles help make this treatment one of the best existing ones, despite its brevity. As a Roman buff, I recommend it highly.	2001-08-24

It tells about the way the Roman republic had trouble with its military generals, who used their armies to challenge the government, and finally that government got so weak it fell, and the Roman empire rose up in its place.  There's a lot of stuff in there about the war between Cleopatra and Mark Anthony and Octavian (who was related to Julius Caesar), including a very detailed section on the big sea battle that Octavian won.  It's really a good book that somebody can read for enjoyment as wellas doing reports for clases.	2001-08-24

Greece.  Most books I have seen for young people (as well as quite a few for adults) deal mainly with the cultural aspects of the age (e.g. the Parthenon, Athenian playwrights, etc.), whereas this volume also deals in surprising detail and insight with the politcal and military events of the period, including the ongoing rivalry between Athens and Sparta, and carefully traces the roots as well as the consequences of that rivalry.  Nardo must be commended for a successful attempt to educate young readers about a pivotal period in Western history, one in which arrogance, an imperialistic mentality, and miscalculation helped to destroy the world's first democracy.  Adults, excluding scholars of of course, will benefit from the book, too.	2001-08-24

I spend quite a bit of time on the Greeks and Romans, of course, and I have used a number of Mr. Nardo's small but superbly written and well-documented books in the past as supplementary materials to the regular text.  His LIFE IN ANCIENT ATHENS, AGE OF AUGUSTUS, LIFE OF A ROMAN SLAVE, LEADERS OF ANCIENT GREECE, and several others have proved invaluable as sources of information for both my students and myself.  Mr. Nardo's more recent COMPLETE HISTORY OF ANCIENT GREECE, which I'm reviewing here, is easily the best single-volume overview of the ancient Greeks I ever seen for this age group.  Though much larger and more comprehensive than his other books for young readers, this one is extremely well-organized, both chronologically and thematically.  The essays he has chosen and edited are all clearly-written, highly informative, and each perfectly captures or illustrates an important aspect of Greek history or culture.  Nardo's own quite fulsome chapter introductions are also very informative, well-written, and up-to-date.  The appendices of this book also deserve special mention.  The glossary is huge and accurate, the best available in any non-scholarly book about ancient Greece that I am aware of.  The bibliography is also massive, again, the biggest and best I've seen outside of scholarly works.  ...  it is also proving a tremendous aid to me personally by giving me one, compact source from which to draw facts, topics, and ideas. Would that more professional historians took the time to write as much first-rate material for high school students as Mr. Nardo does.	2001-05-25

He does the same thing in this excellent, well organized, and extremely well documented volume on the War of 1812.  Mr. Nardo's prose is always lively, but in some parts of this book, notably the famous &quot;great chase&quot; of Old Ironsides by some British warships and the American naval victories on the Great Lakes, his descriptiions are better termed rousing, suspenseful, and uplifting.

The author tells it like it is, or was to be more precise, without trying to gloss over the bad parts, for instance where Americans were lawbreakers, greedy, and sometimes warlike and brutal in their relations with the Mexicans.  Those are the disturbing parts, because today we don't like to hear that our country can do things that we normally associate with guys like Saddam Hussain.  But the story has to be told because it did happen and forgetting about the past is a big mistake, as some scholar once pointed out.  For those who are unhappy about George W.

They should read this book and find out what this guy did to make sure the country got its hands on Texas and California.	2001-05-23

I can't say enough good things about this terrific little book that tells so very much about the play that many people consider the greatest ever written.  Nardo, a noted historian and literary scholar, provides loads of valuable information about Shakespeare and his times, about the background of HAMLET (including the sources on which Shakespeare based it), the plot, a really fascinating chapter dissecting the characters (including several of the minor ones), and a chapter discussing the main themes, all in a very straightforward, easy to understand style.  The bibliography is also first rate, pointing the way to most of the best sources out there about the play.  This book is &quot;must read&quot; for students, but believe me, adults will get a lot out of it too, espcially those who don't think they're very much interested in Shakespeare.  This book will open wide the door to enjoyment of Shakespeare for such people.  I have noticed that Amazon lists several other Shakespeare volumes by this author.  I have not read any of them yet, but I fully intend to.	2001-05-22

Like his previously published book titled &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; (borrowed from English historian Edward Gibbon's famous masterpiece)this book deals with the the long decline of the Roman realm over several centuries, only in this one Nardo mostly edits essays written by other scholars, all of them well-known and resepcted.  Students and anyone of any age interested in ancient Rome will find this book an excellent source of information and, for that matter, just a plain good read.	2001-05-22

Extremely well-organized, thorough, and informational, the volume covers all aspects of Greek history and culture, each aspect covered in a separate chapter that begins with a helpful introduction by the editor.  The articles themselves also have introductions providing brief backgrounds of the various contributors.  A chronology, glossary, bibliography, and indexes, all quite large and useful (especially the bibliography, which is one of the best I've ever seen for ancient Greece), round out this first-rate volume, which I highly recommend to students and teachers alike.	2001-05-21

I have had the good fortune to use some of them in teaching my high school history classes.  I was not aware until now, however, that he is equally versed in American history.  Most people today do not remember the Mexican War.  That is probably due in part to the fact that it was a shameful affair, in which the United States quite literally launched an essentially unprovoked military aggression against a neighboring country, mainly out of greed for land and deep-seated racial and ethnic bias.  Though Nardo does not take sides, since he is writing for studnets and must remain impartial, he allows the facts to speak for themselves.  And those facts nearly leap from the pages.  Numerous passages from books, newspapers, and official documents of the times provide copious documentaion worthy of scholarly history books (although Nardo is always careful to keep the writing clear and easy to understand).  It is difficult, after reading this superlative treatment of the war, and especially the events leading up to it, to think about Texas in the same way I used to.  The way this country acquired it was and will always remain a stain on American honor.  Nardo must be congratulated for a job exceedinly well done.	2001-04-07

The title of this book caught my eye when I was scanning Amazon's listings for books about theater history, so I got a copy.  I have to admit that I didn't know all that much about ancient theater before reading it. It really opened my eyes.  It is really a kind of revalation to find out that almost every aspect of modern theater, including playwriting, acting, costumes, and so on were pioneered by the ancient Greeks.  According to the author (Don Nardo) they even came up with the idea of theater tickets.  It kind of humbles you to think there's really not much new under the sun, as the old saying goes.  The sections of the book on Roman theater are REALLY fascinating.  I can definitely recomend this book to all theater students or those who admire acting, plays, and movies.	2001-04-07

The constant rise and fall of empires in the old Middle East comes out very clearly, with also a lot of interesting detail about Assyrian art, sculpture and architecture.  Nardo, who writes more often about ancient Greece and Rome, does his usual best in making ancient times come to life. I recommend this book to anybody intersted in ancient history or the Middle East in general.	2001-04-07

The author has aimed the book at younger readers, but he doesn't skimp on detail.  There are also numerous quoted passages from either the ancient themsleves or modern historians commenting on them.  The book is also very strong on explaining how archaeologists dug up the region and discovered palaces, writing tablets, and other artifacts.  This book will be useful for school kids but is also fascinating reading for adults too.  According to Amazon, the author has written other books about ancient history, which having enjoyed this one so much I definitely plan to read.	2001-04-07

By far the best general synopsis of the subject available for young or non-scholarly readers.  Nardo covers every major aspect of ancient Greek and Roman sports and games, sometimes in a good deal more detail than one would expect in a book for this reading level.  The sections describing ancient Olympia, Greek combat sports (wrestling, boxing, and pancration), and Roman chariot racing are especially informative and colofully written.  This book should be on the required reading list for all high-school and college students taking courses in ancient history.	2001-04-07

The author devotes most of the book to Philip, rather than his illustrius son, Alexander, which is Ok because there are plenty of books about Alexander out there already.  It is really refreshing to find out how much of Alexnader's accomplishments were the result of his father's talent and achievements, which tend to get glossed over in a lot of books about Alexander.  As one of the reviews above mentions, the author does a really nice job of working in actual quotes from ancient writers, which gives the book a strong feeling of authenticity.	2001-04-07

There's a lot of stuff out there on Cleo, some of it good and some of it not so good, but this one has to be one of the best.  The editor, Don Nardo, a noted historian, and has compiled an impressive assortment of articles written by other scholars on Cleo's life and times and even about modern movies about her.  Also, Nardo's bibliograpy is excellent and gives readers plenty of material to search out.	2001-04-07

This one is no exception.  From the strikingly attractive cover to Nardo's well-worded retellings of the myths, to his expert commentary, to the fulsome bibliography, this volume is a must for junior high and high school students seeking a rounded education in the history of Western culture and literature.  Taechers will no doubt use this book with confidence and constructive results.	2001-03-01

It tells about the history of the Roman army, and how young Roman men enlisted, and their lives in the army camps, and their weapons, and how they lined up and fought on the battlefield, and even how the Roman army went downhill and eventually fell apart after too many barabarians joined the ranks.  Also in the book are some nice diagrams of important battles and also one of a typical army camp.  Best of all, the author tells the names of all the important books aver written on the subject! (in a list in the back) The whole thing was very well done.	2001-03-01

This book by noted American historian Don Nardo, along with his equally excellent volumes on the Greek Parthenon, life in ancient Greece, the Punic Wars, the Roman Empire, and Roman slavery, proved extremely useful to me and those of my students who read them.  Personally, this one was my favorite.  I plan to use more of his books in the future and I heartily recommend these volumes to other teachers.	2001-03-01

Though the reading level of this book is aimed at young people, the author's style is straightforward enough and there is enough detailed information about the subject for me to recommend it to adults.  I have read numerous books about flying saucers, some of them very good and most terrible!  This is by far one of the best, partly because it doesn't just consist of the typical series of saucer sightings and abduction stories, but is instead a rounded and fascinating history of the UFO phenomenon.

It's loaded with good information about the Romans and tells how modern scholars discovered these facts.  It's written for school kids but there's more than enough meat in there for adults to get some real value too.  I looked up the author and found that he has written many other books about Rome and other ancient peoples, and I plan to find and read some of these too.	2001-03-01

It consists of a bunch of articles written by various scholars about the book &quot;Frankenstien&quot; (by Mary Shelley), that does not mean that they are too scholarly for the average person to understand.  As a matter of fact they are all very easy to read.  The editor (Don Nardo) also included a helpful overview of Mary Shelley's life in the front of the book.  He also has an excellent bibliogrophy telling the reader many other books to check about Frankenstein and Mary Shelley.	2001-03-01

Nardo does a great job of telling how the document came about and gives a lot of information about Jefferson and where he got the ideas for writing the Declaration.  Also included are numerous small but interesting facts and tidbits, like that not all the founding fathers signed the document at the same time, like they show so often in the movies and TV.  My son brought this home to do a report and I picked it up and to take a quick look at it and then I couldn't put it down.	2001-02-27

The format is a series of essays written by well-known scientists, historians and others.  The editor has done a nice job of picking readings that are easy to understand but not so easy as to be on a child's level.  There are some serious quotes in there by Darwin and his colleagues and other scientists, as well as some stuff by the creationists, who of course think evolution never happened.  This book would be good for students, but adults will get plenty out of it too.	2001-02-27

Here, he approaches an often-done subject  from a fresh viewpoint.  Instead of focusing most of the time on Alexander and mentioning his father Philip in a mere few pages, as so many books of this kind tend to do, Nardo focuses most of the book on Philip and how in an amazingly short span of time he forged a nation out of petty competing factions in a Macedonia that was viewed by Athens and other leading Greek city-states at that time as a backward, uncultured place, and also how he created a formidable army, one that Alexander later used to conquer Persia with.  I have read just about all of the important literature in this subject area, and Nardo's is the only non-scholarly study I know of that goes into Philip's life and exploits in such detail.  The title of the book is a bit misleading, in that it could be construed by those who have not read the book to mean that the unity Philip and Alexander brought to Greece was complete and/or permanent; and I suspect that this was not Nardo's own title, but rather one imposed by the publisher.  However, throughout the book, Nardo makes it very clear that said unity was only partial (Sparta and some other Greek states not taking part), impermanent, and also achieved by brute force, since the Macedonians marched into southern Greece and imposed their will on the residents.  This is excellent, well-informed historical writing, of far better quality than some scholarly books I have seen, although admittedly couched in simple terms and language for its young audience.	2000-12-03

If you've ever wanted to do some in-depth study about ancient sporting events such as the original Olympics and chariot races and so forth, this is an excellent overview to get started.  Mr. Nardo, who has written many books for students and general readers about ancient times, has done a wonderful job of summarizing the main points about ancient Olympia (what it looked like, who went there to see the famous games, what the events were, who the athletes were, etc.) He has a whole chapter on wrestling, boxing, and similar events that I found particularly interesting, including famous stories about some of the greatest competitors in these events, such as the great Milo, who could probably defeat (if he was still alive of course!)most of today's greatest atheletes.  Mr. Nardo also does a great job explaining the Roman games, including the chariot races in the Circus Maximus and gladiator fights in the Colosseum.  As in his other books that I have seen, he provides a very large and helpful bibliography that lists more scholarly books on specific aspects of ancient sports.  Some of his photos are good too, especially the one showing the actual starting blocks for the sprinters that are still visible in the ruins at Olympia.

Mr. Nardo is a very clear writer who makes the times he is writing about come to life.  He is also a very fine historian whose work I discovered a few months ago.  I have read several of his books since that time and intend to review some of them as I am doing here.  This book about the Augustan Age covers all the major aspects of the subject.  But I especially liked the chapter on Augustus's moral crusade.  He reminds me of some of today's political and religious conservatives who get so uptight when they see people enjoying too much freedom.  Anyway, I strongly recommend this and Mr. Nardo's other books.	2000-10-08

It consists of a series of essays written by noted historians who are experts on ancient Greek history and culture.  Each essay has an introduction that tells what it is about and also tells a little about the person who wrote it, a very helpful feature.  The book was edited by Don Nardo, who is himself a fine historian.  He provides an excellent summary at the beginning of the book telling the main points that the essays later tackle in greater detail.  He also provides an excellent bibliography.  I have already begun to read two of the books he listed in it.  I have also been reading some of Mr. Nardo's other ancient history books.  Most that I have seen were aimed at students and general readers, but he uses a semi-scholarly style and includes numerous primary sources quotes and explanatory footnotes that make this and his other books very authoritative.  The Greeks declined for a lot of reasons, but mostly because they couldn't get along with each other and unite into one strong country.  Mr. Nardo makes that point strongly in his introduction and also includes one whole essay that discusses this theme of disunity.  I highly recommend this book to students and anyone else who is interested in past civilizations.	2000-10-08
