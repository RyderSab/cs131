Thomas and Margaret were of the dirt poor. Their mother took off & left them with their father who had lost their home & they had to live in a tent in the woods. He was a butcher & was always looking for work but many of the people could not pay him with money. They all went hungry. It was a very sad period. The children desided to go find their mother. When they did find her she was a kept woman & did not want them. Their father was arrested for taking back two of his things that were stolen from him by a evil man. The children did not know where he was. The only people who wanted anything to do with them only wanted the girl & they had a son who was not quite all there & all he wanted was for her to crawl into his bed with him & she was too young to know what he was doing with her. Thomas found out & both of them ran away to find the mother. It is winter, they don't have warm clothes and they were lucky to hitch a ride. You must read the book to find out what happened to them.	2005-08-03

That was before I read Suspicious Origin. This book is fantastic. It's got you from the first page. It sure makes you think. I finished it in just a few days and that was only reading a few hours a day. I just didn't want to put it down. It is very easy to get involved with all of the people in this book &amp; it keeps you guessing &amp; when it gets close to the end you can start to figure out who the killer is. Ms. MacDonald is a wonderful author but this is her best book so far.	2003-07-01
US	34736206	R1XRJRHSDLIUK	0399149759	396777762	Flashback (Barr, Nevada)	Books	4	3	4	N	N	letters are great	I love Nevada Barr &amp; have all of her books. But this one was not her best. It starts out very slow. But poor Anna is almost killed again near the beginning of the book. But the best part of this book are the letters from her great-great Aunt. If fact they were so good that I read them to the end &amp; then went back &amp; read the story about Anna. This poor woman is almost killed at least 3 times in this story. The beginning is slow. It starts to pick up around the middle but the last of the book is so good you can't put it down. Even though it is not her best it is still a good book.	2003-06-27

She is young, living with her widower father &amp; a wonderful woman who takes care of them. Then came Nora &amp; the story just takes off. Page after page it just gets better. When I finished the book I kept checking to see if there was more. I didn't want it to end. It is full of surprises. If you want to read a book that totally grips you through the whole book read Nora, Nora. <br />Anne Rivers Siddons is one the the top writers. Everybook she writes it great. Totally looking forward to her next book.	2003-03-25
