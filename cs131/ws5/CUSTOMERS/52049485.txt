Going from a \\"believer\\" in Marxism to a \\"beleiver' in a higher power, he has over-simplified the argument for atheism as 'random occurrences' and seems to speak only in absolutes, something which goes completely against my learned-from-experience and scientific approach to life, & philosophy; if one wants to be comforted and lulled into validation of their prejudices and 'faiths', then this would be the book of the year for you; if however, you are a discerning, thinking, skeptical, analytical, and objective reader, you can easily debunk without any other special tools or sophistry any and all of his wholly holy holey 'arguments', for examples abound, for instance, of people who HAVE changed the world, for better or for worse, even this author cites one of them [in his disguise as the US] for 'freeing' the people of Iraq from the dictator and mass-murderer that the US installed and kept in place as long as it suited US purposes, so right in this example, we have the author contradicting himself, since both Bush AND Saddam are perfect examples of the bankruptcy of the thesis that \\"one person cannot change the world\\"<br /><br />If you like circular 'thinking', or are prone to it, you will find an eloquent yet facile friend here.<br /><br />Save your money for true original thinker-doers who have something to offer, say Ralph Nader, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Doris Lessing, Noam Chomsky, Michael Parenti, and last but not least Howard Zinn, ALL prominent examples that disprove the thesis of this book; because Mr Horowitz has proved to be an intellectual failure does not mean that anyone should follow him down this same dead-end.rowitz has proved to be an intellectual failure does not mean that anyone should follow him down this same dead-end.	2005-05-29

The definitive well-researched biography focusing on the first woman doctor in America. The many changes of scene and of fortune in Blackwell's life, combined with her penchant for seeking new challenges, make her a lively biography subject. <br />Up against the limitations of American medicine in the early 1800s  & how women suffered at the hands of male physicians, came, from a close-knit family of Dissenters who emigrated from England, a single-minded young woman determined to become a surgeon. A few physicians rallied to her cause, becoming sponsors, but no medical schools would admit her except, eventually, Geneva Medical College of Western New York, and that was actually the result of a joke. The many personal and professional hurdles that Blackwell had to overcome in order to succeed are detailed in this well-documented narrative, preesented within the context of her social and intellectual milieu, her teaching career, and the community of medicine during her lifetime.	2005-04-17

Use it or lose  it... As Bill was too modest to point out in his brief comment above,  Howard Zinn, renowned author of &quot;The Peoples History of the US&quot;  ringingly endorses this personal history that is interwoven with the major  events of the 20th century, both national and international, with this  statement (excerpted): &quot;...the greatness of the US rests not  on its  wealth or power, but in the courage of those who continued to insist that  the principles of the Declaration of Independence be fulfilled -the equal  right of all people to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. In this  long struggle, the ideas and actions of people like Bill Mandel have played  an important part...his life story is not only dramatic, but instructive  and inspiring.&quot;  Well worth the money, time and effort to read, nay  study, this role-model for our generation!
