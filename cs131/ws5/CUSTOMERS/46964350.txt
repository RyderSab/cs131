It is hard to believe the author  of this 1983 non-fiction,Luigi Barzini was born (in Milan) 12/21/1908  not that people don't often get more contemporary as they grow older but there are no 'cliches' in what I've read from this 'borrowed' book and since he has several books to his credit,it is also to his credit that he didn't let hapless writing habits creep in.	2002-01-14

Although you're almost sure from the beginning who'll win, the book has enough slapstick humor to make you want to go the route with them as the baddies feel they've got their scheme in place this time.	2001-08-13
