Domestic abuse seems to be an overlooked subject in urban fiction books and Azarel has presented a fast-paced story focusing on this very real issue. She takes us into the relationship of Carlie and Devon and the many abuses present in their relationship. Although Carlie is young and pretty with a supportive family, she continues to allow Devon to emotionally and physically break her down. As her self esteem plummets and she turns to alchohol for solice, her family tries to rescue her. Is Carlie strong enough to escape the ruthless Devon or will she remain bruised?<br /><br />This was a good read that I recommend specifically to females 13-21. Hopefully reading about Carlie's plight will prevent them from becoming another statistic. A great lesson in life, what else would you expect from 'Life Changing Books'.<br /><br />Englishruler<br />ARC Book Club Inc.<br />Star Rating: 4.5	2005-09-21

Within days she loses her innocence to her new husband, forty-five year old Lama Contravene and is moved to America under the pretense she is going to school.<br /><br />Fatou's world is turned upside down when she realizes she was deceived and would not be continuing her studies, but be forced to grow up before her time, under Lama's control. Lama gets Fatou a job braiding hair at Fifi's braid Shop. It is at Fifi's where Fatou meets people and gains the confidence that would allow her to break free.

With two beautiful children and substantial careers only one thing hinders their relationship - Greg's constant cheating. Tired of turning a blind eye to the infidelities, Rena finally admits there's a problem. She sets up an appointment and the couple go to counseling as a last ditch effort to save their marriage. Dr. Pamplin's advice: bring another woman into the bedroom so Rena can see what interests<br />her man!<br /><br />Whoa! Author Torrian Ferguson certainly `kicks it up a notch' with this fast-paced read. The title alone lets you know sex is a factor, but scenes in this book will have you doing anything from cringing to blushing and maybe even congratulating the characters for releasing their sexual inhibitions. Torrian has shown he has a knack for writing erotica and attention grabbing fiction, but given the subject of this book, I would like to have seen more reference to safe sex than just a single condom out of many escapades.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the story flowed nicely with the exception of a few instances when the author flips from first person point of view to third. The plot was intriguing, I wanted to follow and understand each characters motives, so I was disappointed when at one point Greg sets up a tryst with another key character and the book continues with no follow up on the subject. Even still the ending was neatly wrapped up and has me wondering what will be next from Torrian Ferguson. There's no doubt about it, `Swingers' is a page turner and lovers of the genre will find a new favorite in it.<br /><br />Englishruler<br />ARC Book Club Inc.<br />Star Rating: 4 stars	2005-06-12

Unique was definitely a charactar that could have had her own book. Roy Glenn was next on the scene with 'Nina'. This story was okay, but did not hold much weight coming after Nikki's story. Finally we have Chunichi's 'Anyeh'. I like the premise of the story, however it was not executed strongly enough. I have heard great things about her full length novel 'A Gangta's Girl', and intend to read that sometime in the near future. Carl Weber treated readers to a very short erotic story at the end of the book. I am not used to reading that kind of story from Carl and it sort of shocked me in a way - it was very 'Zane-like'.

Gray (Booty Call). The story focuses on life long friends Promise, Squeeze, Show and Pooh. Born and raised in the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y, these cats are focused on getting what they want from whoever is caught slipping, afterall that's what stick-up kids do!<br /><br />The stakes have been raised for Promise who obtains full custody of his three year old daughter after her mother is brutally murdered. He must decide if he is going to continue in a lifestyle that threatens his daughters well being or pull out of his crew and risk losing his friends.<br /><br />This book was broken down into three parts, each author being responsible for for one. 'Wild Side' written in third person gives us insight on Promise and his relationship with his daughter. 'Ride or Die Chick' written in first person female voice, proves to be the most exciting and well-written section.(Kudos to Mark Anthony....who said men can't write from a females perspective?) The final entry, 'One Block To Go', was written in first person male voice and was a tad confusing  with the flashbacks of the speaking charactar.<br /><br />This book held good rhythm up to 'One More Block' which I feel threw off the balance of the story. Without giving too much away, I feel \\"that charactar\\" should not have been \\"talking\\" at that point in the story. Also, many of the facts that the reader discovers are irrelevent at that time.<br /><br />Overall, the story was entertaining. Despite minor typos (more so toward the end of the book), it held my attention.

I don't know but I am ready and waiting!	2004-05-17

Definately a fast-paced story, 'Blinded' takes you through life in the eyes of Mona. Neglected by her mom at an early age, Mona believes all she needs to do is get a high school diploma and everything else after that will come by ways of her good looks. Determined not to be like her mother, Mona steers clear of prostitution and drugs. Extremeley book smart she does not carry that same intelligence over to her relationships with men. She is easily manipulated and forgets her morals when she starts on the same path her mother once took. I enjoyed reading 'Blinded'  and I especially liked that it was told in Mona's voice. I am looking forward to 'Grimey'.	2004-05-13

Although the cover was not appealing to me, the bookstore clerk said it was the bomb! He was not lying. Despite being a bit confusing the way it was written in first and third person, it turned out to be a very exciting read. I like the way Ms. Campbell used the story to show that 'it really is a small world after all'. Good story with unbelievable sex thrown in for good measure!  More like  4.5 stars. There is one charactar in particular that will have you saying 'Oh hell naw'!! This one is a keeper. Hats off to Denise Campbell!!!!	2004-04-20
US	27606834	RKWNEGOFF3SPW	0967054214	962958648	Push	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Relentless Indeed!	'PUSH' is one of the best books in its genre. Relentless Aaron has penned an urban masterpiece with this intriguing story full of suspense and underhanded schemes. This book will have you rapidly turning the pages and begging for more at the end. Talk about on the edge! This authors unique writing style played with my head at times! For me, the story in itself reconfirms the fact that life really is about the choices we make. The choices that Push and Asondra make are crucial. 'PUSH' left me in a rut!! I need more from this author. But that should be no problem, I hear he has 29 more! I haven't read them yet so I'm on a mission. In the meantime be I'll be two down after I read 'The Last Kingpin'. I expect another devious tale and I know I won't be dissapointed.<br /><br />(...)	2004-04-08
US	27606834	RH9DTIV9DYSC4	1585711101	539087593	Shades of Brown (Love Spectrum Romance)	Books	1	5	7	N	N	Boring	This was a book club selection so I had to read it. I knew the outcome of the story before I was even half way through. The characters are completely shallow, and the whole color thing did not make sense to me being that Meg grew up in their black household! I could point out quite a few things but overall....I feel this would have made an o.k. Lifetime movie. But it was a waste of time to read. I would not reccomend this to anyone...period.	2004-04-02

After seeing this book on the internet for many months, I finally purchased it. I have to say, I was extremely dissapointed. It certainly did not live up to all the hype. The characters just did nothing for me! This not one of those books that make you want to read it again!	2004-04-02
US	27606834	R35SWO8L5JU7V9	0974805114	229786514	Every Thug Needs a Lady	Books	4	2	3	N	N	What Happened?!	After reading 'Thugs and the Women Who Love Them', I could not wait to get my hands on the sequel. I am sorry to say this book did not live up to my expectations. Wahida stated in the foreword that her publishing company was changing owners, and as a result, the first 20,000 copies (one of which I purchased) would be raw and uncut. In other words, there were [adult] scenes that needed to be cut and some grammatical errors. That was ok with me, afterall it does say RAW and UNCUT right on the cover. The problem I had was that there was not enough mention of Jazz's pending trial. And it seems to me like if Snake was this big time pimp, why didn't anyone miss him? Even Angel made it seem like there was no skin off her back when the man who pays for her schooling and everything else just up and dissapeared. But the most unbeleivable part of the story is the epilogue when it comes to Jazz's fate and the suprise ending. I just don't get it!!! (If you read part one you understand!) For real, it seemed like Wahida forgot about Jazz's situation and just threw it in at the end. I won't hate too much though, Wahida is a talented sistah. I look forward to more from her.<br /><br />Englishruler<br />ARC Book Club Inc.<br />Star Rating: 4 stars	2004-04-02

Annette's story continues in this sequel to 'God Don't Like Ugly', and this story is worth reading in my eyes. From reuniting with her father and meeting her bi-racial siblings, to her 'comfortable' relationship with the ever present Pee Wee, Annette faces new ugliness. And not suprisingly, some from her past.  She proved herself strong from part one. And to me she is every woman! I definately enjoyed this continuation, but as always part one takes the cake! Mary Monroe fans old and new will be pleased.	2004-01-28

She's a successful news reporter, he's a wealthy attorney. Both are attractive and out to get what they want. Being Lenoxs' \\"woman\\" seems easy. When Farah realizes he can take her to higher places, she thinks she can take what he dishes out. Comprimising their morals, they use each other; and in the end some one's got to lose....or do they?<br />After reading 'Sex and the Single Sister', I loved the extension and development of Farah's character. Although I didn't quite grasp the ending, I would read another novel by Ms. Reid. I also like that she stayed true to real life situations.	2004-01-10

I saw this book every time I went to the bookstore, but was reluctant to buy it, being that I had never heard of Mary Monroe. Also no one I knew had read it. After seeing 'God still don't like ugly' I decided to take the plunge! I am so glad I did. I really appreciate Ms. Monroe's writing style and the depth of her characters. I like that although Annette was abused, she was not portrayed as dumb and helpless. And even after forming a bond with Rhoda, Annette knew when to let go of her coat tail, and stand alone. I would recommend this story of abuse,friendship, and secrecy to anyone who appreciates a good novel. I enjoyed reading this book and was sad when it ended. The only good thing about it is... now I can read 'God still don't like Ugly\\"!!!	2003-12-04
US	27606834	R2EIITZNWU7AM2	0972277102	370795798	The Choices Men Make	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Not Bad!!!	Having never heard of Dwayne S. Joseph, I purchased this book after seeing the on-line rating being an average of 4 stars. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this book as much as some of the other readers. Although the book was fast-paced and easy to read, I feel the author could have included more than he did. I would also liked to have seen more interaction between Roy and his wife. Also, I would not have picked that name for the title. (But now I'm just being picky!!!) Overall it was o.k. If you're just looking for a quick read to kill some time, this may be for you. Honestly I preferred Electa Rome Parks &quot; Ties that Bind&quot;. However, I don't give up on this author. He has alot of potential!	2003-11-17

But I guess my expectations were too high!! Although I enjoyed reading the book, in my opinion it was predictable. After reading Addicted I am suprised the story went in the direction it did. Nevertheless, I am still a fan of Zane and look forward to  something &quot;different&quot; in her future works.	2003-10-04

It sucked me in from the first page and did not spit me out until the very end. I like the way the book was written and the characters he created. He also showed that even though J.C was a rough neck, he also had a soft side. The only complaint I have is that in the scene in where J.C and Champagne meet for the first time, the actions that take place are not the norm! Overall, I enjoyed reading his first novel and look forward to his future works.<br /><br />Englishruler<br />ARC Book Club Inc.<br />Star Rating: 4 Stars	2003-09-17

Besides being well written, this book was suspenseful, had well developed characters, a twist, and to top it off there is a moral to the story. Buy this book, you won't be dissapointed.	2003-09-05
