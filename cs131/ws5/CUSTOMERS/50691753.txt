Her regencies are good but this is a contemporary and different standards apply.  Why is the heroine a virgin?  Why is there a 13 year gap between her and the hero?  This reads like a bad mills and boon from the early 80's.  They were part of their time and place but this book has no excuse.  It had so many internal inconsistencies and cliches that it infuriated me.<br />I was skimming by the end and even so it infuriated me.  It was so predictable and banal.  Reading it was a waste of a good afternoon.	2003-07-10

Jenny Cotton is the author/producer of My Lady's Chamber who loves her job so much she can't bear to see it as 'work' and strives to recreate a family within her work environment (a common theme explored by KGS)<br />When a new actor arrives on set,  the experienced but wary Alec Cameron, he challenges and changes the dynamics and things start to shift.<br />The clever weaving of a regency romance (the setting of the soap opera) and modern day television,  the exotic world of TV and the reality of people's complex feelings, makes for a lovely novel.  KGS writes beautifully as always,  and I don't know why she is so underrated but if you can pick this book up,  do,  it is well worth it and a definite keeper.	2003-01-27

Roderica is a great heroine,  beautiful,  witchy,  scared of her gift,  which allows her to read the minds of others.  She longs for a normal life but knows how unlikely that is if she can sense every thought of her spouse and he knows it.<br />But when she meets the Devil Earl, Faelen,  she can't read his mind and decides to marry him. He is one of the best heroes I have ever met:  haunted,  cynical,  needing love.<br />And,  in the way of the best romances,  they rescue each other.  Their relationship is so true,  and their love so clear.  It really is a joy to visit with it.<br />A definite keeper.  If you see it,  buy it!	2002-12-30

There were chuckle out loud moments and steamy sensuality (all puns intended,  the love scene in the new fangled splash bath worked very well.)<br />My only quibble was that it ended rather quickly,  I could have had a few more pages exploring Greece,  and that I hope we meet these characters again,  because some of them certainly deserve more love than they were getting!<br />It reads well and easily,  this is my first Eloisa James but certainly not my last.	2002-12-21

It has an interesting,  unusual heroine in Anne, and a sense of real emotional connection between her and Jack.  You read this book and you care for the characters,  you want them to get together and when it ends you hope you will meet them again some day.<br /><br />It is something about redemption and what is real love and what makes us want to live or die... more depth than average and certainly not a light confection,  but worth spending time with.

It is also not a light and frothy read.  It is is an unusually strong, quite dark,  very passionate roller coaster ride.<br /><br />Its strength is not is plotting - which has a nice unique twist - but its characterisation. I have read many, many romances,  and not found two lovers like these. They are people with crippling pasts,  of abuse and genuine regret,  who meet each other,  and somehow,  find it in themselves to trust once more.  The romance feels genuine and compelling.  There is humour,  grit and grace here,  and I felt touched by a genuine sense of love and the possiblity of miracles.<br /><br />A definite keeper.<br /><br />Edited to add that I just reread it again in Nov 2009 and still love it.  It hasn't dated,  and the characters search for redemption really is moving.  I really enjoyed spending time with them.	2001-03-27

There was some banter between them,  but not enough to sparkle. The subplots were contrived and the so call secrets very easily discerned.<br />This is not a book I would recommend,  there are far better regency style (it's set in victorian times but has a regency feel to it) romances out there.	2001-02-27

She gives us a complex,  intriguing hero in David de Abyndon and a glimpse of commerical London that we don't often see - because David is not the stuff of songs,  he is not a knight in shining armour - rather he is a realistic merchant,  who finds himself betrothed to the highborn Christianna at King Edward's behest.<br />Christianna is a fairly traditional heroine - young, 18,  almost virginal, but she has some depth and common sense and while I feel that this is definitely David's book,  she never jars.<br />The book feels like a fresh approach - a real achievment in the crowded medieval romance scene! - and I am looking forward to reading more of Hunter's works.  It still lingers in my mind and it was a difficult world to leave - a definite keeper.	2001-02-23

Try reading it years ago,  packing it up in a box,  stumbling across it unexpectedly years later,  and recalling the haunting beauty of it immediately.<br />Doomsday is not a standard novel.  It does not fit into a standard genre,  but it does tell a marvellous story that is moving,  thought provoking, and ultimately truly memorable.  The medieval people are particularly good - I agree with the reviewer who said that for once these were not 20th century people in fancy dress,  but you really got a glimpse of how humans from a different time may have thought. What imagination and what a gift it is to read it!<br />Not only is this a wonderful book,  it improves on rereading.  for a few dollars and you get a new way of looking at the world - what more could you ask for...<br />read and enjoy,<br />amf	2001-01-09

This is the first one I found.<br />There was a lot to admire in this book - firstly,  far from the virginal unknowing heroine,  Adriana St Ives actually has sexual needs,  which she once met.  Sadly,  because of the times in which she lived,  this lead to her ruin.  Her brothers felt honour bound to defend her,  and then had to leave the country. And that is all in the back story!!  So the scene is richly set.<br />Adriana is a complicated delightful heroine, and her final speach was quite wonderful:  &quot;I learned to fight like a boy, and my heart was too lusty... I am ashamed of my willfulness in taking a lover,  and I am even more ashamed that I did not insist upond dueling Malvern myself.  If I wanted to play the man on one level,  then I needed to be a man on all levels..&quot;  An inspirational heroine!<br />However I have to agree with the reviewer who said that the hero's past was not as well drawn. We never know why he was called the Black Angel and indeed his London exploits which brought him the name are never illuminated.  His difficulties and painfilled past are more Irish in origin - but then,  why not call the book A Hundred Kisses (a plot device to get the sexual tension up) and leave the angel references out altogether...<br />Also,  it was clear on one level that the book is setting up a series - so we will experience the love stories of Adriana's siblings.  However in this book it left for a lot of loose threads.  Matters of import were alluded to and never followed up. Sisters had important discussions and then seemed to forget about each other.  One moment a sister's illness is so threatening that they all have to leave London at a pivotal moment to visit her,  and then they just seem to forget about her.<br />I actually found it a strength that the romance included such diverse themes as racism, religion and feminism.  I feel that it grounded the book,  giving it a sense of reality and aliveness.  And Ms Samuel's does write beautifully. However I was left with the sad feeling that it could have been so much better...gion and feminism.  I feel that it grounded the book,  giving it a sense of reality and aliveness.

I really like Suzanne Brockman, she has a consistent energy and a complexity to her characters. Kiss and Tell feels like an early book of hers, it's quite heavy handed, and I have to say I was disappointed.<br />There was little romantic tension, not much of her trademark humour or energy. Her hero is Dr Marshall Devlin, who kisses his best friend's sister, Leila Hunt, whilst dressed as a ninja. There are fireworks, but to his surprise, she doesn't realise it was him. So instead of telling her it was him, well there wouldn't be a book if he did that, we go through 100 or so pages before she figures it out. There are some funny lines and situations, but the book never came alive for me.<br />All serial romances are by definition contrived, but many wear their plots more gracefully than Kiss and Tell does. I would still buy a Brockman on name alone, but if you don't need this to complete your collection, I would let Kiss and Tell go.	2000-11-12

So full points for marketing - the cover,  the synopsis,  they work well.<br />However the story was really,  well,  un-romantic for starters.  I didn't warm to either Nick or Daisy,  didn't really care what happened to them and didn't fall in love with anyone in the book.

I liked him a lot and could relate to his perfectionism and his pain.  However the heroine,  Jen Varga seemed less well drawn.  I found her a bit irritating if truth be told (and as this is a review,  where better to tell the truth!) She seemed to get into serious situations without giving it due thought - her marriage,  her career,  her current trials in the book,  were all approached in a slap dash manner and she seemed  younger than her years.  While Mike had suffered and grown,  she seemed to be stuck in a petty rebellious mode.<br />Having said all that it was an interesting read,  and I was happy to have it,  but I won't keep it.<br />Hope this helps you,<br />amf	2000-09-24

This one is my very favourite of hers.  It  is quite complicated plot wise,  and benefits from more than one reading,  but it has a great love affair with genuine tension and complexity in it.<br />Cherish is a thoroughly believable heroine,  who is traumatised by her  involvement in a tragic airplane crash a year ago. She has family and  friends (I always hate it when the heroine mysteriously has neither!) and a  decent career,  but a miserable private life. Alex who professed to love  her,  has disappeared.  And Conor,  who is a most delicious hero,  seems to  have betrayed her.<br />The secondary characters are also well fleshed and  interesting.  Conor's sister, Geena,  eventually reveals that the reason  she is so furious with Cherish is because she feels that Cherish never  fought sufficiently for her brother.  It's an interesting exploration of  what love and trust and faith mean within a relationship.<br />Having said  that, it is also a fast moving, taut thriller,  with loads more science  than I understood,  and a good ending.  You were sad to let the lovers go,  and wanted to spend more time with them - always the sign of a keeper.  The  reason it's only 4 stars is that it is a bit plot heavy on first reading.  If you are looking for some mindless fluff,  this is not for you,  but if  you want something to get your teeth into,  romantically speaking,  then  snap it fast!	2000-09-09

I know that there are 21 other reviews and I am not going to say anything  unique but I have loved this series for so long,  I just want to put it in  writing.<br /><br />Sometimes you are just loping along in your own life and  something wonderful happens - you fall in love,  get your dream job,  fall  pregnant (if you want to be!)  and for a while the world is a shing place  where everything is glowing and bright.  Sooner or later the shine dims,  but the memory, of how happy you were,  how special it was,  that  stays.<br /><br />So here you are, loping along, wondering what book to buy next,  and here it is,  a shining experience waiting for you...  This is the start  of a magical series (ignore the awful cover drawing show here! It doesn't  reflect the books at all)<br /><br />I reread these books on average once every  two years,  so all the characters are now old and familiar friends.  They  are complex, with foibles and mistakes,  with heroism and madness,  with  granduer and evil.  There are dreamers and victims,  great imagination and  a sense of an entire universe out there.<br /><br />It isn't even strictly  speaking science fantasy.  It's set on earth, and everything is (sort of)  feasible.  It's an epic tale,  one to sink your teeth into.  It will fill  your days and invade your dreams.  Enough already - go out and buy  it!!<br /><br />:-)<br /><br />Edited to add that I reread this again recently (in 2009) and while it is a little dated in some of it's approaches,  it's still and an excellent series and well worth tracking down.	2000-09-05

This book is a classic.  It was written in 1971, and unlike many texts of that time, it is still  fresh,  interesting and relevant.  It's written in an easy,  jargon free  language, which has at its heart a depth and genuine empathic concern for  people and their journies.<br />The techniques they apply are based on the  transactional analysis model developed by Eric Berne,  but don't worry,  you don't have to know any thing about that - the book explains itself  beautifully.<br />The main reason I love it is that it is filled with  exercises that you can do by yourself,  or share with a partner,  about who  you are and how you relate to things. It has excellent, simple exercises  that open you up to examining childhood influnces, parental attitudes and  current behaviour patterns in an illuminating,  non-judgemental way.<br />If  you are interested in learning a bit more about yourself,  or if you have  behaviour patterns that are troubling you and aren't sure where they come  from,  this is a great place to start.<br />I've given this book frequently as  a gift (adolescents love it!) and I always get lovely feedback.  I would  definitely recommend this book ahead of a host of others that are out  there.	2000-09-04

There are plenty of her books that are keepers.  Sadly this is not one of them.  I'm reviewing it in case you're chasing it through the auctions and  want some plot details...<br />It's heroine, Calla, is a journalist with a  complicated history with men. She feels her father betrayed her by refusing  to marry her mother,  and her adult relations with men havn't been much  better.<br />We meet her when she is about 28,  and has a son,  Jonothan,  whom she adores.  She stumbles across the hero,  Josh,  while covering an  accident at his circus. He is quite a delicious hero,  full of animal  magnitism,  and there is a lot of sexual tension,  but the plot didn't  quite work.<br />One of the underlying themes of the book is Calla's hatred of  animal abuse,  and her sense that circuses degrade and abuse animals.  Her  stance is so strong that she has never taken her son to the zoo...  She  clashes with Josh over animal rights, and he makes some puns about  releasing the animal within...<br />In the end, she spends some time with the  circus,  falls in love with some tiger cubs,  comes to see that the animals  love performing and are leading a very happy life,  and that the animal  rights protesters are an odd bunch.<br />If this doesn't sound much like a  romance,  perhaps that is the problem.  There was an awful lot of plot that  didn't quite tie up.  Josh's acceptance of some quite remarkable news in  the last 5 pages just didn't make sense.  There should have been at least  20 pages...<br />I was left feeling dissatisfied.  It was an  interesting angle, but not properly worked out.  So I think that roughneck  is too rough around the edges and would give it a pass,  unless you  absolutely needed to complete your collection.	2000-09-01

Ms Gaffney does make his journey believable,  but it a pretty  grim one, from where he incites his so called friends to humiliate and mock  Rachel,  ..., to his entire attitude to their  relationship.<br />But what disturbed me even more was Rachel's history.  There is something quite disturbing about giving the heroine such a dark  and twisted past.  In fact all the women in the book (aside from the  lovely Anne,  the vicar's wife, whom I understand was the heroine of the  previous book) have abuse in their background.  In Ms Gaffney's world it is  almost standard to have been sadistically abused.  That just felt wrong to  me,  and that is why I won't keep this book.<br />I really didn't like the  start of the relationship between Rachel and Sebastian -...,  and even though she grew to love him,  I felt very  uneasy about it. Even though the development of their love is handled very  well,  the start of it was just too awful for me.<br />I've just written this  to warn people - strange things go on in this book.  Clearly there are  those who really loved it,  and revelled in love conquering such bitter  darkness,  but I found it a bit too twisted for my taste.	2000-08-30
US	50691753	R37X8SNORYNT84	0553576267	570329646	The Vow	Books	4	4	6	N	N	This is a keeper	I've read loads of medieval historical novels, but this one is something  special.  The hero is cunning and smart,  but the heroine is even more so!  I like to see a genuinely strong woman who never becomes weak and foolish  because she's met the man she could love.  And I like to see Luc,  the  hero,  learn that woman are not as simple or as soft as he had thought,  but this one will spice up his life as no other could.<br />I liked their  friction,  which was realisitically handled,  and then their love,  and how  two strong people become devoted to each other.	2000-08-25

I didn't realise, when I bought this book,  that it is actually a novella  - it's only about 90 pages long.  I love Crusie's work,  but this was the  first romance that she ever wrote,  and it feels it.<br />It's too short to  really get into the characters or their love affair,  and Emily's ideas on  how to make the perfume 'sizzle' sounded a bit strange to me.  She had some  good marketing lines (it's the sizzle,  not the steak that we are selling  here)  and I liked her character,  but I felt all the characters needed a  bit more time and thought.<br />It's a fun read,  but not a great one,  and  seeing that it can be hard to get and thus quite pricey,  it's not really  worth it..<br />Sorry.  Don't mean to be negative.  I love all her other  other stuff!	2000-08-23
US	50691753	R3FVWXVQLKCLTY	0373255632	224857817	Manhunting	Books	4	30	32	N	N	Worth hunting down	This was Jennifer Crusie's first published romance and it's so  sophisticated and slick and funny,  that any would be writer will go green  with envy.<br />It has all the trade mark Crusie attributes even at this early  stage - great humour,  even better energy level - it's a fun, uplifting  read.  It also has a great heroine in Kate,  who is too thin, too  successful but also too staid.  She makes you aware of the price Kate has  paid to get where she's at. And you laugh out loud at the terrible dates  she manages to get for herself on her one woman mission to 'manhunt'  herself a husband.<br />Jake is an equally great character. He is warm and  lazy and funny.  He also needs more direction in his life.<br />Both lovers  help bring out the best in each other - which is what love's all about  after all...<br />There was a quirk or two with the secondary characters  (Jake's brother is unexpectedly brutal (emotionally,  not physcially!) in  one scene)  so it's only a 4 star rating,  but it shows Crusie to be the  talent she so obviously is,  from the word go.	2000-08-23

I have read every book of hers in print and it's a  happy day when a new one comes out.<br />I bought this one when it first  came out,  and being a die hard fan, I've even re-read it.  But it is far  from her best book,  and there is a scene at the end,  just before the  hero,  Lucas,  realises how wrong he's been,  that is down right  disturbing.<br />Dee is a good heroine, in that she is tough and smart and  hardworking,  but Lucas is not as good a hero.  I think Howard's  contemporaries are better than her Westerns, and that this is her weakest  Western.<br />If you absolutely have to have it,  then buy it,  but otherwise,  try another - she's a great writer,  but this one sinks...	2000-08-23
US	50691753	R2WMAG1O0N29VO	0425121631	425740762	Rules of Prey	Books	4	10	10	N	N	A welcome entry for a new unscrupulous hero	I was lucky and bought this book when it just came out,  and have read  every one of the prey series since.<br />This is a great, easy to read  thriller written by a confident and deft writer.  But it is also a great  foundation for a series... So all the male characters have quite a bit of  depth to them.  And Lucas definitely lasts the distance.<br />If you've not  read any of the series you're in for a treat.  Admittedly the women aren't  written as well as the men,  but Lucas is such a complex character, with  his friendships and mind games,  with his willingness to set people up and  his rage when he fails to take into account all the consiquences.  Some of  the other reviews were a bit damning on this level,  but I liked it for  that very reason - Lucas is three dimensional,  and as any three  dimensional person will tell you,  there are parts that contradict each  other. Lucas has these contradictions,  but in a wholly authentic  way.<br />The women get better as you go down the series (or at least some of  them do)  and while not all the books are as good as this one,  most of  them flow with ease and energy and all are worth reading.<br />Sandford just  gets better and better as a writer and I buy him in full confidence that I  will enjoy the read.  My personal favourite is Shadow Prey, which stands on  its own,  but it helps to read the earlier ones first.<br />Hope this  helps,<br />amf	2000-08-21

If you haven't read this yet you are so lucky - you have such a treat  ahead of you.  I have to admit that science-fantasy has been disappointing  me of late.  It's too contrived or too shallow or badly written.  But this  series,  is just wonderful.<br />I read an interview with George RR Martin  who said that he wanted it to read like the War of the Roses (real history)  but with the drama of no one knowing the outcome. He wanted you to feel  that anything was possible - any  character could die at any time. And he  has written a masterpiece.  It's gripping,  and chilling and so wonderfully  thought out,  with a hundred clever ideas and great characters all of whom  have parts you love and parts you hate.  I took it to the sun,  but could  only feel the cold of the world Martin has created,  with the ominous  'Winter is coming' as it's theme.<br />This is a lush,  rich fantasy,  in a  fully realised world,  that you will love and keep forever.<br />Buy it now!  In fact,  buy the sequel at the same time,  otherwise you will have to  endure a dreadful wait in between books.	2000-08-21
US	50691753	R3P3SP2GO4C8G7	0061013889	31680314	Summer's End	Books	5	5	8	N	N	A wonderful summers escape with Summer's End	There are already 20 reviews, and I don't want to bore anyone,  but I've  loved KGS for years now.  She writes romances with depth and feeling,  and  with lovely sentences. I don't know why she remains so underrated,  and  that's why I decided to add my review to the list - to convince the  dabblers that this is a book worth investing in - I've kept all my KGS  books,  but this one,  Summer's End, is especially light drenched.  It's  got wonderful side characters,  with lots of interesting and real conflict  between sisters and coping with family pain.<br />My only criticism is that  we don't really get enough interaction between the lovers,  we could have  had a few more pages on them,  but that is a minor quibble. You meet a  whole host of characters that feel like friends and you don't want the book  to end.  Indeed I sincerely hope that she uses some of the other characters  here in a new book or three - that's how close you felt to them.	2000-08-14

For people who aren't sure if they have read this one or not, it's about Victoria (Tory) a 'failed' Miss America (third runner up) who has to figure out who she is if she's not a beauty queen. Of course she finds a wonderful man (this is a romance after all!) but she also resolves her relationship with her mother and creates new relationships with her extended family. That's why I love this author - she grounds her characters in real worlds, made beautiful by love. You really hate to finish her novels. If you come across this one, grab it, it's a keeper!<br /> ...	2000-06-29
