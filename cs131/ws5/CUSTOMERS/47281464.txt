Jeannette Walls was unfamiliar to me when I bought \\"The Glass Castle\\" but her story is one I will never forget. Her childhood rivals (even outdoes) the hardscrapple childhoods described in Augusten Burroughs' \\"Running with Scissors\\" and Jennifer Lauck's \\"Blackbird.\\" What can a child survive, and move beyond, to become a successful, functional adult? This book will give you an idea.<br /><br />More than once the reader will question Walls's parents, and the choices they make, in putting their four kids through the unconventional life they live. This is what makes \\"The Glass Castle\\" slightly different from other poverty memoirs: there is a sense that the way the parents live is a choice, not a set of circumstances they endure involuntarily. There is a suprise at the end that had me questioning the sanity of Walls's mother. And, yet, Walls is much less judgmental than her readers will be, reserving a special affection for both her parents. And given the talent that Walls displays here, there is evidence that perhaps her parents really were frustrated, but highly gifted, artists and had no choice but to live the way they did.<br /><br />Highly recommended... this is a book that will haunt you for months.	2005-08-27

Several of the authors were familiar to me before I read it, others I had never heard of. As with a lot of anthologies, I found that some stories worked better than others. All are revealing in ways that give the book a page-turning quality.<br /><br />My favorite of the group was Emily White's \\"Shelter\\" about a male-female high school friendship that goes horribly awry when the two move to New York together. The characters were vivid and fascinating; at times I had to remind myself that I wasn't reading fiction. Another standout is Nuar Alsadir's \\"Want\\". It is by far the most subjective and judgmental piece -- I would be very curious to hear the other side of that story. But it is also the piece that is best at showing rather than telling. The two sided \\"Emily/Heather\\" essay -- two friends writing both sides of the friendship -- shows just how differently people see each other, and how often people overlook their own frailities while being tough on others.<br /><br />There are other essays that aren't nearly as riveting but all serve to show the complexity and diversity in women's friendship. Although it may be difficult to glean any wisdom from these stories, it will make anyone who has ever lost a friend realize they are not alone.	2005-08-20

I have read all 3 of the QAF novels, and \\"Always Have, Always Will\\" is the best of the three. Sadly, that isn't saying much. \\"QAF\\" is, above all, a highly visual show. Absent its good looking cast, thumpa thumpa soundtrack, and witty one liners there isn't much to go on.<br /><br />However, this one works because, at last, the gang (sans Justin) is together. Melanie and Ted are introduced as college friends who meet the rest of the gang at Woody's. Melanie is soon smitten with Lindsay, and Ted with Michael, so the gang of six is formed. Various plots ensue. The best are Emmett's comical foray into the workworld and Mel and Lindz's romance. The author is good at setting the scene in Pittsburgh, although this is ironic since the show itself doesn't do a very good job of disguising Toronto (where it's filmed) for Pittsburgh.<br /><br />There are a few continuity errors. Fans of the show know that Ted has an MBA from Wharton, in Philadelphia, not the University of Pittsburgh, so he wouldn't have been around at this time. Also, Mel and Lindz are established on the show as friends who became lovers, but \\"AHAW\\" introduces them as love interests immediately upon meeting. Emmett, on the show, has said that he left Hazelhurst but only got as far as Pittsburgh. In this, we're supposed to believe he lived in LA for two years. All of this makes me wonder who is editing these books.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed \\"Always Have, Always Will.\\" I think this ends the series and that is a good thing. Unlike the show, which I could watch forever, I have grown tired of this enterprise.	2005-08-11

Having struggled through \\"A Fine Balance\\" a while back, I was somewhat skeptical when my book club chose \\"The Kite Runner.\\" I feared that overly dense prose might keep me at an arm's length from the serious subject matter. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised by \\"The Kite Runner.\\" The first chapter pulled me in and I was able to get through the book in a few days.<br /><br />In terms of theme, I was reminded a bit of Ian McEwan's \\"Atonement.\\" (Warning: mild spoilers follow.) In both books a child witnesses an atrocity (or what they take to be one) and struggles for the rest of their life with the guilt over what they did (or didn't do) about it. While Briony's attempt at redemption was to write about the events, in \\"Kite\\" Amir makes more selfless choices for his atonement. I think this is why \\"Kite\\" is a much more cathardic read than \\"Atonement.\\" Amir genuinely has to give of himself, and put himself even in harm's way, to make up for his past transgressions. Briony's attempt at atonement never really works because she hasn't given anything of herself (other than the difficulty one has writing) to achieve it.<br /><br />Hosseini writes well, almost breezily despite such heavy subject matter. I enjoyed the book, and I'm sure many others will as well. One caveat: I liked it without loving. This is the kind of book that might be spoiled for some by overhype.	2005-08-11

I am a big fan of \\"Queer As Folk\\" -- enough of a fan to buy and read a novelization like \\"Never Tear Us Apart.\\" But I'm not enough of a fan to claim these books are anything more than a rather pathetic attempt to milk fans out of their money. And, yet, it works: I have bought and read two of them, this one and \\"Every Nine Seconds.\\" And I'll probably read the third at some point too.<br /><br />Why don't these books quite work as stand alone novels? Because \\"Queer As Folk\\" is, above all, a visual show. It's about good looking people, music, and memorable performances. None of this comes through in \\"Never Tear Us Apart.\\" The plot is breezy enough to keep a fan reading, but the book lacks a single memorable line of dialogue (the show is known for its one-liners) and the plot seems like a retread of much better episodes. You will have to have a pretty strong visual imagination to conjure up what the author is trying to illustrate -- he isn't a very gifted writer.<br /><br />So, why read these at all? For two reasons. One, they provide something the show does not: a narrative about what these characters were like before the show started (this one features Brian, Mikey, Lindsay and Emmett -- who knew?-- in college). For another, they serve as additional entertainment if you're looking for something beyond the show itself. And, occasionally, they are clever. In \\"Nine Seconds\\" Brian stops in a convenience store and encounters six year old Justin, holding his teddy bear named Gus. (Fans of the show will understand why that's cute -- Justin eventually names Brian's son Gus.) In \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\" Todd, a inside joke type of character from the show, gets a back story, and we meet Lindsay's first girlfriend, who is mentioned in a memorable way in season two. The \\"background info\\" quality to these books is fun.<br /><br />If any of this sounds appealing, you might like these books. I think they are strictly for diehards.	2005-08-09

Truth, Beauty.\\" This quote, by John Keats, has puzzled many a student of English Lit. I remember a professor in my undergraduate years who had the quote permanently etched on her blackboard. In her wonderful memoir, Ann Patchett wrestles with this quote too, by way of telling the story of her devoted relationship with Lucy Grealy. Lucy has been disfigured as a result of childhood cancer and spends a lot of her life asking questions like 'Will I ever have sex again?\\" and \\"Will anyone ever love me?\\" She is convinced that she is ugly, and that this is her cross to bear. It is also her muse, and the subject of a book which makes her famous, Autobiography of a Face.<br /><br />Ann Patchett doesn't seem to think Lucy is ugly. She is devoted to her friend, accepting phone calls at all hours, letting her sit in her lap, even carrying her around when she can't walk. She is mother, confidante, companion. Their relationship plays out first at the Iowa Writers Workshop, then via letter and phone as the two criss-cross the country attending various writers' programs and communities.<br /><br />Like her wonderful novel \\"The Magician's Assistant\\", \\"Truth and Beauty\\" is about strange bonds that defy category. Are Ann and Lucy friends, sisters, nurse and patient? Readers will have to draw their own conclusions about why it is Ann is so devoted to Lucy. What does Lucy give to Ann? She is, as other reviewers have noted, an appallingly self-centered person. Most people would pull out their hair if they had to deal with her. But Ann seems to adore her. There is much to be said here about the nature of love. Ann and Lucy are much like that couple you know, of whom many say, \\"What do they see in each other?\\"<br /><br />\\"Truth and Beauty\\" is also a fascinating look at the life of a writer. I was unaware of a lot of the artist colonies and programs that Ann and Lucy attend, and loved getting a look at them. I was particularly intrigued to learn that Ann is friends with several authors I have read, including Adrian Nicole LeBlanc and Elizabeth McCracken, and that they all meet up at these places.<br /><br />This is one of the best books I've read this year.ith several authors I have read, including Adrian Nicole LeBlanc and Elizabeth McCracken, and that they all meet up at these places. <br /> <br />This is one of the best books I've read this year.	2005-06-01

I finished it in two sittings, and in the months since I read it I have found myself thinking about it still. It has the same kiss-and-tell appeal of shows like 'Sex and the City'. There are individual chapters, such as one where Juska tells about her experiences teaching writing at San Quentin, that show that Juska is a gifted writer. I admire her ability to reinvent her life and make no apologies for it.<br /><br />That said, at times I found myself getting annoyed with the author. There is unquestionably something narcissistic about her personality, and I would agree with those that found some of her behavior questionable. Her need to sexualize every relationship she has seems consistent with someone who has been abused, but she never touches on this, except for a brief mention that she was in fact abused as a girl. What is the adult Juska's perspective on this? Does she think all expressions of eroticism are appropriate, or that some of her behavior is off-kilter?<br /><br />By the end of the book, Juska reminded me of a certain type of self-absorbed person you encounter in life. People like this are highly entertaining to live vicariously through, but after a while you begin to feel like a prop in their life, an anonymous audience for their egotism.	2004-10-25

James Cone's &quot;Martin &amp; Malcolm &amp; America&quot; is a fascinating contrast of the lives, experiences, and thoughts of two icons. It is written in a style that recalls good investigative journalism as it maps out the tumultuous times in which the two lived.<br />The philosophies of Malcolm and Martin, often portrayed as polar opposites in the media, are grounded in certain similarities. Both based their viewpoints on their religious traditions, believed that God was on the side of the poor and oppressed, and both held a passionate belief in the dignity of black lives. Both philosophies were formed in spite of the fact that they lived in a age when the institutions that ruled America either neglected the dignity of blacks, or ignored civil rights issues altogether.<br />The lives of Malcolm and Martin were quite different, however. Martin was raised in a upper middle class family in Atlanta, the descendant of slaves whose father and grandfather both became prominant preachers. He life afforded him a great education -- at Morehouse, Crozer Theological Seminary, and Boston University. His family was close knit.<br />Malcolm, by contrast, saw his father murdered by white supremicists and his mother abused by the social service agencies, which eventually institutionalized her. Malcolm ended up in the foster care system and eventually went to prison for petty crime. There, he came to value the importance of education, and read voraciously. Introduced by his brother to the Nation of Islam, he had a powerful conversion experience in prison. After his release, he became second in command to Elijah Mohammed, the religion's leader.<br />Both Martin and Malcolm spent their time working to improve the quality of black lives. Martin took on institutional power through civil rights legislation, and Malcolm worked in the urban ghettos, attempting to galvanize blacks to reject Christianity and move towards strengthening their lives through non-integration. Although Martin and Malcolm differed in their visions, they were more alike than not.<br />&quot;Martin &amp; Malcolm &amp; America&quot; is a great read.

Pagels writes that, during the first four centuries of the common era, there were many different schools of thought about religion, almost as many as there are in the contemporary American setting that she writes.<br />In this book, she examines how one myth -- the story of the fall of Adam and Eve-- shaped different religious thinkers. Some, like Augustine, took it as an illustration of the inherantly sinful nature of people, and used the story to flesh out his highly influential beliefs about original sin. Other religious thinkers, like Gnostics, saw the myth as an allegory about the spirit (Eve) within the flesh (Adam) and even went so far to see the serpant as an early foreshadowing to Christ. The fall wasn't a bad thing -- it was an allegory of emerging spiritual consciousness.<br />Readers may be surprised to discover just how influential the Adam and Eve myth really was. For many under Roman rule, it was the first introduction to a notion of human equality-- all people were equal creations of God-- and a spark that lead to contemporary American concepts that &quot;all men are created equal.&quot; (Just to be accurate, in both of these periods it was only men who were seen as equal, and no consideration was given to women, slaves, etc...) Pagels points out that an idea like this, which the American founding fathers took to be 'self-evident' is in fact an empirically unprovable concept, and philosophers like Aristotle would have found it absurd.<br />Elsewhere in the book, Pagels provides an interesting window into Christian attitudes about celibacy. I was surprised to learn a life of renunciation was seen as a freedom from the responsibilities of family life -- my modern mind was more trained to see it as a purely religious concept, not a practical one.<br />Pagels has a succint, controlled writing style that is hypnotic. In just 154 pages, she covers a lot of ground. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and would be curious to see other treatments of the singular influence of certain Bible stories.ages, she covers a lot of ground.

The author reveals a lot of primary causes, from thoughtless profiteers in the food industry to the denial of the populace, who have heard what they wanted to hear, and ignored their rapidly expanding waist bands.<br />Just a few of the culprits: (1)an increase in the use of high fructose corn syrup, a cheap sweetener which helped profits but increased caloric intake; (2)the super sizing phenomenon in fast food and convenience food; (3) an overly sedentary culture (4) misinformation in the diet industry, which sold a lot of gimmick diet books and products (5)the media telling people what they wanted to hear, including that moderate exercise was as good as vigorous exercise and (6) corporations buying their way into poorly funded schools, serving teenagers a staple of junk food.<br />Crister deals with each of these points in depth, but also gets into various sociological factors that play a part in obesity, including poorly funded schools, indigent cultures, and ignorant doctors (many of whom are never educated about nutrition and aren't giving sound or realistic advice about weight loss.)<br />Although the book is thorough on the topics it covers, Critser ignores some of the more conventional theories. He doesn't touch nearly enough on genetic factors, which do play a role in weight gain, and seems to be giving a free pass to those who eat badly but don't show it. There are many with high metabolisms who are eating just as badly as the obese, and they too will have some of the health problems (like cancer and heart disease) that the book talks about.<br />Some of the book is painful to read, because the cold facts about obesity-related illness and early death are grim realities. They are essential to know, though, and this book spells it out in a well written, compelling way. The book is well researched and balanced, and one of the better books I've read on the topic of nutrition.They are essential to know, though, and this book spells it out in a well written, compelling way.

I just read and adored Tim Farrington's &quot;The Monk Downstairs.&quot; I found it very difficult to put down, and finished it a 48 hour period. Although on surface it seems to follow a common boy-meets-girl storyline, in fact it fully transcends the romance genre. In the same way falling in love for real feels better than fake movie love, this book is better than fairy tale romances because it is more real. Its realness is most evident in the fact that the book avoids throwing unnecessary plot complications at the couple, but instead lets their problems spring from the differences in their personalities and goals.<br />Spoiler alert (skip to paragraph 4 if you don't want to know what happens): 38- year old Rebecca has reached a stage where the last thing she needs is romance. She has had it twice, with her irresponsible ex-husband Rory, and most recently with her boyfriend Bob. Bob, who has learned everything he knows about life from reading self help books, is a far too impractical man to fit into Rebecca's life. Enter Michael Christopher, a man who has recently left behind his life as a contemplative monk for reasons that become clear in an ongoing correspondance between him and his former abbot. Michael no longer needs spiritual solitude in the same way Rebecca no longer needs romance; they both feel the need for something more.<br />As it turns out, what they both need is companionship and commitment. Farrington deftly gets inside the motivations and needs of both his characters, and shows just how hard it can be, even when you are in love, to make a commitment work. In the process we come to know and care about both of these characters, and their happy ending is entirely earned. The book also is a very nice exploration of spirituality in a secular world, and its power in the lives of those who don't even identify as religious.<br />&quot;The Monk Downstairs&quot; is a lovely book and great discovery. It will appeal to readers of Elizabeth Berg, Jennifer Weiner, Meg Wolitzer, and to fans of the show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.er, Meg Wolitzer, and to fans of the show &quot;Gilmore Girls&quot;.	2003-11-04

My book club read &quot;The Dancer Upstairs&quot; by Nick Shakespeare, and it was enjoyed by all. It tells a fictionalized account of the pursuit of the enigmatic leader of a Peruvian guerilla group. It vividly creates a world unnerved by the menace of political instability, and its varied effect on the citizenry. The main character, a police detective, and his wife represent this dichotomy: while the detective ardently pursues the guerilla leader, his wife is content to sell cosmetics and drive out of the way of bombed out streets.<br />Our one gripe with the book is that the plot hinges on two highly implausible coincidences. I won't give either away, but it didn't surprise me that the recent movie version did away with one of them.<br />All in all, a good read. The world is vividly depicted, the action brisk, and the resolution satisfactory. One note: if you buy the movie cover edition of the book, don't read the back copy.

I had just been complaining about the dearth of sharp, light reads when I found this book, which is both of those things, and a lot more. It is literate, smart, funny, observant, and knowing. The world it creates -- of the West Village in 1984-- is vivid and unforgettable. I love the seen-it-all narrator, B.K. Troop, and his obsession with a naive, idealistic neighbor. The entire story doesn't strike a false note. It was one of those books that I portioned out over a few nights, because I easily could have devoured it in one sitting, and been back to my old complaints about the dearth of good summer reads.<br />I passed this book by several times in book stores before buying it because of its dull beige cover -- a really bad choice, if you ask me. Also, I was surprised that there wasn't more critical praise printed in its first pages, until I discovered that this was never published as a hardback, so the critical praise will be reserved for the next printing. I hope it doesn't take that long for this book to catch on, since it has all the potential that books like Jennifer Weiner's &quot;Good in Bed&quot; do, although this is MUCH better written.

I was told that I would not be able to put down &quot;How To Be Good,&quot; and it delivered -- I set aside most of my weekend chores to find out what became of the characters. The premise, although fanciful, was intriguing, because it seeks to answer a question many of us struggle with: how do you know for sure you're a good person? Katie Carr, the novel's protagonist, is struggling with that question, and with her disappointment in her domestic life. Married for 20 years and basically miserable, she is engaging in a half-hearted affair and considering divorce when her husband goes through an uncharacteristic spiritual conversion, changing the course of their future.<br />Although the characters are stock (especially the couple's two children, who seem faceless they are so bland), the writing shines when it examines the guilt that accompanies the middle class lifestyle, and the desire to do something to assuage it. Although some of the symbolism is a bit obvious (the New Age guru who guides their spiritual change is named GoodNews), the inner conflict of the characters rings true.<br />Like his two previous novels, Hornby is taking his protagonist on a journey from sniveling immaturity to greater depth. It differs from &quot;High Fidelity&quot; and &quot;About A Boy&quot;, though, in its conclusions, which seem vague. Katie doesn't seem any happier at the end of this journey than she was to begin with; and some of the final thougths seem tacked on arbitrarily, including the silly final image, which doesn't satisfy. Maybe Katie is simply a selfish malcontent, like an older version of Will from &quot;About A Boy&quot;. Although I'm all for readers drawing their own conclusions, something felt left out of the last chapter, as if Hornby needs to live a few more years before he decides what he thinks about all of this.	2003-03-17

Barry Glassner's \\"The Culture of Fear\\" is a timely examination of the gluttonous Misinformation Age. Every day we are saturated with stories of freak accidents, diseases, and gruesome crimes, all of which are statistical anomalies. I'm reminded of the Newsweek cover that came out about ten years ago proclaiming that a woman over 35 had a better chance of being killed by a terrorist than of getting married. That article, and others like it, lead Susan Faludi to write \\"Backlash\\", a groundbreaking look at how the media and institutions in power distort information. \\"The Culture of Fear\\" is just as groundbreaking and fascinating as Faludi's book. I'm sure sociology classes across the country are reading both of them.<br />One need only look at recent news reportage to see that Glassner has a vital point to be made. The child kidnappings over the recent summer dominated headlines and sensationalized news programs. Yet, as Glassner points out, of the 64 million kids in the US (1999 statistics) only about 200 a year are kidnapped by nonfamily members. The vast majority -- still only .001 of all children -- are kidnapped in custody disputes. None of this minimizes the pain of the families involved, but why do these stories tie up the news for months on end?<br />Consider the following contrast: on the day that Elizabeth Smart was kidnapped from her home, 30,000 children in the Third World died because they lacked the items of necessity that most US kids take for granted. Where is the coverage on this? Where is the outrage?<br />Glassner seems to believe that it is precisely the staggering state of crisis we live in that has lead to trivial and sensationalized news. The real ills of society -- corporate malfeasance, massive job insecurity, abusive families, addiction, imbalances of power both at home and abroad -- are simply too overwealming for an emotionally taxed culture to handle. Just as we grab for junk food because it's easier than preparing something better for us, we grab for junk news.<br />And, just as junk food is bad for us in the long run, so, says Glassner, is the state of the news. Our collective fears over the crime rates have lead to tougher penalties and more prisons, including tough sentences for comparitively minor crimes. The prevelence of guns, along with irrational fears about the likelihood of finding ourselves in peril, have made us the First World nation with the highest rates of handgun death, both homicide and suicide. And meanwhile, real outrages like the Enron scandal barely rate a mention in the voting booths. By feeding our irrational fears, we are ignoring the real problems that plague us.<br />\\"The Culture of Fear\\" is a fascinating and important book.

And meanwhile, real outrages like the Enron scandal barely rate a mention in the voting booths. By feeding our irrational fears, we are ignoring the real problems that plague us.<br />\\"The Culture of Fear\\" is a fascinating and important book. It would be an excellent choice for book clubs and high school ethics classes.	2002-12-15

If you want to improve your skills of debate, or familiarize yourself with Aristotlian rules of rhetoric, this is the book for you. I read it and enjoyed it, although much of it was familiar and a bit obvious. I think even an observant viewer of Sunday morning political shows will be familar with the techniques covered -- inventions, conjectures, definitions, as well as the age old structures of syllogisms and enthymemes. If you are already familiar with such things, no need to read this book.	2002-12-15

Coetzee's \\"Disgrace\\" is a fascinating examination of sexual politics and gender roles in comtemporary South Africa, a novel that is both an easy read and an exercise in complex, multi layered narratives. Although much has been made of its story being about the class structure in South Africa, it is just as much about one man's depressingly misguided life.<br />David Lurie teaches Romantic Poetry and Prose at a Cape Town univerity, and seems to consider himself worthy of the heroic outlook and life of his hero, Lord Byron. The reader knows that Lurie is a decidedly second class version of his hero, since he seems to lack the sensitivity and aethetics of a poet, and his worldview is without refreshing insights. He is a misogynist, seeing women strictly in terms of what they offer to him. This leads to disaster when Lurie engages in an affair with an impressionable coed, which leads to his dismissal from the university. Lurie heads to a provincal farm co-op, run by his lesbian daughter. Here the novel veers into an examination of class conflict in South Africa. Lurie's daughter faces a life altering tragedy, and David is at loose ends to help her.<br />Lurie's daughter, Lucy, faces the tragedy that befalls her with bewildering stoicism and passivity. This is the novel's most debatable character -- what are her motives for acting the way she does? Is she a victim, consumed with white guilt, or so without direction that she is willing to do what she decides for herself? Or, like the rest of the characters, is she a symbol of one of the forces at work in this kind of racist,hierarchical structure? Hard to say for sure.<br />\\"Disgrace\\" is a terrific effort; well worth the read.	2002-12-07

Karen Armstrong's &quot;In the Beginning&quot; came to me at the tail end of a two year study of Christianity. I looked at its dustjacket (a reproduction of Adam from the Sistine Chapel) with indifference, and decided to read it only because it was brief. To say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. For one thing, Armstrong is a lyrical writer -- as a copyeditor, I truly marveled at her sentences for both their clarity and poetry. For another, in this book she does something many clerics and scholars have failed to do: successfully apply meaning to the garbled message of Genesis.<br />She states her case pretty early on: there is no way to get a coherant understanding of God from reading Genesis. He is utterly contradictory -- creative and all-powerful in one story; vengeful and capricious in the next. This paradox has befuddled many of reader. I, for one, had come to think of Genesis as typical of the flawed meaninglessness of the Bible. But Armstrong has me reconsidering my conclusion. It seems clear, she says, that all the characters in Genesis have to endure afflictions and unfairness. Whether they are favored in God's eyes or not, their lives are difficult. A relationship with God doesn't spare them difficulties -- instead the meaning in their lives is derived in part by making it through their difficulties with their faith intact.<br />I really enjoyed this book. Just when I had grown tired of a subject, a new author has revived familiar terrain with a fresh perspective. I look forward to reading Armstrong's other books.	2002-11-25

Elaine Pagels is a first-rate religious historian-- currently a professor at Princeton-- and \\"The Gnostic Gospels\\" is her best known work, examining the contents of \\"secret\\" gospels written after the death of Jesus which were rejected from canonization and therefore are largely unknown to Bible-reading Christians.<br />What is most interesting to consider is just how different Christianity might be today if additional writings had been included in the Bible. One theory as to why they weren't was that early bishops wanted only gospels written by Jesus's apostles included in the Bible, although subsequent scholarship has proven that none of the Gospels' authorship is certain. Among the rejected, the Gospel of Thomas is probably the best known, and it is fascinating in its non-literal approach to Christ. Jesus is described as telling his followers that the Kingdom of God is not a realm (Pagels concludes that it is closer to an altered state of consciousness) and makes comments that place him closer in philosophy to the Buddha than to St. Paul.<br />A lot is covered in just 180 pages -- Pagels gets credit for being among the least self-indulgent writers around. She lays down the facts and then lets the reader mull over them. No matter what your beliefs, you will benefit from reading this book.	2002-11-24

Like many spiritual ideals, the advice is easy to grasp, harder to follow. Can a pleasure addicted society learn to embrace the pain that is inevitable in life, and connect with the pain of others? Would we want to? I'm not sure, but her advice is worth considering.<br />The chapters begin with a excerpt of the central idea of that passage, then a further exposition follows. If you are new to Buddhism, some of the terms will be unfamiliar, but not difficult to understand. I am somewhat new to Buddhism, but many of the ideas have a familar ring to them. The meditation practice of tonglen, for instance, is reminicent of the Christian concept of turning the other cheek.<br />I'm not sure if I'll read Chodron's other books, but this one was worth the time.	2002-11-21

Although it is more technical than a lot of self help, it can be used by a general audience.<br />Gilbert examines the theory of Murray Bowen, who countered notions of individual psychology (like those of Freud) with the theory that personality develops as a result of a family unit. The nuclear family, like a herd of amimals, reacts against each other, speaking a common language that is known only to them. Children raised in that family then detach from the family to form their own adult relationships, where dynamics may follow the family system.<br />In order to heal adult problems, the author offers some practical advice, like taking the time to observe old patterns as they crop up (family Christmas fights come to mind) with the dispassionate mind of an observer. The author states that individuals will better be able to understand family dynamics and their role in them by doing this.<br />I've read this book twice, and it has helped me better understand my family, and my role within it. I would recommend it for those who are seeking to better understand their family of origin, and what they can do to improve their present life through understanding the past.	2002-11-09

Damn, if Tom Robbins' &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot; isn't one of the most original, beautifully written books I've ever discovered! It is a novel that manages to be classical, comical, and comtemporary at the same time. To say that the plot involves a century-hoping effort to bottle and market the spirit of youth is like saying &quot;Being John Malcovich&quot; is the story of an actor's life.<br />Part of what makes this book irresistable is its clever and lyrical language. Robbins describes a character getting out of a spring this way: &quot;when he surfaced, spewing and sputtering, dead leaves and the addresses of a dozen hibernating frogs strewn throughout his beard...&quot;. He describes one character's internal experience this way: &quot;... inside her swelling head... a music was rising, a happiness was rising; her dumpy old heart was rising, made buoyant and girlish again, a lost beach ball blown miles across a levee, illuminated by heat lightening.&quot;<br />The book is amazing, really. I'm not sure I've ever seen a more unusual plot handled so deftly, or read a book with as full a canvas of unusual characters and locations. Most of all, the language will keep you hooked from sentence to sentence. There could be no plot at all and you would still keep reading.	2002-11-03

The country is in desperate need of the benefactor's money, and have flown in his favorite soprano from the States to perform. Shortly after her performance, the house is under siege from peasant guerrillas, who have a list of demands. What follows is a depiction of how the hostage situation leads people to reexamine their lives; strange liasions ensue, and the soprano's music is one of the few unifying forces among the disparate people involved.<br />Patchett is a wonderful writer -- she handles a broad canvass of characters with grace, her language is lovely, and the story is compelling. I really enjoyed this book and look forward to her other books.	2002-10-30

Lewis's \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is one of the best books I've found to address the considerable question of how a good God could allow bad things to happen. I found it to be as challenging and interesting as Harold Kushner's \\"When Bad Things Happen to Good People\\" although the two theologians come to different conclusions about what the reason for pain is.<br />Part of what makes Lewis amazing is the crystal clear language and metaphor he uses for examing faith. In \\"Pain\\" he talks about humanity as being an opportunity to \\"reverse the fall of Adam\\" by coming to Christ. Here, in one sentence, he has truncated the scope of the Bible down to one goal -- start with the Fall, end with the Resurrection. A perfect, crystalline comment -- one of many in this book. Then Lewis is on to the consirable task of explaining why God would require pain (in fact, death) for his creations.<br />Lewis -- in another excellent metaphor-- likens God to a sculptor and man to his clay. God is an artist, and won't stop until his creation is perfect. The pain we feel in life are God's attempt to make us his perfect creation, to complete the goal he has for our lives. In another collection, Lewis likens God to a heart surgeon. Knowing the full process required, the surgeon can't stop the process when the patient cries out in pain, because if he did the required outcome would never result.<br />Lewis likens Christians to a child drawing a circle -- they are attempting to draw something but it is rudimentary and sketchy, while the perfect circle God wants for people's lives is outside the reach without pain.<br />Fine, you might say, but what about needless suffering? Not the pain of death but the pain of life -- suffering children, poverty, abuse. Lewis is a little less convincing on this topic, relying on the age old excuse of blaming free will and man's sinful nature for the unneccessary pain in the world. Here I like Harold Kushner's metaphor (co-opted from another source) that human beings are \\"God's language\\". When you ask \\"where is God?\\" the answer is that God is in the spirit of inspiration of people who help out in times of crisis. God can't intervene, Kushner says, so he inspires people to do his work for him.<br />All in all, \\"The Problem of Pain\\" is an excellent book, well worth the read.ngs are \\"God's language\\".

Richard Elliot Friedman's \\"Who Wrote the Bible?\\" is a fascinating, page-turing account that offers a satisfying answer to the question of who wrote the The Five Books of Moses. For years, Friedman writes, it was believed that Moses had authored the first five books of the Bible. This theory had difficulty enduring due to several factors, including the fact that the books had many contradictions in language and story. Then there was the not insignificant fact that Moses had written of his own death (explained by theologians as a prophetic vision of the future).<br />It is interesting to note that church leaders had no problem accepting that the Four Gospels had different authors, but yet were resistant to the alternative theory about the Pentatuch's authorship. Friedman answers this contradiction by the rather obvious explanation that the Church was reluctant to have any changes or alterations made to their existing theory. Since the Moses myth had endured for hundreds of years, they were reluctant to part with it.<br />Friedman starts the book with a succinct, and fascinating, account of the history of Semitic people in the Middle East between the years 1200-722 BC. He then begins to offer proof about who actually wrote the Five Books of Moses.  He takes the reader through a fascinating breakdown of the language contradictions in certain part of the Bible, and supplies support for these contradictions by pointing to four different source materials that were used to make up the OT. With this theory in place (helped by an excellent index identifier for which sources supplied which story, or part of a story) he ably makes the case for the Documentary Theory of authorship. The Five Books of Moses are made up of parts of four different manuscripts, written by different sources, and pieced together by a later editor.<br />\\"Who Wrote the Bible?\\" is fasinating -- intelligent, well written, and, above all, well supported by logic and source materials.	2002-10-29

Not since I saw \\"The Sixth Sense\\" a few years ago has the solution of a mystery so satisfied me as P.D. James's \\"Original Sin\\". It is one of those resolutions that makes you close the book with a satisfied snap, wondering and admiring a style that can lead you to so obvious a conclusion without giving it away too soon.<br />Themes of sin and justice weave in and out of the plot of this mystery, which is set at a London publishing house. The publisher has been murdered, gassed to death by a fireplace accident, with a stuffed snake wrapped around his neck. Suspicion centers around the publisher's various employees and a disgruntled midlist author whose contract has been cancelled. The publisher's death comes close on the heels on on on-site suicide of a longtime employee of the firm. By the novel's end, several more corpses make an appearance, maybe one more than is necessary.<br />Then there's the solution. I won't say anything about it except that it has been perfectly set up, and yet somehow the conclusion is just outside the grasp of the reader's mind, giving you one of those \\"Of course!\\" reactions.<br />Well worth the read...

At times I felt like I was reading a page-turner, which is a feat even before you consider that this dictionary-sized book is over 700 pages long. Even given its heft, I read the book in a week.<br />The subject is hard to beat. From its origins (as detailed in Acts) as a startup cult, to its history altering co-option by the Roman emperor Constantine (there's no way of knowing how limited the scope of Christianity might be today if it hadn't been sanctioned as Rome's state religion) Christianity has been a force as influential as it has been destructive. \\"The Faith\\" covers it all -- from the papal decadence that lead to Luther's reform, to the devastating effects of the Inquisition, to the centuries old conflict between Islamic and Christian warriors. The book's chapters are more or less chronological (although there is some doublebacking) and only a few of them are less than fascinating.<br />This is as good a book as any if you want to learn about the history of Christianity. \\"The Faith\\" is really a history of what belief in a particular God has done to people -- the passions that lead to philosophic partings of the ways, the corruption of institutions, the neverending different interpretations of biblical texts. What can we learn from 2000 years of a particular religion? And how can this knowledge change the way Christians worship, and live their faith, today?	2002-10-22

Like Natalie Goldberg and Jack Kornfield, Boorstein writes about her own journey to Buddhism, and has many anecdotes about how it has made her perspective more peaceful and loving.

Maxx Barry's \\"Syrup\\" is a zippy satire written in the rapid fire style that is an attention deficit's dream -- those not compelled to read until all hours by the breezy style and frequent dialogue (not to mention chapters interupted by marketing concepts, like a printed page version of ticker tape news)will be compelled by its irresistable concept. Scat, the lead character, invents a million dollar concept, sells it to Coke, and then has his idea stolen out from under him. He spends the rest of the novel going to Sisyphean lengths to right the wrongs that plague him.<br />With characters named 6 and @, Barry gets the economy of phrasing award. Scat bears more than a passing resemblance to Holden Caulfield. Phonies abound in our hero's Los Angeles, including a patent-stealing roommate and faux lesbian love interest. This is a book where everyone has a fake resume, and even the narrator may be jerking our chain. You can't entirely root for characters this spiritually adrift, but you can wish them their own brand of happiness. A brand, no doubt, soon to be bought and sold by the Coke corporation.	2002-09-30

Few authors writing today offer the kind of comfort that Harold Kushner does. In all of his books, including his latest &quot;Living a Life that Matters,&quot; he deals with the big issues in life, and does it in a simple writing style that manages to be both profound and soothing.<br />Like his readers, Kushner lives in a dual world: a world of commerce and competition, and a world where he desires to be a good person, and feels guilt when he isn't. How does a person integrate these two worlds? As in his other books, Kushner draws on biblical stories that illustrate the universal and timeless nature of this conflict. In Genesis, Jacob is a character at first wily and ambitious (he steals his brother's birthright, among other things) but also a character who has the famous wrestle with an angel. Kushner sees this image as being a perfect symbol of man's struggle with his dual nature.  Throughout the book he returns to his struggle of duality, which he believes is inherant to human nature. We all desire to be good, while needing our competitive side to survive in this world. Kushner encourages that balance between the two is key to living a life that matters.<br />With that resolved, Kushner delves into why life has meaning in spite of our nature. He believes, as do many religious people, that every life has value to God, and even the smallest decisions we make can affect others' lives for the good. There is a nice sentiment to his spirituality, and he is gifted at handling broad topics with grace --he references sources as diverse as the Old Testement, the movie &quot;Witness,&quot; and the Jeckyll and Hyde story to illustrate his points, and does it without seeming heavy handed or moralizing. Somehow religion makes sense when Kushner explains it -- even something as baffling as eating kosher makes perfect sense when he is done explaining it.<br />I've enjoyed all of Rabbi Kushner's books. This one is on par with the rest -- graceful, moving and impactful.	2002-09-22

Lewis's \\"A Grief Observed\\" is a brief book -- only about 70 pages-- but it contains some of the best metaphors for faith I have ever read. Like his challenging work \\"The Problem of Pain,\\" this book is unsparing in its belief that a good God can will awful things on people. Like death, for instance. Why would an all-powerful God allow people to suffer and die, especially those well before their prime? Lewis went through this questioning himself when his wife died, and his journal of questions and answers fill the pages of this book.<br />How can God remain silent when the ill cry out in pain? Lewis compares God to a surgeon performing open heart surgery. The doctor, knowing best the full process required, can't relieve pain at every cry, or he would never complete the process, and the intended purpose of the pain would never come to fruition. This is a pretty unsparing description -- I wonder how many people in grief feel comfort reading such things. This is where faith comes in -- if you believe that the end result of pain and death is resurrection, and you trust in God's plan, you can find comfort knowing that every death is part of the plan.<br />Not an easy concept to grapple with -- I'm glad I read this book, but I can't help but flinch a bit at Lewis's viewpoint. It is lucid, poetic, and erudite -- and yet I still find myself uncomfortable with a God who would bring suffering on innocent people.	2002-09-10

I read a chapter a day, which I recommend to people new to Buddhism because it allowed the information to sink in.<br />Some information --like sections on karma, chakras, and lovingkindness meditation-- will be familiar to a general audience (it's interesting how many of these concepts have permeated the New Age and mainstream culture, e.g. Gary Zukav's &quot;Seat of the Soul&quot;--- read by Oprah's audience-- covers the same karma concepts.) Other parts -- like a section on mind altered states-- may surprise some.<br />It doesn't surprise me that Buddhism has become popular in the States, particularly in the Western States... it is a de-institutionalized religion with a practical approach to problem solving. Its emphasis on individual power and responsibility aligns with the rugged individualism that informs much of the American character.<br />A gracefully written book, well worth a look.	2002-08-16

At its most basic, Lynn Tillman's &quot;Bookstore: The Life and Times of Jeanette Watson&quot; is an oral history of the life cycle of one independent bookstore, in this case Books and Co. in New York. Spanning the mid-'70s to late '90s, the book is a collection of reminscences by booksellers, writers, and patrons of the bookstore intercut with the &quot;memoir&quot; of the store's owner, Jeannette Watson. (In a strange twist, the memoir is written by author Lynn Tillman from interviews held with Ms. Watson, which is a little jarring. Maybe Ms. Watson had an aversion to taking credit for a ghost writer.)<br />The book chronicles years that marked a decline in independent bookstores around the country. It is fanciful and nostalgic -- anyone who has ever worked in either publishing or a bookstore will appreciate its accuracy and the affectionate tone. It is also full of suggestions for lesser known literary reads; a nice tear out list of 50 of the store's lesser known finds is found at the book's end.<br />I enjoyed the book without loving it.

What is most impressive about \\"Fast Food Nation\\" is that it manages to be the ultimate light read about the most serious and multi-layered of topics: the history and globalization of the fast food industry. In a rapid fire, page-turning style that makes this 288 page book at times feel like a magazine article, Schlosser paradoxically leaves no stone unturned, creating a book that is social history, health primer, and political manifesto.<br />Detailing the metamorphosis of Southern California drive-in hamburger joints from family run businesses into franchised fast food companies that sprawl all over the world today, Schlosser starts the book with a fun-feeling history of the industry. The creators of this phenomenon were Horatio Alger success stories; their pluckish ideals clash horrifyingly with abuses suffered by current employees, one of many contrasts Schlosser is adept at drawing. There is a sense that this business trend took off without enough proper supervision, a kind of wildfire sprawl that can't be contained.<br />Schlosser devotes time to the dangerous work conditions of fast food (in 1998, more fast food employees died on the job than police officers), the substandard pay, the inhumanity that passes as management. From there he gets into the food itself -- the slaughterhouses, the additives, the increasing number of food related diseases. He is not entirely one sided: one chapter, on the last days of a rancher, portrays cattlemen as the disenfranchised victims of the meatpackers' monopoly. Not exactly what you would expect from the otherwise pro-vegetarian slant.<br />The book is fascinating and uncomprimising; Schlosser claims in his last paragragh that he hopes fast food will one day be seen as a relic of the 20th Century, soon to be replaced by a more health-focused culture. Anything's possible... maybe fast food will one day go the way of the cigarette, demonized into secondary status as a guilty pleasure. If it is, this book-- and the public's interest in it-- may be the starting point of that downfall.terest in it-- may be the starting point of that downfall.	2002-08-10

That wasn't the selling point for me -- I had read good reviews that this was the memoir of a boy raised in a non-traditional home in the 1940s and that detail fascinated me.<br />This is a crisply written, completely fascinating account of William Murray's gypsy childhood in the literary circles of New York, Fire Island and Rome. It is a story of becoming a man, of weathering stormy relations with parents, and about his own struggles to make a life for himself as a writer.<br />There are two generations of literary lives detailed: I was fascinated to learn how much professional writers struggle even after achieving success. Janet Flanner lived in hotels across the world, constantly missing her deadlines; the author himself resorted throughout his 20s and 30s to gambling and part time jobs to scrape by. Even his first two years working as a writer for the New Yorker came and went without him getting an article published. This is the dark side of the artist's life, and one we hear too little of.<br />My only disappointment with this book -- and it's minor-- is that it is really the story of an artist's life, not the story of being the child of a lesbian. Janet Flanner's role in the author life could just as well be that of a step-father; the fact that she is a lesbian is superfluous. But, maybe that in and of itself makes a point.<br />A fascinating and well written memoir -- worth reading.	2002-08-01

Myla Goldberg's &quot;Bee Season&quot; is the story of the divurgent lives that make up a family, people connected by blood and affection, but little else. Rabbi Saul, his kleptomaniac wife Miriam, spelling bee champ Eliza and spiritual shopper Aaron live in the same house, but occupy different realms. Eliza's gift for spelling forms the basis of the novel, but is is also a novel of spiritual exploration and mysticism, secret lives, and the shame of deviance.<br />Goldberg skillfully manipulates the separate plot lines: while Saul devotes his energy to his protegee daughter, he is unaware that is wife has been lying to him for years-- spending her days not at a lawfirm but breaking into suburban houses-- and that his son has gotten involved in a Hare Krisha cult. The emotional distances between the family, and the secret lives and identities, reminded me a bit of Jane Hamilton's &quot;Disobedience&quot;.<br />Overall, a good novel by a gifted writer.	2002-07-15

William Covino's &quot;The Elements of Persuasion&quot; is a gem of a book, the equivalent of a college class you haphazardly sign up for, only to find something that clarifies your worldview.<br />Borrowing heavily form Aristotle's &quot;Rhetoric&quot;, Covino draws on a diverse variety of sources to show how ethos (the goodwill and common sense of the speaker), pathos (the frame of mind of the audience) and logos (the information presented) form the basis of persuasive argument. Once the concepts are clear, it is fascinating to apply them to various illustrations he provides: the Scopes Monkey Trial, the 1996 State of the Union address, the 1996 Super Bowl half time show.<br />Covino provides a look behind the structure of popular argument, whether in politics, pop culture, sports or literature. Using the Aristolian model, I'm not sure I'll ever watch a movie or listen to a speech in quite the same way again.<br />More than anything, this is a gracefully written page turner that disproves any preconceived idea the reader might have about dry discussions of debate and rhetoric.	2002-07-15

The titular story is perfect in every way, an examination of family, death and the horror of conditional love. Another gem is \\"The Whole Weight of Me\\" when our heroine jumps into illuminated water and tells us \\"When I opened by eyes under the surface, I felt like I was swimming in the stars.\\"<br />Yes, the character is searching for love, but she is a thinking woman's heroine -- an artist, philosopher, and wounded but tough bird waiting to take flight. In the end, it's only fair that that flight is solo.<br />A wonderful book... turned me into a Pam Houston fan.	2002-07-03
US	47281464	R2TGZ186CXYT7U	1573228737	595147475	Affinity	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Highly recommended	\\"Affinity\\" is a wonderfully atmospheric novel, set amongst the dank prisons and fog shrouded streets of Victorian London. It is much more than that, though: it is a feminist tale with lesbian undertones, a thriller, and a supernatural shocker with a twist ending that delightfully turns on its ear endings like \\"The Sixth Sense\\" and \\"The Others\\". (I read this for a book club, and NO ONE was expecting that ending.) There is a pathos to these characters lives -- it was not easy to be a woman in such a repressive society, especially a spirited one.<br />Highly recommended... there's something for everyone in this one.	2002-07-02

Offering a specific plan for living low on the material chain, the book is chock full of helpful suggestions.<br />I read the book quickly, and followed some of the outlined plans for financial mastery. For a month I kept track of every penny I spent and found in the months since that I'm much more concious of what I spend. I have grown to have an aversion to impuslse buying, in part because the book brings home the wastefulness of materialism. I have really cut corners, and gotten rid of a lot<br />of useless clutter, and feel much better as a result.<br />Best of all, I have been able to live for almost a year on a third of what I spent when I was in a more fast track job.<br />Will this book work for anyone? I'm not sure about that, because the simple fact is, some people value possessions over free time. Some people are more than happy to work two jobs if it means being able to buy what they want, and live the lifestyle to which they are accustomed. I can't see the US being overrun with frugality anytime soon. But, for those who wish to live on less-- writers, stay at home moms, artists, or those needing to get out of debt-- this book is flawless.	2002-07-02

Wells is a competant writer, with a good sense of scene and a nice way of tying up the story (the movie, which I saw recently, didn't fare as well). I don't share the viewpoint that the women in this novel are spoiled -- in fact, I think there is a kind of pathos to their lives, and they are far from unsympathetic. I enjoyed the Catholic themes, and the emphasis on the Holy Mother (not a character who gets a lot of attention in fiction these days).<br />Overall a good read, worth a look.	2002-07-02

I have read and enjoyed all of Rabbi Kushner's books, and everytime I read a new one I'm sorry that voices like Kushner aren't the ones we hear blared through tv and radio. Why do the Jerry Falwells and Laura Schlessingers get a bigger audience than Kushner, who has a gentle and humanistic approach to spiritual matters? Is it because, as he says in this book, a life of value has nothing to do with fame or money, and knowing this, he doesn't have the desire to be a celebrity pundit? I wonder.<br />As with all of his books, \\"When All You're Ever\\" is gracefully written and brief, and thus hard to put down (I read it over a Sunday afternoon and evening.) Despite its brevity, it touches on many relevant themes, from ennui to materialism to biblical relevance in modern lives. He frames these discussions around the story of Ecclesiastes, which has always been one of my favorite books of the bible. Until I read Kushner's perspective, I didn't realize why. Unlike so many books of the bible, Ecclesiastes is written by someone who lacks purpose in life, and comes to appreciate the small pleasures. It lacks much of the fire and brimstone of other parts of the OT, and therefore has more to say to the modern reader than the more archaic (and spiritually immature) sections.<br />All of Kushner's books are wonderful. Read them!	2002-06-25
US	47281464	R1S20H610IL3PU	0140255842	290487796	Drinking the Rain: A Memoir	Books	4	29	29	N	N	Stay with it	I must confess I almost couldn't get through &quot;Drinking the Rain&quot;. Kates Shulman's account of a citified feminist's return to nature seemed an unintential parody, not helped by the comically overstated title. But midway through Ms. Shulman's story I became hooked. What seemed at first a pretentious and self-important rant transformed into a thoughtful and evocotive musing on what it is to be an artist. Ironically, it's only after Shulman returned to the city (and later goes to teach in Colorado) that the book came alive for me. Her descriptions of dinner with an old feminist friend left me teary eyed at their simple eloquence, and the descriptions of a snowy Colorado reunion with her kids kept me reading. By the end, I adored this story.	2002-04-14
