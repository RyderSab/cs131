After reading Gone With the Wind, I also read this book (and the dismal The Wind Done Gone) as a curiosity.  I'm glad I read it, mostly because I could say I did.  I also expected the worst, but in the end I believe that this book is entertaining, but not incredibly believable.    The most striking part of this book was how little Rhett was in it.  This upset me - I'd hoped that for a book on Scarlett and Rhett's reconciliation, the two characters could actually talk their problems out instead of meeting during a ridiculous bit of danger in a stone tower.  Maybe I'm too modern.  I also thought that Rhett would need more convincing to re-fall in love with Scarlett.  The idea that he was in actuality just repressing his true feelings totally misunderstands Rhett.  I also, like many, didn't buy Scarlett's transformation into a loving mother.  I did like Cat and Scarlett's relationship with Cat, but it could have been handled better.    The book was also too long - not really length-wise, but after the book got to Ireland it seemed to really, really drag.  At about page 500-600 I was begging for the book to be over.  And when the book does eventually end, everything is wrapped up too neatly.  Ashely has a new wife.  Column and Mrs. Fitz end in tragedy, and nobody really cares.  What a shame.    And yet, the book is entertaining for many long stretches.  I loved Alexandra Ripley's new characters.  Rhett's mom, the grandfather, and Scarlett's Irish family were all great fun to read about and I enjoyed learning about them.  Even still, entertaining scenes don't make for a good novel.  This book is decent, especially if you have low expectations, but I don't believe this is what \\"really\\" happened.	2005-01-03

Ever since I read about this graphic novel I wanted to own it.  While I thought the movie was decent, it paled incredibly to the wonderful Buffy show and I was anxious to see what writer Joss Whedon originally intended the show to be like.  Unfortunately, when I actually got down to reading the graphic novel I was dissappointed. <br /> <br />Whedon is an excellent writer - there are times when his clever dialogue shines through, as well as his wit (I love how Buffy eventually destroys her foes).  Unfortunately, the same can not be said of the adaptors.  The story, as well as the art, feels incredibly cramped and rushed.  I would have loved to have gotten to know characters such as Merrick and Pike, but the book seemed to be more concerned with advancing the plot rather than deepening the characters.  It feels like an adaption, and not a true story on its own. <br /> <br />I do like the book to an extent, and am glad it exists.  Still, reading this cramped graphic novel I wondered if just reading Whedon's original script would have been better. <br /> <br />P.S. Why were the vampires green?	2005-01-03

As an aspiring young writer who would love to see more books that deal with the problems teenagers face seriously, I was interested in How to Deal and the 2 books that inspired it.  Unfortunately, in both respects I was left highly dissappointed.    Someone Like You, the book that the movie followed the closest, was more substantial, but also more irritating.  Halley was fairly likable in the movie (although Mandy Moore may have had something to do with it), but I hated the book version.  She constantly makes stupid decisions like smoking and cutting class to hang out with a guy who is basically a scumbag, then whines that her mother doesn't understand her.  Hey moron, maybe your mom's just mad because you're acting like a retard.  I never felt sorry for her because she pretty much deserved everything she got.  I did like Halley and Scarlett's relationship, and I also preferred how Michael died in the book to the movie.  (A motorcycle accident instead of dropping dead in the middle of the field. It's OH SO TRAGIC!!!)  But the overdramatic ending where the whole class comes to the birth of Scarlett's baby was really stupid.    That Summer was at least more realistic.  Too bad almost nothing happened.  The movie How to Deal took the familial struggles from this book.  Haven didn't make Halley's stupid decisions, but Dessen made a mistake almost exclusively centering the book around her because she does NOTHING until the climax.  She basically gets caught up in what's around her and whines that things can't be better.  The book would have also been better if it fleshed out the characters.  I would have liked to have known more about Sumner.  Also, despite the fact that her Dad's divorce is one of the big thorns in Haven's side, he almost never appears in the book.    I'm really pretty shocked that this stuff is what teenagers read.  Pregnancy, divorce, and falling in love are all big issues for teenagers, who are already going through drastic life changes.  Unfortunately, Dessen doesn't do anything new with the complex issues.  It's the same old stuff.  What a shame, because I would really love if someone tackled these subjects in the complex way they deserved.	2004-12-07

Probably because they don't really pick.  According to Butler, who becomes a nominee comes down to four things: How much money can they raise?  Can they manage the media?  Can they win the respect of their party?  And is their campaign well organized?  If a candidate can't do these things, they are bound to lose the nomination.  Butler also explains the three way primaries work out: a \\"Seven Dwarfs\\" scenario (no obvious nominee, a \\"Snow White\\" eventually emerges because of the four aforementioned reasons), a \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" scenario (an obvious nominee against others who don't have a chance of winning), and a \\"Clash of the Titans\\" scenario (the incumbent president or vice-president vs. an incredibly strong candidate who looks like he has a fighting chance - but the incumbent always wins anyway). <br /> <br />All of this is explained clearly, with lots of details that make it both interesting and easy to follow.  At times Butler takes his metaphors a little too far, but when it comes to genuine political science, this book is top-notch.	2004-11-21

I think Day Two is my favorite: \\"If you think it's time, tell him you love him.\\"  Sheesh ... <br /> <br />Not a serious dating guide, but a good way to laugh at yourself.

One of the things I've always enjoyed about the Daily Show is how it's a satire of the news itself as well as politics.  In a similar fashion America (The Book) not only pokes fun at democracy and world politics, but also textbooks.  The interior cover even has a near-authentic stamp where you can write your name.  From there, the book contains chapters on the different aspects of government, as well as the news media, \\"future,\\" and outside world. <br /> <br />And it's funny!  Sure, it's from a liberal point of view, but it mocks the democrats as well and frankly, if you have a good sense of humor you should be able to take it.  (I enjoyed the conservative-biased Team America: World Police despite being a liberal.)  At least it's not malicious. <br /> <br />At any rate, the book is funny, particuarly for those who are fairly well-versed in politics (although it's not a requirement - but those in the know will get more jokes).  Sure, some of the humor is low-brow, but that's the point.  Nothing is sacred and the book is at the very least one laugh per page.  Even originally flipping through the book I couldn't help laughing. <br /> <br />The only minor complaint I would have is that the book works better as a coffee table book to be flipped through than a sit-down-and-read book.  The pictures and graphs are funny, but the \\"lesson\\" parts can be a bit hard to get through.  Still, the book is still incredibly funny and worth an incredibly high recommendation.	2004-11-06

The Galluccio's make their case in simple, heartfelt language.  Their love for their children and each other can be felt through their words.

Anyone who thinks politics are boring should read this book and know they don't have to be.  Tammany Hall Politician George Washington Plunkitt describes what he does in less than a hundred pages, with short essays by William L. Riordan.  Plunkitt describes the difference between an \\"honest\\" and \\"dishonest\\" graft, argues that New York City should be its own state (an argument still considered today), rages about how civil service makes people unpatriotic, and how to be successful in politics - you don't need a plan, you need VOTES. <br /> <br />Plunkitt engaged in unfair (although not illegal) practices, but this book is nevertheless fascinating if one wants to know why.  It's a great look into the political machines of the past, as well as a great explanation of why they worked for so long and how.	2004-10-23

I had to read this book for my Problems in Contemporary Journalism class and loved it.  Throughout this book, Alterman covers the history of pundits from the first essays by the founding fathers, to Walter Lippmann, to the rise of television news and ends at the Bill Clinton/Monica Lewinsky scandal.  At the end, his argument is that pundits have more influence in Washington than they do with the people, and it's up to the true journalists to knock them down. <br /> <br />The book could be an eye-opener for journalists and journalisms students.  It argues that rather than uphold objectivity, journalists themselves should put commentary into their stories.  This way there would be no need for pundits and news articles could provide for a greater understanding of an issue, rather than just shooting back the facts. <br /> <br />Sound and Fury is fascinating in its story of the history of pundits (the description of the first Gulf War sounds scarily like the second), and it provides some compelling arguments (although I don't know if they'll ever be able to work in the real world).  It's also funny in its description of some of the pundits.  (Jack Germond is \\"the pundit that Fred Mertz would have become if Ethel ever let him out of the house.\\"  Morton Kondracke is \\"the boy in the class waving his hands to answer the question only to promptly forget the answer when called upon.\\") <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book is incredibly biased.  A former pundit himself, Alterman just goes after the conservative and centrist pundits.  Perhaps there truly are more conservative pundits, but there have to be a few truly liberal ones out there.  The fact that he ignores them completely is a real down-side to this book. <br /> <br />Still, despite the bias, the book still has a lot of good things to say about journalism, the history of pundits, and the threats that pundits pose to journalism.  For that, this book is very informative, and a little funny too.	2004-10-23

In this book, the first pundit Walter Lippmann speaks about the journalism, democracy, and the American people - creating a picture that's not pretty but remains very true up until this day.  Lippmann's style may be difficult for some, but those who endeavour to read will find it fascinating. <br /> <br />Through the book, Lippmann talks about how there is no real public opinion, how most people have a very limited view of the government, and how the government synthesizes complex views into either-or issues (i.e. \\"pro-life\\" v.s. \\"pro-choice\\").  The journalists, who should help the American people understand the issue, end up doing little at all.  Lippmann offers no real solutions in this book, but for anyone who wants a wake-up call for what's wrong with the government, they should spurn Michael Moore and Ann Coulter and turn to this book.	2004-10-23

Alice Randall's original concept for \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" was for it to be a parody of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" in the style of \\"Shamela.\\"  I haven't read \\"Shamela\\" (or \\"Pamela,\\" which it is based on), but from what I have gathered, \\"Pamela\\" is a story about a virtuous woman who scorns her employer's advances, while in \\"Shamela,\\" this woman is turned into a whore who was playing her employer all along.    If Randall was trying to make a story like that, then she succeeded.  If \\"Gone with the Wind\\" was a world of strong, intelligent, good white Southerners and their stupid but kind-hearted black slaves; then \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" is a novel where those white people are shown to be morons and fools who understand little and are really controlled by those they thought they ruled (unless they're gay, like \\"Dreamy Gentleman\\" and \\"Beauty\\" - then they're nice people).  In this sense, \\"The Wind Done Gone\\" succeeds.    Unfortunately, Randall was so busy ripping down the characters of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" that she forgot to create her own.  I totally agree that Cynara/Cinnamon/Cindy is a Mary Sue.  Unfortunately, she's not a very interesting one.  She spends most of the story whining and moping about how she is so beautiful yet no one will ever accept her because she is black and she can't believe her parents betrayed her and on and on and on...  The only time she does anything is when she leaves R. and enters into an improbable menage-a-trois with a black Congressman and a black woman who reminds her of Mealy Mouth (Melanie).  By that time, I could care less.    With a boring heroine (and that's particuarly insulting, considering what a complex heroine Scarlett O'Hara was) and a story that goes nowhere, this book doesn't have much.  I didn't buy that any of the characters of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" would act as they did in this book.  The idea of Scarlett taking blame for something Cynara did, Melanie killing a slave out of anger, or Gerald having sex with Mammy is preposterous.  However, if Randall had managed to make an interesting story, I would have forgiven it.  Unfortunately, she didn't.  The only character who really benefited from any revision was Lady (Ellen O'Hara) but the revelation that she had black blood seemed to only make an unclear point.  This book is good as a curiosity, and nothing more.	2004-10-22

Scarlett O'Hara is probably one of the best female characters I've ever read in a classic novel.  She is not nice.  She is not good.  And yet, the most interesting characters rarely are.  Melanie Hamilton Wilkes and Ellen Rollibard O'Hara were wonderful women, but the point of Scarlett is she will never be that woman.  She's resourceful.  She's \\"a scoundrel.\\"  When the women of the South are thrown out of their comfortable lives Scarlett claws her way back to the top - and doesn't learn until the very end that she lost everyone for it.  Her determination is her greatest asset and her biggest tragedy.  But at the end, when she has lost everything, she decides to keep going as always. <br /> <br />On that same hand, it's a wonderful story.  The five parts are set up like a Shakespearean Play.  Margaret Mitchell, for all her faults, is a wonderful writer and her descriptions put you in the story.  She's also an intelligent enough writer to be able to write from the viewpoint of many different people, even if she mostly sticks with Scarlett's point of view. <br /> <br />But on the other hand, the descriptions of slavery are offensive.  While I believe that there were probably some benevolent plantation owners and some slaves that wanted to stay with their families (although, in the novel, it's interesting that the \\"house\\" slaves - the ones who lived with the family day by day and recieved many more privilages - are the only ones who care to stay while the field hands leave as soon as possible), slavery was indeed a horrible institution.  And the novel does seem to argue that it was all better before with slavery (although the North gets the brunt of the blame for wrecking things - even though the South are blamed for starting it).  Also, some of the heroes of the novel are Klan members, and the only criticism of their choice is that it's \\"too dangerous\\" and \\"not the way to get things done.\\" <br /> <br />As offensive as these thoughts may be to modern sensibilites, the novel still remains a great work of art.  I resisted reading this book for a long time, but now I'm glad I did.  For all its faults, I highly recommend it.	2004-09-27

I never wanted to read this book, but a friend convinced me when he learned that I loved Pip on South Park (I found the little nerd funny).  This was the best advice I'd ever taken.  Reading this not only made me love Charles Dickens, but gave me a late start on loving reading in general. <br /> <br />Granted, it's a difficult book to read.  Dickens packs his book with descriptions and long sentences (yet every word is important and helps with understanding) and he's not easy to get through.  Yet Dickens still, with all his flaws, remains a masterful storyteller.  His characters aren't deep, but they're relatable and memorable.  I love Pip, Estella, Miss Havisham, Joe, Herbert Pocket, Magwitch, and Aged P, and even though I've read this book a long time ago, I love them just as much now as I did then. <br /> <br />It's a shame that people have to read this for school (I did so for my second time).  It's a wonderful story that should be enjoyed by itself.  If you haven't been made to read it, do so now.  Push yourself through it and take your time (it took me a month to finish the book myself).  You'll be glad you did.  Assignments make you rush and over-analyze stories, and Dickens should never be read that way.	2004-09-22

David Copperfield was Dickens' personal favorite and most autobiographical book.  Long but vivid, this novel is chock-full of wonderful characters and excellent scenes.  David's story is both happy and inspiring, although this book shouldn't be taken for sap.  There's plenty of dark moments among the happy and funny.  Also, while they'll never pass Pip and Estella, I love characters like David, Agnes, Steerforth, the Micawbers, and especially Betsy Trotwood.  The book also has villians one loves to hate in Uriah Heep and the Murdstones.<br /><br />It's not as tight as Great Expectations, but in this book what is most enjoyable about Dickens is revealed.

Hard Times is a fine novel - short, often miserable (but that's the reason why this novel is so important), but with a good message.  It's also an effective satire that actually does have its moments of humor as well as pathos (such as when Stephen Blackpool dies).  I do recommend it, but as good as a book it is, it'll never be one of my favorite Dickens novels.	2004-09-22

In the novel, Fagin can be nice, but is definitley creepy and is hinted at being a pedophile and a homosexual.  So seeing him like this was a little unbelievable, but if you do accept the notion that Fagin was real and told his story to Dickens, then maybe this works. <br /> <br />And the story is compelling, particuarly the first part with Fagin growing up as a young Jewish boy.  I particuarly loved the scene where Fagin and his father celebrate Daniel Mendoza (a real Jewish wrestler)'s victory.  The middle is fine as well, but when Eisner tries to cover the last bit of the story its a bit too much of a crunch.  You just can't compress such a huge novel like that.  Also, he gets a few important facts in the story wrong.  Nevertheless, the epilogues were great.  Those who complain about coincidence need to remember that Dickens relied on that often in his books. <br /> <br />All in all, not the best or most believable graphic novel, but one that I liked a lot as a Jew and a Dickens fan.	2004-09-22

Some of his characters change chapter by chapter (Kit Nubbles can barely read in one chapter and is seen writing a letter in another) and the beginning is an absolute mess.  This novel (along with Barnaby Rudge) is started as being told by a member of a storytellers group, but then that approach is abandoned completely. <br /> <br />When Dickens eventually does find his footing, the novel gets a lot better.  His characters are wonderful as always.  Nell meets a sad end, but is one of Dickens' better protagonists (well he did prefer his daughters to his sons...).  Quilp is incredibly creepy, and the romance between Dick Swiveller and the Marchioness is incredibly sweet and fun.  Not one of Dickens better novels, but the Old Curiosity Shop still has a lot to offer.  And on the ending... I didn't cry, but I didn't exactly laugh either (guess I have a \\"heart of stone\\" if Oscar Wilde has anything to say about it).	2004-09-22

While the present tense may annoy some people, this is simply and purely a great re-telling of a classic story.  Maguire uses the conventions but strips the story of the magical elements and turns the tale into a historical drama, romance, and even a bit of a mystery.    The characters in this book are absolutely wonderful.  Heroine Iris is smart although ugly.  She has an eye for art, but somehow misses a large detail which becomes clear in the end.  Clara is beautiful but fearful of the world, yet as the story goes on she begins to possess a strong will.  Margerethe is strong, but dark, and more treacherous than she seems.  The Van de Meers are loving, but unlike the perfect parents in Cinderella, their love in some ways hurts Clara.  And then there's stupid Ruth, who is much more than she seems.    The plot is full of twists and turns and the ending completely unexpected.  Entertaining and much more accessible than Wicked, I give Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister a high recommendation.	2004-09-21

(I saw the tepid \\"Version You've Never Seen\\" of The Exorcist and hated it, but I loved this book).

Heinlein can't write women - even if they're artificial.  The treatment of the rape is insulting.

At that point I threw the novel around the room a few times and swore not to read anymore, but it was about 200 pages in, so...<br /><br />Some might say that her reaction is fine because she's written by a man (which is absolutely ridiculous, plenty of men can write women - at least better portaits than this) or not a real human.  But then why does the book INSIST INSIST INSIST that she's just like everyone else.  Then why doesn't she ACT like it?<br /><br />Some have argued that this is an adventure book but all of her doings profoundly bored me.  There were some nice speeches on racism, but a lot of people have done it a lot better.  Also, the supposedly most \\"influential\\" part of this book - the idea of America split into Balkanized states - was barely covered.  After reading it I couldn't even tell how the different parts of America were so different.  (Although the California section was somewhat amusing).  I will say that the amount of sex in this book is greatly exaggerated.  There really is very little.<br /><br />I haven't read anything else of Heinlein.  I'm open to the fact that he may be a good writer, but this book ranks as one of the worst things I've ever read.  Annoying main character, boring adventures, and a world only half-focused.  Thumbs way down.	2004-09-10
US	37834922	R3IAIV0ZH2908H	0060987103	816790174	Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Format isn't what's expected...	I think the problem with this book, for many negative reviewers, is the non-traditional format.  Instead of re-telling the Wizard of Oz or telling the story of the Wicked Witch of the West in a straightforward manner, Maguire rather uses his words to paint the world of Oz around Elphaba.  Thus, the book really does become \\"The Life and Times\\" of the Wicked Witch, rather than her deep thoughts.    Maguire originally thought he would write about exploring evil, and first thought of writing about Hitler when he decided the Wicked Witch would be a better subject to tackle.  Elphaba does evil things, but through these books we get glimpses at her heart.  Her life.  Through her interactions and conversations with other characters we get a sense of who she is, but not a full picture.  This isn't an expose, but just a small lifting of a curtain.    Thus, this book can be frustrating, but rewarding.  The story is delivered in bits - not everything is explained, but Maguire does a wonderful job of painting another writer's world in a darker shade.  But that's all it is.  Don't read this book to find out how Elphaba was really good or Glinda was really evil.  Through this book, they're revealed to be people, and it makes a good - but not great - story.	2004-09-10

I already owned the print version of the Metamorphosis and I remember reading that Kafka pleaded with the editor that Gregor-as-insect never be drawn (something that's been honored since then. The closest thing I ever saw was one book that's cover had antennae poking up from behind a bed).  So now Kuper makes a graphic novel version? It struck me as disrespectful in a way, but then again Kafka also wanted his best friend to burn his works, and his friend never did.  So why should we hold Kuper to a higher standard?<br />In the meantime, after browsing through the book (I didn't read it word for word... or buy the book.  I mean, I've read the story before and own it.) I was struck by how powerful it was.  Kuper does a wonderful job of conveying Gregor's pain and lonliness, and the flashbacks to his life before the transformation make his struggle all the more heartbreaking.<br />So all in all, it's a wonderful creation.  But I don't give it five stars because I'm still wondering if it should have been made at all.	2003-09-26

Those two things are the authors.  <br />Maggie comes across in the book as the most vanilla woman ever.  There's nothing really wrong with that, but it doesn't really work on a sex advice book.  She and the other women in the book don't seem open to anything that's really kinky, and thus I felt there wasn't anything she could tell me that I didn't already know.<br />Then there's Dan, who proved that just because you're in the minority doesn't mean you're enlightened. ...  ......Also, some of his tips seemed impossible to carry out.  (\\"The Flying Wandella\\")<br />All in all, I think I'll go to a straight man the next time I want to learn how to please one.  These guys aren't worth it.	2003-08-15

Unfortunately, the book's reviews are nothing short of insulting.  Ausin Powers 2 is a good movie for women because it assures us that guys are really good people?  What Dreams May Come is a good movie for making your guy realize how sad he'll be when you're gone (emotional blackmail, anyone?)?  Rear Window is a romantic movie?  What the heck?  And I've read their assessment of Moulin Rouge! about eighteen times and I still don't see how the movie is supposed to be sexist.<br />Also, any book that disses Jay and Silent Bob gets my goat.  And then they have the nerve to recommend Stepmom!  Yuck.<br />All in all, this book is nothing but a list horrible reviews for good and bad movies.  Don't waste your money and buy another book of recommendations.  Hopefully one that recommends Chasing Amy.<br />P.S. My issue isn't these women's opinions, it's the way they present them.  I'd rather have genuine film reviews than \\"agenda-driven\\" reviews.  That's all you're going to get here.	2003-06-03

Maybe it's because I read this while reading the abysmal \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" but I really enjoyed this book.  I absolutley loved the cast of characters.  Everyone from Kenny to Ruthie to Inez had a wonderful story to tell.  This is how novels should be...He was so cool.  Oh, and I agree with the reviewer below me.  Pablo rules.  The whore with the heart of gold but with a gay twist...	2002-07-18
US	37834922	R287KNUK4QQCFI	0671729411	173166968	Flowers in the Attic (Dollanganger)	Books	2	21	29	N	N	Not THAT bad, but still pretty abysmal...	I read this because of two things: Stephen King's insistence that this book was bad and my childhood friend's insistance that it was good.  With all due respect to my childhood friend, I'm going with Mr. King.<br />The concept of this book is actually pretty cool and there were times in this book that were genuinely exciting.  Unfortunately, V.C. Andrews couldn't pull her idea off.  Her story is bland and the characters are one-dimensional.  The grandmother is a bible-thumping stereotype.  The mother is a silly, selfish nit.  Carrie and Cory are whiny, annoying brats and Chris... well, Chris was just unbelievable.  Especially his dialogue, which was incredibly, incredibly high-flown.  I also hated Cathy.  She's a small, callow, selfish person who never changes or admits that she's wrong.<br />The opening chapter was one of the most sacchrine things I've ever read and the finale made no sense at all.  Why oh WHY did she throw away the donuts?  Forget not wanting to \\"sink to the Grandmother's/Mother's level.\\"  She killed her son!  Shouldn't she by law be obliged to send her to prison?<br />Oh well.  Two things I do want to put in perspective before I send this out: 1.) I didn't really mind the incest.  I guess growing up in the Jerry Springer generation has jaded me and 2.) Yes, there are actually mothers out there who would do things like this to their children.  It's sad, but they're out there, and I say that because in reality it's dangerous for us to turn a blind eye to that just because we want to envision mothers to be perfect.<br />Okay, I'm off my soapbox.  Anyway, skip this novel.  There's better stuff out there.	2002-07-18
US	37834922	R1S92PNP0B2XSY	0785108068	399282574	Amazing Spider-Man Vol. 1: Coming Home	Books	3	15	21	N	N	Fine.  But doesn't live up to the hype.	I read this story as it came out, but while some hail this story as excellent and the best Spidey story in years, I was rather underwhelmed.<br />First, the good things.  I did enjoy some scenes (Peter talking to the spider, the destruction of the abandoned building, etc.).  Aunt May's characterization is definitely improving under JMS.  The first Morlun/Spidey fight scene is a wonder.  And JRJR's art is simply excellent (loved the shiny effects they had on the art, too).<br />However, for the most part, I didn't feel I enjoyed this story as much as I should have.  One problem was the continuity errors.  Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn didn't go to Peter's high school, for instance.  And what was with that line where Spidey said \\"I've never fought with someone who had the same powers as mine.\\"  What about the Spider-Women?  Or Venom?  Or BEN REILLY?  All of them had similar powers.  Why did they get ignored?<br />Also, I didn't really like the school shooting scene.  While I don't mind Spider-Man tackling an issue like this, I didn't find it very realistic.  A kid sends a spray of bullets at a large crowd of kids and NONE OF THEM get hurt?  I didn't buy that.<br />Nor did I buy into Morlun's menace.  I felt that he was hyped far too much within the story.  \\"The first villian to ever tick [Spider-Man] off?\\"  I think when the Green Goblin killed Gwen Stacy, Spider-Man was a BIT ticked off.  \\"Nobody's ever hit me harder than that.\\"  That may be so, but for such a big threat, he went down pretty damn easily.<br />Speaking of the end, I didn't really like it either.  I felt the humorous lines in the end were just way too out of place.  The whole \\"radiation\\" thing was also pretty tasteless.  (I will concede I liked the last page, though, and am looking forward to the new storyline.)<br />Oh, one last thing.  I HATED Ezekiel.<br />So, all in all, the story was enjoyable, but I felt it misfired on quite a few things.  Maybe I'm a cynical fangirl, but I would have liked a bit more.	2002-01-27
