How would KA Applegate tie up all the loose ends? Would they FINALLY win the war? And who was the character who was rumoured to die? The Beginning answers all those questions, and more, but unfortunately leaves a few things unsaid, like what ever happened to the families of the Animorphs, and the last names of everyone but Jake! To be honest, the first time I read this book I absolutely HATED it. How DARE she do that to the characters I've grown up with?! How DARE she leave me hanging like that in the end?! But when I went back and read it again, I really liked it. While the ending doesn't have them living &quot;happily ever after,&quot; it does paint a pretty realistic picture of life after the war. In one of the earlier books, remember Jake telling Rachel he had no idea what she'd do after the battle was over? How he wasn't even sure what he himself would do? How do you go back to school after (hopefully) saving the planet before you're even old enough to drive? How can you lead a normal life at all? It was cool to see what the Animorphs went on to do, from Cassie working with Hork-Bajir, to Marco becoming a millionaire playboy, surrounded by beautiful supermodels, but not truly as happy as he seems. I loved reading about his life! While the ending was kind of sudden, and made me wanting more, I can see what KA Applegate was going for. The Animorphs deserved to go out fighting . . .	2001-09-22

Cindy's Desert Adventure takes you back, through Cindy's old diary, to the year after Champion won at Dubai. Cindy's eagerly progressing in the racing world, and is happy with her life working at Whitebrook. But Cindy's world gets thrown upside down after a freak accident, and Champion is sent away to live with Sheik al-Rihani in Dubai. Cindy, not able to bear losing the stallion, leaves her home and goes with him as a full-time groom. But life in the UAE is very different than she expected . . . <br />I really enjoyed this book, especially since it answered all the questions we had when Thoroughbred skipped a generation. I can't wait to find out what happens in Cindy's Bold Start, another Lost Diary Special, which takes place in New York. The book was fun to read; the story wasn't written in a diary format, but contained entries from Cindy's diary throughout the chapter. 5 Stars- A must-read for a Thoroughbred fan.	2001-06-16

Lisa has accepted things will never be the same as they were with Alex, and is looking forward to an exciting future with Scott; a relationship she thinks could really turn into something, despite a few problems. Carole and Ben are working harder than ever at the stable, and she has never been happier. The expansion to house the ever-increasing rush of boarders is exciting, even though it's a little hard for her to see Pine Hollow changing so much. Stevie's throwing herself into training for eventing, and Callie's finally enjoying working with Scooby now that George is gone for good. Everyone's looking forward to a bright and happy future now that they've put the problems of the past behind them. But one event can change everything, as the road to the future takes a sudden turn for the worse.<br />Full Gallop was an excellent conclusion to the Pine Hollow series. All the unanswered questions from the previous books were answered, but it wasn't a cheezy tie-up-all-loose-end-so-we-can-finally-finish-the-series book. I really liked reading it, and I cried at the end, which I'm NOT going to give away. It was funny to see the new Veronica at the barn, a stuck-up 12 year old with too much money and not enough brains, and I liked seeing Carole getting somewhere with Ben, as well as Alex with Nicole. I gave it five stars because it's a book any Pine Hollow fan should read, and it was worth the wait.	2001-05-06

Ever wondered what it's like to be a Hogwarts student? How on earth Quidditch developed? And where DO you find a Unicorn? All these questions and more are answered in these great new books!<br />Both books are fun, simple reads, about 60 pages each. Quidditch Through the Ages talks about how quidditch evolved from the odd game played in Queerditch Marsh in the eleventh century, to the world-famous sport it is today. You learn how the Golden Snitch got it's name, and how all the balls became what they are today. (The Snitch used to be a bird they released in the ring, until angry activists protested.) There's also bios on all the teams, and descriptions of good moves on a broomstick. Sprinkled throughout are fun bits of poetry: <br />Oh, the thrill of the chase as I soar through the air<br />With the Snitch up ahead and the wind in my hair<br />As I draw ever closer, the crowd gives a shout<br />But then comes a Bludger and I am knocked out<br />Magical Beasts and Where to Find Them describes many of the common beasts found in the Wizarding World, and their danger levels. Very funny, especially the reviews of the book on the inside cover. <br />&quot;I've read worse&quot;<br />       Rita Skeeter<br />I found them purely by chance when I was shopping this morning, snatched them up, and read both cover to cover, laughingly reading out little excerpts to my sister. As well as being really cool, they have funny little notes scribbled in the margins by Ron, Harry, and Hermione; once again, I'm reminded what a hilarious sense of humor JK Rowling has. Even the covers are funny, Quidditch Through the Ages being Property of Hogwarts Library, and is sealed with a threat from the librarian, Irma Pince, if anything should happen to it; and Magical Beasts and Where to Find them being property of Harry Potter, and Ron too, cuz he lost his, and spent all his money on Dungbombs. So, I definitely recommend these to any hard-core Harry fan. Hey, for 12 bucks, you can do a lot worse!<br />Enjoy!	2001-03-11

The terrible war for Earth between the Yeerks and the Animorphs is drawing to a close. But at what price? The Animorphs, living in hiding in the free Hork-Bajir valley, are beginning to question everything they've ever thought was right. Already they've given the power to morph, at the shock and disgust of the parents, to a band of disabled children, something they'd never have done before. BEFORE the Yeerks knew exactly who they are and where they lived. BEFORE they came after their parents, and the kids had to bring them into the battle. BEFORE they could walk down the street, knowing only one Yeerk could morph. In a war there are sacrifices, and Cassie made the biggest one letting the morphing cube fall into the  hands of the enemy. But now it seems that more sacrifices are going to be made . . .<br />In the previous book, the Animorphs made a bold move, and told the Head of State about the attack. Now it's open warfare, with no one knowing if the general leading your army is on your side . . . or theirs. And the Yeerks are no longer hiding. They have launched a full-out attack, and are bringing thousands of humans to a mass infestation. The final sacfifice is going to be made, as the Animorphs make a horrible plan- to blow up the Yeerk pool, killing hundreds of people and aliens, innocent and not. There's no turning back now . . .<br />I thought this book was fantastic, and I can't WAIT for the next! No Animorph fan can possibly miss out on The Sacrifice. The countdown's begun, and it's gonna get ugly.	2001-03-09

We've got a few secrets left, and we're gonna use them. But just know that the end is coming. And we don't know how much longer we can do this. How much longer we can fight.<br />What about you? Where will you be when it ends? Think about it. Think hard. Because the countdown has already begun. . . .<br />That is the new back for the final four Animorphs books. Because now the Animorphs and Ax have no secrets. And the Yeerks are stronger than ever. The morphing cube has recently switched hands in a previous book, and the Animorphs are now seeing life from the other side. A life of terror, where you're enemy can't be seen, and you don't know if that fly on your finger is really a fly . . . or your greatest enemy. But that's not all. <br />Tensions are mounting in the colony between Jake and the others, especially Cassie. No one knows how to act around their depressed leader, and a secret Cassie's hiding could destroy their trust in her forever.<br />Visser One has begun taking over the National Guard, and this is where #51 begins: With Marco and Tobias watching an army of tanks being brought into the city, in preparation for complete war. Thousands of army and navy members are being brought to be infested, and it's too much for the Animorphs to handle. So they take a risk, a HUGE risk. One that can cost the freedom of the human race. What if they tell the government what's happening? But worse still, what if the government already knows . . .	2001-02-27

All normal words to Luke, an illegal third child living in secret in the near future.<br />It has finally happened. The world can not support itself as more and more babies are born everyday, adding to the ever-increasing popluation. So the government made a law: You may only have two children, one of the many ways they control your life.<br />But what happens if you have MORE? What is life like for these &quot;Shadow Children,&quot; hidden in the house, living life in constant fear that they will be discovered . . . and disposed of. Among the Hidden tells the story of Luke, who lives this life, and how his small step to show the world of the unfairness of this law changes his life, and the lives of those around him, forever.<br />Luke enjoyed spying on the people of the housing deveopment next to his farm. Their coming restricted him from playing outside, so he had watched, first with anger, then with interest, the families moving in. He gave them names, activities, lives. But his spying uncovered a secret. For inside the house of the sports boys, he saw a young girl, peeking out the closed blinds of a darkened room. She was doing as he was. She was like him: a child in hiding. Taking a great risk, Luke went to meet her, and discovered her amazing plan: To hold a rally to bring forth awareness and hopefully acceptance of the Shadow Children. But Luke's strange world soon gets a horrible shock, forcing him to make the hardest decision of his life.	2001-02-04

Many of them, but not all of them. Red and Denise's wedding happens on New Year's Eve, a night that changes many of the characters lives forever. Carole, Cam, Callie, George, Lisa, Alex, Ben, and Scott's lives all take a turn, for better or for worse. <br />Lisa's life finally settles down after insane month, as her Mom makes an important decision about moving to New Jersey, and she and Alex sort out their relationship. Meanwhile Carole finds out something important about Cam, and surprisingly, Ben! Callie's fear of George grows to a point where she can barely stand to think about him. <br />A few people have been complaining about the lack of horses in the series, and they'll be happy to know that as well as the romance parts, horses return! They spend more time on the trails then in TD's, and (GASP!) Bryant's horse talk comes back! Did you know the difference between a canter and a gallop? Now you do! <br />All in all, it was a pretty good book, even though it ended on a cliff-hanger, so now I'm desperate for book sixteen! It was exciting and fast-paced, even though a couple parts seemed a bit rushed, (the last chapter at the barn, for instance.) But it was fun to read, and worth the wait. Great Christmas present!	2000-12-17

The Return was pretty good. <br />Do you remember David, waaaaaaaaaaay back from the earlier books, the three-part miniseries? After seeing his family captured and home destroyed by the Yeerks, the Animorphs were left with a tough decision. Do they leave him, an innocent kid like themselves who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, to become another Controller? Or, now that they have the blue box, Elfangor's morphing cube, do they make him one of them? A human with morph capabilities . . . an Animorph.<br />As you know, they chose the latter, and the small band of six became a small band of seven. Lucky seven. Or so they thought. After a while it became clear that was NOT the case, and his true personality shone through. His EVIL personality. And when he began to try pick them off one by one, they knew something had to be done.<br />They made a trap,and caught him in an ironicly funny morph: a rat. Or so they thought . . .<br />But now David has returned, seomthing they never thought they'd see. At the worst possible time. Because now not only do they have the newly appointed Visser One, who knows the secret of the Hork-Bajir, but David is back . . . And they know how hard it is to stop a morph-capable human- especially one bent on revenge.	2000-11-23

But The Amber Spyglass, in my opinion, is truly a book worth waiting for.<br />Lyra and Will have grown so much from the characters we were introduced to in the first two books. They face horrible suffering for the sake of a promise, and give up everything for the safety of the worlds. Separated from their daemons, and lost in the terrifying World of the Dead, they keep going, tugged by the faint glimmer of hope that they CAN make a difference.<br />The story begins with the hated Mrs. Coulter keeping Lyra in enchanted sleep, as we see a side of her (Coulter) we've never imagined. Caring and kind, but with bitterness in her eyes, she has risked everything for the sake of her child. A battle erupts as both sides, so deeply woven we no longer know which we should root for, try to reach Lyra, one to kill, and the other to 'save'. With the help of the armored bear-king, Will manages to rescue his friend, only to then be put in unspeakable danger. The two are the most sought-after people in all the worlds, and they have their own destiny to create. On the run from the universe, they sneak away in the company of two spies, to finish some unfinished business regarding one of Lyra's friends, and Will's father. And that's only the first few chapters!<br />But meanwhile we're given an inside view of both sides in the enormous war against the Authority, always thinking we know what happens next, but being shocked as the tables turn. We see Dr. Mary Malone venture out into another world, where she learns the secret of the mysterious Dust, and befriends a race of wheeled creatures, whose existence relies on the enormous trees, dying from a Dust related problem. We also watch an assassin slowly creep closer to his mark, and an angel torn apart by the death of his lover.<br />The final battle between God and Lord Asrial's troops is brutal and descriptive, though quite possibly in vain, the one part I didn't like about the book. We finally learn the secret of Dust, and its effect on the world, and we learn the secret of the Subtle Knife, a secret so terrible it's almost better not knowing. The ending left me in tears, as Pullman didn't go for a happy-everything's-resolved-perfectly ending. It was sad but meaningful, and I truly identified with the characters.<br />All in all, it was definitely worth my time, and I recommend it to all Pullman fans, although I don't agree with the age group; I know a lot of adults that have loved it. The story of Lyra and Will is destined to become a classic.	2000-11-12

Amy Candler's seventh grade class is going on their annual class trip, and they have gotten a grant that allows them to travel anywhere in the United States. Amy suggests Washington DC, interested in seeing the place where she was created, the place where scientists, including her 'mother', lives were changed forever. Where it all started, the terror and secrets that have been a part of Amy #7's, a clone, life as long as she has been alive.<br />As well as the story of Amy's trip, we get an insight on Nancy Chandler's life, and why she started working for Project Crescent. Her hopes that her work would someday benefit people like her brother, who's dying from a genetic disease, set her on the path that created the clones. But after meeting another person who worked with the project so many years ago, Amy begins to wonder just how much Nancy has told her . . . and questions her trust in the one person she always thought she'd be safe with.<br />I thought The Beginning was a thrilling read, a book not to be missed by Replica fans. It tells you the full story of Amy's beginning, and the evil leaders of Project Crescent, and is very exciting.	2000-11-12

Mrs. Gladstone's totally against it, but her rodent son is ready to make a killing in the stock market, and won't let anything, not even his mother, stand in his way.<br />I found Rules of the Road to be funny and touching, bringing with it a message of hope.

But anyways,the Animorph asks questions about the fight, whether it's in vain, andwhen the Ellimist doesn't reply, s/he reacts in anger, raging aboutwho the Ellimist really is, and why he's controlling them. TheEllimist answers by telling his story, the story of his many lives,his 'death,' and how he became to be what he is today. A mightycreature stretching throughout the entirety of space, yet a tinycreature too small too see. You get to see him as a low-ranking,unimportant Ketran, to a machine-type creature 'fixing' theuniverse.

Plus, we FINALLY get a glimpse of Callie's dream horse, as a handsome Appaloosa comes to stay, as well as an interesting turn in her 'relationship' with George. But everything's not perfect. Red and Denise drop a bomshell that isn't quite what anyone expected, and the new stable hand, Maureen, doesn't seem to have the best intentions, nor is she what anyone hoped for. And A.J. makes an enormous decision about the search for his birth parents, following up on a lead Stevie uncovers in the local paper. But that's still not all! The back cover of the book makes it seem like Carole's relationship with Cam is all roses and candlelight, but not everything's perfect. I for one am getting a little bit tired of Cam, and it looks like Carole's going to have to stand up to him a bit, before it's too late. <br />All in all, it was a good book, although not the best in the series. But I still can't wait until December to get Pine Hollow 14!	2000-10-23

I think this book was successful in explaining the effects of diabetes on young, active people. It served it's purpose, and was an interesting story to read. It captured the confusion and frustration of a pre-teen girl who was just diagnosed with that life-changing disease. No more treats, sugar, or casual snacking, and the ever present fear of 'going low.' I got a feel for Jessa and her family, but . . . <br />As a book in the StableMates series it really fizzled. Jessa has never acted like this, and her character seemed different, selfish and, at times, quite bratty. The series has always been about horses and riding, but, except for when she was on the trip and riding Jasmine, horses were barely mentioned. Jessa's horse for the week-long trail ride was barely explained, quite unlike the author, and it JUST DIDN'T WORK. I feel Return to Skoki Lae would have served better as a single book, not part of the series. I hope that the next book will focus on riding again, and not diabetes, especially since Jessa's out-growing Rebel, and has begun to move on to riding the pride of the barn, Jasmine.<br />All in all, it was a good book, but if you're interested in a book about horses, I don't recommend it. Try the earlier books in the series, like Rebel of Dark Creek, or Sienna's Rescue.	2000-10-19

I wish I could rate this twice, because I have two different ideas about it. For plot I give it five stars. This is by far one of her best ideas, but . . .<br />It's really written horribly. No expression, no details, just bare bone facts. I coudn't get into it until the very end when Applegate finally began 'writing' again. It's like she had a deadline to make the next day, so just tried to pass this off on the basis that the series' popularity would get people to buy it. She just jumps from place to place and idea to idea; it was like reading a sheet of notes. It's very disappointing, especially since I was looking forward to this one, since Ax is my favourite character, and he's always very funny. Wrong again. If you didn't know it was Ax you'd guess it was Jake: serious and in control. Applegate tossed in a couple 'this isn't my planet, I have to do what's right' lines, but that's the only place you caught a glimpse of Ax. <br />So, way cool plot, with the Animorphs trying to stop Visser Two and the newly appointed Visser One from creating WWIII by bombing China, but disappointing, one star writing.	2000-10-14

I too am in the midst of changing schools, from my local public high school to a private one, although I'm not boarding. I found that Mal is feeling the same way I am, nervous, excited, nervous, sad, nervous and a little bit lonely. <br />   Mallory hasn't been fitting in at school lately, and she's finally going to take some action, and has enrolled in an all-girls boarding school in Massachutes. New friends, new beginnings, and a place that offers a fresh start are awfully tantalising, and although she thinks she's made the right choice, her room-mate Alexis doesn't make it easy for her! <br />   The All-New Mallory Pike really captures the uncertainty you feel when making an important decision in your life, and I would recommend it to BSC fans, especially those like me who've grown out of the series, but aren't totally ready to let go for good!	2000-09-28

Jessa works at Dark Creek Stables in exchange for Rebel's board and feed, and the occasional pointer from the experienced ladies that keep their horses there. But everything changes when two enormous draft horses come to stay. After a run of bad luck and a series of rotten events all brought on by the two, Mrs. Bailey, the owner, is about ready to give up. How on earth will little Dark Creek survive this troublesome pair? Jessa's put out, too, as Rebel has to live out in the cold, giving up his nice, warm home for a drafty little shed so the newcomers can have a place to stay. But that's not all. Jessa's life is suddenly turned upside down when her FATHER arrives on a surprise visit from Japan, where he's been living with his new wife and daughter. It's a tense time that Christmas, especially when the hugest blizzard Jessa's ever seen rocks Vancouver Island, shutting everyone up at home, and closing all the airports. Mr. Richardson's going to have to stay with his ex-wife and daughter for the holidays, and they'll definitely be much different than anyone expected, especially when Jessa joins a rescue crew with a pair of VERY unlikely helpers!<br />I loved this book just as much as the first, and can never tire of Nikki Tate's wonderfully descriptive style. I felt like I was right there with Jessa, and I especially enjoyed all the little plots she wove in with the one big one.	2000-09-24

Jessa has always dreamed of getting a horse of her own. But with her father living in Japan, and her mother juggling night school and a day job, it looks like that's out of the question. There's just no way they could possibly afford more than the one group lesson a week, Jessa's only chance to be around her favourite animals. But in response to her mother's sign offering book-keeping skills in exchange for lessons, board, or lease, Jessa meets Rebel, a spunky bay pony whose owner doesn't have enough time. It seems too good too be true, especially since Rebel's offered under a FREE lease! But it is true, and the answer to Jessa's problems. While looking into working of her board at the stunningly beautiful Arbutus Lane, Jessa learns about Dark Creek Stables, an ''Old Lady Barn'' that needs help with mucking, feeding, and all those other seemingly endless barn chores. It may not be Rabutus Lane, but the owner, Mrs. Bailey, offers Jessa board and feed in exchange for her help. Suddenly everything's PERFECT in her life; with a best friend helping out, a trail ride buddy who might want to be more than friends, and the horse of her dreams, Jessa doesn't want anything to change. She's even entered in a Hunter Classic show she thinks she just might have a chance at winning. But of course, things can't stay 100% perfect for long, as she soon finds out.<br />I really enjoyed this book, and all the other books in the StableMates series. They're a nice change from the other repetitive horse books out there, and Nikki Tate has a wonderful style in her writing. I definitely recommend this series to anyone who likes (or even doesn't like!) horses!	2000-09-24

Books you think back on and say, &quot;Oh yeah, that was an okay  story.&quot; Lots of authors will spin a simple tale around the subject of  dolphins because it's a popular topic that many people like. When I bought  The Music of Dolphins at a book fair, I thought I was getting just that: a  simple story about a girl raised by dolphins. Nothing new, nothing  exciting, nothing captivating. Boy was I ever wrong.<br />The Music of  Dolphins features a teenage girl found off Cuba, in the midst of her only  real family, a group of dolphins. Mila, as she is dubbed, speaks no  language but the clicks and cries of her cousins, as she calls the animals.  This incredible story follows her growth as a human, in her own simple  writing, as she learns what she truly is, and what she truly wants to be.  As she progresses she discovers more and more about what this life she's  been forced into means, and the pain and sadness that come with it. You  will truly feel Mila's emotions, and will cry when you realize the decision  she makes at the end. Maybe it's the right one, and maybe it's not, but  this profound story will make you think about who you are, through the eyes  of a girl who is different in ways you can only imagine.	2000-08-20

So much happened in the 200+ pages it's unbelievable!<br />Alex and Lisa have  barely been broken up when Alex starts fishing around, for Nicole Addams.  So Lisa has to decide whether or not she wants to start dating again. I  guessed who she's go with, but it was still surprising to see the way he (I  don't want to name names!) felt about her. And no matter how good they seem  together, it's hard for me, as a reader, and Lisa to get used to it.  Meanwhile, Carole's old blast from the past, Cam Nelson, has moved back to  Willow Creek, and is letting EVERYONE know how he feels about Carole. They  can't imagine life without eachother. and already Carole's planning their  farm in the country, with her as Mrs. Cam Nelson. One relationship ends and  a new one starts, right? But Lisa's about to face an even huger problem in  her life. Her Mom's gotten a new, terrible idea in her head, and Lisa  doesn't think she can cope. All these problems keep piling up, and on top  of that, no matter how happy she is for them, seeing Cam and Carole so  happy and in love isn't helping. But it's not all serious. There are some  VERY funny bits about Stevie's idea in the previous book, that Scott  Forester is secretly pining for her. And a few funny comments pop up when  Callie begins shopping for a new horse. The perfect horse just can't be  found, and with her luck that 'seasoned endurance Arab' will be a goat!  Plus, her 'relationship' with a certain moon-faced, pudgy rider takes a  highly interesting turn . . . All in all, this is a fantastic Pine Hollow  book, and the most romantic of them all. If you like Pine Hollow books,  this is not one to miss out on!	2000-08-11

I own all the Animorphs books, and lately they've been, well, a disappointment. Disappointing, boring, dull, tedious, simple, no matter how  you say it, KA Applegate seemed to have lost her touch. The size of the  books shortened, too. Now they were short on top of that! But The  Unexpected spun everything around. It looks like Applegate has gone off and  found her talent again, and this book was fantastic! <br />Cassie has always  been the weakest of the Animorphs, and you notice that again in this one.  Her kill 'em and cry over 'em attitude, as I think the Drode suggested in  an earlier novel, was evident again, as she fought the Hork-Bajir on a  plane going to ?  As it turns out, she's on the road to the Australian  Outback, and is going to find a love interest (what would Jake say! )  among a native boy. As if Cassie doesn't have enough on her hands, what  with getting home and all, the boy's grandfather gets a horrible pussing  wound, that takes up almost his entire leg, from a piece of a Bug Fighter,  and Cassie alone has to try and save him. Then Visser Three arrives, and  begins a struggle to live, and save the natives. I throughly enjoyed  hearing about the Yeerk invasion from another point of view, and I think  Cassie's attitude may change a bit in the next books in the series. After  being able to talk about the Yeerks to another person, and getting a view  entirely different from what her friends say, think it'll pain her less to  do what you gotta do to save the world. A great book, and exciting to the  end.	2000-08-10

I've ridden for four years now, and have always dreamed of doing just what Mousie did. It sent shivers up and down my spine just thinking about having the skill  to be asked to come to Europe and ride before the Queen. I loved reading  about Dancer and Mousie, whether she was saving him from a kidnapping, or  jumping the perfect jump at an exhibition. I loved the mystery and thrill  Ms. Peterson put into the book, never brushing by small details, but making  you feel that you were right there with Mousie, watching Dancer show off  his breath-taking talent. There was never a dull moment. Her style of  writing makes things that could be boring in some authors' hands, like  choosing the clothes to take on the trip, seem exciting and fun, as you  could sense the happiness Mousie and her mother felt. I read Dancer from  cover to cover in a day, and eagerly went searching for Abby Malone. Even  though the book is classified as 'a horse book,' I think everyone would  enjoy reading it. It's not just another horse story, it's filled with  suspense, action, and a bit of romance, (not to mention the perfect horse!)  and once you pick it up, you can't put it down. I hope Ms. Peterson  continues to amaze us with her books, and can't wait until the next one's  out!	2000-07-22

Abby is a girl who, unlike Mousie, the heroine of Dancer, doesn't own her dream horse. She has her eye on Moonlight Sonata, a  beautiful mare, and is lucky enough to get the chance to ride her, after a  very interesting incident. A more real life novel, Abby has to deal with  serious problems, like an alcohalic mother, and a father in jail for a  crime she beleives he didn't do. I loved the action and suspense, and truly  felt Abby's emotions as she dealt with cruel reality. Once again, Ms.  Peterson has written a fabulous novel, and think animal lovers everywhere  will love Abby Malone as much as I do. It was a great touch to have Mousie  'drop by' in it, now soon-to-bemarried to her love from Dancer. I hope Ms.  Peterson gives us another novel as fabulous as Abby Malone and Dancer, but  in the meantime I'll have to be content re-reading them over and over and  over. I know I'll never get tired of the excitement and thrill these books  bring.	2000-07-22

I had bought The Dream Catcher ...... at a book sale, not realising it followed Devil On My Back, (also a fantastic book) and loved it. It easily stands alone, and is even better after reading the  first book about the Arcs. As soon as I finished it I rushed out to get  Devil. . . and it enhanced Ruth's experiences even more greatly, clarifying  her dreams, etc. Both books are incredible, bringing forth an amazing  world, that, no matter how far-out, is totally believable, with charcaters  I could happily relate to. Not only was the series enjoyable, I was touched  by many parts, especially Tomi's change, and the freedom song.<br />So the  freedom man danced out of the Arc<br />Over the hills so shady<br />Into the  night and out of the dark<br />To be with his long-haired lady<br />(I apaologise  if that's not correct, I'm going from memory.) I was especially touched by  the fact that this world does not exist, yet  Monica Hughes has created  such a moving song of hope and pride, that I could picture the people  sitting around a roaring fire, singing of their happiness and the dreams of  a &quot;world made free&quot; as another verse says.

She took her characters and really added to their  life as witches and wizards. They, among other things, went to see the  Quidditch World Cup, which I found an exciting addition, and a part that  could even be a book itself, where the terror and intrigue you always find  in a Harry Potter book started, with the return of the terrible Death  Eaters, the followers of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. She described so vividly  their return, in a way that sent horrifying prickles down my spine, the  same way the first chapter, already bringing sudden deaths, did. But on a  lighter side, even though evilk always stalks Hogwarts, Harry, Hermione and  Ron, did begin to grow up, and found romance of sorts where they'd least  expect it . . . I don't want to give anything away, but the action, and the  danger with it, was unbelievable. Harry faces his greatest challenge yet,  in more ways then one. No one is who you think they are, and no one can be  trusted. A friend may not be, and an enemy might change. The ending was  troubling, and left us wondering what is to become of the not-so-perfect  life of the wizarding community. It left me with an unsettled feeling that  something's just not right, and left me wanting to know more. But even as  secrets are left, many are revealed. The mystery of Herry's parents is  told, and you learn something rather startling about one of Harry's close  friends, Neville. Although this was certainly the darkest of all of her  books, I feel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was definitely a success.

I found the plot simple and, although imaginitive, extremely predictable. The author came across completely full of himself, in more ways than one. The constant little reminders that &quot;If you like stories with happy endings, you  should quit reading here,&quot; were constant and, for lack of a better  word, annoying, as I found nothing frightening at all about the book, and  felt them a waste of paper. The only reason I gave the book two stars was  because I thought the idea, that nothing good shall ever happen to the  children, was a good one.But it got way too old, way too fast. I also  didn't enjoy the way the story would be interrupted with explanations about  &quot;big words.&quot; What is the point of that? I have seen Lemony  Snicket's books compared to Harry Potter, but I see nothing in common at  all. While Harry Potter is a well-written, highly enjoyable series, I found  the Bad Beginning to be just that, a BAD book.	2000-07-02

Rowling when I saw the sign 'What to Read After Harry Potter.' I immediately clicked on, eager to see what was recommended.  And I saw this fantastic book.       I began my journey  into the kingdom of Linderwall last year. I gleefully followed Cimorene on  her adventures as the Kazul's (a dragon's!) princess, and couldn't WAIT for  more.  But no matter how many book stores I looked in I couldn't find the  rest of the series.  So imagine my delight when I looked here.     Dealing  With Dragons is an incredible read.  It has everything a book needs:  excitement, adventure, a touch of romance, and a highly believable main  character. Who can honestly say that they haven't felt the way Cimorene  does: sick and tired of their life, in her case a boring life of a  princess, with nothing better to do then 'lady-like activities'.       So  the princess sets out to stop being a princess, with a great outcome.  Turning away princes who come save her?  As if she needs saving! It's a  wonderful twist on the fairy tales of weak princesses being captured by  vicious dragons, and being saved by the big strong princes. Cimorene  volunteers to be a dragon's princess; if anyone needs saving it's those  princes who come to 'rescue' her.        I definitely recommend this book  to anyone and everyone.  And the last thing I say is, &quot;ENJOY!&quot;	2000-04-29
