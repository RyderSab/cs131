Nearly every page of this book conveys valuable insights into the nature of programming. The book is readable and entertaining, a professional book you'll read for pleasure and re-read.  Weinberg adds no new chapters, nor does he edit obsolete content.  Even the pagination is the same as in the original.  Instead the Silver Anniversary Edition appends to each chapter a &quot;Comments on the chapter&quot; section in which the author relates the content you've just read to the world of today.	2001-06-24

Kerth makes little distinction between reviewing (a) the end product of the project and (b) the performance of the project team.  I recommend these chapters to discerning experienced project leaders as a supplement to a comprehensive book on project management.<br />The early chapters, on the other hand, are loaded with naive misconceptions, e.g. on what a &quot;successful project&quot; is and an obsession with measuring &quot;lines of code&quot;.  They could actually do harm if taken seriously by a naive manager.<br />The self-indulgent writing may approach a record for use of the first-person pronoun.	2001-06-24

Although OS/360 and its successors were enormously successful in the long run, its early days were plagued by highly publicized schedule slippages, deferred features, and unplanned incompatibilities.    Dr. Brooks shares with the readers the lessons he learned from    those experiences, written from the perspective of just a few years later, after he had left IBM for the academic world.	2001-06-24

Karl Wiegers makes the clearest and most convincing case I've seen yet for a disciplined approach to gathering and documenting detailed users' requirements.  This is a must-read for:<br /> -  project managers, <br /> -  skeptical I.T. managers, esp. start-up entrepreneurs <br /> -  systems analysts, esp. less experienced ones<br /> -  open-minded sponsoring user representatives<br />This work, however, provides little practical guidance on how to actually do the analysis.  Wiegers has the right idea in balancing established structured analysis (SA) with recent UML techniques, but the details and examples are much too sparse and vague to serve as a guide (e.g. data definition).<br />Highly recommended for anyone who thinks doing it right is a &quot;luxury&quot; his or her organization can't afford in today's competitive Internet-time-driven world.	2000-12-28

In the preface, the editor explains that this collection of essays arose from a &quot;brainstorming session for a conference of the same name.&quot;  As you'd expect with over a dozen authors, the results are uneven.  If you're involved in software development, the following chapters will justify your purchase of the book:<br />-  Don Gray:  &quot;Solving Other People's Problems&quot;<br />-  S.M. &amp; K. Roberts: &quot;Do I want to Take This Crunch Project?&quot;<br />-  Gerald Weinberg: &quot;Congruent Interviewing by Audition&quot; <br />-  Johanna Rothman: &quot;It's Just the First Slip&quot;<br />Although the critical reader may find some other sections offering commonplace or occasional misguided advice, the whole book is stimulating and easy to read in one sitting.

As other reviewers have noted, Alhir's material is like the handout from a  presentation:  mostly bullet points but fairly well structured.  I  recommend it as a first place to look before consulting your primary  sources.<br />Reviewing books about the UML is challenging, because it's often  hard to separate flaws in the presentation from shortcomings in the UML  itself.	2000-03-09

It makes a strong beginning with an overview of the main features and concepts of STL, but the rest consists of alphabetically ordered and painfully repetitive  specifications for each class.  <br />Usage examples are contrived with no  connection to real-world programming problems.

Each  chapter is like a separate out-of-context article.<br />Langer steers a  balanced course between competing methogologies, pointing out, as few other  books do, that we should integrate the principles of object-oriented  analysis into the proven framework of structured analysis.  Much of what's  here is good, but there isn't enough of it.<br />I recommend The Art of  Analysis for supplementary reading by the experienced systems analyst, but  not as a textbook from which to learn systems analysis.	1999-05-03

Unlike many Java insiders, he doesn't try to persuade us that Java is the perfect tool for every situation.  Although his enthusiasm comes through, he concedes a  few Java shortcomings and openly criticizes some particularly egregious  flaws that others present unapologetically (e.g. Java's Calendar/Date  abomination; the choice of &quot;static&quot; for class member).  <br />The  structure and sequence are suitable either as a textbook for an OOP/Java  course or for self study by an experienced programmer.<br />I found it easy to  find answers to a number of issues that were either omitted or hard to find  in two dozen other well-regarded Java texts on my shelf.	1999-04-29

This book focuses on developing an unambiguous system specification which both the sponsoring end users and  the developers can understand.  <br />The examples are clear and well chosen,  small enough to be understood, big enough not to be trivial.  This is an  excellent main textbook for a course in systems analysis.<br />The  documentation methodology is derived from the classic DeMarco  &quot;structured analysis&quot;.  The book's main weakness is insufficient  treatment of object-oriented concepts, especially in data definition.	1999-04-10

The perceptive  reader will notice a few, however, that conflict with modern practice in  C++ and Java (e.g. mixing boolean and integer expressions).  <br />Every  programmer using C, C++, or Java should be acquainted with everything in  this book and either comply with it or have a good reason for not doing so.	1998-08-25

If you substituted \\"client-server\\" or just \\"large systems\\" for \\"object oriented\\" most of the content would still apply.<br />Despite its lack of specific O.O. guidance, the advice Webster gives us is sound.

Experienced C++ programmers will be able to figure out many of the typos and other errors, such as a backward typedef (p.11), a parameter name change (p.12), and == where != was intended (p.219).     More disturbing are some surprisingly naive coding techniques, such as assignment operators returning void (p.318), bizarre sequences of do-nothing statements (p.312), integer exponentiation by repeated multiplication (p.329), and strange packaging of unrelated constants (p.305).  <br />Despite its serious flaws, this book contains a number of useful ideas and techniques, and emphasizes numerical techniques that are ignored by many C++ books.
