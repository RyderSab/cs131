Satch Carlson was born in a small California town that even now refuses to admit it. He spent his early years in Nevada, where at the age of five he got his first lesson of serving others when he lost a finger trying to keep the main door of the municipal swimming pool from slamming shut and startling people. His formative years were spent in Reno (where he learned the rules of blackjack and social decorum). In 1967 he moved to Anchorage, Alaska, to pursue the murder of trout and salmon and other living things, and found himself graduating from Alaska Methodist University two years later.  He promptly went to work for the Anchorage Daily News. He counts as his highest achievement the winning of the 1988 International Imitation Hemingway Contest, prompting one critic to remark, \\"Here is Carlson doing what he does best: imitating a writer.\\"	2005-10-14

From Adam Crabtree's patients who heard \\"voices inside their heads\\" to Elizabeth Kubler-Ross on death and dying, from Rudolf Steiner and Madame Blatavsky to Kenneth Ring and Raymond Moody. Colin Wilson examines theories, trends, and phenomena in an effort to reach a conclusion to this most perplexing issue.<br /><br />Wilson also offers hundreds of case histories and anecdotes on topics as diverse as split brain research, apparitions, telepathy, the magic of primitive man, pre-cognition, out of body experience, A-consciousness and B-consciousness, vampires, the subliminal mind, past lives, the mystery of multiple personalities, and contact with the dead. He asks and answers questions on how far we can trust the evidence given by mediums, the presence of spirits in madness, how we lost our psychic powers, why the Victorians were skeptical of the occult, can personality survive death, are spirit controls sub-personalities, and most important, \\"What happens after death?\\"	2005-10-04

An autobiography of Tom Matthews.<br /><br />Tom Matthews has always been an enigma to his numberless friends on both sides of the Atlantic. Why didn't he become a bishop like his terrifying father? He could have carried a pastoral staff with equal aplomb. Or a millionaire tycoon in Ivory Soa, the family business? He has great executive gifts. Or a full time writer? His two early novels and his few powerful poems show that he could have made a big name for himself. Why on earth did he spend the best years of his life slaving for Time (of all man-eating magazines) and eventually editing it for seven years? We could not guess. This brilliant autobiography supplies the answer; and the pay-off about his his final breach with Henry Luce of Time is what we have been waiting to read for years.

They focus their report upon the capture of Hank Blood and Bety Olsen, two American missionaries, and Mike Benge, a USAID agricultural advisor.<br /><br />Falsely identified as U.S. Military collaborators, the three were chained together and force marched through the jungle for many months. The most relentless enemy proved to be malnutrition, as the captives were denied basic food necessities and medical care. Debilitation took its toll as first Hank, then Betty, died an agonizing death on the trail...but not before their unwavering courage and forgiving love for their persecutors touched Mike Benge's heart, and he found new faith in God.<br /><br />Eventually released from a Hanoi prison camp, Benge has told his story to the authors of No Time For Tombstones.

Rev. Msgr. Edward J. Flanagan, better known as Father Flanagan on Dec. 10, 1917, with a borrowed $90 to pay the first month's rent on a building at 25th and Dodge Streets in Omaha. The home was started with 5 boys, 3 from the juvenile court and 2 homeless newsboys. In a short time though, the quarters were crowded and the home was moved to the German-American Club on South 13th Street, which stood vacant as a result of the war. Here 150 boys could be cared for, but soon it was crowded again and  so Father Flanagan purchased the 160 acre Overlook Farm, 10 miles West of Omaha. From this humble beginning, Boys Town grew into 1,500 acres and 50+ buildings.<br /><br />Illustrated with old photos.	2005-09-06

Paul Galambos, professor of experimental psychology, is a frustrated, power-hungry man. That's why he answers a crytic magazine ad for specialists in his field and finds himself abducted into the well-paid employ of NESTER...New England Sensory Testing and Engineering Research. In the manufactured environment of the vast cream-colored compound, Paul tests human subjects manipulating them through the latest technical advances in brain control.<br /><br />Instoxicated by the possibilities at NESTER, Paul eagerly sheds every vestige of his former life to become a willing prisoner, dedicating himself to a series of profoundly immoral experiments. His position is a dream come true. His superior, Mr. Worthington, goads him on with incentives...spying missions, exclusive experiments on sexual behavior, promises of still more power.<br /><br />How does it all turn into comic frenzy?

In the summer of 1962, John Hyde, an American landscape architect, and his wife Moira return to Hyde's fishing camp on the Mallabec River in New Brunswick for the first time in 20 years. Nearby live a young couple named Talbot: Kate Talbot's parents had been neighbors and friends of the Hydes on this same river in 1939. When young Robin Hyde joins his parents, we know all but one one of the principled characters of David Walker's tense novel.<br /><br />Through a skillful flashback to that earlier time at the river, we discover the dark events in the background which persist through the new generations of these two families. In subtle counterpoint, tragedy is re-enacted and the earlier evil remorselessly demands its price.<br /><br />This is a novel of human tensions developing against the strong background of forest, river, and animal life. David Walker combines here his insights into the human heart and his love of the natural world of which we are part. The reader lives and loves and suffers with John Hyde by the Mallabec, cryptic and serene, but violent at the rapids.	2005-08-23

Kaufman and Moss Hart. It was rumored that the new play was based on the life of the most eminent critic and public personality of the nation. But it was no secret at all. The acid-tongued, infuriating, impossible \\"hero\\" in the great spoof The Man Who Came to Dinner portrayed, of course, none other than Alexander Woollcott, Drama critic, columnist, author and playwright. Woollcott is perhaps best remembered for his frothy broadcasts as the Town Crier, who dissected anything and anyone. He possessed a magnetic power over people who heard his voice, and his sharp wit and often prophetic insights on the current scene and trends won him respect and notoriety. He also played a public role...that of Alexander Woollcott, bad boy of stage and radio.<br /><br />The portrait of the vituperative commentato was one portrait of him. There was another though of his softer nature. He helped hundreds of people in different ways...from getting them out of prison to supporting them through college, finding them jobs, and giving them sums of money, large and small, that he knew he would never be repaid.<br /><br /> The biography of a very complex person.	2005-07-20

Nevertheless, Perdita became the protege of the Red Castle's wealthy inhabitants, who included two girls her own age. One was beautiful and imperious, the other gentler and more vulnerable, who suffered from an accidental disfigurement that in reality affected her spirit more than her looks.<br /><br />Through some surpising developments, Perdita made a brilliant marriage...indeed, to the young man who was to have married the Red Castle beauty. But her happiness and even her life were then threatened as she became prey to a strange combination of forces. There was a conspiracy linked to her own mysterious heritage.  There as also, most disturbingly, a secret obligation of her husband's. And there was the sinister story of the Red Castle itself, in which dark legends and old tragedies of the past lived on hauntingly in the troubled present.<br /><br />Takes place in the \\"elegant world of candlelight and carriages\\".

For two years Gerald Schomp was a paid, professional patriot for one of the most astonishing socio-political organizations of our time. With naive enthusiasm he promulgated the party line until his rude awakening during an angry public confrontation with an illerate Negro garbageman. His ironic, devastating account of life among the Birchers provides one of the most enlightening, absorbing...and entertaining...political exposes of this or any other year.<br /><br />If anyone ever accused the John Birch Society of being blackly  comic, the charge would be angrily and humorlessly refuted. Yet Schomp has written a book that is almost as funny as it is tragic: the story of a professional superpatriot tirelessly fighting to save the world from (...or for?...) Communism and the \\"International Conspiracy\\" of \\"Insiders\\". Secretive yet messianic, the Birch Society and its founder, Robert Welch, are tenacious anachronisms in contemporary society. And the Birchers themselves? Take it from a man who knows: \\"In general, Birchers are the 'least likely' people in the world.\\"<br /><br />What is the mystique of the Birch Society that attracts so many fervent and silent sympathizers? Where does the money come from? Who is Robert Welch and how has he managed to maintain monolithic control over so many followers? How does a quasi-secret society recruit volunteers? And neither last nor least...where does the JBS stand in relation to Jews, Negroes, and the conservatives of this country?<br /><br />Schomp traces the fascinating route of right-wing extremism from orgies of patriotism to mass paranoia, monomaniacal devotion to \\"duty\\", and finally to its inevitable and frightening public climax. His unsparing honesty and insight offer serious, provacotive reading to Americans of every political persuasion.<br /><br />189 pages. Index.uasion.<br /><br />189 pages. Index.	2005-07-10

The secret lifes of America's most successful undercover agent.<br /><br />Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano (Salvatore Lucania) also knew Sal Vizzini as a \\"friend,\\" a U.S. Air Force Major called \\"Michael Anthony Cerra\\" who for three years conducted an off-and-on palship in Naples with the exiled Mafia capo.<br /><br />Here, in his own words and for the first time, Vizzini draws on hitherto classified Bureau files to detail the proof of Luciano's inflence from overseas with the syndicate, especially in his beloved New York. It was at Luciano's villa in Rome that \\"Major Mike Cerra\\" saw Luciano receive pay off money from Frank Costello; send warnings to such as Vito Genovese and Carlo Gambino that their accounts were in arrears (they paid up, plus interest); as judge and jury of a Mafia court condemn or reprieve wayward associates (they called him \\"the peacemaker\\").<br /><br />It was also at Luciano's ville or Naples apartment that Vizzini, during games of gin rummy, heard from The Man his charge that he'd been framed by one-time Governor of New York Tom Dewey, his story of how he helped the U.S. Navy during WWII, how he got the name \\"Lucky\\" and why his friends who knew better never used it, and his disclosures about the Mafia, who ran it, and his continuing role in it...indiscretions that led to arrests thousands of miles away.<br /><br />For 13 years Sal Vizzini was undercover, infiltrating a heroin factory in Palermo, exposing the top-and-underdogs of the heroin traffic in Istanbul, Beirut and Marseilles, blowing up the largest concentration of hard drugs under one roof in a Southeast Asian heroin factory, and finally blowing his cover as a croupier in San Juan while trying to expose the cocaine smuggling that allegedly helped finance Castro's regime.<br /><br />Sal managed to live to retire, and then to take on the position of Chief of Police, City of South Miami.	2005-07-09

Not since the days of the Louisiana Purchase has America seen any bigger real estate transactions than those executed by William Zeckendorf, the derring-do head of Webb & Knapp. Figuring with supersonic speed and an uncanny flair for making money, the flamboyant impressario bought and sold property, remodeled whole sections of New York, Denver, Washington, Montreal and Dallas, and moved the UN, the capital of the world, to New York. At the peak of his power, he was a man with the Midas touch in an age of computers.<br /><br />He played a real life game of Monopoly and won the largest real estate empire in the world...so large, in fact, that Wall Street tottered when he went bankrupt. And bankrupt he was, but never in spirit.<br /><br />An autobiography bursting with vitality, enthusiasm, and financial know-how, he reveals himself as a visionary whose creativeness and sense of adventure are matched only by his unalloyed joy at being able to successfully juggle a dozen incredibly complicated transactions at once.<br /><br />Zeckendorf's grandfather was a German immigrant and Indian trader who, in 1868, established a store in Tucson, Arizona (Steindorf's).

The story of one man's search for paradise. Bernard Gorsky (from France) was attracted to Polynesia, but he found \\"civilization\\" already rampant there. Tahiti swarmed with tourists and cars, the Wallis Islands were already pre-occupied with political development....<br /><br />But, as he travelled, the natural world gradually assumed precedence. On Kunie he joined the local equivalent of a fox-hunt (the fox is a turtle). On Lifou, at the women's Saturday's cricket match (cricket taught them by English whalers) the applause of the watching men is underscored by the slapping tails of a school of whales off shore.<br /><br />Eventually he reached Mouli. The natives were amazed at his request to stay...the first European ever to stop more than a few hours. They accepted him and built him a hut. They gave him a great banquet (and fed him the great local delicacy...the yellow fat from the ventral sac of the coconut crab).<br /><br />To a European the community of Mouli presents a surprising contrast of social maturity and primitive habits: there are pigs trained as pets like dogs, giant crawfish, large enough to take a man: men fish like sea eagles, leaping from a cliff with a trident.<br /><br />Gorsky tells a moving and fascinating story of a year spent with good and simple people, and it is illustrated with more than 60 wonderful color photographs that he took on his journey.	2005-06-04

Translated from the French by Thelma Niklaus<br /><br />Illustrated by Margery Gill<br /><br />With a new introduction by Charlotte A. Gallant<br /><br />Gregg Press Publishers<br /><br />A boy and a girl, survivors of an unknown accident, find themselves lost on a mountain without any memory of how they came to be there. They discover a tiny baby strapped in his carrying case and add him to their little group. But about themselves they can remember only that their names are Franz and Lydia.<br /><br />When the children fail to find a path down the mountain, they realize they will have to take cre of themselves and the baby until they are rescued. They find a village but it is deserted. Lydiaa finds a little house that is snug and homelike; Franz discovers an Alpine hut stocked with provisions, even a few books, and the children begin to settle in. By the time winter comes, they have made themselves secure against the weather and the loneliness.<br /><br />\\"The strength of this story lies not only in the ingenious ways of survival but in the character development of the children as they fight despair, help each other, and come to realize that their days will be exactly what they have the courage to make them.\\" Quote from  Library Journal.	2005-05-19

Alley Jaggers, Paul West's first novel about the bizarre Jaggers family of Shalethorpe, was received with wild enthusiam by the critics. Bold comparisons were made to Beckett, Joyce, Updike, and Gunter Grass, among others.<br /><br />I'm Expecting to Live Quite Soon takes us where Alley left off; Alley's locked up for murder, Dad's put away in the Old Folks', and Dot...an earthy, foul-mouthed Midlands housewife who joins Molly Bloom, and Brecht's Mother Courage in the pantheon of great female characters...is left to her own grand devices.  A job at the local pub leads to a highly unusual form of prostitution when Dot meets the Armpit Man. Deliberately pregnant, she further outrages the village by taking in a black lodger; when baby Hopalong arrives, the scorned mother and child set off on a strange journey south only to discover trouble all over again, and yet another virtue to win from necessity.<br /><br />This ebullient novel exuberantly and bawdily celebrates life's richness and ripeness as well as the value of words., whether for raving, communicating, or simply fending people off. Forcing his characters toward existential extremes. Paul West works their estrangement into an image...a profound and festively funny image...of human persistence, courage, and vision.<br /><br />This sequel to Alley Jaggers stands as a brilliant novel in its own right, a more penetrating, more accessible, more moving book than Alley.	2005-05-07

Dana Kirk developed a reputation for taking over struggling basketball programs and turning them into winners. From the coalfields of West Virginia to the glitter of the Final Four, Kirk's teams have played an aggressive, fast-paced game which has brought enjoyment to countless fans.<br /><br />Off the court, Kirk put his quieter nature on the shelf to adopt an outgoing personality, which has made him nationally famous. Draping himself in loud clothes, he attracted attention to the success-starved basketball teams he inherited. Later, dressed more conservatively, his distinctive manner led him into charity fundraising motivational speaking and commercial endorsements, all while turing Memphis State University into a national basketball power. At Memphis State, Kirk perfected his technique of attracting money and success to a struggling team. His Tigers found a regular home in the national rankings, becoming one of the winningest teams in the country, and earning him national coaching honors.<br /><br />After the NCAA began probing Memphis State for alleged administrative wrongdoing, Kirk was fired in 1986. Weeks later, he was indicted by a federal grand jury. His world of basketball x's and o's became a jungle of lawsuits and countersuits.<br /><br />With the results of all his court actions still pending, Dana Kirk comes forward with the real story of what winning is about in college sports, naming names and pointing fingers where the need arises.<br /><br />Kirk's opinions run from the great (and not so great) of college coaches to the best of the broadcast booth, with time devoted for newly-revealed stories of an incredible rocket ride from the mountains of Appalachia to the zenith of college athletics.<br /><br />And as the situation unravels at Memphis State, Kirk tells all he knows about what was going on in public...and behind closed doors.	2005-05-05

Autobiography of Captain Harry Grattidge, former Commodore of the Cunard Line as told to Richard Collier, with photos;, personal observations of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Queen Elizabeth-the Queen Mother, and other famous people. Dust jacket reads: This richly entertaining story of a 50-year career on the high seas-a career which began in the sunset days of sailing ships, saw the development of great ocean liners, was shadowed by tragedy and danger in both World Wars, and culminated in the proudest post in the British Merchant Marine. There is hardly a Cunard liner that Captain Grattidge has not served on-from Laconia, the old Mauretania, and the Berengaria to the two great Queens. And there is hardly an eminent world traveler about whom he does not have fascinating stories-the Duchess of Windsor, Field Marshal Montgomery, Ezio Pinza, Bernard Baruch, Bing Crosby, Gertrude Lawrence, H.G. Wells, Lord Mountbatten, Lawrence of Arab, the Emir Feisal, Bob Hope and scores of others. Renowned figures move familiarly through these pages, often in unfamiliar poses. There was the affair of the Russian cigars and Churchill's largeminded disregard of British customs regulations. There was the episode of Lana Turner's hairdo which the Captain impishly asked her to change in the middle of an evening as a joke on passengers who were slavishly imitating her. There was the astonishing moment when Captain Grattidge heard the strains of a band playing on a supposedly empty ship and discovered that the leader was the then Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII. Here, too, are moments of high drama-as in the terrible disaster of the sinking of the Lancastria off St. Nazaire with nearly 6,000 aboard and more than 2,500 soldiers lost. Or the time during world War I when Captain Grattidge's torpedoed ship titled so monstrously that he could see the moon through a hole in her side. Or the tense meeting between Eden and Molotov on board the Franconia, temporary headquarters for the British delegation during the Yalta conference. A captain of the great Cunarders must be more than an expert seaman, he must also take all passengers, high and low, under his care for the duration of a voyage. Because people have the duration of a voyage. Because people have the habit of shedding restraints on an ocean trip, Grattidge has had to cope with every king of human problem from straightening out the affairs of a lovesick teenager to assisting the plans of a Captain of Industry. Grattidge's sympathetic and acute knowledge of both sides of his job gives his personal story its fascination and unique human quality.delegation during the Yalta conference.

When the time came to take first vows she was not in the least certain God was calling her.<br /><br />Here is the sensitive, personal story of Midge Turk's life as Sister of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, from the time she chooses to enter the silent, regimented life of the convent to the moment 18 years later when she makes the painful decision to leave. It is the story of a young Catholic nun, a 20th century woman striving to live according to the inflexible rules of formal religious life as laid down centuries ago, of how she and her community of uniqely aware Sisters, who were called \\"The Hollywood Nuns,\\" struggled to work within the tradition of the Church.<br /><br />Follow her as she tries to follow the letter and spirit of her religion; teaching, cooking, cleaning, taking courses, begging permission to stay awake extra hours to complete all the tasks allotted her. Her personal experiences...from her first days as a young teaching nun to her last years as a superior in Los Angeles' Mexican-American ghetto are touching, hilarious, painful.<br /><br />This intimate biography of a young woman's search to find herself is set against the background of momentous events in the Roman Catholic Church that led 315 of the 400 Sisters of her community to abandon formal religious life and form a secular community.<br /><br />After she left, she became an editor of a major New York woman's magazine.	2005-01-04

Professor Burn examines the life and thought of the generation living between 1852 and 1867 in order to understand the unusual character of a people remarkably satisfied with themselves.<br /><br />There was a particular strength and unity to this society that enabled it to \\"see complex problems in simple...often in dangerously simple...terms, to be reasonably confident that the qualities of manliness, independence and energy by which they set such store would produce a satisfactory synthesis.\\" The influence was predominantly rural and professional, rather than urban and industrial. The propertied classes were the most powerful, and the church, the home, the estate, the court, and public offices were the dominating disciplines.<br /><br />Professor Burns explains the social theory of the day and how it was harmonized with attempts to help those who did not benefit from its workings. He studies the legal and social disciplinary forces which gave the age its cohesiveness. And he examines the thought of the leaders of the period...the statesmen, the writers, the artists, the educators, the churchmen...in relation to what they said in the years before and after this time. The Age of Equipoise is a basic work both for students of the English history and for students who seek to understand the context of thought for the literary figures of mid-Victorian society.	2004-11-28

The account was first published in 1856  when the U.S., not one hundred years old, was self consciously flexing its muscles and proclaiming itself the greatest nation in the world.<br /><br />Miss Bird admits that she came to America to dispel many of the prejudices which had been instilled in her by those travelers who had gone before her. In speaking of the \\"Yankees\\" she relates, \\"We know they are famous for smoking, spitting, \\"gouging\\", and bowie-knives...for monster hotels, steamboat explosions, railway collisions, and repudiated debts.\\"<br /><br />Miss Bird frankly likes much of what she sees. She openly admires the bustling cities with their friendly inhabitants, the miles of virgin forests, the awe-inspiring mountains, and the beautiful lakes and streams. She is dismayed and disturbed, however, by slavery, neglect of the Indian, and growing commercialism and materialism.<br /><br />This humorous and incisive book has none of the jargon usually associated with \\"travel books.\\" It is a vivid and forceful picture of a rapidly changing America...the growth of its cities, its manufacturing, its agriculture, and its educational system. The reader is given a clearly focused portrait of a  vigorous new nation attempting to reconcile Eastern sophistication with Western crudeness; Southern slave-holding attitudes with Northern abolitionism.<br /><br />Miss Bird's book is also a social commentary; wherever she travels she is interested in learning more of the attitudes and beliefs of the people she meets. Numerous anecdotes from all levels of society enliven her narrative and illustrate undeniably that she was a preceptive, unprejudiced observer.<br /><br />This trip, which took Mrs. Bishop to Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Canada, and the United States was the first of many which distinquished her as a widely renowned traveler and author.

Forster tells of the fascinating period in which she lived, from George III through the last years of Victoria's reign, and of his own boyhood. Drawn from his own recollections and from her correspondence and journals. Here are glimpses of Marianne's friends: Lord Macaulay, William Wilberforce (the abolitionist), Hannah Moore (the reformer), and Florence Nightingale (who probably went off to the Crimea because she was tired of picking up her mother's spectacles, says Marianne), but above all it is the story of Marianne herself. She was one of nine children of a prominent banker and philanthropist, who observed her times at home at Battersea Rise, near London, with the persepective of a candid, charming, and intelligent lady possessed of social conscience.<br /><br />Marianne's England was an England of stern moral rectitude...the fact that Henry Thornton married his deceased wife's sister caused a scandal in society and in Parliament (it was typical of Marianne's determined brother that he should move his family to the Continent and fight for a change in English law to make his marriage fully respectable, says she.) She never married and stayed at Battersea to preserve and protect the heritage (and worried that Napoleaon would cross the channel just to cut down her tulip tree). You can tell this book was written with love by E. M. Forster.<br /><br />16 illustrations.<br /><br />Refers to the 1956 1st edition.	2004-07-28

It said, \\"Single, ambitios, self-reliant young man required. Must be prepared to live in isolation. \\" Duncan Pryde, then an 18 year old orphan, ex-merchant seaman and disgruntled factory-worker, decided to try his hand at fur trading and immigrated to Canada. He found that he could easily adapt to the remote and primitive life there. One of his first posts was isolated Perry Island where he fought someone all night long and was accepted by the people there because of it. He witnessed the sacred Eskimo shaman ceremonies; he was paid the ultimate compliment...the invitation to share a friend's wife. His story abounds in high adventure, incredible, near fatal sled and canoe journeys; seal, polar bear and caribou hunts; breathtaking encounters with the beauty of Arctic flora and fauna.  He speaks of the native life...the Eskimoe's birth, death and marriage rites, their extraordinary tolerant sexual customs, their age-old and amazingly effective hunting skills.

The great minds...around whom the intellectual holocaust of the 19th century revolved...are at the center of this superb study, a portrait in full of the men and the era which gave birth to the theory of evolution.<br />One, Charles Darwin, was the introverted genius whose Origin of Species rocked Victorian England and revolutionized scientific theory; the other, Thomas Huxley, was the brilliant scientist, essayist, and orator who with tongue and pen subdued Darwin's critics and became his public defender.<br />Working with vast amounts of material, published and unpublished, William Irvine has skillfully combined history and biography. He shows how dissimilar they were in character...Darwin, the shy, industrious, plodding scientist who assembled enormous masses of scientific data and spent hours dissecting a barnacle with infinite patience; and Huxley, his vigorous, eloquent advocate, who with fiery tongue lashed out at such formidable foes as Bishop Wilberforce and William Gladstone to gain acceptance for scientific and Darwinian ideas.<br />With urbanity and wit, Professor Irvine describes in vivid detail the lives, both public and private, of these two men. He gives full, colorful accounts of Darwin's courtship and marrage, his orchid research, the writing of the Origin, and his final recognition and honors. There is a parallel re-creation of Huxley's family and personal life, his scientific voyage aboard the Rattlesnake, his visit to the U.S., his vigorous debates before the Metaphysical Society.<br />A masterpiece of these two great men and the era in which they lived.<br />List of illustrations:<br />Darwin and the Beagle<br />Charles and Emma Darwin in 1840<br />Darwin and Huxley in the 1850's<br />Vanity Fair's  Darwin and Huxley, 1871<br />Lyell, Wallace, Gray and Hooker<br />Darwin and the house at Downe<br />Huxley and the house at Marlborough Place<br />Huxley and the residence at Hodeslea<br />This is from 1955 edition of this book.	2004-07-09

It is at the same time a history of language, a guide to foreign  tongues and a method for learning them. It shows, through basic vocabularies, family resemblances of languages...Teutonic, Romance, Greek...helpful tricks of translation, key combinations of roots and phonetic patterns. It demonstrates that it is as easy to learn several languages at once as it is to learn one; it condenses vocabulary to a minimum of essential words; it simplifies grammar in an entirely new way, and it teaches a language as it is actually used in everyday life rather than in the abstract manner of textbooks.<br />(...)	2004-04-16
US	47257366	R3G7GXHVPNN76O	0553149083	493468394	Stones of Silence	Books	5	21	22	N	N	Contents:	The mountains of the Himalaya, from the lushly forested slopes of Nepal to the barren ranges of Central Asia, offer solitude, enlightenment, and incredible beauty, as well as the brutal reality of barren peaks and wind-torn slopes and glaciers. They are a lost world of nameless valleys, of people living in the Middle Ages, of travel by yak caravan. To field biologist George Schaller, the Himalaya is all this, and yet it is more, forming as it does the habitat of the world's greatest variety of whild sheep and goats....markhor, urial, bharal, and other spectacular animals...as well as the elusive snow leopard.<br />This is a story of high adventure, introspection, observation, and discovery. It is primarily about the Himalaya and the people and the animals that live in it. It is a story told in the words of a poet, yet seen through the eyes of a scientists, as he struggles to save this mountain world from turning to stones of silence.	2004-04-15

He cast about for a solution and found that murder seemed the only alternative. Had it not been for some entailed jewelry belonging to his stepson, a belted earl, the writer would probably have gotten away with it. But his disappearance, coinciding with that of a ruby necklace, roused the interest of Sym Gilkerson, a security management adviser (private eye).

For men it is an achievement just to stay alive on Aldabra, but for the tortoises and birds it is a paradise. It is one of the few tropical island that remain unspoiled, and was recently the object of the biggest conservation battle of all time.<br />Tony Beamish tells of a remarkable journey around the island's seventy-mile rim of honeycombed coral, so sharp and spiky that it cut his climbing boats to ribbons. He describes the unique animals and birds that dwell on the sailless and waterless atoll, such as the 80,000 giant tortoises, a population far outnumbering the 3,000 that survive in their only other refuge on the Galapagos Islands; the frigate bird with its seven-foot wingspan; and some of the rarest land birds of the world including the last flightless bird in this region once famous for the dodo.<br />He also tells of the campaign to save Aldabra, from the threatened construction of an airfield there; of how scientists and conservationists on both sides of the Atlantic, led by the Royal Society and the American Academy of Sciences, triumphantly fought for the atoll that few people had heard of before. He makes a powerful plea for the preservation of a scientific wonder that will remain in danger until the airfield plans are finally scrapped.	2004-04-12

Against staff indifference, Dr. Marks develops his own illuminating concern and love.

She can sacrifice herself, she thinks, but she can never...even in self-preservation...kill another human being. so she believed in the beginning...until the band of marauders from the city appeared...What happens when the law of the land turns into the law of the jungle, when &quot;practical&quot; considerations are irrevocably transmuted into a death sentence for millions, and a group of ordinary people meet not one but two devastating world crises..both terrifyingly possible; that is the essence of this powerful novel.	2004-04-06
US	47257366	R2HDTOKAWMCKPS	0815404646	891832100	Shelley: The Last Phase	Books	5	2	2	N	N	From inside flap:	Recent scholarship has destroyed the 19th century fiction that Shelley was an effiminate &quot;ineffectual angel&quot;. The conventional portrait remains, however, that of an erratic, idealistic boy. Ivan Roe examines a new Shelley, the mature poet of the Italian years, grouping his studies of his life and poetry round the taut drama of the last two months of Shelley's life, here given in detailed narrative for the first time in English.<br />The author brings to this period an informed and evocative tragedy, drawn from several recent travels in Italy. The background of Italian and English history, drawn largely from previously unpublished State papers, gives a new dimension to the conflicts of the poet's life. The influence of Petrach, much more powerful than was hitherto suspected, is brought out in a special study of Shelley's reading of this poet.<br />Concerning the two great mysteries of Shelley's life, the author presents a study of Julian and Maddalo with suggestions as to its possible bearing on the &quot;winter of desolation&quot; (1818-19) in the poet's second marriage; Mr. Roe also advances a fresh line of research on the identity of the poet's Neapolitan &quot;daughter&quot;, Elena Adelaide.<br />Illustrations of P.B.

Old-fashioned Detective Lou Baroni thinks so, but his flashy young partner, Steve Perry, and the head of homicide, Lieutenant Tate, have already labeled it &quot;death by misadventure&quot;.<br />Off the record Baroni begins investigating Hawley, a shy, retiring man, henpecked to the bone. He's so obviously not a murderer that Baroni begins to see his sergeant's stripes go glimmering.<br />Though his superiors order him to give up on Hawley, Baroni persists in tailing the little man, collecting as a close friend along the way a lively young actress who saw Mrs. Hawley fall. Outraged at Baroni's stubborness, Tate moves to oust him from the force only to find that Baroni's plodding thoroughness on more celebrated cases has uncovered the trail of the city's underworld kingpin and that there are more ways to a happy retirement for an old cop than this world dreams of.	2004-04-03

(English and French Edition)	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Contents:	This Prelude is generally considered the major work of the author of Waiting for God. It was written in 1943 when Simone Weil, after a brief interlude in New York returned to Europe to help in the fight for the liberation of France. The Free French authorities in London, perhaps somewhat at a loss to find employment for a woman of genius, asked her to write a report containing recommendations for the renovation of the educational and governmental system in France after the war.<br />The result was this extraordinary and revealing essay, a philosophical consideration of the whole question of man's essential needs. It is a serious work; a work requiring patience and thought from the reader, full of characteristic flashes of insight and brilliant penetration to the well springs of human conduct. In it the author seeks to set up a new conception of the citizen's duty...to himself, his fellow men, his country and God.	2004-04-01

He discusses the roots of the struggle between the U.S. and Russia. Examining the struggle in the light of the last 50 years (remember, written in 1951), he finds the problem of Russia to be but part of a greater crises we face...a crisis of Western culture.<br />Toynbee and Spengler, Freud and Jung, Henry Adams and Thomas Mann, the author shows, have all anticipated in one form or another the present crisis. He uses their viewpoints to reveal the dangerous misunderstandings and confusions on both sides of the cold war. Only by facing those difficulties, he reasons, can we reach the practical possibilities for action that still remain open to us.<br />He offers no solution or panacea. Indeed, he thinks that we have often asked ourselves the wrong questions.	2004-04-01

Through this lightening-paced account of what life inside a Mexican prison is really like, we relive with him the dramatic events leading up to his arrest and \\"trial\\" in Mexico City; his first hand confrontation with beatings, filth, rape, and extortion; his refusal to \\"cooperate\\" with prison commandos...a refusal that resulted in violent torture and a near-fatal stabbing. The engrossing narrative then takes the reader deeper and deeper inside this \\"inescapable\\" prison and its politics as Dwight describes the behind-the-scenes events Americans never hear of: a U.S. Embassy spokesman on the take from a Mexican lawyer; a corrupt network of U.S. trained narcotics agents with lucrative \\"connections\\" of their own; and a group of some 500 American prisoners, many of whom epitomize the plight of the stoned generation..passive, dependent, inarticulate, and in Dwight's words, \\"doped to the eyelids\\".  Barbara, in alternating chapters explains how they met, their courtship, their plans for marriage and for freedom.	2004-04-01

Yet few women have more claims to fame than this Restoration playwright and novelist who, after acting as a spy in the Dutch wars, became the first professional authoress and a pioneer in female emancipation; whose play The Rover, apart from her political plays written in support of the Tories, set her in the front rank of dramatists; whose novel Oroonoko was the first book to portray the horrors of slavery; and who, though her works might reflect the general coarseness of the period, could write a perfect lyric. This book vividly describes her many-sided activities, her character and the circles in which she moved, and examines several hitherto unknown facts based on recent research. Write up refers to hardback, 1948 edition.	2004-03-31

The name plaque on the corner of her desk said &quot;V. Norton&quot;. She was blond and beautiful and cold.<br />Especially cold, at least at the beginning, to John Addis, who was in lowly research and who was short and didn't seem very glamorous.<br />Of course, Miss Norton couldn't have known about John's devoted aunt, Mrs. Acantha Morgan, or that John's cousin Bertie was Herbert Hammond, chairman and managing director of Hammond and Morgan.<br />In spite of what she didn't know, and perhaps because of what John did know, Miss Norton found herself asking him to go to work for her as a bodyguard and a chauffeur. She was involved in an interesting enterprise. It included having John driver her around in a Bentley while she moved ahead with her plans.<br />John chauffeured her and eventually changed everyone's plans...even in the face of undercover, between the sheets, and across the continent activities, not all of them absolutely honest.<br />This is a delicious, exciting, and charmingly sophisticated book which should enchant a host of readers.	2004-03-29

This gift, given of God, is shared with the world in these nearly 500 graphic illustrations that cover some 130 commonly used subjects: Christian growth, faith and works, incarnation, marriage, promises, separation, trust, worship. There is an index in back. 379 pages.<br />Example: Meekness...<br />What is meekness?  Many people have a totally wrong idea of it, but they can learn the true meaning by listening to jockey's and horse-trainers after a horse race. The horse that wins the race is &quot;the meekest on the track.&quot; This is the horse most under control, the horse that responds most quickly to the jockey's guidance. The self-willed horse, the factious horse, is frequently left at the post; when he does get started he may run faster than some of the others, but he does not finish with the leaders who were meek. In the Word of God, meekness is presented to us as a vertical virtue, not as a horizontal one. Meekness is the way a man stands before God...even as Moses was able to stand before Pharoah...he is bolder than any man. &quot;The meek shall inherit the earth.&quot;<br />Dr. Barnhouse was the pastor at the Tenth Presbyterian Church in Philadelphia, PA  and was the founder of The Evangelical Foundation and for many years the radio voice of the Bible Study.

Henry Miller's works could come into his native land only in the hands of smugglers.<br />The End of Obscenity describes the exciting trials of Lady Chatterly, Tropic of Cancer, and Fanny Hill, leading all the way to the Supreme Court, which cleared the way for their publication in this country. Charles Rembar's analysis of the legal background and strategy of each case is insightful and lucid. And the excerpts from the trial transcripts are often gripping, especially the excerpts from the expert witnesses who were called by the defense: Malcolm Cowley (who, in speaking of Lady Chatterley's Lover, said to a not particularly literary-minded examiner, &quot;Sir, I will have to explain that the whole book is directed toward what doesn't happen in the book&quot;) and his fellow critics Eric Bentley, Alfred Kazin, and many others, joined by such political figures as Senator Edward Brooke, judges, postmasters and the writers themselves.<br />Rembar's book deals not with the why of obscenity laws but with the how, and as a result often has a freshness that little recent writing on this subject can match.	2004-03-20

But the real trial was taking place in the mind of Ben Waddell, the black attorney assigned to prosecute the case. Wasn't Peel acting out the rage that Waddell himself knew only too well? Didn't the two men have similar backgrounds and goals, as Peel's white lawyer insisted? What had brought them to this strange confrontation?<br />This novel follows Waddell's search for answers: from a childhood scarred by racism in the Deep South to a new beginning in California; from bitter experiences in a newly -integrated Air Force to a Korean prisoner-of-war camp; to a career in law, and finally, to this case, which tests his faith in his profession, in his people, in his wife...and in himself.	2004-03-18

It is superbly written adventure fiction, but much more, adventure extended beyond reality into the mind and soul of a man.<br />Donald Webb is an American consul stationed in the main port city of a Central American country. He has resigned himself, not unhappily, to a life of compromise and safety, until the day he receives a report from deep in the mountain jungle, a peculiarly incomplete report of the death of an obscure American painter whom he remembers from a brief and strange encounter. The report and the memory draw Webb into the jungle to find out the truth, leading him eventually to the base of a steep and forbidding mountain. He is told by the camp there that he must climb to the top. It is during the climb that Webb finds his life on a new dangerous point of balance...an experience that leads him deep into himself farn beyond the safeguards of civilzation.<br />Accompanying Webb is a jungle priest, Padre Paolo...a man of profound and, to Webb at times, irritating faith. Also to Webb's quest are certain inhabitants of the mining camp....the remarkably intelligent opponent of faith, Con Hernandez; Barrie, the vicious mining engineer; and Barrie's daughter, Mona. Brooding over all of Webb's experience stands the artist, Crispian, who once named Webb the Thirteenth Apostle: &quot;He who is called but not chosen.&quot;	2004-03-18

The stunned colonists of the island of Borneo have only once chance to escape...to reach the sea and hope a friendly passing vessel picks them up. For the fifty-odd survivors of the trek across the mountains, their savior appears in the form of an atheist midget who is Captain Krasser of the Henny, a WWI salvage vessel. Captain Krasser agrees to take the starving people on board on one condition: that the clergymen and nuns amongst them swear an oath forsaking their beliefs and admitting hypocrisy. Only Sister Ursula refuses and despite her critical condition is banned to the foredeck, isolated and ignored. The deathbed oath that Sister Ursula finally swears to Captain Krasser and the promise she elicits in return are the prime concerns of this riveting novel.

In this first major biography, Mary emerges as a striking personality in her own right, exhibiting as much Tudor obstinacy and ruthlessness within her orbit as her brother did in his.<br />Mary's long betrothal to Prince Charles, of Castile was terminated by Henry VIII, who, betrayed by Spain and the Pope in a war to check France, retaliated by making a separate peace treaty with France in which Mary's marriage to the aged Louis XII was stipulated. When Louis died less than three months after the wedding, Mary, fearing that her brother or Francis I would force her into another political marriage, persuaded Charles Brandon, Henry's life long friend to marry her secretly. After finally obtaining Henry's forgiveness, the couple returned to England, where Mary lived until her death in 1533.<br />Mary's life is an engrossing story, and Professor Richardson places it dramatically against a background of momentous historical change. His account is based on numerous contemporary documents and reflects his broad and sympathetic knowledge of early Tudor England and Renaissance politics. Especially fascinating is the picture that emerges of Henry VIII and his advisor, Cardinal Wolsey, who with increasing finesse and cunning, planned marriage alliances to further English ambitionjs, pitting themselves against such masters of diplomatic intrigue as Louis XII and Francis I of France; Maximilian, the Holy Roman Emperor; and his daughter, Margaret of Austria.	2004-03-12
