In this story Khan is building a shadow kingdom and is bent on world conquest. His biggest obstacle is Gray Seven and and his other super being sibilings.<br />You see how Khan wants the world to be a better place but naturally in his own image. He will do whatever is necessary but in the end things go wrong.<br />We see some cameos of various people from the Trek world. People that appeared from TOS to Voyager. During this story we also have a side story where Kirk is trying to figure out if the Federation should accept a new world that is involved in making humans superior.<br />Overall a great story and I enjoy how Cox gets current events that happen in the 1990's and make it part of the story. I can't wait for his 3rd story in this Khan adventure.	2002-05-27

They fascinate me. My favorite part of history is World War 2. But all I have read before is the military history not the social history.<br />Well this book really delivers in that Tom Brokaw way of reporting. He covers all types of people of that generation and the stories they have to tell are pretty amazing.<br />These were simple people that expected nothing. They had to grow up in a hurry and handle responsibilities beyond their years.<br />One theme in the book is if the next Generation can handle the challenge. Specifically the Generation X people. It is ironic that now this generation is dealing with its own Pearl Harbor and now its own war.<br />I recommned highly everyone to read this book to have an understanding of the older generation of this country. We owe these people a lot.	2002-05-27

Simeon has to return to his world and has to participate in a race with other of his kind. In this race if you win you get to fertilize the eggs and continue your family line.<br />Simeon has to have some people with him in this race and he picks his Stargazer friends. His family members hav died off and only one remain so this is why he has to pick offworlders.<br />While this is going on Wu has to rescue a ship and decide if she wants to stay on board or become 1st office of her old ship.<br />If this was not enough we hav good old politics going on back at Fleet headquarters. This is a continuation from the first book where there is this admiral determine to mess up Jean-Luc.<br />The story also has some interesting cameos from people such as the Hansens (Seven's relatives), Rachel Garrett and a new crew member someone with the last name of Paris. The series is off to a good start and I can't wait for more.<br />The only flaws I saw was a printing mistake that merged some stories together without a break between them. I also saw that Picard's first officer referred as human which I believe he is not. But those errors are very minor and not important to the story.	2002-05-27

Once I heard about a series on the Stargazer I knew it would be good. It turned out to be even better.<br />In this story we are at the beginning of Jean-Luc's career as a Captain. You can see how he is not being accepted since he is the youngest captain at 28. He has a good crew but some also feel a little out of place. To make matters worse he is frce to hunt a tough pirate that have eluded some of Starfleet's best.<br />The story has plenty of twist and turns but the best thing this book has is the character development from the Captain down to the lowest ensign. You will actually care how these guys will do. In the end, you see Jean-Luc grwoing up a little and you get to see the captain he will become.	2002-05-27

I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.<br />The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.<br />The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.<br />The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth.	2002-05-21

Anyone who has ever wanted to be general or military leader this book tells you what you need. The book revolves around the life of General Franks and his expereiences from Vietnam to the Gulf War.<br />It also shows how the US Army was pretty much shattered after Vietnam.... I was also surprised to learn of all the controversy involving the higher up's and with Franks.<br />The best part of the books for me was how Franks tells you detail by detail how the US Army figths and the tactics and strategies it tries to implement against the enemy. You really get into the mind set of a general in the US Army.<br />The book at times gets pretty heavy in military jargon but if you really want to learn how the military operate this is it. I strongly recommned it and definately should be required reading at any military institution.	2002-05-04

My friend gave me this book and I took a while to even open the book. Finally I decided to go for it and I was surprised. It's a quick read and has plenty of action.<br />The story centers around Blake Johnson and Jack Fox. Blake is a professional hit man for the President and Jack is a mafia guy. They will battle each other since Jack killed Blake's ex-wife. From that point on it moves very quickly and Blake meets up with his friends in England and in this tale they battle not only Jack but also Arab fanatics and the IRA.<br />My only complaint and why I gave it only 3 stars that at times things were moving way to fast. There wasn't much character development, but some reviewers have pointed out that this is a series so that explains that. I also thought it was a little unrealistic how they were able to unravel the mystery so easily but hey I wanted to have a good read not a documentary. :)<br />Overall, I did like it and plan on reading another Jack Higgins novel.	2002-05-04

You are there with Clancy, he also describes the missions and future roles of submarines. The bad part of the book in my opinion it was a little out of date. But it is a great book to learn about subs and their tactics, roles, and history.	2002-04-15

Learning about McGovern's war record was very enlighting. The book doesn't go much on his Presidentital run but his experience in war certainly help explains his political positions he will have later in life.<br />For me this is a quiet hero who did his job the best he could. Just like many people that fought WW2. The only problem I have with the book is that it is put up together a little haphazard. Other books such as Bands of Brothers we really get to know everyone really well. This book it doesn't really happen.<br />Nonetheless the McGovern story alone is worth getting this book. As always Ambrose does include great details how life was in camp and in the planes. For a history teacher (like myself) the details are crucials. It helps me explain how WW2 was fought in the sky over Europe.	2002-03-16

He does a great job showing the reader how the military work and also the political side. The Chinese at times are shown a little too one dimensional but I have no problem with that. The last 200 pages are excellent in showing the US military in operation. As my title of this review state an editor would have been nice. The book runs too long at times and sometime it is repetitive on some issue. Such as the constant fixation of the CIA agent's &quot;sausage&quot; and Russian prostitution. I also agree with some reviewers that Ryan whining as President gets tiring. But overall the book is very good but not perfect. I also have no problem reading a long book but I do like them tidy.	2002-02-25

He wrote two stories in the SCE series that was excellent. Dealing with the Defiant from TOS. You can tell from that two stories he knew his Trek well. When I heard about this novel I knew I had to get it. I wasn't disappointed. Excellent story with Kirk and Sulu doing a covert operation with Koloth from the episode Trouble with Tribbles. They have to rescue Starfleet prisoners before they are eliminated. As some have pointed out it has humor and action. The ending is pretty impressive when Kirk explains his feeling about his son's death. Very strong stuff. Once again great novel and they should have let Dayton Ward write the TOS edition of Gateway!!	2002-02-03

I did enjoy the NF and DS9 stories. The DS9 in particular for me was excellent. I thought the weakest was the Challenger story and it seemed to be the one that had the least connection with the whole Gateway story. The other stories refer to each other a little but the Challenger one nothing at all. It's a separate universe bascially. I also felt that the ending really was lacking. Basically the book like the series had it's high point and low points.	2002-01-18

They sent them to two different worlds with no spaceflight technology. Since this is a Gateway series you know they get their hands on it and attack each other. The Excaliber and Trident commanded by Calhouhn and Shelby are sent to solve the Gateway problem and the war between these races.<br />The story is very typical New Frontier style with interesting twists and attitude. I did noticed the NF gang is mellowing and growing up more except for the engineering crew with that Fetus joke. Thatcould have been cut down a little. Overall I thought the story was great and to me the best of the series tied with the TNG story. The series started so-so, dropped to pretty bad in the 2nd but from that point on was good to excellent.	2002-01-13

This one beats out the previous one but not by much. It contiues the Gateway series obviously but also continue the story from the Avatar books and from the Section 31 edition. The story is excellent and the characters very interesting. To me it had some nice surprises and they continue to show more of Vaughn and Shar's trouble. You also have a good tale about Quark and Kira with the JemHadar guy. Overall great book hopefully the next two are also good.	2002-01-04

The few Voyager novels that I have read though have been superior to the TV series. This is one of those novels. The author captures what was really the best qualities of the series and the characters. Here all the characters have something to do not like the TV series where it became the 7 of 9 show. Nothing wrong with that but variety would have been nice. Here we get to see Janeway as a strong leader. Not someone that sometime became irrational as shown on the show at times. Janeway and Chakotay have a strong bond here which I approve but differed from the series finale. This is more appropriate and logical not the crazy pairing they did at the end. I also liked the fact the author show us all these different alien species and some of the older ones of the TV series. The book has good action and has some cute, light moments. It is not perfect but the Gateway series has definately picked up from book 2 and has done well after that. Hopefully book 6 will be good too.	2002-01-04

I thought there was a good 100 pages there they could have cut out. The part where they are on the grave ship was a little repetitive and the way Carey constantantly reminds us that Nick Keller is the &quot;cowboy&quot; in this sector could have been cut down. I found most of the characters interesting such as the first officer. The Zoa character to me was totally unrealisitc, on any other ship she would have been long gone.<br />Another aspect that was annoying was the characters acted at times people from this era and not people from the future. Specifically the way they speak, the lingo they use is straight from the 20th century. A little is o.k. but not constantly. Not even the people from the TV series Enterprise act like this even though they are much closer to us in time.<br />Many people have stated it and needs repeating there are moments that the novel achieves clarity and that is when it is at it's best. the cliffhanger in particular is very good better than the one in book one in my opinion. The sad part of this book is there is a good story in there dying to come out but better editing might have helped.	2002-01-03

But book 4 is turning out to be just as good and maybe even better. I have to finish to be sure. Book one and especially two were major disappointments. Two was confusing!!! I know most people haven't rated this book well but the story was to me a lot easier to follow compared to book 2 and the characters much more realistic to the Star Trek universe.<br />There are many references to past episodes even to other Trek books that blend in wonderfully. The story helps advance major story lines that belong to other series too. I also enjoyed the many species that are involved and for me well written. It was great to read this book and reminded me why I like TNG so much.	2002-01-03

I was a little disappointed with the book. Like some people have pointed out it had little action. At the end I got plenty interested but then it leaves you hanging. The characters for me were pretty accurate, (Kirk, Spock, Scotty, etc.) but the Petraw really didn't intrigued me that much since there was so little about them and pretty similar except for one major character. The book is pretty much an introduction into the series. Hopefully the other five books have more action and the 7th one should tie everything together.	2001-12-22

If you are interested in how our guys fought in WW2 this is it. Naturally the book concentrates at the company level but it offers insights really how the entire division was really special. Initially you I worried that since they are so many guys mention you won't keep track but Ambrose does a good job not to get you too lost. The hero are many in this book but the story of Major Winters is incredible. A real American hero. If you are someone that enjoy reading about world war 2 this is the book I recommend to get your hands on.	2001-12-03

You also get stories involving with Si Cwan and a new empire he might lead with Calhoun's old enemies the Danteri. The cliffhanger is excellent and unexpected at least for me.

It includes his father and grandfather life highlights as well. I will be honest I consider myself pretty good in history and a World War 2 buff and never knew anything about McCain's grandfather. A very interesting character, I would love just to read a book just on that guy alone. Like many people have mentioned here to understand John McCain you really need to know about his dad and granddad. His naval career before Vietnam for me is pretty shocking. You always see movies on crazy naval pilots but I figured they were overblown. McCain shows that the stereotype is not too far off. His experience in Vietnam and how he survived is simply put incredible. Even though he suffered less than others according to him, his heroism is still remarkable. I enjoyed the book and greatly admired the man and to the people that fought in Vietnam. I plan to read certain segments to my classroom especially the chapter on the Washrag.	2001-09-03

It's 800 plus pages in the hardcover version. Anyway like some reviewers have said here you need to read the other books if you want to be clear on everything that is going on in this book. The story was good typical Clancy stuff and I consider myself a fan. The negatives for this novel is that this could have been cut down at least 200 pages. Takes too long to get going but once everything is in place then the story takes off. The only other negative is that there is a story of some Mountain Men and for me it was a waste could have been cut altogether and the novel would have been fine. One final thing, the politics that President Ryan has is a little simliar to Bush, for some people that might be great and while for others it might be a little spooky. :)	2001-07-29

As many reviewers here have mentioned it more than that. It's about the dangers of genetics and cloning that we are about to do ourselves. Cox doesn't beat you over the head on the dangers, but he gives some graphic scenes what will happen. The story is really interesting especially the way Cox connects historical events with Star trek events. He is definately going to have his work cut out in the 2nd book. That will deal exclusively with the 1990's. I also like how Cox shows us where Khan grows up and why he has so much anger and desire to rule the world. I also enjoyed how he has portrayed gary 7 and Ms. Lincoln as sorta of like The Avengers. The B story is our guys Kirk and Company from the 1st 5 years mission heading to a planet made up of these &quot;supermen&quot;. The Klingons want their technology and the Federation doesn't want this non-memeber world to fall in the wrong hands. The main story is being read by Kirk as historical documents. That story also has an interesting cliff hanger. The B story is only 3 chapters I believe the rest is Khan. My only problem with the book that it tends to excessively mention things of that period. Cultural things. I guess since I am a history teacher I am well aware of the things he mention!! But that is a minor thing. I think the 2nd book will be even better.	2001-07-21

An organization that is ruthless as the other alien groups they have encountered made sense to me. Even though the Federation is idealistic you have to have some folks that are realist. Anyway bought all four books and this one was my second favorite in the series. The first one for me was Abyss. Anyway it was interesting to see Kirk and company take on Section 31 since we saw this in DS9 a couple of times. The story is about these scientist trying to create this molecule that will give off unlimited energy or something to that effect. The only bad thing about it is if you screw up (highly unstable) the entire quadrant practically will be screwed in warping around. Space travel will be impractical and that would be bad! :) These scientist though are being manipulate by Section 31 operatives and according to the novel she is good looking and falls for Kirk. They naturally stumble onto to this when they are investigating a starship that its whole crew is dead. The novel connects incidents from &quot;The Enterprise Incident&quot; in TOS, Admiral Cartwright in ST VI, and the episode in Voyager dealing with the Omega Molecule, the story when McCoy got the fatal disease and how he reacted and finally how section 31 got its name and mandate. If you saw that episode you know how this will end. The story is good the characters right on.	2001-07-01

This is also the first book I believe that follows the events that happen in the Avatar DS9 season 8 opener. The story deals mostly with Bashir naturally and also the new character from Avatar the JemHadar soldier that Odo has sent. The story will also connect with the SCE series when they bring in some needed parts for the station. One of the reason I enjoyed this story so much is that we learn a lot about the new JemHadar soldier and we get to see Bashir take charge once again just like in the series that dealt with Section 31. My only complaint is that we didn't see enough of a new character introduced in Avatar which is Commander Vaughn. I like him a lot he is a true old guard StarFleet dude. There is also a revelation about him in this novel that will catch maybe some folks offguard. We also get to learn more stuff about Ro missing years and see the further development of Erzi Dax. The villian is so-so pretty evil but nothing spectacular really. I recommend the book to everyone.	2001-07-01

The high point for me was Abyss. That was the best. The worst of the bunch was Shadow. Rogue is not the best but not the worst. It's a good read. I know some people have mentioned the homosexuality aspect but I could care less. To me it was just two people loving each other and nothing tacky or overt. Typical Trek stuff really. No big time sex scene. The story was good I thought but I agree with some of the people here that Section 31 comes of kinda of dumb. I was hoping they would shaft the Tal Shiar in the end. They didn't really. I think that is what people like about section 31 how they want one thing but are really doing something else. Also the fact they sacrifice two solar systems for a ... list didn't impress too much. Something more valuable would have done it or as I mention it was a ruse for something else. That section 31 introduced the disease that the Chairman of the TalShiar will get in the DS9 series. But overall I liked it and was not bad.	2001-07-01

But unfortunately I thought of all the Section 31 books this was the weakest. They have 3 stories going on throughout the novel. I think it would have been better if they had combined the Emperor story with the mother trying to help her daughter out story. The plot to kill 7 of 9 is alright but nothing spectacular. What I found kinda of funny and interesting were the logs left behind by the would be killer. The way she bashes Janeway reminds me a lot of the BBS in TrekNation. They have lots of fans that hate Voyager. It seems like they wrote that part of the novel. I would have enjoyed more of an active role for section 31 in this novel. Also Chakotay and Paris are left with almost nothing to say in this novel which is a shame. I enjoy the Paris character a lot but here he is told to shut up a lot. Also the Doctor doesn't have much to say either. He is another good character. Anyway those are the reasons why the novel fails for me.	2001-07-01
