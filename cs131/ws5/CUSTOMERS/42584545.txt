US	42584545	R20LGZB0V6N1UX	1570915474	748784638	The Harmonica	Books	5	18	18	N	N	Music in the Darkest Hours	Sometimes a book falls into your hands that you know will carve a road through your heart before you open it.  In this case, from the cover illustration and title, I knew that Tony Johnston's picture book; THE HARMONICA would be such a read.  Inspired by the true story of Henryk Rosmaryn, this picture book takes readers on a journey through the nightmare of the Holocaust.<br /><br />The story itself is poignant, painful and full of the hope that human beings find in the worst of times.  Our narrator is a young boy with the gift of music who lives in Poland.  Despite their poverty, his father acquires a harmonica for him.  But this joyous time is short lived when the Nazi's arrive, tearing his parents away and sending him off to live in a concentration camp.  A commandant hears him playing Schubert on the harmonica one night and demands the boy to play for him every night in exchange for bread.  Ultimately, the boy finds strength through his playing and realizes it is a way to give his fellow prisoners hope in the darkness.  There are, of course, many books on this subject-many good books.  I think I can safely say this joins their ranks.  Ms. Johnston's simple, lyrical text is both poetic and harsh in its narration.  That is evident from the opening lines \\"I cannot remember my father's face, or my mother's, but I remember their love, warm and enfolding as a song.\\"  The text never falters, and never becomes overwrought.  With a large font, and only a few lines per page, the story unfolds more like a poem than a straight narrative.<br /><br />This is illustrator Ron Mazellan's first children's book, and it is a stunning achievement.  With a mixture of art mediums, the images come to life in rich color and texture.  Characters are drawn in high detail while the backgrounds are more sparse and indistinct giving the entire story a slightly dream-like quality, which goes well with Johnston's lyrical text.  In the earlier, happier pictures, the images are a wash of warm golds and browns.  As the Nazi's encroach up on the picture, the washes turn to grays, and purples and blues.  And then the warmth begins the come back in as he remembers his family and embraces the music.  So much of the story is conveyed by the emotion in these pictures, that a reader can take a long time studying a single image before turning the page. At the very back of the book, there is a note that this book was inspired by the true story of Henryk Rosmaryn who survived the hardships of the concentration camps and made his way to the United States, where he continued to play his harmonica to inspire others.<br /><br />This is not a story for a young child.  Picture books are not always for beginning readers or toddlers, this story is not happy, and while there is a positive message within the music, there is no satisfactory conclusion for a youngster.  There is no happy reunion for the boy and his family; there is no come-uppence for the violent commandant.  The book does not offer resolutions or reassurance.  For a child who is learning about the Holocaust, however, this may be one of the books to introduce them to.  It has a young narrator for them to identify with and some powerful messages to share.  And while it is dark and grim, the book is not grisly.  Everything is shown through the eyes of the main narrator.  Be prepared to spend some time discussing this book and the events that inspired it.  This is a beautiful and powerful book, but it does have an appropriate time and place for a child to discover it.<br /><br />For those who love THE HARMONICA, I would recommend the picture books ONE YELLOW DAFFODIL by  David A. Adler and THE SECRET SEDER by Doreen Rappaport.<br /><br />Good Reading! Shanshad ^_^warm golds and browns.

And the anniversary of Koom Valley is approaching-the ancient battle between Trolls and Dwarves that has been repeated and remembered ever since, creating enmity between the two races.  Tensions are high, especially in the city of Ankh-Morpork, where both races live in increasing numbers.  As if this wasn't enough for the Commander of the City Watch to deal with, he's got a dwarf murder to solve, a new recruit who is also a vampire and a city Inspector to deal with-and, in true Pratchett fashion, nothing is quite what it seems on the surface.<br /><br />The Discworld has always included dwarves and trolls as part of its inhabitants, yet in some of the earlier Discworld books, one would hardly recognize those races as they appear in the most recent city watch books.  The City Watch books, particularly, MEN AT ARMS, FEET OF CLAY and THE FIFTH ELEPHANT have led readers away from the simple stereotypes Pratchett set down in the earliest books.  These Discworld stories have added depth, understanding and complexity to these two races.  THUD! takes that exploration and understanding even further by looking at the history of Koom Valley with new eyes, and a new Discworld novel.  Of course, Pratchett never just tells a story, as any veteran readers will know.  Pratchett is as much a writer of satire, an observer of the human condition around him.  And the stories he writes have many echoes in the world around us.  THUD! creates echoes many readers will recognize: ancient enmities, racial intolerance, old battles revisited, and the desire of a father to spend time with his son.<br /><br />I haven't met a Discworld book that I don't like.  Pratchett is one of the rare authors I've come across who is consistently a good read.  I can't give this book less than 5 stars.  That being said, this book was not Pratchett's absolute best.  There was some sense that the opening chapters were a bit less streamlined, too much going on.  But my biggest issue was with the character of Sally, the vampire.  Pratchett spends less time on her than he usually does on setting up a new character.  The kind of care he spent introducing previous Watch characters, such as Angua and Cheery just isn't as evident here.  While the vampire girl is a part of the plot, her own story doesn't become realized here, and the conflict between Angua and Sally seems to be only touched on, rather than really explored.  This is also not the best book for a new reader to cut their Discworld teeth on.  Many of the established characters are only given a cameo appearance before we move on to the real story.<br /><br />That said, the \\"real story\\" is very good indeed.  The payoff is worth it.  And like any Discworld novel, I can't really go into the inner workings of the story itself without revealing too much.  You're just going to have to read it for yourselves.  If you're new to Terry Pratchett, or the Discworld series, I suggest you backtrack before reading this one and begin with GUARDS! GUARDS! the first book that features the city Watch.  While these books are not a full-fledged series and can be read independently of one another, it's still helpful to have a sense of how the characters and settings were built up in earlier stories.  If you are a devoted Pratchett fan, you already know the Discworld series, but you might want to check out WHERE'S MY COW?  the picture book that Commander Vimes reads to his son in THUD!.  I've ordered my own copy and can't wait for it to arrive. The only other downside of THUD! I know of is that it ended, and now I'm stuck waiting for Pratchett to hurry up and write something else.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadgoing on.

I read the book flap description and thought `giant rats and bats? Another quest fantasy?'.  But, being the bookworm I am, I decided to at least give it a chance.  I'm glad I did.  And yes, it is a quest fantasy, and yes there are giant rats and bats and cockroaches too.  Surprisingly, it all made for a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />Gregor, our teenage hero is an ordinary boy fallen on hard times in New York City.  His father vanished years ago and his mother works trying to make ends meet while he tries to take care of his siblings.  All this changes when Gregor follows his baby sister, Boots, when she falls through a vent in their laundry room into an underground world with giant bugs and creatures.  There are humans there too, and all of them seem to think that Gregor is the Overlander of one of their most powerful prophecies-the warrior who will unite them and bring them victory over the armies of the rats.  Gregor is more interested in finding a way home, until he discovers that fulfilling the prophecy might also mean finding his father.  But the prophecy is muddled and unclear-can Gregor survive the quest and make it home with his sister and father-or will it claim his life?<br /><br />The story presented here is fairly well tread ground, a reluctant hero from another realm, a quest that requires a gathering of several different creatures, a prophecy that is suitably ambiguous and a dangerous enemy to be overcome.  What makes it work is that the author brings the characters to life in delightful ways; the roaches, rats, bats and spiders all have their own styles and customs.  As long as the reader is willing to suspend their disbelief that such things can exist, it's a very fascinating a rousing adventure tale with a very satisfying ending.  Once the quest is set in motion, events happen very quickly, and our hero becomes the warrior he's required to be.  And the twists and turns in the prophecy make certain that this won't be an easy ending to completely figure out.  There isn't a great deal of world-building here, although there's enough to make the underground world seem real and realistic in its geography.  And while the non-human characters receive some excellent characterization, I found that some of the human characters were less well fleshed out, although Boots is very charming in her way and some of the human characters are better revealed as the story progresses.  Perhaps my greatest complaint with this story was that at the very end, a teaser is placed in the story for the sequel in a rather clumsy way.  There's suddenly the announcement of \\"oh, by the way, there's another prophecy . . .\\" as if it were pulled out of a hat and dropped into the plot.  Despite this little add on, the story itself is decent and enthralling and should keep a reader entertained until the end.<br /><br />This book is dark at times, and may be a bit scary for younger readers, but most young teen and preteen readers who enjoy quest fantasy will likely enjoy it.  Older readers may find the characters a bit too young for their interest -this is definitely not a universal read, but it works well for its age group.  Readers who enjoy this will want to go on to read GREGOR AND THE PROPHECY OF THE BANE, which is the next book in the series.  Other types of books these readers may enjoy will be THE DARK IS RISING sequence by Susan Cooper and SO YOU WANT TO BE A WIZARD by Diane Duane.<br /><br />Happy Reading!

I decided that as a children's librarian who loves picture books, I can no longer simply sit back and admire them in silence, so I'm determined to review my favorites here on Amazon and share with others the treasures I've found.  The Painter and the Wild Swans is just such a treasure, and I regret that the cover image isn't available for the book, because that would at least give readers some idea of the stunning illustrations available in this book.<br /><br />Claude Clement is a Parisian author of children's books who wrote this after she was inspired by pictures of Siberian swans.  All I can say is, it's no wonder this book received the French Foundation Grand Prize for Children's Literature.  The story is that of a skilled Japanese painter who is rich and popular.  When he catches sight of wild swans, he is enraptured by their beauty and decides he must paint them.  This pursuit of beauty becomes his obsession and ultimately, powerfully transforms him by the end of the tale.  In addition to Ms. Clement's lovely text (translated to English by Robert Levine)there is a line of Japanese poetry in calligraphy on each page of the story.  At the end, these lines are translated for the reader into Teji's (the painter of the story) Poem, recounting the entire story in poetic imagery.  That alone would have made the book worth reading.<br /><br />But then there's the art.  Acrylic paintings by Frederic Clement (no relation to the author) give the jewel of story a worthy setting.  This gifted illustrator has provided images that at once invoke the Japanese culture and style, and yet become art in their own right.  Clements marvelous technique of morphing pictures (On one page the viewer can see the swans fade into snowdrifts.  On another, a view of clouds and mountains slowly changes into an old man offering a cup of tea.  The pictures are there to savor and look over time and time again.<br /><br />There is perhaps one downside of this particular treasure, and that is the audience it is meant for.  This book probably won't work for most youngsters--it's too subtle and mature.  But adult readers may avoid it thinking that all picture books are for children only.  This is simply not true, and I'd like to convince more individuals of that fact.  The Painter and the Wild Swans really works best for ages 9 and up, in my opinion.  It's a marvelous example of a folktale styled story from Japan, and should work well in any folktale, or multicultural book collection.<br /><br />Those who enjoy the Painter and the Wild Swans may want to also look at THE BOY WHO DREW CATS: A JAPANESE FOLKTALE by Arthur Levine and MUSICIANS OF THE SUN by Gerald McDermott.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^is the audience it is meant for.

Talking yams are only the beginning of this simple and hysterically  hyperdramatic retelling of an old Ashanti tale.  When a farmer encounters a talking yam and runs and tells a fisherman, the fish talks, assuring him such a thing can't happen.  Panic and hilarity ensues in the brief text and stylized pictures.<br /><br />This is one of those folktales that can be introduced to children of any age, and lends itself especially well to read-aloud for groups of children.  Read-aloud works especially well with plenty of movement on the part of the reader, and encourages participation.  Each talking creature or object invites the children to respond with a heartfelt \\"Aiyeee!\\" as the growing number of people run on, until they reach the king, for the inevitable conclusion.  The story isn't meant to be a serious one, and the method of telling and illustrations support this humorous, almost comic strip kind of storyline.  The large text on each page is short and to the point, making it accessible to even very young children.<br /><br />The art is lovely to look at--and you can see the African styling of it.  Stefano Vitale has crafted a very vivid collection of images for this story.  However, there does seem to be some mixture of African styles, according to some professional reviews, and this may be less well received by those familiar with regional African art styles.  In my case, however, the stylized art and various elements of African imagery allow for children to get some exposure to this sort of art and style.<br /><br />As to the story itself, it appears to be an old folktale from Ghana, and an amusing one at that.  I've seen another version of this story in \\"Anansi and The Talking Melon\\" by Eric Kimmel--one of the trickster tales where the cunning spider causes havoc by making a melon seem to talk.  I'm not quite certain if these stories have the same origin, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did.  Folktales are an important part of a balanced book diet, and it's often hard to find extremely simple ones for the youngest readers and listeners.  This book is ideal on both counts.  If you enjoy this, I reccomend checking out other Trickster tales such as Raven: Trickster Tales from the Pacific Northwest by Gerald McDermott  and The Monkey and the Crocodile: I Jataka Tale from India by Paul Galdone.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshaddiet, and it's often hard to find extremely simple ones for the youngest readers and listeners.

US	42584545	R2MQRCLIHTP478	1564022455	14821430	Beware Beware	Books	3	1	1	N	N	An Cautionary Tale--Almost	Sometimes in my exploration of the shelves, I come across books that just catch my eye, like this one did. Susan Hill's BEWARE, BEWARE pulled me in with it's country gothic style artwork. So, being thus pulled in, I sat down to read the simple rhyming text.  The story unfolds, a young girl garbed in an old fashioned pinafore and her mother are safe inside on a Winter's day at sunset.  But the girl is curious as to what lurks outside.  She ventures out and into the woods, only to become frightened by the creatures she either sees or imagines before having a grateful reunion with her mother who comes looking for her. I came away from the book vaguely disturbed and disappointed.<br /><br />Ms. Hill's rhyming text is brief, with only a few words on every page.  However, the rhymes sometimes feel clumsy or forced, and I found it difficult to pick out regular rhythm that would allow me to read this book aloud (an important element for picture books in rhyme).  The text felt awkward and heavy handed in the wake of the stunning artwork and spooky ambiance of the book.  I'm aware Ms. Hill has many books published, but this is not one of her more noteworthy ventures.  I also find myself questioning the entire flow of the story itself.  The plot seems to be focused on a child's curiosity and the danger they can wander into because of it.  But there's no conclusive sense that the child has learned anything at the end, nor whether the child was in any real danger. A child this is read to may very well be puzzled why the girl was frightened at all (fabulous monsters are often more exciting than frightening) or else they may be frightened themselves by the notion of monsters in the woods right outsside there house.  There are no assurances that everything is safe or that this is imaginary.  While I don't beleive in sugar coating children's stories, I don't believe in frightening a child for the sake of atmosphere either.  On the whole, the book feels too mature, set up to be a suspensful gothic scenario turned into poetry and picture.<br /><br />The one element of this book that I do like is the artwork by Angela Barrett.  Her pencil and watercolor pictures create a marvelous sense of pattern and shadow.  This works to particularly good effect in the wood where imaginary creatures start to (literally) pop out of the woodwork.  Rich in detail and imagination, with earthy tones and the warm pink of sunset in the background, Ms. Barrett manages to capture the viewer in a way that the text does not.  She does an admirable job creating a setting for Ms. Hill's poetry, and then surpasses it quite dramatically.  I do believe I'd actually like this book better without the text altogether.<br /><br />In the end, while the art saves this book from a two-star ranking, I really can't recommend it, and especially don't recommend it for reading to young children.  There are better books out ther for addressing the curiosity and fears of youngsters.  One book you might try is THE MONSTER AT THE END OF THIS BOOK, by Jon Stone. It's one of the few books inspired by a television show I actually will recommend to parents. Also check out My Mama Says There Aren't Any: Zombies, Ghosts, Vampires, Creatures, Demons, Monsters, Fiends, Goblins or Things by Judith Viorst, and  There's a Nightmare in My Closet by Mercer Mayer.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadsuspensful gothic scenario turned into poetry and picture. <br /> <br />The one element of this book that I do like is the artwork by Angela Barrett.

Five years ago, a catastrophic virus wiped out most of the population, leaving the survivors-seven young children-to band together and find a way to survive in this new and terrifying world without adults.  Their pasts are a distant blur, their present: a constant fight for survival alone and abandoned in a dead town.  Even their names have been forgotten.  But Teacher, Mommy, Hunter and the children are about to discover that they are not alone-and they are about to embark on a dangerous quest to find the answers to what happened five years ago.  This is the first book in an exciting trilogy by Jennifer Armstrong and Nancy Butcher, the second and third volumes of the Fire-Us trilogy: The Keepers of the Flame and The Kiln finish up the story begun here.<br /><br />The premise isn't terribly unfamiliar.  Adult readers can easily see aspects of Stephen King's THE STAND, or other post-apocalyptic novels.  What is different about this book, however, is that it does not take place in a distant future, but in a time contemporary enough to feel frighteningly real.  Nor does this tale take place during the crisis, --it opens five years later when the survivors have had time to become accustomed to their life.  They are no longer the children they once were, and the roles and people they have become reflect their surroundings and the trauma they faced.  Nevertheless, they've become a family-a family whose foundations are threatened when they discover they are not alone after all.  A stranger finds them, a teen-age boy who seems half insane.  He's determined to seek out the Grown-Ups; he's convinced that some of them still live, particularly one called the President.  In time he persuades the family to leave the relative safety of their town, and take to the roads to journey to Washington.  But the way is fraught with peril and the horrors that the children faced five years ago. It is only by working together that they can hope to reach their destination.  Of course, since this is only the first book of a trilogy, there is no conclusion of their journey at the end of the first book, and readers are left with a rather huge cliffhanger.<br /><br />There's a good deal to recommend this book.  It's startlingly realistic in feel-it's easy to picture the characters surviving in the manner they do so. I enjoy survival books in general, so it's always a pleasure to read one that can explain that survival so vividly and readily, and keep it feeling fresh and interesting.  The relationships between the characters in this book, their shifting roles and personal traumas are powerful and poignant.  This is as much a book about the internal struggle of the characters as it is about the adventure.  And while this book is clearly toned to younger readers (characters are all young teens or younger, no mention of sexual themes) it never falls into sounding young or sugaring the plot with cuteness.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have found issue with the writing in this book, and I can understand their reservations.  Jennifer Armstrong has always been a profoundly poetic and lyrical writer, prone to play with language, and this book is full of her craft.  Rather than intrusive, I overall found the affect appealing and powerful, but those who are looking for a streamlined adventure story may find the writing a bit heavy handed at times.  I did have two complaints related to the writing.  The first is the sort of  \\"misheard\\" language that crops up in the beginning among the characters.  It feels a little forced at times, and the entire effect seems to fade by about the middle of the book, which was welcome, but makes its use in the opening a little inconsistent. The second concern is that the writers seem to favor a limited omniscient viewpoint, but they jump around too much, from knowing certain character's thoughts at one point, to not knowing them later on.  The effect of this was a bit jarring at times, as it did not occur with natural scene breaks or for a seemingly good reason.  My final complaint is that I have a problem with series books that don't offer a full story within one book and compound that by having a huge cliffhanger at the end of the first part of the story.  I can't rank a book as five stars that leaves me hanging and dissatisfied and readers who pick this up may want to have the other books readily available so that they don't run into this problem.<br /><br />I recommend this for 10-14 yr. olds who are looking for some serious SF stories with a strong grounding in reality.  Young adults and adults may enjoy it too, and get more out of the writing style Armstrong employs.  It's a good book for a strong reader, and I look forward to continuing the story with book 2, The Keepers of the Flame.  Those who enjoy this book may also want to look for the Obernewtyn Chronicles by Isobelle Carmody and The Giver by Lois Lowry.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadr with natural scene breaks or for a seemingly good reason.

I can't rank a book as five stars that leaves me hanging and dissatisfied and readers who pick this up may want to have the other books readily available so that they don't run into this problem. <br /> <br />I recommend this for 10-14 yr. olds who are looking for some serious SF stories with a strong grounding in reality.  Young adults and adults may enjoy it too, and get more out of the writing style Armstrong employs.  It's a good book for a strong reader, and I look forward to continuing the story with book 2, The Keepers of the Flame.

US	42584545	RAA7VNM3IHBAC	0374350159	24224484	Monsoon	Books	5	12	12	N	N	Here Comes the Rain Again . . .	Sometimes, when a picture book deals with another culture, it sacrifices story and style for explanation to it's readers about the who where and what is going on.  They can become text heavy and too pedantic for young listeners who are more interested in what happens next than a rounded education. The rarest-and the best-multicultural books don't try to explain at all, they let you discover as you read the story.  Ms. Krishnaswami's MONSOON is one such jewel of a picture book.  It tells the story of a young Indian girl waiting for the monsoon to come after all the hot, dry weather.  It shows the cycle of seasons that is necessary for living and the simple poetic beauty of the place the narrator lives.<br /><br />The theme of this story--a child impatiently waiting for a change in the weather-is a fairly common one in literature, especially picture books.  But the heart and soul of this story is India, and properly so.  It's no surprise to anyone that reads this picture book that the author grew up in India.  In the story India is not a far away or exotic place, it is home-and Ms. Krishnaswami's poetic prose paints that love of her home on every page, with every word.  The text on each page is brief, but it is text to be savored, full of rich imagery as everyone prepares for the monsoon rains.  This is clear from the very first line: \\"All summer we have worn the scent of dust . . .\\" The author does not fall back on old clich&eacute;s, but finds new metaphors to describe the town and the coming rains.  The result is description that is refreshingly vibrant and just different enough to tantalize--but not to alienate-readers. It allows me to step into another country as if I were a native, experiencing the anticipation through the young narrator as she waits, worries and hopes for the rains to come.  At the very back of the book the author has included a page of information about the monsoons and India for those who want to understand the 'what' and 'where' of the story better.  The addition of the information at the back allows the author to accomplish the goal of sharing the knowledge without allowing it to bog down the text of the story itself.<br /><br />All that, and I haven't even mentioned the pictures yet.  This is Jamel Akib's first picture book.  I, for one, hope it is only the first of many.  The artist has perfectly matched pictures to Ms. Krishnaswami's marvelous text.  Vivid colors with the soft edges give the images a slightly dreamy and comforting sense of familiarity.  Golds and warm reds and misty blues dominate the palette, making the book feel rich and sensuous.  The scenes themselves are delightfully clear portrayals of life in an Indian city, with cows wandering down the streets next to the cars, spice merchants selling their wares, a modern house with patterned rug and wall hangings.  The effect is contemporary and yet culture specific.  Like the author's text, the pictures never become so foreign as to lose the reader, evoking comfort, but including elements and details that never let the audience forget the setting.<br /><br />If you want to introduce your child to India for any reason, this is an excellent first step. The images and text provide fertile ground for sparking a child's interest and curiosity and giving parents a starting point for discussing the Indian culture in greater detail. It is one of my favorite new discoveries in the world of multicultural books and deserves a look by any picture book reader who loves the delicious feel of diving into rich art and image-rich language.  Best for children of four years and up, and for adults of all ages.<br /><br />If you enjoy this, you might want to look for THE DAY OF AHMED'S SECRET by Florence H. Parry and COME ON RAIN! by Karen Hesse.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadetter.

US	42584545	R10BV0FNBACR7R	0689850530	11153814	Alchemy	Books	3	2	2	N	N	Don't Know Much About Alchemy . . .	Margaret Mahy has a skill for weaving the supernatural and natural together, and this coming of age story fits nicely into her traditional style.  All the elements are there: Roland, the teenage boy with a hidden potential, Jess who tries to stay invisible at school while keeping wondrous secrets.  The various other players, villains and allies both affect these young adults with magic and everyday issues in their relationships.  Mahy has written many delightfully rich books that I have been reading since I was a child, and while Alchemy fits the mold of her earlier books, it doesn't quite compare to them.<br /><br />Roland is a teen who has made for himself the perfect image; he's got lots of friends, has the popular rich girlfriend and is well set to succeed in life.  So what is he doing spying on Jess Ferret, the girl in class that nobody is friends with?  And what is the secret Jess is hiding?  Finding out will change his life forever.  Roland quickly discovers that Jess is more than she seems-and that her strange research and interests are waking a part of himself that he has kept hidden for years from everyone.  But Roland isn't the only one interested in finding out about Jess, and those that want to discover her secret may have sinister motives of their own.  Roland may be Jess's only hope in thwarting the enemies that lurk in the shadows, but in order to do so, Roland must accept his own destiny and come into his own powers.<br /><br />In theory this book sounds great. Classic Mahy. In actual execution the book just can't quite find it's mark.  In some ways, it seems that Mahy is trying to create a male perspective version of The Changeover, one of her best stories.  The problem is that there really isn't enough here to make the story really work.  The pacing just doesn't work, some of the build up for Jess's secrets makes the truth of what we discover kind of lack luster.  The lack of time spent on building up the romance between Jess and Roland, just leaves me feeling their relationship is kind of stuck in the story rather than naturally evolving.  The villains are terribly one-dimensional and rather uninteresting-while I might not expect more of some writers, I know Mahy can and has done better by far.  She doesn't need to resort to the black-cape mustache-twirling sort of melodrama evinced by the villain here.<br /><br />Frankly, the themes don't play out either, the title, while relevant to Jess's interest in the subject, seems not to have much to do with the central story of the book.  Thinking about what made The Changeover work, while this does not quite, I would have to say it has to do with several things.  We never see real risk in this book-it's implied, but never quite shown.  In The Changeover, the protagonist goes through everything she does to save her little brother, who is dying.  Likewise, while Roland has a quirky single parent, they remain separate from his dealings with magic and with Jess-rather than an additional support base for Roland, his family feels more like a constant distraction. I don't find this to be one of Mahy's best efforts, and can't help but wonder if it is one of her older stories pulled out from the files and buffed up for publishing.  It's not by any means terrible-and it has plenty of Mahy's trademark treatment of the paranormal and wonderfully creative descriptions of magic that isn't so much a separate force as a part of the world.  But it's thin on plot and lazy on villain construction, so I can't give it more than three stars-particularly in comparison with something like The Changeover.<br /><br />For readers, this is definitely a young adult book. It's a little mature and with certain relationships and viewpoints that probably make it inappropriate for a good portion of the preteen audience.  If you like this book I certainly recommend you look into other Mahy titles, such as The Haunting, The Changeover and The Tricksters.  For books outside of Mahy, you may want to try some supernatural horror like Stranger with My Face, or Down a Dark Hall by Lois Duncan.<br /><br />Happy Reading!

Robert Doherty has been whisked out of his comfortable modern world and thrown into a dark and vicious wilderness where he must find a way to survive.  In veteran author Gillian Cross's newest book, she proves again why she is one of the most popular children's authors in Britain.  With deft storytelling and an atmospheric writing style, she takes a familiar plot element and transforms it into something new again. While Ms. Cross is not yet as well known in the US, I am hoping The Dark Ground can begin to change that.<br /><br />What readers will encounter here is a mix between a fantasy and a survivor story.  Robert is a teen traveling with his family by plane when something happens to him that he can't comprehend or quite remember-and he finds himself cold and naked in a dark and forbidding forest.  What happened and how aren't quite as important as staying alive-and it's only when he discovers other people living in this strange forest that he begins to consider how to get back home.  But getting back home won't be so easy-because Robert's home is both closer than he dreamed and farther away than he could have imagined.  It's going to take all his strength and bravery, along with the help of his newfound friends to undertake the expedition. The fantasy element of the book is not inherently magical.  Beyond the situation Robert finds himself in, there is no magic or magical way out of his predicament.  The characters are left to figure their own way out.<br /><br />Ms. Cross writes a riveting book, full of action, emotion and imagery that roars into the mind and sweeps the reader up into the experiences of the characters.  But Ms. Cross does not write an easy book-this is not a tale of whimsy and Harry Potter-esque characters.  Every individual is realistic, complex, sometimes unlikable and ultimately human.  The world Robert faces is unforgiving and yet remarkable-and death comes all too easily.  Ms. Cross doesn't give readers easy answers or a pat ending, nor does she tease readers by making them wait for the second volume in the trilogy to have some kind of closure to this first adventure.  This book is best for children who are ready to deal with some of the tougher issues of adventure, and can handle endings that are thought provoking if not a hundred percent \\"happy\\".  While still a young teen title, I do think both young adults and adults can enjoy this story as well.  Ms. Cross never talks down to her audience, but offers universal perspectives and emotions that almost any individual can relate to.<br /><br />Those who have read and enjoyed this book and want more survivor style fiction should check out Island of the Blue Dolphins by Scott O'Dell and Hatchet by Gary Paulsen.  Likewise, those who are fans of Science Fiction may want to look for titles such as The City of Ember by Jeanne Duprau or Obernewtyn by Isobelle Carmody.  The Dark Ground is only the first in this trilogy, I can only hope the other two books can live up to the promise of this first one.<br /><br />Happy Reading!

Your mission, fellow readers, should you choose to accept it, is as follows: don't, I repeat, don't let the pigeon drive the bus.  Oh, I know, it seems like a simple mission as these things go.  Most pigeons like to fly after all, and most of them aren't very talkative anyway.  But be warned, this is no ordinary pigeon! This unusual bird possesses all the guile and determination of a toddler angling to get a cookie before dinner.<br /><br />The formula of this book will quickly become familiar to any reader or listener: the pigeon wants to drive the bus, he NEEDS to drive the bus, and he's DRIVEN to drive the bus!!  And nasty hobbitses want to keep him from the precious bus . . . oops, wrong story. ^_^ But, you get the picture.  Your job, and your audience's job, is to say \\"No!\\" every time and for every ploy.  No matter what that pigeon says or does, you can't give him an inch.  Cuz you know he'll drive a mile!  Kids especially know this routine by heart.  After all, they're usually in the pigeon's shoes, thwarted time and time again from getting their momentary heart's desire.  This allows them to try out the other role, to see what it's like to be the authority, to set the boundaries and delightfully shout \\"No!\\" every time.  They aren't fooled for one minute by this pigeon.<br /><br />I'd really hesitate to call this book a storybook.  Because this book really isn't one in the traditional sense.  The audience does not sit quietly and wait to see what happens next.  They make it happen.  Without audience response, this book is only half a story.  All of our crafty pigeons comments are directed outward, to the audience.  He knows the reader is there and is ready to bargain with him and wear him down with his dreams of bus driving.  Likewise, the pictures are simple, unadorned and angular.  These are not misty and gorgeous pictorial masterpieces like Mary Grandpre might draw.  But another illustrator's work would not have fit the book and created the delightfully subversive book that this has turned out to be.  Like some of the best comic strips, our characters don't have to be realistic or elegant to get their point across and display a wide range of emotion and reactions.  The books convey that information readily and simply, without anything to clutter or distract the reader from those actions.  This is not art that is dressed up to the nines.  This is art that gets down to work: casual, direct and very effective at what it does.  Taken out of context, the pictures may be uninspiring and seem crude.  In context, they make the story come to life and jump off the page.<br /><br />This is a modern tale and a modern classic.  Particularly appropriate for kids in urban settings who may have never seen a barnyard or a cow, but sure as heck know what a pigeon and a bus is!  There's no fancy prose or cutesy sweetness here, instead we find wry intelligence and a subtle charm that hits home with its target audience.  If you have preschoolers I suggest you check this book out, despite your reservations.  Probably best for a preschool to kindergarten age group, since kids much older than this will be looking for more complex reads and longer stories.<br /><br />If you like this, there are more books in store in the Pigeon series, but this one-to my mind-is the best.  You might also want to check out CLICK, CLACK, MOO. COWS THAT TYPE by Doreen Cronin, or if your child is a bit older, perhaps THE STINKY CHEESE MAN AND OTHER FAIRLY STUPID TALES by John Scieszka. It's definitely worth a try with a child, and great for a whole group of kids.  Give it a read, let your children give it a listen . . .but don't, and I repeat, DON'T let the pigeon drive the bus!<br /><br />Happy reading!

US	42584545	R1RGMA4P7FSX9W	0517709260	558215267	Pockets	Books	5	1	1	N	N	A Pocketful of Wonder	Picture books come in several different types.  Some are functional and educational reads for teaching children.  Some are comical romps, spurring laughter from their audience, and some are simply, delightfully, and stunningly beautiful works of art.  This picture book written by Jennifer Armstrong and illustrated by Mary Grandpre, falls into this last category.  The title might seem a bit plain, even vague at first but it nevertheless hints at a sense of the wonderful and magical, especially given the luscious colors and images that populate these pages.  I admit that it was Mary Grandpre's cover art that first persuaded me to crack open this book, not certain what to expect, but delighted by the whimsical cover.  I was well rewarded for my curiosity.<br /><br />Like the artwork, Jennifer Armstrong's richly evocative writing weaves a tapestry to enchant readers from the first sentence.  It's a once upon a time tale, with an exotic stranger coming to stay in a plain and pragmatic farming village. But rather than start with the traditional opening, Ms. Armstrong begins with: \\"A slim schooner of a woman, driven by strong winds and a broken heart, floundered barefoot across the eastern plains . . .\\"  The author maintains her ocean/boat metaphors throughout the story, and it may at first take the reader by surprise, as the story itself takes place in a village far from the sea.  But it soon becomes apparent that this is the author's intent, to show how her protagonist differs from those around her, how she yearns for the wildness and creativity she found there.  Our protagonist is a seamstress, capable of creating marvelous garments with rich adornment. But the farmers want only plain, drab work clothes for their plain lives, and the young woman must live and dress as they do if she is to live among them.  While she agrees to their terms, she chafes at this limitation and lack of imagination.  Until she realizes she can create the gorgeous works she wishes . . . as long as they are on the insides of her pockets.  You'll have to read the book to grasp the full effect, but as she provides these pockets full of her creativity to the villagers, it gradually transforms the drab and practical town into a joyous and colorful one.  The heroine is the catalyst that changes those she encounters before moving on.<br /><br /> I will freely admit that even the adult reader may find the vocabulary of Armstrong's fanciful lists to be a challenge.  \\" . . . frocks and pantaloons of bandle linen; also doublets farthingales, damask mantuas . . .\\" Fortunately, the lists don't really get in the way of comprehending the story, they merely add to the delicious nature of the tale with these marvelously exotic words.  It is not a simple story for a child to read, however, and young readers who struggle with words will probably find this much too daunting! Even a parent may find it a bit difficult to read aloud parts of this without reviewing it a time or two first.  That said, it is a delightful story with lovely lyrical text that is meant to be savored and that seems to trip off the tongue and dazzle with its own special magic.<br /><br />Mary Grandpre's work partners with the text to make a book that is as artistic as it is poetic.  Her warm and fanciful pictures are full of the magic and whimsy that the heroine sews into her pockets.  With rich colors and swirling shapes, Ms. Grandpre truly captures the theme of the story and demonstrates the light and fire of creativity spilling from those pockets like hidden treasure.  It is clear that this team of author and illustrator meld together seamlessly, crafting some rare and beautiful books for readers to discover.<br /><br />This is a picture book that may be enjoyed by adults as well as children, showing what picture books can accomplish with their artistry and magic.  While the very young can find the story too long and the text too mature, older children may find it fueling their own imagination.  If you like this book, also check out CHIN YU MIN AND THE GINGER CAT, which also features Armstrong and Grandpre.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^  Shanshadtion.

US	42584545	R34UX6LWRG1830	0060268018	274930565	Vampires: A Collection of Original Stories	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Vampire Bites	Looking for a vampire anthology you can sink your teeth into?  Editors Jane Yolen and Martin H. Greenberg have teamed up to deliver a collection of young teen stories that feature bloodsuckers of all types and time streams.  If you're a vampire fan or just a fan of short stories in general, you might want to check this one out.  While geared for the young-teen market, the quality and variety should be enough to appeal to even adult fans of the vampire genre.<br /><br />Vampires are a subject matter that has captured many imaginations over the years.  Buffy the Vampire Slayer is only one of the latest of this theme.  Veteran author Jane Yolen launches off this collection with a brief introduction into the worldwide legends about vampires, giving readers a window into why she has brought together this collection for our reading enjoyment.  A scan through of the names in this anthology will reveal some familiar authors: Charles de Lint, Esther M. Friesner,  Josepha Sherman, Lawrence Watt-Evans and Jane Yolen herself are a few of the most notable in 13 story collection.  Other than having young protagonists and including the theme of vampires, the tone, setting and type of story vary widely.<br /><br />The book opens with the very brief \\"Nobody has to Know\\" by James D. MacDonald and Debra Doyle.  The story is told entirely in dialog, and is delightful introduction to the rest of the book.  De Lint's \\"There's No Such Thing\\" takes place in modern day-a touching story about the bond between sisters, and the real predators that lurk in the world. Not De Lint's best work, but a pleasant read.  \\"Curse of the Undead\\" by Chuck Rothman is a hysterical look at what happens when our young hero comes back as one of the \\"undead\\" and finds things don't work at all like they do in the stories.  On a more gothic note is \\"Blood Kin\\" by Delia Sherman, a dark and spine tingling story of a young orphan who is taken in by some very frightening cousins.  It's a bit long at times, but very atmospheric, and nice touch for this anthology.  \\"Miss Emily's Roses\\" by Mary Frances Zambreno was my least favorite of the collection, being a vaguely dark story about the bond between two sisters.  From that story, we go onto Esther Friesner's \\"The Blood-Ghoul of Scarsdale\\" which is a first person account of our heroines encounter with a young vampire at the mall-like, really.  While the style of speech gets a bit overblown valley girl at times, and makes the story a bit dated, it's still pretty funny.<br /><br />\\"The Magic-Stealer\\" by Josepha Sherman, would be at home in just about any fantasy story anthology as it weaves a coming of age story in a small village where a young girl must come to grips with her own power to defeat the evil that threatens her.  Mary K. Whittington tells the tale of our protagonist facing a very young vampire in \\"Ahvel\\".  It's a charmingly story that nevertheless has quite a chill to it.  Probably the most unusual story in this collection is Phyllis Ann Karr's \\"A Cold Stake\\", which opens in a future where there is a curious relationship between the real and the imagined.  Karr's story focuses more on the relationship between the young people in the book than on the actual vampirism.  \\"Blood Libel\\" by Leigh Ann Hussey is one of my favorites of this collection.  This is a powerful story of a Jewish vampire who strives to retain his humanity and his faith, in the face of his new nature.  Beautiful and poignant.  \\"Aunt Horrible's Last Visit\\" by Jeff Hecht is a spooky story about a very nasty relative coming for a visit, and how she's thwarted.  My hands-down favorite in the collection is Jane Yolen's bittersweet  \\"Mama Gone\\" which is a beautifully chilling first person narrative from the young heroine who must find a way to defeat evil with her own courage and love.  It still manages to bring tears to my eyes to read it.  The anthology closes with \\"Richie\\" by Lawrence Watt-Evans-a bittersweet look at a modern vampire looking for love, and what that means for him.<br /><br />There's no story in this anthology that is without some merit, and most of them are great reading.  Even though this collection is over ten years old, it still has the same power and impact it had when first published.  This is a perfect volume for reading about vampires in small doses-excellent for a young teen reader just discovering horror and speculative fiction.  If you enjoy this and are looking for more vampire fiction, be sure to check out THE SILVER KISS by Annette Curtis Klause and COMPANIONS OF THE NIGHT by Vivian Vande Velde.  If you are interested in other speculative fiction anthologies,  2041 edited by Jane Yolen is also an excellent collection of stories for young teens.<br /><br />Curl up with this book for some thrills and chuckles, but be sure to bring a sharpened stake and plenty of garlic!<br /><br />Happy Reading ^_^ Shanshadfor love, and what that means for him. <br /> <br />There's no story in this anthology that is without some merit, and most of them are great reading.

Fifteen-year-old Ruth is a member of Ark Three, and can't seem to fit in or do anything right.  Can this misfit find her place in the community?  Monica Hughes is an accomplished author of Science Fiction for young readers, and knows her craft.  This book is the sequel to DEVIL ON MY BACK, although the stories can be read independently of one another.  Ms. Hughes sparks the imagination, creates compelling characters and leads readers on an adventure, not only in science fiction, but also of the heart.<br /><br />The basic situation that underlies this story will be familiar enough.  Ruth is the only one of her fifteen-year-old group that is strikingly different.  She can't seem to do anything right, can't seem to fit in, can't seem to be happy.  She keeps wondering what's wrong with her.  Pretty much, this theme is a tenet of teen fiction, and Ms. Hughes knows this.  But here's where the story changes: Ruth is part of a self-sufficient community that has developed psychic powers and links as part of their survival.  At age fifteen, each child becomes an adult, joining the Web-the perfect pattern formed by the joining of minds of everyone in Ark Three.  And every fifteen-year-old is given a vocation based on his or her talent.  But Ruth has no talent; it seems, except for causing trouble, disrupting the web and generally being unhappy.  But the fact is, Ruth does have a talent-a rare one.  And it is her abilities that allow her to receive dreams that are being sent from another Ark.  She will help spur her community into an exciting and dangerous journey through the outside to try and find this other Ark.  But what they find may be the most dangerous thing of all . . . and it will take all of Ruth's abilities, along with those of her friends and new allies, to survive it and create a new future for all.<br /><br />As with all of Ms. Hughes books, the author not only deftly threads the themes that are universal to youngsters and teens everywhere, but also maintains a social conscience about the kind of societies that are possible in this future.  She looks at them critically, demonstrating their flaws, and their strengths, and proving that sometimes the most unlikely people can be the catalyst that changes society for the better.  Ms. Hughes doesn't pull her punches when it comes to her characters; they wind up in real danger, and have to survive some true ordeals.  But everything is coached in young reader terms, so older readers may find some of the events less sophisticated than they would like-this is not an adult reader's story and doesn't try to be.  If your young teen reader is hungry for science fiction stories, and not quite ready to tackle the likes of 1984 or BRAVE NEW WORLD, then this kind of book is the perfect stepping-stone.<br /><br />If you like this book, please be sure to check out DEVIL ON MY BACK, which this is a stand-alone sequel to.  Also check out other books by Hughes like INVITATION TO THE GAME and KEEPER OF THE ISIS LIGHT.  If you enjoy these sort of stories set in a post apocalyptic future, also check out THE CITY OF EMBER by Jeanette Duprau, OBERNEWTYN by Isobelle Carmody and THE GIVER by Lois Lowery.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadth's abilities, along with those of her friends and new allies, to survive it and create a new future for all. <br /> <br />As with all of Ms. Hughes books, the author not only deftly threads the themes that are universal to youngsters and teens everywhere, but also maintains a social conscience about the kind of societies that are possible in this future.

US	42584545	R1W36WBPLLZOE2	0440218985	635199308	2041-12 Stories About the Future	Books	4	10	10	N	N	In the Year 2525 . . . Well, Okay, the Year 2041	Published in 1991, this collection of stories posed each author the question-what would the world be like 50 years from now?  Veteran SF and fantasy writer Jane Yolen presents readers with a collection of delightful stories on the advent of her fiftieth year.  These range from the introspective, to the hilarious, to the gravely frightening.  Ten of these twelve tales are original to this production, and all of them are worth a read.  This anthology is directed at a young teen audience, as evidenced by the introduction by the editor.  Jane poses the question to her reader, what will the world be like in 50 years, when they are in their sixties.<br /><br />After a brief and imagination-provoking intro by Jane Yolen of what the future might bring, we get down to the business of the stories themselves.  Veteran readers of SF will recognize many of the names: Connie Willis, Nancy Springer, Anne McCaffrey, Patricia McKillip, Joe Haldeman and Susan Shwartz are just a few that leap off the page.  The stories all vary in length and tone, but they all address the world of the possible future, and the young people that may very well inhabit it.  Perhaps my favorite story is the tale that launches this collection: MUCH ADO ABOUT [CENSORED] by Connie Willis.  This delightful little gem launches itself at PC behavior and censorship taken to its extremes when a class decides to read Shakespeare.  They keep running into snags: The Drapery Defense League objects to Hamlet because Polonius is stabbed while he's hiding behind a curtain. Or there's the protest of the National Coalition Against Contractions (who feel that the use of contractions is directly responsible for the increase in crime rates).  WHO'S GONNA ROCK US HOME? by Nancy Springer is an emotionally laden tale of a young man who rebels against a drugged society and must come to terms with his father.  A QUIET ONE by Anne McCaffrey takes place on a horse ranch on a new planet-its not so much a SF story as one of character, and perseverance.  Joe Haldeman's IF I HAD THE WINGS OF AN ANGEL is a beautiful little piece about growing up inside an asteroid.  OLD GLORY by Bruce Coville is a chilling look at what our country could become and a warning to us today.<br /><br />There were a few stories that I didn't find as compelling, such as LOSE NOW, PAY LATER by Carol Farley, and MOBY JAMES by Patricia McKillip, but the fact of the matter is, the variety is enough to forgive the lack of interest in a few of these selections.  YOU WANT IT WHEN? by Kara Dalkey is a funny story and fine for a light read, but I felt it was a little too lightweight.  THE LAST OUT by Resa Nelson and David Alexander Smith is a nostalgic look at baseball, and they write a very touching story of the passing of the old guard.  EAR by Jane Yolen, considers the affect of technology on teens perceptions, and how it changes their world to turn it off.  FREE DAY by Peg Kerr looks at a bleak society and the touching relationship between a girl and an old woman.  BEGGARMAN by Susan Shwartz takes on the theme of being a misfit, and how sometimes being a misfit just means finding the place you belong.  There's not a terrible story in the bunch, honestly.<br /><br />Older readers may find the entire collection a bit young; it is targeted to the young teen readership, after all.  While these stories are already over ten years old, they still remain relevant pictures of what the future could be.  They are an excellent way of introducing science fiction to the younger generation in easy to swallow bites.  This collection is sadly out of print, so it's harder to find, but worth reading.  The hardcover volume presents the stories in easy-to-read large type that is comfortable to follow and may soothe young readers daunted by large books of tiny font.  I certainly enjoy the easy reading when my eyes get tired.<br /><br />If you enjoy this collection of SF stories, readers might also check out RACHEL AND THE ANGEL-stories by Robert Westall, or, if you can find it, YOUNG STAR TRAVELERS edited by Isaac Asimov, though I'm afraid it's also out of print.  For full novels, I'd recommend THIS TIME OF DARKNESS by H. M. Hoover, DEVIL ON MY BACK by Monica Hughes and THE GIVER by Lois Lowry.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshades by Robert Westall, or, if you can find it, YOUNG STAR TRAVELERS edited by Isaac Asimov, though I'm afraid it's also out of print.

Readers familiar with Virginia Lee Burton will know her penchant for bringing inanimate objects to life. This is a wonderful addition to those books, perfect for young children between the ages of 2 and 6.  This story was a favorite in my household when I was a child, much to the dismay of my mother who wished we would select anything else for a change! (She got sick of reading it more than once a week) ^_^<br /><br />The star of this book, in case anyone hasn't guessed, is a tractor named Katy who is a bulldozer in the summer and a snowplow in the winter in the city of Geopolis.  Geopolis could be any small city.  When a huge blizzard leaves several feet of snow behind, it is up to Katy to save the day, getting everyone where they need to go in Geopolis.  As the only vehicle that hasn't been stopped by the snow, Katy must prove her toughness and sense of duty by spending the whole day clearing the streets, earning a satisfying and well-needed rest at the end of the story. That's really the whole story.  Sound a bit uneventful?  Well, yes.  There's never a doubt that Katy will succeed in her task.  There isn't a great deal of interaction with human characters besides getting them where they are going.  So for a child who wants a complex plot more along the lines of MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL, they may be disappointed.  But, as I said, this book was a favorite in my house, and there were several reasons why.<br /><br />Repetition: stories for younger children with regularly repeated phrases like this one are worthwhile to the listener, if not always the reader.  Throughout the book the main line-`\\"Follow me,\\" said Katy'--is repeated every time Katy happens across more citizens in need. Children will soon be providing that line on their own in the course of the story.  Maps:  This was my first real introduction to maps, and it's a great tool for enabling your child to understand how maps work as they follow Katy's route through Geopolis.  They can trace her path on the page, and find the places she's headed to or hasn't plowed out yet.  You can begin to discuss concepts of North, South, East and West with them, and maybe even break out maps of your own city or town for their perusal and comparison. The pictures are simply drawn with lovely borders, and their young audience easily understands them.  Snow: It's a great introduction to what can happen during a snowstorm and the kind of trucks needed to clear the way.  It's a crisis without ever being a scary crisis for kids and still addresses the problems of a blizzard-getting a patient to the hospitals, getting the firemen to a fire, getting the kids to school.<br /><br />For the most part, I don't recommend this book for older children.  Even five and six year-olds might have outgrown this, unless they're reading the book on their own.  But it's a great book to read to younger children, especially if you live in a snowy clime!  If this is your first experience with this author, I highly recommend you check out MIKE MULLIGAN AND HIS STEAM SHOVEL and THE LITTLE HOUSE.<br /><br />Happy Reading!

Once in a land faraway, a truth fell from the sky and broke in half . . . and so begins the powerful fable told in lyrical words by Douglas Wood, accompanied by the evocative watercolor art of Jon J. Muth.  Compared to many picture books, this volume appears subdued and perhaps more than a little daunting for book shoppers.  But you know what they say about judging a book by its cover . . .<br /><br />The story woven into these pages is straight forward enough.  Mankind has got it wrong because they only have half the truth.  Finding the broken truth that proclaims \\"You are loved\\" the people of this fable immediately recognize how special and precious that truth is.  But, like so many things, the statement of truth becomes an issue who is loved and who is not.  The story follows the progression of people as they fall further and further from the natural world and the simple truths all around them in pursuit of one half of a broken truth.  Wars break out, and the world is a disillusioned, darkened place.  Bring into this a young girl who sees differently, and goes on a quest to find the missing part of the truth. The conclusion isn't exactly surprising, given the tone of the text-that mankind is missing the point and needs to stop the fear, the hate and the misunderstanding that have become common currency.  It's a good story, a powerful message, even if a bit simplistic.  But it's not necessarily going to be a picture book for younger children.  The tale at times becomes overlong, and the messages and themes are very mature ones-and may go over the heads of a young audience.<br /><br />What really makes this book worthwhile, though, is the artwork.  Brilliant watercolor images that are worthy of being framed and hung on the wall.  Jon J. Muth subtly conveys the elegance and power of this story in his soft images alive with light and color.  The pictures celebrate the connection to nature that is at the heart of the story.  It was the artwork that sold me on this book, and it's what keeps me coming back to it.  However, the maturity of the text is also reflected in the art.  Images are impressionistic rather than clearly illustrated and this may be challenging for young readers to understand visually.  It's not a bad idea to expose youngsters to these images, but you may want to simply discuss the pictures and what they think is happening rather than read the text.<br /><br />A child ready for THE STORY OF JUMPING MOUSE and JUST SO STORIES will probably readily enjoy this story and the young heroine's quest to find the truth.  Younger children may want to stick to retellings of AESOP'S FABLES, like The Tortoise and the Hare, or The Boy Who Cried Wolf.  Then, when your child is older, this book will be waiting for them!<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadis book, and it's what keeps me coming back to it.

Show the monster in your life who's boss with this delightful picture book from Ed Emberly! A book perfect for your youngster who might dread the thing that goes bump in the night or wonder what lurks under their bed, this book takes a rather direct approach to summoning, then banishing the monster, and empowering a child to do the same.<br /><br />The book itself is a wonderful example of a \\"movable book\\" in that the pages are designed to slowly reveal the face of a rather cartoonish monster through cut outs, so that the face is gradually revealed.  Starting with two \\"big yellow eyes\\", the pages progress through adding a mouth and nose and hair, until children can perceive the entire face of the monster.  Then the same process is done in reverse, with pieces of the monster disappearing as the text commands those pieces to go away, until the monster is gone.  This Cheshire cat-like visual trick is used effectively, and will not only give children some sense of power over the monster, but allows them to guess what will appear or disappear next, and to grasp the sense of shapes and color that make up the monster.<br /><br />The text is simple fairly large and appealing white text on a vividly colored page.  When the monster is being assembled, children can become familiar with the adjectives and colors used to describe each part.  The \\"big yellow eyes\\", the \\"long bluish-greenish nose\\", the \\"purple squiggly hair\\" and so forth.  As the monster is disassembled, the words \\"Go Away\\" are repeated on each page, larger than the rest of the text, and each command ends with an exclamation point, reinforcing the fact that the reader is telling the monster what to do. The last page declares \\"And don't come back!\\" with a smaller admission of \\"Until I say so.\\" Giving children complete control of the situation, and potentially encouraging them to go through the book again when they choose to. The pages in the hardcover edition are very sturdy and stiff, which is helpful when the book contains cutouts.  It's not likely to rip or tear easily, even if young hands are turning the pages.<br /><br />I personally love this book, and know many kids that enjoy it, but it may be too scary for your child if they aren't ready for it.  Despite it's cartoonish appearance, the monster does have \\"big sharp teeth\\" and could unnerve younger children.  You might want to discuss the book with them first, and see if they think they will be too scared or not-kids are pretty good at deciding that sort of thing. If the child is unsure, it may be better to wait until they are ready.  The power of this book is giving children control over the monsters they might imagine, and in providing a visual game of pictures that they can play again and again.  If you like this book and you're looking for others that deal with monsters and scary things, you might try THERE'S A NIGHTMARE IN MY CLOSET by Mercer Mayer, THERE'S A MONSTER UNDER MY BED by James Howe and WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE by Maurice Sendak.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^  Shanshade book contains cutouts.

After my last exploration into SF anthologies, which left me rather disappointed and jaded, this was balm for the beleaguered reader's soul.  A stunning collection of stories about space stations that manages stick to theme, but range widely in variety from the funny, to the chilling, to fascinating and heartwarming.  This book has something for every SF reader, and will especially appeal to those \\"hard\\" SF readers who are looking for some quality short stories.<br /><br />Out of the fourteen stories in this collection, I've been trying to pick a favorite, and keep coming up with several-which is, admittedly, a good sign. \\"Dancers At the Gate\\" by James Cobb is a wonderfully imaginative story about the technical innovation of a wormhole and a unique solution between two separate cultures to fix it.  Also at the top of my list is the anchor piece of this collection, \\"Station Spaces\\" by Gregory Benford.  The author's unique prose style won't work for everyone, but it certainly creates a space all it's own in marvelous imagery.  \\"The Battle of Space Fort Jefferson\\" by Timothy Zahn is a delightfully humorous adventure tale of a run-down station's moment of glory.  Other stories are nearly as good:  Michael Stackpole's  \\"Serpent on the Station\\" features his Purgatory station universe in an amazingly astute story that deals with faith and alien relations.  \\"First Contact Caf&eacute;\\" by Irene Radford is a bizarre look at mankind's first dealings with an intergalactic mediator in negotiations.  \\"Countdown\\" by Russell Davis is a rather short and pointed tale about life and death, and is surprisingly poignant for all its brevity.<br /><br />Out of the collection I found \\"Orbital Base Fear\\" to be one of my least favorite-it just didn't grab my interest.  \\"Black Hole Station\\" by Jack Williamson was interesting, but a little too pat a tale for me, but the concept was still a good one.  I found \\"The Franchise\\" by Julie Czerneda to be well told but a bit too long for it's conclusion.  But, overall, the quality is strong, the story telling imaginative and fresh and the stories are in keeping with the theme, but sufficiently varied in their approach.  I consider this to be an example of a five-star anthology.<br /><br />Readers who like this collection may also enjoy NEWER YORK edited by Lawrence Watt-Evans, MICROCOSMIC TALES edited by Isaac Asimov and, for a truly unusual themed anthology, check out CARMEN MIRANDA'S GHOST IS HAUNTING SPACE STATION THREE edited by Don Sakers.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^  Shanshad.

I can comfortably say that this particular collection is not one of his best.  The outside cover, the title, even the back copy all indicate the sort of \\"far frontiers\\" we expect.  Those frontiers of planets and galaxies under exploration.  What it doesn't imply is that this collection also covers inner space: human minds, dreams and emotion-the frontiers that are closer to home.  The most predominant tone in these stories is that of \\"soft\\" SF-stories about people rather than about technology or new worlds-and the stories themselves for the most part left me vaguely disappointed.<br /><br />There are some encouraging author names in here when a reader scans the title list: Alan Dean Foster, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Andre Norton and Jane Lindskold to mention those that immediately come to mind.  But don't expect to find their best work here.  The stories are more than a little pedestrian, not terrible to read, but not the kind of inspiring work these writers are capable of.  Among the stories that are the most interesting, \\"Traces\\" by Kathleen M. Massie-Ferch has a decent premise of a future where mankind's science is being hampered by the oppressive religion-run government, but I felt it didn't take events far enough to a satisfying conclusion.  \\"Forgotten\\" by Peter Schweighofer was a fascinating piece of writing-artistic and poetic in tone, but it seemed out of place in this themed collection.  \\"Ruins of the Past\\" by Jane Lindskold spun a good yarn with interesting setting and characters, but again seemed an odd fit for this collection.<br /><br />Quite frankly, this gathering of stories feels like a series of Twilight Zone scenarios rather than a theme of \\"far frontiers\\".  I was unimpressed by veteran Andre Norton's \\"Set In Stone\\"-a story about an alien slave on a strange planet.  Robin Wayne Bailey's \\"Angel On the Outward Side\\" reads like a swashbuckling adventure tale-there's some enjoyable writing and characters, but the story reads episodic, not something I'd expect to find here.  Sadly \\"The Cutting Edge\\" by Janet Pack just couldn't sustain my interest.  There was no real \\"hook\\" to it, no story beyond the use of nanotechnology in an operation.<br /><br />Overall, there are much better anthologies out there for readers.  This one is fine for a read, but probably not to invest in.  If you're a hard SF fan, this will definitely be a disappointment-as most of the stories remain focused on the human element rather than the science and tech involved.  If you enjoy short story anthologies, I'd recommend MICROCOSMIC TALES edited by Isaac Asimov, and NEWER YORK edited by Lawrence Watt-Evans.  Give this one a skim if you want, but be prepared to want something a little meatier and more original.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadwriting and characters, but the story reads episodic, not something I'd expect to find here.

In this futuristic adventure, H. M. Hoover delivers an action-filled plot that is perfectly in keeping with her young audience and has withstood the test of time. I've read a number of this author's works, and I've never been disappointed.  Unlike some childhood favorites that I've gone back to as an adult, Away is a Strange Place To Be does not lose its sparkle.  Sure, it's written for children, But H. M.  Hoover is well versed in her craft and consistently delivers quality writing and compelling storytelling.<br /><br />Twelve-year-old Abby is our heroine, living and working with her uncle on Earth at the luxurious Inn they own-she's not sure where she fits in or if she really wants to inherit the Inn when she grows up.  Bryan is spoiled rich kid who is unhappy with his life and his parents and never considers anyone other than himself.  All that changes when they are both kidnapped and taken to a far away artificial world of Vita Con to work as slave labor-the two of them have to work together to escape and get back home.  In the process the two of them must mature and learn from one another-but Abby is far from helpless and both of them are far from docile and helpless.  The threats are real-and clearly deadly.  From first line of this story readers know something has happened to Abby, and they will be eager to find out what and why as it unfolds. The pages turn fast and furiously to reach a satisfying and positive conclusion.<br /><br />What works so well?  H. M. Hoover uses strong character relationships to carry the story-the relationship of a young boy and girl and their friendship-though no romance here, these books are strictly preteen.  She chronicles how they both grow up substantially through their adventure, learning what their old lives have to offer and how to take responsibility for bringing about a better future.  But there's also an exciting adventure tale of kidnap and escape that any young person can identify with and enjoy.  Hoover's futuristic universe has familiar elements and dangers of our own, but the settings are imaginative and exotic-providing readers with new worlds to explore. There are too many stories I've read where the young heroes feel passive or talked down to, or the entire universe seems to be populated with well-meaning adults.  Hoover does not allow this to happen.  There are villains and self-interested adults.  There are helpful criminals and angry bullies who have painful secrets. Nobody is all good or bad, and getting back home isn't an easy business for Abby-it takes a good deal of ingenuity and courage.  It's a formula that will appeal to many young readers.<br /><br />At 167 pages, this book may seem a little thin for the adult reader, but its perfect for preteens.  There's enough detail to flesh out the world, but the pacing keeps the plot moving at a breathless clip.  Good food for thought and imagination, and perfect for the young science fiction fan looking for more out there to read.  If you or your child enjoys this book, please check out some of Hoover's other titles, including THE LOST STAR and THIS TIME OF DARKNESS.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadng person can identify with and enjoy.

It's a formula that will appeal to many young readers. <br /> <br />At 167 pages, this book may seem a little thin for the adult reader, but its perfect for preteens.  There's enough detail to flesh out the world, but the pacing keeps the plot moving at a breathless clip.  Good food for thought and imagination, and perfect for the young science fiction fan looking for more out there to read.  If you or your child enjoys this book, please check out some of Hoover's other titles, including THE LOST STAR and THIS TIME OF DARKNESS.  I don't think you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshad	2004-11-19

It's a Lunar 9-1-1 on Milk Street when the moon comes down-and it's up to everyone to help put it back in the sky.  I discovered this book purely by accident while I was browsing the picture book section, but I'm glad I did-it's a beautiful little treasure for any childhood library.<br /><br />In the urban setting of Milk Street one night, the moon comes down.  And all the children come to help dressed as firemen and policemen, all eager to fix things.  The text is very simple, perfect to be read to a very young child or read by a child just learning to read.  In some ways the restful and gentle nature of the lyrical words reminds me of GOODNIGHT MOON, but the similarities end there.  The warmly colored gouache and mixed media pictures are simply drawn, depending on a soft cartoon style rather than detailed-realistic.  They work perfectly with the words and subject, creating an almost dream-like feel to this story.  All the characters are children in their pajamas and animals, all running to help.  This is a proactive tale, a positive story of an emergency that is solved by cooperation.  And, by the time the children wish each other goodnight and go off to bed, readers know they well deserve their peaceful sleep.<br /><br />This book tackles some important issues.  Anyone familiar with what happened on 9/11 in 2001 will be quick to see similarities here.  The pictures of children clothed in police and firefighter gear gathered in the street and all pitching in to help is an echo of similar images people saw after the events of 9/11.  The moon dust on their pajamas even echoes the soot.  But the reflection isn't brutal or dark; the similarities are gentle reminders-not scary.  And the message is positive, and essential for children to hear.  When an emergency happens, people will band together to help \\"set things right again.\\"  It teaches children a powerful lesson within a fairly gently told tale that will inspire hope, not fear.<br /><br />This isn't a book about 9/11, of course.  It can be read to cover many different traumatic events and emergencies.  On the first page of the book, the author makes mention of Fred Rogers \\"when he was a child, if he ever came across a car accident or some other terrifying scene his mother would tell him,  `Look for the helpers.'\\" And that's what this book is about.  Helpers.  It is a tribute to them, and an inspiration to a new generation of them.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for children anywhere from age 1-4, and especially for children who might be coping with fears or worries that this addresses.  This is a remarkable little book and deserves some recognition for the beautiful art, musical prose and important message.<br /><br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadook about 9/11, of course.

Actually, I take that back, there is something better-a well-told, beautifully illustrated folktale.  And this is exactly what Molly Bang has presented readers here.  This simple Asian-styled tale of the mysterious stranger who rewards kindness is a familiar sort of story-but a bit of magic and music make it dance as surely as the magical paper crane in the title.<br /><br />In THE PAPER CRANE, an old man comes into a restaurant and is treated to a meal by the owner.  In repayment for this kindness, the stranger creates an origami crane out of a napkin that comes to life and dances with a clap of the hands.  A bit of simple magic and music in this Asian folk tale make it dance as surely as the paper crane.  The restaurant, which had been suffering from lack of business, suddenly becomes a popular stopover for people who want to see the magical crane and both the restaurant owner and his son benefit from the new business, and take joy in all the people.  Finally, the stranger returns, plays his flute to make the crane dance, and then flies off on the cranes back, never to be seen again.  A whimsical folk tale that imparts the message that kindness is rewarded.  The text is simple, easy to read on the page in a large and elegant font.  But that is only half the appeal.<br /><br />What makes this book so special is that all of the pictures in this book are full-color art paper cutouts that were photographed to preserve the 3-D effect of the pictures.  The impression is striking.  The textured images of the restaurant and it's inhabitants jump off the pages and will provide parent and child with an unusual, but appropriate set of images for this folk tale.  The pictures vary from full, double-page photographs, to smaller framed images, keeping the story moving and plenty for the eye to explore.  There's also a secondary story revealed by the pictures-that of the restaurant owner's son.  Never mentioned in the text, the boy appears on every page, and you follow him as he witnesses all the events that occur.  You see him drawing, or helping serve food, or playing marbles with another child.  And the very last page is dedicated entirely to him-you see him standing and practicing playing the flute in his pajamas.  Perhaps hoping he can play like the mysterious stranger had one day? Because of the folded paper nature of the crane itself, the paper images in the book work symbiotically to fit the theme of the story and complete the magic of folded paper and paper cutouts.  If you or your child is learning origami, this would be an excellent book to introduce them to!<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for ages 4-8, but parents are sure to enjoy the art as well!  If you like multicultural folktales, you might also want to check out THE EMPTY POT by Demi and THE MITTEN by Jan Brett.<br /><br />Happy Reading ^_^ Shanshad.ext, the boy appears on every page, and you follow him as he witnesses all the events that occur.

Her granddaughter is a constant helper, getting her through the day.<br /><br />This book is unusual in its first person narrative from the grandmother.  A light and heartwarming tale about the love and support between a granddaughter and grandmother, this story broaches the issues of forgetfulness in the narrator's life gently and humorously.  (The grandmother goes outside in her pyjamas, or forgets which day to do something.)  This light-hearted approach is supported by artist Dee Huxley's soft edged, watercolor pictures that portray such scenes as a house full of notes on every surface reminding the narrator of what to do. (the cat even has a note on its collar saying \\"feed me\\") But the whole issue turns poignant when the narrator can't remember her grandaughter.  But she focuses and slowly remembers her--from the girl's birth up to the present, and the granddaughter promises she'll be around to help her remember.<br /><br />This is a wonderful book for dealing with the forgetfulness and senility of of an older grandparent or relative.  It may not be as appropriate for children whose grandparent's are suffering from the severe stages of Alzheimer's, as the grandmother is still able to be fairly independent and the humor might feel unrealistic for the situation the child is faced with.  I still recommend it highly to parents, but situations will vary for appropriateness. Other books to look for about Alzheimer's include GRANDMA'S COBWEBS by Ann Frantti and WHAT'S HAPPENING TO GRANDPA? by Maria Shriver.<br /><br />Happy reading! ^_^ Shanshad	2004-10-04

It seems that Theo is somehow a reluctant pawn in the power games going on in this urbanized Fairyland-and his only ally is a smart-mouthed Sprite named Applecore.  After reading through Tad Williams' Otherland series and Memory Sorrow and Thorn quartet, I looked forward to this single volume fantasy story.  But while this story showcases Mr. Williams' skills as a world-builder with great imagination, it turned out to be a bit of disappointment with my high expectations of this author.  It's an adequate single volume epic faerie tale . . . but I'm afraid that's all it turned out to be.<br />The plotline isn't anything new: a musician with unrealized potential is dragged into a war between the elves.  There are more than a dozen books that explore this same concept. Now, I'll be the first to admit that a familiar plotline doesn't make or break the book, but it does mean the author can't rest on the laurels of originality.  What originality Mr. Williams' has imbued into this modern faerie tale rests in the fanciful world-building of urbanized Faerie realm.  While the opening is fairly slow and pedestrian, once our protagonist finds himself in this realm, things went along at a faster clip.  Tad Williams delights in showing off the little details of his world-the Dooney chauffeurs that smell their way, the ogre bodyguards that come in pairs, the house hobs-and manages to make that world come alive for the readers.  I will not argue that the author's created a fascinating place to set his story.<br />I could wish the story had been faster paced.  No one will ever accuse Mr. Williams of writing too brief a story, but it was only the fact that I enjoy the author's other books that kept me determined enough to keep reading until the story really got underway.  It took way too long for the author to set up our main protagonist-and the emotional bludgeoning he's put through (and we go through with him) to get there, is just overkill.  Once we get into the meat of the story, things get somewhat better-but much too slowly.  So much of the action feels drawn out and unnecessary.  And while most of the story seems to crawl, the climax and aftermath seem to scramble over themselves in an effort to finish. Character-wise, Theo, our reluctant hero, is a little too reluctant and dull-witted.  A few times I wanted to give him a good shaking.  It's hard to believe this character is supposed to be in his thirties-he's too callow.  Tad does manage to redeem him by the end of the story, but it's a bit too much a bit too late for me.  Overall, the main characters were not Tad's best effort.  Theo just isn't engaging enough, Poppy was a fairly cut a dry heroine without anything to distinguish her.  The main villain wound up being rather two-dimensional and uninteresting.  The secondary characters are another story altogether-Mud Button the goblin is one of the best creations in this story, and helps to salvage the tale along with Applecore, the feisty sprite and some of the other colorful denizens of Fairyland.  They keep the story entertaining enough for a three star rating.<br />Overall, this is an adequate read, but Mr. Williams has done much stronger work in his time.  If you enjoy faerie-scapes and urban fantasy this may fit the bill for some relaxing reading-if you have the patience for long stories. This may be one to pick up from the library.  If this is your first introduction to Mr. Williams, please consider checking out his earlier works: TAILCHASER'S SONG, Memory, Sorrow and Thorn quartet, and Otherland quartet.  If it's tales of elves and musicians you seek, try Mercedes Lackey's KNIGHT OF GHOSTS AND SHADOWS or Emma Bull's THE WAR OF THE OAKS.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadto set up our main protagonist-and the emotional bludgeoning he's put through (and we go through with him) to get there, is just overkill.

To give the damned souls of Hell another chance to repent.  The ineffable deity has responded to Dayne's challenge in an unexpected way releasing several thousand Hellspawn into the State of North Carolina.  And while heaven may be offering them a chance to repent, Hell has other plans.  They are to tempt more souls into hell, starting with the soul of Dayne.  Holly Lisle delivers a book that is full of fun and hilarity, and some food for thought as well as she takes a look at the institutions of heaven and hell and the world of humanity in between.<br />As with most of Holly Lisle's writing, there's a good dollop of humor in this story, keeping it from becoming darkly serious and overdramatic.  This allows the story to be thoughtful without becoming overly preachy.  Our heroine Dayne is delightfully tough and intelligent, a strong adversary for the fallen angel Agonostis.  And while most of the devils and demons remain more comical than outright darkly evil, and some even downright likable, the characterization feels appropriate to the tone of the story.<br />Despite the humor, there are moments of true poignancy and epiphany that keep this story from being merely fluff.  It's the reason I keep re-reading this book even though it's beginning to fall apart on me and I'll need a new copy soon.  While the look at religion is not necessarily the traditional one (Holly Lisle plays fast and loose with some of the conventions) there are still profound messages that Ms. Lisle conveys about the essence of faith, the nature of good and evil, how Heaven can exist if there is a hell, and what does it truly mean to be a human being.<br />One of my few complaints with this book is that while it offers a satisfying conclusion to the protagonist's story, it leaves an open ended teaser ending for the next story in this trilogy-and these books are a bit difficult to get a hold of.  Readers who enjoy humor, fantasy and romance and don't mind a rather tongue in cheek look at the denizens of Heaven and Hell are encouraged to give this book a try.  If you enjoy this one, the second book in the trilogy is THE DEVIL AND DAN COOLEY, and the third is HELL ON HIGH.

Tiffany Aching, the heroine of WEE FREE MEN is back for a second adventure where she heads off to learn the ways of being a witch.  And folks, let me warn you now that Terry Pratchett isn't about to send her off to a mysterious school of magic where you get wands with stars on them and learn how to do spells that go twing.  Learning to be a witch on the Discworld is another kind adventure entirely! At its heart, this is a coming of age story for Tiffany, who must face down a deadly threat called a hiver, and come to terms with her own self.<br />There's plenty of Terry's whimsical humor and wry satire to keep readers smiling and chuckling.  Especially when the Nac Mac Feegle make their appearance in the story, of course!  These little blue-tattooed Pictsies are delightfully irreverent and contentious, causing havoc and hilarity wherever they go.  Along with the humor, however is a good solid dose of heart.  I do believe Mr. Pratchett has done an exemplary job of making us care about the characters and creating believable, fallible and lovable.  I was surprised at how much I came to care about the Mac Feegles new kelda, Jeanie as she struggles to take on the role she's been born for. Jeanie isn't a main character in the story, but her presence and other little touches like her, fill Pratchett's story with echoes of meaning and magic.<br />If I have one complaint about this book, it's that it felt too short.  Events happened so quickly that before I knew it I was at the last page of the story.  I did feel as though there were places where the narrative could have been expanded upon, characters who were not as fully fleshed out as they could have otherwise been.  Still, for the younger reader, a shorter read is likely to be appreciated-and Pratchett can pack quite a punch even in a shorter form such as this!<br />Discworld fans that hungrily scoop up every new book by Terry Pratchett will be delighted to see Granny Weatherwax make a return appearance.  This time the most formidable witch on the Discworld stays for more than a cameo role, with delightful results.  Readers discovering Pratchett for the first time, you might want to grab WEE FREE MEN and read it first since it first introduces Tiffany Aching, but it isn't necessary to do so.  If you enjoy these books please look for Pratchett's other young adult books: THE AMAZING MAURICE AND HIS EDUCATED RODENTS, and THE BROMELIAD TRILOGY.

Lee So-Young has crafted a gothic-style vampire series that is likely to appeal to many of the shoujo audience who enjoy a blend of horror and fantasy with plenty of sexy anime guys appearing on the pages.  While the story is not particularly new or fresh, the art treatment is excellent and the overall presentation is bound to attract fans of manga who also like such shows as Buffy: The Vampire Slayer and anime like Night Walker.<br />Ji Ye is an artist studying Europe when the unexpected happens.  She winds up with a drunken vampire in her apartment that drinks her blood.  Rather than freaking out at this, Ji's dedication to her pursuit of art makes her decide that the beautiful male vampire is her perfect model for a portrait.  The two strike a deal.  Ji will allow the vampire to have her blood, if he will allow her to paint him.  Of course, Ji's in for a dangerous time of it, the vampire's inscrutable motives for allowing her to live and paint him are puzzling.  The complicated characters of the vampire, Michael, and his mysterious servants leave a mystery that is too irresistible for Ji Ye to leave alone.  Ji is perhaps the most refreshing character in this story, her obsession and fascination with painting tempered by a stubborn curiosity and a refusal to simply give in to the moody and threatening vampire.  I enjoyed the overall story, although at times the plot was a bit too predictable or clich&eacute; for my liking.<br />The artwork shows the true strength of Lee So-Young's craft.  She creates rich, textured backgrounds that evoke the mood and themes of this story beautifully. Old castle-like mansions, elegant clothing, and atmospheric touches all pay homage to the traditional vampire stories.  The two main male characters featured in this first volume are extreme examples of bishounen art.  Both extremely effeminate in appearance-too much for my personal taste-they do convey an air of unworldly beauty and alien motivations; separate from the world of Ji Ye and her peers.<br />Overall, this series will probably fit best with those readers who like paranormal romances, with overly romanticized vampires.  There is little violence or nudity to contend with, but the subject matter and relationships are not necessarily appropriate to younger preteen audiences.  A good manga with a decent storyline and creative, stylized art work that melds well with its chosen subject.

With this first volume of an unusual vampire series, Tokyopop has brought Kei Toume's work and artistry to the North American audience.  Kazuna Takashiro is a young high school student who is haunted by a mysterious past, and the secrets of the family who left him behind.  Now, his long-lost sister has returned, just at the time when Kazuna discovers that he too bears the curse of the Takashiro clan, and only his sister can help him.  For the Takashiros . . . are vampires.<br />Kei Tome has created an intense and unusual story of two vampire children, trying to cope with their condition and the bloodlust it causes before it can destroy them.  This horror/fantasy manga deals with the curse of vampirism differently than many other versions.  Kazuna and Chizuna live in the modern world, and Kazuna has grown up an ordinary teenager, dealing with school and his adoptive parents-the intrusion of this strange family curse into his life is met with confusion, and skepticism.  The story arc encompasses Kazuna's struggle as he tries to understand who and what he is, and reconnect with his long-lost sister.  Highly emotional, serious, and intense, this manga focuses on the variety of relationships existing between brother and sister and those they care about.  The action remains low-level, taking a back seat to the emotional exploration and internal battles.  While I enjoyed reading this manga, as I am a fan of vampire stories, I found the pace dragged a little, and the text sometimes didn't clarify what was going on.  Perhaps this was a problem of translation.  This is a fairly adult manga, there are some instances of violence, mostly involving blood, but nothing terribly graphic, and there is no nudity or sex.<br />The artwork is elegantly drawn, with clear lines, Spartan backgrounds and fairly contemporary looking characters.  Rather than the outlandish hairstyles and art of many shoujo, the look is basic, but dark.  Sometimes this works to the artist's benefit, allowing the story to maintain a very serious and shadowy feel.  However, at times it is difficult to discern the differing characters-the hair styles are so similar that it can be difficult to figure out which character is talking, which makes the story progression harder to follow.  There are no \\"chibi\\" moments to this manga intended to lighten the mood there are no comic or funny scenes-the mood remains dark and angst-ridden.<br />If you enjoy vampire stories such as Vampire Princess Miyu, this series may appeal to you.  But those who prefer action, magic, or mecha will probably not find this story line to their liking.  A decent, if somewhat limited first volume of a new vampire series, you may want to check this manga out prior to buying to see if it will appeal to you.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadd art of many shoujo, the look is basic, but dark.

This themed anthology series contains 25 different visions of the Big Apple.  Visions of the city as it will be, as it may be now in the dark corners and mysterious alleys, and, as it never was.  Lawrence Watt-Evans has collected a wide variety of stories from to create an anthology that takes readers from Central Park to the Upper East Side, to Chinatown and Wall Street.<br />The collection has a decent balance of stories, from the patently absurd, to the deadly serious; SF, fantasy and horror are all well represented.  Unfortunately my least favorite story is also the first in the anthology.  An off-the-wall pun-fest from Piers Anthony, Cloister is a bit too ludicrous for my taste, and a poor choice for a kick off story for this collection, as it is misleading in setting the overall tone of the anthology.  I strongly recommend readers skip Cloister (unless you like some seriously painful puns) and open with Getting Real by Susan Shwartz, which is my particular favorite story in the entire anthology.<br />Overall, this anthology is brimming with good picks: Getting Real takes readers down into the subways, and the shadow life of Temps.  Wild Thing by Eric Blackburn is an out and out horror story of the ancient terrors that can lurk in Central Park.  The Baby Track by Howard Mettelmark is a short-short with a hysterical take on an infant on the fast track to success.  Slow Burn in Alphabettown by S. N. Lewitt looks at a future NYC with a big trash problem.  Fans of Michael Resnick's STALKING THE UNICORN will recognize the alternate NYC in Post Time in Pink, where Resnick revisits his characters in yet another strange adventure. There are more than enough good stories to outshine the less spectacular fare.  I was not thrilled with the somewhat pedestrian The Cleanest Block in Town by Janet Asimov, and, as I mentioned, found Cloister to be painful to read.<br />Perhaps the most glaring fact is that NEWER YORK was published in 1991, and so is out of date by more than ten years. Long before 9/11 happened and altered the cityscape of Manhattan--therefore the futures rendered in this anthology cannot reflect on those events.  Nevertheless, it is a commendable collection and I'm grateful to Lawrence Watt-Evans for putting this book together.  Readers who are fans of themed anthologies should also check out the anthologies edited by Martin Greenberg and Andre Norton for some other excellent reading material.<br />Happy Reading ^_^ Shanshadpublished in 1991, and so is out of date by more than ten years.

The opening foreword by Isaac Asimov states that the stories chosen for this anthology mostly take place on Earth and feature young protagonists. All I can say is, the foreword and cover seem to have been created for a different anthology. The Introduction by Charles Ardai is more helpful in warning readers that this collection of stories ranges over a variety of fantastic worlds of all sorts.  This anthology contains a veritable hodge-podge of stories from Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine.<br />Despite my complaints, there are some worthwhile stories included in this anthology.  The illustrious Isaac Asimov's Profession-the story that sparked this anthology-is one such inclusion.  I also enjoyed And Who Would Pity a Swan? by Connie Willis, even though I was not expecting to find a fairy-tale retelling in this particular anthology and Still Time by James Patrick Kelly was a decent look at one man facing a nuclear war.  But the less than inspiring stories are numerous.  The Homesick Chicken by Edward D. Hoch is entirely set up for a bad joke.  The White Babe by Jane Yolen feels like an incomplete piece.  Fans of her Great Alta Saga will recognize the origins of White Jenna here, but the story itself doesn't feel satisfying.  Contrary to Asimov's opening foreword, the stories here are from all different worlds-some SF, some fantasy, some a mixture.  While I don't necessarily mind this, the overall effect of the packaging is misleading.<br />If you don't mind a sort of Pot Luck approach to an anthology, you might want to see if your local library has a copy of this to borrow.  But I'm not certain it's worth buying. Most of the contributors to this anthology have published far better work in their years at writing.  If you're looking for some excellent, quirky SF anthologies, I suggest skipping this one and checking out MICROCOSMIC TALES for a range of short-short classic SF stories, or some volumes of THE YEAR'S BEST SCIENCE FICTION.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadut MICROCOSMIC TALES for a range of short-short classic SF stories, or some volumes of THE YEAR'S BEST SCIENCE FICTION.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshad	2004-05-22

When the earth starts heating up enough that all of humankind is at risk, fifteen-year-old Jesse uses her stubborn tenacity to get herself signed on as one of the passengers aboard an experimental space ship that is meant to take them to another planet where they can start over.  But on this space-faring Noah's Ark Jesse quickly discovers that living under the tyrannical and idealistic thumb of their stern ship commander is the last thing she wants.  As the crew starts to fall apart, this fiery spirit may be the only one who can find a way to unite everyone once more.<br />I will freely admit that Anabel and Edgar Johnson have a wonderful talent for creating believable and compelling characters.  Jesse's first person diary-format story-telling pulls reader's right in to the story and the conflicts that are taking place.  This would be a fantastic young adult science fiction story-it's got a great plot arc, the story keeps us intrigued and reading in order to find out what happens to our strong-willed and likeable protagonist, and there is a good, satisfying ending complete with romance.  So what's wrong with the story?  I'm afraid I just couldn't buy the set-up for this story at all.  In the book, the earth is dying due to the greenhouse effect.  Commander Hammond decides to pilot a spacecraft to another planet in the solar system to save humanity.  This makes little sense for a number of reasons 1) Earth is still more hospitable than any of the other planets-so why not use the technology there? 2) Why aren't there more people trying to escape earth?  I doubt that the governments wouldn't be scrambling for solutions and escapes. 3) The ending, while dramatic, doesn't seem believable.  It's convenient for the sake of the story, but hard to accept as a reality.<br /><br />I could wish the authors had come up with another explanation for why this disparate crew comes together in space, because the story is worth reading.  The heroine is intelligent and capable-without being perfect.  Within the limited confines of the ship, the game of politics and power-and the fire of the human spirit-play out with some startlingly good observations about human nature.  I would have liked to give this book five stars, but I'm going to settle for four.  The contrivance to get our characters aboard this spaceship damaged the integrity of this story as a whole. Still, since this book is less about the science and more about the social interaction, it is worth reading, especially by a younger adult audience hungry for stories with strong female protagonists.  Those who like this book may also enjoy CALLING B FOR BUTTERFLY by Louis Lawrence and INVITATION TO THE GAME by Monica Hughes.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadng perfect.

Some folks will already be familiar with the anime; others may be encountering this graphic gothic for the first time. I have to say, as a both a manga and a vampire fan, I was delighted to find, Kohta Hirano's HELLSING volume one published in English.  The basics of the plot will sound familiar; a secret organization exists in England for taking on the paranormal baddies that terrorize the country.  This organization is called Hellsing, and in their corner they have one unstoppable tool, a generations old super-powerful vampire named Alucard who can stop any of the nasties and make them go Aaargh! Splat! in the night.<br />Probably on of the best things about the anime is that it never takes itself too seriously.  Despite the incredible amounts of violence and gore, the dialog tends to be wickedly funny.  Despite the allusions to Bram Stoker's DRACULA (After all, Alucard is Dracula spelled backwards) this manga quite gleefully ignores the Victorian sensibilities of the original tale and keeps the dialogue snappy and contemporary.  Fans of Buffy the Vampire slayer may find this manga right up their alley.  The story itself introduces readers to the cast of this series, Sir Integral, the head of the Hellsing organization and how she came to inherit the position with the help of Alucard their vampire who takes out the baddies for Hellsing others can't handle, and Seras Victoria, otherwise known as Police Girl who becomes Alucard's half-vampire servant when he saves her from dying.  Other than the various zombies, vamps and other paranormal creeps Hellsing must put down, they also face off against the Vatican.  Specifically section XIII of the Vatican; it's very own paranormal Special ops squad.<br />The art is fabulous, deftly shaded shots with plenty of detail and a real sense of motion and power that convey the action adventure drama of the plot.  The detail never becomes overwrought or lighthearted-although at times the drawing can be comic-and maintains the gothic flavor that is so essential. Be aware if you are just discovering this series that it depicts a great deal of blood and violence-and if this is not your thing, you may want to try something with less graphic detail.  For those of you who like a little carnage with your manga, this will probably suit you just fine. Delightfully action packed, wickedly irreverent, and artistically excellent, it's no surprise fans are already impatiently waiting for the next volume!<br />Be aware that the 13-episode anime series only loosely follows the manga storyline, so even if you've seen the anime, you won't be getting the exact same story.  If you enjoy this series and are looking for some reading, I'd recommend BLADE OF THE IMMORTAL and, in anime, VAMPIRE HUNTER D.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadflavor that is so essential.

Along their way, these two youngsters must use their special gifts to survive treacherous landscapes, deadly criminals, and the members of the Right Way commune.  It's a tough road, but the most dangerous thing that Carson will face just might be his own little sister!  MIND-HOLD is the second book in the author's trilogy of Young Adult stories of preteens gifted with psychic powers.<br />As a huge fan of stories featuring psi gifts Belden's trilogy was among my favorite reads as a preteen.  I especially enjoyed the way the author was able to make the powers themselves a believable part of the characters, a part of them that they had to hide from the adult world that doesn't understand them.  MIND-HOLD is an emotional book with a fairly swift moving plot and an accessible writing style, though Belden has clearly written this with a young teen reader in mind rather than young adult. Despite the fact that I enjoyed this series, this book remains the weakest of the three for me.  The main action plot-arc loses momentum about two-thirds of the way through the story, leaving the last third to explore what the author seems to feel is the real focus of the book, which is Carson's character growth.  While I've no objection to Belden's character progression, the loss of the central conflict leaves the ending with less impact and immediacy.<br />While the writing is accessible for the younger reader, this is not an \\"easy\\" emotional book to read!  Carson and Caryl are both thoroughly unpleasant characters at the opening of the story, and the author has to make a real effort for us to like them.  Carson appears very cold and distant-unable to feel much for others, while Caryl is a complete terror.  However, the author does achieve a level of sympathy for our characters with the reader and ultimately redeems her hero and heroine.  As I pointed out earlier, the book loses steam about two-thirds of the way through, resorting to almost too many \\"ending points\\" of Carson's shift in character to really keep a reader's interest.  At times the writing feels a bit simplistic, and the story has points where I felt the author gave away too much at once, or altered a character too quickly.  One glaring thing Belden does not provide is a sense of geographical place.  We know that this earthquake has happened, that it's somewhere in North America, but there's very little idea of where Carson and Caryl are as far as place names and landscape markers.  It's very much as if Belden wanted to avoid putting the events in any thoroughly recognizable location.  Also, because these books were published in the 1980s, readers may find them a bit dated at times in regards to technology.  Finally, one trivial point, but one I found frustrating was the similarity of our two protagonists' names.  It tended to make reading confusing, and I'd have to reread a sentence sometimes since I tend to read quickly.<br />For those who have read the first book, there's a chance to catch some familiar characters towards the end of the book.  However, since MIND-HOLD was made to stand as a story on its own, there's no need to read MIND-CALL first, the author provides enough background.  I do feel MIND-CALL to be the better book, though, and I'd recommend reading it if you enjoyed the second book.  And don't miss the third book, MIND-FIND, Belden's last book in this trilogy and my favorite of the three!<br />Happy Reading!

Its crew has finally reached the planet they were meant to colonize, but can a people who only know life aboard a ship adjust to life planet bound? The concept is an intriguing one that in the right hands could yield a powerful story of how a planet would look to those who had never experienced anything but space and stars.  However, as my star rating and title suggest, this is not the story it could have been.<br />The opening is dramatic enough-the main characters frantically struggling to deal with gravity and the strain it puts on their bodies.  And some of the observations and reactions of the Delos crew to things like rain, insects and sunlight are nicely done.  But this opening and observations remain the best parts of the story. I found the writing to be awkward and confusing, muddling the text and making it difficult to discern what characters were saying.  Sentence construction was unwieldy enough that I would not recommend this to the young reader age group it was created for.<br />Likewise, the story just couldn't hold together for me.  The author just never seems to decide exactly what the main arc of this tale is-whether it is the sudden rebellion between the crew members of Delos with some wanting to embrace the new world and others wanting to leave, or the challenge of uncovering the world itself and finding a way to live upon it.  The main \\"surprise\\" of the story's end is not much of a surprise at all, and readers are never given a clear explanation of the true purpose of Delos, and why it originally left the home world.  By the end, this was the only reason I was still reading.  There's not enough action, suspense or drama to really pull this story off, which was disappointing, because the idea is an excellent one.<br />If you are interested in young reader/young adult science fiction, this may be one to skip.  I'd recommend finding THE CITY OF EMBER by Jeanne DuPrau, or THIS TIME OF DARKNESS by H. M. Hoover to name just two tales where the young protagonists are on a voyage of discovery of the unknown.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^shanshadF EMBER by Jeanne DuPrau, or THIS TIME OF DARKNESS by H. M.

Dying girls are given a new chance at life, their memories wiped away, their bodies enhanced to create a unit of highly deadly assassins. The agency pairs a trainer/brother up with each cyborg girl and uses these pairs to deadly effect within a world of terrorists and warring political factions.<br />Despite the premise, it was a bit of a surprise to discover that the story within the pages was neither an action-packed fight fest with bullets constantly flying or full of scenes of high emotional outbursts.  There's plenty of violent gunplay within the story's context, but this volume focuses primarily on psychological exploration of innocence and violence, and the unusual relationship between cyborg and trainer.  This is not a comedy series, despite the indication on the cover jacket.  In GUNSLINGER GIRL the emotional energy appears as controlled as the girls themselves.  There are no exaggerated takes, no crying scenes.  Small smiles and frowns dominate the emotional landscape, but become much more powerful for their restraint.<br />Since this is not set up as one smooth-flowing story, but rather broken into five chapters, the  narrative does lose a bit of its action-adventure energy, and makes for a slower paced story.  A sense of bittersweetness underscores this manga from beginning to end, the feeling that what has happened to these girls is terribly wrong, and yet unescapable.  There is some concern about the young nature of the girls and their relationships with their brother/trainer but I found the overall relationships did not imply anything salacious.  While the love attachment fostered may not be exactly proper, this is part of the poignancy of this story.  There are no inadvertent panty flashes or seduction scenes to imply otherwise.  It is possible that the story arc will gain momentum from this introductory volume to come up with an interesting storyline for our heroines--with so little in this story that's not conventional, it may be difficult to pull off this manga series, but it has potential.<br />To my mind, the artwork is one of the best parts of this particular manga.  Beautifully drawn, the images consist of clean lines and borders, with little ornamentation, allowing the frames a clear and Spartan quality.  The action scenes contrast nicely with the more static dialogue scenes, really evoking the sudden transition of these girls from innocent children to deadly killers.  And while the violence is brief and refrains from being overtly gory, it is nevertheless effectively drawn. Yu Aida clearly knows his weaponry, and the attention to accuracy of the various guns the girls use will likely be appreciated by readers who are weapons enthusiasts.<br />This is a decent action/drama manga containing moderate violence, minimal sexual reference and no sexuality of a truly graphic nature.  No chibi cuteness and plenty of realistic weaponry.  But be aware that the psychological explorations certainly mean this manga is for a mature audience and may not be appropriate for the preteen reader.  I'm looking forward to seeing where this series will go.<br />Happy reading! ^_^ shanshadroductory volume to come up with an interesting storyline for our heroines--with so little in this story that's not conventional, it may be difficult to pull off this manga series, but it has potential.<br />To my mind, the artwork is one of the best parts of this particular manga.

You've got five minutes on a checkout line, or ten minutes at a train station and want something to read that won't take long, maybe something surreal or futuristic, or just plain wacky?  You've come to the right place!<br />Microcosmic tales is a book jam-packed with short-short stories, ranging from the span of a single paragraph to about four or five pages at most. Isaac Asimov, the esteemed editor of this anthology has likened reading good science fiction \\"to scuba-diving of the mind\\", a trip away from the world you know into another universe of the familiar.  Then these on hundred story gems are his idea of a \\"quick dip\\" into this genre.  These short-shorts come from all walks of the science fiction universe, from the patently absurd, to the darkly funny, to the thought-provoking and profound.  They're short, they're fun-they're like potato chips! Read one and you'll find yourself going back for more!<br />Contributors include SF masters such as Isaac Asimov himself, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert Silverberg, Harlan Ellison and James Tiptree, Jr. to name just a few.  Collected and reprinted from various sources, these stories-many from the golden age of SF-take the reader on journeys to other planets, future societies and altered perspectives.  This anthology was first published in 1980, and while some of the stories may be a bit dated on the surface because of this, the ideas and excitement are timeless.  There's some goofiness in here, and some punning-no, not every story is a classic work of staggering genius! For chuckles Arthur C. Clarke's \\"The Other Tiger\\" and Asimov's \\"Buy Jupiter\\" come to mind.  For profound there's \\"That Strain Again\\" by Charles Sheffield and \\"The Old Man\\" by Henry Slesar.  Just to provide a few examples.<br />The entire anthology is set up so that each piece includes a title, and a quote in bold lettering that sometimes gives a hint about the story or uses wordplay and humor to comment on the tale.  It's a delightful way to tie all these disparate pieces together in one volume.  Of course, this isn't the book you're after if you want complex character development and serious exploration of science fiction themes.  These stories are quick images and one-trick ponies-delightful in a short run, but taken any further would destroy the pithy humor and observation.  While not every story in this anthology will be to the taste of the readers, there is ample variety to appeal to a wide range. And it will give you to sample a range of classic SF writers and perhaps find a few you wish to explore in more depth and do some serious \\"scuba-diving of the mind.\\"<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ shanshadisparate pieces together in one volume.

Arthur Dunn is a clone catcher, and he always gets his man-er, clone.  The date; a future not all that far off, where clones are a reality and the rich use them as their own personal organ banks.  But what happens when a clone doesn't want to give up their their life?  That's when you send for a clone catcher.  When actress Kate Montagu's clone goes missing Dunn is called in on the case.  But there is more going on here than one missing clone . . .<br />This book is primarily a mystery story, narrated by our wry and clever Dunn, who would certainly qualify as a private detective in another story.  There are all the classic mystery elements, a missing person, a number of possible suspects, clues and threats, even a wrap up reveal for the denouement.  So, on one level, this is a fast paced mystery tale that will be easy for the 8 to 12 year old reader to access and understand. The one significant science fiction element is the clones, and this issue acts as the fulcrum of underpinning social themes of the book.  Are clones people in their own right? Should they be made to die so that their creators can live longer?  On this second level the theme is that of social justice and questioning our own attitudes towards people who are different, and who might not be recognized as people by society. It is not overly difficult to imagine what parallels can be drawn to current society issues.  There's a happy ending for all involved, making this a satisfying read on either level-there's even a bit of romance.<br />The text is easy to read, with black and white illustrations added every so often to break up the text.  This adds to the appeal of this book as a precursor to more complex reads in both genres, good for the reader who has graduated to chapter books, but may not be ready for lengthier novels.  It provides a good story with compelling and likable characters and ample food for thought-especially as we actually begin to see cloning as a real possibility.<br />It may be difficult to find this book, as it was originally published in the early eighties, and is sadly out of print.  But whether you are nostalgic reader returning to an old favorite or a new reader just discovering what SF and mysteries can offer, I definitely recommend checking it out if you can locate a copy.  If you enjoy CLONE CATCHER, Slote's written a couple of SF/mystery books, including MY TRIP TO ALPHA I, and MY ROBOT BUDDY.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ shanshadactually begin to see cloning as a real possibility.  <br />It may be difficult to find this book, as it was originally published in the early eighties, and is sadly out of print.

In a far-flung future, the people are told the air above is too polluted to breathe-there is nothing left on the surface anymore.  All that exists is the crowded underground city.  Eleven-year-old Amy has always been the curious sort, but she has learned to hide her curiosity-and the fact she can read-from the adults who watch her.  Until a strange boy tumbles into her world, claiming he is from the outside-and together the two of them must uncover old secrets and new worlds.<br />This is a rollicking preteen SF tale by H.M. Hoover that I found back in the eighties and was one of my favorites. Though this was originally published in the eighties, Hoover's ability to conjure up a another kind of world, to tell the kind of stories that speak to the reader and spark their imagination still shines through-so it's unsurprising that so many of her books are being reprinted for a new generation of young readers to discover and enjoy.  Hoover herself confesses in her bio that she wrote the kind of stories she enjoyed reading as a child-what better way to capture an audience? THIS TIME OF DARKNESS encapsulates the idea of  a strange, oppressive future society with appealing preteen protagonists.  Readers journey with them as the discover the way out of the darkness, but will the watchers allow them to find freedom and hope in the world?<br />Many will want to pick this book up out of nostalgia-having read this when they were kids-to revisit the story they remember, and maybe to share with their children who are just encountering science fiction for the first time.<br />This story is perfectly tailored to its audience, and while some of the future technology may feel a little dated since publication, the overall themes hold up well, and deliver their message of hope and perseverance admirably.  If you are encountering Hoover for the first time,  look for some of her other SF classics, like THE WINDS OF MARS, ORVIS, or my favorite, THE LOST STAR.

Sound familiar? Unless this is your first foray into fantasy, you've encountered all these elements before.  Douglas Hill's first book in this two-book young adult series published during the 1980's is not spectacular by any means, but it is a nice action-packed, short adventure story.<br />Young Jarrel has suffered a wound from the evil Poisoner's blade, and is destined to die by the next full moon.  Only by destroying the blade that gave him the wound can Jarrel be saved, and it will be up to Jarrel's new companions--Archer, Scythe, Mandra and the wizard Cryl-to help save him.  What follows is a lively journey to the Poisoner's lair to ultimately defeat the evil-and to discover what remarkable powers Jarrel may possess.  The book is only 192 pages long, which means the story detail remains pretty thin,  without much complexity and more than a bit clich&eacute;.  There isn't much recommend Hill's villains, they are two-dimensional evil caricatures that must be defeated, likewise the fantasy world itself mirrors just about any D&D fantasy setting. But the brevity of the story does have its benefits-the story doesn't bog down in exposition, the chapters are often less than ten pages long and it reads quickly.  All of these elements make it an appropriate and appealing read to a preteen reader, especially boys, who might be discouraged by longer books, and who are just beginning to discover heroic fantasy.  The author's  storytelling is strong  and his writing is decent , which makes even this bare-bones tale come to life and allows the reader to have a vested interest in the outcome. The book ends with a clear lead in to its companion volume, THE MASTER OF FIENDS, so  if you do pick this one up to read, be forewarned, you might want to have the sequel to hand when you finish.<br />Douglas Hill's published a number of books in the fantasy/SF genre, most of which have been out of print for quite a while.

In this post-apocalyptic view of the future, Japan is ruled by an oppressive king and his four sons.  The people have been reduced back to a medieval-like society, and wait in hope for the child of Destiny to come-the one who will make the desert bloom again and bring about a revolution.  When twins are born, the soothsayer announces that \\"this is the child of destiny\\".  Everyone believes that the boy twin is the chosen one.  Sarasa, his twin sister is overshadowed and all but forgotten.  She wonders what her own role is to be, whether she is simply the scraps left over.  But when tragedy strikes the village, Sarasa is forced into a role she never expected to be hers-and must become a leader to her people.<br />Basara is Yumi Tamura's 27 volume action-adventure shojo series, following the adventures of Sarasa on her quest.  Tam-Tam defines \\"basara\\" as \\"a free but noble spirit who disavows established authority and rejects the restrictions of  convention\\".  If, as a graphic novel reader, you're tired of school-uniformed heroines that need rescuing and overly cutesy artistry, this may be for you.  While clearly a shojo, or \\"girl-focused\\" manga series, Tamura's heroine is a strong and capable young woman facing believable dilemmas, and challenges.  Of course, there are plenty of cute men around to keep the romance factor  in the story, but there's also plenty of violence and action that keep the story moving forward.<br />Tam-Tam's gritty saga is well drawn, although she opts for a less highly detailed style that leaves an almost impressionistic feel, and allows the reader to fill in the back ground for themselves.  The style is not \\"pretty\\" as it may be in some manga, but this meshes with the story themes, which are not pretty either.  Admittedly, there are plenty of big eyes and wild hair-so if the reader prefers a more sedate and realistic look, this may not appeal.  Like most authentic manga, this book reads right to left.  Scattered through the story are little notes called \\"Tam-Tam time\\" from the author herself, these allow for a chance to lighten the mood as well see the story from the mind of Tamura herself.<br />If you like this first volume, good news! There are twenty-six more volumes to come.  Also check out Tamura's 2-book manga series, CHICAGO.  While not as detailed and epic as BASARA, it still features Tam-Tam's trademark action-adventure style with a strong heroine as the main character.<br />Happy Reading!

Unlike the gold-coated, black spotted cheetahs around her, her coat is sable with gold markings.  Everywhere she goes, she is hunted by strange creatures in sky vehicles that try to capture her. Unable to find acceptance or safety among her kind, she makes contact with another--amazingly like herself.  Kehknemt lived thousands of years ago, the companion of an Egyptian Prince. Through these shared memories across time, and the strange friendship Kichebo strikes up with small two-legged creature, the black cheetah hopes to find the answers to the questions of why she is so different, and what her future might hold.<br />Clare Bell has a real love of the big cats, and provides an insightful look into the lives of these large hunters.  Her depiction of the cheetah society does not try to over-anthropomorphize the cats into human beings.  Although they communicate in a sentient manner and are provided with personality and purpose, their behaviors and lifestyles remain those of powerful semi-solitary predators.  It makes for an interesting glimpse into how an intelligent society of cats might develop.  Beyond this, Kichebo's story is one coming of age and discovery of self.  The questions Kichebo most seeks an answer to are: \\"Why am I so different?\\" and \\"What is the meaning of my life?\\" Questions that are universal and easy to understand, if not easy to answer.  Kichebo is destined to take her people in a new direction, one she never imagined. The time travel aspect of this book gives us a fascinating look into what might have been in the days of King Tutankhamen, and the reasons behind the young King's early death.<br />This book is written with young readers in mind, much of Kichebo's search for self and struggle to become who she is will echo with adolescents who are going through the same struggle.  I read this book in my teens and have reread it several times since.  I think adult readers will find the story lacks the kind of mature sophistication they might be used to in adult science fiction, but it fits the intended readership well.  For those who enjoy this book, see if you can find Ratha's Creature, also by Clare Bell.<br />Happy Reading!

The poor servant girl who gets to wear glass slippers and go to the ball marries the prince and lives happily ever after.  That was before Terry Pratchett got ahold of the tale and put a few twists in it.  Magrat Garlick, youngest member of a coven of witches, has just become a fairy godmother-wand and all. Though the wand seems to be hopelessly set on pumpkins for some reason. And she's got an assignment:  to travel to the  far away magical city of Genua and stop Emberella from going to the ball. Joining her on this quest is the earthy and often double entendre Nanny Ogg and the ever popular Granny Weatherwax.<br />Don't expect any kind of typical adventure tale here.  Any one who has read Terry Pratchett knows that it won't be long until these three wyrd sisters traversing in \\"foreign parts\\" turn every familiar story topsy turvy in a combination of hysterical footnotes,  hilarious reactions (check out how the witches deal with the running of the bulls) and sometimes downright poignant observations on humanity.  Terry's humor is never devoid of the heart that keeps his work from becoming merely clever and slapstick.  Instead, this book reads as an insightful look at human nature and the nature of stories, and how the two are intertwined.<br />This is Terry Pratchett's 12th Discworld novel and American fans who have been trying to get ahold of Pratchett's earlier work will be delighted to add this book to their collection.  For new readers, (I'm a little envious of anyone discovering Pratchett for the first time)  your journey into the wonderful, hysterical, whimsical and insightful Discworld novels has only just begun.  There are more than twenty six tales of the Discworld to explore.  This reprinted paperback version has a sneak peek at Pratchett's next release, NIGHT WATCH, at the back of the book.  If you enjoy this book, please check out the rest of Mr. Pratchett's Discworld novels. To start at the beginning of stories featuring Granny Weatherwax, EQUAL RITES is her first introduction, but the better start is WYRD SISTERS which introduces the entire coven.

The mission: Self-Defense Force Rescue Sqad 4 is looking for survivors after Tokyo's latest earthquake.  Rei and her partner Uozumi are the only ones to survive when their team uncovers violence that was not quake caused.  Conspiracy and secrets have alienated Rei and Uozumi from their former lives, now they must get to the heart of the dark plots that destroyed the rest of their team, with the help of a private hostage rescue organization run out of a Shinjuku bar called Chicago.<br />Tam-Tam has created a strong, well drawn and well-paced action manga with a great heroine.  For any reader who has wished to escape the overly cute girls in skirts with killer weapons and find something a little more realistic in shojo adventure, this may be just the thing.  Rei is a motorcyle riding action-adventure heroine with an attitude who needs no protection.  She's out to protect others and rediscover herself in the process.  The artist's drawings are simple and sparing, without much ornament, but the overall effect is elegant and works well for the manga. Flowing lines and an elegant sense of motion and style maintain the feel. The overall story is dark, and gritty, but does not get weighed down with psychological issues and philosophies. In the end, the action is the story.<br />The action adventure tale does have its share of humor and chibi moments, especially in the form of Dr. Thunder Sanders, who seems to be Tam Tam's very own avatar in the work.  Unlike some futuristic works, this one is not really mecha in any sense-the time frame remains fairly close to the current one and most of the technology is familiar, although advanced.  Likewise, there is no magic in this series.  It remains pure action adventure throughout.  This is the first book of a short two-book manga Chicago series only recently translated for the North American market.  The artist/author is the creator of several acclaimed female-focused manga series, but this is the first one to hit American shores.  We can only hope more are on their way.<br />Happy reading!

This is a story that begins far away, with a girl and her dog and the powerful journey of transformation and meaning they endure.  It is a story without words, consisting of incredible images crafted with stark beauty and stunning ability.  The main character of the story, a young girl on the verge of womanhood lives in a peaceful, pastoral setting in some remote village-but coming home from the river one day, she discovers that her peaceable world has been drastically changed, and this sends her on a vivid journey that only Mr. Drooker's art can do justice to.<br />This is my first encounter with Eric Drooker's evocative imagery.  I'm determined it will not be my last.  This book epitomizes the legitimacy of the graphic novel as a valid and valuable medium of expression.  Powerful pictures crafted with a limited palette of colors make this story all the more striking and beautiful.  The feeling of being swept up in a powerful story, of emotion and depth is immediate and takes the reader from the first page to the last.  Perhaps the most remarkable thing is that this book can be read by anyone who can see the art on the page.  No poor reading skills will block it's story, no language barrier stands in the way.<br />Native New Yorker, Eric Drooker is certainly a compelling artist and BLOOD SONG showcases his work in fine fashion.  The art will likely appeal to a varied audience of viewers.  The views presented in the story and the author's attitudes towards governmental authority might not appeal as widely.  Mr. Drooker doesn't \\"mince words\\" with his story, nor does he pull his punches.  But the larger message in Drooker's work is one of universal connection, hope and humanity in a continuing cycle.<br />Even if you've never encountered a graphic novel before, pick this one up, page through it.  If that simple act doesn't keep you turning pages I'll be very surprised.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^  --shanshad	2003-02-02
US	42584545	R12KFIHP74IBZH	1931514585	750887337	Mars #1	Books	5	31	33	N	N	Star-Crossed Romance--Manga Style!	I was a little skeptical.  Here I was an adult reader checking out a high school romance manga?  That was when I picked up the first volume of MARS, Fuyimi Soryo's 15 volume manga series. The verdict? By the end of reading the first I couldn't wait to find the second.  To date I have the first seven volumes and am eagerly awaiting the eighth.<br />The basic storyline is pretty familiar: Kira Aso is a shy, but talented art student.  Rei Kashino, a motercycle-racing, wild-living bad boy.  The two are about to meet.  But if you think this is a plain bad boy- good girl romance with a cast populated by light-hearted high schoolers, think again.  This is no sitcom school story, and doesn't read like one.  Kira's emotional intensity strikes an unfamiliar chord in Rei, one that he is drawn to.  The bond between them is based on something that their peers can't begin to comprehend, leading to anger and violence.  Both Rei and Kira have their personal demons to deal with, and their relationship is not an easy one.<br />If you don't have any interest in romance or manga, MARS probably isn't for you.  But for what it is, this series is exceptional. I wouldn't recommend this for very young readers, since the violence is at times intense-although not graphically so, and the sexuality of the characters is defined for a teenage maturity.  The artwork is amazing --combining a compelling sense of movement and moment with beautiful imagery and simple structures.  The artist moves from  multiple boxed images on a page to single breath taking pictures.  The smooth and consistent quality here is one of my appreciations of the series.  I will admit, the eyes are overly large in this manga, but that is artistic style and I found it easy enough to accept once I fell into the story.<br />For those unfamiliar with the traditional manga format, this series reads from right to left and can be a little disorienting for those not used to it.  Check the back of the volume for the chart provided on how to read the manga page in this form.  I personally prefer this format over for manga over the westernized (left to right) publications, it simply feels truer to form and style.<br />While there is no fantasy, tech, or sf involved, the story is a complex read and the graphic quality of the manga is excellent. Readers who have encountered and enjoyed shoujo manga series such as Paradise Kiss and Peach Girl, will definitely want to give this a try!<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ --shanshadon how to read the manga page in this form.

This review is specifically relevant to Volume II and should be read as such.<br />&quot;In a world of dark cold night they are sleeping . . . a land which knows no time of peace.  Beckoned by human shouls in chaos, they slip from the darkness. I hunt these stray Shinma. And I am the guardian of their sleep.&quot;<br />Bittersweet and thought provoking, Vampire Miyu is not your typical gothic vampire.  This eternally young girl is cursed by her destiny to send stray shinma (demons) back to the dark.  To the humans on which she must feed she grants eternal happiness. Her only companion in this destiny is Larva, a shinma who is bound to her by blood as her servant.<br />These graphic novels are like poetry, rich in imagery and metaphor, meant to be read several times over before the layers of meanings are grasped.  The lush art style is darkly beautiful, and complements the story well.  Ironcat studios has done English-speaking fans a great service by translating Miyu's story for a whole new set of readers.<br />Having accepted her past in volume one,  Volume two deals with Miyu's hunt of stray shinma.  The title: Encounters, is appropriate, as Miyu encounters the bizarre and extraordinary, even in the universe of the vampire girl.  These encounters will strike readers as right off the pages of a fairy tale, only these are dark fairy tales, and few have happy endings. Mermaids summon handsome young men down to a strange aquarium, the myth of the doll forest and Pinocchio come to life, and men with wings seek to keep their little birds in cages.  I've reread this volume about four times and I've yet to discover all the layers at work.<br />One complaint with Ironcat's production here, it seems like the artwork was not fit as exactly to page as the first Volume and at times the text and pictures are slightly cut off at the bottom of the page.  It's a bit of a flaw in an otherwise shining work.<br />Please note that this review is for the second book in the series: Vampire Princess Miyu: Encounters specifically.<br />Happy reading! ^_^ shanshadthe page.

With the help of some rather unusual allies, some divine intervention, and a whole lot of luck and courage!<br />Ms. Hilgartner deftly weaves the lives of her vivid and delightful cast into a tale of high adventure. When a plot to kill the scholar king is uncovered by a plucky young thief named Ferret, she and her young friends soon find themselves unwittingly embroiled in a dangerous world of court politics, with enemies and suspicion at every turn.  Each character has their part to play; their move to make in the intricate game that means their very survival.  The author maintains a brisk pace, keeping the action moving and all of her characters vivid in the reader's minds.  This is a pleasant, if not completely original, romp through an adventure fantasy and perfect for YA readers who enjoy a good story. Those looking for something breathtakingly new may find the plot and story elements all too familiar.  Street thieves, beggar children and kings in danger are all fairly traditional elements, but they in no way make for a dull story, as Ms. Hilgartner does an exceptional job whisking us up into her world and her characters' adventure.<br />Perhaps my main complaint with the book was that the central villain of the book was a little overdone, so that the result was more of a caricature than I think the author was aiming for.  The villainy and cruelty is so over the top in a story where most of the characters have more complex motivations that I wished for a little more subtlety.  The author's technique of maintaining a large cast of characters and jumping from character to character has its drawbacks in that the story never gives readers enough time or text to touch on the inner lives and emotions of cast.  The reader is ever kept at one remove, and the emotional impact of the events is not as powerful as it otherwise could be.  One last concern was the dizzying number of names to keep track of; most of them containing the letters y, z, or h in some combination and making it hard to remember who was who at times.<br />Ms. Hilgartner's writing has only improved with time, and this book is one of her best to date.  She is a fine storyteller with a real sense of pacing and energy as well as a skill of weaving her plot threads together into a satisfying whole.  While epic fantasy fans may find A BUSINESS OF FERRETS a bit lightweight, it is an excellent, engaging tale and will likely appeal to those readers who enjoy Tamora Pierce and Mercedes Lackey.

Ferret, and her band of friends and allies must work together to stop a deadly new threat that has arisen in the kingdom.  But this time, the enemies are hidden well, the threats are much more deadly, and the stakes are higher than ever.<br />There's a marked shift between the two books that's evident almost from the opening.  Readers are no longer dealing with a group of slum-children, but adults in their own right.  All of our characters have made their way in the world, gaining maturity, wisdom and skill.  They are not pawns this time, but active participants, seeking out the enemy and finding ways to stop the threats against them.  Owl has finished his training as a Seer and come home to Bharaghlaf, only to find himself immediately working to stop an ancient evil magic with the help of his old friends, and some fascinating new allies.  Who are the enemies, who are potential?  Everyone is suspect, and numerous plots are at work.<br />The maturity of this book proves that Ms. Hilgartner's writing skills are increasingly getting better.  The relationships, emotional ties and character motivations are painted in much more vividly than the last book, and serve to tie readers into the narrative much more effectively.  A great deal more attention is paid to developing characters to the fullest. Those who have read Ms. Hilgartner's older books, THE COLORS OF A DREAMWEAVER'S LOOM and FEAST OF THE TRICKSTER will  recognize some of the character prototypes.  These prototypes have been honed and vastly fleshed out into the characters they were meant to be.<br />The greatest trouble I had reading this was the even larger cast of characters and the dizzying number of similar names.  It becomes difficult to tell everyone apart with the repetition of `y', `z', and `h' in nearly every name.  The animal names of Ferret and her gang are the only names that stand out starkly and clearly by comparison.<br />Unlike A BUSINESS OF FERRETS,  this second book ends with a clear lead in to a third book.  I guess I will just have to wait for the third to see what happens to the characters next! ...<br />Happy reading! ^_^ shanshadclearly by comparison.<br />Unlike A BUSINESS OF FERRETS,  this second book ends with a clear lead in to a third book.

To aide her in the eternal quest is her masked servant, Larva, a shimna bound to Miyu by her blood.  But who is Miyu? And how did she come to be a vampire?  This manga tells the story of Miyu and Larvas origins and explores the price she must pay to fulfill the role she was destined for.  For new readers, I would recommend starting with this volume, as it sets up the narrative and characters that the later graphic novels follow.  The NEW VAMPIRE MIYU series is a spin-off of this original, and while its not completely necessary to know the back story, it can help provide readers with a stronger sense of the history upon which this series was written.<br />Unlike the spin-off series, Vampire Princess Miyu is published in the traditional Japanese format which means the book reads right to left instead of left to right and the text on each page is written vertically (top to bottom) Publishing these manga novels this way means that the graphic images did not need to be flipped when they were translated.  Considering how lovely the artwork is in this manga, minimizing the distortion required to bring this book to an English-speaking audience is a boon.  Readers not used to the format may find it awkward at first, but I believe it adds to the experience of reading.  To aid the reader, the front matter contains a helpful visual tutorial to aid readers and acquaint them with the Japanese-style graphic novel. The artwork in this first volume is absolutely beautiful in its execution and arrangement.  The artist plays with light and shadow and uses an artistic style that matches the story.  You wont find the elaborate detail so often used in CLAMP novels; it would feel out of place in the elegant poetry and subtle poignancy of the story.<br />If you are expecting a sensual or violent vampire tale of blood drinking and monster fighting, you might not find Miyu quite what you are looking for.  The stories move like poetry, full of emotion and powerful themes about humanity and the nature of dreams.  Readers who prefer sexual satire or action adventure may feel disappointed by the dark and gentle pace of this graphic novel.  At its heart, this volume is a beautifully translated and stunningly illustrated exploration of the dreams that drive each of us and what they mean to the human soul.  This remains one of my favorite graphic novels, and I pull something new out of it every time I read it.<br />If you enjoy this manga, Id recommend trying to find the other volumes available in the Vampire Princess Miyu series.<br />Happy Reading!

They've had to cut corners on their dreams to afford a house and three kids.  They've out grown their youthful daydreams and become cynical in their day-to-day lives.  They certainly don't believe in other worlds, legendary creatures or magic rings.  But whether they believe in them or not, these things are about to slam into their lives-big time.  Suddenly, their kids are stolen away to another world, Minerva is stuck in an alternate dimension, Darryl is stuck with a beer drinking dragon and both the bad guys and the good guys are out to get them.  Trouble? You bet!<br />This whimsical, engaging romp is one of my favorite tales by Holly Lisle.  Both Minerva and Darryl are appealing characters that readers can identify with and root for.  There is enough humor woven in to keep this story from taking itself too seriously, and to allow the characters to remain human and endearing. Ms. Lisle's strength is really in her characters.  In all her stories she manages to create people to care about and want to know more about.  Without that characterization and sense of humor, this tale would be fairly pedestrian and forgettable. The basic plot elements are familiar-mystical rings, dragons, worlds in jeopardy, a reluctant hero and heroine-but Ms. Lisle manages to keep her tone fresh and compelling despite the clich&eacute;d fantasy themes.  The secondary characters of the three Kiakra children and Birkwelch, the off-color ditty-singing dragon, help to round out the cast and keep the adults from taking themselves too seriously.  Birkwelch is perhaps my favorite creation in this story.  He's lewd and sings off-key, but he's also the best ally that the Kiakras have in their fight to save their children and themselves.<br />For those readers who prefer darker fantasy, this might not be your cup of tea.  It's a great book for a reader to cuddle up with for a light, entertaining fantasy read.  This isn't epic drama, and isn't intended to be.  My main complaint with the story, and the reason I can't give it five stars, is the ending.  The conclusion wraps up a little too neatly and easily, with a little too much wish fulfillment going on for me to be comfortable.  I'm as in favor of a happy ending as the next reader, but I would have preferred something slightly more serious.  Still, for light reading its something I certainly recommend.

Having read the earlier novels that make up the Bedlam Bards miniseries: KNIGHT OF GHOSTS AND SHADOWS, and SUMMONED TO TOURNEY which Mercedes Lackey wrote in partnership with Ellen Guon and BEDLAM BOYZ by Ellen Guon, I was looking forward to this next installment in the Bedlam Bards series.  Since Rosemary Edghill has explored elves and urban fantasy prior to this, it seemed natural that a partnership between the two for BEYOND WORLD'S END would work well.<br />For those new to Bedlam Bards, I think the best place to start is with the earlier stories, but it isn't entirely necessary.  Enough background information is thrown in that I think new readers will easily fall into the story and get to know the characters.  In essence, this is a true urban fantasy, taking place in the heart of NYC and naming places that every reader familiar with the Big Apple will recognize.  The enemies to be faced are both human and elf-dangerous drugs that have are on the threshold of creating a menace that could destroy two worlds.  Set against this threat is one powerful human Bard, the flute-playing Eric Banyon and his new band of allies. Can they prevent their power hungry enemies from claiming NYC as their own?<br />The story premise is interesting and enticing.  The promise of hearing about old friends and characters from related stories was what got me to pick this up in the first place. To their credit, Lackey and Edghill provide a story that delivers on that promise and moves along quickly.  However, to my disappointment, I did not feel the story delivered on the premise.  Despite my attachment to previous characters, I would have honestly preferred a more streamlined story, one that focused a bit more on plot.  If this were Eric's coming of age story, I might be more forgiving of the time spent setting up and explaining his character.  But it's not, Eric's already grown up and trained, there's no real transformation required.  And while I admit to enjoying the details about Kory and Beth, they are not part of this story, and having their cameo appearance just felt awkward and unnessessary.  The most complex and fascinating character is by far Ria, since she is the one facing change and transformation. Had the story focused on her from the outset instead of Eric, I think the overall dynamic action would have felt stronger.  Changing players might have allowed more freedom to keep old characters in, but seen from a new perspective.<br />Eric's return to Julliard seems contradictory on several levels, as other reviewers have commented.  No one seems to notice his extraordinary youthfulness, since anyone looking for him would be seeking a man in his forties.  Likewise, Julliard itself seems inconsequential, a reason contrived so that Eric is in New York, rather than a real story in and of itself.  The time spent showing Eric in those surroundings and students he befriends have no bearing on the outcome of the main conflict. The same goes for the Guardians Eric befriends.<br />Despite this, Lackey and Edgehill still manage to deliver a a compelling read with interesting new characters and old favorites that readers will be delighted to see on the printed page once more. One other quick observation, his book was written pre-9/11 and, as such, some of the scenes in the book were more than a little chilling, particularly to this New Yorker.  I'll be looking forward to reading the sequel to this, SPIRITS WHITE AS LIGHTENING, I'm hopeful that some of the loose ends left at the end of this story will be dealt with there.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^ Shanshadal transformation required.

A wild young man named Reindeer who isn't a man at all.  When the land of two moons becomes threatened and treacherous, it is up to these two to guide Caribou's people to safety, and a new home.  Can Caribou convince the tribes to follow her beyond the burning plain where the golden reindeer go?  Can she trust the shape changer she loves to guide her there?<br />This prehistoric fantasy is a powerful tale of love and courage.  Ms. Pierce always writes strong, convincing and ultimately likable heroines. The title hardly scratches the surface of this tale, and if Ms. Pierce lacks anything in her books, it is decent titles.  While this story does indeed contain a bittersweet romance, it is secondary to the story of Caribou's growth from a young girl living outcast and alone with only a strange child for company to a capable and confident woman who will lead her people through the burning plain, past the Firekings and trollwomen. Caribou never falls into \\"the damsel in distress\\" role in the story, all her dealings are direct and honest.  It is, in fact, this honesty that makes her such a likable and interesting character.  She's not a crafty heroine; she's a leader and a teacher.  She's a visionary.  Reindeer fills the roll of trickster and chaos in her life, they are very much opposites.  Caribou, a woman of deep emotion and direct honesty and courage.  Reindeer a creature of wile and deception without a human heart. Yet each is forever bound up with the other, and the love Caribou has for Reindeer is a powerful thing.<br />Ms. Pierce uses this setting to make observations on human society in general.  The clan chief siblings who gain power, all deal with the looming end of their world in their own, ultimately futile way.  One wishes only to prepare for war against an enemy.  Another ascribes to the philosophy of \\"eat and drink and be merry, for tomorrow we may die\\".  A third believes the gods must be appeased with sacrifices and prayer.  None of them heed Caribou's warnings and offer to guide them through.  While these examples were handled in relatively simplistic manner, they fit within the style of the story.  Ms. Pierce's lyrical style and marvelous imagery transforms this story into something that will touch the heart and capture a reader's imagination.<br />Reader's who have loved Ms. Pierce's  Darkangel Trilogy should absolutely give this one a try.  If this is your first Meredith Ann Pierce story, please consider trying her Darkangel trilogy that also features a strong and likeable heroine and her quest to destroy the Darkangel who stole away her best friend.  This is one not to be missed by YA readers!<br />--Happy Reading! shanshad ^_^ust be appeased with sacrifices and prayer.  None of them heed Caribou's warnings and offer to guide them through.

US	42584545	R1223MC82SI8OZ	0446675601	953338601	Midnight Robber	Books	3	12	13	N	N	Nalo Hopkinson Surely has  Stolen a Torturer�s Tongue!	With a voice and a world-building style startlingly different from the usual SF or Fantasy author, Ms. Hopkinson transports readers into an altogether different sort of future.  The story is of Tan-Tan, a young girl growing up on the Caribbean-colonized planet called Touissant.  There she lives in relative wealth and comfort, until her father flees the authorities, and the two become exiles in the strange, and unforgiving world of New Half-Way Tree.  It is in this realm of strange creatures, and hard-bitten men and women that Tan-Tan must come of age, and discover her own story.  The struggle is a long and arduous one, and persevering against all the odds will cost Tan-Tan a great deal more than she imagines.  It is this struggle and her growth into adulthood that allow her to take possession of the Robber Queen myth for herself.<br />There is so much here that is impressive.  Ms. Hopkinson's skill with world building is a treat.  So much of the standard fantasy and SF scenarios and metaphors are cleared from the field, and a wealth of mythology, story telling and culture from the African and Caribbean worlds are set in place.  The result is a departure from what this genre usually has to offer, a deft weaving of myth and technology a grittier and oft-times harsher world-view.  The narrator's poetic voice and author's skilled use of language serve to cement the landscape and confirm that the reader has departed from the tried and true paths, into the wilds of another culture, another realm, where anything might happen.  The Caribbean flavor of the language is spicy and powerful-strong and primal.  These are storyteller words, delicious to read aloud and savor.  And Ms. Hopkinson is able to paint her story with this language without making the read ponderous or awkward. Ms. Hopkinson provides a much needed voice in the realm of women's and multicultural fiction.  There is not enough representation of African or Caribbean voices or main characters in today's SF and Fantasy, and this author's efforts are helping to help fill the gap.  She's a strong writer, with a lot of potential and a hungry audience waiting for her to fulfill that potential.<br />Beyond the praise, however, I didn't feel that MIDNIGHT ROBBER was quite the story it could have been, despite all that is wonderful about it.  Ms. Hopkinson sets up readers for an exotic and flavorful feast-but does not pace the meal well.  The story seems to be forever waiting to start.  So much goes on, and there are magical breaks of story telling from the narrator, but these stories and the life of Tan-Tan don't really meet up until the last bit of the book.  The narrator refers to telling an anansi story, but I felt the spider's web somehow got disconnected-and didn't quite make the tapestry they were aiming for.<br />At the opening of this tale, Ms. Hopkinson introduces Tan-Tan's father, Antonio as a complex and interesting character involved in political intrigues and a troubling love life. Yet, these first scenes and actions seemed to have relatively little to do with the story that develops.  Antonio fails to remain interesting, instead becoming a vehicle by which Tan-Tan is swept into the world of New Half Way Tree.  The world of Toussaint, as compared to New Half Way Tree, where two thirds of the book takes place, was actually the more vivid and fascinating world.  New Half Way tree seemed simplistic by comparison.  Simplistic and brutal.  Characters tended to be less developed than their environment. Ms. Hopkinson's debut novel, BROWN GIRL IN THE RING was more complete in regard to story and pacing.  The villains were obvious, the goals were comprehensible and the outcome satisfying.  In MIDNIGHT ROBBER these lines are not as clearly drawn-and didn't allow for a comfortable conclusion.  The story begs for a sequel, for the rest of Tan-Tan's magical and legendary heritage to be revealed.<br />Similar to her debut novel, Ms. Hopkinson has created a story is strongly feminist in tone.  It's refreshing to see strong women characters that face the world on their own terms and it's beneficial for young readers to have another type of heroine to identify with.  However, I must contend that Ms. Hopkinson's male characters in this story are almost entirely vilified and/or emasculated.  There is no male protagonist in this book that commands respect or admiration.  Nearly all the men are full of villainy and corrupt thoughts and motives.  I think it a disservice to Tan-Tan's character that there is not any male characters that come close to being a match for her-either as allies or adversaries. It would allow for a more powerful story. A word of warning to readers, this is not a light or sweet book.  It deals with dark and violent imagery and actions.  Rape, murder and treachery are all part and parcel of this story. It is not a \\"fairy tale\\" in the way so many readers are exposed to them today, but it has a lot in common with the older, darker fairy tales that are their origins.  At its heart it is a story of survival and overcoming obstacles; it is a story about human perseverance and the power that resides in one's self.<br />Personally, I think it would be worthwhile to see a story set solely in the world of Toussaint-there are so many elements of the lifestyle and technology that exists that Ms. Hopkinson only touches on in passing, and I would enjoy seeing them explored further. I can only hope Ms. Hopkinson's writing will improve and that she will continue writing, I feel she has a lot to offer her readers and look forward to her future endeavors.<br />Happy Reading! -shanshad ^_^inist in tone.

US	42584545	R39VJJCCB3XM7A	0886773024	731086508	Sword and sorceress III : an anthology of heroic fantasy	Books	5	6	6	N	N	Putting Women in their Place-As Heroes of the  Fantasy genre	This is Marion Zimmer Bradley's third anthology of sword and sorcery fiction devoted to stories where women are the protagonists.  They come in many forms, warriors, thieves, mages, healers, wise-women, adventurers and wanderers.  MZB sticks to her guns throughout-these are not romances, nor are they stories where women are the sidekicks, or simply women to be overcome by a more powerful male.  Instead, this anthology holds a wide range of stories, and an infinitely wide range of heroines.  Since the first Sword and Sorceress anthology, these stories became increasingly popular, so that MZB had received rampant submissions for this third anthology from hopeful writers.  Most of her intro delves into her editing methods, and what she expects from a story.  Readers get to see a bit of the process behind selection, as well as MZB's sharp and humorous personality that I personally found delightful.<br />MZB once more serves up a range of voices; from familiar returning favorites, to brand new first sales.  Probably one of the most noteworthy new authors, in my opinion, is Mercedes Lackey.  \\"Sword Sworn\\" is, I believe, Misty's debut as a published author, and is certainly the first introduction to her unforgettable mercenary heroines, Tarma and Kethry who are the protagonists of Lackey's later novels; OATHBOUND and OATHBREAKERS.  Lackey has gone on to quite a career since then, but even this first short story showcases her talents as a writer.  As to returning favorites,  MZB has included an interesting tale of a dragon and a young nature-wizard \\"Dragon Amber\\" by Deborah Wheeler (noteworthy, in part because Bradley tends to dislike any sort of  `clich&eacute;' dragon story), \\"Valley of Shadow\\" by Jennifer Roberson, \\"Journeytime\\" by Dana Kramer-Rolls, \\"Marwe's Forest\\" by Charles Saunders, and  \\"The Mist on the Moor\\" by Diana L. Paxson.<br />\\"Journeytime\\" by Dana Kramer-Rolls, \\"The River of Tears\\" by Anodea Judith, and \\"Sword Sworn\\" by Mercedes Lackey are more serious ventures, dealing with the transformation of character and the journey, both physical and spiritual, these characters make.  Unlike her first two anthologies, number three has a greater number of serious stories, the balance of humor is not as prevalent, still there are one or two that lighten the mood.  \\"Orpheus\\" by Mary Frances Zambreno is about an unusual pair of women adventurers sent to retrieve a soul from the underworld, and \\"Bargains\\" by Elizabeth Moon where the bargains in question, may be no bargain at all.<br />Among my favorites is \\"A Tale From Hendry's Mill\\" by Melisa Carpenter, an interesting take on the `rape and revenge' theme, and one very likable heroine.  \\"More's the Pity\\" by L. D. Woeltjen is a haunting tale that works its spell very effectively in a few short pages.  As mentioned above, \\"Sword Sworn\\" by Mercedes Lackey is her introduction to two female mercenaries, and a powerful story of both sword and sorcery-and vengeance.  Perhaps the most intriguing story is Jennifer Roberson's \\"Valley of the Shadow\\".  It's one you'll just have to read.<br />All of the stories in this anthology are strongly written and well selected, although there are quite a few longer, more serious pieces than in the last two anthologies.  I still consider this collection worth five stars, but could have wished for one or two shorter humorous pieces interspersed in the mix.  For any reader who enjoys reading stories about women in fantasy, this is definitely a good place to find them! If you have read this anthology and have enjoyed it, I highly recommend finding the first two anthologies-they're just as well written!<br />Happy reading! ^_^ --shanshad, dealing with the transformation of character and the journey, both physical and spiritual, these characters make.

Beloved author/editor Marion Zimmer Bradley created this anthology in 1984 to address just that issue.  At a time when women's fantasy was just beginning to make its mark, MZB created an anthology to define the emerging female protagonist.  In her introduction, MZB makes it clear that she wanted to avoid the stereotypical Amazon-type heroine who ultimately gave up her freedom to win love.  She didn't simply want recreate the old clich&eacute; turned upside down-where the men are subservient to women.  She wanted stories that gave women new myths to identify with, powerful stories that could be worth consideration by the men and women who read them.  This collection is not your average \\"feminist literature\\", these are stories that feature warriors, magic-users, healers and thieves-the women of fantasy, the kind of women to give a new generation of fantasy readers characters to see parts of themselves in, and ultimately make readers think.<br />MZB must have been onto a good thing.  In the nearly twenty years since the first publication, there have been 19 Sword and Sorceress anthologies to date.  Having read all of these anthologies, I can honestly say that this remains one of the best.  The originality of the stories, the quality, the variety; all of these elements make this particular shine out from the group.  Out of the fifteen stories, four are written by men, including well-recognized authors Glen Cook and Charles de Lint.  MZB prefaces each story with a short blurb about the author and a few comments of her own. These paragraphs, along with her introduction, enable readers to catch the glimpse of MZB's personality and some insight into why she chose the particular stories she's included in this anthology.  It becomes clear that each story was selected with care, polished and set in place to augment this anthology.  There are no \\"filler\\" stories here.<br />Readers skimming the contents will quickly recognize quite a few of the author names; Glen Cook, Emma Bull, Charles de Lint, Jennifer Roberson and Diana Paxson to name a few.  For Emma Bull and some of the other authors listed, this is their first sale.  That is an additional bit of delight in these earliest Sword and Sorceress anthologies.  So many writers made their first sale, or were just beginning their careers at the time.  As to the stories themselves, they are as varied as the authors.  For sword and sorcery duos, \\"The Garnet and the Glory\\" by Phyllis Ann Karr and \\"The Rending Dark\\" by Emma Bull are good examples.  For darker, emotionally charged reads, try \\"Severed Heads\\" by Glen Cook, or \\"Sword of Yraine\\" by Diana L. Paxson.  On the lighter side there is \\"Taking Heart\\" by Stephen L. Burns, \\"Daton and the Dead Things\\" by Michael Ward, and the finale of the anthology, a short-short story by Dorothy J. Heydt, \\"Things Come in Threes\\".  My particular favorite story-although I admit it is hard to choose just one, all of them have had a powerful impact-is  \\"With Four Lean Hounds\\" by Pat Murphy.  This is a beautiful, fairy-tale-esque story that is as powerful in its message as in its unfolding adventure.<br />Any reader who loves good fantasy, particularly short stories will likely enjoy this.  Women readers especially-but in no way exclusively will appreciate the chance to read about women as protagonists of the epic fantasy story.  When this was first published, there were much fewer female fantasy writers and stories available.  This has changed dramatically over the intervening two decades.  Despite that, it does not diminish the quality of this first anthology-and the stories remain as strong today as they were when published.  On a side note-these are all fantasy reads-MZB as a rule does not include science fiction stories in any of her anthologies, although the right story can make her break the rule just a bit.

This is Marion Zimmer Bradley's second anthology devoted to exploring the fantasy genre and the women that inhabit it.  These aren't romance stories, or tales of Amazons ultimately defeated by a superior man, or domestic stories.  These are tales of adventure, where the protagonists are women of the sword or magic staff who actually do something. Despite the cheesy \\"pulp-fantasy\\" cover that this second anthology had the misfortune to display, the stories are anything but cheesy.  They cover a vast array of tones and styles, ranging from the epic struggle, to the tongue in cheek, to the rough and tumble.  These gals aren't waiting for the handsome Hero to step in and rescue them. And with skilled editor Marion Zimmer Bradley selecting the stories for this anthology, each short story has something to offer.<br />Those of you who have read through the first anthology in the series will note the presence of a number of the same authors, as MZB herself mentions in her foreword.  \\"A Night at the Two Inns\\" by Phyllis Ann Karr continues the adventures of Frostflower and Thorn-- Karr's gentle sorceress and tough swordswoman duo.  Likewise, Diana L. Paxson continues the story of her character Shanna with \\"Shadow Wood\\".  Other returning authors include Stephen Burns with \\"The Black Tower\\", Charles Saunders with \\"Shimenge's Mask\\",  \\"Fireweb\\" by Deborah Wheeler, and \\"Cold Blows the Wind\\" by Charles DeLint.  Jennifer Roberson also returns with \\"The Lady and the Tiger\\" which features, I believe, the first appearance of her now famous Tiger and Del characters.<br />Warrior women, thieves, craftswomen, sorceresses and assassins all populate these pages. Some stories are straight adventure and epic fantasy such as \\"The Black Tower\\" by Stephen Burns and  \\"Shimenge's Mask\\" by Charles Saunders.  Others are biting and surprise the reader with their endings.  Try \\"The Lady and the Tiger\\" by Jennifer Roberson or \\"Hunger\\" by Russ Garrison.  Still others are just sincerely funny.  Don't miss Elizabeth Thompson's \\"On First Looking Into Bradley's Guidelines, Or Stories I Don't Want To Read Either\\" which does a fine job at elaborating the things that Marion Zimmer Bradley didn't want to see submitted for this anthology.  The editor was tickled by the poem; I suspect readers will be too.<br />Beyond the varieties, there are a few tales that defy simple definition, and shine out in this collection.  Popular author C. J. Cherryh pens \\"The Unshadowed Land\\"; a story that gave the editor goose bumps-not to mention me!  The other one I will note is \\"The Wound in the Moon\\" by Vera Nazarian, this was the authors first published story and is truly a beautiful, disturbing and thought-provoking piece.<br />What makes these anthologies stand out, besides the exceptional stories and powerful heroines, is MZB's own introductions to each story and author.  Her comments are almost as delightful to read as the stories themselves.  For anyone who likes this anthology, I highly recommend you check out the first Sword and Sorceress anthology if you can find it.  The good news is there are now nineteen Sword and Sorceress anthologies to read and discover, but I will firmly uphold that the earliest anthologies, particularly the first three, are some of the best.<br />Happy Reading! shanshad ^_^Elizabeth Thompson's \\"On First Looking Into Bradley's Guidelines, Or Stories I Don't Want To Read Either\\" which does a fine job at elaborating the things that Marion Zimmer Bradley didn't want to see submitted for this anthology.

The other one I will note is \\"The Wound in the Moon\\" by Vera Nazarian, this was the authors first published story and is truly a beautiful, disturbing and thought-provoking piece.  <br />What makes these anthologies stand out, besides the exceptional stories and powerful heroines, is MZB's own introductions to each story and author.  Her comments are almost as delightful to read as the stories themselves.  For anyone who likes this anthology, I highly recommend you check out the first Sword and Sorceress anthology if you can find it.  The good news is there are now nineteen Sword and Sorceress anthologies to read and discover, but I will firmly uphold that the earliest anthologies, particularly the first three, are some of the best.<br />Happy Reading! shanshad ^_^	2002-06-11

Finding this fairly slim book shelved in the Young Readers section, I suspected the book would be a fairly quick, enjoyable read.  I can honestly say, I did not find the kind of story that I was anticipating.<br />Marcus Aurelius is a 17 year old who has strange powers that he doesn't know how to explain to anyone.  He's plagued by feelings of guilt for the terrible thing he may or may not have done to his girlfriend Jules. Now he faces a new town where the people are not quite who they seem to be . . . and they have been waiting for Marcus. On the surface, the story is familiar.  A young man who doesn't quite fit into the community he has grown up in discovers he has extraordinary powers and has to come to terms with what these powers mean and who he will be.  The story is told from the protagonist's (Marcus Aurelius)POV in first person.  While this adds a level of insight into the character, the semi poetical and limited vision style of the writing tends to keep the reader confused as to what's actually going on.  This is unsurprising since Marcus spends most of the book being confused as well. The writing style is different, and could be refreshing for a reader who wants a break from the typical narrative. There are many aspects of this book that worked well together, but I found a few key concerns as well.<br />While I have nothing against trilogies as a rule, this is one example in which I felt furious at the end of the story. As a reader, I was just beginning to feel comfortable with the author's style and the character's voice and then-- the story ended. This book comes across as more of a set up, or an introduction than a story in and of itself--I don't quite understand why it was made into a trilogy, the break off point for this first book is certainly dramatic enough, but I never got the sense of a story, only half of one. So, those readers who may want to try it, I recommend waiting until the second and third books are in easy reach, as I suspect the story will be more satisfying as a whole.<br />My other concern is on the placement of this book.  I found it within the Young Readers category, where it certainly does not belong. The protagonist is 17 years old, and one of the central themes of this story revolves around his sexual awakening. This is not a book for 12 year olds who have just come from Harry Potter.  Sex, Death and guilt seem to be some of the main underpinnings of this story--and I do not think most young readers are ready for these themes.  Parents, pleased be warned, this is not a child's story.  And it is not a happy story by any stretch of imagination.<br />The tone of this story is dark, strongly melancholic and laced with guilt and confusion.  There's some startling violence and flashes of painful emotions as well as desire. To give the author credit, this tone and atmosphere may very well be what its like to live inside a young man's mind who is just verging on adulthood, I cannot say for certain.  But there is a significant lack of joy, of real love or connection to things that make the book dream-like, or more to the point, nightmare-like.  It's an interesting read, and those looking for something beyond the usual wizards and witches might find this story worth their while.  But it is incomplete without the other two books in the trilogy.<br />Happy Reading!<br />shanshad, those readers who may want to try it, I recommend waiting until the second and third books are in easy reach, as I suspect the story will be more satisfying as a whole.<br />My other concern is on the placement of this book.

He is told by Them; \\"You are now a discard.  We have no further use for you in play.  You are free to walk the Bounds as you please, but it will be against the rules for you to enter play in any world. The rules also state that you are allowed to return Home if you can.\\"<br />So begins a young man's journey to find his way home and to solve the mystery of \\"Them\\". The They are playing their mysterious games throughout the worlds--and only the Homeward Bounders know about Them. Forced to constantly move on from world to world, Jamie teams up with two others who have been cast on the Bounds. Will they have a chance to defeat \\"Them\\" and find their way home?<br />This is is one of Diana Wynne Jones' more serious young adult books, written much earlier in her career. While it contains her trademark imaginative whimsy and strong, likable characters, the overall tone remains fairly serious and at times downright somber. However the author's use of first person POV to tell this story, keeps the tone easy to relate to--as if Jamie is telling his story to the reader.  Like so many of her other stories, this one deals with the possibility of multiple worlds, and those that can travel between them.  A surprisingly powerful story that will leave readers thinking about the nature of reality--and the power of hope.  The ending was surprising, but ultimately satisfaying.<br />I'd recommend this book for any YA readers, especially those who enjoy the fantasy genre.  As it has just been reprinted, this is an excellent chance for fans of the author to check out one of her earlier works that has been hard to find. Just be sure to watch out for \\"Them\\"!;)	2002-06-02

Is that anything like wonderbread?\\"  I actually read the sequel to this book, BORN OF FLAME, years before I ever found a copy of this title. Since it is out of print, it can be mighty hard to find. The book is probably best described as a young reader's space opera or science-fantasy. And despite the rather disconcerting names, it turns out to be a fairly good read.<br />Spacebread is a large white cat who is an intergalactic space traveller and adventuress--sort of a Han Solo of the feline persuasion.  Having just returned from a dangerous mission, she's ready for some rest and relaxation--that is, until a murderous theif steals her belt buckle and kills an one of her friends.  Now, Spacebread is off on another adventure, to reclaim her belt buckle, avenge the death of her friend--and possibly to stop more dastardly plots that surround her quest. Along the way, she gains an unusual mix of allies.  A vegetable alien slave being who Spacebread rescues from harm, a blind woman who can see what others cannot, and a very dashing black cat.  Soon, Spacebread's quest becomes about more than a missing belt buckle--and the fate of an entire world may hang in the balance.<br />This is delightful space opera! Think spaceships, swords and swashbucklers! The author writes a fairly serious and dramatic story, and despite the unconventional characters he people's his worlds with, the story is convincing in its melodrama. I have to admit, the pictures included in this book tended to jar me. Because, unlike the text, which treats the existence of intelligent cats in capes and boots, and floating vegetable aliens with ice guns, as normal and likable characters, the pictures tend to take a less serious approach.  The resulting art feels like a caricature and doesn't quite match the tone of the writing.<br />For a light read with plenty of adventure, this might just fit the bill. Young readers who are interested in cat fantasy stories will probably like this.  While not as archetypal as Star Wars, or as memorable as The Three Musketeers, it is an entertaining adventure--pure fun for a rainy afternoon or a late night under the covers with a flashlight.  If you can find this book, and enjoy it, be sure to check out Born of Flame which continues the adventures of Spacebread.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^<br />--shanshad.

I'm going to be very lonely.&quot; When a ghost appears to young Barney and speaks these words he's terrified.  Barney's always been a little different, but what can the eerie voice that haunts him want? It's up to Barney and his big sister, Tabitha to find out what's happening.  Something, or someone is coming to fetch Barney--and its getting closer each day. Tabitha is about to discover that her ordinary family . . . is not so ordinary after all.<br />Mahy has a way of weaving supernatural elements into the ordinary everyday world and allowing the reader to experience both in a fascinating tapestry.  The subtle, but powerful magic that takes over the story.  The mysterious past of a long-lost relative become intriguing elements as the plot unwinds.  But what gives this book its power is the element of family and the varied and often challenging relationships that exist.<br />Various family members act and interact with each other in different ways, with surprising undercurrents and support structures.  It's interesting to see how these peices all fit together--Mahy doesn't present readers with a perfect family, but a family with its ordinary flaws . . . and one very extraordinary, tantalizing secret.<br />This book will probably appeal most to the sensitive reader who enjoys subtlety and emotional development vs. direct action and adventure.  Children feeling out of place, whether in their family or in society, may identify strongly with this story and gain an inkling of their own identity.  This might be for the child who is looking for something more sophisticated than Harry Potter, yet enjoys the aspect of fantasy and magic in a contemporary setting.<br />This book was my introduction to Margaret Mahy. The author has written a number of books that explore paranormal and supernatural elements.

My mother read this to me when I was about twelve years old and I still remember the musical cadences of the narrative that pulled me into the story, that made it an expressive and powerful tale.  On the surface, this story has a plot that is similar to the one of E.T.  An alien worker, mistakenly left behind by his comrades, is abandoned on Earth and must communicate with a human boy in order to survive and get back home.  But that's very much on the surface.<br />The narrative is split in POV, balanced between Tyro, the \\"fallen Spaceman\\" in his gigantic space suit.  And the humans who encounter him, most significantly a young boy Erik, whose fate ends up tangled with Tyro's when he accidently becomes trapped in the damaged suit.  This is a powerful, optimistic tale about understanding and hope for the future, but its also an excellent SF story.  Descriptions of the enormous spacesuit and how it is used, the difficulty of breathing the air of this planet, small peices of technology are interwoven into the story without it ever losing its poetry or emotive qualities.  Most importantly, its done in such a way that a child of eight years or older should be able to enjoy the story.<br />The narrative never falls into the trap of \\"dumbing down\\" for its audience, but does a remarkable job of remaining on target while still appealing to mature audiences.  I highly recommend this book as a read-aloud.  Parents and children will both enjoy the experience.  The particular copy I have also contains line illustrations by John and Ian Schoenherr that aide in visualizing the story.  It's not an easy book to find, but if you come across it, please give it a try--this is a treasure whether or not you are a SF fan.<br />Happy Reading! ^_^<br />--shanshad	2002-05-20

I haven't read this book in a number of years, due to the fact I cannot find a copy. However, since I read it years ago, the story and title have stayed with me--which is a clear sign of a good, thought provoking book.  The story takes place in a future where nuclear war has occurred and the birthrate has dropped off, so that scientists are looking into cloning as a solution.  Particularly, the cloning of people from the twentieth century.  The test group has been created from some genetic material that was recovered from the WWII period. This is the \\"Rag, bone and hank of hair\\" that the story refers to.  A boy of the future is sent in to interact with this test group of two children and a maid.  These three have been conditioned to believe they are living in WWII England. They are provided with false memories and stories and have no idea that they are in a far-flung future.  The boy interacting with them undergoes a profound change of character as he works with them, coming to understand something of the nature of humanity, and himself.<br />What struck me most about this was the power of story and belief upon human experience, and how this ultimately shapes the startling ending of the story. The perceptions we have at the beginning are dramatically reworked by the last few pages. And the story provides some food for thought. With cloning becoming a real possibility in today's world, some of the questions raised here might not be so far off base.  I found it to be an excellent SF read, with some wonderful accounts of what it would be like to be in England during WWII bombings. I'm hoping to get a copy one of these days so I can reread it.  Hope you can find one too!<br />Happy reading! ^_^<br />--shanshad	2002-05-20

His themes are not comfortable ones, particularly for parents.  He deals with the internal desires of children, the kinds of things that can be interpreted as unacceptable and frightening. For instance, WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE, which has become a classic in children's literature is about a boy who acts out--who becomes a \\"wild thing\\" himself. His transformation back into a boy is a gradual and wonderful part of the picture book, but in no way tries to deny that the \\"wild thing\\" aspect exists.<br />Likewise, OUTSIDE, OVER THERE is a tale of siblings, jealousy and responsibility.  The heroine is Ida, a young girl who's father is away and so Ida is left to watch her baby sister, a task she's not too fond of. Ida is much more caught up in her own world. Yet when her sister is kidnapped by goblins, Ida must go off on a magic adventure to rescue her.  She's not wholly devoted to the quest at first--and nearly passes her sister right by when she becomes absorbed in the magic of the quest.  In the end, she rescues her baby sister, destroys the goblins and returns home--this time firmly responsible for her sister and determined to be so until her father returns home.  It is not a comfortable tale, but it is one that highlights feelings that young children may have and discusses them in a format they can identify with.<br />The language and pictures are beautiful and stunningly poetic, in typical Sendak style.  But the story and the way its told can be frightening for some children; themes of kidnapping by goblins, the ice-baby left behind, and Ida's making the goblins dance themselves away, all conjure images that hit on some primal fears and discomforts.  The author is not trying to make us comfortable, but that's what makes him such a good author.  I suspect people will either love or dislike this book, I'm one who loves it but can equally understand why others might not.  So, if you can, take a look at it prior to buying and certainly before you read it to younger children.<br />On a side note, I believe this story is the basis for the movie Labyrinth. This wonderful movie is a strong tribute to Sendak in so many little ways, but the overall premise of the movie is very similar--a girl's jealous of her new half-brother and wishes the goblins would come and take him away.  They do, and she must deal with the goblin king and the challenge he sets before her in order to get her baby brother back.  Fabulous movie--if you love the book, I bet you'll love the movie, or vice versa!<br />Happy reading! ^_^<br />shanshadbuying and certainly before you read it to younger children.<br />On a side note, I believe this story is the basis for the movie Labyrinth.

This is, at its heart, a tale of adventure and danger undertaken by a mute boy named Aaron.  When his mother doesn't return from her journey, Aaron sets off in search of her, braving the dangerous woods and uncertain terrain of winter.  When he stays a night at the Half-A-Moon Inn, he becomes a prisoner of the unscrupulous proprieteress, Mrs. Grackle.  Aaron is a virtual slave--unable to tell anyone his plight and forced to help Mrs. Grackle as she spies into her guests dreams. It's up to Aaron to use his wits and courage to figure out a way out of this situation.<br />This is one of those, \\"what happens next?\\" stories that keep you reading and [pull] you in until the last page.  And perhaps the best part of this story is the proactive young hero. Aaron's adventure comes about because of his own choices and his own abilities.  Young readers will readily identify with the young man and feel his frustrations and triumphs. While the story is certainly one of the \\"coming of age\\" variety, it is also a hearty adventure tale.  This is a fabulous read-aloud to share with younger children.<br />Although published in 1980, this book is timeless in its appeal.  Like any good fairy tale, or adventure, the hero wins out and the villains get their come-uppance.  This is a valuable addition to my library!<br />^_^ Happy reading!<br />shanshad	2002-05-20

This is one of those books that is chiefly written for SF &amp; Fantasy fandom by the SF&amp; Fantasy fandom.  As such, readers new to the genre may find it puzzling why anyone would love a book with such a strange title and theme chosen for its short stories.  The origin of this anthology is a song written by famous filk (SF music, for those who are unfamiliar with the term) singer Leslie Fish. Apparently the song came about after &quot;too much turkey and eggnog . . . and a table centerpiece decoration  . . . and space age music on the hi-fi that just happened to swing into a rhumba&quot;.  To get the full story, you'll have to read the Afterword in this anthology.<br />It's an unexpected anthology, with a wide range of tones and styles.  &quot;Provisional Solution&quot; by B.W. Clough is a very light toned, lively take on the manifestation of Carmen and her trademark fruits.  &quot;Basket Case: Or:The Grapes of Wrath&quot; by Bruce B. Barnett interprets the themes into a hard SF detective story with delightful success. Don Sakers, the editor of this anthology, has two short stories in this collection.  The first is &quot;The Man Who Travelled in Rocketships&quot; a touching story that's meant as a memorial to Heinlen. The second is &quot;Tarawa Rising&quot; about an aging drag queen coming to terms with themselves with a little ghostly help.  Other authors include, Anne McCaffrey, Esthner Friesner, C. J. Cherryh and, of course, the woman who started it all, Leslie Fish.<br />Why would anyone have 19 stories and a song about Carmen Miranda's ghost on a space station? SF writers having fun would have to be my main interpretation.  And that's no bad thing, there are some brilliant stories within this anthology, some hysterical giggles, some thought provoking moments, and even some bittersweet memories. For the filksong fans, the sheet music for the song that Leslie Fish wrote is included at the end of the anthology. In some ways, I guess I'd say that this is sort of an in-joke anthology, since the folks most likely to pick it up are fans, but I highly reccomend it to any SF or Fantasy reader!  Here's just a bit of Leslie's song:<br />&quot;Carmen Miranda's Ghost is haunting<br />  Space Station Three.<br />Half the staff has seen her,<br />  plus the Portmaster and me.<br />And if you think we've had too much<br />Of Cookie's homemade rum,<br />Just tell me where these basket hats<br />  of fruit keep coming from!&quot;<br />Happy reading! ^_^ shanshadan in-joke anthology, since the folks most likely to pick it up are fans, but I highly reccomend it to any SF or Fantasy reader!

The premise of the story is a boy who discovers that his grandfather is a magician.  Sam causes a spell that his grandfather is working on to go awry and his grandfather disappears, leaving it up to Sam to get him back.  In order to do so, Sam must confront some things about himself and begin to discover who he really is.<br />This was published in 1979, long before Harry Potter was even dreamed up--it does offer an interesting look into a young boy suddenly faced with the existence of magic and the consequences of it.  The writing is adequate and the story is engaging.  There are some black and white sketches scattered throughout the book which might help to ease in a new reader who is moving from picture books into chapter books.  That said, the book is definately dated, and may make it difficult for 9-12 yr. olds to identify with. The expressions and the clothing aren't anywhere near contemporary. The author's particular bias against television and it's tendency to stunt the imagination is hardly subtle--while I do not mind the sentiment, it can get to be too much at times. Also the cover on this particular edition is pretty poor, and doesn't do anything for the story.<br />Perhaps the biggest flaw to this story is any comparison to Harry Potter, or other young wizard series that have cropped up in recent years.  Taken in comparison, the writing is not as good, at times it's downright awkward. I wouldn't reccomend this to a young reader who's already read Harry Potter, but it may be a good start for a young reader prior to Harry. I gave this book three stars because I think it deserves that merit of being published at a time when there were few books on this theme.  I encountered it, read it, and thoroughly enjoyed it at the time, but I admit I now have it in my collection because of my fond memories--it doesn't read as well since I've grown up.<br />^_^ Happy Reading! shanshad	2002-05-19

The title sounds like one of those headlines you might read off a tabloid.  The cover is silly and strange, and its supposed to be. Because this is a SF anthology devoted to tabloid tales, the kinds of stories we always hear or read about but never take seriously.  Beyond the garish cover and title, are some suprisingly good and some suprisingly funny short stories. Then again, with Martin Greenberg and Esthner M. Friesner teaming up to edit this anthology, maybe not so surprising.<br />There are thirty six stories to choose from, some by well recognized authors such as Alan Dean Foster, Harry Turtledove, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Mike Resnick and Jody Lynn Nye.  As with all anthologies, the quality of the stories varies, but there are some real delights in here. \\"2,437 UFOs Over New Hampshire\\" by Allen Steele gives a look into the lives of whole town of \\"alien abductee\\".  \\"Is Your Coworker a Space Alien?\\" by \\"Bob\\" bes Shahar is a hysterical look into the workplace and the 'normal' folk that inhabit it.<br />This isn't the serious side of SF, but these tales can still make you think.  They have fun extrapolating on the impossible. Elvis clones, aliens, bigfoot, all the kind of things that you look at in the local tabloid and think \\"yeah, right.\\"  It's appeal is the strange, the idiosyncratic and the screwball. If you enjoy reading scandal sheets, or just want a book that doesn't take itself seriously, this might be just the anthology to curl up with.  Just watch out that those pesky aliens don't make off with your chocolate chip cookies!...	2002-05-18

New readers are recommended to find the earlier books in this series if possible or at least find out what the backstory is before reading this volume.  There is a paragraph in the opening of the manga that gives a summary of what happened in the last volume, but the summary still assumes that the reader knows who Miyu and Larva are and the backstory that surrounds them.<br />For those new to Vampire Miyu, this series started with Vampire Princess Miyu manga in which an eternally young girl vampire and her shinma servant must return the evil shinma (demons) to the dark.  These are bittersweet tales about love, regret and death.  The artwork is subtley beautiful and evocative.<br />New Vampire Miyu is a spin-off from the original works that details Miyu's adventures in the realm of the shinma themselves.  There is war brewing between the eastern and western shinma, and Miyu is facing some deadly enemies. There are quite a few more characters to remember and political alliances to keep track of than the original series.  There's more action and physical battles than in the original series.  Nevertheless, the tone remains decidedly bittersweet and romantic.  <BR>The series very serious, without much humor.  This probably won't appeal to the manga reader who likes a lot of mecha or violent action.  Readers who enjoy this might also like Clover, which is another beautifully poetic manga series.  My strongest suggestion with this book is to find the earlier volumes, it will make reading this book much more enjoyable.<br />Happy reading!<BR>shanshad ^_^	2002-05-05

The main character of both series is an eternally young girl named Miyu who is a vampire and is fated to send all shimna (demons) out of the human world and back into the dark.  She has one shimna, Larva as her faithful servant. The original series deals with Miyu's battling shinma in the human world.  The New Vampire Miyu spin-off has to do with the shinma world itself and Miyu's battle against the evil shinma of that world.<br />The artwork is lovely and powerful--not as ornate as CLAMP's style but subtly beautiful.  The stories here are not humorous, and can be very bittersweet.  The Shinma Wars that are covered in New Vampire Miyu tend to be more action oriented than the original series, with a quite a few different characters to remember. At times it can be confusing to keep track of everyone.  Those who like mecha, lots of violence and action, or \\"adult situations\\" in their manga won't find these elements here.  This is nothing like the style of Vampire Hunter D.<br />If you can, I suggest finding the earlier volumes of Vampire Princess Miyu--most of these are not available in English, but the first volume is now available.  This should help readers to have a clearer grasp of the storyline as it progresses. These can be a worthwhile read, but they are much more enjoyable with the whole story to back them up. Most of the original story is also available now on DVD,and if you enjoy this manga you may wish to check out the anime.<br />Happy reading!<br />shanshad	2002-04-26

Or SF Poetry from Ray Bradbury	To my knowledge this veteran author of SF and Fantasy classics has written three books of true poetry, although many of his stories have a lyrical quality that comes to poetry.  His first collection; WHEN ELEPHANTS LAST IN THE DOORYARD BLOOMED I haven't been able to find, but this collection, and his third book of poetry,THE HAUNTED COMPUTER AND THE ANDROID POPE. This exploration in verse by Bradbury is fascinating and enjoyable, especially for those who are Bradbury fans to begin with.<br />I will not claim Bradbury to be the most brilliant poet, but there are many gems among these pages.  &quot;Byzantium I Come Not From&quot; is a wonderful example of the richness of memory and boyhood  summers.  His subject matter ranges from childhood memories to popular movies.  From heartbreak to The Nefertiti-Tut Express. From ghosts to rocketships and robots.  The author brings his lyrical skills, love of sound and word to these themes and more. Anyone who has read Bradbury's books will recognize his themes from books expanded in verse.<br />For anyone who is a wonderer, with a fascination in the what if? the macabre, the fantastic worlds of paranormal side by side scientific and the melding of all these elements, if you can discover a copy of this, read and enjoy. There's nothing quite like them I've found anywhere else.	2002-04-04

Each page features one letter of the alphabet rendered by Chris in black and white drawings that are marvellously compelling.  On the opposite page is a one line description of what is happening to the letter.  For example, the \\"G\\" is depicted with leaves and thorns poking out of it, with the phrase on the corresponding page stating \\"The G was starting to grow.\\"<br />This book elegantly conveys the entire alphabet with pictures and few words.  Despite it's appearance of simplicity, adults may well find this picture book as engaging as children do.  I consider this book to be perfect for children learning the alphabet.  It's a fundamental part of many of the nursery school classes I have encountered.  The large pictures and simple sentences allow large groups of children to see the letters from a distance.  After one or two readings, children will be calling out the words before the parent or teacher does.  I have yet to encounter a class that doesn't delightfully chime in with \\"And the Z was finally Zapped!\\" at the end...	2002-03-29
US	42584545	R2BMYHELLSGS87	0552527521	273057613	The Carpet People	Books	4	13	13	N	N	A look at Pratchett's Early Work	Many readers are familiar with Terry Pratchett's Discworld series and its delicious range of unforgettable characters, satirical creations and dialogue and thought-provoking themes. Less known are his earlier works, including The Carpet People, which Pratchett first wrote as a teenager and had published, then went back to years later and rewrote the book to reflect his change in viewpoint.<br />The Carpet People feels more like a children's, or young adult story, although if it can be found, it will often be placed with Pratchett's Discworld titles in the fantasy section. The story is a delightful bit of imagination, entire societies coexisting within the world of the Carpet. These tiny creatures go about adventure on the epic scale, with Pratchett's typical ironic observations and humorous interpretations. Our hero, Snibril has to set out on a quest to save a kingdom from enemies and to stop the destruction of a force known only as The Fray.<br />This is not one of Pratchett's most seamless works by a long shot. I don't think he intended it to be.  A lot of the themes and world-building elements he puts into practice for this work are later fulfilled with much more skill and elegance in his Discworld novels and Bromeliad trilogy.  For any Pratchett fan, this book is a delight simply from its standpoint in the evolution of Pratchett's writing.<br />I gave this book four stars because I do not feel it is Pratchett's best work. It shouldn't be, this story was one of his earliest.  This is a wonderful way to introduce younger readers to Pratchett, along with his Bromeliad trilogy.  If you are discovering Terry Pratchett with this book, be aware that his writing only gets better from here! ^_^	2002-03-11

On the surface this is a wonderful story about the young country bunny pursuing her dream of becoming an Easter Bunny and succeeding.  Children will identify with the legend of the Easter Bunny and the eggs they bring to children around the world. Like Rudolph the reindeer in Christmas stories, the country bunny takes her place in the ranks of illustrious legend.  Despite the mockery of those deemed \\"better\\" than her by rabbit society, (rich, powerful male rabbits) she perserveres. It is also a story that I could reccomend for Mother's Day, as this is also a story about a mother and her children and how they teach each other. While somewhat dated, I think this is one legend that touches the heart and will last.  The pictures are simple illustrations that feel similar to the artwork of Peter Rabbit, but nevertheless communicate the story effectively.  And may every mother have her own pair of \\"golden shoes\\". ^_^	2002-03-08

The music is created by the use of the musical spheres that the adults \\"snag\\" and the more control and spheres an adult can control, the more powerful he or she is.  Thrown into this world are two misunderstood young people--Caidrun, a mercurial girl who has been an outcast since before she was born, and Tamborel, the boy who has steadfastedly remained her best friend.<br />This book makes for a wonderfully emotional coming of age story of these two protagonists.  What the author does best is to create that emotional relationship that exists between Tamborel and Caidrun.  The understanding and the value of friendship is appealing--this book will most likely interest sensitive young teens who are exploring facets of emotional interaction and enjoy fantasy settings.<br />Those who prefer action, or more complex world building may feel this story drags at times, and the story rather simplistic. There are many aspects of this world that are never expanded upon, and the characters other than the story's two protagonists never become fully realized. The adventures of Tamborel, therefore, come across as lackluster. And most of Caidrun's adventures are skipped over entirely.  Had the author spent some time on Caidrun's experiences from her POV, it might have made the story stronger.<br />Still, I very much enjoy this book for what it is. I am glad to have it in my collection.	2002-02-11

The author proves himself very adept at word use, world-building and storytelling in an amazingly rich story.<br />The young female protagonist of this story lives in a peaceful valley that has remained sheilded for generations from the depredations of those who live on either side of the valley.  But when the magical defenses begin to fail, it is up to Tilja, her grandmother and a young man and his grandfather (along with one ornery horse) to venture beyond the valley and seek the one person who might help them.<br />The bare bones plot is not new, but this author is a master--he handles the adventure of these four and brings the tale full circle with care and precision.  The images are powerful and for anyone who recognizes the power of stories, the author's underlying message will ring true.<br />Being a YA book there is some limit to the adult reader who might desire an adult protagonist, or more mature themes explored that are not dealt with in this story.  Beyond that, I highly reccomend this book to any fantasy reader as an example of high caliber story telling.  Enjoy!	2002-01-20

A reporter sent to look into the death of a dragon quickly discovers there are dark plots at work behind the dragon's death--and quickly winds up in over his head. There are some unexpected twists and turns, startling betrayals and underhanded motives at play. If you enjoyed Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden books, this story will probably appeal. Melisa Michaels' paranormal mysteries dealing with a female detective duo and elven invegstigations are fairly similar in style.  There is more focus on the unfolding events and the mystery itself than on the more emotional or romantic elements that some other urban fantasies contain. Those looking for a strongly magical plot may be disappointed.  The author's use of fantasy is fairly matter-of-fact and more like his SF roots. I did feel there were a few plot threads left hanging--but it was all in all a good read.  It has the earmarks of a possible series, and I wouldn't be surprised to see our reporter hero back again.	2002-01-09

If you are looking for lots of action, lots of physical sensuality and a harder, 90's type heroine--you won't find her here.  Despite that, this is a book I've read cover to cover so often my copy is falling apart. Mercedes Lackey has in this book what she does so well in her best writing, character vulnerability and sensitivity.  Diana Tregarde is a mystical guardian trying to figure out her own identity and emotions. Readers who enjoyed the Last Herald Mage series will likely enjoy this book. YA readers can be reccommended this as a precursor to the more adult vampire fiction out currently. To be honest, this more a book about understanding and character growth than it is about vamps, magic, or things that go bump in the night. Sometimes the heart themes may overwhelm the action, but that is the more important focus of the books, just as the erotic elements in Hamilton's novels tend to be kept in the foreground.  Particular readers will respond to each. In any case, I love both Hamilton and Huff, but this remains my favorite book.	2001-12-06

Dresden's first person narrative keep this story full of dry humor and film noir feel.<br />  Dresden is a PI/wizard who's middle name is trouble. This time his supernatural snafu is a ghostly being that is able to rouse other ghosts and harm Dresden's friends.  It's up to the only wizard in town to discover who's behind it all.<br />  This series has been pegged as similar to Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series, and on the surface, that's a fair comparison. Both deal with urban societies and parnormal baddies. Both have a tough edge, supernatural powers, and a penchant for violence. Both have a tough time in their love lives.  That being said, Jim Butcher's novel has a distinctly male flavor to it.  There is far less relationship time and sensitivity, more interest in action, gadgets and intrigue--this is not a bad thing, but the overall result is you care about the characters less (they're distanced) and you have more interest in the mechanics of the supernatural. Those who enjoy Butcher's books might want to try STALKING THE UNICORN by Mike Resnick, about a gumshoe who gets hired by goblin to find a kidnapped unicorn.  For those who like both Hamilton and Butcher, I also reccomend Tanya Huff's Vampire series.  There a tough lady PI teams up with a romance-writing vampire to hunt down some supernatural baddies.<br />I'm intrigued to see where Dresden's story is going.  Perhaps my biggest gripe with the whole book was that at the end the hero appears to be in deeper problems than he was at the beginning and I want to know what happens. But, that's the curse of series books...guess I'll just have to wait for the next one.	2001-12-06

The one by the second grade class seems to have missed the particular theme of this book and the second claims the story is predictable.  Well, in a way, it is predictable.  The grandmother's death is an inevitable event, and dealing with that death and loss is a story every child must deal with in their lives. The young girl in this book reacts with horror to the thought of losing her grandmother--and even tries to fight it--keep it from happening.  In the end, she comes to an understanding and an acceptance of what death means and finds new strength for herself and her family. This is a wonderful book for those children who are dealing with the question of death in their own lives.	2001-12-04

Whatever I was expecting when I cracked this book open, it wasn't this! I keep wanting to compare it to The Princess Bride, except it is not a book with tongue in cheek humor and satire.  It is a book about kingdoms, the price of power and leadership and those who struggle to bring about good in a dangerous world. Victoria Hanley does an impressive job of showing readers the tactics and political maneuvers of warfare and diplomacy, but doesn't bog this book down in extraneous detail or explanation. The characters are strong and capable, with interesting reflections on male/female roles in the struggle. Hanley gives power to both roles--and creates characters that act outside the roles they were given. There is a sense of completness in this story--no teasers leading into a miniseries which allows the reader to enjoy this book all on its own.<br />Readers interested by Tamora Peirce's Lionness series and Robin McKinley's Damar Duology should definately give this new author a try!	2001-11-28

Reluctant heroes, a group of unusual comrades sent on a quest to save the land from darkness, ancient prophesies and magics coming to light to both help and hinder our protagonists. Like Tolkien, I feel as though the author of this work is more fastened to the world she has created than to the characters.  Her world is full of depth and detail, fantastic elements and mighty heroes and villains. Epic in all truth of the word. This is an enjoyable book, especially to fill in travel time or pass the time.<br />I only give it three stars, however because while this is good, it does not quite reach great. I did not become attached enough to the characters truly care about them, other than Lysandra.  Renan and Talog remain mostly a mystery.  Even when the viewpoint shifts to theirs, its almost indistinguishable from Lysandra's.  We see these characters as valiant, heroic, suffering and troubled. We don't see the little things that connect us to them as real people--they feel like they've been summoned out of the woodwork for this, no connections, no friends. People tend to be either good or bad, which is typical for epic fantasy, but at times here they seem over simplified. Perhaps the most interesting character is Aurya. The author has gone to a lot of work to create an interesting, complex villianess with her own motivations and conflicts.  She is one of the most interesting characters to follow in the whole of this book, perhaps moreso because she is one of the most active participants in it, determined to shape her own destiny. The author has crafted a good story, but I don't feel like I love our protagonists, or feel their suffering in the way I could.<br />For those of you reading this book, be aware this is only the first book in what is likely a trilogy. In credit to the author, the book does not end on a cliffhanger, but at a lull in the adventure, so that its clear there is more story, but this particular quest has reached a satisfying conclusion point. As I have said, good but not great. Especially enjoyable for those who like epic fantasy and world-building in their stories, but may be frustrating for those who desire to identify closely with the characters.ts clear there is more story, but this particular quest has reached a satisfying conclusion point.

I didn't want to like it, especially since I hadn't liked any of the other dreary books we'd read that year.  But this is a brilliant book, and I have to admit I liked it.  This is no pleasant dream of the future.  Like 1984 and Animal Farm, and even Lord of the Flies, this book takes a look at the darker side of humankind.  What happens when capitalism becomes a religion and human beings are created in a lab?  Where sex and drugs are the cultural rule and reading Shakespeare is taboo? It's a chilling picture, despite the outdated technology and references. It gives us a look at the dark side of capitalism as well as the power of words and symbols over the human mind.  It's brilliant, provoking, frightening and unforgettable.	2001-11-01

Harry (Angharad is her real name) is a young woman who is restless, out of place in her world.  But when the king of the Hillfolk abducts her, she is thrown into a world of magic and adventure and required to prove herself.  This is an excellent book for young teen readers who want to sink their teeth into some excellent sword and sorcery fantasy adventure.  For those already well immersed and drawn to the darker fantasy, this book may seem a little too bland, but I think it's an excellent book for the age group. A little romantic? Sure! But that's part of the fun.  Readers who enjoy this have to catch Mckinely's Beauty and the Beast retellings and THE HERO AND THE CROWN.

But living in NYC right now I find it difficult to look at some of the ruthless mindsets created in this book. There is a strong level of violence and cold praticality in this book that ring true for the kind of story the author's creating.  There is pain and triumph, victory and defeat--all very powerful, but this is not a light work and I admit I couldn't quite deal with the darkness of the plot.  I also didn't find that I could identify strongly with any of the characters.  The entirety of the plot remained a little to distanced for me to do that.

I've kept up with the series from the time I first discovered them, and I find them truly wonderful, refreshing reads.  But NIC was a bit disappointing for me. As much as sexy vamps and furries are great reading candy, I need a stronger balance of plot and character. This was a little more like Kiss of Shadows for me than any of the others. Basically, Anita is surrounded by droolworthy guys and keeps deciding who she's going to make love to.  This didn't prevent me from reading the book in one night, and I still enjoyed it--but there's a lot less character depth being explored here.  There's mostly more of what we've seen in other books.  I still encourage fans to read it, but if you're new to the series, start with the first few books before diving in here.

This book gently tells, in story and fable, the healing words of how to carry on and what it is to live, and why we need to remember.  Any parent or child old enough to understand death can take comfort and healing from this story.  I wish I had a hundred copies of this to give to all of my friends who have lost someone.

The short story mix just wasn't up to par with the kind of variety MZB usually had, and I honestly felt dissatisfied with more than one story.  Unfortunately, I don't have the volume with me, so I can't elaborate by title. There were a few gems among the stories &quot;Raven Wings on the Snow&quot; was by far and away my favorite.  It's a wonderful retelling of the Seven Swans that does the fairy tale justice.<br />Maybe I'm mourning the loss of MZB and therefore haven't gotten past that point yet, but I don't think this is the best of S&amp;S by a long shot.  For those of you who are curious about these anthologies, try to find one of the earlier volumes before trying this one.  I won't discourage you from buying this one, anthologies are great because there is such a range of stories, but for a better taste of the classic S&amp;S, the older ones are best.	2001-09-10

It's not your usual fantasy by any stretch, and may not appeal to everyone, but if your looking for something different then this might be just the book for you.  There's certainly room for the author to grow--as already observed, her male characters tend to be over-simplified when compared with their female counterparts. And for those who haven't read it, this has the violence and retribution feel of the old fairy tales--in other words, there's blood and death and fairly little sparkly fairy dust. However, that's the only way I'll compare this book with fairy tales. The story and setting are refreshingly different and the style gives it an ethnic flavor that will appeal to those searching for multicultural fantasy. Women looking for different roles in their fantasy novels will find them here.  Not for everyone, certainly. But a welcome addition to a small, but growing genre.	2001-09-05

I really identified with the characters in this book, perhaps because most of them are around my age and living in a similar area to where I live.  This is a well told, emotional and complex tale of an elf-lord in NYC and the treasure he must find. The ending sticks in my memory. (I won't spoil it here for those who haven't read this yet.) This book appealed to me more than the others in this series, I enjoyed finding out what happened later on. By the way--anyone who reads this will recognize the Babylon nursery rhyme reference, try checking out Deep Secret by Diana Wynne Jones.<br />Okay, that being said, this book struck me with a strong sense of deja-vu. Many years ago I encountered a book called THE GLOVE OF MAIDEN'S HAIR.  The book, by Michael Friedman, is about an elf-lord magically transported to a modern-day city. He's the one who rescues the heroine from muggers, but there is a lot of this story that parallels. The style and the emotional quality and the actual stories themselves are very different, but if you liked this you might want to see if you can find a copy of THE GLOVE OF MAIDEN'S HAIR, it's a little dated, but worth a read.	2001-09-05

I have no objection to alternative POV Pullman creates here, I don't believe it--but it'd be a shame if everyone only wrote about the things I believe in. I enjoyed the story for its literary skill and Pullman's own theories on creation. My problem is that I wasn't looking for this in the series. The first book was about Lyra--her adventures and her perceptions. The second book still focused on Lyra but a larger scope of people were introduced and suddenly it became more about the story than the people. By the third, Lyra's become lost in the war of ideas and theories being crafted. I missed having the more traditional story here. That being said, its an amazing book--but its not for everybody. It offers a different religious view--one set against Christianity and focusing on a very different set of values. It's interesting and good to get a different take on things, but not everybody's going to like it, and less are going to agree with it. My best advice to readers, don't beware--but BE AWARE that this is not a sweet or simple fantasy that will leave all questions answered.	2001-08-29

I picked it up in the bookstore, started to leaf through and found myself hooked into the story. The narrator and main character of this book tells in powerful detail what its like to be an outcast . . . and to have a painful secret that's destroying you from the inside out. I don't read many books outside the fantasy/sf genre, but this is a book I would highly reccomend whatever genre you may normally read. It's a look at the high school world that young people can identify with. It is not a sweet or happy story, instead it's a powerful mosaic of light and shadow that takes hold of you and doesn't easily let go. Find it, read it and treasure it!	2001-08-27
US	42584545	R1Q578OENLLI9S	0140321667	912095423	The Lost Star	Books	5	4	4	N	N	A good SF coming of age story.	A young woman suddenly stranded on a backwater world with a team of scientists must rethink her priorities and her plans for the future when a mysterious group of alien creatures try to communicate with her. I kind of consider this to be a young teen's version of &quot;Little Fuzzy&quot; by H. Beam Piper. I really loved this story when I was younger and snared it for my collection early on. It's an underdog story with a happy-ending, but it has enough drama and serious issues that it doesn't come across as sweet and sacharine. For young readers of SF, particularly those who like the human side to the genre, I highly reccomend this book if you can find it. It's a great introduction to planetary exploration and alien races.	2001-08-24

Any one who enjoys seeing the world through the eyes of these not-so-usual cats can find something to sink their claws into here.  There's SF, there's fantasy, humor, drama . . . almost any style you could wish for.  Not all the stories will appeal to everyone, but the collection offers the reader a buffet of good choices with quality stories.  I admit, I liked the second anthology slightly better, but &quot;Critical Cats&quot; had me seriously teary eyed. The fun of an anthology is that these are short stories and you can pick one to read anytime! It's my favorite travel reading!	2001-08-23
US	42584545	R2ZTL3MO25KXT8	0888783612	262563215	Brother Jonathan	Books	4	5	7	N	N	One of My Favorites . . .	This book crafts a chilling picture of what capitalism out-of-control could be like in a future world.  It's one of the earlier SF novels I read and it has most of the elements I like to see in this genre.  For those who like humanism in their SF, I would reccomend this novel.  In the future, massive corporations rule the world in place of countries.  They routinely try to outbid each other and declare war on one another in takeover attempts.  Thrown into this struggle are a group of neurologically handicapped children and animals who are at the bottom of the pecking order.  They're to be the guinea pigs for a new computer implants that the scientists hope will rebuild the damaged areas of their brains.  What actually happens is beyond everyones expectations . . .  Suffice to say, this is a story about the triumph of the underdog and the changing of a world.  The only downside is that this book makes a pat ending out of something that couldn't be that simple, in an otherwise enjoyable book, it's forgivable, but I feel like a lot more could be done along this theme.  If you like this and want something more complex try Tad Williams' Otherland books, their big but worth reading.	2001-08-23

I agree with Kristin Silverman, I've been saying for years how this charming book would make a wonderful movie.  I'm so weary of fairy tale stories--even modern ones, that have to have the beautiful heroine with the long tresses, wonderful figure--and heaven forbid one of them have freckles! I've loved Amy since the first time I read this book--almost 15 years ago. This book gives the girl with the gumption and spirit--rather than the looks, the best happily ever after there is!	2001-08-23

A young girl makes a wish in a river--and gets a surprising answer. Together, three people must work to save NYC from a monstrous kraken that has worn down the protections of the city.  This is a heart warming story with plenty of teary-eyed moments.  I started this series with the second book, but this is my favorite of the three.  It's a coming of age story, with adventure and magic mixed in. For those girls who've read Harry Potter and want something a little older and more female focused, this might be just your thing.	2001-08-23

I read this series out of order years ago, starting with Mind Find, then Mind Hold and finally scouring libraries for Mind Call.  This is a gripping psychic talents series about young teens and children coming to terms with the powers they posess and the world around them. I honestly wish they'd reprint these books--if you have copies of these books or can find them at your public library, consider yourself lucky. I really reccommend them to anyone who has ever felt themselves to be &quot;different&quot; (doesn't just about everybody?) But they're hard to find and expensive to buy.  With all the success with Harry Potter and the Roswell TV series I think somebody should consider putting them back on the shelves for another generation to enjoy.	2001-08-14

And I have to say its one of those stories that is so enjoyable and so imaginative that it belongs in any serious fantasy collection.  Sophie and Howl are some of the most lovable--and most human fantasy characters I've run into in a long time.  When I read this at twelve, I must admit the romance arc of the story completely missed me, now it's one of my favorite parts of the book.  For those not familiar with Diana Wynne Jones or with most British based literature, the style is a little denser than Harry Potter and may take more work to get into, but its worth the effort, believe me.	2001-08-14

Anyone who enjoys stories about misfit kids with special powers should try this one.  Basically a group of kids and teens are gathered by scientists who are out to discover different kinds of psychic talents. But when one of their number is kidnapped by mysterious men, the kids run away in the attempt to rescue her and to discover the truth behind the scientist's research. Are they trying to help?
