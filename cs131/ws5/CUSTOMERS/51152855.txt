On the other hand, if you're looking for a little something to pass the time, this one may do the trick.    The main character receives the news that she has fibroid tumors and may need surgery.  Fibroids are so incredibly commonplace among African-American women that I had difficulty taking seriously all of the drama the ensued as a result of her diagnosis.  One would think that she had received news that she had a life-threatening illness.  But minimal drama in a solid, God-fearing household is something of a literary anomaly these days.  Adding to Lynnette's struggles with her health, is the sudden need for the comfort of her birth mother, who deserted her when she was very young.    A good, solid, clean novel.   A sarcastic thanks to BayBBlaze for managing to ruin the entire story with the second sentence of her review.  Please be more considerate of folks who are just looking for an opinion on the story/novel, without revelations of critical storylines.        DYB	2005-08-30

Angela Toussaint has nothing but warm, wonderful memories of her grandmother Marie, and summers at the Good House.

Being the powerful priestess that she was, she was able to put the demon to sleep....where it has lay dormant within the earth of the Good House all of these years.  Returning to the small town of Sacajawea, Washington with her son Cory as she has done many times before, a simple task of cleaning the attic has sparked young Corey's curiosity in his grandmother; and before you know it, he is pouring through her book of spells and trying some of her magic.

Genevieve Forbes is an accomplished businesswoman with a doctorate in her field.  She is beautiful and smart, but leaves her husband wanting in the bedroom.  She says she loves him, but she seems only able to perform her marital \\"duties,\\" leaving her spouse feeling inadequate as a lover, and subconsciously looking for passion elsewhere.  Elsewhere appears in the form of the gorgeous Kenya, when his wife is summoned home to Alabama as the result of the death of her grandmother.  Kenya is young and uninhibited, and the husband of Dr. Forbes finds her impossible to resist.  But this southern journey also affords this husband a glimpse into his wife's past; a past that is so filled with abuse and neglect that it has continued to impact her life and the way that she loves in the physical sense. <br />What her husband soon finds out is that this in no way affects her ability to love him from her soul. <br /> <br />Filled with secrets, drama, and the author's poetic prose that we've come to know so well, Genevieve is a beautiful story that forces us to examine our closest relationships and what we view as important. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2005-05-10

I started with A Killing Game, which I believe to be the second in the Eve Duncan series...not realizing there was a prequel.  This is the first of the series, and readers are introduced to Eve Duncan--forensic sculptor extraordinaire.  She is struggling to accept the death of her daughter Bonnie at the hands of a serial killer.  It is a struggle for Eve because her \\"work\\" is to bring the dead to \\"life\\" enough for them to be identified and brought home to their loved ones; while coming to the grips with the knowledge that her very own Bonnie may never be able to do the same.  In this tale, Eve has been sought out by John Logan, a handsome billionaire businessman.  He needs Eve to reconstruct a mysterious skull.  Although Eve specializes on children, John makes her an offer that the cannot refuse..and she is drawn into a web of deceit and intrigue with stakes so high that Eve at first finds all impossible to believe.  Deception and murder revolving around the Oval Office?  And the perpetrators themselves are above reproach, which means that no one can be trusted..... <br /> <br />A decent mystery and suspense novel, I just found this intro to Eve Duncan disappointing.

In another amazing piece of work from this author, readers are drawn into the lives of the Rose women....beginning with sisters Velma and Maggie.  Velma, the eldest, is the plain jane of the two; Maggie, although blessed with beauty, is definitely lacking in the brains department.  The beautiful, naive Maggie is seduced by Velma's boyfriend Lloyd, and caught in the act.  Velma is filled with anger and an incredible sense of betrayal; Maggie, of course is unaware of any wrongdoing (\\"but we were just loving, Velma, like the animals do\\").  Their father, however, meets with Lloyd and the decision is made that he will marry Maggie.  Lloyed genuinely loves Maggie, and Maggie loves Lloyd (that's all she knows to do), and all is well (Velma moves on and marries someone of her own) until tragedy strikes...leaving Maggie widowed, scarred, forever mourning her beloved Lloyd and changing the course of their lives forever.  Life finds Velma raising her children, with husband Chuck, and then raising her children's children, all the while struggling to make ends meet.  Maggie lives with Velma also--forever mentally and physically scarred by a tragedy long ago.  But Velma's biggest cross to bear throughout this tale is Audrey Rose--beloved child who grows up to love a monster, court the \\"white lady\\" and all of the evils that accompany that addiction, and abandon her child--the lovely Camilla Rose.  Raised by her grandparents, like the rest of her cousins, Camilla grows up viewing her blackness as a cross to bear...and associates that with everything negative in her life; poverty, her mother's heroin addiction, sickness, joblessness and the like.  Subconsciously, Camilla's goal is to leave it all behind....she leaves for college, concocts a fictitious past, lightens her skin, and abandons her family.  She marries light, has a child, and almost manages to leave it all behind...until she is confronted with a family legacy that may seek to claim her life. <br /> <br />Wonderfully constructed, Ms. McFadden's work flows much like poetry.

At an especially vulnerable time in his life, the married woman that he is servicing gives him a down payment of 15K for offing her husband.  But Driver isn't as hard as his past and his persona leads one to believe; he meets the husband, forms a bond, and begins working for him instead.  Wifey is furious, and the story is off and running.  She wants to continue their relationship...and when he refuses, she demands her money back.  And of course he cannot oblige, and the clock begins ticking.  Not your typical ignored rich wife, Lisa is also an ex-LAPD officer with lots of connections--legit and otherwise.

Bishop \\"Chicken\\" Johnson is an amateur boxer born to prostitute Dimples and her beloved pimp, Slim Willie.  When both are killed in a burglary, Bishop does time for killing one of the perpetrators.  Upon his release, he spends some time with hated Uncle Ike, until he is rescued by a loving elderly couple who are raising their grandson Malcolm.  Malcolm and Bishop quickly become as close as brothers, while Poppa Daddy and Bishop share a love for boxing...and Poppa Daddy begins to cultivate Bishop's amazing natural talent.  However, this is  still rural Alabama, and when Chicken goes up again the town troublemaker in the ring who happens to be white and gives him a long overdue beatdown, trouble ensues.  At Poppa Daddy's urging and with the help of the town sheriff, Bishop leaves town and joins the Peace Corps...and begins a new life overseas.  In Kenya, Bishop meets a beautiful African woman named Abeni, who has had a troubled life of her own.  The two fall in love, and have a daughter that they name Hundiata; and it is not long before the childhood demons that haunt Abeni come calling, this time for their beloved Hunni.  Bishop must then make one of the most difficult choices of his life. <br /> <br />This was truly one of the best books that I have ever read, and I would recommend it to all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2005-02-12

The concept was great....though in my opinion the novel never developed to its full potential.   <br /> <br />The story centers mainly on Helen and Michael Drager, Manhattanites with one daughter, Zoe.  Zoe is a student in one of the elite private Manhattan schools; however, she's about to enter the 8th grade and so the chase begins to get her into yet another elite, private, high school.  The School (as it's called where Zoe is currently enrolled) is run by Pamela Rothschild, a woman who is both hated and feared, with a questionable history/background.  Helen is President of the Parent's Association, and it also best friends with Sarah Nash, The School's admissions director.  What follows is a story about the ridiculous lengths to which parents will go to ensure that their little tykes receive a \\"quality\\" education--that of course can only be had in private schools to the tune of 20K annually. <br /> <br />The Pamela Rothschild character, witch that she was, could have made this novel a lot more fun if we'd seen more of her.  Helen Drager could have actually had an affair with the sexy Phillip Cashin--leading to even more drama.  And I probably would have liked the Sarah Nash character if she had been developed a bit more.  All in all, a lot of smoke but not enough fire.  Disappointing. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2005-02-06

Bernice Mcfadden has written another masterpiece which draws the reader into the violent life of young Kenzie Lowe, and her brother Malcolm.  Her world is full of darkness...shadows spread by her father, Hy-Lo.  The author does an excellent job of taking the reader from from the present of the adult Kenzie--where she begins her vigil at her father's deathbed--to the past of the child, and her ugly memories.  Kenzie's memories are nothing pleasant; her father was an alcoholic, and a violent one.  Her childhood memories were of walking on eggshells around her father, never quite sure what would ignite the flame of the dragon that lived within him.  Hy-Lo routinely beat Kenzie's mother Della, and brother Malcolm.  None were spared; especially painful is the recollection of the death of her beloved cat Priscilla at her father's hand. <br /> <br />Now an adult, Kenzie must deal with her own struggles with the bottle, and come to terms with everything that she has been through.  Kenzie has never referred to her father as Dad and has never held love in her heart for him.  But the bedside vigils lead to a conversation with Nurse Dianne, an old childhood friend of Hy-Lo and his brothers, who sheds some light on Hy-Lo's own troubled childhood at the hand of his cruel mother Gwyneth.  Through Dianne, Kenzie is finally able to see her father as something other then the victimizer that he had been to her and her family, and can perhaps reach beneath all of the hate that she feels for him to find at least a little compassion. <br /> <br />Difficult material, but one cannot not help but love the writing of this author.  If nothing else, Ms. McFadden is never one to shy away from difficult subject matter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2005-01-22

He is also running for borough president.  But you know what they say about the preacher's kids....they are rarely saints themselves. <br /> <br />Oldest son Dante is fresh out of a relationship with vixen Anita--10 years his senior and the church secretary.  Anita is his first love, but his heart is broken when she choose stability over passion, and marries the one-armed Deacon Emerson--an older man with money.  Dante eventually meets Tanisha, who is from the wrong side of the tracks, of whom he knows his mother would never approve...but to Dante, she is a breath of fresh air.  He wants to move on with his life, but despite her marriage to the Deacon, Anita is not having it.  She is obsessed with Dante, who she professes to be \\"her man.\\"  How will Dante get away from Anita...and what secrets is Tanisha hiding? <br /> <br />Youngest daughter Donna is in love with the handsome Terrance Reynolds, who has taken her virginity.  Although she believes he loves her also, he has yet to say the words and insists that she keep their relationship a secret...for now.  But when circumstances underscore the need for them to take their relationship to the next level, Donna gets a nasty shock...Terrance may not be the man that he appears to be.  And she must do the unthinkable to save face..... <br /> <br />Although the siblings are completely aware throughout the story of their family's standing in the community, their father's political career, and the need at all times to preserve their family's name, there are secrets to be uncovered.  For even the infallible Bishop and the perfectly upstanding First Lady may have a few secrets of their own that they would prefer stay just that...secrets. <br /><br />This may quite possibly be my favorite Carl Weber novel to date.

This is a book that takes you into the life of young Michael Fraser, who after committing robbery and murder at the tender age of 15 finds himself in an adult maximum security prison to serve out the term of his sentence.  He is taken under the wing of the resident Moslems who run the place, and all is well for a number of years.  He converts to Islam, but only for convenience sake, correctly recognizing that ingratiating himself with the group will afford him protection within the prison walls.  But there is one cardinal rule that leader Mustafa insist that all of the brothers follow; that you are strong, and do not engage in any sexual anomalies.  Michael is fine with this initially...but years go by and hormones kick in....and Michael spots Dee Dee, a preop transsexual who is the closest thing to a woman that prison has to offer.  Eventually Michael begins to see Dee Dee as just that, and falls in love.....but love has a price.  Dee Dee's price is the death of Mustafa--he wants Michael to kill him to avenge the death of a friend of Dee Dee's--and Michael sees this as an opportunity to keep he and Dee Dee's love affair a secret from the brothers.  But Dee Dee has his own agenda... <br />Upon his release, Michael is finally able to be with women for the first time.  But he finds himself continuing to desire men, and is in a constant state of denial.  The double life that he then begins to lead has tragic results for Michael and his loved ones. <br /> <br />I've read the other reviews, and I agree that the editing, if done at all, was certainly substandard.  If this were a work of fiction, I might take issue with even more of the novel.  However, the fact that this is based on a true story, done by a brother who clearly has something to say, is compelling.  It gives readers a no-holds-barred look into the prison system, and what goes on within.  The novel takes you into the mind of a young man who is clearly struggling with his sexual identity...and the results of his unwillingness to face reality.  The sex scenes within the book between the men is real, and raw...I saw a couple of kid reviews for this book and wondered where their parents are, as clearly this novel is rated R.  3 stars only for the editing issues...but the story itself is at least a 4.  With a better publishing house, I see this as an author with quality novels in his future. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2005-01-14

Main character Nina is focused on her lifelong goal of becoming a news anchorwoman; until she meets aspiring NBA star Maurice, and becomes embroiled in an unhealthy and destructive relationship.  Nina is so encompassed with catering to his every whim, that she neglects both her job and her family.   When Maurice unceremoniously dumps her, Nina finds herself being drawn into the irresistibly nurturing web that is Leo, aka LJ Love, an aspiring rapper who has secretly loved Nina for years.  Meanwhile, Nina is observing what appears to be an unhealthy dynamic between her parents; that of slave and master, with her mother being the epitome of subservient.  When Nina's mother becomes ill, she eventually pleads with Nina to find a love that is truly deserving of her.  But can Nina break the cycle?  Or will she sacrifice all that she has become with Leo when Maurice comes calling? <br /> <br />This novel is a must-read for any young woman, no matter her ethnicity, who is coming into her own.  Author TJ Butler provides insight into the need to pursue healthy relationships in all aspects of our lives.  Fours stars only because I simply wasn't ready for the book to end; I felt the need to know more about what became of Nina and brother Brice's relationship with their father, and even more about Nina and the delicious Leo.  Perhaps the author will grace us with a sequel.....?? <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2004-11-16

The fun begins when Baltimore-bred Alexandra \\"Barney\\" Barnaby receives an upsetting phone call from her Miami-based brother Bill--a call which ends very abruptly with a woman screaming in the background.  A concerned Barney drops every thing to rescue her wayward brother--yet again.  Upon her arrival in Miami, Barney not only discovers that her brother appears to have vanished without a trace, but apparently she isn't the only one looking for him.  Hot on her heels is one dangerously handsome, famous NASCAR driver Sam Hooker;  apparently brother Bill has \\"borrowed\\" his boat.  Bill's apartment is searched repeatedly, and a couple of shady characters appear to also be in hot pursuit.  It doesn't take long for Barney to join forces with Hooker--and the fact that he's a cutie doesn't hurt.  Soon the duo discover that a young Cuban girl (Maria)is also missing, appears to be with Bill, and that both sunken treasure and the Cuban government may be involved.  This fast-moving tale takes the reader from South Beach to the Florida Keys, in addition to outlying islands in Cuban waters.  The laughs are many when longlost gay friend Judey helps out (accompanied by his spice cookie loving dog Brian), and Cuban-born Maria's friends Rosa and Felicia (both fearless and good with guns).  With this colorful cast of characters, the bad guys don't stand a chance. <br /> <br />While not quite a \\"Plum\\" novel, with some additional practice I think that Barney's on her way.  Let's hope this is the start of another fun Evanovich series. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2004-11-15

Kate White's debut novel introduces amateur sleuth Bailey Weggins (what a name!); she is newly divorced, and dating, albeit somewhat reluctantly.  Bailey writes for a Gloss, a sexy fashion magazine run by good friend Cat Jones.  Cat lives the dream life of a high-powered Manhattan magazine exec, married to a dreamboat...until her nanny is murdered.  The intended victim appears to be Cat herself, however, and Cat calls friend Bailey to have her do a little investigation herself outside of what the police are doing...she wants to make sure that gorgeous-and-now-dead nanny Heidi wasn't involved in anything that could prove embarrassing to her or the magazine.  But Bailey may be in over her head...as it seems as though the murderer is now stalking Bailey herself. <br /> <br />A serviceable mystery, it's certainly an enjoyable read.  Readers may find themselves becoming annoyed with \\"heroine\\" Bailey and her lapses in common sense ( who walks around Bucks county in the dead of night when they know they are being stalked?) with regard to both her own safety and her love life (i.e., the elusive commitmentphobic K.C.)...but a fun read it is, although I felt it lacked a certain spark.  There was not enough insight into the behind-the-scenes activities of a fashion magazine; it is certainly not deserving of a Sex In The City comparison (as indicated in one review).  But if you'd like a fun, uncomplicated mystery with a Manhattan backdrop, this may be what you're looking for. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2004-11-06

I was drawn immediately into the wonderful and tragic life of Henry and Claire.  Claire has known Henry virtually all of her life--decades before he eventually becomes her husband, thanks to his uncontrollable ability to \\"time travel.\\"  Genetic anomaly that he is, Henry is afforded glimpses into the future that Claire longs to share...in addition to constant revisits to his past.  Henry meets Claire naked in the meadow at her home when she is a very young girl.  He explains his presence as simply as he can (\\"I'm a time traveler\\"), and Claire is accepting as only the young can be.  Years later, in Henry's present, they meet and marry, an inevitability that Claire has simply waited for (as it's been told to her when she was very young by Henry-of-the-future).  Though interesting and somewhat exciting, Henry's travels are dangerous in that he has no control over when and where he goes (who wants to arrive naked in Chicago in the dead of winter?).  The only constant in Henry's life is his love for Claire and her love for him...it is his tenuous connection to his present, no matter where his strange genetics take him.<br /><br />This is a story of life, and love and waiting....and the role of time in all of our lives.  It is a true page turner and a gift to readers anywhere, at anytime.<br /><br />DYB	2004-10-30

After seeing these books virtually everywhere--and their bestseller status--I decided to see what all of the hoopla was about.  I borrowed this book from a friend (it came highly recommended by several people) and attempted to read it.  Note attempted.  I can see where some would find the \\"idyllic\\" little town of Mitford appealing--I guess.  I found it unbelievably Stepfordish.  The cast of characters--especially Father Tim--are just BORING.  I was warned about the apparent lack of plot and action--neither are necessary for me to enjoy a book.  But this was just ridiculous.  The dialogue--who talks like that?  I feel a smidge of guilt for writing this review when I did not complete the book (this is a first), but I just can't do it.  I cannot get through this book, and where I once felt like I cannot leave a book unfinished, this book will remain thus.  Life is simply too short.  On to enjoyable reads. <br /> <br />I'm sure that there must be something I'm missing...?  One can only hope. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2004-10-23

I really took a liking to the graphics on the cover of this hardback novel, and that's what initially drew me in.  What kept me interested was the storyline itself; I found it to be the tale of a woman on the cusp of thirty, who is just beginning to come into her own.  Casey Beck has a film degree and has \\"settled\\" for teaching at a local New York college, not knowing what else to do.  She's \\"in love\\" with John Paul, her boyfriend of 5 years....but the return of his ex-girlfriend, Mali, has sent her entire life into something of a tailspin.  What follows are confrontations (as all travel in the same circle of friends) and what I considered to be avoidable drama.  Although I liked the author's reading style, I found this novel to be riveting...in much the same way one cannot avoid viewing a train wreck.  I found NONE of the characters at all likeable--not sure if that's a reflection of the storyline itself or a lack of character development on the part of the author.  The behavior of all of the friends involved--Mali, Polo, Peter, you name it--I found to be unbelievable and borderline ridiculous. <br />Three stars mainly because I'm having difficulty separating my dislike for the characters from my enjoyment of the book itself.  I would recommend this tale as an enjoyable, light, read. <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2004-10-11

Having never known his father, he tries to be the best parent that he can be to his young son Khalil.  But the lure of the streets, his other parent, is tough to ignore...can he do the right thing and be the role model to his son that he needs to be?  In a nearby Philadelphia suburb (but worlds away from his son's North Philadelphia neighborhood socioeconomically,) Calvin Sharpe has just announced to his wife of 30 years that he is leaving her.  The thrill is gone, and his white mistress is waiting in the wings.  Calvin dropped out of his son's life years ago because of Jermaine's difficult mother, and hasn't missed a beat.  But you know what they say about a woman scorned; and Robin, Calvin's wife, refuses to be deserted.  She's going to tell, and tell it all.....for she knows all about young Jermaine that her husband abandoned.  Soon the whole family knows of Jermaine's existence, and they can't wait to meet him.  Meanwhile, Calvin's idyllic life seems to be collapsing like a house of cards....but is it too late for him to make things right with his oldest son? <br /> <br />A quick read, this was a positive, uplifting book about the power of the Black man...when he allows himself to be empowered.  I enjoyed this novel so much, I will be actively looking for additional work from Mr. Hunter..... <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2004-10-10

But then a storm blows in, by the name of Sugar Lacey, and sets up house at #10 Grove Street.  Everyone is curious; who is she?  Where is she from?  What is she doing here?  Frustration and the lack of answers to these questions drives the good-hearted Pearl Taylor to Sugar's front door.  But the door swings open, and Pearl finds herself confronting the tragedy that visited her family some 15 years ago.  It was back then that her beloved daughter Jude was violently murdered, as a young girl.  Pearl is shocked to find that the stranger from out of town looks so much like her lost daughter..and a friendship is born.  Pearl's friends are shocked--how could a good Christian woman be around someone like that?  Pearl tries to ignore the pleas of her friends--and the sounds of all of the men coming and going from Sugar's at all hours of the night--and befriends her anyway.  But there is so much that Sugar hasn't shared--what about her family?  How did she become what she is?  As the story progresses, more tragedy unfolds and Pearl feels as though she must again live through the most horrific time in her life... <br /> <br />Ms. Mcfadden is one of the most gifted writers that I have ever had he pleasure of reading.

And if you are one of the few remaining people on earth who did NOT hear that ridiculously raw Whitney Houston interview, all is not lost---Wendy has included it here also. <br /> <br />Looking forward to the next book, Wendy (will there be one?)...; but PLEASE reserve some of your future juicy gossip just for the book.

Certainly not an adjective that you'll find in Webster's, but one that I think most adequately describes this book. I found this to be a wonderfully engaging tale about Randall Hollis and the women who inhabit his world....    Meet Medora.  A gifted and talented artist, Medora is beautiful to boot.  She's also known Randall Hollis practically all of her life.  She's been comfortable with their relationship for years..noncommittal, completely uncomplicated, with an ease in interaction that only comes with knowing someone for many years.  But she's reached a point in her life where what he is giving her is just not enough.  She's decided to put Randall out of her life, but it looks as though that decision did not come soon enough......    And then there's Ana.  Many years older than Randall, she is flattered by his attentions.  He has made her feel beautiful and desirable, something that she hasn't felt in a long time.  She even forgives him his earlier deceptions, and their relationship strengthens and deepens.  Randall thinks that he may have truly found love, and Ana believes that he may be her second chance.  And then their world blows up when more deceptions are discovered, with the bomb being ignited by one.....    Taylor Benedict.  Many years younger than Randall, she has been having a physical relationship with him for months.  Young, immature, and completely self-centered, she is the quintessential B.A.P.  But why is it that Randall is only available on Thursdays?  And what does she really want from him anyway...and he from her?    This a tightly woven tale in which the author brings all of the characters together very nicely.  The relationship drama is really only secondary to the author's message through her story of how our relationships with our parents can impact our life choices, and forever determine the direction in which we choose to travel.

Junior Cain shocks readers with his heinous actions at the beginning of the tale...and continues to do so throughout.  Seemingly a true sociopath, nothing unnerves Mr. Cain more than his early encounter with one plain, unpretentious police detective...and his magic quarter tricks.  Unless it is the predicted encounter with a man call Bartholomew...... <br /> <br />Far from Cain, a young prodigy is born in the midst of tragedy...to a very special family.  At a very young age he loses his eyesight...but this does not deter him in the least.  He continues to thrive, and though fully aware of how incredibly intellectually advanced he is, his loved ones do not yet fully understand the breadth of his special gifts..... <br /> <br />And in the city of San Francisco there was born yet another special little girl under horribly tragic circumstances.  Hated at first by the very one who will grow to adore her, Angel is loved by all who know her.  But none have any idea how special she is.....or how and what her gifts will mean to many others. <br /> <br />Koontz does a fabulous job of weaving an intricate tale and bringing all of these key characters together...forming an intriguing novel.

She awakens days later, on a cold slab in the mortician's office, in a horrible pink suit...to say nothing of the Payless shoes.

Her bloodsucking peers look for her to rescue them from the tyrannical rule of Nostro, a longtoothed control freak who is at war with the deliciously gorgeous Sinclair...who is also prophesied to rule as king with the Manolo-clad Betsy.  But can Betsy rise to the occasion?  How can a woman whose biggest concern is not being seen in last season's Prada slides overthrow a dictator?  And how in the world can she EVER manage to resist the irresistible Sinclair, when she hasn't been laid in a year?  And who cares about vamp politics anyway?

Three in all, sister Dana is the youngest and the only girl; as the middle child, Sparks tells of his many insecurities growing up--with Dana being \\"special\\" as the only girl (they had exactly the same birthday but only Dana would get parties) and Micah being the bigger and better older brother--better at everything--it is amazing that the author was able to stay positive and maintain the extreme love for his siblings as he so clearly does.  Adulthood, while not spent in the same poverty as his childhood seems beset with tragedy; sudden deaths, terminal illnesses and the like.  Through it all, the author of course survives and one can only marvel at his strenth and courage. <br /> <br />While not the usual fictional story of love that he is known for, this memoir seems to me to be one long autobiographical love story...the love of the author for his parents, his siblings, his wife and his family.

In this tale, the heroine is sent on a goodwill mission to Guatemala, to aid in the recovery and identification of the remains of the victims of a massacre that took place many years ago.  Amidst the drama at Chupen Ya, Tempe also becomes involved in the disappearances of several young girls that appear to be linked....is a serial killer on the loose?   <br /> <br />While identifying the innocent victims of Chupen Ya, the search for the present day killer brings Tempe in close contact with the handsome Galiano, the local detective who is determined to bring both past and present day killers to justice. <br /> <br />Though the story was certainly engaging and enlightening, I did at times find the dialogue somewhat difficult to follow (who's speaking now??).....and most readers will long for more interaction with the obviously handsome Galiano; or even Ryan, the returning Quebec-based detective with whom Tempe already has a history.  The ending was a treat, leaving readers looking for the next novel in the series to find out with whom Ms. Brennan may be finding romance this time around..... <br /> <br />This one is a difficult one to put down. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />DYB	2004-07-26

Meeting in college, these three friends form a lifelong bond than can only be broken by one thing. <br />  <br /> Carmen is somewhat of an outcast in college. With no parents and a homelife that is downright scary, Carmen exists on loans, jobs, and no sleep to make ends meet. When she arrives &quot;home&quot; one day and finds her brother gone and a notice of eviction at the apartment, she realizes her brother has been stealing her money. Carmen packs everything she owns--which isn't much--and vacates the only home she has ever known, finding herself with nowhere to go. <br />  <br /> Jewell is a former childstar who has always had everything--or so everyone thinks. What she truly wants is to finally make her own decisions about her life and her career..and to be treated like a normal person. But despite everything, there is a hole in her life and her heart that she must come to terms with before her life can ever be complete. But she goes to college and meets....... <br />  <br /> Regina, who is momentarily wowed by former child star Jewell, but realizes immediately that she wants only to be treated like everyone else. Concerned more with her social life than her grades, Regina has always felt like the black sheep of her family..a family whom to her seems disgustingly normal and boring. The two form a friendship, and soon decide to move off of the college campus into their own apartment. <br />  <br /> In a chance meeting in the library elevator, the three come together. The elevator is momentarily stuck, allowing for more conversation than usual...and soon a friendship between the girls is born. It doesn't take Jewell and Regina long to discover that their friend Carmen is homeless...and they immediately invite her to join them in their new digs, apartment 5D. And the bonding begins..... <br />  <br /> Through all of lifes ups and downs,these women are there for each other--marriage, births, drug abuse, life-threatening illness and life discoveries--until a tragedy occurs of monumental proportions, and the realization hits that they may not always be able to be together. <br />  <br /> Ms. DeBerry and Ms. Grant have put together a wonderfully written tear-jerker of a story of the love between friends...this is a tale that will make you long for the closeness that you once had with a special girlfriend, and remind us all not to take anything for granted. <br />  <br />  <br /> DYB	2004-07-22

Mimi is part of a singing trio who are determined to make it big...with the help of their questionably well-connected manager Kenny.  When an audition is arranged with Lamont Jackson, the head of Triple Large Entertainment, the girls think that their dreams have finally come true.  But according to the big boss the only one of the three that shows any promise is Mimi...and after much consideration and a series of events, Mimi drops her friends and signs the contracts to begin her solo career.<br />Dubbed the Princess of the label, Lamont takes her under his wing and begins the task of making her over--vocal coaches, shopping sprees, personal trainers.  And when Mimi and the big man become romantically involved, the gifts never stop coming....<br />Everything however comes to a head when a promising young star from the label, young Billy Da Kid, and disgraced TLE producer Daryl aka Country D have a climactic meeting of disastrous proportions..and Mimi is forced to take a hard look at the turn that her life has taken and a even harder look at her husband-to-be.<br />Clearly written by a true hip-hop insider, Bling offers us peek into the music industry's most popular culture....hip-hop.

How smart of Kennedy to capitalize on two of the hottest things going right now...the popularization of African-American writers and novels (they're just discovering that we do read!!) and hip-hop culture....move over Ms. Collins, this one is every bit as good as one of yours.<br />DYB	2004-07-11

As a child, her best friend and soulmate Hope was viciously murdered--and the culprit was never found.  Now, as a young woman, Tory returns to Progress, South Carolina, the town where she grew up, to confront her own personal demons.  However, there are a couple of physical ones that Tory must also contend with; her own abusive father, who seems intent on continuing that legacy, and Hope's murderer--who is still out there.  Or are they one and the same?  Equally disturbing to Tory are the feelings that she is discovering that she has for Hope's surviving brother Kincade...has she found love at last?  Can it survive all of the violence and evil to come?<br />Nora Roberts has put together the best of every genre in this wonderful tale.  She has certainly found another fan in me.<br />DYB	2004-07-08

Evanovich and her sterotypical portrayal of African-Americans is troublesome at best.  The only Black person who is a mainstay in her novels is Lula--who is of course a former &quot;ho&quot;--and now of course the gang in Ten who is out to get Stephanie.  They are, of course, black, and involved in drugs and murder and the like.  Ho Hum.  Ms. Evanovich, you are doing a serious disservice to your African-American fans (of which I am one) by constantly portraying them in a negative manner.

Not exactly what I'm used to from a Grisham novel, but a decent story nonetheless.  Tale is set in Clanton, Mississippi, where a young man with his rich aunt as a benefactor is able to purchase the town's only newspaper, the Times.  Circulation is decent at best, until a spectactular murder occurs with a member of the town's most notorious crime family (the Padgitts) as the prime suspect.  In a world where justice is for sale and judges are for hire, a jury of 12 of the suspect's peers find him guilty of rape and murder, and sentence him to life--which by Mississippi standards is never any longer than 10 years.<br />Over the course of the incarceration, Willie Traynor, main character and owner of the times, manages to create a very successful newspaper while writing at times various human interest stories.  One story in particular is about one of Clanton's &quot;colored&quot; families; Callie and Esau Ruffin, who reared 8 children, 7 of whom went on despite all of the prejudice to get their doctorate degrees.  During the process of writing the story Willie develops a bond with Callie....who also just happens to be one of the twelve jurors who convicted Danny Padgitt of murder.  Willie is also busy keeping tabs on Danny, and his parole bids....especially since Danny threatened the lives of the jurors if they ever found him guilty.....<br />Again, a little slow at first.  I think Grisham would have been better served to concentrate more on Padgitt, his incarceration, and the like rather than the friendship/small town happenings aspect of the story.  Is Grisham getting soft in his old age??  <br />Not bad, but if you want fast, this is not the one to read.<br />DYB	2004-06-23

Newly married, Curtis vows to do it better the second time around.  With new wife Mariah, a new church and a handsome six-figure salary, it does appear as though the reverend has made a comeback.

He once again promises to leave his current wife to marry Adrienne, and together they vow to begin divorce proceedings against their respective spouses within six months.  Then Adrienne becomes too demanding, and Curtis takes a chance on contacting Charlotte--the underage teenager from his old church with whom he had not only an affair but an illegitimate child--and promises her also that he will leave his wife and marry her.  But the world once again begins to cave in when Adrienne becomes suspicious, tragedy strikes his daughter Alicia, and wife Mariah becomes aware of his illicit activities.<br />It's not long before history seems to repeat itself--there's a letter to the deacons, a videotape, and an ending that the reader won't even begin to guess is coming.........<br />Enjoyable to the very last page, Curtis Black remains the unbelievable reverend that we'll all need to pray for!

The cover of this novel was a complete turn-off to me, but I got past that and read the book anyway.  Disappointing.  Character development was poor, storyline was sterotypical and unrealistic.  Clearly the author neither lived a lifestyle as indicated in his book, nor did his research well.  This was a storyline reminiscent of Superfly or Shaft--although not as well done.  I think that Black writers need to raise the bar--and we as Black readers need to raise our level of expectation regarding a good read.<br />DYB	2004-02-19

In this wonderful piece of work, Ms. Rhodes takes a look at a less familiar aspect of Frederick Douglass's life...that of the personal.  Based on historical fact, Ms. Rhodes weaves the tale of Anna Murray--a free woman of color who meets the strapping young slave in Baltimore, and funds his escape to freedom in the North.  As promised, he sends for her; they marry and she is soon pregnant with the first of their many children.  Upon arrival in the town of New Bedford, Douglass aligns himself with White abolitionists and soon becomes known for being a great writer and orator.  It is during these activities that he meets the German Ottilie Assing.  Educated, well-bred, and Jewish, the blonde-haired Ms. Assing is fascinated by Frederick Douglass; she soon finds herself falling in love and beginning a decades long affair with the famous abolitionist.<br />Steeped in historical fact, this novel takes an in-depth look at Frederick Douglass the man--and his relationships with the two main women in his life; his wife and his mistress.  Undoubtedly invaluable to the cause of abolition, the story drives home that beneath it all Frederick Douglass remains simply a man--with all of the frailties and imperfections that make him thus.<br />DYB	2004-02-09

Although Tower is free physically, he is having a difficult time mentally adjusting to life on the outside in his hometown of Fort Worth, Texas.  Complicating matters are the three women in his life; Mary, the parole officer who has manipulated Tower into a physical relationship in an attempt to control him; Gayle, the woman who has a passion for writing and a love for Tower, and is putting his entire life story on paper; and Tonya, the very overweight and deeply religious woman who denotes herself Tower's \\"spiritual advisor\\" while also becoming physically and emotionally involved with him.<br />Throughout, Tower struggles with the \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" aspects of his psyche.  He is emotionally unavailable, and admits to himself that if he could involve himself in a real relationship, Gayle would be the woman with whom he would do so.  His main goal is to find Lisa, his girlfriend of 10 years ago who was pregnant with his child when he went to jail.<br />Ms. Robinson weaves a haunting, realistic tale that is the reality of far too many of our black men.

Having been a Dean Koontz fan in the past, I've not read a book of his in years as they seemed to be moving into the realm of scifi, of which I am not a fan.  This novel, however, is the Dean Koontz that I've loved from years past.<br />Meet Odd Thomas.  He is a likable young man, in his early twenties, who is considered somewhat an anomaly amongst the townfolk of Pico Mundo.  Odd can see and communicate with the dead.  Not everyone knows of his powers, though everyone sees him as being &quot;different.&quot;  The only folks privy to this information are those closest to Odd; one being Stormy Llewellyn, the love of his life, and another being the Chief of police of the small town, who is somewhat of a surrogate father to Odd.  This special relationship forged between the Chief and Odd was born out of Odd's desire to use his powers for good; he is often able to stop acts of violence before they occur.  Sometimes the deceased lead Odd to the offender, so that they may move on to the Other Side.  Until now, Odd has been comfortable with his powers, and how he uses them; and then the stranger arrives.<br />He blends into the crowds easily and nothing about him is remarkable in the physical sense--save for the large number of bodachs that seem to follow him everywhere in Pico Mundo.  Of course, only Odd can see the bodachs--and he knows that they only appear when violence and death are imminent, and typically frolic around the perpetrator prior to the act.  Odd has never seen so many bodachs around one person.  Concerned, he contacts the Chief and tell him what he knows, and what he fears may come to pass.  What follows are a series of events that will keep any reader on the edge of their seat....all the way to the shocking conclusion.<br />This novel to me demonstrates a return of Koontz to his horror genre roots...showing all that he is still a master of the occult.<br />DYB	2004-01-20

Only my commitment to finishing a book when I start it enabled me to complete this fantasy novel passing itself off as suspense.  Despite the 300+ page length, I never felt as though I &quot;knew&quot; the characters in the story.  And although I find paranormal psychology and the like fascinating, the book was just ridiculous.  It was so overwhelmed with this type of detail that the story seemed lost somewhere in the midst of it all.  Certainly, the killer was a surprise, but with better character development a reader could better appreciate the shock.<br />Will I read another Kay Hooper novel?  Possibly, since I am a fan of the genre.  But I won't be reading one anytime soon.<br />DYB	2004-01-12

This novel is a sequel to &quot;When The Wind Blows,&quot; a Patterson work that I enjoyed. This, however, was a very poor follow-up to that wonderful novel.<br />It opens in front of a courthouse in Colorado--where a custody hearing is soon to be taking place.  At odds are the biological parents of the &quot;flying kids&quot; and Frannie, that very likeable veterinarian and Kit, her FBI lover.  Although one cannot help but sympathize with the childrens' natural parents, it is clear that they have &quot;imprinted&quot; (as birds do,) upon Frannie and Kit, and regard them as their &quot;real&quot; mother and father.  The judge, however, sees differently and rules to return the kids to their natural parents.  Everything goes relatively smoothly, until masked men arrive at the home of Max and Matthew in an attempt to spirit them away.  Both escape, and run of course to Frannie, who in turn calls estranged lover Kit.<br />It soon becomes clear that Max, the &quot;matriarch&quot; of the flock is in possession of information that puts all of the kids in danger, and it is necessary to get to the others before they are also visited by evil men with equally bad intentions.<br />The story moves slowly, with flights at night, multiple escapes from marauding strangers, and way too much avian insight to be believable.  When Max finally shares the dangerous information that she knows with Kit, Frannie, and the others, the storyline becomes suspiciously reminiscent of its predecessor--but decidedly more slow.  <br />It is clear from the ending that Mr. Patterson intends to have us visit the bird children at least once more; let's hope that his third attempt is more laudible.<br />DYB	2003-12-08

Scarpetta takes a backseat to some of the other usual characters--Lucy, Marino, etc.<br />Much slower than previous Scarpetta novels, this tale takes the reader on a connect-the-dots journey leading from the last Scarpetta book to the present, attempting to rekindle the reader's memory of past happenings.   Scarpetta has fallen from grace, and is no longer esconced in her custom built Richmond VA mansion.  No longer politically connected, she has been fired from her job as Chief ME and has relocated to Florida, working as a consultant.  Still considered tops in her field, her assistance is requested from a Louisiana coroner--to investigate a &quot;cold case&quot; that had previously been closed.  It soon becomes clear that this case is related to the current serial killings/abductions taking place in the same area.<br />Beyond being pleasantly shocked in the beginning of this novel, Scarpetta fans will be disappointed in the what has always been the main character's lack of presence.  Personally, I was also disappointed with the ending of this book.  Did the timer go off, Ms. Cornwell?<br />I'm hoping that PC will redeem herself in the next Scarpetta tale.  It would help if they came in a more timely fashion--less effort would then have to be spent refreshing the reader's memory.	2003-10-27

I'm a fan of RM Johnson, but when I started this novel and was introduced to two of the main characters--Hennessey and Alize--I was skeptical.  But this book captured my attention and interest immediately.<br />Alize and Hennessey are identical twins--physically.  However, in terms of behavior and personality you could not meet two more different people.  Hennessey is the bookworm; quiet, smart, with real goals in life.  Alize is all about Alize; lives life fast, and has no use for people beyond what they can do for her.  <br />The turning point is when they cross paths with Rafe, a young ex-con who despite his thug-like exterior has turned his life around and has a desire to do better. He and Hennessey begin a romance...but Rafe has difficulty extricating himself from his former lifestyle, and a friend who has not left the business.  The result is a series of climactic events sure to keep fans of RM Johnson riveted, and yearning for more!	2003-09-03

She pulls you into the lives of the three main characters...and makes you sympathize with all three.  Even when the adultery takes place--it's difficult to find a villain in this tale.  What you are faced with are just three ordinary people--with very human-like flaws.<br />This is a powerfully written tale--of love, friendship, betrayal, and love lost.

I am a fan of EJD, have read all of his work, and I think that this is quite possibly the best book that he has ever written.<br />I knew that the book focused on infidelity; obvious from the title. But I was completely unprepared for how events unfolded.<BR>I was expecting fights, unhappiness, SOME level of drama prior to the infidelity; but there was none. What I was faced with was a seemingly happily married couple who seemed to be totally in sync--sexually, spiritually, financially. Until our narrator--who remains unnamed throughout--is contacted by the husband of the Other Woman. His name is David Lawrence--and he informs our narrator that her husband is sleeping with his wife.<br />What follows is a tale of revenge, betrayal and tragedy that the reader probably doesn't expect. What makes this tale so unique is that since the reader is seeing everything through the eyes of our narrator, all we see is a great relationship--until the Phone Call. And then we see a relationship unravel; and we find ourselves also the unwitting partner in a marriage who sees everything as being wonderful when it most certainly is not. We are truly the partner who \\"thought everything was fine,\\" while the miserable other half seeks solace in another.<br />This book actually made me cry, and took me completely by surprise. It is quite possibly Mr. Dickey at the top of his game.	2003-05-21

I believe that the mark of a truly great storyteller is one who can captivate and enthrall outside of his \\"genre;\\" and James Patterson has done that and more in The Jester.<br />Set in medieval times during the Crusades, this is the story of a poor innkeeper named Hugh De Luc--whose life consists of simple pleasures...his village, his friends, his inn, and the great love that he has for his wife Sophie.  All is well until Hugh decides to join the fight for Christianity and freedom--and finds only death, carnage and evil.  He returns to his village several years later to discover that everything that he held dear had been stripped away from him; his inn burned to the ground, and his beloved Sophie abducted by the evil knights of his liege.<br />This is truly an epic love story--of love lost, found, and lost again; only to be rediscovered in another.

There was really never a dull moment in this book.  Austin, the oldest brother who I really disliked in \\"The Harris Men,\\" even redeemed himself in this book.  In the first book, he comes across as selfish, pompous and self-centered.  This novel humanizes him to a degree where the reader can, if not forgive, then at least understand his transgressions.<br />Caleb really develops in this novel also.  He becomes more than the younger brother who constantly makes bad decisions and stays in trouble.  He becomes more human also, as he sees himself in another troubled youngster whom he befriends; and he has discovered that there is more to fatherhood than putting food on the table.<br />Marcus, who was the one likeable character in the earlier novel, develops some qualities that are less than redeeming.  He has chosen to disown his family--estranged father Julius for abandoning them in the first place; Austin, who in Marcus's eyes is the mirror image of their father; and Caleb, who despite all of Marcus's best efforts, managed to get himself jailed for 5 years anyway.  It is up to Reecie, now Marcus's new wife who is pregnant with their first child, to restore Marcus to the caring and family-oriented man that he once was.<br />Julius is still the father who wants nothing more than forgiveness from his sons...so that he may die knowing that they love and forgive him.  <br />Ultimately, this novel is about love, family, and forgiveness....all wrapped up in a package filled with drama that will keep you turning until the very last page.

I so loved the story behind the relationship between Zoe and Jason; the fact that they were childhood sweethearts, and that we grew up with them in the book. I was completely shocked at her affairs and the fact that there were several..but I so loved all of the drama that inevitably accompanied them!  Let's all applaud Zane for not being afraid to show the world, especially the African-American world that:<br />1).  Often times it is women who are involved in the adulterous <BR>     behavior<br />2).  All of us could perhaps stand a little mental health  <BR>     intervention every now and again.<br />Hats off to you Zane, for going where no one has gone before...at least not to the extent that you did!	2001-10-05

Welcome to the world of Lisa Scottoline, where the lawyers are anything but typical and little old men fancy themselves as enforcers of family honor....who couldn't love the Tonys, in all of their Italian South Philly glory?  Lisa has found just the write blend of suspensful and comedic writing in this tale.  Most endearing to me is Judy, that trailblazer of a lawyer who refuses to conform to the rules of socially acceptable \\"lawyer behavior\\" and dress.  <br />The familiar setting that the story takes place in--Philadelphia and its surrounding Western suburbs--is also something that I found extremely enjoyable, being a local reader.<br />Thanks for the gift Lisa....I'm a new recruit and will now be going back to inhale all of your books!!	2001-10-02

You have to give props to the gentleman who continues to love and support the woman who left him to follow a love of her own---one who happens to be another woman.<BR>Most women who are in search of a &quot;good man&quot;, however, will eventually find his persistence hard to swallow (find a woman who is more deserving!); that is certainly how I felt. Nicole, the love of this man's life, I disliked as a character. I found her to be selfish, and self-centered, and certainly undeserving of the love that is showered upon her by both her past boyfriend and current lover.<BR>Ayanna, Nicole's new love, was difficult to like as a character also; I found her to be both angry and spiteful. Overall, I could not fathom why the two of them continued to pursue Nicole as they did...<BR>The storyline was original and extremely interesting. And the way this man writes and describes the lovemaking between all involved is pure poetry.....well done, EJ.	2001-09-18
US	51152855	R2ZT0ALOR4R2CM	0525944834	75400210	Liar's Game	Books	5	1	2	N	N	SNOWBALL EFFECT	After taking an Eric Jerome Dickey hiatus, I don't think that I could have found a better novel to usher me back into the fold.  I have to say that The Liar's Game was a &quot;snowball&quot; of a book in the sense that it began relatively slow, but increased in size and momentum to the point that I was so riveted, I found it impossible to put down.  And what interesting characters!<br />VINCE:  Most of us know a Vince; a seemingly great guy, with &quot;luggage&quot; from past relationships, of both the physical and mental kind.  We all have to sympathize with him and the difficulties that his ex-wife if presenting where their child is concerned.  Although he loves Dana, the ghost of his love for Malaika is haunting their relationship.<br />DANA:  She's all of us, most of us.  She is fresh from a disappointing relationship with a guy she truly loved; he is her spectre.  Her insecurites with respect to her relationship with Vince are a direct result of that past damaging love interest.<br />CLAUDIO:  Every woman has had her Claudio.  The suave, cool bad boy that we all adore who can only promise to disappoint us in the end.<br />The finale in the novel is a burst of fireworks, and will leave you with your mouth open!  Congratulations to Mr. Dickey on a fabulous read...I've already ordered the new novel.	2001-06-27

Trisha Thomas captured in her novel characters that we certainly all know.<br />I think that most African-American women are a Venus, have been a Venus, or will one day confront the Venus-like way of thinking that we all fall victim to when we subscribe to a standard of beauty set by others who are unlike ourselves.  By cutting her hair, Venus acknowledged a desire to know more than her physical self; she confronted and embraced the woman that she knew that she could be, inside.  Who would not applaud her for that?<br />As for Kandi...most of us will never feel the need to look that deeply within ourselves, nor have the strength to just let go.  Kandi is a woman that we all know, and perhaps the woman that most of us actually are.  Although I was hoping for the reuniting of Clint and Venus, a higher deity steered both towards what they needed and knew.<br />Great job, Trisha...looking forward to that next novel.	2001-06-04

Hats off to Michael, who was truly at his best while penning The Maintenance Man!  It was just the book that I needed...a quick, fast, fun read that just too hard to put down.  While I really can't say that I actually know a real-life gigolo, I think every woman has known a Teddy in her life.  Thanks for a great book, Michael....can't wait until the next one!	2001-05-02

I usually find anything that JG writes to be extremely  entertaining, but I am forced to lump this one in the same category as  &quot;The Chamber,&quot; which I also found to be a difficult read.<br />Maybe  his next concoction will be better....?	2000-03-16

Winter portrays and probably speaks to a lot of our young women; I was unable to put the book down, and I can only hope that it opens the eyes of  some of our young people....it's ain't all about the  &quot;Benjamin's&quot;.  Know what's important and what really matters in  this life; don't emulate Winter and find out the hard way.	1999-11-15
US	51152855	R1USCQGTS4XVD2	0446524204	649812238	Getting to the Good Part	Books	4	0	0	N	N	Book was certainly entertaining.	I thought that the book was entertaining, and I would recommend for those looking for a light, entertaining read; however, I found it completely unrealistic and frankly the character Reesy was somewhat sickening. I don't  know anyone that behaves that way....how about you?  And how is it that  everybody ends up with a man who is rich, handsome, generous and has  absolutely no personal issues (i.e., ex-wife, scandal, etc.)....???<br />All  in all, if you can past ghetto Reesy and the fact that she responds to her  friend Misty as though she were a spurned lover, you'll enjoy the book.  I  did!	1999-06-29

This book was one that I just couldn't put down...and who wanted to?  I'm already on the edge of my seat waiting for the sequel....the ending certainly leaves you with that expectation.   Thanks, E. Lynn for another great book which certainly transcends sexuality  and simply leaves one with a tale of love and friendship.	1999-06-29
