I'm surprised by the negative feedback.  I wonder if these people have ever experienced an affair?  I, unfortunately, had to experience the horror of my husband having an affair.  I can honestly say that I saw myself and my husband in almost ALL of this book... can't say much about the OW since I don't give a darn about her... but if it was so on the mark with my husband and I, it most likely is with her... (I admit I skipped that chapter on HER since I don't care at all about what she was feeling as she seduced a married man. I know it went both ways, but I know she made many many phone calls to him and kept the communication between them wide open to make him feel she was so trustworthy and full of wisdom).<br /><br />I knew the signs and felt them coming.  This book helps one see what kind of relationships could snowball - as it did in our situation.  I felt uncomfortable when they went on a business trip together (which started everything) and felt something wasn't right when he went to lunch with her so often.  That's how it all began!  Then IMing, emails, phone calls, late nights at work, early mornings BEFORE work... the list goes on and on.  Ladies, keep your eyes open all the time.  I thought my husband would be the last person on earth who would cheat on me, but he did.  He talked to her about all our problems and of course, she could relate to it and explain why she divorced... made it seem like the right thing to do since our marriage was &quot;over&quot; anyway.  How she could convince him when he had a brandnew baby (6 wks &amp; 3 yrs) at home and how he could ever think that it is a good time to leave is beyond me.  He said, &quot;It's never the perfect time to leave.&quot; HA  Sounds like something a woman would say if she were trying to convince someone to leave their wife!  He was gone for 8 weeks when he saw just what he was loosing and he came home finally to the relief of everyone.  This book has been a godsend to me during this time.  I can relate to every emotion Shirley Glass describes about the betrayed partner.  I've recommended this book to all my married friends so they can read and know what to watch for (I don't think they think it could happen to them - just like I thought!).  It can happen to anyone and it doesn't start out, like she explains, as two people intending on having an affair, but when the conditions are right, things happen.	2004-11-23

I've tried to sit down and read it to him several times, but it's just too advanced (and long) for him - and I consider him very advanced in the types of books he likes to read, but this one absolutely bores him.  Hopefully someday we'll be able to finish it, because I'd like to know what happens too! (it is a bit long and drawn out with big words and even I get a little tired of all the verbage).	2004-11-23

Glad I didn't just let him calm himself... because we tried but it took way too long for him to wear himself out.  HOWEVER, we don't run to him immediately now - we do let him cry for a little while before coming in and checking on him. (A couple nights ago he got the flu in the middle of the night and had vomit all over his face, so it's important to still check on them and listen for their distinctive cries.)  I do know his sleepy cry and his hungry cry now!  There is definitely a difference once you start really paying attention!!  So, this book was very helpful, even though some medical conditions can be one of the problems.	2004-11-23

I found the information about \\"helpful friends\\" right on the nose.  Friends can inadvertantly lead you to divorce by just agreeing with everything you say.  I think this happened with my husband... he had a woman (affair partner) who sympathized with how he was feeling every step of the way which supported how he was feeling and lead him to think divorce was the best option (even though I constantly offered to go to counseling).  It is a happy ending though - he eventually saw the light after filing for divorce and separating for 8 long weeks.  Still have a lot to work through, but he doesn't realize how this OW's support helped him leave his family.  Men can be so easily manipulated sometimes!  Sorry guys, but you can be putty in a woman's hands - and the funny thing is - my husband swears he made his mind up on his own!  This book explains how people in turmoil would think that their friends are just being good listeners, but it's support from well-meaning friends that can lead you astray.	2004-11-23

I eventually did get confirmation of this.  During this time of suspiscion (sp?), I had been reading books on how to improve my marriage and how I should be treating my husband.  I tried those techniques and he said basically, \\"Too late, anything you do might just backfire.\\"  He moved out then filed for divorce.  Then I heard about this book and thought I might as well give it a try too... after I'd been reading lots about affairs and such.  I followed this book to the letter.  Thank you so much Dr. Dobson.  You helped save my marriage.  My husband said one of the reasons he came back was a letter I sent to him - suggested from this book.  He was gone 8 long weeks before he decided that this divorce wasn't what he really wanted.  I know if it hadn't been for this book, he might've eventually come home (maybe), but I'm not so sure.  Please get this book.  You will not be disappointed.  I told my husband that the day he called me wanting to see me, I'd been praying constantly that he'd come to his senses.  He said he heard it loud and clear.  We are not even religious people, but it worked...!	2004-10-25

I can't explain what great advice Dr.Dobson gives in this book.  Basically tough love for marriages.  My husband left for 8 weeks and finally came back - one of the reasons is because of this book.  You cannot go wrong if you buy this book.  It is a little religious, which I wasn't for or against, but it's practical sound advice.   <br /> <br />Another great book that has somewhat the same principals as \\"Love Must Be Tough\\" is \\"The Divorce Remedy: The Proven 7-Step Program for Saving Your Marriage\\".  This book was great too and had good advice on how to act towards your mate during the turmoil.   <br /> <br />I read many many books during our crisis and these two were the best advice I got.

During our 8 week separation, I thought I would go nuts.  I did NOT want a divorce at all and was trying everything I could to save my marriage.  My husband acted as if he didn't care at all about it - he didn't.  This book helped tremendously.  It's a Tough Love solution basically.  Great practical advice - advice that you wouldn't think about because it goes against how you want to act... beg, plead, etc... for them to come to their senses and not leave their family.  But, it tells you to get a backbone and standup for yourself, be confident and these qualities will draw your mate back.  It worked for me. <br /> <br />The only other book that helped tremendously and I'd recommend over this one (If you can only buy one) is Dr.James Dobson's \\"Love Must Be Tough\\".  Fantastic advice that I believe saved my marriage.  It's a bit religous, but has great advice nonetheless!   <br /> <br />Good Luck!	2004-09-25

It is a little advanced for him right now, but he LOVES the wonderful pictures in it.  They are truly  fantastic!  I point out different things to him and explain what certain things are.      It's really excellent and I know this book will become a Halloween Tradition.  After reading it, you feel you've just read something very special.  You won't be disappointed!

US	52429275	R60JZRMCB6WHU	0809234300	113235689	Baby Signs	Books	5	15	16	N	Y	Great Book!	By \\"great\\" book, I mean the concept and techniques are great!!!  It's very easy to read and not filled with boring mumbo jumbo.  Lots of examples (LOTS!) to read about as well.  This is not a book you need to read cover to cover in order to understand how to do it.  <br />We started teaching him the signs about 8 months old.  Of course he didn't learn them immediately but a couple months later (even though we didn't do them EVERY day) he would start signing to us!  It was incredible!  I think his first sign was Dog.  He'd pant like a dog!  It was so cute!!!  He LOVED showing me dogs after that.  In the grocery store one day we were standing in the front of the store waiting for help and I didn't realize we were next to the dog food bags until our son started doing the dog sign.  I looked around for a dog and sure enough, there on the bag was the dog he was trying to point out to me!  <br />These signs have been THE BEST thing we have taught our son so far!  He's 18 months old and knows a lot of signs, although now he's trying to say everything instead of signing.  But if he didn't know how to sign, his communication would have been so limited!  He still signs a lot, \\"More\\" \\"Sippy\\", \\"More\\" \\"Sippy\\" or \\"Bite Bite\\" (meaning he wants something else to either drink or eat).  So, instead of him crying to communicate what he wants he just signs it!<br />Now he's learning to talk and just yesterday he was trying to say Cat.  It came out \\"Cauk\\".  I didn't understand what he was saying so I tried to think of all the words he knew that sounded like that, so I said Duck? (he says \\"Cack Cack\\" for duck + opens and closes his hand like a ducks mouth).  So, He again said \\"Cauk!\\".  I said, \\"Clock?\\" and he looks around trying to think of how to make me understand then said \\"Maow!\\" (That's his cat sign!)  So then I knew he had seen our cat outside and he wanted me to know!  I was so proud of him!  <br />You will NOT be disappointed if you try the techniques in this book!  I've told SOmany people about it and now my friend's daughter (who just turned 1) said she knows 15 signs already!  It's such a wonderful feeling when your baby can communicate with you!  It makes them so happy.  My mom says that she's never seen a baby cry so little!  He doesn't need to!  He can communicate his needs to us!!	2002-02-26

I was shocked to read some of the poor reviews on this book as it was a Godsend to us!  It has information on ANYTHING you may need to know about your baby.  I bought it for my sister when she had her first baby and it went through her two girls then she gave it back to me when I had my first child.  She still calls me up to ask me to look up information in it for her!  Great development tips and exercises to do with your baby which work great!  I was worried about having our son sleep with us when he was little, but it was the ONLY way we could get any rest.  This book reassured me that it was ok to want the baby to sleep with us.  Now my son is 18 months old and I miss the days of him snuggling in bed with us.  He didn't sleep with us forever and the transition was a piece of cake.  <br />Who wouldn't want to be attached to their baby?!  We get SO many comments now on how happy our son is.  He's not a crier or whiner, he's just happy and we can communicate with each other VERY well, so he doesn't NEED to cry.  We understand each other.  Another book that has helped with this is &quot;Baby Signs&quot;.  If you want your baby to communicate with you as early as 8 months old then THIS IS THE BOOK for you.  <br />Great advice in The Baby Book.  I've got the Mayo book and this one for reference.  I ALWAYS can find the answer in The Baby Book!  ALWAYS.	2002-02-26
