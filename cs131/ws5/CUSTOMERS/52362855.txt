Bill Phillips of \\"Body for Life\\" fame comes up with another winner with \\"Eating for Life: Your Guide to Great Health, Fat Loss and Increased Energy\\".<br /><br />The book is a scrumptious way to eat healthy, lose weight and feel better.  Bill's philosophy is that people should eat 5-6 healthy, size appropriate meals per day to keep blood sugars level and ward off fat. So the book is broken up into categories to eat at each of the meals: breakfast, desserts, lunches, midmeals, dinners and shakes.<br /><br />Each recipe comes with a mouthwatering full color photograph and detailed instructions on how to make it. There is also a handy little picture that shows the actual brandname ingredients used in the recipe. For example Albacore Tuna Casserole shows a large color photograph of the dish and another smaller photo with a picture of the ingredients in it; Bumble Bee tuna, Healthy Request cream of mushroom soup, Lucerne fat free milk, Healthy Harvest pasta and Birds Eye peas...what a neat idea!<br /><br />So far I have made a number of recipes from the book and they have all been delicious. There are a number of recipes such as Egg-Cellent Enchiladas, Golden Protein Pancakes, Cool Ranch Dip, Greek Pinwheels, Frosted Key Lime Pie (shake), Pina Colada (shake), Cilantro Burrito, Cool Taco Salad, Cajun Chicken,  Beef and Barley Soup and many more.<br /><br />The ingredients are easy to find and the recipes easy to prepare. Even if you are not on the Body for Life plan this is a wonderful cookbook to own.<br /><br />There is a major drawback with the book and that is the lack of nutritional information. Yes you can go on the BFL website and get this information, but you shouldn't have too. It should be right in the book. One of the drawbacks with not having this information is portion size. The recipes are designed to be BETWEEN a man and a woman's portion. That means for example that the recipe for Singapore Shrimp as shown and prepared in the book is about 374 calories per portion. BUT a man could eat 468 calories as his daily portion and a woman would have to modify the recipe to 281 almost 100 calories less! But it does not tell you this in the book. I only learned this from gathering the nutrition information on the site where it gives average portions and male portions and female portions.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book I don't care for is the use of foods like butterbuds (why not use a tiny portion of real butter) and fat free cheese and sour cream which I find tasteless. Instead I substitute tiny amounts of the tastier full fat version.<br /><br />I really had to debate on whether to give this book 4 or 5 stars. It is my favorite cookbook now and its helping me eat healthier...but the lack of nutritional information in the book is a major blunder especially when the portion sizes vary so much from male to female. I know Bill might say use your palm or fist, but thats hard to do for certain food products. Thus I have to give it 4 stars.<br /><br />Great recipes, beautiful layout..next time Bill give us the nutritional info. too!

In this book Barbara Ehrenreich poses as an out of work white collar worker. Though I am not in the workforce (stayed home with kids and never went back) the book sent a chill through me.<br /><br />Who knows what will happen in the future with one's job or one's spouses job.<br /><br />Barbara writes beautifully and presents the dilemma of the white collar worker who has been fired, downsized or out of work for another reason. Many have difficulty finding a job that replicates the salary and benefits of their former position.  Some ratchet up credit card debt, end up taking low paying jobs, run out of health insurance etc and never make it back to the level of comfort they had experienced at one time.<br /><br />Though I appreciate Barbara's attention to the plight her choices as she posed as an out of work individual were not the best and likely ones she would not have made if she were actually in the situation. She hires counselors whom she gets bad vibes from at the start, attends seminars which she feels are shaky right off the bat, overpays someone $100 when she knows that is not the agree upon amount etc. Granted someone in a desperate situation may not make the best choices, but with so many alarms ringing as Barbara works with this coach or that counseling service it seems like she was deliberately looking not to succeed in her job search for the purpose of the book.<br /><br />A good read but not as revealing as it could have been.	2005-09-19

I have purchased Amy Knapp's organizer for the past several years and find it an inexpensive tool that helps keep me on track.<br /><br />The spiral bound book starts with the August 2005 and runs through December 2006. Includes a weekly day by day calender and a month at a glance calender. Also includes a handy tear off sheet to list groceries with menus on the opposite site.<br /><br />The back of the book has spaces to list names and addresses, stickers for birthday and other reminders and a place to write information for the babysitter.<br /><br />I use the book to notate my workouts and calories also jot down \\"to do's\\" in the space given (which is next to each week).<br /><br />The one draw back is the lack of date tabs to quickly flip to the month. I picked up a set of tabs at an office supply store and transfer them from one year to the next.<br /><br />Overall great calender. Super for keeping me organized!	2005-09-08

Well into his twilight years he manages to surround himself with beautiful, nubile young women who cater to his every whim.<br /><br />In \\"Hef's Little Black Book\\" little glimpses of Hef's life are shared. We learn that Millie (his first wife) cheated on him, thus opening the door for his dalliances. We discover that the gorgeous Barbie Benton broke up with him when she discovered he was double dipping with another. That movie night is a big time in Hef's life. That black silk pj's make for good outerwear etc.<br /><br />If you are a diehard Hef fan you may enjoy this book. On the other hand if you want to learn more about the playmates with shocking insights into Hef such as the awful reality that he does NOT use protection read Jill Ann Spaulding's book, \\"Upstairs\\".<br /><br />Overall \\"Hef's Little Black Book\\" is indeed all about Hef, and only for those who want nitty gritty details shared by Mr. Hefner about himself.	2005-09-08

When Jennifer Saginor was a small child her father and mother split up. Mom ended up with Jennifer's sister and Jennifer with her dad. Dad, a doctor who is also known as \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" due to his ability to provide the drugs that help others feel no pain, spends a good deal of his time hanging out with Hef and the playmates at the Playboy mansion.<br /><br />Young Jennifer eager to please dad becomes an expert at rating the mostly young, mostly blonde, toned females that decorate Hugh Hefner's estate. She is exposed to naked ladies on the lawn, pornographic materials,drugs and booze and a dad who parties way too hard and thinks nothing of walking around naked or sleeping in bed with her. (Though she does not elaborate too much on her dad's sleeping in the same bed or exposing himself, one wonders if there are some things she is not revealing).<br /><br />As she grows up, she finds that she is popular due to her ability to share the \\"fast life\\" with her friends. She also has an internal loneliness from seeing too much too soon.<br /><br />The book is an interesting read, though shorter than what I would like. Another good look at the Playboy Mansion is Jill Ann Spaulding's Upstairs (where Ms. Spaulding reveals what it really takes to become a playmate - sleeping with Hef included).	2005-08-16

Though she was never that overweight, her obsessions with food were making her life miserable. And she kept her weight down by overexercising, undereating etc.<br /><br />In this book Goodman shares her thoughts on what works for her. She \\"talks\\" to the reader and shares ideas on what to do so the reader can also hopefully conquer their food problems.<br /><br />Goodman's book is an interesting read. Though I feel she still has issues with food and likely always will, it appears that she has won the major battles and can work through her feelings.<br /><br />Some of her ideas are totally different. Don't eat salads as a weight loss food (unless you want one) because they won't fill you up and by the time you add on all the dressing you may as well have eaten a satisfying sandwich. Consider eating calcium chews as a dessert. One or two will give you that chocolate or caramel munch and serve as an end to the meal. Use your calories on things you want. If you really want that hunk o'cake eat that instead of dinner. Think about what you are willing to give up so you can eat other things. (In Nancy's case she doesn't eat olive oil or butter).<br /><br />Nancy is really open in the book with her thoughts and feelings. I did feel sorry for her hubby though whom she blasts throughout the book. Also she has the benefit of having spent a number of years working with a food therapist.<br /><br />Overall, it's an interesting read about one woman's struggle to make peace with food and her approach is different than the typical diet advise.	2005-08-08

I purchased this book years ago, decided it was too much work and got rid of it. Then I started reading other diet books, opted to go on the French diet and even got a job working at an online French diet site! What a great opportunity to help other people and lose weight while enjoying chocolate, cheese and wine. There was just one problem, after working for the site over a year I had gained weight!<br /><br />When my scale settled on a new high number it was depressing and the shapeless clothing selection wasn't exciting either.<br />I knew I needed to get the weight off not just for looks but for health purposes also.<br /><br />I have read and tried numerous diets over the years but to be honest I couldn't stay on them for more than a day. And as sexy as the French diet seemed, I had trouble eating french bread, chocolate and other goodies in moderate portions.<br /><br />Then I read an article in the paper. It said that protein satisfied hunger better than fat or carbohydrates. It said that low carbohydrate diets worked not because of the low carbs but because of the high protein. In tests, participants could not eat as much food, nor did they want as much when they ate a higher protein diet. It was like a light bulb flicked on. I had tried high protein diets in the past and knew that they were not for me, but I also knew protein quelled hunger. I did not want to give up carbohydrates but as I read through the article I realized that maybe if I ate less of them and more protein it might be the key. It might help quell my carbo cravings. But what was the right balance?<br /><br />Then I remembered the IR diet book. I bought it again and put it to work. With the IR diet you can eat WHATEVER you want. BUT you must make sure to balance the carbs with the proteins. For every 15 grams of carbs you must balance with 7 grams protein. And you are limited to so many carbs per meal. Though I thought it would be complicated it was actually very easy.<br /><br />To my shock I found I was in control of my cravings the very first day! My breakfast included a high protein and carb cereal with a lo-carb yogurt topper. From that moment on, I found I got hungry less often and when I did I could control my choices. The other day I wanted potato chips so I had some but made sure I linked them with a protein. Most afternoons I enjoy a vita- muffin (recommened by Dr. Gullo in his \\"The Thin Commandments\\" book, which is also outstanding) thats choc o'bloc with fiber and a glass of milk. Linked balanced and no cravings for more later!<br /><br />And the scale started going down immediately. I also found a great support group at soulcysters. Though I don't have PYCOS, many members of the group follow the diet and have found it to be the only thing that works for them. I also believe this plan will help people with or without insulin resistance.<br /><br />The authors do endorse low fat products. The key here is to pick and choose. For example butter gives you a lot of calories in a small amount, but I would rather eat real butter than tasteless lo-cal fat free margarine. But I will eat a lite mayo over the full fat. Make the choices you enjoy.<br /><br />I still enjoy chocolate, wine and cheese but I make sure they are linked and balanced so I am losing weight and I stay in control!s the very first day!

Jill Ann has written a shocking, behind the scenes expose of what goes on upstairs at Hugh Hefner's \\"Mansion\\". Ms Spaulding had a dream of gracing the pages of Playboy as a playmate. So she did everything she could to prepare herself physically including breast implants, makeup lessons, liposuction etc. But she never made it on the pages because she was unwilling to have a sexual relationship with Hef.<br /><br />She did just about everything else though. She paid for pricey party tickets, sucked up to the staff, begged for access to Hef, jumped in bed with other playmates, got naked and feigned girl girl sex etc.<br /><br />Prior to her visit to the mansion, Spaulding thought that the girls on Hef's arms were for the most part pretty publicity. Once inside she realized that Hef expects sex from everyone of them. And if they want to grace his pages they best to what he says.<br /><br />The perks for the chosen girls who live in the mansion include free plush living quarters, 24 hour dining, a wardrobe allowance, a weekly allowance (yes Hef pays his gals for his pleasures), beauty services, cosmetic surgery etc. In exchange the gals must put up with one anothers cattiness as they jostle for favor with Hef. They must also engage in unprotected sex with Hef. Shocking that the man who is looked at as a forerunner in demonstrating that sexuality is beautiful is dumb enough to demand that no protection is used in his bedroom orgies. And no testing is done.<br /><br />The book is a very interesting read. I always thought if one wanted to be a Playmate they would send in a picture and Hef would select the best using his magnifying glass that he is often shown with. Who knew that bedroom romps figure into the equation also. I thought Hef was a bigger man than that and limited himself to several close girlfriends.<br /><br />Ms. Spaulding appears to be a very intelligent woman but she is not a writer. So though she conveys her thoughts the book can be choppy at times. In addition one does feel like shaking her when she continues to pine over not making it into the pages of the magazine. She even goes out and spends $750 on a diamond encrusted rabbit logo necklace like the official girlfriends wear long after she has been univited to return to any parties because she offered to pay $2,000 for a party invite which she says was for her boyfriends benefit..but we all know she just wants to put her face in front of Hef's again.<br /><br />Comeon Jill Ann, be glad you didn't sell out and have unprotected sex with Hef. Sell the necklace and get over the Playboy dream. You are better off without it.<br /><br />Meantime HEF..wakeup call...Use protection if you want to continue having fun with the Bunnies..though it sounds pretty darn shallow to me.<br /><br />The book also includes a resource section that includes where to send your picture and where to write to Hef, if you still want to be a playmate after reading.addition one does feel like shaking her when she continues to pine over not making it into the pages of the magazine.

Sadly I didn't realize this till I had finished the book. So take a peek at the back if you don't know how to play.<br /><br />Chris, started gambling as a child. As he grows older he works hard to make a few dollars but then will rashly toss $500 or even a thousand into a bet for a sports game.<br /><br />Eventually Chris begins to play the game of poker and enters a $40 Pokerstars internet competition.

You can give the impression of \\"hotness\\" by how you style your hair, do your makeup etc.<br />Conrad walks you through the steps.<br />I have always opted for a classic simple style and I am not about to switch to cleavage baring tops or dragon lady nails....but I have taken a few tips from Conrad to spice up my everyday persona.<br />I will keep the short blond classic bob I have though Conrad states that men love long hair (we all know that) but I did start dancing more for exercise and wearing frosty pink on my nails occasionally. I picked up gel baby oil for a soft body glow, fake individual eyelashes for eye flirt and heck even retired a few pair of grandma panties.<br />My complaint with the book is its too short. I want more and greater details. However, the book is a super starting point to have fun with.<br />Other Conrad tips include how to get that pouty mouth, fake bake a tan, what jewelry to wear and more.<br />A super read for women who want more Pama Glama (Pam Anderson) in their life..I just took a tidbit here and a tidbit there without going over the top and am having fun with it!	2005-06-26

So she, her parents and children followed her husband only to discover that they were not to join him but were sent to a concentration camp.<br /><br />At the camp an unwitting Olga made the mistake of telling the Germans her son was under 12. Though he was large and could pass for over 12, Olga thought he would be treated in a lenient manner due to his age. Little did she know older and young people were almost immediately put to death. If the loss of her parents, her children and not knowing what had happened to her husband were not enough Olga had to endure the mental and physical trials of the camp.<br /><br />Those who were not put to death were put to work in the most menial tasks under the most horrible conditions.<br /><br />Olga leaves nothing to the imagination. Here you will find the most graphic details of mans inhumanity to man. Naked roll calls while shivering for hours exposed to the elements, being examined everywhere when entering the camp, having all body hair clipped off, using the same bucket to eliminate in and eat from, the sex at the camp, the cruelness of the officers and of fellow campmates who were trying to save themselves, the things some women would do for a crust of bread, the smell of the camp, the beatings....Olga spares no detail.<br /><br />It is not for the weak of stomach. You will feel the despair and wonder how man could ever be so cruel and pray that this never ever happens again.	2005-06-22

Over the years I have read a number of books on weight training. Most give you a routine, tell you how buff you are gonna look and toss in a picture or too. And they assume you know alot including proper form and what the heck the exercise is doing for your body.<br /><br />Maran's Illustrated Weight Training is different. This book will give you a firm grounding in weight training. It covers everything so you will have a solid foundation to train for best results.<br /><br />The book begins with something that is often missed in others - a picture of the human body with the muscles labeled. It is hard to work your \\"latissimus dorsi\\" or your \\"gluteu minimus\\"  terms I have heard video instructors shout out, when you don't have a clue what they are. Marans gives you a clearly labeled front and rear view human body illustration.<br /><br />Next the book makes the case for working out at home or at the gym. If you opt to set up a home gym you will learn what to look for in barbells, a bench, rack etc. If you opt to go to a gym you will learn what to look for before signing on the dotted line.<br /><br />The book also covers gym etiquette (something you wish that sweaty man next to you who never wipes down the bench would read), proper clothing, and more.<br /><br />Next comes the meat of the book. In great detail Marans describes how to work each part of your body. For your triceps for example Maran describes the bench dip, tricep kickback, triceps pushdown, barbell triceps press, dumbbell overhead extension, lying barbell extension and triceps extension machine. For each exercise you will learn what it does for your body, what muscles it works, and the do's and don'ts of performing it. Each excerise also includes lots of full color photographs.<br /><br />Tons of exercises are covered for upper and lower body - from chest to back to buttocks to calves. There is also a section on using an exercise ball and using tubing.<br /><br />I know a girl (ok it was me) who did ab work for several months with no results because she was doing the exercises wrong..too bad I didn't have this book then.<br /><br />The book also includes information on how to design a weight routine, stretching (crucial for best results and to prevent injury), cardiovascular training and nutrition.<br /><br />The softcover, oversized 300+ page book is beautifully laid out and designed. Full color photographs and easy to read text.<br /><br />Super book for those starting out, on their way or the seasoned pro seeking that extra information. Maran scores a winner with this book!<br /><br />Lee Mellottab work for several months with no results because she was doing the exercises wrong..too bad I didn't have this book then. <br /> <br />The book also includes information on how to design a weight routine, stretching (crucial for best results and to prevent injury), cardiovascular training and nutrition. <br /> <br />The softcover, oversized 300+ page book is beautifully laid out and designed.

Imagine a life where your parents describe homelessness as an exciting adventure. Where lunch has you checking the trash for other kid's leftovers. And where the toilet is a bucket in the middle of the room.<br /><br />Jeannette Wall's memoir is frightening, yet fascinating. The story begins with young Jeannette's visit to the emergency room suffering from deep burns due to a cooking accident. Jeannette had been making dinner at the tender age of 3, a typical daily affair despite her young age.<br /><br />Raised by eccentric parents, Jeannette tells the tale without whining or asking for sympathy. Her dad drank too much but shared his genius in other ways. At Christmas for example, there was no money for gifts but her dad \\"gave\\" her a star which he said would last forever - much longer than the traditional kids Xmas toy. Her mom was an artist who had better things to do than care for kids so the kids pretty much raised themselves. When there was money they ate and when there wasn't they didn't. When they ate, the mom might cook a pot of beans which served as breakfast, lunch and dinner for as long as it lasted.<br /><br />Jeannette's tale is an amazing look at an incredibly difficult childhood. A page turner - very hard to put down.	2005-06-09

From US Weekly magazine comes \\"US Secrets of Celebrity Style: A Crash Course in Dressing Like the Stars\\". This is a nifty oversized, softcover that focuses on how the stars dress to look good and grab attention and how you can too.<br /><br />US Secrets reveals the classic elements that the stars have worn for years that are timeless in appeal and make people wonder - \\"Who is she?\\" The book starts with the white shirt. You see Ingrid Bergman wearing the classic in 1951 and Mary J. Bilge updating the white shirt look today. Other basics are covered like scarfs, sunglasses, the little black dress etc.<br />Then the book delves into occasions like what to wear to a summer wedding or how to ultra-glam up an evening. Celebrities of today are used with looks you can copy and get ideas from.<br />Vintage looks are shown with modern updates.<br /><br />The book also includes best bets for body styles,age style, accessories and more. What to do and what NOT to do are covered. Celebrities range from classic icons like Audrey Hepburn and Jackie O to the newly minted Paris Hilton and Tara Reid. Tons of celebs..Uma Thurman, Kirsten Dunst, Cameron Diaz, Reese Witherspoon, Kate Hudson, Selma Blair and more..(One caveat, though they have a special section on what to wear for your age, most of the celebs featured throughout the book are under 35.)<br /><br />The book is a good source for inspiration. My daughter loves fashion. Looking through the book we find different ways to wear the pieces she has in her wardrobe without spending a bundle.<br /><br />Jennifer Aniston is not a favorite of mine so I am not fond of the books cover. However, I read a comment in a magazine that said that though Ms. Aniston is not super attractive her total packaging ie grooming and clothes gives her a lot of star appeal. So that makes the cover understandable. Still I think a book on clothing and style could have had a better cover than a blow up of her face.<br /><br />Overall the book is a good read and packed with good tips and ideas.	2005-05-25

There have been many first person accounts of the concentration camps. Rena's story is among the most detailed and gripping.<br /><br />Rena as a young woman turned herself in as a Jew in order to prevent problems for a family that was helping her. Little did she know of the ordeal that lie ahead. And when I say ordeal that does not begin to describe the terrifying journey that Rena takes.<br /><br />In the camps, Rena is eventually reunited with her sister Danka and makes a promise to her (hence the title of the book) that if she (Danka) is to be killed Rena will go with her. They will die or live together. As the story unfolds you really grasp the utter evil of the Nazi's as they played their evil games with the prisoners. How Rena and Danka manage to escape deaths door on so many occasions is a miracle. But they do. Yet the pain and suffering they experience is unimaginable. And the pain and suffering of those who meet untimely, unthinkable torture and deaths is described too.<br /><br />Whenever I am tempted to whine or moan or b*tch about something, I think of Rena and Danka and their incredible endurance. It puts my problems in perspective. The book also has made me appreciate the little things, like a hot shower or good book, a warm meal or a lazy morning sleeping. Things that Rena and Danka never received but could only dream of.<br /><br />This is a graphic book, but one that can change your way of thinking of life. A truly bold tale that opens your eyes to the deepest evil and the strongest love.	2005-05-15

I love the title of Greger's book \\"Carbophobia: The Scary Truth About America's Low-carb Craze\\". However the book should have been titled \\"Carbophobia: The Scary Truth About Atkins\\" because in the book Greger's almost sole focus is on the problems with the Atkins diet. He mentions a few others very, very briefly, but for the most part this is a book about how harmful and misleading the Atkins plan can be.<br /><br />The cover is cute and creative. A cartoon couple stand in their kitchen gazing in horror at a slice of bread!<br /><br />Greger is a good writer. Though tackling alot of science the book is easy to follow, holds ones interest, and covers alot of ground. Greger has been very thorough in his research.<br /><br />The one area I was disappointed in is that Greger points to the Ornish diet as a successful one. Though Ornish may be a healthy diet, it is not a pleasurable one as it is very plain. I think Greger could have done a better job of mentioning healthy alternatives.<br /><br />The 162page softcover book really cracks down on the Atkins plan. Greger walks you through the side effects, faulty science, studies, etc. step by step. The first chapter explains how the Atkins diet is nothing more than a \\"modern twist on an antique food fad\\" Chapter two gets into the flawed science behind Atkins. Chapter three questions the effectiveness of eating the Atkins way and chapter four gets into the side effects. He also includes an addendum disputing claims made by the Atkins corporation. The end of the book has an extensive bibliography.<br /><br />A book that surely has the Atkins corporation worried about their \\"phoney baloney!\\"	2005-04-13

Each year Allan Borushek releases a new version of \\"The Doctor's Pocket Calorie, Fat & Carbohydrate Counter.\\" By issuing a new version each year Borushek is able to include the newest foods on the market and at fast food chains and restaurants.<br /><br />Though there are a number of calorie counting books on the market, I like Borusheks because it is user friendly. It includes some little photos and sketches, and uses color to highlight different food items so its much easier to use than other counters. In addition Borushek includes hints to reduce fat, weight control tips, a diabetes guide and more. Lots of super useful information.<br /><br />The book lists over 11,000 food items and 200 fast food chains and restaurants. For each item it includes calories, carbohydrates and fat. At the back of the book Borushek discusses other nutrients though these are not included for each item in the book. He discusses fiber, salt, protein, calcium and more.<br /><br />At 4x6x1/2 the book is sized nicely to tuck into your bag or briefcase. And with its low price point you may want to purchase several copies. I keep one in my car so I know what I am consuming if I go to a restaurant.<br /><br />The only drawback to the book in my opinion is dietician and health educator Borushek's face in a little crown on the cover. A little cheesy. But despite that the book is a winner.<br /><br />Borushek also has a nice website where he sells a calorie counting program for your PDA, PC and/or joining an online community. He also offers his database of foods which is continually updated free at the site [...]<br /><br />A very handy little book to have!	2005-04-07

Dr. Susan Okie has done exhaustive research into one of the most pressing medical issues of today - childhood obesity. The 322 page hardcover book explores the issues surrounding this problem that continues to grow.<br /><br />Obesity not only effects a child's self-esteem but can lead to medical problems; high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease and other conditions.<br /><br />In her book, Okie examines the causes and cures for obesity. Citing both nature and nurture, Okie gives true life examples of what people are doing to combat the problem. With over 22 million children considered to be \\"fat\\" in today's society, Okie looks at ways to lower the obesity rate.<br /><br />This book is a very valuable read for parents, health workers and others to recognize how rampant the problem is and what to do about it.

Health workers will appreciate the vast research Okie has done.<br /><br />Okie does skip around a little in the book which does interrupt the flow of the book ie in one paragraph she may jump from one idea to the next, but overall the book flows pretty well.

Jim Johnson a physical therapist has done extensive research to find what does and does not work for weight loss. He recaps his findings in this book, \\"The No-Beach, No-Zone, No-Nonsense Weight Loss Plan: A Pocket Guide to What Works\\".<br /><br />Using the studies Jim explains that bottomline weight loss is dependent on calories consumed and exercise helps. To lose weight you simply eat less and your body will gradually use up it's fat stores. Jim clearly explains how to figure out your caloric needs, basal energy expenditure, the truth about cellulite (yep you can be skinny with cellulite)and more.<br /><br />One big surprise was Jim's information on exercise. According to the studies Jim used, overweight women who exercise do not lose weight by exercising alone. In one study Jim shares a group of overweight women walked for 45 minutes 5 days a week and did not lose weight. This doesn't seem right to me. If you weigh around 155 you will burn about 250 calories in a brisk 30 minute walk. If calories are the bottomline in weight loss as Jim says, then you would lose weight - about 26 pounds a year. I also know women who have lost weight just by walking (albeit slowly) so I do have to question Jim on this one.<br /><br />What Jim does do is point to the facts that regardless of the type of diet you are on ...weight loss will result if calories in are lower that what you had been consuming.<br /><br />Another area of concern is Jim's comment that one day he stumbled across the \\"National Weight Control Registry\\".  Most people in the weight loss arena are fully aware of this organization which tracks winners at weight loss. Jim's lack of knowledge of this makes me realize that though he may have written the book to help others he may not have a solid grounding in the weight loss arena. Which leads me to ask what studies he missed that may contradict some of his work.<br /><br />Jim has an easy breezy writing style, and is very clear in his explanations.<br /><br />His book is a good primer for weight loss. Though the 138 page paperback is slim it contains a wealth of information. You will learn how to figure out if you are fat, how many calories you need to consume to stay fat or lose weight, how to count calories, how to fit in exercise without doing it formally, and more. Most importantly you will learn that regardless of what you do, The Zone, The South Beach, The Apple Diet, Weight Watchers etc. If you are losing its cus you are eating fewer calories!<br /><br />One good inclusion is how to get motivated. As Jim says most of us do know what to do, but don't do it. Jim has good suggestions on how to rethink things so you are motivated.<br /><br />All in all a good little resource if you need some help figuring out weight loss basics.

The book opens with inspiring quotes from Jill's clients. In the 17 chapters that follow, Jill explains exactly what thin people do that helps them stay that way. Though the 136 page book is slim, Jill gets right to the point instead of including the extra fluff many other \\"diet\\" books do. She doesn't spend time writing about why all the other diets out there (except hers) don't work and she avoids a lot of scientific, technical chatter. <br /> <br />Chapters include Thin People Don't Diet, Thin People Carry Snacks, Thin People Don't Go to Bed Full, Thin People Eat Fruits and Vegetables and more. <br /> <br />The bottomline is the commonsense that prevails throughout the book. If you want to lose weight and maintain it you will have to eat less and/or move more. Jill tells you simple ways to do this. I especially liked her information on walking. One thing Jill shares is that a 155 pound woman who adds 1/2 hour of walking to her daily routine with no other dietary changes can lose 26 pounds a year.

Famed diet doctor,Stephen Gullo charges $1,000 an hour to advise clients on how they can lose weight. Now his tips and techniques can be yours for the price of this book.<br /><br />The hardcover 318 page book is slim but it's definately quality content. The book is essentially two parts. The first section includes strategies to employ to keep yourself IN CONTROL and IN CHARGE when it comes to your food. Dr. Gullo describes 10 \\"Thin Commandments\\". These include tips such as; separate mood from food, structure gives control, slips should teach not defeat you etc.<br /><br />The tips are pretty common knowledge but the twist is the techniques Gullo shares to master them. For example with his tip, \\"strategy is stronger than willpower\\", Gullo suggests  you pop a sugar free cough drop or a breath strip to help you resist the bread basket in a restaurant. I tried this the other night when faced with a basket of crispy fried (read fattening) taco chips and voila..ate many less than I normally do.<br /><br />Gullo also shares foods that he has found give enormous bang for your calorie buck. As another reviewer pointed out, these foods are hard to find. He recommends a 16 calorie crispbread that is an appetite suppresent due to the fiber and is a nice crunchy food item to eat instead of say chips. I hunted high and low in my area and came up emptyhanded. Ended up mail ordering the breads to the tune of $49.50 plus shipping. He pushes these crispbreads so hard in the book as such a wonder food I had to ask the company when I ordered if Dr. Gullo had ownership or derived any monetary gain from the sale. (He does not.) He also recommends a delicious waffle that was also hard to find. BUT its really not Gullo's fault that these foods are hard to find. They are unique in what they offer and they can be very beneficial. He has a resource section so you will be able to order them.<br /><br />Mastering the strategies in the first section will help you get in control. In the second section Dr. Gullo shares his ABC turbocharged diet. This is definitely a low calorie diet with foods selected to help suppress appetite. He gives a choice of breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks. A typical day might be 2 hard boiled eggs with high fiber crackers for breakfast, a cajun fish fillet with spinach and veggies for lunch, a frozen stouffers entree for dinner with a side salad and several snacks such as a class of V-8, grapefruit or bowl of soup. The diet is definitely a diet. Personally I would rather eat more and lose weight slower and include treats like chocolate and wine. BUT Gullo's plan is only intended for 10 days to \\"turbocharge\\" you and appears healthy for those who are inclined to follow such a plan. It does not eliminate protein or fat or carbs like other plans.<br /><br />Once you have finished the 10 days you go into a maintenance plan which includes more goodies. Dr. Gullo also gives a list of his top 110 best low calorie foods on the market. Some of these items are \\"faux\\" foods that are not the best choice in my opinion such as fat free mayo. I would rather have a little of the real stuff that doesnt have all the chemicals in it free mayo does or just substitute mustard. But many of the foods are good and nutritious. The crispbreads have no sugar and may take some getting used to but with a little spread on them..are a very tasty snack. Other winners include Babybel Cheese Wedges, Thomas English Muffins and Starkist crabmeat. The list is really great.<br /><br />Gullo includes recipes in his book. angel cakes, raspberry souffle, organic turkey breast, cheese crepes etc. I made the eggplant parmegiana recently and it was excellent!<br /><br />Overall the book is a great resource of tips and techniques to help you achieve your weight loss goals!C turbocharged diet.

I stopped reading Vogue years ago. I dress simply in classic styles and have little interest in the fashions shown by Vogue and many other magazines. And Vogue seems out of touch with its readers with stodgy articles and clownish fashions. (I find Elle to be more fresh and appealing). But I am always interested in a good bio and decided to read about the mystery behind the woman at the helm of Vogue.<br /><br />It appears that Ms. Wintour was very \\"cool\\" from the get go. Nice when she needed to be but rarely covering her true frosty nature. Confident and collected she knew what she wanted from an early age and went after it.<br /><br />Ms. Wintour did not graduate from high school and does not write very well, according to the author..so luck, family background, a strong sense of fashion and animal agressiveness played a large role in her rise to the helm of Vogue's masthead.<br /><br />As I read throught the book, I couldnt help but be glad that I have no desire to enter the apparent competitiveness and cattiness that marks the world of fashion magazines. A cutthroat business where wearing the wrong shoes or skirt style will send smirks your way.<br /><br />As Anna climbs to the top you read about how she loses friends, alienates people (yet somehow many come back for more abuse),and tramples on others to get where she wants to be. All the while she appears to fascinate others with her cool demeanor and aloof attitude. She is portrayed by the author as a shallow individual whose interests center around herself and clothes and thats about it.<br /><br />The author is exhaustive in his research. As another reviewer pointed out, more photographs would have been nice.

I eagerly anticipated Dr. Hagbergs book \\"Stage Presence from Head to Toe\\", but found it very disappointing. As I read through the pages of the book, I felt like I was a first grader preparing for a school concert. I was looking for information on making THAT SPECIAL connection with the audience, but found little in this text.<br /><br />Basically the book tells you what you already know. Stand up straight (posture counts), dress appropriately, let your audience know you are glad they came, be respectful of other musicians, don't chew gum etc. During the performance for example she suggests you avoid wiping your mouth, tapping your toes, licking your lips, wringing or flexing your hands or fingers. These are very, very basic rules that anyone who walks on stage already knows and if they don't they are most likely in primary school and will learn them, when their teacher tells them in a few sentences what it takes Hagberg 107 pages to say.<br /><br />Sadly, there is nothing new or exciting in this book.	2005-03-07

This is a nice brisk 1 mile walk to get you moving. \\"The Morning Mile Plus Abs\\" pairs with another tape \\"The Evening Mile Plus Legs\\". Together the set is known as the sun and moon. Sun for the am walk and moon for the pm walk of course.<br /><br />In \\"The Morning Mile Plus Abs\\" walk Leslie and six of her usual gang of exercisers lead you through simple motions, sidesteps, marches, little kicks etc. The music is standard Leslie fare and very faint in the background. The set is a studio set with decorative windows and doors - very simple.<br /><br />Leslie uses the weighted balls near the end of the walk to add more of a workout. After a brief cooldown, there are 10 minutes of abdominal exercises.<br /><br />Overall this is a quick little workout to get you moving in the morning. Sometimes the camera angles are a little odd, off to a slant for example so I deducted one star. But other than that its a great walk and a nice alternative to her Miracle Mile or another one mile walk. I like to use this walk when I am short on time or after lunch when I want to walk off my sandwich!	2005-03-01

Dr. Barbara Rolls is one of the leading researchers on weight management. Through her studies she has been able to demonstrate that people can eat hundreds of calories less per day, lose weight and not feel deprived. Dr. Rolls shares her work in her new 316 page hardcover book, \\"The Volumetrics Eating Plan\\".<br /><br />The secret is what Dr. Rolls calls, \\"volumetrics\\". With volumetrics you are not micromanaging your nutrients ie eating no fat or eating a high protein diet, nor are you giving up favorite foods like chocolate, bread or cheese. With volumetrics you learn to choose foods that will help you control hunger, lose weight yet not be \\"on a diet\\".<br /><br />In studies Dr. Rolls conducted she discovered the foods that provide the most \\"bang\\" for your calorie buck. In her first book \\"The Volumetrics Weight - Control Plan\\" she described the science behind her research. In this book she goes further and describes how to implement these techniques in your daily life.<br /><br />Dr. Rolls found in test studies that subjects could eat up to 800 calories LESS per day and not even notice the difference if they made the right choices.<br /><br />You will learn how to choose the right foods that will help you lose weight without dieting and feelings of depriviation. Volumetrics involves energy density. Dr. Rolls categorizes foods according to their density. Density is based on amount of calories per gram of food.  These categories range from Catergory 1 the least energy dense (green beans, celery, lettuce etc.) to Catergory 2 (olives, ketchup, rice etc.) to category 3 (raisins, hard pretzels, oil packed tuna etc.) to catergory 4 - high energy dense foods (bacon, butter, pecans etc.) If you select the lower energy dense foods most of the time and add in select portions of the high energy dense foods you will lose weight. Though it sounds complicated, Dr. Rolls explains it so thoroughly its very easy to understand and once you get the hang of it, you will know exactly what foods to choose more of and whant to choose less of.<br /><br />Dr. Rolls includes a number of delicious recipes also. Her Thai Chicken Salad is perfection! Other yummy recipes include oven roasted potatoes, shrimp creole, stir fried turkey with crunchy veggies, pork chops with orange soy sauce and charlie's greek salad.<br /><br />She also includes a simple walking plan that will enhance your weight loss even further. Simple ways to increase your steps. Dr.Rolls teaches you how to determine your baseline walking and work up from there. A nice bonus to the book!<br /><br />The beauty of \\"The Volumetrics Eating Plan\\" is you learn how to incorporate all the foods you love like chocolate, cheese, pizza etc volumetrically so you can eat them and lose weight!<br /><br />She also includes several weeks of menu plans. These are simple to understand with easy to find ingredients. One drawback is that a whole weeks worth of menus are on one page so its a bit hard to read. Other than the weekly menu plans which are squished on a page, the rest of the book is generously laid out with easy to read text and lots of full color photographs.<br /><br />The one weak area in the book is the lack of success stories. Though Dr. Rolls shares a few letters she has received from clients, I would like to have seen more letters and some before and after photographs.<br /><br />Overall, the book is excellent and clearly explains how you can have your cake and lose weight too!what foods to choose more of and whant to choose less of.  <br /> <br />Dr. Rolls includes a number of delicious recipes also.

NOTE: This review is for Denise Austin's DVD Shrink Your Female Fat Zones - a companion to the book.<br /><br />Denise Austin's \\"Shrink Your Female Fat Zones\\" is an effective tape that can be split into two 20 minute sessions or one 40 minute workout.<br /><br />Women are often told that to prevent bone loss, we should workout with weights, but many tapes on the market are overwhelming. They use very heavy weights, are very long, lack clear directions or are just plain boring.<br /><br />Denise's tape gives you a simple workout that you can do 3-4 times a week to build strength, preserve bone density and get toned.<br /><br />The first section is a simple 20 minute light weight routine. You will do a few pushups, lat rows, light ab work, bicep work etc. Very simple. No jumping around. Clear direction. The second session adds in the balance ball. The ball is not included in the tape but is sold by places like Wal-mart for under $20.00. With the ball you work your core, legs and more.<br />Pick one or both workouts depending on your mood and needs.<br /><br />The setting is a studio with a calm background, one that will not date in the future. Denise leads the exercises with a small group of exercisers behind her, following her directions. It would have been nice if Denise had included some older exercisers, but she didnt. The music is relaxing. Though Denise is her usual chatty self she is not overbearing. Denise uses the same set of weights throughout the workout which could be a drawback for those who like to vary their weights as there is not a lot of time to change poundage.<br /><br />My goal is not to be a fitness buff, but to be healthy, strong and slender. I don't want to kill myself working out but recognize that in addition to aerobic activity (which this tape is not) I need weight bearing activity. This tape is just the perfect fit for my needs.	2005-01-10

I picked up this book at the beginning of the year after reading rave reviews in hopes but not truly expecting it to help my mindset. Each year I set goals and though I may accomplish one or two..generally the next year I am setting the same goals.<br /><br />By the time I had completed the first half of the book my way of thinking had changed. I completed the exercises as I read the book.<br /><br />You begin by listing your goals. Then you decide which is more important and finally which is MOST important. It seems so simple yet the way the author teaches you to do this gave me greater success than other methods.<br /><br />I was really surprised to find what my most desired goal was. I thought it was something else. But by following the exercises I realized a I had a strong desire to accomplish another goal I never realized was the most important to me. Next you work towards accomplishing your goal.<br /><br />McCarthy uses the image of a light switch. If you are switched on you are working towards your goals. Conversely if you are not you are not ON PURPOSE.<br /><br />Within days I was accomplishing tasks to help me achieve many of my goals! An excellent book and most highly recommended!	2005-01-07

The book design is unusual. It is a an oversized 10\\" by 9\\" soft cover book with a stiff book jacket cover making it a cross between a hard cover and soft cover book.<br /><br />The text is illustrated with line drawings and a number of photographs (mostly black and white). It helps you learn to THINK like a French woman. It will help you learn to make the decisions a French woman would when shopping, dressing, playing and more.<br /><br />French woman are known for their chic appearance and attitude. Within these pages Vienne who was born and raised in France conveys what it is that makes the French woman so stylish. She begins by looking to the past. A look at how the French fashion evolved. Then she shares the purebred classics that make the French look - items such as the supreme black turtleneck, hermes scarf, red gloves etc.<br /><br />Vienne encourages you to \\"epater les bourgeois\\" that is shock say a French matron. Here is where you wear things that will raise the eyebrow such as a sweater turned inside out, sunglasses in the rain etc. As Vienne says \\"you cannot have style without breaking the rules\\".  Take what you have and add little twists to make it special and give it style.<br /><br />In the States we dress \\"appropriately\\" in France a French woman will push buttons - be surprising and fresh.<br /><br />Vienne gives a list of \\"do's\\" and \\"don'ts\\" and she gets into \\"Le Shopping\\". Armed with more attitude than cash the French woman will use her wits and savvy to find the very best.<br /><br />Like the design itself this book is very unusual. Not your usual dress like this fare. This is a book that goes beyond the obvious of what is style and helps explain the mystery of how to make style yours.<br /><br />French style is not a trend, it's a way of life. A way of thinking and feeling. Veronique captures that in this book!<br /><br />Lee Mellott> <br />Lee Mellott	2005-01-05

I was so impressed with Madame Guiliano's book \\"French Women Don't Get Fat\\" (see my review posted at Amazon) I decided to ante up for the audio version also. Because the book was so good, I felt that HEARING her words would make an even greater impression even though it is the same material so I purchased the CD in addition to the book.<br /><br />The CD is an abridged version of the book read by the author herself Mireille Guilino. Madame Guiliano was born and raised in France but spent many years in the States. She reads the text with her charming French accent but it is very clear. She reads at just the right speed. Very nice!<br /><br />The audio varies from the book with a few new ideas here and there. And to hear Madame say the words does make a further impression as I had hoped. There are a few differences from the book however.<br /><br />The audio is spread out over 3 CD's in an attractive compact box. The drawback to the set is it does not include all the recipes the book does. She reads one recipe for magical leek soup and the box includes a few extra recipes on cards but many recipes are not included. In the book she includes recipes for yogurt which she feels is VERY beneficial to weight loss and also a recipe for french baguettes. Sadly these very important recipes are not included in the CD set.<br /><br />The third CD boasts a bonus interview with Ms. Guiliano that the book does not have. Here she is asked about fast food, eating on the run etc.<br /><br />Both the CD and book are wonderful with plenty of commonsense advise as to how a French woman thinks in order to stay slim and how you can adapt this to your American lifestyle. It is geared more towards those who have 30 pounds or fewer to lose and also to females.<br /><br />Aside from the recipe changes and bonus interview the CD is very similar to the book in content so please read my review of the book for more information on actual content.<br /><br />Given the choice of the book or CD, I think I would have to select the book due to the very important yogurt and bread recipes..yet the opportunity to hear Madame herself is exquisite!<br /><br />If selecting just one you will have to decide then what is most important to you.<br /><br />Bonne Chance!<br /><br />Lee Mellottk or CD, I think I would have to select the book due to the very important yogurt and bread recipes..yet the opportunity to hear Madame herself is exquisite!  <br /> <br />If selecting just one you will have to decide then what is most important to you.  <br /> <br />Bonne Chance! <br />Lee Mellott <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-01-01

And with her commonsense explanation M. Guliano explains exactly how to do this.<br /><br />Madame Guiliano is not a doctor or nutritionist. And she has not done scientific studies to test her methods. BUT all she has to do is point to France and the millions of slim Frenchwomen who use her \\"methode\\".<br /><br />Madame Guiliano states she learned the process of weight loss when she gained weight after a visit to the States from her Doctor - Dr. Miracle. The good doctor taught her simple steps to achieve a healthy weight.

In fact the author warns you to stay far away from low carb diets but the diet he shares looks very similar (with the exception of the addition of protein powder) to the \\"South Beach Diet\\" to me.<br /><br />The diet tries to include women but it really is geared to men. The vitamin recommended is for men. The actual menu plan is a one size fits all for men (no difference for women). And then the author claims that the Abs Diet is built around foods you crave - peanut butter, roasted pork loin and lobster. DAVID! What are you thinking? Yes men tend to crave meat but a majority of women crave chocolate and bread (chocolate is not included in the diet)! His advise to use instant oatmeal rather than the oldfashioned type is also surprising as instant is supposed to cause blood sugar surges.<br /><br />David claims that most people when following the plan will be able to see definition in their abs within 6 weeks. But David, doesnt share that most women will never have defined abs because most women have a natural curve to their bodies and they would have to have a very low percentage of body fat to get that lean to show definition which is rare.<br /><br />David does explain cholesterol and some other medical issues in very simple terms. Kudos to him for that. But some of his explanations were more opinions than based on actual fact.  The<br />diet is so much of a diet with protein shakes and similar meals each day, salads and turkey and so lacking in pleasure that I am not sure people can stay on it for a long term. He even says on page 104 \\"Heck I don't care if you eat the same thing every day for a week.\\" which pretty much sums up the meal plan ..BORING.<br /><br />BTW recipes are not exactly enticing either from p. 142 `\\"Smear the mayo on the tortilla\\".<br /><br />David does give you permission to cheat once a week which is curious as this is not supposed to really be a diet according to the book but a way of life despite the title.<br /><br />To give credit David has been associated with \\"Men's Health\\" for years and he has a very comprehensive section on exercise. But he states that you lose more weight with lifting weights than you do with an aerobic activity such as running. Again I disagree, take a look at runners - most are very slim. Compare that to bodybuilders. I am not saying lifting weights is a bad thing just that running will burn flab off faster.<br /><br />The book also includes some good testimonials ie \\"I turned flab into muscle\\" but alas no supporting before and after pictures.ok but a way of life despite the title.

A cute woman with a cheeky grin and the appearance of not a care in the world. So when you read her story you are struck by how deceiving appearances are.<br /><br />\\"Beautiful Stranger\\" is the true story of how Hope Donahue was totally immersed and obsessed with her appearance. She studied woman's magazines for the latest potions promising perfection. Spent hours ruminating over her \\"flaws\\". And countless time and money in the plastic surgeons office having one procedure after another.<br /><br />She has her nose worked on, eyelift, cheek implants, breast surgery and more. In addition she doesn't give much thought to eating her roommates food and snooping through their drawers. Hope eventually is diagnosed with OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) and takes medication. She marries and has children.<br /><br />Sadly though she admits near the end of the book that she still has the problem as she has had her eyebrows tatooed twice, a birthmark put on and removed, botox, collegen etc.<br /><br />I felt great pity for the author. I want to say, \\"Hope, beauty is not all there is to life. And even if you are beautiful so what? It doesn't make you happier inside as witnessed by the super models like Gia who kill themselves or become addicted to drugs to ease depression. Regardless my comments would most likely not help Hope who seems driven now and then by urges she can't control.<br /><br />I greatly admire Hope's gut wrenching honesty.

The title is not sexy, there are no exciting visuals, weight loss is not fast.  Thus many people ignored it and hopped on the \\"diet of the week\\" bandwagon.<br /><br />Yet \\"The Volumetrics Weight-Control Plan\\" by Rolls and Barnett is one of the best, easiest to follow \\"diet\\" plans on the market. And it is backed up by research.<br /><br />The plan is simple. On a daily average most people eat about the same weight of food. That weight could have a caloric value of 1500 calories or 2500 calories depending on what you select to eat. Rolls and Barnett teach you to eat lower calorie but  high satiety foods by increasing the water rich foods in your diet. Foods like fruits and vegetables. These will fill you up and thus you will eat less.<br /><br />For example you could eat Italian Pasta Salad with a lot of veggies and for 200 calories eat TWICE as much as Italina Pasta Salad thats heavy on the rotini.  You could eat one 60 calorie cookie in a snap or eat one juicy water filled apple for the same amount of calories over a longer period of time. You get more food for the same calories. Because you are eating more food you will over the course of the day eat less and thus your calories will be lower and you will over time lose weight.<br /><br />Rolls and Barnett give plenty of recipes, substitutions, and suggestions to help you easily accomplish your goals. Try it today. Have a cup of soup or an apple prior to eating lunch. Thise foods are filling and you will eat less of the energy dense foods like chips and candy.<br /><br />An easy to understand, excellent plan for good health and weight loss!	2004-11-05

Let me begin by saying I am glad I am not the author Lisa Sander's sister. Poor Shelley must be gnashing her teeth over Lisa's willingness to share sister Shelley's personal weight loss problems. But share she does and Shelley is one of the few real life examples given in the book. Which makes one wonder if the author successfully tested her theory and followed up to see if lost weight stayed lost.<br /><br />The author claims that different people lose weight on different types of diets. The goal then is to find the correct diet for you. After journaling and answering questions you will be given your \\"perfect fit\\" diet.<br /><br />The diet may be a counting calories diet, low carb diet or low fat diet. This diet is then tailored to suit your needs.<br /><br />I have several problems with the book. The first is that she categorizes diets according to how weight loss is accomplished on pp 28-29. For example Dr. Ornish's diet helps people according to Sanders because they eat low fat. Sugar Busters limits carbs as does Dr. Atkins. Then she says that American Heart Association and Weight Watchers are low calorie. BUT here the author misses the point. ALL OF THE DIETS WORK BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW CALORIE. Not because they are low fat or low carb..but because you are eating less. So to say you can lose weight because you are eating low carb is inaccurate. To say you can lose weight because you are eating less calories because you are eating low carb and hence cutting calories is accurate.<br /><br />So then we get to the type of diet themselves. Yes Atkins may help you lose weight but is it a healthy diet long term? Yes the Ornish plan of VERY limited fats will help you lose weight but fat free is a pretty joyless plan. Yes the Zone plan can help you shed fat but can you stick to it long term.<br /><br />So here Dr. Sanders advocates picking one of these diets and she helps you choose it BUT can you do it LONG-TERM?<br /><br />And if you are going to go on a low carb diet or low fat diet, why not just pick up the ORIGINAL diet book which will have more recipes and information? Because Sanders thinks you don't know what type of diet will work for you. But most of us have been around the diet block and know what works for us and what doesn't. And most of us know that most of these plans don't work long-term because they are hard to stick too. Who wants to count calories the rest of their life?<br /><br />My thought is make small changes in your diet. Eat less of what you eat now. If you eat a lot of sugar cut back so you don't get the strong sugar urges. Walk more. Make simple changes. Weight loss will be slow but it will stay off!low fat diet, why not just pick up the ORIGINAL diet book which will have more recipes and information?

Surveying the mound of cups in the trashcan near her desk  she realized that if she subsituted a travel mug for her styrofoam cup she would save the landfill 72 hundred styrofoam cups over a twenty year period! She realized that simple changes can make a big difference. If we all make small changes we can make a tremendous impact.<br /><br />The Urbanska's cover money, time, work, child rearing, community and more. They make suggestions to enrich your life and simplify. For transportation for example they recommend choosing ways to travel that do not involve air transportation because though only .5 percent of the total distance people travel each year is done by air, planes take up 5 percent of transportation energy. They recommend carpooling, observing the speed limit, checking the air pressure in your tires to promote fuel efficiency and other simple changes to help our environment and our life.<br /><br />Though I agreed with many of the authors suggestions a few I felt were off base. For example they recommend you limit yourself to one credit card. If you can't manage your credit perhaps you should only have one or none for that matter. But most people need more than one to establish a good credit rating. If you only have one card you will not get the best rates for a mortgage as one card does not show you can handle credit. In addition, its good to have more than one card so you have a back up. When we traveled to Mexico, our credit company would not approve a charge we made for a once in a lifetime swim with the dolphins because of possible fraud. We were unable to contact them to get the charge approved. Fortunately we had another card to use. When we were in New Orleans and my purse was snatched one card was left in the room and good thing because the other card had to be canceled due to its theft. What would we have paid for the room with? But as I mentioned earlier the main reason for more than one card is to establish good credit and get the best possible rates.<br /><br />The Urbanskis also urge you to buy used goods like clothing. They suggest doing this because once you have purchased an item it decreases in value by 20%. Let me say that regardless of depreciation if I find a wonderful outfit that looks and feels good and is within my budget, its worth every cent.  I would rather have one fine quality garment from Nordstroms or Neimans purchased to fit me and look good on me than a ton of thrift shop items. (And I am not referring to the upscale thrifts with the slightly worn clothing) I am referring to the thrifts where Frank Urbanski buys jeans that dont stay zipped in order to save a buck (ok ok he didnt realize they didnt stay zipped). Buy less but buy the best.<br /><br />Ditto on the avoid status purchases. Though some status purchases are just plain silly. There is often a reason why a product has status. Because its quality and well made. The Urbanskis question why someone would buy a status item giving Coach as an example. Well I will tell you why. I bought a black leather Coach pocket book for around $160. It was a beautiful black soft leather. It looked good. It felt good. I toted that pocketbook around for 13 years! Thats about $12 per year or $1 a month. My sister bought several pocketbooks each year! Why because they fell apart or stopped looking fashionable. But she refused to pay for a good one. She spent way more than I did and the bag on her arm didnt look anywhere near as good.<br /><br />Bottomline buy cheap and weep. When my husband and I married we decided to buy the best we could afford and if we couldnt we did without. We have used that rule ever since. As a result the things we have last years and look wonderful and we enjoy them!<br /><br />So I do think the Urbanskis miss the mark on certain things. But the concept of doing more with less and making small changes is a powerful one that should be heard. So kudos to the Urbanskis for sharing their thoughts and Wanda I would give you my old Coach so you could avoid buying a new pocketbook but I sold it at a yard sale. The lady bought it because she said \\"It was a Coach and they are known for their fine quality!\\"<br /><br />Lee Mellottem! <br /> <br />So I do think the Urbanskis miss the mark on certain things.

I enjoy functional yet eye-catching rooms with a feel of luxury to the space - comfortable and classy ....So when I came across the book \\"The Organized Home: Design Solutions for Clutter-Free Living\\" it immediately appealed to me.<br /><br />The book is filled with lavish photographs of beautiful rooms that are pleasing to the eye. But the rooms go beyond the pretty/decorator look because each is designed with simple solutions to organize the space so the home becomes a refuge from our hectic lifes. It becomes a place of peace. Organized and restful.<br /><br />Though I have read a number of organization books, this one introduced me to some lovely new ideas. How to use a tansu(or chest), how screens can be used to hide and divide, why you should always have a mirror in the hallway and much more.<br /><br />The hardcover book 10\\" by 8\\" with its glossy cover is pretty to place on the coffee table and so packed with solutions you will refer to it constantly. It includes chapters on organizing by design, creating a first impression, adding life to the living room, creating a double duty dining room, taming childrens rooms and taking a fresh look at laundry and mud rooms among others.<br /><br />Each chapter takes an indepth look to give you tips and techniques to make your home glow. One of my favorites is the kitchen section. In this section the authors teach you how to cut clutter, plan for get togethers, organize your kitchen gear and display collections. The nitty gritty is covered not just surface information. Not only are you given quick and easy ways to increase your storage for example you are also encouraged to label your spices with the date of purchase, rotate your dishes and take inventory of your cutlery. Little things that make your kitchen function at its best. And this is done room by room.<br /><br />A super read, packed with information and very inspiring!<br /><br />Lee Mellott	2004-10-22

According to the authors the average American will gain a little bit of weight each year. You can prevent this gain by adding 2000 steps to your daily walking. To lose weight you add more steps and cut back on what you eat.<br /><br />These simple changes can be made one at a time and add up to permanent change thats easy to incorporate into your everyday life.<br /><br />The book teaches you how to determine your current average step amount and increase it week to week. There is also a chart to show how to convert other activities into steps so you can track all of your activities. Information is included on how to make minor dietary adjustments so you can reap the reward of a fitter, slimmer body.<br /><br />Overall the book is excellent at helping the reader learn how to regulate weight through step activity. The authors do however confuse the issue with \\"megasteps\\". The authors help you determine your megasteps and then at the back of the book they list common foods and tell you how many megasteps each food is equal to. For example an egg will cost you approximately one megastep. praline ice cream about 6. This is just another way of calorie counting and really not needed in the book in my opinion.<br /><br />Instead it would have been nice if the authors had included the number of steps you would have to walk to burn off certain foods. For example to burn up an order of small fries (210 calories) you would have to walk about 4,200 steps. This type of information in the book would have been great. But it's not included.<br /><br />A pedometer comes with the book. As others have noted here I personally have and would recommend that others purchase a better quality, more accurate pedometer.<br /><br />The book is linked to the americaonthemove.org website and its GREAT! A lot of information on walking for individuals or groups. You can set goals at the site. For example you can pick a trail like the Lewis and Clark trail which requires you step about 9,000 paces a day. Each day you record your steps and see visually how far you are on the map and your average steps, plus you can read about the area. What fun and its free!<br /><br />Overall, the book is a \\"breath of fresh air\\" with it's focus on making small changes in eating and increasing walking activity (not killing yourself with intense exercise programs) to see big results.duals or groups.

This is a terrific source for selecting your next \\"love song\\" to sing, or play on the guitar or piano.<br /><br />My daughter is a 15 year old singer. There are many songs here that she may not have considered singing because she had never heard of them, as they date from before she was born. This helps broaden her selection base. The book includes recent songs also.<br /><br />There are 100 hits that range from 1965, The Righteous Brothers \\"Unchained Melody\\" to several from 2001 like Alicia Keys, \\"Fallin'\\" and Sade's \\"\\"By Your Side\\".  And lots in-between from the cutesy 1970 Partridge Family hit \\"I think I Love You\\" to the rockin' Cheap Trick \\"I Want You to Want Me\\" number to the classic Roberta Flack, \\"The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face\\".<br /><br />The book includes songs from female artists like Madonna, Shania Twain, and Toni Braxton, male artists like Barry Manilow, Peter Frampton and Andy Gibb, and groups like the Bangles, Guns N' Roses and Poison. There are also several duets with artists including Neil Diamond and Barbra Streisand's \\"You Don't Bring Me Flowers\\", Sonny & Cher's, \\" I Got You Babe\\" and Bill Medley & Jennifer Warnes,\\"The Time of My Life\\".<br /><br />The price is very reasonable too. For around $4.95 a pop I can purchase sheet music that I print myself over the web or buy at the store. Or for the price of 5 songs I can purchase this bound book with 100 songs!<br /><br />The book is thick and oversized. If you need to copy a song from the book you will want to use legal size paper.<br /><br />VH1's \\"100 Greatest Love Songs\\" lists the year of each song which makes it interesting. What were you doing in 1998 when the Goo Goo Dolls \\"Iris\\" was a  hit. Do you recall one of the top hits of  1984? (Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time\\") The book also ranks the songs from 1-100 with Whitney Houston's 1982, \\"I Will Always Love You\\" claiming the top spot and Poison's \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\" at 100.<br /><br />Hopefully in the future they will have another book and my daughter, Jessica will be in it with a top song!<br /><br />Lots of good songs for your $!ll have another book and my daughter, Jessica will be in it with a top song!  <br /> <br />Lots of good songs for your $!	2004-10-06

There is a comprehensive food plan and exercise plan. What he says for the most part is eat a healthy diet and exercise and you can feel and look better in 4 weeks. He also debunks other programs like the one that claims you can get fit in 8 minutes a day.<br /><br />Joe Decker is in the Guinness Book of World Records holding the title of the World's Fittest Man. Joe completed an ultimate athletic circuit that included a number of events like running, kayaking, Nordic track, swimming etc. to earn his title. He feels that everybody can challenge themselves to a better body.<br /><br />Despite Joe's obvious desire to help others I just found the book lacking. Joe says DONT DIET. But he tells you what to eat and for women its a 1400 calorie a day plan that includes foods like egg beaters, reduced calorie dressing, lo-fat cheese etc. Sounds like a diet to me! For the most part the food items included are healthy ones. But there is no room for treats like chocolate of which a fine quality bon-bon can be healthy in moderation or say a small scoop of ice cream which is also fine in moderation. He also tells you to drink water to get filled up. But studies done by Dr. B. Rolls show that drinking water does NOT fill you up. Eating water rich foods like grapes does.<br /><br />Next he gets into an exercise plan. He encourages women to use heavy weights stating that this will make them sleek and sexy. Not true. If you take a look at females who use heavy weights they do build bulk and a lot of muscle that many females do not want. At one time I also believed this till I noticed how bulky I got using heavy weights. Now I use light weights and more repititions for better results.<br /><br />Joe also busts fitness myths that people believe. But many of these myths have been \\"busted\\" so many times that its old news. For example he says you can't spot tone. How often do we have to read that we all think we can spot tone? He also recommends supplements glucosamine and chondroitin which are not FDA approved for safety.<br /><br />The exercise program and the diet program are intense. And you are expected to jump in right away. No easing into anything here.<br /><br />Throughout the book Joe also refers to things with a \\"World's Fittest Man\\" prefix as in \\"World's Fittest Man Catfish Creole\\" recipe - this gets annoying.<br /><br />I can see that Joe put a lot of effort into the book but its really only for those who are ready to knock themselves out which usually lasts about 2 weeks and then its back to coach potatodom.<br /><br />There are some good reviews here of his book, but interestingly enough they are mostly by \\"a reader\\" and all around the same time frame.<br /><br />My suggestion would be to take a more sensible approach one step at a time that will be longer lasting.He also recommends supplements glucosamine and chondroitin which are not FDA approved for safety. <br /> <br />The exercise program and the diet program are intense.

I was so impressed with Victoria Wizell's \\"Ultimate Weight Loss Power Pack\\" that I decided to try hpnosis for \\"Anxiety Relief\\".<br /><br />Among her many qualifications, Wizell is a master hypnotherapist and neurolinquistic programming practiioner. She uses these skills in this 2 CD pack to teach you techniques to overcome anxiety.<br /><br />The focus in the 2CD set is on managing panic problems. It is hard to describe the feelings one has when they experience a panic attack. Incredible discomfort that may include thoughts of dying, fainting or having a heart attack. Sweating, palpitations, dizziness - a virtual potpourri of emotional pain for the sufferer.<br /><br />Victoria suffered from panic attacks and understands what the sufferer goes through. Using her personal experiences and skills she has developed the CD's to enable the user to take back control and embrace the peace within.<br /><br />The sessions teach different breathing techniques, how to eliminate hyperventilation, muscle relaxation, reframing, anchoring, anxiety as an object and positive affirmations. My favorite involved imagining a ball of golden light surging through out my body and filling me with peace and relaxation.<br /><br />I did not care for the cover of the CD box. It features a woman who is anxious looking and one who is relaxed. Please next time just show the relaxed one! But its whats inside that counts and the CD's are excellent. The background music is light and calming. At the beginning of the CD when Victoria explains panic her words are a little rushed but after that her voice is perfect. Calming and relaxing. Victoria has an amazing voice that soothes and comforts and imparts confidence to the user.<br /><br />Because I found the CD's so helpful I checked out Victorias' site hyptalk and found she has other CD's (not listed on Amazon) that cover other areas. Driving has been a major problem for me due to a bad experience. There is nothing like driving up the road feeling like you are going to pass out, especially when your kids are in the car. After just one session with the driving tape, I felt so much better. A wonderful difference. Though I could work through the problem with the Anxiety Relief CD's alone, the Driving Anxiety tape has given me more excellent techniques to use.<br /><br />I would definately recommend you purchase and use Victoria's CD's to make incredible changes in your life!d feeling like you are going to pass out, especially when your kids are in the car.

Chapters include skin care, makeup, lips, body, hair care, teeth and more. The chapter on nails for example details the different nail products on the market, walks you step by step through a manicure and pedicure, discusses nail health - problems and solutions and explores nail color selection.<br /><br />Though there are a number of beauty books on the market, \\"Instyle Getting Gorgeous\\" explores most topics to a greater degree than most others. In the chapter on hair for example, hair style is covered as is the norm but so is hair health and how to trim your own bangs. The skin care selection includes the basics but goes beyond with info on the very latest cosmetic procedures and how to give yourself a facial. Fragrance, \\"the ultimate accessory of fashion\\" is also explored so you can not only look terrific but smell delicious too. Tons of info on all aspects of looking gorgeous here!<br /><br />Photographs in the book are of celebrities. This is Instyle's focus so you will see Kate Hudson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Beyonce Knowles etc but you will not see ordinary every day women. These women are lovely to begin with but they also have learned how to accent their best features and the book points to how they do this. I really enjoyed the section that demonstrates how celebrities change their look and the mood by simply using a different lip color. Little celeb secrets that we can incorporate into our own look to add pizazz!<br /><br />The book is loaded with step by step illustrations, secrets of the pros, questions and answers, best product choices - and more. \\"Instyle Getting Gorgeous\\" is the book to have to answer all your beauty questions and help you glow!<br /><br />Lee Mellott	2004-09-28

That adds up to a shocking 14 days a year!<br /><br />\\"Real Simple: The Organized Home\\" will help you declutter, maximize space, and decorate your interior. By following the tips and techniques you will as the book says, \\"live beautifully with maximum efficiency and minimum effort\\".<br /><br />Don't feel you have to tackle projects all at once. With a little effort each day you will eventually have the serene space that envelops you with comfort and warmth.<br /><br />The beautiful, crisp photographs in the 192 page, 11\\" by 9\\" hardcover book inspire and delight. The photos range from soft, creamy bathroom shots to organized closets teaming with color. I love the photos throughout the book but will say I thought the book's cover shot and design was not the best choice.<br /><br />Chapters in the book include the foyer, living room, family room, kitchen, dining room, bedroom, storage room and more. Step by step you are enticed to make your home over. The bathroom section for example, walks you through  basic needs like what to look for in a towel, space saving devices and how to organize it all. A variety of organization tips are given throughout the book that range from when to toss mascara to how long butter keeps in the refridgerator.<br /><br />I love the idea of a spa-type atmosphere in my home. Plump pillows in the bedroom with fine linens dressing the bed,a fragrant smell like lavender lingering in the air, wholesome, tasty food in the kitchen with the proper tools to prepare it....<br /><br />Simple pleasures and ones that are within anyones reach when they learn simple solutions to organized living.

Even though you know what to eat, know you should exercise and know you should incorporate other healthy habits in your day to day life, the mental game of weight loss is often the most difficult.<br /><br />This is where hypnosis can be very beneficial. By speaking to your subconscious mind you can make weight loss much easier. You can learn to WANT to eat right. WANT to exercise. WANT to drink more water etc. Instead of fighting desires for processed foods and to swill soda or to retire in front of the TV, you can easily learn to desire healthier choices. To this end master hypnotist Victoria Wizell has created the \\"Ultimate Weight Loss Power Pack\\".<br /><br />The \\"Ultimate Weight Loss Power Pack\\" is a 7 CD set, that comes packaged in a tidy, compact 7 and 1/2\\" by 2\\" case. The CD's walk you through 12 weeks of change. You will learn how to hypnotize yourself using several different techniques including progressive relaxation and my favorite, stepping down the stairs into a sea of clouds. At the beginning of the program Victoria will help you set goals. Then each week you will learn how to accomplish these goals by overcoming the internal programming that has been holding you back and by learning new habits.<br /><br />One week your focus may be learning to detect physical versus pschological hunger. Other sessions include turning up your metabolism, healthy eating, exercising, reshaping your body, drinking water and more. My favorite session was \\"accessing the cause\\". After completing this CD, I was surprised to find a far greater understanding of why I had put on extra pounds to begin with - the reason was not what I had always thought it was!<br /><br />When you have completed the CD's Victoria has included a maintenance session. You can also go back to certain areas that need more work, and use the program to truly focus on a specific area. I for example, am a regular exerciser so do not feel the need to put a lot of time into that CD but despite the exercise feel that my metabolism is somewhat sluggish, so I am spending more time with the \\"turn up your metabolism\\" CD.<br /><br />Over the years I have listened to a number of hypnotic tapes, including weight loss ones. Of the tapes I have listened too, Victoria's are without a doubt the finest and most effective available. To begin with she has a very melodious, soothing voice. It's restful and very peaceful. You enjoy listening to it. With other tapes the speakers often sound rushed, or have a raspy or unpleasant voice. Victoria's voice sets you at ease. It's very beautiful. The content of her program is excellent and because of the way it is written, it will work regardless of what eating style you choose to do with it!<br /><br />This program has a few minor baubles - at the beginning she has you write down limiting and positive beliefs and its a bit confusing when to do what. She also refers to the program as a 12 month instead of 12 week one in the maintenance section, but these are very minor issues.<br /><br />The core of the program is indepth work into changing your inner self so you can finally release the weight forever!<br /><br />This is an intense program. For maximum results you wlll want to work with it every day. If you are only 5 or 10 pounds overweight you may want to try one of Victoria's other CD's. But if you need to lose more or seem to lose and regain the same 5 or 10 pounds over and over, then you may want to really get to the root of the problem and complete the \\"Power Pack\\".<br /><br />Excess weight is a complex issue, one that goes far beyond knowing the right things to eat and the right way to workout.

In this book he shares his passion for diving, love for the diving partner he created in his wife Audrey and the story of their life together.<br /><br />At the same time he seemed to try to justify the series of mistakes that led to his wife's death during a dive. There was the encouragement to go deeper and deeper, the lack of proper medical equipment on board, not checking the gear on board in a reliable fashion, not having enough divers posted etc.<br /><br />I felt like shaking Pipin who was responsible for the dive, when he says he regrets that things weren't done differently but thats the way it was always done. Take responsibility.<br /><br />I have no doubt that he is truly sorrowful, but his poor decision making skills were shocking.<br /><br />The book helps you understand the passion of the sport but it leaves a very bad feeling when you realize the accident did not have to occur.	2004-09-11

Amy Knapp's Family Organizer made life so much easier last year that naturally I picked up the 2005 version.<br /><br />The calender is spiral bound approximately 8\\" and 1/2\\" by 6 \\". The first page includes space for personal information, school and emergency numbers. There is a 2 page section with the months at glance.<br /><br />The bulk of the book includes day by day pages for each month to record notes and \\"to do's\\".  Next to each is an easy tear page where you can write menus and a grocery list. There is also a month at a glance right before each month's day to day pages. (This is different from the 2004 calender which had all of the months at a glance at the end of the book). The 2005 edition starts with July 2004 and ends in December 2005.<br /><br />The organizer also includes stickers to indicate events like birthdays, or no school days and there are a number of pages at the back to jot down phone numbers.<br /><br />This years calender is printed in a duller green than last year. (I preferred the crispness of last years green). It also would be great if it had tabs for the different months.<br /><br />Overall though, the book is fantastic. So simple but includes so much of what you need to stay organized without feeling overwhelmed with spaces for other things.<br /><br />I generally plan menus a week in advance noting the meals on the menu section of the planner. I then write in grocery items I will need, to prepare those meals on the grocery list on the opposite side. Tear it out, and off to the store with my list..saves me time and money as I don't buy what I don't need and I have my menu planned for the week, PLUS my family eats healthier meals as they are planned in advance (no trips for fast food because mom doesn't know what to make).<br /><br />I also like to write in my fitness goals in the notes pages at the back of the book. Each day,in the month at a glance section, I record my physical activity ie walked 3 miles, played tennis etc. Its great to look at each month and see what I have accomplished.<br /><br />The day by day section tracks my appointments and other activities.<br /><br />A super calender to keep you and your family organized!<br /><br />Lee Mellotts etc. Its great to look at each month and see what I have accomplished. <br /> <br />The day by day section tracks my appointments and other activities. <br /> <br />A super calender to keep you and your family organized! <br /> <br />Lee Mellott <br /> <br />	2004-08-19

I am the lucky mom of a lovely 14 year old daughter who has been training since kindergarten to embrace singing as a career. Aside from allowing her to do local talent shows, competitions and musicals I have not encouraged her to aim for celebrity. Not my goal to see her become a has been at a tender age as so many talented youth do as they enter the Hollywood wheel. BUT she has been pushing to parlay her youth, beauty, perfect TV size 0 body and ability into a career now! She will last she says and singing is what she will do. No ifs ands or buts.<br /><br /> Not being blessed with ANY connections ie Goldie Hawn for a mom or Hulk Hogan for a dad or Jessica Simpson for a sister..I figured I'd best figure out how to approach the Hollywood thing.<br /><br /> Hence my reading of &quot;The Importance of Being Famous&quot;. Basically this is Orth's indepth look at a number of celebrities she reported on for Vanity Fair. It includes protrayals of stars and folks who became celebrities due to circumstances that were beyond their control. Maureen profiles the Laci Peterson case, Tina Turner, Denise Rich, Woody Allen, Mohamed Fayed and more. What becomes so very, very clear is that fame is not about talent but is about SELF-PROMOTION. The ability to get yourself noticed and continually stay in the public eye.<br /><br /> This ability is ever present in the big names like Madonna, Michael Jackson, Elizabeth Taylor and others who are continually shocking us by redesigning their face, marrying again or in some other way becoming news worthy.<br /><br /> In a nutshell covered in the 372 pages I realized that Orth was saying that there is a fine line between infamy and fame - that today's news is over in a flash as tomorrow's news occurs and the next big story is lurching close by. So to succeed long-term you must fascinate.<br /><br /> So I summed it up for my daughter. &quot;When you are ready, if you still want to be a well-known singer you are going to have to continually surprise to stay on top.&quot;<br /><br /> &quot;Yes mom&quot; she said &quot;I am going to have to keep people interested by reinventing myself.&quot; Guess she doesn't need to read the book. Now if I only had a cousin or knew somebody who knew somebody who was in the music industry!o continually surprise to stay on top.&quot; <br />  <br /> &quot;Yes mom&quot; she said &quot;I am going to have to keep people interested by reinventing myself.&quot; Guess she doesn't need to read the book.

Yowsa! This is a well researched account of how the food manufacturers are luring Americans into obesity beginning with our children.<br /><br /> Companies use product placement, product endorsement, product sizing and other factors to lure us into purchasing items that are not always the best for our health. By starting with our children, these manufacturers can capture a market and make profits for life.<br /><br /> Take soft drinks for example. Through active promotion, soda companies have encouraged greater consumption. According to Brownell, soda consumption in the eleven through seventeen age group has doubled within the past 20 years. Stores like 7-Eleven have increased the large size of pop from 16 oz to a 64 oz Double Gulp. Celebrities are used to push pop and brand name bottles show up on popular television shows.A twenty ounce bottle of a typical soft drink has 15 teaspoons of sugar. Is it any wonder that soda is the number one cause of obesity in children?<br /><br /> Brownell walks you through shocking examples of how Disney and other characters that are plastered on boxes of usually processed food items capture the child's desire. How sports heros like Michael Jordan (McDonald's) and entertainers like Garth Brooks (Dr. Pepper) are used to sell foods many of which are not in the consumers best interest.<br /><br /> Different manufactureres are out there lobbying to get your dollars and they are not thinking of your expanding girth or health. The sugar industry, for example, encourages the addition of sugar to everything from peanut butter to cereal to condiments to increase their bottomline (Americans consume 152 pounds per person per year).<br /><br /> The idea of MORE FOOD equals value is also covered. Why buy 1 taco at 89cents when you can have two for only a few cents more. Again encouraging consumption. Yes you can upgrade from that minibon to a classic cinnabon for only 48cents. But that 48cents will buy you 370 extra un-needed calories!<br /><br /> Brownell shares in depth the temptation our schools are facing. Many schools are selling out to pizza and soda companies. These rich producers offer millions of dollars to the educational system in exchange for brand placement. The schools eager to supplement their meager resources are loathe to turn it down.<br /><br /> Brownell also gives information on what we can do to stem the tide of the unhealthy food that is being foisted on us. He gives a number of suggestions including incentives for purchasing healthy foods, taxes on non-nutritious food, greater access and lower prices on real food and much more.<br /><br /> Most of us recognize that we are being targeted by the food producers. But as you read through this 358 page book you will realize just how far reaching the problem is. An excellent read for parents who are having a hard time resisting the call of &quot;Blues Clues&quot; fruit treats and for the eater who wonders why they just sucked in a muffin that could easily feed 4.<br /><br /> Excellent information and resource!<br /><br /> Lee Mellottlories! <br />  <br /> Brownell shares in depth the temptation our schools are facing.

This little book has a lot of informative techniques on what you can do to win the weight battle. Instead of focusing on nutrition D'Agostino zeros in on your mind. How to use the mind to help you help yourself to the body you deserve.<br /><br /> The book includes ideas such as aversion therapy (ie imagining the food in a negative manner), rethinking your attitude after you have blown it, visualization etc.<br /><br /> The draw back is, as another reviewer pointed out the editing. If someone is going to write a book on &quot;loosing&quot; weight lets at least spell it correctly. Throughout the text the word &quot;loosing&quot; kept cropping up casting doubts on the authors expert ability to help anyone be effective at &quot;losing&quot; weight as she couldn't even spell the word! Santa &quot;Clause&quot; also makes an appearance. Hmmm didn't know Claus has changed the spelling of his last name. These errors and others really cast a big shadow over the book - distracting. I am not the world's greatest speller either, but if my book was up for publication I would certainly run a spell check on it.<br /><br /> The illustrations were also unattractive. Tiny pencil drawings of stick figures with pot bellies.<br /><br /> Though most of the ideas in the book are very good, you will have to look past the drawings and text errors, and that can be tough to do.	2004-08-03

Abused as a child, she grew up, it seems hating everything and everyone. In this book Janice gives advise to women on how to get and keep their man, shares celebrity stories, and talks about how she manages to stay looking good.<br />The cover of the book is creative with Janice set up to look like a Barbie doll but the content of the book is weak. Janice shares good information in the beginning of the book when she explains in depth how artificial the looks we see in magazines are. Though real women compare themselves to models in magazines, these images are false as the models have been computer enhanced and in true life are most likely staying slender in unhealthy ways. The book goes downhill from there.<br />She rips apart fellow models for their wrongdoings like Christie Brinkley who moved in with Janice's boyfriend soon after they broke up. But then in typical Janice double standard fashion she sees nothing wrong with sharing her bed with other men who are already taken.<br />Janice does her best to treat the reader like they are her best buds and baring her soul but her rough, abrasive personality,  and foul language permeate the book and its just not pretty. Her egotistical, &quot;I am so hot and beautiful&quot; nature is immature and becomes old quickly. Her photos reflect this too.<br />I really feel sorry for the worlds first self- professed &quot;supermodel&quot; a fact she reminds you of constantly throughout the book, and I feel sad that she bases her self worth on how many men desire her. Hopefully one day she will find true inner beauty and peace.<br />Meantime skip the book or borrow it.	2004-06-30

Don't be fooled by the title, \\"The Martini Diet\\" by Jennifer \\"Gin\\" Sander, is not a version of the drinking man's diet. Instead it's a truly delcious way to lose weight!<br /><br />The Martini Diet consists of 3 very simple rules: Rule #1 - Eat only the very best. Rule #2 - Eat somewhat less of the very best and Rule #3 - Eat the very best only at mealtimes (ie no snacking). According to Gin if you follow these rules the pounds will drop.<br /><br />Personally I have tried a number of methods to lose the baby weight I gained (and baby is 14) from questionable supplements to lo-fat foods to food combining to Weight Watchers. I would get very hyped on these plans only to discover that none of it worked LONG TERM. You see, I like my comforts and that includes chocolate, wine, good bread, etc. So I just couldn't stick to programs that didn't include these goodies or that encouraged eating fake foods that made my appetite increase!<br /><br />Gin's book teaches balancing pleasure with moderation. If you give up the fake, tacky foods like processed cheese whiz, and diet nutrition bars and lo-fat fake cookies etc. and if you eat real food in modest portions and don't snack much if at all, you can lose weight. And you will LOVE the process.<br /><br />My dinner last night was a simple piece of grilled chicken, corn on the cob (no, you dont have to give up starches..just eat them in modest portions) and asparagus. Washed down with a glass of zin and chased by a piece of rich dark chocolate. What could be better?<br /><br />I love Gin's book because of the refreshing way she writes. She entreats you to become a food snob and turn your nose up at the twinkies and boxed scalloped potatoes. You are too good for that. I love the way Gin tells you to treasure yourself and indulge in the very best.<br /><br />However, there are a few things that bothered me about the book. The first is though Gin implores you to eat \\"REAL FOOD\\" she confesses she has a penchant for Slim-fast. Though Gin tells you to \\"LOVE YOUR FOOD\\" she then shares that she enjoys Slim-fast because, \\"it gets that morning meal out of the way\\". Huh? What happened to enjoying your food? She also includes recipes at the back of the book and a few include questionable ingredients like soda pop.<br /><br />Despite the few inconsistencies, I give the book top ratings because of the core message. Gin's message is to \\"Spoil Yourself Thin\\". This will help you get out of the weight loss means depriviation and punishment mode. She suggests you treat yourself to the best food. When you get a craving, pamper yourself by beautifying yourself instead of eating. You participate in exercise you love instead of killing yourself at workouts you hate.<br /><br />By now you may be wondering why the title, \\"The Martini Diet\\". This is because Gin suggests you indulge each day in a glass of wine or martini for the health benefits and pure enjoyment. She also gives simple techniques to figure out your portions sizes by using a martini glass. Nifty!<br /><br />Gin admits she is not a scientist or doctor. She is just sharing what works for her. So if you read around the inconsistencies and stick to the core of what she is sharing  you will have fun with the book. Gin wants you to enjoy your life and losing weight can be a pleasure if you follow her tips.Gin tells you to \\"LOVE YOUR FOOD\\" she then shares that she enjoys Slim-fast because, \\"it gets that morning meal out of the way\\".

When you are bought up on packaged mac and cheese, Wonderbread and Twinkies it's hard to know what good food really is.<br />But after you have experienced a balsamic vinaigrette salad with pine nuts and smoked chicken or a pan seared tuna glazed in fresh orange and basil you realize that there is a wealth of delicious food out there once you start looking past the boxes of Hamburger Helper and Lucky Charms.<br />That's where Ari Weinzweig author of Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating comes in. Ari doesn't care about fancy food. He cares about simple, good tasting food. And the best food begins with the freshest ingredients.<br />In this book Ari shares his wealth of knowledge about food. He teaches you how to select the best food items and how to really experience your food by learning how to taste.<br />Yes he teaches you how to taste. You will fine tune your palate.<br />But think about it, many of us gobble our food so quickly we don't taste it. So we eat more. We eat processed foods rats would turn away from. And some of us become fat and unhealthy.<br />In this book Ari educates us. You will learn how to select the best bread, cheese, olive oil, pasta, chocolate and more. Take chocolate for example.

He goes on to give the history of cocoa and describes how chocolate bars are made.  He also names specific brands to look for like Valrhona, Scharffen Berger and Michel Cluizel. He even details how to taste chocolate so you can truly assess the flavors. Yum.  Ari, I think I will try to figure that one out myself!<br />The book also includes a number of tasty recipes such pasta with pepper and percorino, mashed sweet potatoes with vanilla, dark chocolate granita and miguel's mother's macaroni.<br />Other tidbits in the book include brewing tea for the best cuppa, when to buy certain cheeses , spotting a good wine vinegar, and much more.<br />A fabulous read, one you will savor and learn from.<br />Lee Mellotta good wine vinegar, and much more.<br />A fabulous read, one you will savor and learn from.<br />Lee Mellott	2004-05-20

I hate to bash a book that the authors obviously spent alot of time writing. And Bretibart and Ebner have amassed a wealth of information here and present it in an easy to read style.<br />The problem I had is that nothing in it was new. I read alot but entertainment news is not at the top of my list. I read The Star and Enquirer in the check out line at the grocery store. Graze through People or Entertainment Weekly at the hairdressers or doctors. Watch the E channel on occasion. Yet I knew all the stories they shared in the book.<br />That Angelina Jolie had adopted and was estranged for her dad. That Polanski raped a teen and was still lauded by hollywood. Even that Mick Jagger slept with the gal from &quot;One Day At A Time&quot;. Nothing new here.<br />The authors offer their comments and its kinda interesting but since all the info is a repeat, it falls flat. And what is with the continual reference to Tom Cruise as the &quot;heterosexual Tom Cruise&quot;. Throughout the book the authors continue to refer to Tom as &quot;the heterosexual Tom Cruise&quot;. So what's the point?<br />Me thinks Breitbart and Ebner are good writers but need to spend time unearthing new information, not rehash old news.	2004-04-28

It describes the diet though not in the detail of the original book. It explains what you need to do to get your fridge and pantry 'southbeach' friendly. It explains what is allowed in terms of diary, meat, oils, pasta, snacks, beverages and more.<br />Next the book has a question/answer session with Dr. Agatston. In this section he updates some of the information from the original book (milk and yogurt are now allowed in phase 1 for example) and he gets into more detailed regarding different types of food.<br />Then comes the core of the book. The recipe categories include breakfasts, appetiziers and snacks, soups, salads, side dishes and accompaniments, fish shellfish and poultry, meats, vegetarian entrees and desserts. Each recipe indicates what phase it is appropriate for and many of the recipes are pictured in mouthwatering photographs!<br />Sample recipes include Vegetable Salad with Feta, Homestyle Green Bean Casserole, Pan Seared Pecan Grouper, Whole Wheat Vegetable Lasagna, and Apple and Almond Souffle. Over 200 recipes.<br />One very nice feature is the inclusion of recipes so you can make many of your own condiments. Unfortunately ketchup, barbeque sauce and many other &quot;toppers&quot; are laden with high fructose corn syrup. So Dr. Agatston includes the details on how you can make your own.<br />Overall the quality of recipes is very good. The one negative I have is the total avoidance of sugar and reliance on sugar substitutes. I would rather use real sugar in moderation than sugar substitutes like aspartame. He has a recipe for strawberries with velvety chocolate dip and suggests you use sugar free chocolate syrup. Instead why not use a high quality cocoa bar and melt it down. This is healthier than the faux sugars like malitol,which are in sugar free products and so much more satisfying.<br />Dr. Agatston has some wonderful recipes in this book from top chefs and restaurants and they are worth buying the book for. But many of the desserts with the fake sugars and fat free sour cream fall flat. Moderation is key. Use the real deal in a tiny quantity like the French do.ugar free products and so much more satisfying.<br />Dr. Agatston has some wonderful recipes in this book from top chefs and restaurants and they are worth buying the book for.

The author of &quot;Escape Your Shape&quot;, Edward Jackowski is back with a food focused plan to help you &quot;Escape Your Weight&quot;.<br />Essentially the book operates on the basic calories in, calories out premise.<br />The author first asks you to select the type of weight loss plan you can live with. Do you want to exercise as little as possible? Or would you rather alter your eating habits only slightly and exercise more? Once you have made your selection, you zero in on the amount of weight you want to lose.<br />If you want to lose 11-30 pounds and don't want to exercise much then you would be on the limited approach plan. This plan means you can eat 1400 calories to meet your goals.<br />Jackowski stresses a healthy, natural diet. Slow, steady weight loss. He does tell you how to kick your weight loss into high gear and lose more weight quicker BUT he also tells you that you may burn out that way and you are better off losing it slowly and permanently.<br />Jackowski also gives an exercise prescription for weight loss. These plans vary, but a typical day may include a warm-up, stretch, fat burner (like jumpe rope), upper body exercise, jumping jacks, hip work, abs and legs, etc.<br />I really appreciate Jackowski's honestly. He doesn't sugar coat the truth. If you want to get slim, you are going to have to work at it FOREVER. Not for a few weeks out of the year, FOREVER.<br />Jackowski gives eating plans for each calorie level and you are not to deviate from the plan. I like the fact that you can choose your meal choice and are given about 7 meal selections for breakfast, lunch and dinner to choose from BUT its a diet and with only 7 selections that could get limiting long term.<br />The other thing I disliked about the plan is the distribution of calories. Many folks are not hungry when they wake up and have trouble eating a lot of food. Jackowski's breakfast calories are substantial equal to those at lunch. I personally feel full in the am on just a few hundred calories, and would rather eat a small snack after dinner. But on the 1600 limited approach Jackowksi would have me stuff down 2 and 1/4 cup cereal, 1 cup skim milk, 1 cup berries, 12 almonds and 1 hard boiled egg for breakfast. Thats 500 calories! A lot more food than I want. My thought would be to perhaps eat some of what he suggests for breakfast and save some of it for an after dinner snack. In addition there are no vegetarian substitutions given.<br />Jackowski's plans allow for 3 meals and 1 mid-afternoon snack.<br />One thing that always inspires me with a diet book is the testimonials and Jackowski's got a bunch of them with pictures at the back of the book. But there was one MAJOR problem with the testimonials, they all followed the authors EXERCISE plan but few of them followed his EATING plan which is what &quot;Escape Your Weight&quot; is supposed to be about.<br />In the first testimonial the happy loser describes how she doesn't combine carbs with proteins. Then she talks about funky foods. What is Suzanne Sommers diet doing in Ed Jackowki's book?<br />I thought I would be reading testimonials for Ed's diet.<br />Well at least he is honest. Essentially Ed is telling us that to lose weight you have to EAT LESS, EXERCISE MORE. There is no magic pill or bullet. And you can do it with his method that is laid out for you or you can use another method so long as you are burning more than what you take in.<br />Ed also gives lots of tips throughout the 328 page book. Its well written and it includes a number of black and white photographs to illustrate the exercises and testimonials. There is also a section with advise on how to lose that last 10 pounds.<br />Bottomline I would recommend this book for anyone who needs some commonsense weight loss advise.

Sadly not one of them tells you about the diet, because if it did I would not have purchased the book.<br />&quot;The Calcium Key&quot; is a well researched (though the studies were sponsored by the dairy industry), well written book on how calcium when added to your diet can help you lose weight.<br />The authors obviously spent a lot of time writing the text which is very easy to understand and clarifys the calcium-weight loss connection.<br />Putting aside any self serving interests that perhaps the author benefited from the support of the dairy industry and the results were skewed, I decided to trust in the authors expertise and focus on the plan.<br />Sadly the plan is a labor intensive one that very few people will be willing and able to follow long term. It involves as the author puts it, writing down every thing you eat and using an exchange system.<br />The author lists calorie levels and how many exchanges you can eat for your level (similar to the old Weight Watcher progam).<br />For example if you are on 1200 calories (and the author teaches you how to determine your caloric level) you get 3 breads, 2 meats, 3 veggies, 3 fruits, 3 dairy and 3 fats.<br />3 graham cracker squares would equal 1 bread group. 1 cup milk would be a dairy. Sounds simple enough...but then you get into mixed foods like a butterfinger candy bar and you have 1 bread group, 2 fruit (dont ask) and 2 fats.<br />In order to keep it all straight you must keep a diary and write it all down.<br />Now that said, I think the author is on to something when he suggests adding dairy to your diet. The combination of protein and fat is much more satiating than say a slice of cake or a cookie.<br />But very few people want to micromanage their diets the way this book proposes.<br />So though it introduces the calcium weight loss connection, the actual diet is not one that many will succeed with. Just try adding calcium rich foods to your diet 3 times per day and don't increase calories.diet 3 times per day and don't increase calories.	2004-03-03

Frances Kuffel begins her book, &quot;Passing for Thin: Losing Half My Weight and Finding My Self&quot; with descriptions of food she has known and love. She describes her absolute passion for food. The heel of a leftover roast, cracker crumbs, cocktail fruit. She licks and slurps her way through the first few chapters in the book.<br />So its stunning to find that she is able conquer her addiction and lose half of her body weight. Frances joins a 12 step program and commits. This book reveals her journey to weight loss. How she thinks, what she feels in graphic detail. How she wears shorts under her dress because her thighs rub together. How her loose skin can be pulled up and shifted around.<br />The book is not a weight loss book. It gives only a brief glimpse of her weight loss program (3 meals a day no snacks, no sugar, no flour). Yet at the same time its very inspiring.<br />Though I have just a few pounds to lose, as I read the book I realized that if someone had to live by such strict rules to lose weight I sure couldn't complain about giving up desert now and then.<br />The book is beautifully written. Frances is a gifted author. It totally captures her feelings and the way she struggles with her weight. One of the best books I have read in years!	2004-02-28

Ever dived into a chocolate cake after a stressful day at the office? Had your way with a bag of chips after fighting with the kids? Stuffed down more than your share of greasy fried food when you were feeling low?<br />Many of us are stress overeaters. And there are a number of books on the market that mention how we have emotional roadblocks that keep us from becoming slim. But few of these books discuss this issue in the depth that &quot;Calm Energy&quot; does.<br />And few give helpful solutions.<br />The author Robert Thayer Ph.D describes in detail how when we are feeling tense, tired, or depressed we often turn to high fat sugary foods. Citing a number of studies Thayer explains why we do this.<br />Then Thayer explains simple solutions. According to Thayer, &quot;exercise is the single best way of coping with the tension and fatigue that inevitably result from stress.&quot; He describes simple techniques you can do when your urge to eat, what you don't need seems to overwhelm your body. A brisk 5 minute walk is one idea.<br />One paragraph in the book made a huge impact. Thayer recounts how a taxicab driver was very calm despite bad traffic, radio calls etc. The driver used worrybeads to release tension. According to Thayer small systemic movements like moving beads or squeezing soft rubbery objects can help relax your body.<br />I quickly hijacked my 14 year olds stringed bead bracelet and by manipulating the beads slowly released some stress and managed to avoid a trip to the kitchen to gobble up some goodies I didn't need! Simple, effective technique that I will use more often.<br />Overall an excellent look at the mood food connection with super tips on what you can do to destress and become healthier.	2004-02-19

One thing I love about Amazon is the opportunity to read reviews which helps me decide if I should purchase a book.<br />Thus it was great to see a number of reviews written on &quot;The Calcium Diet&quot;. But as I read the reviews I noticed that they all were written in the same time frame. They all were written by &quot;a reader&quot; and they all said pretty much the same thing and some included plugs for Ms. Kayes website.<br />Ms. Kaye's previous book &quot;The Skinny Pill&quot; (see my review) was  disappointing. So could her new book. &quot;The Calcium Diet&quot; deliver?<br />Recently studies have shown that calcium is a nutrient that can curb cravings and help your body burn fat. Another book at Amazon, &quot;The Calcium Key&quot; is written by the researcher behind many of these studies. The calcium weight loss connection is so interesting I did a quick web search to see what else I could find out. There was some disappointing news. Perhaps calcium is a key in weight loss BUT guess who sponsored many of these studies; The dairy industry and others who would benefit, according to what I read online.<br />I hope this did not effect the results of the studies. I am not saying calcium does not aid in weight loss only that the if the sponsor of the studies is the industry that sells dairy...well it makes me wonder.<br />In Edita's newest book she no longer looks at the skinny pill (chitosan and other supplements) as the miracle pill to blast fat as she did in her previous book. Now she claims calcium is key. In her book she recommends you take 1,200 mg calcium in 3 daily divided doses. As I mentioned previously many of the studies were sponsored by the dairy industry. But there is still  the possiblity that YES calcium does work to promote weight loss. However, in the original studies fat loss was found to be greater if you EAT DAIRY as opposed to INGESTING SUPPLEMENTS. Edita's plan involves taking supplements.<br />I do think calcium can help, in a weight loss program. If you ate a yogurt for a snack for example, the combination of protein and carbs would do more to help you control your appetite than if you ate cookies. So perhaps calcium can help you shrink in size. However, I would like to read more studies that do not have a vested interest in the results.<br />Then Edita goes on to suggest a diet to use with your new calcium supplementation plan. Let's see meat, fish, chicken, veggies. Sound familiar? Yes its the low carb high protein plan, with some twists. After week 1, Edita suggest you add spicy condiments to raise your metabolism and in week 3 you add diuretic fruits like tomato, parsley and lemon to make you lose your bloat by running to the restroom.<br />If you follow Edita's low carb plan you will lose weight. But will you be able to stick to it and keep it off? And be sure to check out who published the book.ogram.

The good fats and carbs will nourish your body, help you stay healthy and lose weight. Eating the wrong kinds will trigger cravings, decrease your ability to burn off calories and make you hungry.<br />In this book, Dr. Agatston shows you at a glance which fats and carbs are compatable with \\"The South Beach Diet\\". Each entry lists a food item, its carbohyrate, sugar and fat grams. Foods are then ranked as limited, very limited or avoid. There are over 1,200 listings.<br />The beginning of the book gives a quick overview of \\"The South Beach Diet\\". It describes why we need to select certain foods in order to lose weight and get healthy. Though it does not go into the great detail of the original South Beach Diet book, you could purchase this mini book and learn enough to be able to follow the diet successfully.<br />The book packs in a lot of information. In addition to the overview, and food ratings there are also shopping tips and meal makeovers. A handy dining out section makes it easier to stay on the South Beach track at your favorite restaurants.<br />A quick guide also lists what foods to enjoy on each phase of the diet.<br />The only drawback to the book is though its smaller than a normal sized book (7\\" tall by 5\\" wide), it's still to large to fit in a pocketbook. It would be nice if it were smaller, making it more portable, thus I deducted one star.<br />Other than that, the book is a super handy resource, excellent for those following the South Beach diet or concerned about their health.	2003-12-21

You can almost taste the buttery brie and smell the crisp baguettes baking in chef James Hallers book, &quot;Vie de France&quot;.<br />Haller and a group of friends rented a lovely home in Savonnieres a small town in the Loire Valley for a month. The beauty of the area, availability of fine fresh food and warmth of good companions inspired Haller to share the time he spent in the region.<br />In &quot;Vie De France&quot;, Haller describes how he and his friends enjoyed their days, looking for antiques, exploring the marketplace and soaking up the atmosphere.<br />Haller is an award winning chef and author of several cookbooks.

He describes dishes he made using fresh, local ingredients and dishes he enjoyed at casual cafes and fancy restaurants.<br />Haller walks you through the marketplace where he selects from four aisles of cheeses. You will pick from the freshest vegetables displayed like jewels. The butcher cuts your meat to order as you wait. In the patisserie the variety of breads, candies and pastries delight the eye. It's hard to decide between a &quot;crusty round pain de compagnes&quot; or a hearty wheat bread.<br />Back in the kitchen, Haller prepares tasty dishes using natural, healthy ingredients like creamy French butter, olive oil, herbes de Provence and garlic. The delicious recipes he makes are interspersed throughout the book. Recipes included range from the simple - french toast baguette with an apricot sauce to the more complex - turkey cutlets stuffed with a mushroom pilaf in a white wine and sorrel cream sauce. Other recipes included range from the common - grilled meat and a nice green salad to the more unusual - baked snails in butter, lemon and parsley.<br />The dining experience usually includes a fine red wine and a dessert. Desserts range from light to rich. A decadent creme caramel ends a simple soup and salad meal. Chocolate with hazelnuts tops a meal of sausage and red wine ragout. An apricot lavender tart completes a roast chicken stuffed with cassoulet. A table of menus at the beginning of the book makes finding the recipes easy.<br />In &quot;Vie De France&quot; Haller will create his moroccan olive salad or fresh tomatoes in basil dressing for your enjoyment.

Books	4	11	12	N	Y	Timeless tale to teach Elegance!	Genevive Dariaux wrote this book in the early 60's. It is an alphabetical listing from A - Z describing how one can become an elegant individual. With her classic French style Ms. Dariaux describes many aspects of life and how to handle them in an elegant manner. Topics range from children to pocketbooks to zippers.<br />Despite having written this over 20 years ago, much of it remains true and useful today.<br />The book was a hidden gem till Kathleen Tessaro based her fiction novel Elegance on it. Then the price shot up from approximately $20 to the upper $200's with one daring booksite offering it for an astonishing $1,599! No takers I hope for the book is going to be reprinted in November of 2003. In her fiction book Tessaro quotes Dariaux's non-fiction book.<br />It should be noted that Tessaro with the permission of Ms. Dariaux did change some of what she quoted and updated it in the way she felt Dariaux would have written it, if she had written it today.<br />Elegance by Dariaux is a timeless read and its hard to find that type of information and instruction on how to be (become)elegant in the books of today.<br />Another excellent book on Elegance that is much harder to find  is A GUIDE TO ELEGANCE by Jacqueline DuPasquier. Written in the 50's, A Guide to Elegance is also a gem if you are lucky enough to find it.	2003-09-22

It lists products, brand names, ingredients, how sold, background and research, product claims, side effects, precautions and other information.<br />A number of products are covered. Everything from A Aoqili Slim Soap (yes a soap that claims it makes you skinny as you wash with it), to Z zhi shi (citrus rinds of the bitter orange). And lots in between. Here you can learn the truth about slim fast , bee pollen, locust root, ginger, 5HTP and more. The good (green tea) the bad (fat trapper) and the ugly (ephedra) are all covered.<br />A handy index at the back of the book makes it easy to look up the pill you were thinking of popping. One drawback is the book does not cover starch blockers. Since the book was published in 2002 starch blockers which are becoming more popular should have been included. Hence the 4 instead of 5 star rating.<br />Overall a great little reference!	2003-09-16

With a doctorate in education and her own college consulting business she boasts that she has close to 100% success rate at getting her clients admitted to top colleges.<br />Sadly most of us can't afford a top notch counselor like Dr. Hernadez and often find ourselves floundering in piles of college applications overwhelmed by the daunting task of filling them out.<br />Fortunately, Dr. Hernadez has written \\"Aciing the College Application\\" to help you present yourself in the best light possible. Learn how to highlight skills, talents and passions in just a few pages.<br />And the book offers excellent information. It includes an indepth look at the common application. The truth about essays. How to ask guidance counselors and teachers for recommendations.<br />Which academic subjects, activities and work experience to mention and more.<br />Sadly the more college preparation books I read the more disagreements I have found. For example,<br />one issue she discusses is if you should type or handwrite the application. She suggests handwriting as it looks more like the student themselves completed it. Another book I read said that you should type it because studies have shown that papers that were typed were given better grades than handwritten papers. Thus good typing could make the difference between being admitted and being rejected.<br />She also suggests using blue ink. I was surprised by this as I have always been told black ink was the most professional. On a whim, I called an admissions office and asked (feeling rather anal) which color ink they would like the application written in. The woman who answered said definately black as it was the most professional.<br />The book also lacks an index. Thus looking for particular information can be time consuming.<br />Overall its a helpful book and a little fine tuning could make it one of the best.	2003-09-16

It measures 8 and 1/2 inches high by 6 and 1/2 inches wide. The first page has a space for personal information, emergency and school phone numbers.<br />Another page shows the months of 2004 on one page.<br />The book opens to display two pages. On the left page is a space to write in groceries. And a large TO DO list. On the right page is one week of the month beginning with Monday with a space to write in notes. Next to the days of the week are a few lines to write in your menu choice for the day.  Both the menu and grocery list areas are perforated so you can pull them out and take them to the store with you.<br />The back of the book features a full month at a glance calender with space to write in activities and projects.  A planning calender, several pages for notes, babysitter information and a space for addresses.<br />I have found that planning simple meals a week in advance is one of the best ways I can save money (by not going out to dinner) and feed my family a healthy meal. In the past I used a separate notebook to write down a weeks worth of easy meals and another sheet to record the groceries I need to buy. With this planner, organizing will be a snap. (I also highly recommend &quot;Fix It and Forget It Feasting From Your Crockpot&quot; to further simplify meals.)<br />Making a TO DO List is anther way I can accomplish my goals. This book will remind me to do that daily and there is plenty of space to write notes.<br />Amy Knapp's Family Organizer is a winning tool to help make life simpler!	2003-08-22

There you would find the Liz blouse and skirt I wore to celebrate my nephew's birth 20 years ago. A tiny DKNY white jumper and see through mesh top that is cute but maybe a wee bit young for me now. A wonderful, classic pair of Ann Taylor navy blue pants with tags attached. (I never did lose the 5 pounds needed to get into them). Too many other clothing items that are a bit snug here or there and too uncomfortable to wear. A soft white snap up sweater that looks cozy but on closer inspection reminds me of the onesie outfits my children once wore. A red vest that is boring. A sweater with little balls decorating it that is last years news. You get the idea.<br />Yet it is hard to part with these things. You never know when the weight will drop off. The big shoulder pad look will come back in style. A fuzzy sweater will come in handy to lend to your mom when she vists. The red vest will cheer the residents of the nursing home up when you go there. The Smithsonian will want to display the first suit you ever wore.<br />And despite having all these goodies in your wardrobe, its hard to find anything to wear! That was my dilemma till I lucked into finding the book, &quot;I Don't Have A Thing To Wear&quot;.<br />The book begins by having you describe your &quot;circle of life&quot;. What activities do you do each day. I realized for example I had a dozen or so gorgeous beaded dresses hanging in my closet, but I hadn't gone to a very formal occasion in years.<br />Yet for lunching out with friends which I do fairly frequently I didn't have many pairs of nice slacks and usually resorted to dressing up my jeans.<br />Once you figure out what you do.

Most of the beaded dresses set for the consignment shop, other garments for the women's shelter, some to charity, others earmarked for auction.<br />They also recommend hanging slacks on clipped hangers not folded.

Cindy Jackson has been described as the woman who is trying to make herself look like a Barbie doll. But if you read her book she is not trying to look like Barbie, she is trying to look her absolute best using information she found as an art student that gives the proportions for a perfect face.<br />Cindy was born to a mother and father who focused more on their interests than on Cindy's. It wasn't that she was not loved. It was that her parents did not know how to parent well. At 6 Cindy's dad handed over the wheel to an airplane while they were in the sky and told her to fly the plane. This was his idea of helping Cindy learn to be capable and competent.<br />Cindy wanted to enjoy the fussiness of being a girly girl by dressing pretty, playing with dolls and making herself look cute. But her parents wouldn't spend much money on Cindy. As a result she wore hand me downs, had few toys and never felt pretty.<br />One day she found a Barbie doll at a local discount store. After several days of tears her father broke down and bought it for her. This doll triggered deep emotions in Cindy who imagined what the life of the doll would be like if she were real.<br />As Cindy grew older, she felt she did not get things she should because she felt she was not attractive. And she embarked on a series of operations to perfect her face.<br />The first operation corrected the bags under her eyes. I personally thought Cindy looked great after this procedure and needed no further refinement. Cindy however, is on a mission to be as perfect as possible. This book describes her childhood and each of the surgeries she has had to look like her vision of the ideal woman.<br />Surgeries include having her skin lifted and completely redraped on her face in order to smooth wrinkles, permanent makeup, lip surgery, cheek implants, her chin cut down and more.<br />Cindy does look lovely in the after pictures however, I read once that you can tell if someone has had their lips injected because the upper lip is larger than the lower and this is not normal. Cindy does have a much fuller upper lip. She is probably in search of that fuller lower lip now.<br />The book gives a few insights as to what to look for in a plastic surgeon. Mainly though its focus is on Cindy and why she chose to do what she did. A number of graphic photographs of Cindy in the stages of some of her operations are included. Living Doll is an interesting look at total physical transformation.ause the upper lip is larger than the lower and this is not normal. Cindy does have a much fuller upper lip.

Over the years I have read a number of diet books. One expert after another sharing a different diet, none of which worked for me.  Food combining, low carb, no-fat, over exercising, dubious supplements and other weight loss methods resulted in my needing to lose 40 pounds instead of the 20 I wanted to lose when I started.<br />Then I came across Julia Havey's book. Julia is not a scientist, doctor, or nutritionist. Julia is a woman who weighed 290 pounds, wore a size 24 and hit rock bottom when she discovered her spouse was unfaithful. Determined to change her attitude and her life, she lost over 130 pounds, found new love and was crowned Mrs. Missouri!<br />She shares how she accomplished her weight loss in her book &quot;Awaken The Diet Within&quot; and she teaches how you can reach your weight loss goals too. Julia has been there. She understands the pain and frustration of being overweight. The despair at failing at yet another diet. And she knows that dieting does not work. Lifestyle and mental changes work. This is the key to &quot;Awaken The Diet Within&quot;.<br />Simple steps equal big results. Julie teaches you step by step what to do to get the body you want. There is no  complicated diet, strenuous workout or special pill you have to take. You don't need a PhD to understand the book. It's very clear and concise.<br />Reading the book is like chatting with your best girlfriend. Your friend has lost a ton of weight. She looks fantastic! And now she is going to tell you in simple terms how you can lose the weight you want too and she is going to root for you every step of the way!<br />First you develop the right attitude. Mini questions will help you really dig deep into why you want to lose weight and what you can accomplish with your weight loss. Then Julia holds your hand and walks you step by step to achieve your goal. One step builds upon another. These are baby steps. You do not go to step 2 until you have accomplished the first one. It's very doable.<br />Steps include drinking tons of water, exercising, eating lots of fruits and vegies etc. Of course you know that these are important to weight loss. But in the past you may not have been able to consistently include them in your life. Julia teaches you how. She teaches you how to work the food pyramid so it helps you stay healthy and fit.<br />I cannot emphasize enough how inspiring Julia is. She tells you what you need to do in a way that makes you want to do it! Her words are powerful and she speaks from her soul. Her honesty and caring shine through the book. You will be motivated!<br />As you work through the program steps, Julia includes advise on staying the course, building confidence and so much more. At the back of the book is a handy shopping list and a number of recipes including her famous veggie sandwich, healthy oatmeal cookies, mushroom salad, linguine with asparagus, pineapple pork chops and more. The recipes I tried were not only delicious, but simple to prepare with easy to find ingredients.<br />I really love this book! Julia makes the weight loss process so clear and simple. At last!

When Loretta Laroche was a little girl her mom bought her sturdy but ugly underwear. She owned one pair of pretty panties but she was only allowed to wear them on special occasions. Thus they were only worn twice. Since that time Loretta has been scrambling to enjoy the good life NOW not save the good life for LATER.<br />And this book is all about enjoying your life in the present moment. Loretta cautions you to not save your fine china for a rainy day use it now. Don't put off what you want to do, do it now.<br />Enjoy what gives you pleasure and make the most of your time here on earth. The book is written in an easy to read style. Quick and light. Each chapter sharing another nugget of Loretta's joy of life.<br />The one thing I did not like about the book was Loretta's continual references to her weight problem. This was mentioned several times throughout the book. It seems that if Loretta followed her own advice of moderation in everything, and if she set it as a goal she really wanted to achieve she should be able to solve her weight issue. Loretta - practise what you preach!<br />Aside from that the author shares a lot of lively insights that make you realize how much pleasure you will have if you focus and enjoy the present instead of thinking about the future.	2003-08-08

As many people know, losing weight is often times easier than keeping it off. Atkins addresses this issue in his latest book, &quot;Atkins For Life&quot;.<br />The book &quot;Atkins for Life&quot; is an excellent resource book. It is filled with practical advice and tips on how to make your low carbohydrate weight loss a permanent success.<br />Over the years Atkins name has been maligned and sneered at as he pioneered the idea that its not the fat in our diet that makes us fat its the excessive amounts of carbohydrates we have been consuming. The low fat diet was presented to Americans as the best way and the healthiest way to lose weight. However, recent research has revealed the low fat diet to be a miserable failure. As the fat has been taken out of the diet carbohydrates have been added in their place and many Americans have become obese and unhealthy. Dr. Atkin's proposal that eating less carbs can lead to weight loss and better health has been vindicated.<br />The Atkins weight loss method is a 4 step approach. Phase 1 INDUCTION is where you limit your carbs to 20 grams per day to jump start your weight loss program. Phase 2 OWL or ONGOING WEIGHT LOSS allows you to slowly add back carbs until you discover the amount of carbs you can eat and still lose weight.<br />Phase 3 PRE-MAINTENANCE has you slow your weight loss by adding in more carbs so good eating habits become ingrained. And in Phase 4 LIFETIME MAINTENANCE you learn to enjoy a wider variety of foods and maintain your weight loss. This book &quot;Atkins for Life&quot; discusses each of the phases but is mainly concerned with Phase 4 LIFETIME MAINTENANCE.<br />You can learn what to do to lose weight with this book, but for in depth information, you would be better off selecting &quot;Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution&quot;.<br />This book covers in great detail how to maintain the weight you have lost. Part One: A Lifetime Plan recaps the Atkins program. It includes information on the diet, the effect on your body, putting it into practice and how to benefit from exercise. Part Two: Eating for Life teaches you how to get your kitchen in order, and gives thirty meal plans with carb counts. It includes twenty meal plans for special occasions. 125 recipes for success are also given.<br />YES you can eat carbohydrates. You can have bread, cake and pizza or even wine. The key of course is knowing how many carbohydrates your body can handle each day without gaining weight. And using techniques to get the most bang from your carbohydrate buck. These techniques are taught in the book. For example if you crave bread Atkins has several pages of information to help you make the best selection. Breads are ranked on their ability to effect your insulin levels. There are also tips on how to enjoy bread without overdoing it such as eating the crust only. Atkins shares techniques like this for a variety of foods.<br />Comfort foods are a big issue for many. Atkins tells you what to choose or what to substitute. Eating out is another area covered. Best choices at different restaurants is given in detail. Atkins also includes mental tips to help you avoid backsliding.<br />Key to the book is the detailed menu plans given for 4 ranges of carb levels at 45g, 60g, 80g and 100g . Just adjust up or down so you are at your level (which you learn from his diet). Meal plans are simple and include snacks. A sample day for a 60 g plan would include 1 slice lemon zucchini bread, with an egg and ricotta cheese for breakfast. Meat loaf with whole-grain bread and salad for lunch.<br />Jerk shrimp with pasta or collard greens for dinner and 1/2 cup of cantaloupe for a snack. Carb counts are given so you can substitute as desired.<br />Crab Deviled Eggs, Cherry Muffins, Mixed Berry Shortcakes, Pinwheel Cookies, Roasted Chicken and Feta Cheese Wrap, Chocolate Souffle and Southwestern Style Pork Fajitas are among the 125 recipes. Recipes include nutritional information, but are not pictured.<br />The370 page book also includes self tests and quizzes to help you stay on task. My favorite part of &quot;Atkins For Life&quot; has to be the success stories. There are a number of remarkable stories in the book with black and white photos included! Very inspiring!<br />The book &quot;Atkins For Life&quot; makes living a low carb life in our high carb world easier and enjoyable!

A few years ago, while vacationing in the Bahama's I observed a table of two French women eating lunch. They were both very slim, tres chic, and obviously not counting calories. Each woman had a full glass of red wine, some rich looking cheeses, a few crackers and a small assortment of other goodies. I couldn't help but wonder HOW they managed to remain so slim eating THAT. I was righteously nibbling on 1/2 bagel with a tad of fat (cream cheese) and some turkey protein thrown in. Yet I had at least ten pounds (ok 20)to lose. As a child I had lived in France and can still remember the delicious croissants, mouth watering chocolates, hearty breads, and rich cheeses the French ate so frequently. How did the women stay so slim? I had also noticed that the majority of them managed to look like a million dollars though I knew many of them were on tiny budgets. How did they do it? Then I came across Anne Barone's book at Amazon! Mais Oui! What a pleasure! I savored every morsel of Anne's delicious book, \\"Chic & Slim Encore\\". In the book Anne truly reveals how so many French women come across as attractive, chic, slim, in control, and poised regardless of the physical features nature gave them. She explains how you can eat rich, fatty, (forbidden) foods and remain tiny and terrific! What to look for in clothing so you always dress rich regardless of your pocketbook. How our feminity can be enhanced and appreciated if we so desire. The book embraces many aspects of the French culture and teaches aspects of the French lifestyle that we can use to enhance our lives. You learn how to simplify your life by aiming for quality not quantity. Moderation not accumulation. Buying the best you can afford in small amounts and forgetting the rest. Simple steps you can integrate into an active lifestyle to increase delight in the everyday! The book is a wonderful resource for enjoying and living the good life! Merci Anne!	2003-08-05

US	52362855	R2DWC265GYWMS8	0060548231	243613794	The Starch Blocker Diet	Books	4	65	69	N	N	Can you neutralize the calories in the foods you love ?	...The book describes a progrom that explains how you can eat carbohydrates like rice, pasta, bread and potatoes and lose weight. You lose the weight by taking a starchblocker. This calorie neutralizing substance called Phase 2 binds with the enzymes that digest starch. So when you take it with your meals most starch passes through your system without releasing calories. Phase 2 is made from white kidney beans and is very safe with no side effects aside from minor bloating or gas for some people.<br />The authors outline a 3 step program. You redistribute your calories so you eat more starchy foods so you will neutralize some of those calories. You learn to take emotional control of your eating and you burn body fat by exercising.<br />The authors state that by taking the correct dose of the product Phase 2. you will negate about 50%-75% of the starch calories in a carbohydrate meal. If you eat carbohydrate rich meals and take the supplement several times per day you will negate those calories thus be eating less calories and lose weight... In one study, patients lost an average of 3.9% of total body weight or an average of 6.45 pounds over 30 days compared to those on a placebo who lost 3 quarters of a pound. Another study shows a weight loss of .5 to 1 pound per week using the starch blockers...The biggest qualm I had with the book is it is not consistent with other informations as to when to take the starch blockers. The book says right before a meal. At the website of the starch blocker the authors sell it says take 30 minutes before (yes the authors sell starch blockers). So exactly when to take it is unclear. And very important for someone to know to have success with the plan.<br />After checking with representatives from several different brands and getting a number of different answers I learned that in the study the supplement was taken 30 minutes before.<br />The authors also make a few errors in the text. They refer to  40% protein 30% fat 30% carbohydrate  being a typical low carb diet..when the actual ratios are 40% carb, 30% protein and 30% fat.  On p. 69 they refer to gymnema sylvestre as a sugar blocker that is not readily available. Gymnema Sylvestre is marketed not as a sugar blocker but as a way to make it so your taste buds don't taste the sweet so you don't enjoy it. It's still available at health food stores. They suggest you supplement with chromium but do not specify chromium picolinate or chromium polynicotinate. They also tell you not to take more that 6 capsules a day of starch blockers. Yet in examples given they neutralize the calories from 3 meals and 2 snacks each day. Starch blockers have to be taken near the meal to work. So this would have you taking more than 6 starch blockers per day. The authors also suggest you switch your calories to more starchy ones so you can then block them. But this does not teach healthy eating habits. Perhaps it is better to try to control your intake of the energy dense starcy carbs like potatoes and bread and use the blockers as an additional helpmate.<br />The authors email addresses are given at the back of the book and I emailed both of them. But unfortunately, neither returned my emails to answer my questions. Finally I emailed customer service where the Dr. Rosenblatt the author sells his product (starchstoppers are sold under a variety of brand names) and a super representative named Susan answered my questions.<br />Skepticism aside there are a lot of good points in the book.  The authors discuss how for many folks starch blockers are very helpful in combating the intolerance to carbohydrates. Many folks bloat up when they eat carbs in reasonable amounts and the authors explain how the blockers can help with this.<br />The book details how to determine your calorie level based on your size and activity. It lists a lot of foods and their starch content so you can plan your own meals. It also rates foods based on how effective they would be on the starch blocker plan. \\"If a food contains a high amount of starch it is given a better grade\\" I did not find this list that useful. For example eggs are given a B but they dont have starch so I think the list is based more on what is healthy for you than the starch content of the item.<br />The book also includes a number of recipes from a French Chef including, hot crab sandwhich, chocolate hazelnut shortcake, chicken paprika, and a number of other tasty meals.<br />I often bloat when I eat small amounts of carbs and my stomach looks it. So I decided to try the starch blocker program. After just a few days on the program I felt less bloated (my imagination perhaps?) but have not lost any weight. However, it does take time. This is not a magic pill, its a helper. Thus it will be a while before I can clearly attest to the book or starchstoppers effectiveness. When I know for sure I will update this review. Meantime I have my fingers crossed and my starchblocker on hand!<br />UPDATE - I personally did not notice any difference after taking the starch blockers except less money in my purse. I feel the best course of action to lose weight is exercise and eating real food in small quantities.

But I was attracted to the this book when I saw it in the book store because of its title, &quot;Elegance&quot;. I own an older non-fiction book by Genevieve Dariaux also called, &quot;Elegance&quot;.  So I decided to see what the book was about.<br />To my surprise much of the book is based on the non-fiction book by Dariaux.<br />The main character in the book finds a dusty copy of &quot;Elegance&quot; in the used book store. Using the books advice she slowly transforms herself from an unhappy housewife with a dull job and a packed closet but nothing to wear into a woman of style and substance.<br />Each chapter begins with quotes from the Dariaux book (most of which are in the original book, a few have been made up by the author or changed.) And as each chapter goes along our heroine learns something that relates to the quote about style or elegance. For example, weight, men, restaurants, underwear are among the topics covered.

But I was attracted to the this book when I saw it in the book store because of its title, &quot;Elegance&quot;. I own an older non-fiction book by Genevieve Dariaux also called, &quot;Elegance&quot;.  So I decided to see what the book was about.<br />To my surprise much of the book is based on the non-fiction book by Dariaux.<br />The main character in the book finds a dusty copy of &quot;Elegance&quot; in the used book store. Using the books advice she slowly transforms herself from an unhappy housewife with a dull job and a packed closet but nothing to wear into a woman of style and substance.<br />Each chapter begins with quotes from the Dariaux book (most of which are in the original book, a few have been made up by the author or changed.) And as each chapter goes along our heroine learns something that relates to the quote about style or elegance. For example, weight, men, restaurants, underwear are among the topics covered. I especially enjoyed the chapter on lingerie. As I thought of my own worn DKNY nighties, our heroine Louise is learning that &quot;everything you own should do its job with some semblance of grace and dignity.&quot; and that we tend to dress and look better for complete strangers than our loved ones.

The result has been total confusion, as I muddled through conflicting information. Count your points, eat low fat, boost your metabolism with supplements, eat all you want but eat low carb, etc. Hundreds of different books all with a different opinion on how to lose weight.<br /><br />When a friend told me about Dr. Ellis's book, &quot;Dr. Ellis's Ultimate Diet Secrets Lite&quot;, I figured it was just another diet scheme dreamed up by the author to make himself rich and would probably make me fatter. I had dieted myself up the scale, trying out different plans. Gained 20 pounds eating all the fats and protein on one actresse's well known diet plan. Lost but quickly regained weight watching points on another plan. You name it, I tried it and ended up regaining weight and getting fatter.<br /><br />But the desire to lose weight was strong so I decided to read Dr. Ellis's book. I purchased the LITE version. The depth of Dr. Ellis's knowledge is so impressive, I later anted up for the BIG version of his book. But this review will focus on his LITE version.<br /><br />The book really begins with the cover. Dr. Ellis is pictured on the cover and his physique is spectacular. It's obvious he practise what he preaches. Over the years Ellis has experimented with his own body and in labs and explains clearly in this book exactly what adjustments you must make to lose weight and keep it off permanently. He has a PhD in Physiology and is an expert in bodyweight regulation.<br /><br />Ellis exposes the myths surrounding weight loss, that have caused failure and frustrations for hundreds of thousands of people. And he spells out exactly what one must do to get rid of unwanted pounds forever.<br /><br />No dieting Ellis believes in simple changes that will give you permanent results. The first key is that calories DO count. The sellers of the low carb books would like you to believe that there is a metabolic advantage to their program. Ellis dispells this myth and explains exactly how and why calories are the bottomline.<br /><br />Ellis does not stress dieting. His program involves making wise choices to lose weight. Eat a little less and burn more activity calories and you will achieve your desired goal.<br /><br />Ellis describes exactly how to do that in the book. And for all those looking for the magic fix explains why it isnt out there!<br /><br />Though this is the LITE version of the Big book it is jam packed with information. Chapters include physical activity, behavoir modification, the plan to lose weight, why low fat diets don't work, ketosis, the scoop on low carbohydrate diets and much more!<br /><br />Despite the science in the book, Ellis manages to explain everything clearly. And your interest and excitement in the book will grow page after page as you realize how you have been duped in the past and have finally found the answer to your weight loss woes.<br /><br />Once you have read the book you will know exactly what to do to lose weight and keep it off permanently!llis dispells this myth and explains exactly how and why calories are the bottomline.<BR> <BR>Ellis does not stress dieting.

Folks who love the original book, Formula 101 by the Daoust's will most likely be very disappointed in this companion book.<br />The main reason is that almost everything in it is a repeat of the &quot;Formula 101&quot; book. And new information given is what almost everyone already knows.<br />The most annoying part of the book is the verbatim repeat of information. For example the meal plan selection chart (this describes what meal planner to use based on your weight and activity level) is listed in the book about 5 times. Recipes in the book are repeats of recipes in the &quot;Formula 101&quot; book. Most of the tips and ideas in the book are already in the &quot;Formula 101&quot; book.<br />There are a few added tips. 100 tips are given altogether. But the added tips are common knowledge. Tips such as visualize yourself at your goal, park your car far from the store so you can get more exercise, drink lots of water etc. Nothing new here.<br />What I would like to have seen was photographs and testimonials from folks who succeeded with the &quot;Formula 101&quot;. New recipes.<br />More dining out ideas. In general new information. Sadly none of that is in the book.<br />The large margins, big type and lack of information makes this book not worth the $.

If you are looking for a historical, insiders perspective on the Mideast you will enjoy this book.<br />If you are interested in an insiders view of Queen Noor's life you will be disappointed.<br />From the photographs in the book, you can see the love between the Queen and her husband. But when you read the pages, very little detail is shared.<br />They meet. She expresses surprise that the King is interested in her. They date. They get married. Very little of their interpersonal relationship and courtship is described. She expresses her love for the King, but does not really describe their relationship.<br />As the book is titled &quot;Memoirs of an Unexpected Life&quot; , I really expected to read about the Queen herself. I would like to know how she felt about people she met, her wardrobe, how she stays fit, what she likes, etc. But none of this is in the book or if its mentioned its glossed over. Instead we have fleeting impressions of her country.<br />In one so tiny paragraph she describes how she recognized that her minimal wardrobe would not be sufficient when she married the King. I want to read more about her wardrobe, her daily routine, her thoughts on how she fits in the country. Yes I want some history but some fluff too. After all this is supposed to be a book about her.<br />Sadly none of this is revealed and what is written could have been written by anyone with a slight knowledge of the Queen.	2003-06-06

The Protein Power Lifeplan Gram Conter is designed to be a companion to the Protein Power Lifeplan book by the Eades. However, it can be useful with any low carb diet.<br />The book does not go into detail on the Eades diet, for that you would want to refer to one of their other books. This book is a simple resource, designed to make you aware of the carbohydrate, protein and fat counts in different food items.<br />Pull out this book and at your fingertips you have the counts of a variety of foods. The book has a numerous listings including Breads, Cereals and Grains; Dairy Products; Fish, Seafood and Shellfish; and more.<br />When carb count is given the ECC is used. The ECC or effective carb count is found by deducting the fiber from the total carbohydrate of a food item. Most nutrition books list the fiber and carb count separately. But for carb counters, the ECC is all you need to count. So this booklet saves you from doing the math. Very handy!<br />There are two drawbacks to the booklet. One is the size. Though it is smaller than a standard paperback, it's still larger, 6.75 x 4.05 than other pocketsized gram counters. This makes it bulkier to tote.<br />The major drawback though is the manner in which the Eades decided to list counts. For protein foods they do not list the carbohydrates. The Eades feel that since these foods are primarily protein, the carb count is too small to be concerned with. But this is not true. For many folks on a carbohydrate restricted diet, all carbs count.<br />If you are limited to say 20 grams of carbs per day, you will want to count the carbs in the eggs, seafood and other carbohydrate containing protein foods that you eat. It adds up. And if you go over, you may not achieve the health goals you are after.<br />Yes, the Eades book is handy to have for a quick reference, but my preference is for the Atkins gram counter which is smaller in size and lists net carb counts for all the foods, including protein.	2003-02-15

This is the story of the musical genius Jackie Du Pre as told by her sister Hilary and brother Piers.<br />Young Jackie was enthralled by the sounds of a cello at the tender age of 4. At 5 under her mothers tutelage she began lessons. Shortly thereafter, her gift was realized. She played not technically perfect but with an overwhelming passion and depth that stunned the music world.<br />Her sister an accomplished musician in her own right was pushed to the side as the accolades went to Jackie.<br />Piers became a pilot and later a businessman to escape a muscial competition he knew he could not match.<br />Throughout the book the love for family comes through. The mother's joy in music and her care in sharing and teaching her skills to her family flows throughout the book.<br />Jackies development as a musician is swift and her sister Hilary realizes that despite her own talents Jackie has a gift that can't be matched.<br />As an individual who cannot play an instrument, it is fascinating to read of someone who is so gifted. To enter the exciting world of music and feel the passion even as a bystander is entrancing. Reading of how the different cello's required different care depending on their wood and strings and how each made its own unique sounds was an education in itself.<br />And the book swept me up not only musically but emotionally. Frankly I was shocked by the revelations from Hilary. At one point in the book, Jackie was emotionally weak and supposedly too distraught to be alone so she slept with Hilary and Hilary's husband Kiffer in the same bed.<br />In the next few chapters Hilary is upset to discover that her husband sleeps with Jackie on numerous occasions to keep her (Jackie) from plumeting into dispair. But Hilary is stoic realizing it was necessary for Jackies &quot;mental health&quot;.  Emotionally, I felt like slapping some sense into Hilary. Since when do you invite your sister to share the same bed as you and your husband and not expect some repercussions.<br />This self sacrificing behavior so that, &quot;what Jackie wants, Jackie gets&quot; is evident throughout the book.<br />Eventually Jackie is diagnosed with MS and begins verbally abusing those around her.

This is a slim, handy, journal that really helps make carb counting easy. Instead of recording what you eat on tiny scraps of paper you may lose easily or using complicated journals, this book simplifies the process.<br />The first page has space for you to record your goals including, current and desired weight, measurements, and current and desired exercise.<br />Then the book begins with Day 1 where you will find spaces to include the date, your weight and general comments. Each meal is listed in order of breakfast, lunch, dinner and then snacks.<br />Next to where you record what you ate there is a space to fill in the carbs.<br />At the end of each week there is a progress report where you can fill in your accomplishments and goals for the following week.<br />The journal covers 16 full weeks so its easy to look back and see the progress or mis-steps you have made. And the spiral bound journal lays flat, so it's easy to write in.<br />The back of the journal includes a list of common foods and their carb counts.<br />Though the journal is a bit large for smaller pocketbooks (8&quot;tall by 4&quot; wide), it will fit in a larger bag or a briefcase easily.<br />Another nice touch are the little hints and tips that appear on some of the pages, to help you make your low carbohydrate diet a success. Sample tip, &quot; When you want a snack reach for tasty low-carb cheese. Wrap up some slices of your favorite kind and bring them along to the movies in place of popcorn.&quot;<br />The book is a super nice tool to help you track your progress!	2003-01-28

This is Atkins pocketsized Carbohydrate Gram Counter updated and expanded.<br />For each food item listed carbs, fiber, net carbs, protein, fat and calories are included. A nice difference between this and the older version of the book is the inclusion of net carbs.<br />The net carb of a food is the impact it will make on your body. These are the only carbs you need to count because they exclude carbohydrates and sugar alcohols.<br />The mini book begins with an introduction that explains the science behind why it's carbohydrates we need to be concerned with not fat. Then the book gives a very basic overview of the Atkins plan. One page also gives portion size guidelines. Really handy. For example 2T peanut butter is about the size of 2 teabags.<br />The rest of the book is devoted to food and beverage counts. Though the book is not as comprehensive as a larger book such as Corrine Netzger's Book of Food Counts it covers quite a few foods.<br />If you are only purchasing one guide, I would purchase a larger one as it is more comprehensive. But its really helpful to have this little book in your purse, pocket or car for quick checks of what you are eating.<br />The small size makes it easy to tote. The back of the book gives tips for dining out and has a small list of popular restaurants and the counts for their food items.<br />I liked the book so well, I purchased two. One for my purse and the other for quick checks on the kitchen counter!	2003-01-28

As many people know, losing weight is often times easier than keeping it off. Atkins addresses this issue in his latest book, \\"Atkins For Life\\".<br />The book \\"Atkins for Life\\" is an excellent resource book. It is filled with practical advice and tips on how to make your low carbohydrate weight loss a permanent success.<br />Over the years Atkins name has been maligned and sneered at as he pioneered the idea that its not the fat in our diet that makes us fat its the excessive amounts of carbohydrates we have been consuming. The low fat diet was presented to Americans as the best way and the healthiest way to lose weight. However, recent research  has revealed the low fat diet to be a miserable failure. As the fat has been taken out of the diet carbohydrates have been added in their place and many Americans have become obese and unhealthy. Dr. Atkin's proposal that eating less carbs can lead to weight loss and better health has been vindicated.<br />The Atkins weight loss method is a 4 step approach. Phase 1 INDUCTION is where you limit your carbs to 20 grams per day to jump start your weight loss program. Phase 2 OWL or ONGOING WEIGHT LOSS allows you to slowly add back carbs until you discover the amount of carbs you can eat and still lose weight.<BR>Phase 3 PRE-MAINTENANCE has you slow your weight loss by adding in more carbs so good eating habits become ingrained. And in Phase 4 LIFETIME MAINTENANCE you learn to enjoy a wider variety of foods and maintain your weight loss. This book \\"Atkins for Life\\" discusses each of the phases but is mainly concerned with Phase 4 LIFETIME MAINTENANCE.<BR>You can learn what to do to lose weight with this book, but for in depth information, you would be better off selecting \\"Dr. Atkins New Diet Revolution\\".<br />This book covers in great detail how to maintain the weight you have lost. Part One: A Lifetime Plan recaps the Atkins program. It includes information on the diet, the effect on your body, putting it into practice and howto benefit from exercise. Part Two: Eating for Life teaches you how to get your kitchen in order, and gives thirty meal plans with carb counts. It includes twenty meal plans for special occasions. 125 recipes for success are also given.<br />YES you can eat carbohydrates. You can have bread, cake and pizza or even wine. The key of course is knowing how many carbohydrates your body can handle each day without gaining weight. And using techniques to get the most bang from your carbohydrate buck. These techniques are taught in the book. For example if you crave bread Atkins has several pages of information to help you make the best selection. Breads are ranked on their ability to effect your insulin levels. There are also tips on how to enjoy bread without overdoing it such as eating the crust only. Atkins shares techniques like this for a variety of foods.<br />Comfort foods are a big issue for many. Atkins tells you what to choose or what to substitute. Eating out is another area covered. Best choices at different restaurants is given in detail. Atkins also includes mental tips to help you avoid backsliding.<br />Key to the book is the detailed menu plans given for 4 ranges of carb levels at 45g, 60g, 80g and 100g . Just adjust up or down so you are at your level (which you learn from his diet).  Meal plans are simple and include snacks.  A sample day for a 60 g plan would include 1 slice lemon zucchini bread, with an egg and ricotta cheese for breakfast. Meat loaf with whole-grain bread and salad for lunch.<BR>Jerk shrimp with pasta or collard greens for dinner and 1/2 cup of cantaloupe for a snack. Carb counts are given so you can substitute as desired.<br />Crab Deviled Eggs, Cherry Muffins, Mixed Berry Shortcakes, Pinwheel Cookies, Roasted Chicken and Feta Cheese Wrap, Chocolate Souffle and Southwestern Style Pork Fajitas are among the 125 recipes. Recipes include nutritional information, but are not pictured. <br />The 370 page book also includes self tests andquizzes to help you stay on task. My favorite part of \\"Atkins For Life\\" has to be the success stories. There are a number of remarkable stories in the book with black and white photos included! Very inspiring!<br />The book \\"Atkins For Life\\" makes living a low carb life in our high carb world  easier and enjoyable! I highly recommend it!	2003-01-26

The Midlife Miracle Diet is according to the author a method where you can take back control of your eating habits, lose weight and become healthier.<br />The diet has 4 basic steps. First you achieve BASIC BALANCE by cutting back your carbohydrate intake. Next you go to CARB CAREFUL where you further cut back on carbs. You also add SUPPLEMENTS that will help you balance your blood sugar and you add EXERCISE.<br />There are many good ideas throughout the book. Adele tells you never to get hungry so your blood sugar will stay on keel. She recommends hard chews (like an apple) and soft chews (like tangerines) to satisfy your hunger needs. Adele includes food choices to select from that will help you stay in control.<br />Unlike other low carbohydrate diets where you suddenly go from eating what is normal for you to eating low carbs, in this diet, according to Adele, the transition is gradual. The first step Basic Balance removes many carbs but in a gentle way. The next step Carb Careful removes more when you are ready.  Personally, I did not see a large difference in the two steps. For example in Carb Careful she suggests removing cereal and grains from your breakfast meal, but then includes bread in the menu plan.<br />Menu plans are included for both Carb Careful and Basic Balance.<br />These may get you in balance and in control of your food but they are pretty stringent. In one example, a client of hers, eats a handful of string beans with other veggies several times a day and portions of protein, with a tiny amount of grain and fat included. The menu plans to me were pretty joyless. There was no mention of wine or chocolate, fat free cheeses were used, etc. Can you eat this way for life?<br />One of the reasons that low carbohydrate dieting can be so successful is that the fats in the diet are so satisfying. They add a richness that helps make up for the lack of carbohydrates we are used to.  Adele does not mention fat much in her book. A menu might have a tad of olive oil or a bit of cheese but not much more. I feel many folks will not be satisfied eating both low carbohydrate and low fat. And recent studies have shown that good fats are good for you to eat. So she could have included more of these in the sample plans and at the very least more information on how to treat fat in your diet.<br />Another area Adele discusses in depth is supplementation. She makes suggestions for different nutrients and explains what they can do to help you. She also sells these nutrients at her website and to her credit does not push her own products at all.<br />Exercise is also covered. She discusses how it can really help your insulin. One suggestion she gives as an exercise choice is TY BO. It made me wonder how quickly the book was put together as the correct spelling is TAE BO. With the lack of information on fats and the obvious spelling error, I wondered if perhaps the book was put out fast.<br />I think alot of Adele Puhn's warmth and regard for her clients comes through in the book.

A diet rich in protein with moderate amounts of carbs added will trigger satisfaction and help curb temptation.<br />Eating a lower carb diet is not new. There are a number of books on the market that espouse the low carb lifestyle. However, many of them are so scientific they are hard to understand. Others lay out plans that have you severely restrict carbs from your diet. Strict low carb diets are hard to stay with over the long haul.<br />That's where the Brennan's book differs. Their book, &quot;Play Your Carbs Right&quot; offers a kind, gentle, low carb eating plan that you can commit to for life!<br />I first learned about the Brennan's when I came across the books &quot;Sugar Bust For Life! with the Brennans&quot; and &quot;Sugar Bust for Life! with the Brennans Part II&quot; at a book store. I love the books!<br />They are chocka'block with great recipes, wine lists,  tips and more on following a low sugar, healthy diet.  So when I learned they had recently released another book, &quot;Play Your Carbs Right&quot;, I decided to pick up a copy.<br />As I read through the book something &quot;clicked&quot; for me. Over the past years I have read a number of different diet books that teach the low carb lifestyle. (I had already tried and failed at calorie counting and eating low fat) Despite trying some of the plans I couldn't stick to them. Either too complicated, too strict, or just plain boring. But &quot;Play Your Carbs Right!&quot;  spelled out in simple terms what I had to do to accomplish my weight loss goal. AND IN AN ENJOYABLE WAY THAT I COULD STICK TO FOR LIFE!<br />It absolutely simplifies low carb dieting. It explains in easy terms why low carb dieting is an effective weight loss method. It teaches you how to figure out your personal carb intake to lose and maintain your weight. It lists daily menus for several weeks, snack ideas, and a handy mini carb counter. I started losing right away!<br />The book also includes a ton of delicious low carb recipes.<br />The Brennan's own the well known Brennan's restaurant in New Orleans. The recipes in &quot;Play Your Carbs Right&quot; are based on their many years of working in the food industry. These are recipes for folks who love to eat and want delicious meals that satisfy.<br />Unfortunately many low carb diet books contain alot of awful dishes. (I hate to think of the times I have wasted food as low carb recipes I made came out inedible.)<br />The Brennan's book is an exception. I have tried a number of the recipes and they are great! There are a variety of recipes including: Appetizers, Sauces, Soups, Stocks, Salads, Salad Dressings, Mayonnaise, Omelettes, Frittatas and Quiches, Entrees, Side Dishes or Vegetarian's Fare, and Desserts and Dessert Beverages.<br />Some of my favorites include Classic Buffalo Wings, Asparagus Bisque, Green Bean Salad, Creamed Lemon Chicken with Asparagus, Ellen's Crabmeat Salad, Pecan Crust and Italian Shrimp.<br />The recipes are not only delicious but they are easy to make and call for ingredients that are easy to find! Each recipe also includes carb counts per serving.<br />It's my personal belief that more and more folks will realize that weight loss does not have to involve starvation diets or over analyzing the nutrients you eat. The key is simply to be smart about carbs.<br />If you watch the carbs you eat, you can eat delicious, filling meals and snacks. By making smart carb choices you will lose weight quickly, without hunger and become healthier.<br />&quot;Play Your Carbs Right!&quot; is a great guide to help you get healthy and lose weight!

Books	5	186	194	N	N	Eat, drink and lose weight with Suzanne Somers!	How would you like to drink red wine, eat rich chocolate, suck down creme brulee and still wear size S or M?<br />Wouldn't you love to have a thick porkchop smothered in mushrooms with creamy sauce? Or how about fried chicken wings with bleu cheese dip?<br />But no you can't eat any of this because you are (pick one or two or more) counting calories, counting points, drinking weight loss shakes or whatever.<br />Well guess what? You can eat rich fatty foods. (Fat is your best friend on this diet!) You can drink wine. You can eat chocolate, cheese, and other foods you may have given up in order to lose weight. You really CAN have your steak and eat it too!<br />The secret is Somersizing. Somersizing is a method of eating foods in certain combinations so your insulin levels stay on an even keel and fat is not stored. When you eat this way, you can enjoy creamy sauces, steak, and cheese and not gain weight.<br />\\"Suzanne Somers Fast & Easy\\" is a book by Suzanne Somers that explains this weight loss method and how it works. This book like her previous books explains in detail how to \\"Somersize\\". And like her previous books it continues to refine and develop the program. I feel that many of Suzanne's original ideas were based on the work of French weight loss guru, \\"Montignac\\".  There are so many similarities in his diet and hers.  But many diets are based on others and Suzanne has greatly developed the plan.<br />In this book Suzanne recaps the weight loss method and then gives information on how to make the program work faster and easier! To make the weight loss faster, Suzanne suggests eating fewer meals with carbohydrates. To make meal planning simpler, Suzanne includes a number of family friendly foods that are quick to prepare that everyone will enjoy. There are over 100 new Somersized recipes in the book.<br />\\"Suzanne Somers' Fast & Easy\\" also includes information on supplements to take to enhance health and weight loss. The book has an extended question and answer section.<br /><br />Her books are carefully written with a lot of detail. The photographs are lavish. She makes the \\"diet\\" a sensuous pleasure.<br />\\"Fast and Easy\\" begins with an introduction by Michael Galitzer MD praising Suzanne's work. He discusses why he thinks her plan is safe and effective.<br />Next the book gets into Somersizing information. With Somersizing you don't have to worry about counting points or calories, you just combine correctly. Suzanne explains all the combinations. Exactly what you need to do to lose weight. She also tells you how to \\"cheat\\" once you have lost your weight.<br />When I started on the program it was like manna from heaven.<br />I never dreamed I could nibble on cheese, eat full fat dressings and suck down mousse and lose weight! But I did and so can you, if you follow the Somersize rules.<br />Most of the weight loss information is a repeat from her other books with some surprising updates. She now says a potato a few times a week is ok for level 2 (the level after weight loss). She also covers in detail, healthy habits to develop as a family.<br />The section on health supplements is written by Paul Schulick. Schulick is President of a company that will be making supplements for Suzanne. Some of the ingredients in her supplements like green tea and cola nut contain caffeine (a no no for Somersizing) so I am not sure how they will fit these in with the Somersize program.<br />The next chapter deals with frequently asked questions. Most of the questions deal with the nitty gritty of Somersizing, if certain foods are allowed, differences between level one and level two etc.<br />Suzanne has a lot of products she sells at her website and at a home shopping site.<br />Suzanne's products include salad dressing mixes, a bread maker, jam, creme brulee (my favorite) chocolate truffles, pasta sauces and more! These are all available as a convenience to the avid Somersizer. And Suzanne refers to their availability frequently throughout her book.<br />Another section in the book is the extensive recipe section. A lot of family favorites here. Mac and Cheese, Fish and Chips, Pinwheels, Chicken Nuggets and Taco Salad. More sophisticated fare is also included. Scallop Kabobs, Chilantro Lime Grilled Tuna and Raspberry Meringue Cake.<br />She also includes recipes for her Somersize secret sauce, ketchup and tartar sauce. These are items she sells at her website. I have been buying the delicious secret and tartar sauce and now can make them for much less.<br />The last section of her book includes a summary of the program for quick reference. An index is included so you can easily find information or a recipe.<br />Though food combining is not the way most of us are used to eating, it appears that it can be very effective for weight loss. Members of the Somersize list I am on have lost hundreds of pounds! And it's obvious that the lowfat diets Americans are following today are not working as obesity rates are higher than ever. Once you get used to the Somersize method, it becomes second nature. Many people, like myself prefer to give up some starches in exchange for the rich, creamy delights we can now enjoy.<br />The food combining is described in detail in her book, but a summary is below.<br />1. Eliminate all Funky Foods.<br />2. Eat Fruits alone.<br />3. Eat Proteins/Fats with veggies.<br />4. Eat Carbos with Veggies and no fats.<br />5. Keep Proteins/Fats seperate from Carbos<br />6. Wait three hours between meals if switching from a Pro/Fats to a Carbos meal or vice versa.<br />7. Do not skip meals.<br />The book is nicely bound, with lovely photographs and clear typesetting. I do think the cover could have been better. On the cover Suzanne is jumping in a black bathing suit. The back of the book includes a full index and a handy reference guide.<br />The bottom line is if you want to decrease your \\"bottom line\\" and you are tired of low fat diets that leave you hungry and deprived, if you want to try a lifestyle plan that offers plenty of support in the form of books, her website and yahoogroups,<br />if you want to eat rich, healthy foods till you are satisfied and feel fit..then you should check out Somersizing and Suzanne Somers' Fast & Easy!hout her book. <br />Another section in the book is the extensive recipe section.

Which is most likely to fill you up? Or you could have 1 chicken nugget at 80 calories or 1and 1/2 cups veggie lentil soup for 80 calories!<br />Now granted the larger books give more examples, and more information.

Picture Perfect Weight Loss Shoppers Guide is the companion book to Dr. Shapiro's original book Picture Perfect Weight Loss (PPWL).<br />The book PPWL uses visual pictures to help readers realize the differences in calories between items. For example, you could eat one black and white cookie or eat a whole box of fudge pops!<br />The intent of the book PPWL is to help you become aware of your food choices in order to make healthier choices and/or lose weight.<br />The PPWL Shopper's Guide takes the information from the original book one step further by giving you brand name items to look for in your grocery store. The guide does not show the stunning pictures like the original book does. Instead it &quot;walks&quot; you through the supermarket aisles and helps you make good choices.<br />It's like having Dr. Shapiro or one of his assistants with you. At the beginning of the book Shapiro recaps the PPWL program. Then he teaches you how to read food labels. Next you are given a list of anytime foods. These are items to keep around all the time. Fruits and veggies head the list. But there are also some surprises, like tootsie pops, and frozen desserts.<br />Item by item, Dr. Shapiro walks you throught the grocery store and helps you fill your cart with delicious, nutritious foods that will keep the pounds off.  You learn what to look for in the dairy section, frozen food aisle, meat area, bread shelf etc. Depriviation and dieting are things of the past! You can eat well, lose weight and enjoy by making simple changes!<br />Though smaller than many books the PPWL Shopper's Guide is not pocketsized. Its a book you would be more likely to read at home and then go shopping. I would like to see Dr. Shapiro put out an additional book. A tiny brand name shoppers guide that you could tuck in your pocket and use at the store. This book has that information but so much additional info that sizewise its more for home use and to make a grocery list from. Hopefully, Dr. Shapiro will put out a condensed, handy to carry version in the future.<br />The book is an excellent source of information and will help you make the best supermarket choices to improve your health and or achieve permanent weight loss!put out a condensed, handy to carry version in the future.<br />The book is an excellent source of information and will help you make the best supermarket choices to improve your health and or achieve permanent weight loss!	2002-08-14

Carmelized scallops on a bed of asparagus with plum tomatoes. Rice with artichoke sauce. A sliver of bread. Followed by a small scoop of lite chocolate ice cream with 2 plump strawberries dipped in chocolate.<br />All washed down with a fine burgandy wine.<br />Just a typical meal on &quot;Dr. Shapiro's Weight Loss 30 Day Plan.&quot; The 30 day plan walks you day by day into a slimmer, healthier you. Part 1 focuses on how everyone from children to the elderly can benefit from &quot;Picture Perfect&quot; eating. Part II includes 4 weeks of developing a healthier lifestyle. Chapters include; Lets Go Shopping, Focus on Breakfast, A New View of Lunch and Snacks, Whats for Dinner, Lets Eat Out and Celebrate. Part III of the book includes information to make the eating plan a lifelong habit.<br />I discovered Dr. Shapiro's first book, &quot;Picture Perfect Weight Loss&quot; some years ago. In his first book and this one, he gives side by side visual pictures of food choices.<br />I thought the book was interesting, but couldn't see how it would really help you lose weight. After all there are many more food choices then the ones shown in his book.<br />BUT after trying a number of weight loss plans and ending up well with more extra pounds than ever I decided to actually try the program.<br />To my amazement it works. The pounds are sliding off with ease and I LOVE eating this way. It is definately a program I can follow for my life. The core of the program is FAT (food awareness training). You don't have to worry about counting fats, sugar, carbs, proteins, or calories. But you have to be aware of the calories in the foods you eat.<br />In the book, Dr. Shapiro shows picture comparisons of foods. For example he says you can have 1 soft pretzel at 480 calories OR you could have 4 boxes of Cracker Jacks for the same amount. You could eat 1 pint of premium ice cream OR 4 pints of sorbet, or 42 low cal. mousse bars. Dr. Shapiro does not expect you to eat 42 low cal bars of course. What he is saying is if you make the lower calorie choice you will not need as much to fill up and hence you will lose weight.<br />Well most of us know that eating fewer calories equals weight loss. BUT the caloric values of foods sink in better when you see pictures that give you a choice of food items such as one slice of zucchini bread at 580 calories versus eating 1 box strawberries, 1 honeydew melon, 1 nectarine, 3 apricots, 3/4lb grapes, 1 box blackberries, 1 roll (also 580 calories for all).<br />What you do is apply this knowledge. You don't have to count calories as I mentioned earlier. But by becoming aware of the calories in food items (by reading labels, etc) and frequently making the lower caloric choices in your every day life, you will lose weight. The visual pictures in the book will help hammer calorie differences home.<br />When I saw that I could eat 1 pint of rice for 440 calories or eat 8 boiled new potatoes, 1 baked sweet potato and 1 ear of corn. It was a no brainer. Now as I go throughout my day I think of my choices and choose the lower calorie food.<br />If I want junk food I eat a tootsie pop at 60 calories which lasts a lot longer than gummy candy at 100 calories per oz.<br />If I want a sweet desert I don't think I will be good by grabbing the tiny piece of lemon tart (450 calories) but know that I can either have the large piece of chocolate cake I really want for the same 450 calories or elect to have a lower calorie choice like a frozen mousse pop (40 calories) or chocolate dipped strawberries (about 10 calories each).<br />I find I can eat more of less caloric food, enjoy my choices and lose weight.<br />The plan works well for me. By making small changes the weight is coming off. The one drawback I see though for many folks is that Dr. Shapiro suggests eating veggie protein items instead of real steak, pork, burger etc.<br />Since I don't eat red meat anyway, for me its not a problem. Many of his clients also have no troublemaking the switch.<br />But I imagine that others who have strong hankerings for meat would have difficultly. But the beauty of the program is you don't have to give up any food. You just should be aware of the choices you are making and make wise ones that will allow you to meet your goals. If you want a high calorie chunk of meat, by all means eat it, just make lower calorie choices throughout the day.<br />I love this method of weight loss. No more deprivation,or counting. Just becoming aware and making wise choices!ble making the switch. <BR>But I imagine that others who have strong hankerings for meat would have difficultly.

I was sure I had found the answer. I quickly lost weight and found my cravings were under control. I wrote a glowing review recommending the book at this site.<br />But sadly, my happiness was short lived. Within 6 weeks, I found I really craved carbs. (Lean for Life is high protein). The strictness of the program was no longer freeing. My cravings were back full force and I couldn't stand to be on the program any longer.<br />The guilt. Here I had strongly recommended the book. Then I read &quot;The Fat of the Land.&quot; In the book the author states that folks are so hyped up about quick weight loss with high protein diets that they share this with others. BUT Fumato goes on to say that the weight loss is almost always temporary. But by that time folks have recommended the diet to many others.<br />For this I apologize. It took several weeks for my system to get back to normal. I regained all that I lost and then some.<br />I have several Lean For Life email buddies and I am sorry to say that THEY ALL REGAINED THEIR WEIGHT. They have all switched to other programs.<br />Perhaps Lean for Life works for some. But please be aware its a high protein diet and one you will have to stay on for life.<br />Can you do it? Perhaps you are better off making small lifestyle changes that add up to big results. Think hard before you go on this plan and disregard my earlier glowing review.<br />Its hard to reveal that I failed with this plan I was so enthusiastic about, but I hope my sharing this will help someone else.	2002-07-25

The book \\"Outwit Your Weight\\" by Cathy Nonas, R.D. was so jam packed with easy to follow new tips and ideas for managing weight I picked up her companion book, the \\"Outwit Your Weight Journal\\".<br />Studies show that the best tool for weight loss success is journaling. In one study it was shown that people gain as much as 500% more weight during the holiday season than during non-holiday weeks. But a few folks actually lost weight during the holidays. Who were these lucky people? The folks who kept journals.  Another study showed that folks who kept food journals for 15 weeks lost 64% more weight than those who didn't!<br />Journaling can be key to a successful weight loss journey. Knowing how important this tool is Cathy developed the \\"Outwit Your Weight Journal\\". This is very different from your traditional journals. In this book Cathy works with you to customize a journal style that will meet your needs and that you will actually \\"do\\" to meet your weight loss goals.<br />Some journals focus on calorie counting, others on exercise or fat grams. Cathy's book focuses on what YOU need.<br />The book begins with a simple self assessment of your diet danger zones. Do you nibble to much. Eat when you are lonely or bored. Eat when you read or eat due to medications?<br />And what is your weight loss personality?  Are you a restrained eater with periods of extreme eating styles? Are you an ostrich -in denial about what you eat?<br />Once you have identified your eating personality, Cathy introduces 6 different types fo journals that may suit your needs. She gives charts to fill in for the different styles.<br />You can stick to one type of journal or switch as your needs change.<br />Cathy also gives a lot of other information in the book. She includes \\"smart strategies\\" to make the best use of journaling. A full section is devoted to developing goals. Guidelines are given for exercise.<br />The one drawback to this softcover book is that it doesn't lay flat so writing in it can be awkward. But I think the author intends for it to be used as a stepping stone. That you try out different journal styles (or find one instantly) and use that style in a blank book or copy the pages.<br />By personalizing a journal to suit your needs and finding the journal style you are comfortable with you are more likely to use journaling which has led so many to weight loss success!it can be awkward.

She covers topics I normally don't read about.<br />Thus it was sort of a shock to read her thoughts and how comfortable she is being a blatantly sexual person.<br />But I decided to open my mind to what Mama Gena shares in her book and I must say she has changed my outlook on life!<br />The goal of the book is to teach women to celebrate their gloriousness. She believes that many of us have let pleasure slip away. But we can become magnets with the power to attract good things by becoming attuned to our sensuality.<br />Mama Gena (Regena Thomashauer) feels women are Goddesses and should be treated as such. What do you enjoy? Do it. Of course there are many self-help books that support trying to discover your dreams. But Mama lends a new twist. She teaches you how to become attuned to your mystical and creative powers, to be fully in touch with your sensuality so you can be transformed into a glowing Goddess. As a woman pleasure is your birthright!<br />Buy yourself gifts, brag, flirt. Too much time in our lifes is spent focusing on what is wrong with ourselves according to Mama. Within the pages of her book are exercises, and inspiration to help you fufill your potential.<br />I read about Mama Gena in a popular woman's magazine. Apparently taking a course with her runs in the hundreds of dollars. But women report remarkable results, promotions, new beaus, weight loss and more.<br />Now you can fully enhance your feminity and claim the pleasure you deserve for the small price of the book!	2002-04-27

LEAN FOR LIFE WORKS and I don't need to read anymore diet books!<br />The book \\"Lean For Life\\" has since been updated and retitled. It's now called \\"Lean For Life Phase One\\" and is available ... and at leanforlife.com. I would advise purchasing the new version instead of shelling out the extra money for an out of print copy of the original Lean for Life.<br />Lean for Life Phase One is a book that you do. Each day you are given step by step directions to follow to mentally and physically achieve your weight loss goals.<br />The program begins with a \\"prep\\" period where you buy the items you need for the diet and prepare yourself mentally.<br />The next 3 days are protein days. You select protein choices from a given list. I was shocked to find that it was easy. I ate cheese, yogurt, drank milk, protein bars, nibbled on chicken, eggs and more.<br />This is followed by a period where you add vegetables, grains and fruit from a list. The program is designed to get your body in a state of ketosis so you do not experience cravings, mood problems etc. AND IT WORKS!<br />On previous programs I had cravings for sweets and could not stick with the plan. But with LFL your cravings (if any) are very manageable and you eat so you are not hungry!<br />Each day adds in new mental concepts to work on to learn to become LEAN FOR LIFE. Exercise is also included - how much to do and when to do it for best effect.<br />After a cycle of weight loss you go into a period of metabolic adjustment adding in yet more food. Then you can repeat the cycle of weight loss if you need to lose more or you can go on to the carefully designed maintenance plan. Everything is planned out so you will become LEAN FOR LIFE and not gain the weigh back!<br />I have lost weight quickly, safely and with ease. It's a wonderful program and I highly recommend it! I am finally achieving my weight loss goals thanks to LEAN FOR LIFE!finally achieving my weight loss goals thanks to LEAN FOR LIFE!	2002-04-20

This is a fun book for those who want to kickstart a makeover.<br />Diane Irons presents 14 days of &quot;tasks&quot; to accomplish to help you achieve your best.<br />The Boot Camp begins with a simple diet that is low sugar, high protein and chalk full of complex carbohydrates and vegetables. She also gives tips on how to make the diet effective. Her suggestions include drinking green tea, filling up with fiber, drinking tons of water and more.<br />Though I elected not to follow her menu plan, I still found the rest of her book to be worth the price.<br />Within days I found I had streamlined my beauty routine, given my bathroom a spalike appearance through some inexpensive additions, pared down my wardrobe, cleaned my pantry and more! Diane's book gave me the &quot;kick&quot; I needed to get it done.<br />Each page in the book provides tips and tricks to make your self look, and feel better physically and mentally!<br />Day 1 of boot camp begins with decluttering your environment. A great way to start feeling in control. This is one area where Diane falters though. In one day, I was supposed to have my kitchen cleaned, wardrobe sorted, bathroom dejunked, etc. etc. These are pretty big projects and the kitchen alone can take a good day or so.<br />So the title of the book &quot;14 Day Beauty Boot Camp&quot; is not truly an accurate name but its certainly catchy!<br />What I decided to do, was follow the information for day 1. When I had completed all the tasks go on to day 2. This may take several weeks for some as cleaning out your closet, washing hairbrushes and turning your bathroom into a slice of heaven are time consuming projects!<br />Despite the fact that the timing is not accurate, the book is still a great source of inspiration and a fun way to trim your weight, improve your wardrobe, boost energy and more!<br />What I especially enjoy about the book is the tips Diane includes for developing that special attitude. And Diane's beauty tips are different than the common fare repeated in women's magazines.<br />The book is easy to manage (not bulky like some of the recent beauty books on the market), and is written in an easy to read format. It comes with a bonus audio CD by Diane inspiring you each step of the way.<br />Reading and acting on the suggestions in this book will be like having a personal trainer to help you develop your best style at a fraction of the cost!he common fare repeated in women's magazines.<br />The book is easy to manage (not bulky like some of the recent beauty books on the market), and is written in an easy to read format.

If you are a traditional dieter you may enjoy Tallmadge's book, &quot;Diet Simple&quot;. In the book Tallmadge gives a number of tips on how to fit in exercise and eat less calories. However, most of the tips will be ones you already know. And many of the tips are repeated in the book in a slightly different manner.<br />For example one tip suggests you walk a dog, another tip says you lead a conga line at work for 5 minutes each hour of the business day, and yet another tip suggests you walk more.<br />Other Tallmadge tips include eating less calories by making substitutions. She suggests in one tip that you give up ice cream or at least eat less. And another tips suggests you eat fruit with chocolate syrup instead of ice cream - more repetition.<br />Very few of the ideas add anything new to what most women's magazines or diet books will tell you. Drink more water to feel fuller, eat salad so you don't eat something else, find less caloric substitutes for chocolate cravings.<br />The one twist Katherine adds to the book is she guesses at how many calories (and thus pounds) you might lose in a year if you follow the suggestion given.<br />As I stated earlier the book is geared to the traditional eat less, exercise more mode of weight loss. If you are following a low carb diet, for example, many of the suggestions will not work for you. In one tip she recommends coating your berries with chocolate syrup.  2 tablespoons of chocolate syrup contain 24 grams of carbs which would not be beneficial to a low carber!<br />At the back of the book she gives batch recipes. Many are geared to a batch for 4 or 6. So they not as suitable for families as they are for couples. The recipes involve wholesome foods and clear directions are given.<br />I think because of the duplication of the tips throughout the book and the fact that most are repeats of what we already know the book is more of a little kick in the pants to remind us to drink our water, eat more veggies etc.<br />To me though the lack of new information does not merit the price of the hardcover version.hough the lack of new information does not merit the price of the hardcover version.	2002-04-14

Anne Barone's book &quot;Chic &amp; Slim Encore&quot; is a favorite on my bookshelf, so I was delighted to discover her earlier work &quot;Chic &amp; Slim&quot; has been reprinted.<br />&quot;Chic &amp; Slim&quot; is the original book written by Anne Barone to share the secrets of how the French women eat rich foods, drink wine, are rarely seen at the gym and still manage to wear size SMALL!<br />The key according to Anne is the choices the French woman makes. She chooses natural unprocessed foods. Portion sizes are smaller. Exercise is fit in naturally by walking everywhere. Water not soda is the beverage of choice. Sugar is eaten in moderate quantities.<br />Instead of aiming for quantity, the French aim for quality. Eating a small slice of the finest pastry instead of a whole box of processed twinkies.  Drinking one or two glasses of red wine instead of a number of unhealthy cocktails. Don't supersize your fries and double your burger. Instead eat a little portion of &quot;pomme frites&quot; with a palm size piece of grilled chicken. Forget the salad dressings with synthetic ingredients instead dress your lettuce with just a bit of heart healthy olive oil and vinegar.<br />Anne also goes into &quot;ATTITUDE&quot;. The French women sees herself as a beautiful women despite her physical flaws. She is worth the effort of eating well, taking care of herself. She deserves to be slim and healthy. Many American women are unfortunately caught in a cycle of trying to look like the models we see in magazines instead of enjoying what we have and making the most of it.<br />The French woman does things that make her feel good about herself. She dresses to look and feel her best. No sloppy sweats and big gym shoes. Clothing that makes her feel feminine. A perfume that reflects her personality.<br />The book &quot;Chic &amp; Slim&quot; also shares Anne's triumph of losing weight when she stopped dieting and started eating like the French. She shares more of her ideas at her website annebarone.com.<br />&quot;Chic &amp; Slim&quot; like its sister book, &quot;&quot;Chic &amp; Slim Encore&quot; is a must read for the woman who wants to learn to enjoy and appreciate herself more. The woman who wants to get off the diet rollercoaster and learn to eat sensibly and with joy.

Preperation time ranges from as few as 5minutes for Baked Eggs with Scampi to 1 and 1/2 hours for Whole Meal Gnocchi served with a Tomato and Basil coulis.<br />Montignac's eating program is NOT explained in this small recipe booklet.

Jorge Cruise has developed a quick way to &quot;jump-start&quot; your morning. By performing only 8 minutes of strength training and following a simple diet Jorge says you can shape up! In fact on the cover of his book he guarantees weight loss in just 4 weeks.<br />I think the strength training aspect of his program is very good. The photographs are clear and the descriptions for the exercises are concise. Jorge leads you through 4 sets of 12 repetitions for 2 exercises, alternating them for greater effect.<br />There are a number of exercises including standing heel raises, kickups, knee pushups, and one arm curls.<br />Despite the short time period, I could feel a nice difference in my body in under a week. Though its easy to not exercise, its hard to make excuses when it's only 8 minutes! Great Concept!<br />It would be nice if Jorge had included modifications for those who had difficulty performing the exercises.<br />Jorge also includes a motivational thought for the day. Each day has a different idea to hopefully &quot;kick&quot; you into high gear. Ideas such as visualization, using light, rewards etc. Nothing new, but a nice addition to the book.<br />The diet is your standard low calorie type fare, with one addition. Jorge has you add one tsp. of flax oil (which you can also purchase from him) or olive oil to your meals to give you that feeling of satiation. I purchased Jorge's flax oil and indeed it does make you feel full..but I found the taste was very hard to get used to. Overall, I was disappointed in the diet. Jorge does not use the new information about how glycemic levels can be effected by certain foods and he suggests foods that easily turn to sugar in your body like bananas. He also suggests eating treats alone and that could trigger cravings in some folks if not paired with a protein.<br />Jorge says he has trained over 3 million people online in his book. So I was surprised when I visited his website that it seemed like it was still in it's infancy ie chat board just starting etc. I have been on a variety of fitness websites for over 5 years and have never heard of Jorge. I was also disappointed when he suggested on the board the if we needed motivation we buy a small outfit and try to diet to get in it.<br />Personally, I think we all need to feel good NOW about our bodies and try to make them better by buying clothes that fit and adjusting down when the time is right.<br />My thoughts are that he knows his exercise but put together a diet program by gathering information from others. I don't think his diet program is anything special or the answer folks have been looking for.<br />But the book is worth the price for the exercises alone. And Jorge is young and enthusiastic and his knowledge of nutrition will grow! Hopefully his next book will include the wonderful exercises and a better nutrition plan.cy ie chat board just starting etc. I have been on a variety of fitness websites for over 5 years and have never heard of Jorge.

Somercize Desserts is a slim volume of 30 desserts accompanied by sumptious photographs! These are not diet desserts. They are made with full fat cream cheese, heavy cream, egg yolks, and chocolate. However, if the desserts are eaten according to the Sommercize rules of food combining you can enjoy them and lose weight!  If they are eaten whenever, you could gain weight.<br />The rules of combining are explained in Suzannes other books, Eat Great Lose Weight, Eat Cheat and Lose and Get Skinny on Fabulous Food. The rules are not explained in the Somercize Desserts book. She does however indicate, to those familiar with Somercizing which desserts are Level One and which are Level Two.<br />The book includes both new treats and desserts previously published in her other books. Most of the recipes include a sugar substitute Suzanne has developed called SommerSweet. She also gives substitutions using real sugar or saccharin. The SommerSweet product is available from her website and is quite pricey. Two small cans with shipping runs $24 plus.<br />One of the recipes in her book is for Truffles. She also sells the Truffles at her website for around $20 plus shipping. I purchased the Truffles from her site and enjoyed them. My husband who appreciates very fine chocolate found them to have an aftertaste. No one felt they were as good as a real truffle with sugar. But you can't have it all I guess.  I decided to make the truffles with her book and found the recipe easy to follow but the end result was not as tasty as the ones she sells.<br />Aside from the Sommersweet, other recipes call for ingredients including whole vanilla bean, wonton skins, phyllo dough, and whole wheat PASTRY flour. These items are not always easy to find. In addition one recipe calls for a springform pan and several call for an ice cream maker.<br />By the time I purchased her book, the springform pan and the ingredients to make the chocolate layer cake, I figure I had about $75 invested!<br />Other recipes in the book include, peach sorbet (ice cream maker needed) orange souffle, decaf coffee granita, creme brulee, steamed chocolate pudding, and asian napoleons.<br />The directions are easy to follow and the ingredients are clearly listed along with the serving size. Fats, fiber, calories, and carbohydrate information is not included. Book lies flat for cooking ease.<br />The book is lovely with the tempting color photographs and the recipes I have tried all turned out well. BUT considering the hard to find ingredients and the fact that the book contains only 30 recipes, its one pricey piece of cake!ipes in the book include, peach sorbet (ice cream maker needed) orange souffle, decaf coffee granita, creme brulee, steamed chocolate pudding, and asian napoleons.<br />The directions are easy to follow and the ingredients are clearly listed along with the serving size.

If you are reading this review you may be wondering why is the book French Chic by Susan Sommers so expensive. This out of print beauty sells for upwards of $100 and climbing. Yet the book was published in 1988. Fashion books come and go, so why does French Chic continue to climb in price and how has it managed to develop a popularity with little publicity.The answer is simple. The book teaches step by step methods to attain the mystique of French Style and it is one of a kind. When I got my copy of the book I was stunned. Many of the outfits seemed somewhat dated. But as I read through the book, I was captivated. The bones of the book teach what has eluded foreign admirers for years. How to truly get &quot;that look&quot;. The special chapter on 'What French Mothers Teach Their Daughters' says it all. Learning the tips on these few pages alone will make you unforgettable. In addition to the attitude and wardrobe of the French woman Summers covers the makeup. With the French the emphasis is on the lips. Though I prefer her cousin book, the less pricey &quot;Italian Style&quot; I have learned much from both books.  Another wonderful book for those who enjoy &quot;French Chic&quot; is the harder to find (not even in Amazon's database) &quot;French Style - How to Think, Dress and shop like a Frenchwoman&quot; by Veronique Vienne. All are lovely books for those wishing to look fabulous, elegant and sexy with flair!	2001-08-04
US	52362855	RFHX1GVKCY940	0060199520	326498367	Jackie Style	Books	4	69	69	N	Y	Jackie Style lush but lacking.	I was attracted to this book by its feel and the promise of learning more about that certain &quot;something&quot; Jackie radiates. After mentally debating the price, my lust for more Jackie style information won out and I purchased it. It is a substantial book in many ways but weak in others. The beginning of the book is awkward as the author describes what Jackie was thinking after her husband won the Presidency. How could the author know? The authors assumptions immediately made me question the rest of the books authenticity.  As I read through the book however, the author changed tactics and began to describe the first lady using research that was factually supported. She discusses Jackie's upbringing, her role as young woman, and beyond. Though most of the information has been written about before, several aspects were elaborated on to add a new twist and make them more interesting. For example, I had read many times about Jackie winning Vogue magazines Prix de Paris competition, but never in the detail Keough gives.  There are a number of photographs in the book but unfortunatly the way they are presented lacks impact. Many are black and white, others small for the page, few are new, and in general they don't have the luster that they could. For example, p.182 has a full size, black and white photograph of Jackie with flowers fully covering her face. If this is one of the never seen photographs Keough promises well I can see why. Another page is devoted to a full color photo of Ari Onasis. Since the full color photos of Jackie are few why not make it one of her? Pamela Keoughs previous book Audrey Style had a much better selection of pictures that made an impression! There are also some line sketches of Jackie in a pillbox.

Ian Ellis scores a hit with Book Finds - How to Find, Buy and Sell Used and Rare Books. Many book collecting books tend to be hard reads like encyclopedias. Not so &quot;Book Finds&quot;. Ian has a very reader friendly way of writing as he explores the world of collectible books. He explains how to recognize first editions. How to recognize valuable books. Mistakes to avoid. The secrets of professional book scouts. How to care for books and more! The books focus is on modern first editions. He also has a section on purchasing books over the internet. Though I learned a lot from this book there are a few points I disagree with. One is his suggestion that you will get the books you want before others if you sign up with large internet used bookstores to be notified when the books come in. In my experience, by the time you get the notification, the book has usually been sold. If you want a certain book, you must constantly search for it. He also recommends using rubber cement on a sticker on a shiny bookjacket to remove it. A simpler way to remove stickers from shiny dustjackets is an inexpensive product you can purchase at the drugstore called, &quot;Goo Gone&quot;. Rub a little on the book. Wipe and sticker is gone - no mess or fuss. He includes a list of authors that will most likely increase in value but does not include book values as they become dated quickly. Though I understand this, a few more examples of how books can rapidly increase in value by giving price information would have been interesting.  Overall, I feel the book is an outstanding find for those interested in buying and selling. Well worth the moderate price tag!	2001-08-02

If you are interested in fashion, you will love Italian Chic. This out of print book like its cousin French Chic (also written by Susan Sommers) is rapidly becoming a sought after collectible. Though French Chic has been listed for prices well over $100 Italian Chic can be found for much lower. Yet of the two books, my preference is for Italian Chic. The book written in 1992 describes how to incorporate Italian style secrets into simple to follow fashion guidelines. You will learn where to scrimp, where to splurge. How to update what you own. How to travel light and wrinkle free. Make a shawl work for every occasion. The pictures in the book are contemporary and work today. Unlike many fashion books where you are supposed to pick your look like romantic or trendy and dress accordingly Italian Chic is classic and works forever. You will learn how to work your wardrobe to your best advantage. Much is covered in this detailed book, everything from the type of jeans to wear and where they should hit on the ankle to the classic sunglass choice. There is a whole section on makeup for maximum effect. The Italians put the emphasis on the eyes. And information on how water helps the Italian skin glow. Excellent resource for those that want to look fabulous!	2001-08-02

I really couldn't wait to delve into &quot;The Bomshell Manual of Style&quot;. I expected a frothy confection of &quot;bombshellism&quot; with perhaps some tips to incorporate into my life. Sadly, I found the beautifully designed cover, illustrations and quips on the back of the dustjacket to be the best part. Yes the author shares ideas on how a bombshell behaves, eats etc. But all the examples are dated, and the author fails to translate them to today's society. If I were to wear some of the outfits the author suggests, like a large, bold print polka dotted dress with super high heels shopping I am sure I would get stares but they would not be flattering ones. The author Laren Stover uses Elizabeth Taylor, Jayne Mansfield and Marilyn Monroe frequently as examples through out the text. Certainly these women are renowed for their beauty and style. But what played then doesn't work now, even for a bombshell. Had the author also used more comtemporary &quot;stars&quot; with style and glamour such as Jodie Foster or Sharon Stone and reported on how these ladies imbue star quality and that bombshell quality to their lives, the book would be much more relevant. Suggesting that a bombshell goes on a diet as her doctor won't give her anymore pills is an insult to all modern bombshells who know the best way to lose weight is a good support group and everything in moderation. The movies a bombshell watches, books a bombshell reads, and especially the clothes a bombshell wears according to the author are in many cases limited and old fashioned. Many of the perfumes the author suggests a bombshell use are way too heavy for today's modern times. This book is so beautifully designed and so well conceived it's a great disappointment that it fails at its attempt. Should the author care to make it relevant to today and show the reader how to incorporate sassiness and style and charm into today's world it would be an excellent, fun read. But this little book will not help anyone fufill their bombshell aspirations!ill their bombshell aspirations!	2001-05-28

Opening a jar of spaghetti sauce to top some pasta seems like enough effort. I am also as happy with a simple piece of grilled chicken as I am with one smothered in rich sauces, so cooking books are not a high priority for me. I glanced through this book at the book store only because I felt the authors other book &quot;Low Fat Living&quot; was excellent. To my surprise I was immediately attracted to the simplicity of the recipes, variety and their appeal. The book presents foods that I enjoy eating, that are easy to prepare and it cuts the fat and calories. So enjoyable fare like chicken fingers, Mexican dishes, pasta creations and deserts etc. are a snap to make and healthy to eat. The author Leslie Cooper includes a lot of helpful information such as the hands on time, calories, servings, fiber,fat etc. So the foods prepared can be used if you are on a diet program like Weight Watchers (you can figure out the points)or need to watch your choleserol etc. Cooper includes items such as Mixed Greens with Pecan Vinaigrette, Miso Soup, Swiss Broccoli Soup, Pan Seared Crab Cakes, Sesame Chicken Satays etc. She also includes substitutions for some items. I found the ingredients easy to obtain. Most already in my cupboard or fridge. The beginning of the book devotes about 100 pages to ways to cook for health, fat trimming swaps, reading labels, calorie burning, stress blockers etc. Lots of useful information here. The book is wonderful on its own or as a companion to the &quot;Low Fat Living&quot; book, Leslie cowrote with her husband. It's important to note that this book and the other one is not about eating no fat or little fat. Its about eating healthy fats in moderation. Though the book is not spiral bound it does lie flat for ease of use. The only drawback with the book is the lack of pictures. Overall though its a super nice book and one I will refer to often for quick, healthy recipes!	2001-05-18

In the book the authors explain how you can turn on your bodies fat burners by making easy to follow lifestyle changes. Little changes that can add up to long term, permanent weight loss. You will learn how artificial sweeteners can increase your cravings for sweets, why breakfast is such an important meal (and what to do if you are not a breakfast eater), snacks that trigger insulin reactions (and thus cause fat storage) snacks that are great anytime, ways to decrease your desire for fats, easy ways to get moving (even if you dislike exercise), mental and physical excercises and much more.

I had never thought about the shape of the inner part of my brow that is near my nose for example. But the authors cover different effects you will achieve by shaping this in different ways. The book also includes a few celebrity pictures and their brows and explains how to achieve the look. The book is written in a friendly, easy to read manner - entertains as it educates.

In this oversized softcover book Robert Ziff M.D. explains the &quot;French Paradox&quot;.  How the French eat rich fatty foods, drink wine, etc. yet manage to stay so slim. The book is divided into three sections. In the first section Ziff describes the basic ideas behind the French eating style. He gives the formula to determine your ideal weight the French way (this was a bit complicated). He also explains the 22 principles the French naturally follow to eat well and stay sleek. These include slowing down the eating process so your stomach has a chance to savor and realize its full, eating lots of fruits and vegetables and eating moderate portions. Many of these ideas we may have already read, yet Ziff explains them in such a way that makes an impression.  Ziff describes the typical French breakfast, lunch and dinner. Section two covers basic kitchen equipment, pots, pans, knifes etc. Section three is the recipe section. He has included a variety of recipes so you can cook authentic gourmet meals at home, and lose weight. Sample recipes include: Roasted chicken with grapefruit and pink peppercorns, roast loin of pork with prunes and apples, stuffed cabbage leaves, home-style shrimp, a number of sauce recipes and many others! Though the list of recipes is extensive, it did not include any bread recipes. Since bread is a mainstay of the French diet, I would have liked to learn how to bake a loaf or what to look for in an authentic French style loaf. The tone of the book is very friendly and I feel Ziff does an excellent job of explaining how the French enjoy their cuisine and stay slender and how we can translate that to our lifestyle!	2001-01-04

This book offers a lovely look at the Parisian's way of dressing in style. The authors Virginie and Veronique Morana (mother and daughter) share their ideas on the essential wardrobe, accessories, and jewelry. They also include a chronology of French fashion, history of French perfume and shopping tips. Throughout the book Virginie and Veronique are pictured in different settings ie shopping, having tea etc wearing the types of clothes they recommend. The book is by no means an in depth guide to French style as is the out of print, comprehensive book &quot;French Chic&quot; by fashion reporter Susan Sommers, but is more of a simple, overview of the French style. The basics of French style are shared here from which you can build.  I found the photographs of the mother/daughter team a refreshing change from models. Here we see how real women translate the French clothing to the street. And the fashions shown would work well in the US. Some of the garments are laid out on a chair making it hard to see details however. In addition, though the section on jewelry was extensive as the authors own a jewelry boutique, the section on makeup was sketchy limited to a paragraph. Overall I enjoyed the little book but view it more as a light overview not a deep picture of French fashions.	2001-01-03

I read health and nutrition books for pleasure and to hopefully find a way to eliminate a few pounds without too much discomfort. I could never stay on a diet and had come to the conclusion that diets don't work anyway. Lifestyle changes do. Hence I vowed not to buy anymore diet books but couldn't resist a peek at the bookshelves to see what the new weight loss method was. When I saw Dr. Shapiro's book with all the pictures, I thought it looked like a kindergarten lesson. After years of reading about nutrition, how could I learn anything from this. But when I was given a copy, I decided to look it over. I was amazed! Though I feel that individuals need to make changes for themselves to lose weight their own way, this book provides clear cut ways to make it easy! No longer do you have to diet now you can lose weight with the choices that work for you easily and enjoyably. You may not be willing to give up your rice and meatballs (480 calories) for a 7oz pomegranate fish (280 calories)but you may be willing to forgo 1oz of yogurt pretzels (140 calories) for 2 pretzel rods(70 calories) and 4 plums (70 calories). Dr. Shapiro gives you the options. Now making the right choices has been written about before but there is nothing like a picture to amplify what the right choices are and stick in the mind! The day after reading the book, I put the principles in action. Instead of my usual 1/2 bagel with a tad of cream cheese and tea, I feasted on 2 low fat waffles with syrup, berries and tea (same calories)! The visual pictures make a huge impact! Yes the next time I am at my favorite Japanese restaurant I may still have the tempura that may not be as good a choice as the teriyaki but if I choose differently on other occasions it will work out fine. This book clearly impacts you with the choices available. The text is easy to read, clear cut and helps you recognize that this is a simple, natural way to achieve your weight goals!	2000-12-20

A few years ago, while vacationing in the Bahama's I observed a table of two French women eating lunch. They were both very slim, tres chic, and obviously not counting calories. Each woman had a full glass of red wine, some rich looking cheeses, a few crackers and a small assortment of other goodies. I couldn't help but wonder HOW they managed to remain so slim eating THAT. I was righteously nibbling on 1/2 bagel with a tad of fat (cream cheese) and some turkey protein thrown in. Yet I had at least ten pounds (ok 20)to lose. As a child I had lived in France and can still remember the delicious croissants, mouth watering chocolates, hearty breads, and rich cheeses the French ate so frequently. How did the women stay so slim? I had also noticed that the majority of them managed to look like a million dollars though I knew many of them were on tiny budgets. How did they do it? Then I came across Anne Barone's book at Amazon! Mais Oui! What a pleasure! I savored every morsel of Anne's delicious book, &quot;Chic &amp; Slim Encore&quot;. In the book Anne truly reveals how so many French women come across as attractive, chic, slim, in control, and poised regardless of the physical features nature gave them. She explains how you can eat rich, fatty, (forbidden) foods and remain tiny and terrific! What to look for in clothing so you always dress rich regardless of your pocketbook. How our feminity can be enhanced and appreciated if we so desire. The book embraces many aspects of the French culture and teaches aspects of the French lifestyle that we can use to enhance our lives. You learn how to simplify your life by aiming for quality not quantity. Moderation not accumulation. Buying the best you can afford in small amounts and forgetting the rest. Simple steps you can integrate into an active lifestyle to increase delight in the everyday! The book is a wonderful resource for enjoying and living the good life! Merci Anne!	2000-12-02

The authors claim to have developed a new 'technology'<br />called &quot;Instantaneous Transformation&quot; which is about a<br />change of states, shifting of realities. The concept is to accept and<br />be aware without judgement. This according to the Kanes can lead to a<br />quantum shift in your life by teaching you how to remain centered, be<br />increasingly satisfied, develop better relationships etc. As I read<br />through the book it all seemed so familiar. These concepts were very<br />wonderfully presented over 15 years ago by Baba Ram Dass in a book<br />called &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. It was also written with wide spacing<br />and simple sentences like this book. The concepts of<br />&quot;Instantaneous Transformation&quot; are also used in many other<br />philosophies.  .... The book has little meat and many of the stories<br />did seem to be judgemental. A characteristic they are opposed to. I<br />also disagree with the premise of becoming one with your<br />feelings. That is, if you are sad embrace it. There is much you can do<br />to uplift your mood and why not be joyous if you can be! I find that I<br />really can help determine my happiness. Yes sometimes I am down but<br />there is much I can do to brighten my day and why not do it instead of<br />surrendering to gloom. The Kane's also state that being with someone<br />close to death can be a rich experience and feel wonderful. This<br />saddens me.

Netzer Dieter's Diary: Record Everything You Eat and Drink, Chart Your Weekly Progress, Use the Handy Compact Calorie Counter, and Lose Weight	Books	5	39	40	N	N	Excellent tool for tracking your diet!	If you would like to lose weight or eat a healthier diet, experts often recommend you keep track of what you are eating. For a number of years I tried different methods. I used scraps of paper, a large notebook, a calender book, and even a complicated food journal.  Eventually I stopped journaling - too much work. Then one day I found this little spiral bound book - Corinne Netzer's Dieter's Diary. It really simplifies the tracking process! It contains an easy to use format to track your intake for 16 weeks. Each week is divided into 7 individual days and you can easily jot down what you ate throughout the day. It includes a spot to write in calories OR you can easily write in points instead if you are on the Weight Watchers program or grams of protein if you are Zoning. The back of the book has calorie counts for common foods. But even if this information is not helpful to you, the organization of the rest of the book can be a super tool to help you achieve your goals! After one week I could easily see problem areas and correct them. And the information can be reviewed over a longer time period as the booklet is for a 16 week period. At the bottom of each page is a small space to write in comments. At the end of each week is an area to write in a weekly progress report and goals for the next week. I think this is an excellent tool, simple yet very effective!	2000-11-05

Its not often you find a book that challenges the intellect, is fun to read, yet appeals to many age groups. Al Seckel has accomplished this demanding task with his book &quot;The Art of Optical Illusions&quot;. Seckel presents the illusions as if you were touring an art gallery. He acts as a guide who lets you explore the visuals freely yet helps you understand them with succinct explanations if needed. Seckel does this by dividing his book into 4 gallerys. Each gallery includes a number of illusions, one per page. At the end of each gallery there are notes that help further explain the visual. You are able to enjoy and explore the illusions and reference the notes if you wish to know more. The illusions range from the simple to the more sophisticated. Each illusion is beautifully rendered thus enhancing its effects. I was delighted to find an old favorite,&quot;the floating finger&quot; and fascinated by many I had never seen including &quot;gesture of a dancer&quot;! Approximately 150 illusions are included, some in black and white others in color. The book is in large paperback format making it reader friendly. The quality of the pages, texture and thickness enhance the pleasure of discovering each illusion. This is a book that will stimulate creativity and provide hours of pleasure for young and old alike!

In Peak Experiences you will find detailed maps including the best approach to the peak, season recommendations, visitor accomodations, gear guide, trip planning, the view and even a sweat index of the effort entailed!

It was printed in<br />1996. Another book by the author &quot;Diets Still Don't Work&quot;<br />was published in 1990 after the release of the original &quot;Diets<br />Don't Work&quot; book. The books cover essentially the same<br />information with only a few variations, so you really need purchase<br />only one or the other. I recommend this book if you are tired of the<br />diet roller coaster and want to live a naturally thin diet free life!	2000-09-02

The book touches on the &quot;Weigh Down Diet&quot; method of eating in the appendix and with  an occasional reference in the book. If you are interested in learning  about the eating program, &quot;The Weigh Down Diet&quot; book will have  more information on the plan. This book covers the growth of the Weigh Down  program, the stories of people who have lost weight with Weigh Down, and  includes lessons to help you enrich your faith and focus on spirit not  food. I liked reading alot of the information that Gwen shares but one  aspect of this book bothers me. According to Gwen &quot;God is so  good-looking, so athletic, so powerful and so charming that upon first  sight, we would all immediately bow down and adore Him.&quot; I think it is  a shame that Gwen places this value on looks. And why would we value God  because of the way he looks or his athletic ability? Can't we get past  lookism and focus on pure loving spirit? Though I appreciate the closeness  Gwen feels with the Spirit I often felt uncomfortable (as I did when I read  the Weigh Down Diet book) with the way she attributes negative qualities to  God, like jealousy etc. Though I feel God is with you always even when  shopping as Gwen says, she writes of him as if he were her boyfriend. Other  aspects of the book were very rewarding. Reading the stories of those who  were successful in their efforts to lose weight is inspiring. The spiritual  lessons Gwen shares were thought provoking. Gwen makes a strong case for  being able to walk away from drugs, food or other bad habits by focusing on  God. Her book is convincing and compelling. It is a wonderful read if you  go beyond the &quot;God is so good looking&quot; text and find the true  soul in her words.	2000-05-29

Gwen offers a lot of thought provoking ideas in her book the &quot;Weigh Down Diet&quot;. Instead of turning to food, Gwen suggests we turn to God. I really feel Gwen has a lot of spiritual richness to share. I am not  surprised that many are finding success with the program. &quot;Eat when  you are full. Stop when you are hungry&quot; thats Gwens motto and a sound  one. I give her book high marks for reminding us of what is important. I do  however, have reservations regarding this book. Thin and fit are not always  the same thing. You can be slender and not fit. Gwens suggests that you eat  whatever you want. I agree you can in moderation but I also feel one should  recognize that some foods lack nutrients. Though these foods should be  enjoyed I do feel that an effort should be made to eat nutritious, life  giving foods. But Gwen does not seem to feel this is important. How much  you eat is more important than what you eat, she says. While that may be  true for overall weight loss, it is not true for health. Her sample diet  lacks in basic nutrients. There was hardly any calcium for example. And as  Gwen does not believe in supplementing with vitamins etc. I feel the plan  could cause problems in the long run. In addition Gwen supports the use of  aspartame which some studies have shown can cause health problems. Gwen  does not appear to support exercise either. Exercise if you want, she says,  but its not going to help you lose much weight. Gwen seems to forget that  exercise helps keep you fit! She mentions that our Grandparents did not set  foot in a gym. And that may be true, but many of them led active  lifestyles. Today many of us live a  sedentary life. Exercise does not have  to be formal (ie done in a gym) but activity should be worked into the day  to stay fit.  Exercise is also wonderful for good mental health. The  spiritual aspect of the program is the core of the book. I feel Gwen writes  with her heart but I feel that each individual needs to develop their own  personal relationship with God. It will not be the same type of  relationship for everyone. Gwen has very strong feelings about what God  thinks and what God wants you to do. Her ideas of God demonstrating  negative emotions, such as jealousy etc. conflict with the idea that others  have that God is an all loving, accepting force who supports you no matter  what.  At times I was uncomfortable with Gwens thoughts. Some of what she  said just didnt feel right to me.  But Gwen does not seem to allow for  individuals to have their own feelings about God. This is what God thinks  and what God wants according to Gwen and there is no other way. Personally  I prefer to view God as a total loving spirit that will support me  regardless of if I eat too many cookies or not. Overall though I feel Gwens  book shares some interesting thoughts and her idea that too much emphasis  is on food not on the spirit is wonderful. I would recommend reading it for  some of the insights she shares. But I would also take heed that good  nutrition and exercise are very important.op their own  personal relationship with God.

This program consists of an audio and booklet that is intended to help you reprogram your subconscious to achieve your weight loss goals. The editorial reviews and authors comments are impressive. Unfortunately the  program is not. The author begins by explaining why all weight loss  programs(except his) will not work. Then he explains how the mind works to  make us either fat or thin (so far so good!). He goes on to state that by  asking ourselves the right questions, in the right manner, we can lose  weight. Instead of saying to yourself &quot;Why am I so fat?&quot; The  author suggests you should say something like &quot;What can I do to lose  weight?&quot; This is a good tool to use to help achieve objectives. BUT  His progam focuses almost totally on having the listener ask themselves  questions. And it stops there. Though I do believe the subconscious can be  a VERY important tool to use for weight loss, I dont think that Burris  explains how to use it effectively. He just tells you to ask yourself  questions in a positive way. Well that doesnt always give us answers! His  method is very skimpy and lacking in substantial information to help one  achieve their goals. In addition, though he has a nice voice his delivery  style is rushed. Its hard to follow what he is saying. I honestly do not  feel this program will offer a lot to the reader/listener.	2000-05-14

Despite its slim size (61pages) this book walks you step by step into developing a pair of lean, lovely legs. It includes a number of black and white photos featuring fitness stars such as Christine Lydon, Amy Fadhli,  Marjo Selin, Dale Tomita and others. The book explains in detail how to  create shapely legs with the right type of training. It describes the  exercises that should be done and gives photos of many. It also includes  training routines. Its divided into 6 sections which cover legs in general,  the thighs, the hamstrings, the calfs, cardio/aerobic connection, and total  leg training. The book pulls together a lot of information to help you  organize your training to achieve the type of legs you want. The only  drawback to the book is the writing style is very basic. For example the  book opens with the following &quot;Legs-like them or not you have a pair.  Your legs are essential for getting you where you want to go.&quot; Once  you get past this elementary writing the actual information given is  excellent.	2000-04-27

This little booklet (31pages) is crammed with information about chitosan. It discusses the benefits of chitosan, uses and its history. Unfortunately, its not reader friendly. It is written like a science text. However it does  offer hard to find information on chitosan. Hennen (the author) compares  chitosan to other fibers in terms of its effacy. He gives information on  how it works as a fat blocker. He also suggest substances to use with it,  to improve its effectiveness. Though the text does have alot of information  despite its slim size I think he should have covered some other important  details. For example though, he alerts the reader to use caution when  taking fat soluble vitamins at the same time as chitosan, he does not  discuss the long term possible effects. Though I personally feel careful  use of chitosan is safe, long term useage could possible deplete calcium,  vitamin E and other nutrients and this issue needs to be addressed. Though  he lists substances that increase chitosans effectiveness he does not state  why. The main problem I had with the booklet though was the lack of  information he gives on how to effectively use chitosan.  He says to take  before a high fat meal but does not detail how much per meal or how long  before. Still the booklet is very informative and helps get the message out  that though chitosan when used correctly can be an effective fat blocker,  it does NOT work like the TV commercials for chitosan type products would  like you to believe!	2000-02-17

Dr. Vigilante makes some very good points in the book &quot;Low-fat Lies High Fat Frauds&quot;. He states that society has been duped into believing the lower the fat in your diet the better. He also states that many of us  have replaced these fats with sugars and false fats. He makes the case for  olive oil as a healthy fat to add to ones diet. At the back of the book he  includes some recipes. The book has its drawbacks though. The main one is  he allots about 3/4 of the book to telling the reader why other diets dont  work. KEVIN! We already know that or we wouldn't be reading your book! He  then goes on to support a diet that is rich in olive oil, alot of olive  oil! For a roasted vegie dish he includes 1/3 of a cup. There is 1/4 cup in  his strawberry spinach salad. Now I have to agree with Dr. Vigilante that  too low fat and no fat are NOT the way to go. I believe a lot of folks  (including myself) may have thought at one time that the lower fat the  better and many of us (me too) may have substituted what we thought were  healthy lofat/nofat foods for fuller fat ones. Unfortunately, some of us  discovered (me again) that we did not lose any weight because we were still  eating to many calories, maybe more. Because instead of having the  satiation fat provides we were eating a ton of sugar. However, I think we  dont need to go overboard on the fat (even the healthy fat) either.  Moderation seems more in order whether it be with sugar or fat such as  olive oil. Though olive oil is a healty fat it still packs a wholloping  14grams of fat per tablespoon and  should also be used in moderation. My  thoughts are to eat a rich varied diet with lots of fibrous carbs, water,  lean proteins, easy on the starches, some good fat and some junk tossed in  now and then. Despite the heavy olive oil if lightened up a bit the recipes  are yummy. And in his book Vigilante also makes the case for a glass of red  wine or grape juice and lists the health benefits in detail something which  is rarely done.g which  is rarely done.	2000-02-03

I purchased both the Bodyflex book and the tapes even though I knew that Greer used to do the HealthRider infomercials. She once claimed that the HealthRider machine was the key to  her fitness, and never mentioned Bodyflex. Now she is claiming deep  breathing is the key to being slim. I decided to try her techniques anyway.  I used the tape for a solid month, not missing one day. I read her book to  make sure I was accurately doing each position.  My family was in hysterics  over her breathing techniques and I have to admit the cheaply made tape was  not impressive. But if it works, so what! But for me it did not work at  all. No inches lost. The bodyflex positions are based on yoga positions. So  naturally they would help one tone up, as would any exercise. However they  are performed in Greer's tape for such a short period of time I feel they  are only likely to help very out of shape individuals. As a regular  exerciser they were not at all beneficial to me. The tape was very short  and despite carefully following her directions, I felt nothing when I  completed the tape. Deep breathing can be very beneficial and the  breathing techniques may help others feel energized and refreshed. I do not  feel deep breathing will help one lose inches though.  I have read that  Greer runs alot and also does not eat after 4pm. I feel that its more  likely that Greer's shape has a lot more to do with her eating and running  habits than a short 10minute breathing routine that she performs daily. At  one time I was on a fitness website and many of the folks tried Greer's  techniques. Though some said the breathing made them feel refreshed, only  one said they felt it helped them get fitter. Isometrics can result in a  toner body and inch loss. Simply contracting body parts like holding in the  abs,(silent sit-up) etc throughout the day can result in a fitter physique.  But you dont need Greer's book to do that.	2000-02-02

The author is shown overweight and slender on the back cover. One caption reads, &quot;Edita before skinny pill&quot;. The other caption reads, &quot;Edita after skinny  pill&quot; Yet the author claims in her previous book &quot;The Fountain of  Youth&quot; that she lost her weight with &quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot;  diet which is different from &quot;The Skinny Pill&quot; plan.  The author  explains in the book how frustrated she feels for women who eat healthy  foods like broccoli and find it turns to fat. Come on Edita, its hard to  believe that most women who eat a healthy diet in moderate portions will  have major weight concerns unless they have a medical problem. Then Edita  claims she had an eureka moment, she realized that you could buy pills to  cure headaches etc. but she wondered where were the pills to make you  skinny &quot;..where was the skinny aisle?&quot; I have seen plenty of  products that claim to make you slim so I am not sure why Edita thought  this was a new concept. Anyway, Edita developed a pill, and an eating plan  she claims will make you slim. I have read about and used many of the  supplements that make up her pill. Though I found her information to be  consistent with other sources I have read, one fact she gives on chitosan  is a bit misleading. In a special box in bold letters, she writes,  &quot;250 mg of chitosan absorbs 1000mg of fat!&quot; Though she makes it  sound like a lot, its not.  1000 mg of fat equals 1 gram of fat which is  only 9 calories. So 250mg chitosan is not really absorbing that many  calories. Though I believe chitosan can effectively be used as a  fatblocker, it needs to be taken according to the amount of fat in what you  are eating. I don't believe the small 250mg dose that is in the pill she  recommends will do a whole lot. Edita also gives a bit of information on  how to increase your fat loss with exercise. However there is not a lot of  detail here. Exercise information is limited to  2 pages. Much more depth  is needed. And Edita could have done that. Unlike her prior book, &quot;The  Fountain of Youth&quot; which is jam-packed with information and detail,  &quot;The Skinny Pill&quot; is a slim volume, with big type and lots of  white space. Its almost like she rushed to get it out. There were mistakes,  I noticed in the book also. The section on fiber, incorrectly listed some  of the soluble and insoluble fibers. I found the eating plan to be very  interesting though. According to Edita fiber rich foods should be eaten in  the am. And proteins should be the focus in the pm. I decided to try this  and though its too early to say for sure it does appear to work for me.  Edita gives simple recipes, but does not give the detail she should. For  example, one recipe calls for a 'large' scoop of ice cream. None of the  recipes give nutritional information, which would be helpful to have. Edita  advises you to take antioxidents along with her &quot;skinny pill&quot; but  here again there is a lack of information on antioxidents themselves and  exactly what to look for when selecting one. Edita describes what is in her  skinny pill. You can make it yourself with ingredients from the health food  store or purchase hers online or from an 800 number. Because I was so  intriqued with her eating plan I felt it only fair to Edita to see if she  could address some of my concerns regarding her book. But alas! I emailed  her at her website 3 times for clarification. My emails were never  responded to. I called her 800 number where they are happy to take your  order but refer all questions to a long distance customer service number. I  called that number several times, an answering machine answered each time  and no one returned my calls. There are also NO RETURNS when you order from  Edita. Supposedly because of the &quot;special prices&quot; which really  dont seem so specail. A 30 day supply of her skinny pill is $35.95 with  shipping! I also find it curious that though Edita claims &quot;The Skinny  Pill&quot; is the way to get skinny she also sells a very different eating  plan &quot;The Fountain of Youth&quot; plan. I noticed that one internet  website had this plan for sale with a product that contained a fat burner  that had all the ingredients of the skinny pill but was called something  else! I would say Edita may be on to something but she leaves lots of  unanswered concerns and a big ? in my mind.ping!

There is a variety of information on a number of different supplements. And there is a plan at the back of the book that claims it will help you reduce  body fat. Though the premise of the book is good, Clouatre failed to make  the book reader friendly. With so many supplements on the market it can be  mind boggling. Clouatre boggles the mind further by jumping from one  supplement to another within the same paragraph. The result is a hodge  podge of facts to sift through. On the plus side though a lot of  information is given. I did question the accuracy on the material given on  DLPA. Clouatre states that the &quot;L&quot; form is effective for appetite  control but not the &quot;D&quot; or the &quot;DL&quot; form. As the  &quot;DL&quot; form includes the &quot;L&quot; form the accuracy of this is  questionable. Other research states that the &quot;DL&quot; form is  effective.  The section on how to apply the information given to reduce  body fat is written in a clearer manner. Clouatre gives tips for bodyfat  loss ie add fiber,exercise etc. Food combining is also recommended. A core  program is also given which includes the use of the described supplements.  Supplements recommended include spirulina, GLA, l-carnitine and many  others. I do feel the book offers much in the way of information, but wish  it was written in a clearer manner.	1999-12-15

The book does offer some good  info. on exercise. It includes information about different forms of  exercise and how to achieve goals utilizing these forms. However it could  have gone into greater depth. On the chapter on weight training for  example, it suggests different sets but does not give any information on  form, technique etc.  The other element missing from this book is  information on diet. The book states &quot;For information on diet check  out the nutrition section at your local bookstore.&quot;  Since diet is at  least 75% of the fat loss game and this book is about fat loss.. something  is missing here. The 62 page book includes lots of the usual &quot;muscle  mag&quot; type poses in black and white, which are inspirational.

In addition though the book  was published in 1999 Rosalie gives examples using the old WW selection  system, not the new 123 Success points system. Since it was so recently  published I feel this should have been updated. On the other hand  regardless of the system used her inspiration as a WW leader for 22 years  is very valuable.	1999-12-02

It would be lovely to play this audiocassette and achieve weight loss &quot;automatically&quot;. But as most of us know it doesnt work like that in the real world. The cassette is ok to listen to, but has a few problems.  Its designed to be used in the car and the authors state this. However,  their voices are so relaxing I found myself having trouble staying awake  when I used the cassette. Secondly, its obvious they are very happy with  each other and they indicate this with comments to one another that really  detract from the point of the cassette. The premise of the cassette is that  feeling good about yourself will help you lose weight and once you feel  good about yourself the weight will come off &quot;automatically&quot; but  then they go on to recommend a 40/30/30 diet! Thus the message of the  cassette isnt quite what its supposed to be.	1999-12-01

Normally I enjoy the offerings of Robert Kennedy (author of &quot;Fast Lane to Fitness&quot;). Despite the cheesy poses of the models pictured in  his books and magazines, his work is motivating! But &quot;Fast Lane to  Fitness&quot; lacks solid information. Unless you are a rank beginner and I  mean rank beginner there is very little information to be gained here.  When I purchased the book I expected info on how to maximize my workout  time effectively to achieve optimal fitness in minimal time. I was  disappointed! Instead this book focuses its few pages (76)on why you should  exercise and the different types you could choose from. There is no in  depth look at how to make true improvement in your physique. The pages are  devoted to simple ideas most third graders know. Sample quote &quot;Jumping  rope is super inexpensive, and can be done at home or on the road (by  taking a jump rope and sweats with you when you travel.) DUH!  Most people  also realize that your diet is at least 70% of the battle. What you eat  will make or break your 'buff' body. But guess how much space is devoted to  nutrition in this book? NONE! Thats right ZIP! Bob, I love your magazine  Oxygen, enjoy some of your other books too..but this one wont get anyone on  the fast lane to fitness...just the fast lane to thinking, Why did I waste  my $$$ on this?&quot;  By the way Bob if you or someone associated with  your magazine Oxygen reads this PLEASE PLEASE relabel those so called  'Special Reports' for Hydroxycut that are frequently published in your mag.  Clearly mark them as 'Advertisements'.	1999-11-17

I read health and nutrition books for pleasure and this was one I could barely get through. It was translated and perhaps thats why it is so hard  to follow. The book skips around and gives little solid information.  Also,if you are looking for information on how to use chitosan as an aid to  weight loss, you will NOT find any information here. The info. on weight  loss is limited to a paragraph and sketchy at best. Maybe chitin-chitosan  is a miracle but you will be hard pressed to understand why in this book.	1999-11-02

This is an eye opening look at Palm Beach society featuring big bucks and big boobs (2 kinds of boobs-silicone and people!) Seriously,Kessler devotes  a whole chapter to the fake breasts that dot the Palm Beach landscape! And  the silly, snobby behavior of some of the locals is described by Kessler in  great detail. The money must grow on palm trees there too. Kessler  describes in depth how the $$$ are made, spent and used as tools to further  &quot;ones position&quot;. And there are lots of $$$ flowing. Kessler  does  tend to focus though on limited areas in Palm Beach. At times I felt as  though I was reading an advertisement for the Palm Beach restaurant Taboo.  Not that it wasnt interesting. I had lunch at Taboo several years ago and  never realized that folks there have been know to pay $500 for twinkies  with cream and leave their panties for the busboy. If I ever get back there  I will certainly be more attentive! I was also surprised to read that  Donald Trump who does not play well in the media often coming across as  self centered and immature actually listens to people and appears  interested in them.(Or did the private flight in &quot;the Donalds&quot;  plane influence Kesslers opinion?) Regardless of what his true character  is, sounds like the Trump is shaking up the Palm Beach area with his gusto  and drive! I am so sorry I did not get a chance to visit Donald's club  while I was there...Sounds gorgeous, if one can afford the dues! It was  also interesting to read that Palm Beach is considered very safe.  Unfortunately I had a bad experience just on the outskirts after dining at  the absolutely exquisite Breakers hotel (which is not mentioned in the book  enough) that has not helped my feelings towards the town despite its great  beauty. The book is gossipy, revealing and definately a juicy read.  I do  wish though that Kessler had explored some other avenues in the town and  not focused primarily on Taboo and just a few other places. Overall though  a nice, light read. Perfect for the pool! (Oh you say its winter where you  are? Well why aren't you flying to one of your other homes for the  season?!)a nice, light read. Perfect for the pool! (Oh you say its winter where you  are?

Rarely do you come across a cookbook like this! Dr.Chud's &quot;prescription&quot; is &quot;Eat as though your life depends on it.&quot; Based on growing evidence that insulin plays a major role in fat  storage, metabolism and appetite, Dr. Chud supports an  &quot;insulin-modulating&quot; way of eating. For her book &quot;The  Gourmet Prescription&quot; she has created a number of recipes that reflect  her philosophy. She invites you into her kitchen and leads you step by step  into creating wonderful, flavorful dishes! The photographs are  mouthwatering in their appeal and the variety of foods presented  impressive. You feel like you are actually in the kitchen with the author  as she shares her  thoughts on nutrition and how to maximize flavor using  simple techniques and tools. Her heart and soul jump through the pages!  As  a result of using this book I have discovered new vegetables, cooking  techniques etc. The smoked shrimp &quot;fajitas&quot; are a new family  favorite. The chicken kebabs with spicy lime sauce are declicious  especially when pared with the black bean salad with avocado! Everything I  prepared was wonderful and there are so many other recipes that I look  forward to trying!  I did wish that a glycemic index for foods and  a  resource guide for some of the lesser known ingredients was included. Dr.  Chud does include a nutritional analysis for each dish.  She uses a  stovetop smoker in some of her dishes. I substituted a wok and it worked  great. This is a cookbook that delivers what it promises!	1999-10-02

Thats not enough for a healthy individual to consume. She also says no to fats like nuts. A few nuts now and again may be fatty but fat provides satiation and  nuts provide the &quot;good&quot; fat our body needs.  This is not a  healthy diet for anyone and I would think that those who did manage to  follow it would regain quickly any weight that they lost. Thumbs down on  this book!	1999-09-07

The &quot;diet&quot; is very dated.  On page 7 the authors  state, &quot;For once the experts on health are nearly unanimous. Most  agree that the food we eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner and for those in  between snacks should be low in fat and high in carbohydrate.&quot; What  experts are they referring to? The majority of new information points to  the low fat, high carbohydrate way of eating (that they propose) as a means  to GET FATTER!!! When we eat too low fat we tend to substitute with sugar  as we are not satisfied.  The authors propose high carb dining. Yet adding  protein to your snacks and meals can help control your appetite. They are  proposing the SAME old diet (low fat, high carb)that made many of us  fatter. I think the rules for true weight loss are lifestyle changes...ie  eat unprocessed foods, lots of water, limited starchy carbs,  some protein  at each meal and some good fat in your diet for satiation.  This book takes  all we have learned in the past few years (as we got fatter eating low fat,  high carb and too much sugar)and blows it off!	1999-09-07
US	52362855	R1KDPN1Q9QVZ42	0670885932	565075804	The Diet Cure: The 8-Step Program to Rebalance Your Body Chemistry and End Food Cravings, Weight Problems, and Mood-Swings--Now	Books	5	45	48	N	N	Wonderful book packed with helpful information!	I love this book! It is not your usual &quot;diet&quot; tome. For most folks, trying to eat healthy can be tough. Cravings are hard to overcome. In this book Julia Ross describes how to use supplements to help control  your cravings. As you read through the book, you identify your problems ie  blood sugar imbalances, sluggish thyroid etc. and then follow the  supplementation she suggests to rectify the problem. There is alot of  information here that I have not found anywhere else. However it is not an  easy read. It takes a lot of time and effort to plan your program,  especially since she &quot;jumps&quot; around alot in the text. I also feel  she could have been more specific about a few issues regarding the amino  acids. For example if you have more than one problem is it safe to combine  all the amino acids listed and at what doseage?  The back section with  information on what to eat for health could have been beefed up more also.  Still I gave this book 5 stars because the information in it has been so  useful!!	1999-09-05
US	52362855	RO1BBEYTXR4AM	0312171021	208866881	The Fat Blocker Diet: The Revolutionary Discovery That Removes Fat Naturally	Books	2	26	27	N	N	An out of date diet centered around a &quot;wonder&quot; supplement	This book is a diet centered around the food supplement chitosan.  According to the author research has shown that chitosan when added to the  diet blocks fat absorbtion thus you can eliminate fat calories using the  product.  I had read about chitosan on the web and wanted additonal  concrete information which was sadly lacking in this book. The authors  spend a lot of time discussing many &quot;diet&quot; topics such as why  excess fat is bad, why other diets dont work, why exercise is important but  very little information is given on chitosan itself. Though chitosan may  very well be a revolutionary product for fat control you will barely learn  the essentials about it with this text. For example he tells you how many  grams of chitosan to take prior to eating certain items.  Most chitosan is  sold in milligrams so this will be confusing for some.  He tells you not to  take a surplus of the product but does not really explain why.  He fails to  explain the difference between food grade and pharmaceutical grade chitosan  and the dosages to take of each. He does not mention how to use ascorbic  acid to increase its potency. He does not list sources or what to look for  when purchasing chitosan.  The diet itself appears to be based on the food  pyramid alone and is old fashioned in that it does not allow for individual  differences.  Some people following a 70% carbohydrate diet for example  will not loose weight needing more protein. He also commits the sin of not  including an index at the back.  I feel all factual books should include  that for easy reference and anyone who does not include one is making it  easy on themselves and not writing a true reference book. On the plus side  at least he helps draw chitosan to the publics attention.	1998-10-09
