Somewhat reminiscent of Virginia Woolf's masterpiece \\"Mrs. Dalloway,\\" this novel takes a day-in-the-life look at one man, Henry Perowne, as he goes through a Saturday in February, the day of the largest anti-war march in UK history, with an undercurrent of pending dread. McEwan's narrative hooks you in from page one and doesn't let up until you've turned the final page. Expertly captures the paranoia and fear that have affected us all and has become a part of life since September 11.  <br /> <br />A tour-de-force.	2005-04-26

It moves quickly and keeps you turning pages. You may even laugh out loud on occasion and be reminded of similar situations/characters from your college days. <br /> <br />Is this good literature? No. The book has too many faults to be considered \\"quality fiction.\\" It is sub-par Tom Wolfe ... though sub-par Tom Wolfe is better than most of the drivel that gets published these days. Still, after following the trials and tribulations of our heroine for 700 pages, you wish the payoff at the end was better, which leaves the reader feeling gyped and pretty annoyed.  <br /> <br />Tom does a good job evoking campus life, though (and it's been a while since I've been in a university environment) it reads a bit extreme.  <br /> <br />The book though suffers most from lack of editing. Whole sections are overwritten (almost embarrassingly so) and extremely repetitive. The book would have benefited were it half as long.  <br /> <br />At any rate, I enjoyed it as I read it, but by its ending, I found myself asking why I'd bothered.	2005-03-21

Told through the eyes of a nine year-old child, The Plot Against America is an oftentimes horrific account of what might have happened had Charles Lindbergh, celebrity pilot and rabid anti-Semite, beaten FDR in the 1940 presidential election.

The story is told through the perspective of young John Milk, a student at Indiana University who goes on to become one of Kinsey's research assistants.  <br /> <br />The narrative voice is strong, often compelling, particularly in its depiction of the ambivalent sexuality of its central characters, propelled by Kinsey himself, but the long-expected, somewhat inevitable denouement (which should pack an emotional punch) somehow manages to fall short and the story wraps up a little too tidily. <br /> <br />Still, this is an entertaining read and a worthy introduction to TC Boyle, whose works I had never read. \\"Drop City,\\" which I imagine to be a superior book to this, is next on my list.  <br /> <br />	2004-11-01

He writes with such a fluid narrative style and shows such a compassion for his characters -- even at their worst and most selfish -- that all of them (even the supporting ones) are fully realized and utterly real.  <br /> <br />This is a story about family -- both traditional and non-traditional -- and how home is really where you make it.

You keep turning the pages in hopes that some sort of narrative thread will be picked up, only to discover by book's end that you're more-or-less right back where you started with little illumination, and you'll be hard-pressed an hour later to even remember the characters' names.<br />Still, Garland is a talented writer and I will keep buying his books in hopes that the next one will achieve the same literary heights as his debut.	2004-07-07

Sedaris is an amazing wit and his ability to pare down a situation - none of which are all that significant in and of themselves, but all of which any reader can relate to - into its essential elements for the purposes of commentary and observation, is second to none. <br />A superb collection from a master.	2004-07-07

Seierstad allows her characters to speak for themselves in that she relates the stories of the Khan family in a narrative format of which she is not a prevalent part, and therefore expresses no personal opinion. <br />It is an expose of a brutal male-dominated society where even after the fall of the Taliban, women are held in bondage within the confines of their own homes - some reduced to the role of servants depending on their age and position in the household, others are sold off as little more than slaves, all are physically and verbally abused, and in some cases killed. <br />&quot;The Bookseller of Kabul&quot; is not, I believe, meant to provoke sympathy in the hearts of its readers, nor are we expected to &quot;like&quot; or &quot;identify&quot; with the people it portrays. What it does is provide us, the Western reader, with a slice of life in a world most of us will never experience. Despite a decade-plus of invasion, war, and revolution, it's amazing to me that any form of life is sustained here at all. <br />The descriptions are vivid - particularly of young Mansur's &quot;pilgramage&quot; to Mazar-i-Sharif and the vast topography of Afghanistan itself. <br />As such, this book serves as an effective complement to the more traditional journalistic coverage of the war in Afghanistan and its people.	2004-02-16

For what it is, I enjoyed it. I liked the characters of Moiraine and Siuan and it is certainly a refreshing change to read more fully developed female characters in the fantasy genre. The story itself was rather pedestrian but it held my interest through 300 pages. I did find Jordan's narrative style rather clunky, though, and felt it oftentimes came across like it had been translated rather badly from another language. I don't know though whether this is indicative of his writing overall.<br />Not bad, not great. Do I want to read more? Sure, but not for a while.	2004-02-10

It held my interest and even made me laugh out loud on a number of occasions, but great literature this is not. I didn't really even see it as all that scathing an indictment of American society, at least not in terms of it breaking new ground. If an American had written the book, I'm sure there would have been less uproar. <br />The characters are over-the-top Texan stereotypes, none of them fleshed out, and the plot is pedestrian at best. Still, Vernon as narrator has an engaging voice and manages to evoke a certain dread regarding the outcome of the events described.	2003-11-24

Madonna's first outing as a children's author isn't great, but it's pretty darn good. The narrative voice and story are pure Madonna (albeit in her British mode) and the story is one children young and old can relate to. The illustrations are colorful and eyecatching, but a little too busy for my tastes. I much prefer the illustrations in \\"Mr. Peabody's Apples,\\" Madonna's follow-up. Still and all, this is an attractive package and a worthwhile addition to any child's (or grown-up child's) collection.<br />Overall, a credible and very promising start to Madonna's new persona as author.	2003-11-24

While most will be drawn to read this book because of the insights Ms. Albright provides into the Clinton Administration's roles in the Middle East conflict, Kosovo, and North Korea - all of which are discussed in fascinating detail - some of the most compelling (and poignant) sections of the book have to do with her pain associated with the sudden dissolution of her marriage, the discovery of her Jewish ancestry, and her life in Czechoslovakia as a young girl.<br />Ms. Albright's narrative voice is warm and inviting and utterly without pretension. This is my vote for the best non-fiction book of 2003.	2003-11-10

I was intrigued by the reviews I read, both equally praising and damning of it. Amis's latest is indeed a page turner...but that doesn't qualify it as a good book. In fact, this is one of the worst, most incoherent books I've read in a long time...if not ever. I'm not usually one to completely slam a book. I can usually find at least one constructive thing to say about it. I can't here.<br />Yellow Dog is a real dog of a book. It reads more like an exercise in shock value than a novel. It barely kept me entertained the plane ride back (word of caution: not a good idea to read a book on a plane that features an extended airplane crash sequence, but what did I know?) Still, I did manage to read it straight through in one eight hour sitting. I suppose that counts for something.<br />Amis is a good writer, at least he's proven himself to be with such earlier efforts as &quot;Money.&quot; Don't give this dog a bone.

This is the very sad depiction of an aristocratic family's decline and fall in the years between the two world wars. It is one of those rare novels where the reader doesn't necessarily have to like any of the characters to be moved by them. Through the brittle and rather unsympathetic narration of Charles Ryder, the reader is given glimpses of a world sundered by the hypocrisies of sex, religion, and class and the impending cataclysm of World War Two. We come to know the Marchmain family without really knowing them, much as Charles - an outsider himself - does. Still, this does not deflect from our sympathy for Sebastian's alcoholic devolution or the repressed misery of the tragically beautiful Julia. <br />Read the book and then rent the splendid - and faithful - BBC adaptation starring a young Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews, and Diana Quick. Both novel and film will haunt you.	2003-10-05

Although anecdotal in its narrative structure, the sum of each part adds up to a satisfying - and quite surprising - whole. The book requires patience and, as several readers here have remarked, is best read in one or two chapter sittings. This is certainly one of the best American novels of the past ten years. <br />Anthony Minghella's got a terrific cast and crew behind the upcoming and eagerly anticipated film version.

It is stark, bold, and wholly unsentimental. But then things start to slide. James' parents visit him at the clinic where the reader is treated to page after page of sentimentalized touchy-feely \\"you don't understand my feelings\\" psychobabble that reads like an Afterschool Special, albeit with an edge.

For whatever reason, it just wasn't holding my interest. The story was only vaguely interesting and it went along at a rather mundane pace. But then, just when I thought I'd given up, something happened. The story started coming together, the characters and setting grew on me, and I discovered much to my pleasant surprise that I couldn't put it down. I raced to finish it and had to force myself not to glance down to the bottom of the next page to find out what was coming next.<br />This is a story of secrets and lies set in a tiny English village in the heart of World War Two. An innocent child's game of &quot;spies&quot; turns into an ugly and inevitably tragic tale of wartime recriminations and unrequited love with an ending to rival the surprising and equally devastating denouement of Ian McEwan's &quot;Atonement.&quot; <br />Frayn's brilliance is subtle and exists mostly within the seemingly innocent yet insightful observations of his child narrator, Stephen Wheatley, through whose eyes the reader experiences the story.<br />I'm glad I persevered!	2003-06-12

At twenty-eight, billionaire playboy Eric Packer reminds me of the anti-heroes of Brett Easton Ellis novels: coolly amoral he gets his comeuppance in the end. It's not much of a novel - and as for the \\"statement\\" about the shallow inanities of materialistic pursuit that Delillo seems to be making, it's all been said before - but with that said I kept turning the pages and there are a couple set pieces that, while not necessarily inspired, are well-conceived - particularly the anti-globalization riot that forms the centerpiece of the narrative and the opening pages that introduce the reader to Packer's impossibly decked-out limousine. This limo alone is worth the price of admission.<br />There's a cinematic quality to the proceedings. At times, this reads more like a screenplay than a novel. The dialogue is brisk and Mamet-esque though from time to time it comes off stilted. <br />All in all, not a bad way to knock off a few hours' reading, but don't expect to be wowed or pondering hidden depths days later.<br />I can see Christian Bale now...	2003-06-02

I'm really pleased that I did.<br />After a somewhat slow start, the book gains momentum and it's full speed ahead through to its thrilling finale. Sharpe is one of those characters that appeals to both men and women - he's a swashbuckling action hero with a sexy sort of charm. The novel is steeped in vivid depictions of battle, historical milieu, and a colorful cast of characters that includes one of the most dastardly villains I've come across in several years. Certainly not for the faint of heart, Cornwell's descriptions of battle carnage are brutal.<br />I look forward to picking up the next installment. Great summer reading!	2003-05-12

The reader is able to feel, smell, and even taste the desert sand, the relentless heat, the decomposed corpses of Iraqi soldiers...<br />But for all this, I found Swofford's narrative somewhat lacking. I was expecting to be moved by his experiences and his reflections upon the morality of wartime. Instead I found myself turning pages quickly but with very little actual contemplation over what I was reading. And by the time the war ends and Swofford is on his journey home, I realized that I, as the reader, was underwhelmed at least in comparison to other books I've read of this genre. <br />Still, Swofford is a fine writer and I look forward to reading his next book. And I give \\"Jarhead\\" a recommendation because it does capture its setting and scene and introduces the literary world to an emerging new talent.	2003-04-14

I found sections of this novel extremely compelling: the World War Two diaries, the New York diary, and parts of the diaries devoted to his life and education at Oxford in the 1920s. Other sections I found rather ponderous, particularly the latter sections set in Nigeria and France. Since this book is structured in the form of a diary, it lacks the forward narrative drive of a good novel. This isn't necessarily problematic but, to this reader anyway, the book drags toward the end where a novel should be building to its dramatic peak. Still, however, Boyd succeeds in conveying the sense of disillusionment and sadness of growing old and wondering &quot;is that all there is?&quot;<br />Perhaps Boyd's greatest success here is the way he manages to recreate time and place. These &quot;diaries&quot; feel very real and each page comes alive with authenticity.<br />If you're looking for an introduction to William Boyd, better start with an earlier novel of his &quot;The Ice Cream War.&quot; For all its merits, &quot;Any Human Heart&quot; is an acquired taste. It requires patience in long stretches, but overall, the effort does reap some rewards.	2003-03-31

I enjoyed the film but felt like something was missing in the translation. However, I can comment on &quot;Middlesex&quot; on its own terms and with that said, I found it to be a distinctive piece of fiction, endlessly entertaining, and profoundly moving for long stretches - particularly the final third that deals with Calliope's anguished, but ultimately triumphant, adolescence.<br />The cast of characters is colorful, the settings varied, and its sense of historical place and time quite vivid, especially in its depiction of the Detroit riots and burning of the city in the late-60s. But it's the character of Calliope (or &quot;Cal&quot;) that really holds it all together. I found myself caring more for her than for any character I can recall in recent fiction. Her transformation - both figurative and literal - is beautifully rendered.<br />My only criticism is of the interludes that appear intermittently set in 2002 Berlin, which depict the narrator's relationship with an Asian-American woman. These sections - never more than seven or eight pages at a time - read like fragments from a different novel or sections that had been edited out of the final text. <br />It's a long book, but one well worth the effort.	2003-02-20
US	51322863	R2DDF154VAKUNF	0375758771	197783362	The Glass Palace: A Novel	Books	4	2	2	N	N	A worthwhile story well told	Amitav Ghosh's novel is a multi-generational saga chronicling the interconnected lives and fortunes of two families -- one Indian, the other Burmese -- set against the backdrop of British colonial rule and, finally, the rise of the Indian independence movement in the midst World War Two. Ghosh paints a stunning panorama, providing the reader with a compelling story, interesting characters, and a concise introduction to the late 19th/early 20th century history of the region. He is most successful when portraying the conflicting loyalties of a generation that, having grown up under colonial rule, must face the end of a way of life they have always known and the emergence of something entirely different that goes against everything they have ever been taught to believe. <br />My only real criticism -- if it can be called that -- is a difficulty, at least on the part of this reader, in keeping straight the familial relationships of the novel's middle generation (and by far the novel's biggest focus.) I wish a family tree had been included in the front matter.<br />Overall, however, a triumph of its genre.	2003-01-22
US	51322863	R11LXMDHZFQXOI	0375422412	120680919	Three Junes	Books	3	22	27	N	N	Not bad, but not particularly memorable either	Three Junes tells the story of a Scottish family in the aftermath of the mother's death, but mostly it deals with the life of Fenno, the eldest of three brothers, who lives in New York and runs an eclectic bookstore in the Village. Fenno becomes the caretaker of a music critic dying of AIDS and the on-again-off-again lover of a photographer unwilling to allow himself to be pinned down.<br />Like so many books these days that pick up prestigious awards, this book is well-written, the characters are finely drawn (particularly Fenno, who serves as the narrator for the second and, by far, biggest chunk of the novel), but I was left rather non-plussed. A year from now, I'll probably look back on this novel and will remember enjoying it, but won't be able to remember much beyond that. While I wasn't disappointed, per se, I wasn't overly impressed. Julia Glass is a decent writer, but there's nothing particularly memorable about her style or her narrative voice. At times, this novel reminded me of something Maeve Binchy might write. There have been several great novels published of late, I'm surprised this was chosen as the National Book Award winner.<br />Again, there's nothing really wrong here.  Three Junes is a pleasant diversion, but not much beyond that.	2003-01-01

However, I think I fall somewhere in between. I was enthralled by \\"Less Than Zero\\" when I read it in high school back in '85, was tormented by \\"American Psycho\\" -- both by its brilliance and audacity -- couldn't get through the first 100 pages of \\"Glamorama\\", and \\"Rules of Attraction\\"? -- I grew to love the characters over time as I find myself relating to them more than I ever thought I would. <br />Savagely funny but incredibly sad, on its surface, \\"The Rules of Attraction\\" may not seem like it has a lot to say, but by the end of it, the reader (at least this reader) was left exhilarated and depressed by how much I liked these characters despite their apparent lack of any redeeming qualities and moral vacuity. <br />Ellis' writing is alternately laugh-out-loud funny, barbed, and subtly poignant. He never hits you over the head. I was disappointed, though, by the last thirty or so pages, which felt like Ellis was running out of steam. But nonetheless, this ranks as one of his best.<br />...and despite the bad reviews, the recent film version is extremely well done in its own right, though the screenwriter takes certain liberties with time and sequence of plot. James van der Beek plays a great Sean Bateman. Worth seeing.	2002-10-26

Coetzee's &quot;autobiography&quot; is a wonderful introduction to the writer if you aren't familiar with him (as I wasn't). His prose style is spare but descriptive, and conveys South Africa in the late '40s and early '50s as seen through the eyes of a child. Not big on &quot;plot,&quot; but based more upon observation, Boyhood is a quiet triumph.	2002-09-18

Given its rhapsodic critical reception, I was expecting a quick and absorbing read. Instead I found myself slogging through page after page with only moments of fleeting interest, hoping that it would all come together to a satisfying, or at least thought-provoking finale. After 300+ pages, I was left disappointed.<br />I think my main problem is with the fact that this book has been compared to the works of F.Scott Fitzgerald and various other writers who came out of the 1920s and collectively represented the voice of a lost generation. This is simply not an accurate or responsible comparison. Fitzgerald's characters are survivors of the cataclysm of World War One, an event of unparalleled devastation on both physical and psychological levels. If Fitzgerald's characters are bitter, nihilistic, or self-serving it is because <BR>of the history they have survived and the losses they have experienced.  The characters in &quot;Prague&quot; have undergone nothing of equal power. The fall of communism does not really affect any of them directly, with the exception perhaps of Imre Horvath, the Hungarian publisher whose story more-or-less forms the backbone of what little narrative momentum the book has. Phillips' characters, on the other hand, come across as little more than spoiled, over-privileged brats with very little to say about anything. They're a bunch of posers mostly, all surface and no depth...which may be Phillips' point, but it certainly doesn't make for very stimulating reading. Overall, the book feels half-developed: characters emerge and then disappear halfway with little or no explanation, and the second half really doesn't come together but feels more a patched-together series of loosely connected vignettes.<br />The best thing the book has going for it is its sense of atmosphere, particularly in the nightclub scenes with Nadja, the mysterious aging pianist, and in the few scenes that evoke Budapest's emerging art world circa 1990.<br />I'm frustrated because this book could have been so much better and promises a helluva lot more than it actually delivers.<br />Not recommended despite the critical hoopla.	2002-09-03

No, this is not John Grisham and yes, the plot meanders a bit and no, the ending is not as satisfying as I had hoped. But after over six hundred pages, Carter succeeds in creating a central character &quot;Talcott&quot; the reader can honestly root for as well as a host of other characters that are utterly sympathetic, or if not sympathetic, then wholly believable. To a certain extent, Stephen Carter does for the African American New Haven/D.C./Martha's Vineyard community what Tom Wolfe has done for New York and Atlanta: he presents not just a cast of interesting but disparate characters, but a living/breathing cross-section of society.<br />Intelligent, thought-provoking, and one of my picks for 2002's top novels.	2002-08-19

It owes much of its success to its concentration on life ... in essence, it serves as a celebration of the very human lives of the firemen at 40/35: portraying them as they were to their families, friends, and loved ones, as well as to each other within the house. Even though it culminates and is predicated on tragedy, Halberstam's book leaves its readers moved, saddened certainly, but more than a little uplifted. It proves that in a world full of so much evil, there is a lot that is good.	2002-07-18

US	51322863	R1M3PE4CJL9CKH	052594642X	838675611	The Impressionist	Books	4	5	5	N	N	An impressive debut	Kunzru's debut is remarkable in many ways: his prose is rich in color and description, every setting his describes - whether it be a flood-ravaged plain in India, the slums of Bombay, the streets of Oxford, or the deserts of Africa - come sensuously alive, and the plot keeps the reader eagerly turning pages even if at times it becomes a little implausible. The book's protagonist, Pranath, resembles an Anglo-Indian version of Patricia Highsmith's &quot;Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; in his seemingly effortless ability to morph from one persona to another, all the while serving the author's intent of reflecting upon the ambiguities of British colonialism in India, Africa, and England itself.<br />I found Kunzru's prose better served the conveying of setting and local color than providing a basis for three-dimensional characters. Pranath still remains somewhat unknowable at the end of 300 pages and the supporting cast, while colorful and richly drawn in their own right, never quite connects with the reader on an emotional level. <br />Still, this is an exciting debut and one well worth reading.	2002-07-02

It is perhaps one of the most haunting and beautifully-crafted novels of the past fifty years with an ending that lingers and affects long after you've turned the final page.<br />Each of the novel's four parts is meticulously crafted. McEwan is a very descriptive writer - particularly in the extended first chapter - but he is not one to waste words. He builds his characters slowly, weaving a subtly etched plot to a quiet but devastating effect.<br />This is a novel to treasure and be read again and again.	2002-04-24

I came away disturbed and baffled more than anything else ... and slightly nauseous.<br />Wagner certainly is a prodigious talent. His dialogue flies off the page, and his characters, though a rather unlikeable lot, manage to convey a certain pathos that is truly revealing. I might even venture to say I was surprisingly moved by the ending. Unfortunately, though, Wagner comes off as a more impressive stylist than storyteller. As a result, the narrative tends to drift and gets lost amid virtuoustic and occasionally tangential verbiage. One particular complaint is that I often lost track of the characters themselves and how they were inter-related.<br />This is not - and I repeat NOT - a novel for everyone. It requires a strong stomach and an open mind. Some of Wagner's descriptions border on the pornographic, and occasionally seem to push the envelope just for the sake of shock value. <br />Still, there is quite a bit to admire here, and if one can get past the fact that these characters are - for the most part - utterly unredeemable, and the plot a bit unfocused, you are in for quite a read.	2002-01-31

While Faulks's attention to period detail is, as ever, right on the money - New York's Greenwich Village during the Beat era is evocatively rendered - and his writing at times utterly gorgeous, the story, about a British diplomat's wife and her affair with a New York newspaper journalist, only takes off in sporadic bursts. The character of Mary is sympathetic, but the reader feels more an observer of the events unfolding than an actual participant in them, despite heavy use of interior monologue and flashback. Her husband Charles,again, is sympathetic but not particularly developed. Faulks's most successful character here is Frank, the American journalist with whom Mary falls in love. He just feels right, completely representative of New York City in that place and time. <br />With all that said, however, I did find the final third of the novel quite moving when Mary must make the inevitable choice between her husband and her lover. <br />Recommended reading ... just with some reservations.	2002-01-29

On this level, Gao provides a fascinating study. The book reads more as a piece of non-fiction travel essay than straight fiction as the author recounts his wanderings through rural China after a misdiagnosis of terminal illness and a run-in with the Chinese communist bureaucracy.<br />Where the book falters are in the chapters devoted to \\"You\\" and \\"She\\", ostensibly the narrator's alter egos. What I believe is meant to be a dialogue about sex and male/female relationships, while interesting at first, becomes tiresome and trite, as though the author is trying really hard to be profound while not really breaking any new ground.<br />On the whole, an interesting, though ultimately disappointing read, which is a shame because I'd heard such good things.	2002-01-22

Better in the sense that Tolkien's language is so rich and his descriptions of Middle Earth and his characters so vivid that these are virtually impossible to capture in full in the film-makers medium. With that said, however, I think Peter Jackson's film is a phenomenal piece of work and probably as true to Tolkien's vision as possible.<br />I am not a fan of fantasy fiction, but this book (the Lord of the Rings, that is, of which this is just a piece) transcends the genre to rank as one of the 20th century's greatest works of literature in English language. Give it a few pages, and then be prepared to be swept up in a world utterly unlike our own, and yet, particularly in light of what's going on in the world today, so chillingly similar.<br />Fantastic - almost prophetic - stuff.	2002-01-01

It tells the fairly ho-hum story of a twentysomething Shanghai woman, Coco, who divides her time between two lovers - the childish and heroin-addicted Tian Tian, and Mark, the golden-haired German - while philosophizing about love, art, the writing process, and life in a city that seems as divided between East and West as the narrator herself. <br />The carefree and dangerously reckless lifestyles of Coco, Tian Tian, Mark, Madonna (no, not THE Madonna), and a handful of their friends and acquaintances is familiar territory to anyone who's read the works of Jay McInerney and Brett Easton Ellis. What makes this book a better-than-average read is the portrayal it gives of the city of Shanghai itself, ie it reads very Western, which is probably what made the Chinese establishment so hot under the collar. <br />Wei Hui writes with an assured voice (albeit here in translation) and the story she tells is enlightening only for the fact that it is written about Chinese characters in a Chinese city. What it ultimately reveals is that there really isn't much difference between the beautiful people of New York, L.A., or London and those of Shanghai or Beijing. Is this surprising? No, not really ... but it does make for a change of pace.	2001-11-26

I love history - particularly World War Two - so I was excited to read Ambrose's  book, particularly in light of the HBO miniseries. For the first 150 or so pages, I found the book compelling not just as history but as a vivid account of the human spirit and resiliency under extreme conditions.  Unfortunately, my interest started to wane at the halfway point as Ambrose lays on thick the American patriotic chest-thumping.  While America certainly helped bring WW2 to a close, this book portrays the British as a bunch of disorganized . (A common characteristic I've found in American literature written about the era.) The British withstood the Nazis for two years before America came in.  To portray them as anything less than heroes does them a severe disservice  and fatally taints what should have been an enlightening read. <br />Based on the first two episodes of HBO's miniseries adaptation, in this case, I recommend skipping the book in favor of the movie where, rather ironically, the role of Winters, unquestionably Easy Company's most stalwart hero, is brilliantly played by a Brit.	2001-09-14

The text is very readable and concisely written.  The photographs alone speak volumes and the maps provide a nice illustrative point of reference.<br />Before you read any other POW-related book, take the time to read &quot;Honor Bound&quot; cover to cover.  Not only will you feel you are getting to know these men - heroes all - personally, you will gain a brutally clear perception of the conditions these men were forced to endure and the way they managed to maintain their honor and dignity in the face of such terrible adversity. The human element is very strong.<br />This is not, mind you, a book for the weak-stomached. The book is unflinching in its cataloging of the various tortures the POWs underwent, the often rancid food they were forced to subsist on, and the day to day challenges their captors and the climate inflicted upon them.<br />Surprisingly, however, while the reader is horrified, he or she will leave the book strangely uplifted.  It reaffirms one's faith in the human spirit and humanity in general.	2001-08-31

Patrick Wallingford makes for an amusing anti-hero, a well-intentioned lothario who comes to find love in the aftermath of a horrible (though comically rendered) &quot;accident&quot;. Aside from some laugh out loud moments, there really isn't much here but an amiable narrative that continues along to its fairly predictable conclusion. Characterization, usually one of Irving's hallmarks, isn't in over-abundance here. Doris Clausen is likeable in contrast to the novel's other female characters who are portrayed as either shrill harpies, lonely middle-aged women, gum-smacking bimbos from Queens, or buxom Amazonian sex kittens ... all more-or-less sex obsessed. (Think Philip Roth, though without his significance.) Irving weaves this all together with a seeming running commentary on the degraded status of American television journalism. The commentary is there but it isn't particularly noteworthy or profound. Still, I was entertained and kept turning the pages, though for a novelist as celebrated (deservedly) as Irving, this is poor praise indeed.	2001-08-27

Throw in a slightly forboding priest who seems able to read souls, a homeless street musician, a motley crew of assorted eccentrics and wannabes, and an historic apartment building, you have a terrific and at times strangely poignant read.<br />The collection holds together nicely.  The characters, even those somewhat relegated to the background as the Patrick-James-Rally story takes the forefront, are finely etched and memorable in their own right.  Schickler is a master of conveying gobs about his characters without resorting to overly dramatic descriptions or dialogue.  At times this approach comes across as a bit simplistic but it still manages to be quite effective.  My only real criticism is of the development of the collection's climax.  While it is exciting, at least to this reader, it came across as rather forced.  The final scene, however, is remarkably understated and renders a nice impact.<br />All in all, this is a good weekend's read.  Schickler is definitely a writer to watch.	2001-08-20

The plot gets even more complex and the theological debate rages as Pullman keeps us turning pages to find out what exactly will come of this epic battle of good vs. evil, played out over multiple worlds and parallel realties - though it is never as clearly defined as that.  <br />The ambiguities are enormous and the reader will keep guessing to the very last page.  What is Mrs. Coulter's true motivation? Is Lord Asriel really a fallen angel, as his name suggests? Will Lyra ever be reunited with her friend Roger? Does Will ever see his mother again ... is he reunited with his father? And again, what exactly is Dust and how does it fit into our heroes'lives? The questions don't relent ... and the answers, when all is revealed, may still leave the reader puzzled. But that is the brilliance of this work. Nothing is cut and dried.  How many works of contemporary fiction linger with you long after you've put them down?<br />One of the most exciting things about this trilogy is the way in which both Will and Lyra, in particular, grow and mature.  Pullman's handling of their 'growing up' is delicate and finely rendered.  Their final scenes together are wrenching ... as is the sequence in the Land of the Dead that serves as the novel's centerpiece. This is perhaps one of the most chilling passages I've encountered in recent fiction.<br />I can't wait to read it again.	2001-08-16

Reality and fantasy seamlessly interweave in this depiction of a boy's childhood in pre-Castro Cuba.  I am having a difficult time putting into words my experience with this novel.  Arenas's prose is gorgeous, poetic in its lyricism, crossing into a style that reads like a fusion between Walt Whitman and James Joyce, reminiscent of the latter particularly in the novel's final section, a mad and hallucinatory set piece that takes place during Christmas and is written completely as dialogue.  There is much abuse - both physical and psychological - to be endured in these pages, yet through it all Arenas maintains a strangely uplifting tone.  His descriptions of nature are stunning in their simplicity and detail, as is the relationship between the young narrator and his mother that provides the through-line around which the action of the novel centers.<br />By its end, the reader is left moved and exhilarated, yet painfully aware that life for this boy and his mother really isn't going to get much better ... and, if we are to read the narrator as Reinaldo Arenas himself, in fact, will get much much worse.<br />I was frequently reminded of Julian Schnabel's film of Arenas's memoir &quot;Before Night Falls&quot;, particularly of the early childhood scenes at the beginning of the film.  If you haven't seen it, it serves as an excellent introduction to the life of this amazing artist.  If you have seen it, the film stands to be viewed again.	2001-08-01

There's a whole lot going on here - layer upon layer of plot, character, symbolism, worlds within worlds within worlds, and a deeply religious subtext.  A new protagonist is introduced - the young boy Will - who serves as a counterpart to Lyra, upon which the first novel &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; centered.  I found Will to be an even more compelling character than Lyra and the two of them together provide a very strong and utterly sympathetic and at times poignant center. <br />The menace that was hinted at in The Golden Compass takes deeper root here (and some of it is quite horrible), as do the Biblical settings and theme.  Pullman seems to be creating a battle between morality and evil akin to Milton's Paradise Lost.  <br />Some secrets and truths are revealed yet even more is shrouded in mystery. By novel's end you will be desperate to pick up the trilogy's final volume, &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;. <br />Pullman is quite a writer.	2001-06-26

For that, you're better off picking up a copy of &quot;American Pastoral&quot;. What works here is the sheer audacity of Roth's style and the effortless flow of his narrative.<br />&quot;The Breast&quot; is the first in a trilogy completed by the recently published &quot;The Dying Animal&quot;.  Professor of comparative literature David Kepesh wakes up one day to discover himself in the hospital, having been transformed into a 155-pound female breast.  The ensuing 89 pages depict his rationalization for such a sudden and drastic change, his trying to convince himself and others - his girlfriend, his father, his doctor, and a university mentor - that he has only gone insane, and his quest to satiate an ever-present, raging libido.<br />None of this really amounts to much and it certainly isn't great literature.  I kept expecting it all to come to some elevated meaning.  It doesn't.  But that aside, I did enjoy reading it, found myself cracking a grin or two, and as ever with Roth, I was in awe of the flow of his narrative and the strength of his voice.<br />It's an hour or two's diversion but by no means much more than that.  Bottom line - not bad, but not earth-shakingly good.  For that, crack open &quot;American Pastoral&quot;, which is in my opinion one of the greatest American novels of the 2nd half of the 20th century.	2001-05-27

I'd been told that if I liked the Harry Potter series, I would like this even more.  It took me several weeks to get through the first 150 pages ... usually not a good sign.  But then, something clicked and I devoured the last half of the novel in a matter of a couple sittings.  <br />The darkness pulls you in. You read and you can't quite figure out what's going on but you know that something nasty is definitely afoot, you're just not sure what.  What in heck are the daemons and why does everyone have one? What is Dust? What's the deal with Mrs. Coulter and that creepy golden monkey of hers? Doesn't the name Lord Asriel have slightly Satanic connotations?  And - gasp - what about those rumors of &quot;severed children&quot;... not to mention the talking bears.<br />The world of Philip Pullman's novel is a strange one ... or is it several worlds all in one? By novel's end, you will have some answers but many more questions.  You will want to pick up a copy of the trilogy's second book &quot;The Subtle Knife&quot;.  You will like Lyra Bellacqua, the novel's child heroine, a lot more than you did when you were first introduced to her.  You will want to know more about the Elementary Particles and will wish to brush up on your book of Genesis.<br />Will you like this book better than Harry Potter? Possibly.  Harry Potter has a more immediate, accessible appeal.  &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; builds more slowly.  Both however are masterfully creative, the Pullman just requires more work.<br />I have heard Books Two and Three in this trilogy are much easier to get into. I'm interested to see what comes next.	2001-05-23

After having been enthralled by &quot;All Souls' Rising&quot; I have to say I was disappointed with this follow-up.<br />The same characters are all there as are Bell's masterful historical descriptions but something was missing.  I too often grew bored and had to put the book down.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is that dissuades me from giving this book a stellar review.  I suppose at the end of the day I didn't feel as though I really learned much about any of these characters, and subsequently, I didn't care about them.  Toussaint L'Ouverture remains somewhat of an enigma despite Bell's painstakingly detailed account.  Perhaps this is intentional.  Perhaps the point here is that Toussaint is - was - unknowable.  This may well be true, but it doesn't make for satisfying reading.<br />Again, there are impressive set pieces galore.  Bell's mastery of historical detail is staggering and genuine moments of suspense sporadically leap off the page.  But in the end, none of this was enough to keep me compelled.	2001-04-02

Meticulously researched and brilliantly written, right from the beginning, the reader is enmeshed in the personal stories of the men and women who fought and died in what is considered one of World War Two's most defining battles.  This is not a mere parade of facts and figures. William Craig brings this story to life with prose that reads like a great novel.  As the horror mounts, the reader comes to sympathize with those on both sides of the conflict. In the end, there are no winners.  Everyone - Russian and German - has suffered a staggering toll.  Not for the faint of heart, Craig spares the reader no detail.  This is a book I will not soon forget.	2001-03-11

It is also twice as long as its predecessors.  Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better.  While the climax is riveting - and very frightening - I felt there were moments scattered throughout the book that somewhat dragged. I didn't have this complaint with the other three. Still I kept turning the pages, desperately wanting to know what was going to happen next.<br />Rowling introduces plenty of new characters - Professor &quot;Mad Eye&quot; Moody is a really welcome addition - and continues to flesh out such familiar ones as Hermione, Ron, Hagrid, and - of course - Harry, who at fourteen is starting to come of age.  This novel also features the rather horrific - and I suppose inevitable - death of another fairly major player.<br />Rowling continues to impress me with her seemingly limitless creativity.  I continued to be surprised and delighted ... and also rather repulsed by some of her less savory characters and incidents.  A storm is definitely gathering and I look forward to seeing where things lead in the fifth and subsequent volumes.	2001-02-09

Rowling's astoundingly successful Harry Potter series is an exciting and compelling read from page one.  Here again are all our favorite characters, both good -- Harry, Ron, Hermione, Hagrid, Dumbledore - and bad - Professor Snape, Draco Malfoy -- and a host of new ones to whet the reader's imagination.  There's a serial killer on the loose who seems to have escaped from prison with the intent of inflicting mortal harm on our illustrious hero.  <br />Rowling writes with gusto.  The plot barrels along with one twist and turn after another with a fair amount of humor to keep things from getting too dark, although of the first three novels, this is certainly the most frightening,the most violent, and perhaps the most poignant. The reader learns more about the events leading up to the death of Harry's parents and, as it turns out, the circumstances surrounding this defining event in our young hero's life are shrouded in mystery.  Rowling keeps you guessing until the climax.<br />Aside from the plot, Rowling succeeds best in making Harry a  real, flesh-and-blood character confronted with questions and emotions that many of us face. Whether we're thirteen years old or thirty, there is something here for everyone to relate to, even the most jaded of readers.<br />There's a bit of Harry, Ron, and Hermione in all of us.	2001-01-23

A year ago I made it one of my resolutions for 2000 to finally sit down and read it from cover to cover.  On this the 30th day of December, I am proud to say that's one resolution I made come true.<br />Mere praise doesn't do this book justice.  This novel, which spans twenty years in the intertwined lives of the Rostov, Bezukhov, and Bolkonsky families through love and death, joy and sorrow, war and peace, is - I believe - a testament to humanity and the importance of embracing spirituality and goodness to others in all our daily lives.  It is also a thrilling and insightful account of the Napoleonic wars told from the Russian perspective.  A host of historical figures pass through these 1400-odd pages - Napoleon, Emperor Alexander the First, General Kutuzov, etc - and Tolstoy succeeds in making every one of them real.<br />I think many people are daunted by the book's length. (Yes, it is extremely long and the volume is heavy to hold).  But the narrative voice is so strong, so compelling, and the reader is so drawn into the lives of these characters, that it actually reads very quickly.  The individual chapters are short enough to digest in numerous sittings spread out over time.  I found myself actually ploughing through a hundred pages in a single sitting, which is rare for me.<br />Some minor quibbles - while I realize that Natasha Rostov is perhaps the novel's central figure and while I appreciate the transformation she undergoes (from spoiled brat to spiritual earth mother) I feel that, from a modern reader's perspective, Tolstoy's portrayal of her bordered precariously on becoming overly sentimental and treacly.  I had this problem with several of the novel's central female protagonists.<br />The last hundred pages or so - once Napoleon has been driven out of Russia and the personal lives of our characters reach their literary conclusions - are bit a slow-going.  Nothing much happens.  There is much parlor room conversation centering on the political turmoil of post-Napoleonic Moscow and St. Petersburg.  It's interesting from a political perspective but this reader found himself once or twice closing the book with a plaintive sigh of &quot;Enough already!&quot;  The novel's final section abandons character and plot all together in favor of a dissertation on Tolstoy's views on power and free will.  For political theorists I'm sure this is quite compelling reading. I wasn't so enthused.<br />Also, on a more trivial note, while I think this is a fine translation, I was somewhat distracted by the speech patterns rendered in English for the character of Denisov.  The way it's translated here, the poor chap sounds like Elmer Fudd when he talks.<br />The battle scenes - Austerlitz, the siege of Smolensk, and Borodino - are enthralling pieces of military history.  Pierre's transformation during his captivity during the burning of Moscow is a revelation and are his earlier dabblings in masonry.<br />The melodramatic set pieces are fabulous too - Natasha's first ball, Pierre's duel,and the evacuation of Moscow are some highlights that immediately come to mind.<br />Very few books have made me question my own thoughts on humanity and the way people treat each other - specifically, the way I treat other people.  Tolstoy's insight into the human psyche is masterful.  The novel is unforgettable and one that I look forward to rereading from cover to cover in the not too distant future.othing much happens.

Part III, which takes place in a Mexican prison, is also particularly gripping.<br />It takes a few pages to get into the flow of the characters and plot.  It also doesn't help that McCarthy doesn't use quotation marks to separate dialogue from prose, but once you become acclimated to his writing style, this ceases to be a distraction or a source of confusion.  <br />My only real criticism is that I found the 4th part a little ponderous and perhaps a little too bogged down in description. While my attention didn't flag, I found myself wishing the author would just get on with it.  But the ending is truly moving and the overall reading experience is one you are not likely to forget any time soon.<br />Now let's see how the movie turns out.	2000-12-22

It tells the story of two brothers, Felix and Gabriel Cobb; Charis, Gabriel's wife; Walter Smith, an American plantation owner in British East Africa; Colonel Von Bishop, Walter's neighbor, nemesis, and colonel in the German army; and Liesl Von Bishop, the colonel's bored and lonely wife. The War brings these people together from the far corners of the Earth and forces them into an interaction with tragic consequences.<br />The characters are never short of involving. The plot clips along at a breathless pace and there are at least two or three set pieces that are staggering examples of narrative brilliance. One of the author's greatest triumphs here is his ability to capture the environment and pervading atmosphere of sub-Saharan Africa during the War.  When he speaks of swarms of black flies hovering over and resting on a corpse baking in the desert sun, the reader really feels it.  The author is equally successful at capturing the aristocratic tone and manner of an English country house as well as a seedy, bohemian nightclub in London.<br />There is hope at the end, but a dubious kind of hope.  There is the possibility for renewal but not necessarily redemption.<br />Boyd's images will linger long after the reader has turned the final page, haunting and insistent.	2000-12-08

But at the same time I was alternately beguiled, moved, and genuinely felt myself caring for these characters in a way no new novel of this year has made me feel.  <br />The theme of White Teeth is cultural displacement:  (When is the last time you read a new book and was actually able to decipher a meaning behind it?)  Two families - one Pakistani, one half-British/half-Jamaican - over the last 25 years with excursions into turn of the century Jamaica, WW2 North Africa, and colonial India.  It is essentially the story of what happens when immigrant children try to break ties with their cultural heritage to assimilate into their adopted land.  In some ways this book reminded me of the recent film &quot;East is East&quot; which dealt with a similar issue, also in a very humorous and poignant way.<br />For all its narrative and linguistic flourishes, White Teeth remains a singularly intimate book about family, culture, religion, and the challenges of growing up in an environment where no matter how hard you try to fit in, you will always be marked as different.<br />I was utterly charmed.	2000-11-28

His prose is consistently fluid and within the body of each of this novel's parts - ie stories - he often succeeds in creating a narrative that is suspenseful and imaginative, but where he fails is in creating flesh-and-blood characters that the reader cares about. Instead, they come off as mere symbols, the significance of whom is unclear.  <br />The plot structure - a sort of La Ronde where one character in one story is indirectly linked with a character from another, a global six degrees of separation - while at first of interest becomes increasingly muddled as the novel progresses.  This isn't an easy read and it may be beneficial to set up a character chart to help keep the interrelationships straight.  <br />There also appears to be a ghost story running throughout - something to do with the transmigration of an errant soul. I wasn't keen.<br />Again though, David Mitchell is a talented writer and there are moments throughout that are quite inspired.  I particularly liked the first chapter &quot;Okinawa&quot; in which he portrays the paranoia of a member of the cult responsible for the sarin gas attack in Tokyo.  &quot;Petersburg&quot;, which tells the story of art forgers in Russia, is also quite involving. And the novel's penultimate chapter &quot;Night Train&quot;, which reads like a radio show transcript set during what appears to be the brink of World War Three, manages to gain a certain level of suspense, though I think this reader at least missed its point.<br />I would be interested in reading more from this author.  I understand his second novel is in the works. &quot;Ghostwritten&quot;, however, is just not my bag.	2000-11-14

Ishiguro's latest is constructed a bit like a jigsaw puzzle - seemingly disparate pieces come together in a plot that appears more densely constructed and complicated than it really is.  <br />The narrator, Christopher Banks, is an interesting enough character, particularly as he is relating the events of his childhood growing up in the International Settlement in Shanghai circa turn of the 20th century.  The tales of his childhood friendship with Akira, a young Japanese boy who lives next door, are filled with a child's sense of wonder and adventure as are his glimpses of his parents' not quite perfect relationship.  The reader gets the sense that there is something rotten going on but is never quite sure what it is until the end. <br />In essence, Ishiguro constructs this novel with a series of impressions - one dimensional glimpses of a world from the perspective of one character who, it turns out, is never really all that informed to begin with.  These impressions are by necessity rather fuzzy. (Hence, the novel's blurry cover image.) The reader never feels they are getting  the full story. As a literary conceit, this technique is passably effective but it comes at the expense of more satisfying character development. I wanted to know more about Sarah, the mysterious (and one gets the sense, rather tragic)woman who pops in and out of Christopher's life both in London and, later, in Shanghai.  Theirs is an involving relationship but Ishiguro suddenly abandons her at what one thinks is going to be a crucial element of the plot. She reappears later in what can only be described as a post script. <br />I also wished Ishiguro could have come up with a more insightful or intriguing way to wrap up the novel's plot. Not to give anything away, but the climax is very conventional, much in the style of an Agatha Christie novel.  This reader at least felt rather cheated.<br />I did find Ishiguro'sdescriptions of wartorn Shanghai very vivid and exciting, particularly Christopher's excursion through the slums (&quot;warrens&quot;) of the city.  Unfortunately, the premise for this cat-and-mouse excursion is unconvincing as is Christopher's rather clumsy assertion of character.  The reader wonders: is he serious, crazy, or just over-wrought at the prospect of finding his parents again? I was turning the pages, wanting to find out what was going to happen next, while at the same time shaking my head because it was all so preposterous.<br />There is something about this novel that didn't feel quite finished, like Ishiguro was in a rush to meet his publisher's deadline and chose to submit his notes and scattered passages of text.<br />In any event, this would make a terrific film along the lines of &quot;The English Patient&quot;.  In fact, it might even make a better film than a novel.  We'll have to see...	2000-10-16

At first I  was enthralled.  As someone who has always been extremely interested in  middle-eastern history and politics, especially in regards to the  Jewish/Palestinian conflict,I found Robert Stone's descriptions of  Jerusalem and the politico-religious climate dynamic.  I was immediately  drawn to the characters of Raziel and de Kuff and couldn't wait to find out  what they said and did next. <br />But then, somewhere toward the last third  of the novel, my interest started to wan and I had the sneaky suspicion  that this was all going to prove to be much ado about nothing.  The book  appears to be densely plotted and multi-textured.  The characters are  numerous and varied to the point where the reader might start to wish  they'd kept a cheatsheet from the beginning to keep track of them all.  Unfortunately, with the exception of the characters mentioned above, none  of them are that developed, and by novel's end they start to irritate, or  rather the reader starts to search for more depth than what appears to be  there. I found this especially true for the novel's central protagonists -  Christopher Lucas and Sonia.  Each of them appears to be in conflict with  their identities, their religious beliefs (or lack of belief), and the way  they are symptomatic of what is referred to as &quot;The Jerusalem  Syndrome&quot; - intense and previously unrealized feelings of religious  affiliation bordering on extremism.  But while they continuously find  themselves in situations that one might think would cause them to really  examine their system of beliefs, they seem as shallow and, well,  uninteresting as they were at the beginning.  <br />There are however some  terrific nail-biting set pieces here.  My favourite sequence occurs about  300 pages into the book, centered around an ill-timed adventure into the  Gaza Strip.  I found myself scanning ahead to find out what was going to  happen next.  In fact, I found this to be more exciting than the novel's  climax.<br />Not to say that this is a bad book.  There is a lot to recommend.  Present-day Jerusalem vividly comes across.  The reader feels like he or  she has actually been there.  Stone is also terrific at creating dialogue  for his characters - and there is a lot of dialogue, perhaps too much.  I  just felt for a novel of this length, the pay-off should have been more  dramatic.	2000-09-11

I  also love Rowling's descriptions and her names for people and places.  The  way she has her characters enter their &quot;magic&quot; universe is  delightful as well.<br />I will say though that there is more than a hint of  menace (one might even say an underlying cruelty) running throughout the  book that even I found surprising.  (I can only imagine how younger  children would react!) Harry, whose parents we are informed early on were  brutally killed, is essentially abused by his uncle - forced to sleep in a  cupboard, etc.  A three-headed dog nearly bites the leg off one character.

The  first part is misleading - taut, psychologically compelling, more-or-less a  return to the territory Garland first explored in &quot;The Beach&quot;.  What follows though is a book that strives to be multi-layered (like a  jigsaw puzzle, if you will - hence the meaning of its title)with seemingly  disjointed sections all coming together for a big bang-'em-up ending.   While the whole is rather perversely satisfying, the sum of its parts don't  always make for a compelling read.<br />The central focus of the plot is the  story of a young village girl named Rosa who has a brief - and fatefully  aborted - relationship with a semi-deformed young fisherman whose family  seems cursed by physical deformity.  She moves away to study medicine in  Manila, marries a decent, loving husband, and has two children by him.   When she and her family revisit her village upon the death of her father,  tragedy strikes in the form of a reunion with her ex-childhood lover.   <br />Another section of the book revolves around a Ph.D candidate's thesis  interpreting the dream-lives of Manila's street kids.<br />All of these  disparate elements come together in a conclusion that is surprising,  well-crafted, and really very exciting. Upon closing the book for the last  time, I found myself reflecting on all that had come before, piecing it  together and then tying it into the book's title &quot;The Tesseract&quot;.   <br />Unfortunately, I found a good portion of the novel slow-going.  The  writing certainly isn't bad - Garland has a terrific feel for naturalistic  dialogue - it just didn't keep me anticipating what was coming on the next  page.  Again, however, I really enjoyed the pay-off at the end as well as  scattered passages throughout.<br />This is the work of a serious  novelist-in-development.  I eagerly await Mr. Garland's next book and look  forward to the development and maturity of his craft.	2000-07-31

Perhaps the definitive African novel of our generation ... a story that traces the lives and tragedies of a Ugandan family from the sixties through present time.  While the first half of the novel reads somewhat like a  Dickensian novel, chronicling the oftentimes abusive youth and adolescence  of the book's central protagonist, the second half reads more like a  history of this African nation, with vivid often horrifying descriptions of  the chaos and senseless violence that took place during Idi Amin's regime  and subsequent overthrow.  For this reader, however, the book's most  effective passages detail the devastating impact of AIDS in Uganda in the  mid to late 1980's, especially as it affects the lives of the novel's  central family.<br />I hesitate to give this book a full five star rating only  because I found the last chapter, which brings our &quot;hero&quot; to  Amsterdam, lacking in the dramatic urgency of all that's come before,  culminating in what was for me a rather weak and disappointing ending.  Otherwise, I would rank this as among the best books I've read in the past  several years.<br />Kudos also to the book's translator. Originally written in  Dutch, this translation reads as smoothly and effortlessly as if English  was it's original language.	2000-07-17

I was more  drawn to Ananda, the alcoholic &quot;eye&quot; painter and Gameni, the  overworked/understaffed doctor who make scattered appearances throughout  the book.<br />Perhaps I was spoiled having just finished reading Ward Just's  &quot;A Dangerous Friend&quot; which also deals with politics and violence  in Southeast Asia.  I found that book to be a much more compelling  read.<br />While I am familiar with the Tamil struggle for independence in Sri  Lanka, a reader who isn't may be somewhat baffled by the political  situation alluded to in the book.  <br />A worthwhile read, haunting even, but  somewhat a disappointment (for this reader anyway).	2000-07-05

The brilliance of his wit lies within his ability to find the humor in everyday situations and people, whether it be  the humiliation of a young boy having to attend speech therapy class for  his lisp or the awkward embarrassment of screwing up French translations in  a language class run by a teacher who would have been more suitably  employed as a Gestapo agent, Sedaris finds the ridiculous in the  everyday.<br />One minor criticism, I found the book peters out towards the  end.  The last two or three stories aren't nearly as interesting or  humorous as what comes before them.  <br />But gay or straight, there's  something for everyone in this book.	2000-06-29

In  just a spare 256 pages, Ward Just recreates the fallen splendor of colonial  Vietnam at the start of the conflict and examines the opposing philosophies  of those caught in the gathering maelstrom - the American government  presence there to provide &quot;humanitarian&quot; aid and support the  rapidly diminishing infrastructure and the expatriate colonials who have  lived there for years in relative calm and peace who are unwilling to give  up what they call home for the sake of political interventionists who, they  believe, have little relevance on their lives.  <br />It's a delicate book but  one that gives you pause to think.  Ward Just is an verbal wizard at  providing descriptions of climate and landscape. His characters are finely  drawn and subtle (one might almost say understated) and the plot, while not  particularly dramatic in the more traditional sense, evolves in such a way  the reader knows something terrible is going to happen because the  inevitability is there.<br />In some ways, this book reminded me of the French  film done several years ago, &quot;Indochine&quot;, with Catherine Deneuve.   While the film is set in the 30's and chronicles the start of the  Communist conflict in Vietnam, it portrays a similar crisis of conscience  between the old established colonial point of view and the rapidly changing  tides of modern history.	2000-06-20

It's not every day that you come  across a novel whose central protagonist is a gay gangster who weeps over  the death of Judy Garland.<br />The BBC is producing a 5-part mini-series to  debut sometime later this year.  I can see someone like Anthony LaPaglia or  Clive Owen, currently starring in the Brit film &quot;Croupier&quot;, as  Harry.<br />The first couple chapters were, at least for this reader, a little  slow going.  But past that, I couldn't put the book down.  I think I  polished off the last 100 or so pages in one sitting.<br />It might help to be  a little familiar with London's underworld circa 1960.  I'd heard of the  Krays but didn't know too much about them.  Some of the slang might be  unfamiliar at first but you soon catch on.<br />I look forward to Mr. Arnott's  next book.	2000-06-15

When it's not, it's rather ponderous.<br />With the  exception of American Pastoral, which ranks as one of the greatest books I  have ever read, Roth's novels of the past decade read more like social  diatribes than narrative fiction.  The anger he sees in the world seems  propelled by his own disillusionments with love, women, sex, Viet Nam, the  breakdown of the American family, etc. etc.  He is also (and perhaps some  will argue) a raging misogynist.  His female characters are some of the  most grotesque figures I have ever encountered in fiction and in the Human  Stain, they prove to be the book's weakest feature.<br />Delphine Roux and  Faunia Farley are just not well written.  Delphine comes across as a  monster, which is fine, but Roth never gives the reader any insight into  why she behaves as she does.  The passages which focus on her are the least  interesting. Faunia Farley isn't a monster, but one does not feel  particularly compelled to sympathize with her. She comes across merely as a  sexual figure, not very bright and much maligned by everyone in the book  with the exception of Coleman, whose connection to her is dubious.  Is she  a victim or the cold-hearted, manipulative catalyst in Coleman's ultimate  downfall?  Is Delphine intended to be read as a victim? She seems more an  indictment against the radical feminism inherent on some college campuses.  Roth, as the author, clearly despises her.  But why?<br />(And thru it all  runs the thread of the Clinton/Lewinsky scandal.)<br />So I givethis a rather  half-hearted recommendation.  Roth remains one of my favorite authors and I  still look forward to the release of his books.  I liked this more than I  Married a Communist but for a great read and for those who have never read  a Philip Roth novel - my highest recommendation goes to American Pastoral.   That is literature of the highest order.	2000-06-06

There seems to be very little in terms of character development.   Mr. Pressfield's characters seem to be mere stick figures pasted against  the backdrop of historical events.  <br />The writing is also rather ponderous  at times.  There were several occasions where I needed to re-read a  sentence to understand it's meaning - strange choices in word order, etc.   The dialogue strikes me also as anachronistic.<br />Overall, I just didn't  care.  My attention wandered.  It's a shame because I've read such good  things about this book.  I found it neither compelling nor particularly  exciting. But perhaps that's just me...<br />For truly exciting and colorfully  written historical fiction set in the ancient world (albeit centuries later  than the events chronicled in this book), Colleen McCullogh's &quot;First  Man in Rome&quot; series is about as good as it gets.	2000-05-17

JCO's Norma Jeane Baker aka &quot;Marilyn&quot; is one of the most heartrending characters to come along in literature in a  long while.  Whether fact or fiction -- as someone who isn't too familiar  with the biographical details of Monroe's life I was somewhat curious to  learn more about her -- taken as a literary heroine (or anti-heroine as it  were) she breaks your heart.<br />Particularly strong is the first third of  the novel, detailing her troubled relationship with her mentally unstable  mother, the break-up of her first marriage, and her menage a trois with  Cass Chaplin and E.G. Robnson Jr, the &quot;Gemini&quot; of one of the  book's most intriguing chapters.  This is a relationship that will haunt  Marilyn for her entire &quot;fictional&quot; life, culminating in one of  the cruelest (and most tragic) discoveries I have encountered in recent  memory.  <br />JCO's writing alternates from an almost Joycean  stream-of-consciousness to sheer poetry, becoming increasingly disjointed  and fractured as Marilyn dissolves before our eyes. <br />This is not an easy  read from an emotional standpoint, though in terms of clarity of prose it  reads like a dream. Certain sequences verge into the grotesque. Toward the  end of the book (particularly in the sequence involving Marilyn's  relationship with JFK and his brother-in-law aka &quot;The President's  Pimp&quot;) the reader -- at least this one -- may find him/herself saying  &quot;Okay, okay, enough already.  I know where this is going.&quot; You're  repulsed, horrified, impatient but you keep reading.  I ploughed through  the final hundred pages in one sitting, so intent and compulsive my need to  get through it.<br />Having read this, I now want to go back and rent all of  her films...<br />One must remember while reading that this is NOT a biography  but a work of literary fiction ... and as much as possible, it should be  treated as such, although I admit, there were many times where I wanted to  know where the line between fiction and reality was crossed and how much of  the distinction was blurred. Regardless, JCO's Marilyn is a triumph and  this book -- whether you like it or not -- is a reading experience one is  not likely to forget any time soon ... or ever.  How many contemporary  novels can honestly claim that distinction?	2000-05-01

As a study on the &quot;thin line between love and hate&quot;, it works quite powerfully. I just couldn't warm up to the characters.  I found myself more interested in  the novel's prose and it's theories of hate as the flipside of love than in  any of the characters.  Only the cuckolded husband, Henry, elicited any  sympathy from me.  <br />I do though very much look forward to seeing the Neil  Jordan film adaptation with Ralph Fiennes, Julianne Moore, and Stephen Rea.   They seem to all have been expertly cast.  Perhaps they can breathe some  life into this cold, dispassionate world of the dead.<br />I do recommend this  book, but don't expect an emotional connection.	1999-12-28

As a preface to seeing the recently released (and critically acclaimed) film I thought I'd take a stab at reading the novel upon which it is based. For years, friends and family have told me how wonderful John Irving is and  it's taken me until now to realize how right they are.<br />Irving is a  storyteller on par with Dickens, whom he refers to frequently in this book.   His characters are very distinctively drawn.  You get to know them slowly  and find yourself really caring about them.  While some of them at times  may seem larger than life, they never cease to be real.  (The story also  happens to be terrific, but it's the characters who profoundly struck  me.)<br />A word of warning: while the film on its own is a beautiful  achievement, I would recommend reading the book after seeing the film.  I  did the opposite and unfortunately was distracted from enjoying the film as  much as I might have because I found myself dwelling on all that the film  left out, which is quite a bit.  <br />Michael Caine, however, is perfectly  cast as Dr. Larch and the cinematography is beautiful.<br />I will definitely  be reading more Irving.	1999-12-27

I was disappointed.  Granted, this is a very different sort of book from the previous three - set in  contemporary time, dealing with more contemporary (though certainly  universal) issues.  It just didn't resonate with me.  The central story --  one man dealing with his grandfather's illness and the ghosts that haunt  his grandfather's past -- is quite compelling,and their final scenes  together are very poignant.  But what do we make of the history of the  Fanshawe family ... and the rather alarming painting that is discovered  while the current residents of the Fanshawe house are stripping paint in  the living room?  It seems the Fanshawe's are supposed to parallel the  lives of the novel's central protagonists.  But then the issue is dropped  and doesn't pop up again until the novel's final page.<br />Barker is a master  of nuance and of getting into the heads of her characters and making them  real to her readers.  On this level, she does not disappoint.  But the book  as a whole is a rather minor affair and doesn't pack much of an  impact.<br />Certainly not bad, but not great either.<br />I look forward to her  next...	1999-07-07

The novel thrills as well as exasperates, especially as it starts to wind down at the end.  Plot threads are not all neatly tied up at the end and the repetition of several  character names -- Bayard in particular -- delineating three generations of  male descendants with the same first name can be confusing and obscure, but  the central story of Young Bayard Sartoris, recklessly pursuing the  fulfillment of a death wish out of guilt for the death of his brother in  World War One, is undeniably powerful. The plot concerning Narcissa's  mysterious anonymous love letters is also intriguing particularly in light  of the fact that Faulkner picks up this plot thread in a short story called  &quot;There was a Queen&quot;.  Horace Benbow and his relationship with  Belle, a married and &quot;fallen&quot; woman, also makes for delicious,  though highly literal, reading.<br />I was reminded in some respects of  Dickens.<br />This book, the first of Faulkner's series of novels set in the  fictional county of Yoknawpatawa Mississippi, is a terrific stepping stone  from which to plunge into his later works.<br />It isn't perfect, but -- like  Young Bayard's crazy, suicidal jaunts in his &quot;modern&quot; automobile  --it is a terrific and thrilling ride.	1999-07-06

I'll preface this by saying that I may be off base in my judgement of this book (and I invite others to agree or disagree with me), but I really don't understand the hooplas of praise it has garnered since it's reissue twenty  years ago.<br />While I agree that Hurston's prose style is lyrical and  easy-to-read and her use of dialect quite effective, I have a problem with  the novel's main character -- Janie.  Are we supposed to look up to her as  a paragon of oppressed African-American womanhood? I understand that she's  abused (in essence) by her first two husbands, but Tea Cake doesn't strike  me as any better yet she loves him above the others even though he most  directly physically abuses her.<br />I also found the climactic scenes of the  novel rather sensationalized.<br />What are we supposed to make of Janie?

I had to read this for a Lit of the American South class I'm taking for my M.A.  I read it in two days with a study guide close at hand as well as several background articles on Welty.  I'm grateful for the additional  materials, but even without them I know I would have found much to praise  in this book.<br />When I first started to read, my professor suggested  compiling a list of characters and their relationships in order to assist  in keeping everyone straight.  This was excellent advice and allowed me to  read without getting too bogged down in character names and trying to  figure out who was allied with whom, etc etc.<br />The novel is ostensibly a  portrait of one Southern family.  On a broader perspective, one can view it  as a deconstruction of the American South with its age-old social  structures and isolationism.  But it can also be taken on a much more  universal level.  Anyone who has ever felt like an outsider in any milieu  will relate to Ellen Fairchild, Laura McEvern, and Robbie Reid. Families  across the world aren't so different.  Robbie's statement in the novel's  climax: &quot;I didn't marry into them, I married George!&quot; is, I  thought, particularly insightful.<br />I honestly can't praise this book  enough.  It has inspired me to want to read more of Welty's work as well as  other great Southern writers.

Vina, Ormus, and Raj are all terrifically  interesting characters when the reader first meets them; however, after 300  pages or so, one finds they aren't particularly likeable and the remaining  half of the book just kind of chugs along without a whole lot of momentum  or purpose.

This is the first novel by esteemed British writer Ian McEwan that I've read.  While I certainly found it an intriguing diversion, I am rather surprised it was awarded this year's Booker Prize.  The novel's central  characters--Vernon and Clive--are rather undimensional.  Their linked fates  are surprising, even somewhat shocking, but I didn't experience much in  terms of an emotional connection with them or the plot. What McEwan does  have going for him is a prose style that is lyrical and--particuarly when  describing the music of Clive's &quot;Millenium&quot; symphony--entirely  musical.<br />Recommended--but if you're looking for a little more substance,  try &quot;Master Georgie&quot; by Beryl Bainbridge, one of the novels  &quot;Amsterdam&quot; beat out for this year's Booker Prize.	1998-12-04
