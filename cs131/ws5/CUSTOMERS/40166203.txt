It takes the lovely drawings of Cicely Mary Barker and places them with photographs of flowers, and combines them in different ways. It is neatly done. The text describes the different fairies and what their personalities are like. It is sweet but uninspired. We're looking forward to reading others id the Flower Fairy Friends series.	2004-12-15

I thought the portrayal of modern-day practitioners of witchcraft was excellent. There were many well-defined characters, though some of them - such as Astrid and Aylward - didn't get as big of a part as I had hoped. There was a little too much battle action for me, but overall, an entertaining and well written book. It made me realize just how dependent I am on modern technology.	2004-11-01

When I finished the last page I just *embraced* this book. I wish I could read it for the first time again.	2004-10-11

I would like to see a book written on that topic.	2004-09-20

Kim Stanely Robinson is one of the best sci-fi writers working today; in fact, I find him one of the most intelligent and talented writers in any genre. Scenes from these books (originally published separately) come into my mind frequently. The people living in storage containers. The \\"perfect fast food meal.\\" The last book was somewhat utopian, very mellow and uplifting. I highly recommend this book.	2004-09-15

I also thought the characterizations were rather glib and the writing less than pristine. A beach book; nothing I would consider reading again.	2004-09-15

I don't know what the book reviewers are on about - maybe they object to the many references to breastfeeding and breast milk. To me, they signify the most essential human relationship that exists, and also echo the relationship between humans and mother earth. This book has some of the best drawn characters that I have encountered - ever. For that alone I would give it five stars. It also has a great story, and delves into philosphy and science in a way that is not pedagogicor preachy. KSR's explanation of the place of mathematics is elegant. What a wonderful teacher he would be. This book does not perhaps stand on it's own, but neither is it intended to. The images and ideas I grasped from it will be with me until the next book comes out. Perhaps the other reviewers expected another Red Mars - this is different, not as dense or serious - but just as good.	2004-06-21

I say interiors rather than homes because it clear that no one could actually survive in any of these ornate, pristine, elegant, and rather stuffy rooms.<br />The &quot;750 tips&quot; are given in sidebars, and poor production has allowed that some of the tips are not on the same page as the photo to which they refer. This book also contradicts its own advice - frequently - as when it says to &quot;always hang pictures 10&quot; above seating&quot; accompanied by a lovely photo of a sofa that is backed up directly against framed pictures. Or when they advise not using scatter pillows on chairs or stools, yet this is done throughout the text.<br />750 is a bit of an exageration - they break down &quot;how to build a fire&quot; into many small tips, counting each one.<br />Overall, a fairly useless book, but the photos are pretty. A nice gift for the billionaire on your list.	2004-02-10

It is about a man's obsession to possess a woman, ie all he ever wanted. The main character is neither likable nor particularly interesting. The object of his affection (and there are some rotten puns on that name)is unappealling as well. So what is there to hold one's attention? The writing is deft and accurate, but it is not enough. I didn't like this story. It was very gloomy and self-consciously literary.	2003-12-05

It is another in the slew of mystery novels featuring Britiesh gentlemen detectives, combining crime solving with personal dilemmas. This is similar to books written by Ruth Rendell. What I liked best about the book was the descriptions of Cambridge, which brought back my own university days. What I liked least was the murder plot - this writer is so good that I don't think she needs to rely on formula. She would do just fine writing straight literary fiction.<br />I read this several years ago and then reread it - I didn't realize that I had already read it till half-way through, so I guess it is not a particularly memorable book.	2003-12-05

This is one of those books that I put in the class of &quot;books for people who want to learn about stuff but don't want to actually work at it.&quot; Witness the popularity of &quot;what you can learn from proust&quot; - how many who read that had read &quot;A la recherche du temps perdu?&quot; So this is an historical novel about the publication of the first translation of Dante's &quot;Inferno&quot; and you can learn about the history of Cambridge and toss little bits about Lowell and Holmes into your dinner conversation. The murder mystery part is to keep you slogging through the dull bits.<br />I'm not saying this an awful book, but there is so much being published today and one can only read so much. The writer obviously put a lot of work into this; I wish his editor had as well.	2003-12-05

She sleeps, mostly, and once a week pulls herself out of bed to visit her therapist. We know she gifted because she tells us so, ad nauseum, but there is little evidence of her giftedness in her thought processes. She is really quite dull. So, she follows her therapist's 5-point-plan to enhance her social life and it more or less works, and she ends up in bed with exactly the man we knew she would from the beginning. Not recommended.<br />I feel this author has promise and can do better than this.	2003-12-05

In her first, invaluable, book she noted the ten most common decorating mistakes and how to solve them. This book recaps much of what was said in her first. The best points in this book are her true-life examples of problem solving. The primary flaw is the lack of photographs or detailed illustrations. Ms. Ward prides herself on giving useful decorating advice, which she does extremely well, as opposed to those coffee table decorating books that require huge outlays of money to achieve anything like the proposed results. Nevertheless, photographs would greatly enhance the text and the reader's understanding of the principles she espouses. Another flaw with the book is the title &quot;Trade Secrets&quot; - it is hardly a trade secret that Hold Everything sells organizers. A better title would be &quot;Tips from Use What You Have Decorating.&quot; This book reinforces whot one has learned from the first, and I must say that &quot;Use what you Have Decorating&quot; is one of the best books in this genre.	2003-11-03

The main characters in the book - Kath's husband, sister, niece, brother-in-law - are less interested in why she died - who was she? what did she feel? - than in how she may have decieved or betrayed them while she was alive. A narcissistic pack, they are. Kath, who was so imminently lovable, seems to have lived without love. Only her close friend seems to have any insight to her - and it is to her they all flock in the end, more to resolve issues in their own lives than anything to do with the poor dead woman. This book made me very sad. Starkly written, lovingly crafted, this novel is a little jewel describing the hard human heart.	2003-11-03

It is worth reading just for the education you get in that. The plot is the thriller-in-a-day variety that the author has used time and again. It works, but it's hurried and formulaic. I'm afraid when they make the movie (and they are sure to) they'll leave in all the action and take out the meat - Who is Mary, who is Mary Magdelene, what is their significance? Sigh.	2003-11-03

Will people believe her? I enjoyed reading this book but now it is hard to remember why.  There are no outstanding characters. The plot is not unusual or ground-breaking. I guess it is the small things that made it beautiful - the descriptions of the lush northwestern forest, the damp, the moss.

This is a great book for anyone who has a lot of stuff but stills feels uncomfortable in their space. It is also a great book for someone who is just starting out, because it will clue you in to what are the important elements in creating a welcoming home.<br />This is the best interior decorating book I have ever read. It doesn't show pretty pictures, leaving you to wonder how you can possible recreate the spectacular rooms in your own home; it truly imparts KNOWLEDGE. After reading this book I felt that I had learned something, not just been saturated with images. Most decorating books make you want to go out and buy more stuff. Not this one. It makes you look around your house with a new set of eyes.<br />While most of the book is about furniture arrangement, there is also information on lighting, colors, walls, window treatments, etc. The author does not promote any particular style, and the examples she use range from shabby chic to suburban-traditional.<br />After reading this book, I re-arranged my furniture, moved the art on my walls,  and reframed some photographs, and my house looks 100% better.	2002-02-08
