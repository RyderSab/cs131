Michael Cunningham has written 3 novellas set in the past, the <br />present, and the future.  Each contains common elements that include the characters, the setting, and found objects.  Each <br />includes the poetry of Walt Whitman.  Only 2 weeks before this <br />novel was released, I was watching Ken Burns' magnificent 14 hour series on New York.  It was only then that I was made aware <br />of Walt Whitman's ties to Brooklyn and his poems that heralded <br />the diversity of man.  Then my nephew, who lives in Brooklyn, <br />called me and told me about \\"Specimen Days\\" and how the book <br />revolves around Whitman's poetry.  Next day to Border's to buy. <br />What a joy it was to read this book.   <br />   As I have mentioned in other reviews, I am always intrigued <br />by special needs children.  This one will remain in my heart for <br />years.  My favorite section was the PAST, dealing with machinery <br />and how it impacted Lucas, the elf boy; Simon, his brother; and <br />Catherine, a worker at a sweat shop that mirrors the Triangle <br />Shirt Factory.  I shed tears as Lucas had to take care of his <br />parents while also going to work replacing his brother. <br />   I am now reading a biography of Whitman and \\"Leaves of Grass.\\"  My nephew has told me that I must read \\"Flesh and <br />Blood,\\" his favorite Cunningham novel.  By the way, he's 24 and <br />I'm 59.  Yes, we can learn from our children.	2005-07-31

There is a conglomeration of characters, way to many for me to keep track of.  Too much description of Hawaii's flora and fauna.  Too much repetition of facts and events that had already occured.  I skipped over a lot of the last several pages just to get this one done.	2005-07-31

My niece and nephew are students at NYU and I bone up on New York history so that I know where to visit.  They even buy me books about NYC because they know about my love of it.  My nephew bought me Downtown last year for Christmas.  I love Hamill's book because he has written about many places that I love. I envy him that he has had the opportunity to grow up in <br />New York and can tell wonderful tales of his experiences.  I <br />watched a documentary on jazz in New York and saw him tell his <br />tales of visiting venues when he was young.  How lucky for him. <br />His stories of Battery Park, 42nd Street, Times Square, etc. <br />make me want to get on the plane right now.  I am just now <br />finishing Ken Burns' New York 14 hour DVD and can't wait until <br />I visit my favorite city in the world...Pete, you've made my day.  My nephew made a great choice.	2005-07-31

A young boy <br />with autism bases his day on how many cars of a certain <br />color he sees on his bus ride to school.  He is freaked out by <br />people touching him and has a father who tries to be understand- <br />ing of his needs, difficult they may be.  I was awestruck at the <br />quest he undertook and could feel so deeply his fears.   <br />   I look at the author, Mark Haddon, and wonder how he could <br />have written such a touching, knowledgeable novel without having <br />maybe walked in Christopher's shoes. I so loved this book and <br />read it in one sitting.  It opened up am understanding of autism, as we never had autistic children at my school.	2005-07-25

Even into my high <br />school years in the early sixties, punctuation was continued to <br />be taught.  I am a punctuation freak and cannot even send an <br />e-mail without including correct apostrophes, commas, and  <br />capital letters.  As you can see, I am a proponent of the <br />Oxford comma (using commas in a series).  Lynne Truss amused <br />me with her strict adherence to the rules and her chagrin at <br />those who falter. I admire her intentions.  However, I'm afraid <br />that her audience will probably be those who already know how  <br />to use punctuation properly.   <br />   I look back on all the students in Southwest Detroit that I <br />tried to teach punctuation...singular possessive and plural <br />possessive.  If you are listing items in a series, use a comma <br />after each item except the last.  I can bet you that none of my <br />little gang-bangers remember any rules of punctuation. <br />   While this was not a punctuation lesson, I was trying to <br />teach the use of double negatives.  \\"Ok, class, I don't have <br />no money.  If I don't have NO money, I must have SOME money.\\" <br />Confused looks met me from all my students.  \\"Ms. Kirsch, if <br />you ain't got NO money, then you ain't got NO money.  How can <br />you SOME money?\\"  Lord, help me! <br />   I guess I enjoyed the book from my own standards of reading. <br />However, I've looked over my text here and wondered if it would <br />have met Lynne's standards. <br />	2005-07-14

We soon forget that Ned Kelly is a lifeguard in Florida.  <br />He hooks up 4 old friends from Brockton, Mass. to  <br />pull a multi-million dollar art heist. His only job is to set off some alarms to divert the police.  He soon finds out that the theft has gone terribly wrong, and he becomes a suspect in multiple murders.  His quest for redemption takes him back to Boston with questions for his dying father.  FBI Agent Ellie Shurtleff becomes a most unlikely accomplice in trying to prove his innocence.  Just when you think you know what is going to  <br />happen, it takes some weird twists.  It was a 2 day read, as <br />are all of Patterson's...interesting, exciting, unpredictable. <br />I am liking these authors he is co-writing with.  Except for <br />\\"The Jester,\\"  he is back on my A-list. I think you will enjoy.	2005-07-14

Yes, these <br />characters are like family who have become almost too predictable <br />after 11 books.  While there are still laugh aloud moments, they <br />are fewer and farther in between.   <br />   I did like the fact that Stephanie made a decision to quit <br />bounty hunting, and her job at the Kluck-in-a-Bucket was <br />particularly funny.  If people could get into my apartment as <br />effortlessly as they do Stephanie's, I would definitely move!!! <br />Also, there's no way this girl could still possibly get car <br />insurance.  While there is a mystery to solve, threatening notes <br />to Steph and the disappearance of 4 men and their cars, it  <br />actually only involves a fraction of the book. <br />   Plum eventually goes to work for Ranger and the heat is on <br />once again between them.  Maybe one of these days she will <br />decide between Joe and Ranger.  But we all knows what happens <br />when the sexual tension is gone...look at Moonlighting. All in <br />all, I did enjoy the book just because Janet knows how to keep <br />us laughing, or at least smiling. An episode with a stun gun <br />was hysterical.  <br />	2005-07-05

I hate when a book has as its come-on \\"just like the DaVinci <br />Code.\\"  I am always tempted to buy it because I loved that one <br />so much.  And I am usually suckered in. This one was so-so.  It <br />was amazing that the main character has a name similar to Dan <br />Brown's (Langford Reilly - Robert Langdon) and that the cover <br />had the same subtle script as its background. <br />   Lang is searching for the killer of his sister and nephew. <br />It leads to a Poussin painting procured by his sister.  Those <br />affiliated with the painting are soon dead.  His only clue is <br />a polaroid of the original and it leads him throughout Europe. <br />   Knights Templar seem to be the culprits, but they date back 700 years.  What is the answer?	2005-06-26

While I was so sure that I would give 5 stars even before I read this book, I was a little disappointed.  The team of Preston <br />Child always give me knowledge about historical facts.  They seem <br />to research topics that I am always totally interested in.  How-ever I felt that this book lacked in the research area.  I was <br />giddy with relief when I found out that Agent Pendergast was still alive!  I guess I knew it had to be.  I looked forward to <br />seeing what tribal group or historical beliefs were going to be <br />dealt with.  The Tano Indians were such a small part of the story.   <br />   Pendergast's brother. an abominable character, takes over in <br />the plot.  He becomes the killer who takes out those people that <br />Agent Pendergast is close to.  This book just became a Sanford <br />or Patterson read.  Not my Agent Pendergast who informs me of <br />tribal rites, corn plantings, or New York curiosities.	2005-06-22

Geneva Settle, who lives in Harlem, is at a library researching Charles Singleton, an ancestor from Civil War times. <br />She is trying to prove he didn't commit the crime he has been accused of.  Someone tries to murder her.  Geneva, being a very <br />bright young lady, manages to escape.  Enter Rhyme and Sachs. <br />We learn that her ancestor has a dark secret that seems to be <br />the reason that people are now, 150 years later, trying to kill <br />her for doing this research.  I love the way Amelia Sachs walks <br />the grid finding clues and bringing it back to Rhyme.  As the novel progresses, we keep wondering what secret Singleton must <br />have held to cause such havoc in the present day world.  I didn't have a clue until the end. <br />   Rhyme seems to be getting stronger as he upgrades his exercises and Amelia Sachs still loves him.  I appreciate their <br />relationship.  I also like the way Deaver keeps us updated with <br />the crime scene boards every few chapters and how the least little droplet at the scene can be so telling.  Bass boots with <br />right foot pointed outward lead our detectives to previous crimes that seem to have no relationship. <br />   As I read the book, I tried to determine how a Civil War era <br />secret could possibly relate to the present time...how hit men <br />could be after this young girl for trying to find out about the <br />past.  It was quite intriquing.	2005-06-12

The premise was good...a 2 year <br />old is abducted from a mall by two young boys and subsequently <br />killed.  The murderers are found, tried, and sentenced to a youth <br />facility.  Fast forward 8 years to the release of Rand, one of the killers.  He calls Delaware, who was the psychologist originally trying to determine the sanity of the young murderers. <br />We learn about the parents of the abducted child and the couple, <br />who through their religious organization, defended the killers. <br />The thing that bothered me was the 50 pages or so that Alex and Milo kept hashing out what they thought might be the answer to <br />the puzzle.  If it was him, then it could be this...if it was her, then maybe this happened.  Oh, but it if was this guy...you <br />get my drift.   <br />   The final culprit's motivation just seemed a little too absurd <br />to me.  I guess I couldn't see how someone could be that depraved.  However, I'll look forward to the next Kellerman.	2005-06-05

While he has no scent, he can detect scents like no other...adding the <br />exact proportions of each flower, spice, bodily fluid.  When <br />he detects the most perfect scent in a young girl, he must <br />kill her to capture her essence.   <br />   The story proceeds to a town where he murders many young <br />girls to create the perfect perfume.

Then came a couple more novels that were <br />OK...but then came \\"The Poet.\\"  I kept passing this book on to <br />friend after friend.  What a fantastic read.  One of my all time <br />favorites.  I buy every Michael Connelly, and while Trunk Music <br />was a major disappointment, I feel that this one is a winner. <br />   Bosch is back from retirement working \\"Cold Cases.\\"  A young <br />girl who was murdered in 1988 confronts him on his first day back on the job.  DNA links Mackey to the murder, but we just <br />feel that he may not be the culprit.  It seems as though the <br />higher-ups in the police department are somehow involved.   <br />   Kiz Rider, his old partner, and Bosch are once again working together.  They have great teamwork as they try to hone in on <br />the Chatsworth Eights...a hate crime gang who may be responsible <br />for the murder of a mixed-race girl. <br />   I recommend this book as one of Michael Connelley's best... <br />a good 2 day read. <br />	2005-05-30

Any book that gets compared to The DaVinci Code attracts my  <br />interest.  I have never read a Rollins book and didn't know what <br />to expect.  This one had a great start.  A cathedral in Cologne, <br />Germany is infiltrated by monks who proceed to kill all the  <br />worshippers and take the bones of the Magi...not the solid <br />gold reliquary that the bones reside in.  Hmmm, very interesting. <br />Now a group called Sigma is after a group called the Dragon <br />Court.  Gray Pierce is sent to investigate and winds up at the <br />Vatican.   <br />   There are Vatican spys, a love interest, a substance called <br />monatomic gold, and puzzles that lead throughout Europe.  While <br />I enjoyed the main characters solving the puzzles, I kept thinking that I would NEVER have been able to.  I'm just not that <br />smart.  It came so easily to them.  I have looked up many references on the Internet.

Of those that are returned, I sell many at garage sales or donate them to charitable organizations. <br />   \\"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\\" was a book that I didn't even want to lend to my best friend, but I did.  When she returned it in pristine condition, I heaved a sign of relief and put it on my \\"favorite books to keep\\" shelf.  I will NEVER part with this book again and will re-read it many times over. <br />   Oskar Shell is a 9 year-old boy who has become one of my favorite fictional characters ever.  Every little quirk of his amazed me...his heavy boots, his letter-writing, his tambourine, and his quest to find the answer to the key his father left behind.   <br />   I loved Oskar so much that I was aggravated when the story shifted to his grandparents and the bombing of Dresden.  It would have made an extremely interesting story in itself, but I was too fascinated by little Oskar and hs amazing journey to find \\"Black.\\" <br />   The week before I visited my nephew, a student at NYU, I told him how much I loved this book.  As we took the subway from Manhatten to Brooklyn, he gave me a review he had copied by Harry Siegel of the N.Y. Press.

As a middle school librarian who has read a lot of fiction for younr people, the only author who comes close is Jerry Spinelli...Daniel Zwick in \\"Loser.\\" <br />   I honestly cried through thelast 75 pages of Foer's book.

I purchased this book on a Saturday and saw the following Sunday it had made the top 10 best seller list.  Oh, good choice,<BR>I thought.  I must've missed some advance buzz.  Couldn't wait to start it.  The premise is interesting...4 Princeton roommates struggling to finish their senior theses...2 of whom have an obsession with an ancient tome, The Hypnerotomachia.  Unlocking the secret of this book was Tom's father's life work and the current drive of his roommate Paul. Miraculously, a different person manages to solve a part of the puzzle.  <BR>   Honestly, other than the 4 roommates and Tom's girlfriend, I was never able to keep the other characters straight in my mind.<BR>When someone gets killed, I had no idea what his role was in the story...and still don't! Such a confusing mish-mosh.<BR>   The eating clubs were an interesting bit of Princeton lore. However, if these characters represent the student body at Ivy League universities, well then thank you Michigan State!  I really only liked Charlie and how could he stand rooming with Gil?  I added one star for the ending.  Otherwise, I would have <BR>felt this was a COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.	2004-06-20

Two deaths of elderly people, one gruesome and one seemingly normal, have Magozzi and Rolseth perplexed.  When Grace<BR>McBride uses the Monkeewrench computer program, a pattern begins to form...the Holocaust.  The premise is quite unbelievable, but I have to admit to shedding a few tears by the end.

I had just finished Cabinet of Curiosities and Still Life with Crows (both of which I loved, loved, loved),<BR>and went to Border's searching for more of the same.  How delighted I was to see a brand new book by 1/2 of this great writing team.  <BR>   Three brothers are off to Central America searching for their father's legacy.  Each has separately enlisted a person to help him on his journey...a pharmacologist, an insurance company head, and a cult leader who have their own motives for helping.<BR>When their quest begins at the mouth of the river and with 300 pages remaining, I honestly felt there would not be enough to sustain my interest.  Oh, my, was I wrong! Every page was a new<BR>adventure.  Visually, Preston's descriptions are amazing and oftentimes very frightening.  His characters run the gamut from<BR>heroic to spineless, noble to comic...those you want to slap and those you want to give a standing ovation to.  During some of the final chapters I couldn't decide whether to just take a break from the tension or continue reading to get it over with.<BR>I soooo thoroughly enjoyed this book!<BR>   After passing this on to my friend, I laughed when she came into work one morning all bleary-eyed having been up until 4:00 a.m. because she just HAD to finish it.

Henry Morton, my favorite Bow Street Runner from &quot;The Thief Taker&quot;, is back again.  However, this time I was not intrigued by the mystery he is attempting to solve.

The fact that he bases so much of his works on actual historical data is giving me a jolt of knowledge I never knew before.

Whisked to the Vatican, Langdon finds himself in the middle of a papal conclave...choosing a new pope.

As a middle school librarian, I find myself reading almost as much young adult fiction as adult fiction and non-fiction.  I think my 6th and 7th graders will thoroughly enjoy this book.  Molly is an unfortunate young lady...an orphan, a bit odd looking, unliked by everyone at the orphanage except for her friend Rocky.  The orphanage is run by a group of mean-spirited adults who seem to despise children.  Even the head-mistress's dog is cranky.  <BR>     Molly's only safe haven is the town's library.  During one visit she discovers a book on hypnotism, shelved incorrectly because the H has been torn off.  She finds out that someone else has been searching for this book, the evil Professor Nockman.  (Can a Professor be this evil?)  He has travelled from the United States to obtain this book, and Molly overhears his<BR>ranting and raving when the book is not available.  She sneaks it out and now her adventure begins.  <BR>     As she reads the book and perfects the art of hypnosis, her world is turned upside-down.  Her many escapades are entertaining and cause you to cheer inside.  <BR>     While orphans and evil adults seem to be a recurring theme in many books for young people, the author is successful in keeping one's interest.  The twists and turns are exciting.<BR>I think that most young people will be fascinated by this book.	2003-07-02

I honestly was hooked by the end of chapter 1.  As the story shifts from Wisconsin to Minnesota, with similar characters in each locale, a computer game dealing with a serial killer has been designed by 5 computer geeks. Their history goes back to college 10 years before.  As their game is played out in reality, we cannot guess the perpetrator or the motive.  I loved this book...a 2 day read.	2003-04-25

Of course, they also loved when Ms. Kirsch got too teary-eyed and had to call on a student to read.<BR>   I have been the librarian in our school for the past 3 years<BR>and always have a young adult novel alongside my other reads.<BR>Jerry Spinelli is my favorite. Wringer, Stargirl, and now Loser<BR>are among my all-time most special books. I forget the storylines<BR>of many other books I have read, but never Jerry Spinelli's.  I<BR>am able to recount each character and the circumstances that<BR>were important in their lives.<BR>   Loser is a very special book.  Donald Zinkoff is an extra-<BR>ordinary character.  His giraffe hat, his love for school, his<BR>uncontrollable giggles, his belief that he runs so fast.  He<BR>wants to sit in that first seat in class, and yet his last name<BR>dooms him to the last seat in the last row.  Until the 4th grade<BR>when his teacher seats him in the first row.  Oh, how he loves<BR>that teacher.  Yahoo!<BR>   Zinkoff reminds me of no other student I have ever encountered.  Maybe by the time they get to sixth grade, they<BR>have had that exhuberance knocked out of them.  Maybe that is<BR>why I cried so hard while reading this book.  <BR>   While Donald becomes a hero in our mind while searching for<BR>the girl on a leash in a snowstorm, Spinelli doesn't rally the<BR>classmates in a stunning salute.

Lincoln Rhyme and Amelia Sachs make for such a wonderful team.  Kind of like Dennis Lehane's duo.  I enjoyed the premise of &quot;the Ghost&quot; bringing the<BR>&quot;piglets&quot; to the U.S...the &quot;lord&quot; who brings illegals to the United States.  A ship, an explosion, survivors, clues and more clues.  Deaver gives us those we love to love, and those we love to hate.  Sach's &quot;walking the grid&quot; and Rhyme's observations of the evidence are never a repeat.  New, new, new.  That's why this one is so interesting.  Loved the information about Chinese lore.  A 2 day read.  Can't wait for the next.	2002-03-23

The premise of<br />a homicide detective, D.A., coroner, and news writer combining their talents and intellect to solve a mystery is quite innovative.  \\"2nd Chance\\" begins with a murder that might be<br />viewed as a hate crime.  However, with the help of her best<br />friend the coroner, Lindsey the detective sees another pattern forming.  Another killing that leads in a totally different direction.  Then, just when you think you know the<br />outcome...yikes! there are still 70 pages to go.  Lindsey's dad returns after a 20 year hiatus.

Felt that it had<BR>potential.  However, after about the first 100 pages, I felt that<BR>this was a James Patterson wannabe.  Two to three page chapters with a lot of empty pages in between.  This could have been condensed to a 150 page novella.  There was no tension towards the end...everything just worked out much too easily.  I liked the fact that the heroine's father, Ham, went undercover into a<BR>subversive group bent on assasination.  But could top government agencies be so bent on their own glorification that they would risk the lives of important officials?  I think not.  Was very<BR>disappointed toward the end of this book...and at the 5 star review that Harriet Klausner (my hero) gave it.

After about the first 100 pages of Cornwell's I honestly had to check the author to see if I hadn't started Hiassen's first.  Patricia shows a side of her that has not been seen in previous novels.  Who ever knew she had such a sense of humor?  The terms &quot;dark comedy,&quot; &quot;quirky characters,&quot; and &quot;hysterical situations&quot; come to mind.  While some other <BR>favorite authors change their style or content with disappointing<BR>results, this is not the case with &quot;Isle of Dogs.&quot; I thoroughly<BR>enjoyed the laughs, the island inhabitants' unusual dialect, and<BR>the plight of the governor who had to resort to using a seeing-eye horse.  Each character evokes sympathy, amusement,<BR>or dread. Trooper Truth is my new hero.  With his on-line newsletter, he shares historical information mixed with a community call to activism.  Kay Scarpetta was getting a little weak in plot.  This novel breathes new life for Patricia Cornwell. Give me another like this and I will be very happy.	2001-10-26

I don't usually read short stories, but after hearing that Schickler got a phenomenal amount of money for the movie rights to &quot;The Smoker&quot; (one of the selections), I was curious enough to give it a try.  I wasn't disappointed.  After the first couple of stories, quite unique in content, the Preemption Apartments kept coming into play. Then previous characters started reappearing. I loved the way Schickler entwined it all.  What a cast of characters and situations it was!  I honestly had no idea where each story was going...and was never let down by the outcome. The Preemption Apartments must have had at least a few normal inhabitants...but do we really want to read about them?     Poor Charles, haunted by his brother's MOST BIZARRE death, treats his women in a MOST UNUSUAL way. James has a secret rendezvous with the Otis elevator each night.  A teacher is  asked by a female student how he feels about gnocchi!  A man<br />with a large birthmark on his face finds himself in dire straits.    I was reminded of Observatory Mansions by Edward Carey.  This too was a place inhabited by strange, disfunctional individuals. Francis Orme was similar to James Branch...unable to communicate.  Francis had his plinth and his underground museum, while James had his elevator.  Anna Tap was Rally McWilliams.

When their lives mesh 25 years later, tragedy has struck.  Dennis Lehane has become one of my favorite authors.  I could not put this book down...sorry, so cliche.  However, when I asked my dad how he was liking the book, he said, &quot;I wish it wouldn't end.&quot;  That's just how I felt while reading it.

How unique, how bizarre...and then I read about Francis Orme...a human statue, standing on his plinth, a man who has found inner and outer stillness, only moving when he hears the sound of a coin falling into his box. Poor Francis, living in Observatory Mansions with an unusual group of the unloved and unwanted.  Francis is a man who must wear white cotton gloves at all times...he cannot look at his own hands.  He maintains a unique exhibition in a tunnel connecting his home to a church...items he has either randomly picked up or stolen.  Each item has a story that he has conjured up.  Poor Francis...mistreated by mom, dad, tutor.  Then along comes Anna, incessant smoker and nearly blind.

Usually, I am  disappointed.  But I am positive that this was written by Jeffery Deaver.   Rune is a video store employer who becomes attached to an older man who  keeps renting &quot;Manhatten Is My Beat.&quot;  When he is found dead,  Rune is so upset that she decides to investigate.  The police seem so  apathetic about the crime.  As she watches the video, she is convinced that  an old bank robbery is the key. I liked her free-spirit, her way of life  (living in a building under reconstruction - undetected), and how Deaver  cleverly led you to believe certain things were happening, when they  actually were otherwise.  Surprises abound as you read this book.  I  anxiously await the other older Deaver novels that will soon be in print.

He now returns as a man running for President.  Unusual circumstances cause him to run before he is ready.  Lee  maintains his integrity throughout the campaign.  There are many plot  twists, assassination attempts, and a past love encounter to hold one's  interest. Woods includes characters from some of his other books, but he  does not feel the need to characterize them in depth.  Surprises abound.   They made this a good read.	2000-06-17

Just when I was so sure that I knew where this book was going, it took a turn before I was less then half way through.  OK, now where is he going?  He  kept me guessing all the way to the end.  The insects were interesting  (kind of like &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;).  His antagonists and  protagonists were so totally unpredictable.  The problem with Deaver is  that I am SOOOO ready for his next, but it will be another year or more.   If you enjoyed &quot;The Bone Collector&quot;, you will LOVE this one.  The  continuing back-searching of forensics information will keep you  mesmerized.  Read this one.  I know you will absolutely love it!  So many  twists of  plot...so little time.  It has been passed on to my best friend.   I know she will LOVEEEEE it. Jeffrey, you RULE!	2000-05-25

I have since looked for books that dealt with  this period of time.  I read a review of &quot;The Dress Lodger&quot; in  the Detroit Free Press and knew that I would be fascinated by it.  I was  not disappointed.  Gustine and Dr. Chiver led me on a historical jaunt  through an England that was beset by cholorus morbus...the deadly cholora.   Holman gripped me in the first chapter.  Her way of telling this story  seemed quite unique to me. While the book is quite morbid in its content,  her characters are well drawn-out.  I could empathize with Fos, Pink, and  especially Gustine.  I've passed this on to a friend and purchased Holman's  first, looking forward to another great story.    At 54 years old, I'm  learning about the history that I didn't learn in school.  I have purchased  non-fiction books on Teddy Roosevelt, WWI (about the flu that killed  millions of people that I never heard about), and now cholera.  Maybe I can  share with my students the facts that I wasn't aware of.	2000-03-21

The characters were not  interesting to me, the situation was not novel, and I found myself drifting  off to the other book I was reading (tending to put off this one).  I'm  going to give him one more chance &quot;As She Climbed Across the  Table&quot; hoping that he redeems himself.  I want to  like him.

I'm sure that the authors were totally on  target as to the killer viruses, molds, bacteria, and everything else that  can kill us.  It wasn't even a Biblical read.  It became an  up-to-the-minute testament of how nature can affect us.  I was totally  engrossed.  I think we need to examine these killers more closely.  Made me  think twice!	2000-01-19

Lionel Essrog has become one of my most favorite characters.  A detective/driver with  Tourette's made me love him til my heart ached and laugh so hard my stomach  ached.  I was glad my neighbors were away for Thanksgiving weekend... they  might have called the comic police!  Lionel has to crawl out of his little  comfort zone of those who grew up with him in the orphanage.  His mentor  has been murdered, and Lionel wants to solve this case. Because of his  Tourette's syndrome, his acquaintances look down on him.  He must prove his  worth.  Enter a giant, Zendo, a brother, Julia, and the usual suspects.  If  you don't laugh hysterically during some of his echolalia, you might need  to get a sense of humor. If you don't shed a tear about his pathetic love  life, put yourself in his shoes...miscues...fish news.  Yikes!  I've become  him. By the way, Edward Norton has procured the rights to this book and  from what I hear will play Lionel in the movie.  A great actor playing a  great character!	1999-12-03

When Ted gave Bobby &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot; to read, I realized how much of an impact it would have on a young mind.  I remember reading it when I was 16. I am now 53 and can  still recall almost every event that took place.  King probably read it at  an early age too.  Low men in yellow coats...where does he come up with  these ideas.  I love them. There have been King books that made me wince  and forced me to put them aside for days at a time until I had the nerve to  pick them up again.  But this one, it is a charmer.  Fully fleshed-out  characters that took me back to my college years. Don't look for horror in  this one.      Being a middle school teacher, I could totally understand  the caring side of young people as well as the brutal side as depicted in  the first story.  King is a master at portraying both. Read it and weep!  I  did.	1999-10-22

There  was enough of the mystical to pique my interest...but then there was sooo  much more.  I absolutely loved the way King presented information...a  little fact before he clarified it.

And then there were the ones you were never  sure of.  I cannot recall a book in which every scene was so vivid in my  imagination.

If it had been my book, I wouldn't have even finished it. However, a friend loaned it to me and I wanted to give it back by the next time I saw her.  Cut maybe 200 pages and it might have held my interest.  I cared nothing about the characters.  I had just finished &quot;Lucky You&quot; by Carl Hiaasen whose main character had also won the Lottery.  Oh, such a more interesting read.  Baldacci needs to learn that more is not better.	1997-12-31

Me too.  Not my William Kotzwinkle books.  They all still reside on my bookshelves waiting to be read again. &quot;The Bear Went Over the Mountain&quot; is no exception. Hal Jam is an exquisite character, and the people he meets are so shallow that they don't even recognize his &quot;bearhood.&quot;  The juxtaposition of bear to man and man to bear is delightful.  Tell me that you didn't laugh while reading this book and shed a slight tear at the end.  I can't believe I read my first Kotzwinkle book over 25 years ago.  Seems like only um-m-m, can I possibly be that old?	1997-11-19

Once again, Hiaasen proves that he is a master at making you laugh hysterically and cringe in horror at the same time.  Yes, I too miss Skink, but we must go on to other characters that only Carl can develop in such a bizarre way.  I will never be able to look at a road stain or a little turtle in the same way.  Hollywood, please don't try to destroy a a wonderfully funny novel like you did with &quot;Striptease.&quot; By the way, if you love Hiaasen, I know you will also thoroughly enjoy reading any book by Christopher Moore.  Give him a try.  If you don't laugh out loud countless times while reading his mystically demented tomes, you need an extra fix of humor.  Write on, Hiaasen and Moore!	1997-11-10

Carl's way of doing them in is so-o-o- utterly gross that you can't  even believe it.  Laugh if you may, but then go to the serious side of life.  If you like Carl, please go and read Christopher Moore.  His works are To-o-o-o funny.  He will also  respond to your E-Mail. He's my favorite author  to date.  Please read &quot;Bloodsucking Fiends.&quot;  I do love him!	1997-11-08

You must start reading Christopher Moore's books. Moore is not only SO-O-O funny, but he injects a note of the mystical in each of his reads.  Delve into shapechangers in &quot;Coyote Blue,&quot; vampires in &quot;Bloodsucking Fiends,&quot;  and the ghost of a WWII pilot mingled with a talking bat who wears glasses! Those tears you are shedding are both from laughter and pathos. If you are a devotee of Kotzwinkle, Tom Robbins, and Carl Hiassen, you will love Moore. His way with words is magical.  Please check out the reviews on amazon.  Does anyone else get all 10's? p.s. I have honestly laughed uncontrollably and wept tears in all of his books.  He is so special!	1997-10-29

Christopher Moore is probably the funniest author I have ever read.  PLEASE read Coyote Blue and Blood- sucking Fiends.

After reading &quot;Coyote Blue&quot;, I thought there might be a letdown with another Moore book.  Could he possibly be as funny?  Well, let me tell you, he's even funnier in this wonderful tale of vampires.  His cast of characters, which include the Emperor, dogs in pie-tin helmets, the Animals (a gang of after hours stock boys), a naive young would-be writer from Indiana, snapping turtles, a gay cop-straight cop pair, and a couple of irreverent bronze-plating artists, make for a wild romp.  My one problem is that only people who are familiar with Christopher Moore would contact this site.  With all these 10's as reviews, how do we get others to become as in love with Moore as we are?  Is there a rave review section (all l0's) that people can contact?  If not, there should be. Enough! I must go to start reading &quot;Island of the Sequined Love Nun.&quot;  Is that a title, or what?	1997-10-20

I have rarely read a book in which the setting and characters seemed more mesmerizing than the plot. Carr did this!  So with these two elements already masterfully accomplished, Carr had to rely on plot to tell his story.  And a great plot it is. However, it did not have the intrigue as The Alienist.  I did really enjoy it and read it in three days.  I have read that Carr's next books will be told by other members of the crew.  I will find that interesting, but will he be able to capture that dark, sordid New York as he did in The Alienist?  Who will tell the next story and which prominent persons will play the key roles?	1997-10-17

It's because I had so many papers to check and grades to figure, yet I had to start reading this book last Saturday, and by Sunday night, all bleary-eyed, I had finished it. I hate when reviews say, &quot;I couldn't put it down.&quot; Honestly, I couldn't.  The book is topically current what with the militia theme.  Bringing Aaron Stampler back as Brother Transgressor was masterful.  He is a most despicable creature.  The secret cadre of  Vietnam vets were an interesting bunch.  I'm still wondering if this is fact or the author taking liberties.  Martin Vail and his &quot;Wild Bunch&quot;  have become some of the best characters in this genre.  By the way, Thai Horse is my favorite Diehl book.  I must have a thing for Vietnam.	1997-10-17

I had to special order Box 9 because it was out of print.  I can't  wait until the next O'Connell book comes out.  He  has a wonderful way of telling a quirky story.

Apparently, the other 4 are out of print (alas).  As far as I'm  concerned, the plot takes a back seat to his delicious  dialogue.  There were many giggles, chortles, and  even guffaws as I read.  Here's to the little puppet  head, the usual suspects, and his aloof cat companion.  I'm off to some used book stores to see if I can  quench my Kinky thirst.	1997-08-01

The reference to Carl Hiaasen on the book jacket      lured me into buying Pest Control by Bill Fitzhugh. As Hiaasen is one of my favorite authors, I was  curious to see if Fitzhugh could come close to  his offbeat, demented humor.  Well, I can't tell  you how many times I laughed out loud while read-  ing this book.  It has already been passed on to  one friend, and several others are waiting for it.  The dialogue is so clever and I think it would   make for a hilarious movie.  Bill, I can't wait  for your next book.  Positively, Fourth Street.	1997-05-06
