The idea of bringing dinosaurs back to life will resonate with anyone who has ever been fascinated by these amazing creatures. Crichton's science, although fictional, seems so utterly plausible, and that makes it all the more magical and frightening. The writing is smooth and fluid, moving seamlessly from one episode to the next, and eventually effortlessly weaving several storylines together. The reader is hooked from the very first page. Don't start this book late at night! <br /> <br />The only places where the action lags is when the character of Ian Malcolm discourses on scientific and environmental ethics. The character is obviously a mouthpiece for Crichton himself, and although the ideas he presents are definitely thought-provoking, they come off as a little preachy and heavy-handed. <br /> <br />This is a terrific book, full of suspense, clever ideas, and likeable characters.	2005-10-12

It is hardly a Star Trek novel. Spock and Sulu are the only characters who are present in the entire story. Kirk and McCoy appear briefly at the beginning and end, and that's it for the Star Trek personalities. The writing is decent enough, but the story line is often one-dimensional. The descriptions of sword fighting and equipment are detailed (and graphically violent), but the author doesn't offer very deep insights into any of the characters. Particularly disappointing was the glossing over of Sulu's having broken the Prime Directive.	2005-10-08

Author Dava Sobel has included her own translations of many of the surviving letters which Galileo's illegitimate daughter Maria Celeste wrote to him while she was a cloistered nun. Maria Celeste is an impressive character in her own right, and her letters serve to humanize a biography that could otherwise be somewhat dull, and they offer considerable insight into Galileo's daily life and concerns. <br /> <br />Sobel's text is clear and often insightful, although the stories of politcal and religious intrigue, not to mention the plethora of Italian names, occasionally become confusing. The explanation of Galileo's position of supporting the Copernican theory while still remaining true to the Catholic church is tenuous -- and possibly it was in Galileo's mind as well. <br /> <br />The strongest parts of the book are the discussions of Galileo's two masterworks: \\"Dialogues\\" and \\"Two New Sciences.\\" Sobel gracefully intercuts events from Galileo's life as he was writing the books with selections from those books and clear explanations in layman's terms.	2005-10-02

Wolk's writing is folksy and often humorous, but both the events and the philosophical views were too pedestrian for my taste. Some essays are quite good, while some are quite odd.

The novel is set in 2027 and begins with the intriguing development of finding the body 50,000-year-old astronaut on the Moon. As with much science fiction, the characters are pretty flimsy, but the ideas they present are fascinating and scientifically sound. Other than a lack of strong characters and character development, the book is very well written. There are two episodes which introduce incredible revelations. They are nicely spaced and creatively written: one is presented as a New York Times article, and the other is presented as a taped transmission from a scientist. <br /> <br />\\"Inherit the Stars\\" contains wonderful elements of the best science fiction, such as Arthur Clarke's \\"2001,\\" Michael Crichton's \\"Sphere,\\" and the original \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" TV series. It also contains some of the worst aspects of cheap mystery novels: \\"I have gathered you all here...\\" <br /> <br />Hogan has continued the story in a series of other books.

Many of her suggestions are intriguing and creative: writing to a one-inch frame, comparing writing to a Polaroid photo, writing as a letter or a present. The best and most compelling sections of this book are those in which she writes extensively about her own experiences. Several sections are genuinely moving. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Lamott has a rambling, obsessive, stream-of-consciousness style of writing which reminds me of the Cathy comic strip. Here's an example from the book: <br /> <br />\\"You may begin showing signs of schizophrenia--like you'll stare at the word schizophrenia so long that it will start to look wrong and you won't be able to find it in the dictionary and you'll start to think you made it up, and then you'll notice a tiny mouth sore, one of those tiny canker sores that your tongue can't keep away from, that feels like a wound the size of a marble, but when you go to study it in the mirror, you see that it is a white spot roughly as big as a pinhead. Still, the next thing you know--because you're spending too much time alone--you are convinced that you have mouth cancer, just like good old Sigmund, and you know instantly that doctors will have to cut away half your jaw, trying to save your miserable obsessive-compulsive head from being cannibalized by the cancer, and you'll have to go around wearing a hood over your entire face, and no one will ever want to kiss you again, not that they ever really did.\\" <br /> <br />Some readers may find that style of writing delightfully funny. I found it wearing and annoying. To be fair, in this excerpt, Lamott was illustrating how the mind wanders when one is trying to write. But this was not the first excerpt in the book that dealt with mouth sores, and this writing style pervades the entire book. <br /> <br />It should also be noted that Lamott uses frequent profanity. I would not be comfortable recommending this book to aspiring writers younger than college age.	2005-09-13

The story is painted in broad strokes, with generous helpings of adventure, combat, and romance. The writing and dialogue sound quaint and stilted to modern ears, and the plot tends to meander. Borroughs' science may strike us today as a bit silly, but for 1912 it's very creative and imaginative.

Tolkien's masterful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. Like the second installment, \\"The Two Towers,\\" it is split into two stories. The reader must wait until nearly halfway through the novel to pick up again with Frodo and Sam in Mordor. This manner of storytelling is not quite as successful as in the second book, particularly when Tolkien tries to line up events between the two story lines. The chapter about Faramir and Eowyn, although beautifully written, seems almost an afterthought, being totally out of the chronology. The battle between Aragorn and the Corsairs is weakened because it is told only as a recollection. And in one chapter, Tolkien drastically overuses the phrases \\"and lo!\\" and \\"for behold!\\".<br /><br />But these are minor quibbles. \\"Return of the King\\" is a worthy successor to the first two novels, and every bit as richly detailed. Tolkien's ear for language and eloquent handling of emotional situations combine to produce some of the most heartbreakingly beautiful sentences I have ever read.<br /><br />The Appendices comprise nearly a third of this book. One can peruse these for hours, revelling in the incredible detail of Tolkien's world.<br /><br />\\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is one of the greatest literary works of all time. It is worth reading over and over and over.	2005-08-27

It's just too good. <br /> <br />The book is an affectionate portrait of rural Georgia in 1906, seen through the eyes of a 14-year-old boy (based on Burn's own father). The writing is by turns funny, moving, and profound, but always vividly descriptive. Of particular note is Burns' ability to handle Southern dialect in a fluid and controlled manner that is very easy to read. The colorful characters are complex and richly developed. <br /> <br />Burns employs an interesting literary device of mentioning an event or person in passing near the end of one chapter and then focusing on that event or person in detail in the next chapter. It has the effect of interrupting a storyteller by saying, \\"Wait, who was that, now?\\" and the storyteller replying, \\"Oh, didn't I mention him before? Well, let me tell you!\\" It's a very effective technique for a novel of this kind. <br /> <br />\\"Cold Sassy Tree\\" is one of the finest novels I have ever read.	2005-08-15

Actual punctuation rules are few and far between, and there are so many exceptions and alternatives listed that one may conclude that most punctuation is totally variable. The book reads like a stream-of-consciousness rant, particularly the chapter on apostrophes. (Truss, by the way, would argue that \\"apostrophes\\" requires an apostrophe, despite the fact that it's merely a plural.) <br /> <br />The book is heavily padded. It includes Acknowledgements, a Forward, a Publisher's Note, a Preface, and an Introduction. I was particularly annoyed to find that two anecdotes from the Preface were repeated in the Introduction. The final summation chapter is a rambling and meandering mess. <br /> <br />There are two unfortunate errors of note. In the chapter on colons, Truss uses the phrase \\"To err is human: to forgive divine\\" without mentioning that a comma is required after \\"forgive.\\" And there is a blurb on the back cover from James Lipton, identified as the host of \\"Inside the Actors Studio.\\" Nowhere in the text does Truss point out this show's sadly missing apostrophe.	2005-08-10

Tolkien's masterful \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy. This book contains some of the most powerful (Gandalf's confrontation with Saruman, Frodo's meeting with Famamir), most humorous (the reunion of the travellers in Isengard), most vividly descriptive (the landscape of Ithilien), and most deeply moving (Gollum finding Frodo and Sam asleep, the story of the Entwives, the choices of Samwise) writing in the entire trilogy. Tolkien also introduces the reader to two completely new and richly detailed societies: the Ents and the Rohirrim. The storyline has been neatly divided in two, and one of these sections further divides in two. Tolkien handles his diverging plots skillfully and with great suspense.<br /><br />I firmly believe that \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" is the greatest work of literature ever written, and a case can be made for \\"The Two Towers\\" being the best book of the trilogy.	2005-08-09

The first attempt in this genre, Michael Shaara's \\"The Killer Angels,\\" was brilliantly constructed -- the first years of the Civil War as seen through the eyes of a few select participants. Althought the events are real, the work includes fictionalized conversations and profoundly revealing insights into the characters. <br /> <br />Son Jeff Shaara continued the series with \\"Gods and Generals\\" and \\"The Last Full Measure,\\" but he does not quite match his father's talent, either in literary content or insight. \\"Rise to Rebellion\\" chronicles the Revolutionary War from the Boston Massacre until shortly after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Shaara has chosen four main characters: Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, George Washington, and British general Thomas Gage. Adams and Gage are nicely fleshed out, but Washington doesn't enter the picture until the last quarter of the book. Suprisingly, the portrayal of Franklin is the least successful, cartoonish and one-dimensional. Shaara is constantly winking at the reader when writing about Franklin. I kept expecting Franklin to tell someone to go fly a kite -- that sort of thing. <br /> <br />\\"Rise to Rebellion\\" is very slow to get moving, and Shaara has great difficulty with dialogue attribution: confusing at times, dull and hackneyed much of the time. But this is still a good book, and fascinating for its fresh perspective -- real people in real situations, rather than dry names and dates.	2005-08-04

Tolkien's world and its history are painstakingly detailed. Characters and motivations are deep and complex. The descriptive writing is breathtaking.<br /><br />In the second and third books, the story lines divide and become more complicated. But in \\"Fellowship,\\" the plot moves forward in a powerfully continuous straight line. The only place where the action stalls is the chaper \\"The Council of Elrond\\" in which the reader is fed huge amounts of information and backstory very quickly. For those interested in the history of Tolkien's world, however, this chapter is a bonanza.<br /><br />The Lord of the Rings should be required reading in high school.

Rowling continues to turn out one amazing book after another. \\"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\\" is as engaging, imaginative, and well-written as the previous five books. What is stunning, however, is the effortless manner in which Rowling has subtly altered her writing as the series has progressed. As Harry has grown up, so have the books. Book 6 deals seriously with issues of love, death, trust, and hope. The tone and scope of the series (and the writing) has shifted -- Book 6 is not for children. <br /> <br />From a mechanical standpoint, Book 6 features a much better opening. Rowling has found an ingenious way to hook the reader and bring him or her up to speed, without resorting to the formulaic summer at the Dursley household. Once the characters are settled in at Hogwarts, however, the storyline languishes for many chapters. Writing an interesting middle seems to be one of Rowling's failings. Two characters in particular cease to become sources of conflict and are in fact hardly seen at all. Fortunately, the final third of the book makes up for any deficiencies and packs a considerable emotional wallop. <br /> <br />There are a few typographical errors -- somewhat disturbing in a book of this visibility (not to mention price).	2005-07-22

Unfortunately, the book suffers from its own clever design. <br /> <br />Crichton has written the story as if it were an after-the-fact report. It's an interesting framework, and it hooks the reader right away, but it makes a build-up of suspense almost impossible because the reader already knows the ultimate outcome. Crichton compounds the problem himself by throwing in phrases about character reactions many weeks later. The book simply plods along, often reading more like a textbook than a work of fiction. <br /> <br />Crichton overuses two techniques. He tends to end chapters with the ominous \\"They could not have been more wrong\\" or some variation on that idea. And he frequently sets off incomplete sentences as separate paragraphs to give them more weight. <br /> <br />Something like this. <br /> <br />Both techniques can be effective if used sparingly, but Crichton makes use of them so often that they lose their potency and become almost comical. <br /> <br />In general, the book is well-written and thought-provoking. Fans of Michael Crichton will certainly enjoy it.	2005-07-09

He expounds at great length on many aspects of Victorian society. These mini-essays become tiresome after a while, and one begins to wonder about the scholarliness of Crichton's theories. From the standpoint of a novel, or at least historical fiction, the pacing is slow, the characters are one-dimensional, and the dialogue (featuring supposedly authentic Victorian speech and dialect) is often unintelligible. Cricton employs the tactic of introducing an unfamiliar word in a brief scene and then going into textbook mode to explain the word's historical and societal implications.

The fact that, as the book notes, it was given extemporaneously, is staggering. <br /> <br />A substantial portion of what would have become another \\"Dirk Gently\\" novel is included. Be careful with this one: it's good, but of course it's unfinished. We will never know what happened to the other half of the cat, or who Dirk's mysterious benefactor was. <br /> <br />One minor complaint is that the sources for each item are not given until the end of each chapter. It would have been more helpful to learn the source at the beginning instead.	2005-04-27

Each essay is a simple yet effective tip intended to make a relationship stronger or more enjoyable. Many of the ideas are perhaps overly obvious or simplistic, but they are all presented with examples and text that make them appear worthwhile and effective. <br /> <br />This is not a read-straight-through book, but one that can be read a chapter at a time, whenever you have a few minutes free.	2005-04-22

In \\"Travels,\\" Michael Crichton outdoes himself: \\"It is not easy to cut through a human head with a hacksaw.\\" Crichton is off and running, and the first nine chapters, all dealing with his medical studies, simply fly by. It's absolutely engrossing material. The book takes a sharp turn into accounts of Crichton's world travels, and by the time he segues into the paranormal, the pace slows considerably. <br /> <br />Crichton discusses his experiences with psychic phenomena such as seeing auras, talking (and listening) to plants, palmistry, being possessed, and on and on. He is a skeptic with a medical and scientific background, so his perspective is an interesting one. He makes a good case for there being areas of consciousness that we have barely begun to explore. <br /> <br />I have read all of Michael Crichton's fiction, but this was the first nonfiction of his that I have read. One thing is clear: the guy can flat-out write. When I can read page after page and not even think about the mechanics of the text, I know the author is a good one. \\"Travels\\" is a fascinating book, particularly if you have an interest in exotic locales and the world of the paranormal.	2005-04-19

I don't consider myself to be a power hound, but I have been using Macs exclusively for 16 years. I discovered a satisfying number of of useful and undocumented tips. About two thirds of the items are easy enough for a novice to follow, such as simple modifications of standard applications, and using Terminal to modify how the System behaves. (Working in Terminal gave me the same kind of thrill I remember from Res-Edit years ago.) The final third of the book is devoted entirely to Unix and was completely beyond me -- probably only useful to programmers. <br /> <br />There are a fair number of items that reminded me of David Letterman's \\"Stupid Pet Tricks\\" -- things you can make your Mac do just because you can, not because they are particularly useful. But I'm pleased with what I managed to glean. The writing is clear and the topics are nicely presented and organized.	2005-04-17

Chapters alternate between Tony Massarotti of the Boston Herald and John Harper of the New York Daily News. Their writing is clear, efficient, and totally engrossing. Each of the head-to-head meetings between the Red Sox and Yankees is examined in detail, culminating with a fantastic account of the American Leaugue Championship Series. Massarotti and Harper offer many fascinating and thoughtful insights, plus some looks behind the scenes and psychological portraits of a few of the players. Each series is covered by a chaper by each author, so the reader gets a very balanced perspective. <br /> <br />The only thing I didn't care for was the way the typeface changes inexplicably. The first four chapters are in one font, then the fonts alternate every two chapters. The authors alternate every chapter, so the font changes don't reflect who is writing.	2005-04-08

It's a thick, heavy book -- so much so that it's uncomfortable to lug around and even to hold as you read it. <br /> <br />Rowling's prose is as thoughtful, entertaining, inventive, engrossing, moving, and well-crafted as ever -- there's just too much of it. There are so many small episodes during the school year that have little or no bearing on the story and could have easily been left out. <br /> <br />One minor quibble that I have with Rowling's style is that the characters, no matter how nicely defined, are either totally good or totally evil. In each book I keep wishing for some shades of gray. \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" offers a tiny amount of grayness in Professor Snape and Petunia Dursley, but that's it. <br /> <br />This is an incredibly good book, for both children and adults.	2005-03-31

The novel is filled with richly detailed characters, beautiful descriptive writing, and terse dialogue. The end of the book is perhaps overly sentimental, but it is genuine. One doesn't have to be a football fan to enjoy this short, well-crafted work.	2005-03-18

The essays are grouped roughly into three topics: baseball history, the science of baseball, and critiques of baseball books. Gould was without a doubt a passionate fan and a keen intellectual, but the combination of these traits in \\"Triumph and Tragedy\\" was not particularly interesting to me. Gould's writing style is pretentious and wordy. Words like \\"equilibrate,\\" \\"decadal,\\" and \\"hagiography\\" abound, and run-on sentences are frequently encountered. The mathematical and scientific concepts in the science of baseball essays were far over my head. <br /> <br />Some stories and comments are repeated nearly word for word in consecutive essays. Reading about the Brooklyn Dodgers' lone World Series win against the Yankees in the 1950s, for the fourth time in as many essays, was a little ridiculous. This problem could have been easily avoided if an editor had simply reordered a few of the essays. <br /> <br />\\"Triumph and Tragedy\\" is not an easy or casual read. I would recommend it only to true baseball fans with an intellectual bent.	2005-03-10

I was not disappointed. This is a quick and enjoyable read, with quite a bit of dialogue taken directly from the movie. Dillard has an excellent feel for the familiar characters and for the Star Trek world in general. <br /> <br />I had only two complaints. There are some backstories, such as Carol Marcus's injury, which add nothing to the narrative and in fact bog it down somewhat. And for some of the movie's best and funniest lines, Dillard includes the characters' thoughts leading up to the lines, apparently trying to justify them, but unfortunately depriving them of much of their comic impact.	2005-03-02

His commentary during games is exceptional for combining the experience of a former ballplayer with a sharp wit, a fierce intelligence, and strongly held opinions. His style and personality comes through in \\"Oh Baby, I Love It,\\" even though the book was written near the beginning of his announcing career. I could easily hear McCarver's voice as I read.<br /><br />The book loses momentum when McCarver is simply reporting events, such as the Mets' entire 1986 season. McCarver is at his best when writing about his viewpoints and the stars he played with.	2005-03-02

Not as enjoyable or as deep, in my opinion, but still an interesting read. As in many of Callahan's books, the exposition takes forever. And just as typically, there is a huge Deus ex machina at the end. This particular one really insulted my intelligence. The wrap-up was just too easy and convenient. <br /> <br />If puns are not your thing, avoid all of Robinson's books!	2005-03-02

Sentences are often confusingly constructed, as if Grisham wrote the novel in a hurry and didn't edit it. Miss Callie is a nicely drawn, complex character, but the rest of the cast is superficial by comparison. <br /> <br />The dust jacket tries to play up the suspense element: \\"...men and women who served on a jury nine years ago are starting to die one by one--as a killer exacts the ultimate revenge.\\" But don't be fooled: the killing of jurors doesn't begin until the last fifth of the book. I'm terrible at figuring out mysteries, but the identity of this killer was obvious even to me. <br /> <br />Grisham tries to throw too much into the mix: life in rural Mississippi, desegregation, Vietnam, a discourse on Southern churches, an expose of the legal and parole system in Mississippi in the 1970s, a Wal-Mart style incursion -- all in addition to his legal story. There is so much material that nothing can be treated in depth. Nothing, that is, except the marvelous descriptions of Southern cuisine. <br /> <br />\\"The Last Juror\\" is an enjoyable read, but it is not up to the quality I have come to expect from such a fine author as John Grisham.	2005-03-02

Robinson is a master of language and a lover of puns and word games. Many of the puns are excruciating, and some take forever to set up. In fact, the entire second half of the book is basically a setup for a Dan Rather pun near the end. <br /> <br />The book suffers structurally from two flaws: the exposition lasts much longer than needed, and the second half of the book bears no relation to the first half. There are essentially two entirely separate stories. Much of Robinson's work first appeared serialized in magazines, so it's possible that these two stories were cobbled together to make a book. <br /> <br />Robinson does have some wonderful insights on human nature, but it takes some effort to sift through everything else.	2005-03-02

Eliot's poetry is clever and witty, and Gorey's pen and ink drawings are wonderfully cute. I am a fan of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical \\"Cats\\" which uses poems from this collection, and I found it particularly useful to find out what some of the musical's unintelligible lyrics actually are.

I was a little startled when I started reading this book to find that the text is all first-person stream of consciousness. Everything is written in dialect, with quite a bit of phonetic spelling. There aren't even any chapter divisions. This style of writing takes a little getting used to, and I thought it might wear thin quickly. It didn't, and the fact that King can keep a reader's attention in this style for so long, without breaking character or style in the slightest, is amazing. King is truly one of America's great authors, despite his attraction to the macabre and the supernatural.	2005-03-02

Ihnatko has an ususual, weird, irreverant sense of humor, which is nice to find in a computer book. He manages to impart quite a bit of technical information but makes it go down easy. If your sense of humor is more traditional, the style of this book will probably wear thin. And if you are looking for a straightforward computer-manual-style book, this probably isn't for you either. But I enjoyed it, and Ihnatko's style and attitude made me proud to be a Mac guy. <br /> <br />One caveat: if you're looking for information about the iLife applications, you won't find any in this book. Ihnatko blatanly says that you will have to shell out the bucks for his book specifically about iLife.	2005-03-02

Got it? Lawrence Thornton's literary device is certainly clever, but it's so complicated that the whole book collapses under its weight. The dust jacket gave the impression that this book had similarities to \\"The Caine Mutiny,\\" but that's not at all the case.    Thornton's premise is interesting and his descriptive writing is excellent, but this was not an enjoyable read for me. A knowledge and love of Joseph Conrad's novels is practically essential, as is the patience for sorting out Thornton's narrative.	2005-03-02

I am a huge science fiction fan, and after reading this book, I will gladly call it THE best. <br /> <br />Clarke is somewhat unusual among science fiction writers in that he a brilliant technique in addition to his brilliant ideas. The utter realism and plausibility of his fiction is striking, and in the case of \\"Childhood's End,\\" frightening. <br /> <br />It's fascinating to see how well this story, written in the 1940s, holds up without being dated. Only the occasional reference to radar ranges or the predominance of radio makes Clarke's work seem less than contemporary. The great similarities to the TV miniseries \\"V\\" and the blockbuster film \\"Independence Day\\" make one wonder why Clarke has not sued for plagiarism. <br /> <br />This is a well-written, thought-provoking, thoroughly engrossing book.	2005-03-02
