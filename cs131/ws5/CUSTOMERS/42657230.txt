Evers book is just what I needed. The book has lots of ideas for making nutrition education fun and interesting for children. She gives lots of activities and crafts that can help illustrate the concepts she presents.<br /><br />As a homeschooling mom, I like the way nutrition education can be incorporated into math, language arts, history, science, etc. However, if your child is in public school, Evers has lots of ways you can work with the school to get more nutrition education and healthier food in the cafeteria.<br /><br />I also love all the book recommendations given. Evers lists a bunch of titles that will encourage children to try new and different foods.<br /><br />One thing that is slightly dated now is that Evers spends a lot of time on the food pyramid, which has now been replaced. (However from what I understand, this new system is rather complicated so for children the food pyramid is probably much easier to understand.)<br /><br />This book is a great resource for parents and teachers.	2005-09-27

The premise for the story is great as well. David Henry, a doctor, delivers his own children. One of the twins has down syndrome and he has his nurse take the baby to an institution. He tells his wife that the baby was stillborn.<br /><br />From there on, we alternate between two stories.  We read about David, his wife Norah and son Paul who become divided as the hidden guilt of what Paul has done creates a wall between them. The other is the story of the nurse, Caroline who could not give up the child and raises her as her own.<br /><br />I found the story of Paul and his family hard to get into. None of the characters really touched me and I was unable to really care what happened to them. I was much more interested in the story of Caroline who is vulnerable and caring. I also loved way she found romance.<br /><br />I would have liked to get to know and care more about the twins - especially Phoebe so I could see what Paul and his family had given up. But the part that most bothered me was the ending. It was so anti-climactic. Paul just dies and we aren't even there. I felt cheated that Paul never had to own up to what he had done.<br /><br />But again, the writing is wonderful and I enjoyed the book despite the few shortcomings.	2005-09-25

Soy, nuts, corn, and glutinous grains are in so many foods that it is difficult to avoid them. Food Allergy Survival Guide will help you to figure out what foods you are sensitive to and how to replace them with healthful, plant-based ingredients.<br /><br />The book starts with an explanation of what food allergies and intolerances are and what they are caused by. If you ever wanted to know in detail how your digestive system works, you will get a full description in this book. Food Allergy Survival Guide also provides information about many medical conditions like arthritis, asthma, ADHD, candida, celiac disease, depression, dermatitis, fatigue, and migraines that can be caused by or worsened by certain foods. For each condition, there are suggestions of possible food culprits and suggestions to manage the condition.<br /><br />If you are not sure if you have food allergies or what foods you are allergic to, you can find out what tests can be used to find out. The pros and cons of medical invasive and non-invasive tests are discussed as well as some do-it-yourself methods.<br /><br />Once you know what foods have an adverse affect on your well-being, the trick is avoiding them. As the authors point out, foods like dairy, soy, corn, egg, and wheat are hidden in labels under all kinds of different names. For example, egg may be listed as binder, emulsifier, or coagulant. Corn can be listed as caramel coloring or dextrose. Food Allergy Survival Guide tells you what foods most often include common allergens and provide detailed lists of labeling terms that may be allergenic foods.<br /><br />The best method of dealing with multiple food allergies is to cook most of your own meals. Fortunately, Food Allergy Survival Guide provides over 100 delicious recipes free of dairy, eggs, fish, wheat, gluten, soy, peanuts, and yeast. Very helpful is the gluten-free flour mix, which can replace wheat flour in any recipe, and a corn-free baking powder substitute.<br /><br />I tried a couple of the recipes from the baking section for my holiday entertaining. The Ultra-Fudge Brownies and Pumpkin Spice Bread were a big hit. Besides baked good, the book also includes seasoning and spice mixes, breakfast cereals and smoothies, dips and spreads, salads and dressings, soups, main dishes, side dishes, and desserts. Don't worry if some of the ingredients are new to you. The book explains unfamiliar ingredients, and suppliers are listed in the resource section. I had no trouble finding any of the foods at my local natural foods store.<br /><br />Food Allergy Survival Guide is an excellent book for those suffering from food allergies but it is also a great resource for vegans. You'll discover ways that animal products might be hidden in processed or restaurant foods, and how to avoid them. And you'll love the wonderful vegan recipes.

I was happy to find her latest memoir just as wonderful as her other two. I just love Reichl's writing. She is funny, down to earth, a mom. She seems like a regular person - not a snooty gourmet who talks above your head. I love the stories of her escapades in disguise and how she came up with the characters and how she completely inhabited them. But as much, if not more, I enjoyed her descriptions of her meals and how they affected her. Her love and understanding of good food is absolutely fascinating to me. I can't wait to read her next one about being editor of Gourmet Magazine.	2005-07-28

His descriptions of the characters were so vivid that I actually felt like I could see them. Like the french carpentaire - I could just see him running circles around Alexander in a whirlwind of sawing, bracing, hefting, hammering, and chainsawing. And a lot of the stories were so funny, I laughed outloud many times - to the annoyance of my husband (who is now reading the book by the way.)<br /><br />The other thing I liked about this book is that Alexander manages to get a little social commentary in - his thoughts about the horribleness of trailers and why there couldn't be a nicer looking, less toxic way for people to get a low cost home or the ludicriousness of asking people to go into debt for the sake of patriotism are questions I would like to see asked more often.<br /><br />I can't say that every single story in this book was a gem - but most of them were really great. I highly recommend this book.	2005-03-25

Too many adverbs telling me how the lines were being said and too many substitutes for the verb said like \\"she quipped\\" or \\"she countered\\" or \\"she complained.\\" I would rather discern these things from the lines that are being said and how the character acts while saying them. It also seemed that all of the characters talked the same way (except for the obsenities added to Shoba's lines). The father used expressions like \\"go for it\\" which did not fit his character and Devi used out of date expressions that seemed more what her parents would say. Maybe I'm being too picky - from looking at the other reviews it seems like others were not bothered by this.	2005-03-08

The simple, healthy, and delicious dishes are exactly what my family and I like to eat. Atlas's recipes are so approachable - especially for a busy parent. She offers ideas for meals that fit into a busy family lifestyle - simple breakfast ideas, suggestions for school lunches, healthy snacks, and quick dinners. The recipes call for few, easy-to-find ingredients making this book perfect for even the novice cook or beginning vegetarian.<br /><br />This comprehensive book includes recipes for breakfasts, soups, salads, casseroles, pasta, grains, beans, vegetables, snacks, and desserts. For those who don't know what to do with tofu, Atlas explains the different types and gives many recipes that will make even those who think they don't like tofu, realize that maybe they do. I made the tofu burgers for family and friends and everybody was begging for more (I now make double batches!) I also enjoyed the section on seitan - a meat-like product made from wheat gluten. The recipe for homemade seitan is so easy and the seitan tastes so much better than the store-bought product that my family didn't like.<br /><br />In addition to all the yummy recipes, The Vegetarian Family Cookbook includes great information about vegetarianism, reasons to eat organic, substitutes for dairy products, nutrition information, and useful books and web sites. This book had already become the cookbook I turn to first when trying to decide what to make for dinner. Whether your family is vegetarian, vegan, or just trying to eat a more plant-based diet, the recipes in this cookbook are sure to please.	2005-03-06

I didn't look at it so much as a how-to book but more of an inspirational book for anyone homeschooling or thinking of homeschooling. The authors don't tell you want to do - they just relate what they did, why they did it, and how it worked.<br /><br />I loved many of the ideas they presented and we have already put one into practice - the idea of having the children write daily in a journal - or even just draw if they can't write yet. This is a big hit with our six year old who every night writes in her book something special that happened that day. What a fun way to learn writing, spelling and grammar skills and we'll be able to look back in later months and years and see how she has progressed.<br /><br />Even though this book is dated - most of the information and processes are very relevant to today.	2005-02-26

Atkinson is a really funny writer and I laughed outloud several times throughout the book.

Rather than explain the gruesomeness of slaughter houses which is what I expected, this author wrote about the cows about when they were alive. I was horrified to find out what cows are actually fed. Although, because of mad cow they are no longer allowed to feed dead cows to cows, these animals are still being fed horse, pigs, chicken carcasses, euphanized dogs and cats, roadkill and - I still can't believe this - chicken and other animal manure. Also, there are no restrictions on the amount of pesticides used on grain grown for animals, so they are very liberally sprayed - and this all goes into our meat and our milk. It's quite horrifying. There is a lot of other info about how the cattle industry is destroying our environment, info about the bovine growth hormone (I actually started to cry when I heard about what that does to the dairy cows) - the strain of producing all that extra milk sucks all the calcium and fat off them and they become sterile, and a lot about the politics and the clout that Monsanto has with the FDA. It's scary. The state of Vermont was actually sued by Monstanto for wanting to label dairy that had BGH in it - and Monsanto WON.<br /><br />This book was very well written, easy to read, and believable because this man was actually in the business. We were already vegetarian but ate organic dairy. Now we're vegan.	2005-02-13

He doesn't give a magic formula but realistic suggestions and personal experience.<br />I recommend this book for any writer and even non-writers who want to know more about the real life of writing.	2004-01-21

I read it every second I could and found myself reading parts out loud to my husband. David Sedaris is an incredible storyteller and even makes sad things funny. I can't wait to read his other books.	2004-01-19

I picked this up at a book fair for my husband and after reading the first few pages, just had to finish it for myself. The writing is unique and captivating, the story unpredictable, and the characters compelling. &quot;The Donkey Show&quot; book is both funny and touching. Both my husband and I loved it. We are looking forward to more from Welch.	2004-01-13

This book has so many great recipes and I am learning a lot more about cooking whole foods and even sea vegetables. I never cooked with some of these ingredients before but I'm so glad I found out about them and how nutritious they are. This book has really expanded our horizons when it comes to eating. And I haven't had any problem finding the ingredients - the are all available at my local natural foods store.<br /><br />My husband likes the dishes I've cooked - and my kids do too. All the recipes for sweets don't have any sugar but taste really good. I am happy that my kids are eating healthy foods and not all that processed, sugary stuff.<br /><br />I also like that this book is not full of a bunch of fillers that most of the other baby food books. Many were 1/3 to 1/2 of information before they even got to the recipes and who has time to read all that stuff.<br /><br />I love the simplicity of the recipes and the great suggestions like making toddler popsicles in ice cube trays - I always found that regular popsicle molds made way to much and it would just melt all over. These are the perfect size. This book also has lots of great cracker recipes which are so quick and easy to make and I don't have to worry about my baby eating hydrogenated oils and sugar. The smoothie recipes are awesome - who knew you could sneak veggies into a smoothie and it would taste so good.<br /><br />This book gives more than recipes. Some of the ideas are very simple but you don't always think of them on your own. I'm very happy I choose this book.	2003-12-29

All FOUR copies had binding problems. When I opened the book, the pages started to break off so the store is returning them all.<br />I am quite disappointed because it looks like a really good book content wise. Hope they get a new printing soon.	2003-12-10

I don't really like the format which is like a textbook for a cooking class but what really frustrated me is that the index isn't right. I looked up several things and was brought to a page that had something totally different.<br />The information on cooking methods and results was interesting but I wasn't that impressed with the recipes. A lot of them were very strange and said to be results of cooking class improvisation experiments. I would have preferred more basic and traditional recipes with just a few of the odd ones thrown in.	2003-11-04

The only problem I have with this book is that it seems that the recipes were not tested. The first two recipes I tried did not work they way there were written which makes me hesitant to try any others. Another thing that makes me feel that perhaps these weren't tested is that there are no recipes yields so you don't know how many of a cookie your making or how many servings a recipe will make.	2003-09-23

I was turned off right away by a bunch of woman complaining about how badly life and particularly men had treated them. The rest of the book was more of the same - lots of &quot;poor me&quot; and wallowing in self pity. I did not find any of the characters likeable or endearing even though we were constanly told how wonderful and special they were.<br />I didn't find the writing particularly good and I thought it ridiculous that the whole world would be moved by a bunch of woman abandoning their lives to walk. This is definitely a book to miss.	2003-08-29

Although the subject matter was painful, I couldn't help loving and rooting for the main character. She was so funny and sarcastic, you just couldn't wait to hear what she would say next. On the other hand, you dreaded what she might do next. I could not put this book down but when it was over, I wanted more. I certainly hope to read more from this author.	2003-05-09

In each chapter, Hill gives just enough information to reel you in a little tighter but always leaves you wanting more.<br />This book shows both sides of this disturbing case - you feel the pain of the victim's family as well as the suspects family. The plot is very plausable - it is easy to see how one event led to the next but you never know what that next event will be.<br />I've enjoyed Hill's nonfiction books, but her fiction is even better. I can't wait for her next book.	2003-04-19

Though the first chapter was more like a travel journal, the story became engrossing when grandmother's story took over. Though the writing is somewhat amatuerish at times, the story is none-the-less emotional and compelling. I learned a lot about life in Korea - a life we in America could not imagine. I heartily recommend this story of courage.	2003-03-17

It really inspired me and want to do something for someone to see if maybe it would work. I appreciated that the plan got off to a rocky start which seemed realistic. The characters were a bit shallow - Trevor a little to good to be true, mother a little to typical, teacher typical chip on his shoulder man but it didn't stop me from enjoying the story.	2003-02-15

The recipes are easy, straightfoward, use familiar ingredients and every dish I have tried has come out perfectly. He includes a nice selection of vegan recipes which are nice to have since many vegetarian cookbooks use so much dairy.	2003-02-10

I kept waiting for it to be as good as the jacket professed but it just got worse. There were so many flashbacks, it was hard to stay with the story (which was not too interesting anyway). The book was preachy, characters were uninteresting and flat, motivation was unclear. I don't recommend this at all.	2003-02-09

Especially for first-time breastfeeders who may feel unsure about how to nurse, this book will help you feel comfortable and so nursing becomes the magical, wonderful experience it should be. This is a great shower gift too!	2003-02-08

The two stories told simultaneously added to the dream-like quality of the book. The adult story starts with an idyllicallic life that slowly spirals into a nightmare to close the circle of betrayal from past actions. It was haunting. The only problem I had was with the teenager story - the main character was my age and I know we didn't say things like &quot;go girl&quot; and &quot;girlfriend&quot; when I was a teenager and there was no such thing as Sunny Delight back then.	2003-02-07

As a busy mother, I don't think I would take the time to make most of these dishes except maybe on special occasions.	2003-02-07

The recipes are relatively easy and the author lists easily found substitutes for hard-to-find authentic thai ingredients. The only problem I have is with the layout of the book. It is organized by region which is nice in the sense that you can read about the region and see what they eat but for practicality, I would prefer appetizers, entrees, noodle dishes, desserts etc. grouped together.	2003-02-07

The love to yell \\"muncha, muncha, muncha\\" as the bunnies raid Mr. McGreeley's garden. We laugh as each method he tries becomes more elaborate. The easy words and repetition makes this fun for toddlers too.	2003-02-03

Sandra Cisneros paints pictures with words that make me feel like I am there with the Reyes family. I love the narrator Lala. I love her quirky family that is everybody's family. I enjoyed learning about mexican culture and lifesytle and what it is like for mexican-americans. I can't wait to read more of Sandra's books.	2003-01-30

I was a little disappointed in this one. It was enjoyable but seemed to be lacking her usual magic. I think this would be perfect as a YA book. Teenagers would enjoy and learn from this book. It just seemed a bit too juvenile and simple for an adult read.	2003-01-27

We got if from the library and she had me read it 4 or 5 times a day. She giggled like crazy to see the little lamb with the pretty name Delilah sitting at the breakfast table, collecting eggs and riding the tractor. We live on a farm so it was especially amusing. Although the vocabulary and story length is geared to a slightly older child, she followed the story fine and learned a few new words. The adorable pictures make this a fun book for any age.	2003-01-16

My girls and I laughed through it - the funniest part was that it is almost like our house. My husband brings home a different animal every week and they are always getting into everything. I also liked that the woman bought brown rice and lots of healthy food - nice to see in children's books.	2003-01-09

I loved that it was about an middle-aged (or a little over) woman and thought it really protrayed the way, we are never grown up when we're around our family. I was a little bothered by the inconsistencies in Grant - the love interest but otherwise found this a perfect, light read.	2003-01-09

Anytime I made one of these soups, customers would rave. The recipes are easy to make, don't need tons of ingredients, they are not overcooked, they are light but filling and delicious - I am especially fond of their soups. I recommend this cookbook to everyone I know. Vegans and non vegans love it.	2003-01-06

I couldn't get him out of his shop. He found out what kind of wood to buy, how to use his new saw, and he made the coolest puzzles - much more original than anything I've seen in stores. The kids love their puzzles and play with them all day. I can't wait to see what else he creates from this book.	2003-01-06

I moved from the east coast to California about 6 years ago and I have been wanting to cook more californian. What a great resource this is to learn not only the recipes but the history of each dish. The stories are interesting, the recipes look relatively easy. I can't wait to start experimenting. I am especially looking foward to homemade tortillas. The only reason I didn't give this a five star rating is because a lot of the recipes are deep fried.	2002-12-16

It has an engaging and humorous story, wonderful illustrations, and an excellent message. It is appropriate for a wide range of ages - my 3 year old loves it but it is about a girl in first grade so older children will relate to it. The message that what is inside a person is more important than what she looks like is something I want my daughters to believe. Molly Lou Melon is such a likeable and wonderful character that we all fell in love with her. It is truly an excellent book!	2002-06-09
