The title leads me to believe I wouldn't get much from it, but I was very mistaken. I found myself underlining passages and writing notes in the margins. West details a very compelling argument. His theory is since it appears the people with literary disabilities have superior visual/spatial skills, these skills may often be mutually exclusive. Hence, people with superior literary skills often have poor visual/spatial skills. He postulates that since human society has only been post-literate for hundreds of years compared to pre-literate for thousand of years, people with better visual/spatial skills would have a survival advantage as better hunter/gatherers and avoid other dangers. People with superior literary skills in a pre-literate society would have poor survival skills although they would be needed as say shamans, storytellers or record-keepers. The theory makes sense evolutionarily as it seems to confirm Shaywitz's observation that 1 in 5 people have some reading disability. Which at the time seemed high to me. West goes on to argue that society has been selecting against people with poor literary skills and details the danger this can pose. He argues it appears that society is turning back to needing people with high visual/spatial skills with the advent of cheap highly graphic computers and other visual modes of information communication. West details several famous (Einstein, Churchill, and Edison) and not-so-famous people (Faraday, Tesla and Maxwell) with literary disabilities but superior visual/spatial skills and how their skills were important for their success. I feel that dyslexics, educators, and policy makers should read this book. West makes a very persuasive argument that society should not select for only one skill set because you never know what skills a future society may need. In an aside, the film Gattaca uses West's theory as a basis of the plot even mentioning how Einstein was dyslexic. If you find this book compelling, you will enjoy the film.	2003-05-30
US	52868401	R23EDS4RJMB2Q3	8489954135	425277872	The Story of Spain	Books	5	41	45	N	Y	Very good overview	I got this book to prepare for a tourist trip to Spain. It gives a very good overview of the history of Spain starting from prehistoric times up to about the mid-1990's. The more modern history is understandably rather cursory. The Spanish Civil War was a bit confusing with the multiple political parties and really requires it's own book to understand. The author gives a small biography on each time period for futher reading. The best feature of this book is that after each chapter the author gives tourist sites related to each historic period. For example after the Roman history chapter, he lists sites with Roman ruins and how it relates to what you just read. This makes the book a good reference to bring along on the trip. It you plan a tourist trip to Spain and only have time for one book, this would be the one to pick up.	2003-05-12

I could never understand why I scored average to low in multiple-choice tests but scored high in reading comprehension. Why I excelled in physical science and math yet was constantly taking remedial writing and English? Dr. Shaywitz's book is excellent in answering these questions. The first step in treatment is understanding the mechanism. A miswiring of the phonologic module explains so much and suggests likely remedies. Her book is written in layman's terms and is easy to read and understand. I wish I could give a copy of this book to all my friends and family it explains so much. Dr. Shaywitz knows her audience and writes with compassion and personal touch. The best part was learning that dyslexia can now be seen to have a physical manifestation by fMRI. Dyslexia is no longer a mysterious disability but has  actual biological roots. Most disturbing to read was that in her estimates, 1 in 5 children have some form of dyslexia. As a child that almost slipped through the cracks, I failed kindergarten because I didn't know my ABC's, this is distressing to learn. How many intelligent and potentially successful adults were allowed to fail due to dyslexia? It was only through the diligence of my mother that I ever learned to read. Thirty years ago little was understood about \\"word blindness\\" but my mother did the primary research and tried every goofy theory on teaching including writing letters on my back with her finger and asking me to name the letter. Now Dr. Shaywitz gives good advice as well as current research and resources so parents have it all in one book. If you had only one book on dyslexia this would be it. I can't recommend this book highly enough. I give it many more stars then I'm allowed.	2003-04-28

This story is told from the point of view of three characters; a police officer assigned to find a murderer, a friend of the murderer, and a therapist assigned to examine the murder. Another story line about a robot mission to a planet in another galaxy is thrown in. The stories are loosely connected but really go in different directions. It's really three short stories thrown together. The story about the police officer was the most interesting followed by the therapist's. The friend's story was the most boring. None of the stories really have much of a resolution. Overall, it seems Bear was trying to say something about the nature of sentiency. However, I wasn't able to determine exactly what he was trying to say about it. I can't recommend this book because the author's message seems to be lost and the stories are only moderately interesting in their own right.	2001-08-06

I've read Kenyon's `The Seeds of Time' and found it fairly entertaining.  I was very disappointed with this book. The character development was adequate. The book description makes it sound very exciting and profound. It was none of these although it could have been. The major revelation is glossed over and a reader can almost miss it. The plot deals mainly with the aliens' political intrigues that are almost too human. Why they do what they do seems to make no sense. The girl is secondary to the story and certainly no warrior as the book description portrays. She manages to stay alive on a world where everything seems to eat everything else. Harry Harrison's `Deathworld' comes to mind. The overall problem seems to be that events in the book unfold without any background. It's almost as if the reader is expected to know what happened to cause the events lending up to the climax. There are several stories and plotlines occurring in this book that really need several books to cover adequately. It's almost as if this book is a synopsis of a whole series.  As a result this is a book with huge possibilities that falls flat due to lack of content.	2001-07-06

The world Burns creates is extremely interesting and funny in a 'Snow Crash' sort of way. All the characters are very bizarre and you just want to know more about them. You put together Jamal, a black, over weight, omnipotent agoraphobic computer whiz; his girlfriend Amber, an Asian tabooed nymphomaniac; Dan, the 'Virtual Weatherman' with a celebrity ex-wife from Hell and a butch lesbian, biker, producer; Martina, a Russian, amazon, one-woman-army, bodyguard guarding her boyfriend the head of the United Nations; Davsheed, a gay Pakistani-American `Media Artist' working for the UN and his Native-American UN security guard boyfriend; Jane the pilot/commander of a mission to Mars with a egotistical, back-stabbing second-in-command; Ray Sunshine a charismatic televangelist; throw in some nationalistic, multi-phobic white supremacists and you get one hell of a story.  If great characters isn't enough, put in a fun story where many of these characters try to get together to save an alien living on a Martian moon and you can't miss. Finally give the story a feel good message about love makes this even more enjoyable. For a funny, feel-good story with fantastic characters you must read this book.	2001-05-31

Asaro keeps the ending a mystery almost to the very end. Once she reveals the 'who dun'it' the plot barrels along with almost no sense. Characters acting with seemingly one motivation suddenly reverse course. Minor characters become major factors etc. Overall a book that I wouldn't read again, but makes a good book to pass the time on say a long plane flight.	2001-05-29

I don't often give SF a top rating, but this is the best SF I've read in a while. It was everything I enjoy in a SF novel. An interesting world/future to explore, interesting realistic people, and a great story with plot twists that had me guessing till the very last chapter. The book even has a message/moral that I find compelling. It made me think about my role in society as a scientist. I eagerly await her next novel and highly recommend this one to anyone. Here is an author to keep your eyes on.	2001-05-26

The essays are written in a variety of styles, from straight narrative to a kind of stream of consciousness. One style written as if the writer is dictating his thoughts while climbing is used several times. At first it was interesting, but the later essays written in this style lose their novelty. Pritchard's essays are relatively short and cover a wide variety of subjects, from specific climbs, whole expeditions to people. Most of his stories about people were written after their death in one climbing accident or another. One essay about a climber with a career ending injury and how he deals with it is prophetic considering Pritchard's recent possible career ending climbing accident. Overall, it is easy to see why this book won the Boardman-Tasker award for climbing literature. The variety of the subjects and writing styles makes this a very good anthology of climbing essays that every climber should have in their library.	2001-05-21

The main character's very vague mission is to study the planet and the society that develops there. All this takes place with the background plot of a weak love story and a civil war. I found the descriptions of the 'ecoi' very interesting and enjoy that kind of writing. It's too bad he couldn't think of a plot, other than the main character wandering around describing things, to go with it. A book I would read once and will never pick it up again.	2001-05-21

The first half of the book is a condensed version of the stories, told within the context of another story (ie. flashbacks), that follow in the second half. This isn't hard science. The stories drive the interest along. The stories deal with different consequences of psychic-like abilities and the ability to 'sleep' through centuries to wake up in a future time. Overall, all the stories are very good and explain a different aspect of the world Card is trying to create. Highly recommended.	2001-04-13

It was a short introduction on tips for RV cooking. Overall some good general tips, but nothing that probably isn't in a good trade magazine. As an experienced camping and backpacking cook I was hoping for information on RV cooking now that I have a refrigerator. It does give some good recipes that utilize the better facilities of an RV. However about half the recipes assume you have an oven as well. My small Class B RV doesn't have an oven. Therefore, half the book is useless for me. Overall a slightly disappointing book that I wish I had looked over before purchasing.	2001-03-16

A quarter of the book is taken up in a scientific mystery plot much like a Robin Cook novel, which are even given a short plug in the book. I found the characters interesting and their underlying psychology believable, however some of their actions in terms of their relationships with each other I found a little farfetched. The story has an antagonist that you just love to hate especially if you ever had to deal with office politics in a scientific laboratory. A very enjoyable read that kept the suspense going the whole way through the book, which made it hard to put down. I would classify this as a thinker's Sci-Fi, in that a reader has to keep most of their brain cells functioning to enjoy this book. Overall, I recommend this book as worth a read especially for a scientist or fan of hard science.	2001-03-12

The action moves fast and furious. Although it did have a &quot;poof&quot; magical ending, I enjoyed reading it. This combined with the first two sections of the book would have made an excellent series. The middle sections definitely dragged the series out longer than it had to be. A series that I read a bit at a time. A good time killer, but not a series that I absolutely couldn't have done without.	2001-03-02

Card continues to do this with Ender's Shadow. Even classic series such as the Dune universe start to get boring by the 4th book. Card is able to tell the same story from a different and interesting view point. Even though the main plot is known to most readers, this story of Bean holds its interest. You will definitely enjoy this book if you liked Ender's Game.	2001-01-15

This book is the story of a real U-Boat commander and it will just blow you away. It's incredible the nerves of steel these guys had. All most every passage had me thinking, 'That is just unbelievable.' This book is a fascinating story of the life of a U-boat commander both on and off the boat. A very interesting views into the mentality of both the German military and people at the time. I can't recommend this book enough. A must for anyone interested in the time period or military history.	2000-12-11

The book follows two parallel story lines, one for the humans and one for the aliens. The story lines converge at the end for the exciting finish. Both story lines keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense. The science was adequate with decently developed characters. The only problem I had with the book was the improbable surprise ending that seemed a little rushed to end the novel in a timely manner. Otherwise, I would highly recommend this to any science fiction fan.	2000-12-07
US	52868401	R37MDSWCU4X75U	1573226521	117734468	The Beach	Books	3	1	4	N	N	Average	This book is a very quick and enjoyable read. The only reason I even considered reading this book is because I'm going to Thailand for 3 weeks and a friend mentioned that the movie was filmed in the area we'll be staying. It was fun to read about some of the places we'll be. I got the feeling that the author was trying to write `Lord of the Flies' for the X-generation. The best way to describe the book is a cross between `Lord of the Flies', `Apocalypse Now' and every other Vietnam movie made. The author makes many references to Vietnam. I haven't seen the film yet, but I think this could make a better film script than a book. The first third of the book was very interesting as the author sets up the environment. The middle gets a little bogged down especially as the main character has weird conversations with his conscience in the form of another character that dies early in the book. I got the feeling that the author was trying to say something deep about human nature, society, etc, but it doesn't come across. The ending was very exciting and would make a good film ending, but in the book it wasn't a surprise. From about half way though the book I knew what was going to happen the only question was who was going to die and who wasn't. Overall, I only enjoyed the book because it's about an area that I'm going to visit. As a reader born one year before the author, I didn't find that he had anything profound to tell me about my generation although it certainly seems like he tried.  I would only recommend this to people either visiting or returning from Thailand it has very little to offer other than a decent story.	2000-11-20

The story was somewhat predictable. I picked up this book thinking I'd get more of the same. You do get more of Hamilton's interesting world, especially a history of how the social groups and technology he describes in his epic series come about.  However, the stories are anything but predictable. Every single story, I thought I had figured out and there would be no more surprises, turned out to have a twist at the end that completely astonished me. It was great being fooled each time.  I highly recommend this one to everyone even readers that didn't like his epic series. I think tech and story fans alike will enjoy this one.	2000-11-13

You get a better feeling for how the book is laid out after listening to the author's lecture style. An organic chemist by training, the author naturally gears this book to the organic chemist. He gives just enough physiology to understand the pharmacology behind it. The book follows his lecture course fairly well with more in-depth discussion on topics of interest. A standard reference text that should be in any chemists' library starting out in the pharmaceutical field.	2000-11-13

The parallels are too strong. I'm sure the author used it as a basis for the plot, characters and background. I agree with another review that the author loves to use flowery adjectives and prose that at times gets in the way of the narrative. At times I was thinking, 'Just get on with it.' But after a couple of chapters, I got used to the style and just got into the flow of the novel. The book has a weak ending, with an ambiguous resolution, but I liked the author's style, it was different. I have to say though, I don't think I'll read another by this author. I like a little more substance behind all the artful use of language.	2000-10-16

Blum just describes the major events and issues. She skips over minute stuff that a lot of other expedition books tend to bog down in. Chris Bonington comes to mind. Blum writes very well, unusual for a mountaineer, and kept me interested thorough out the book. I usually don't get sentimental, but even I felt a pull at the heartstrings.

A decent biography of Barber although it was published when he was only  28. It's hard to imagine such a prolific climber fading away at such a  young age, you don't hear about him much now-a-days. This book isn't really  written in chronological order and each chapter really can almost stand  alone. Details his trips to Austraila and Germany the best. Gives insight  into the statement I hear often climbing, 'Oh, that's a Henry Barber  route,' which mean that it was probably hard. A must read for any Northeast  based climber.	2000-09-07

Although the author gives details of Osman's life, the book is really about  the author's own journey; balancing his risk-taking activities with family  responsibilities and his relationship with Dan Osman. The Phantom Lord is a  metaphor the author uses for one's own fear; ie the book is about the  author and Osman dealing with their fears. Therefore, the book is half  about Osman and half about the author. For what it delivers, the book is  very well written. In retrospect to Osman's subsequent death, it is very  interesting. If you are uninterested in the author's journey, as I was, the  sections where he talks about himself are easily skipped. The parts, about  Osman, that I found interesting are fairly short and I'd recommend climbers  to borrow it. He spends quite a number of pages explaining various climbing  terms; therefore, I'd also recommend it to the general reader for its  excellent writing.	2000-09-05

The grammatical/spelling  errors aside, I like the style of the book. The author uses mostly  Beverly's letters to her parents to tell her story. Beverly wrote some  truly amazing letters. Her sense of humor, fun and outlook toward life  comes thorough. Some interviews with friends after her death are also  included. The author only touches on Beverly's life as a climber; after  reading this book you can see was only one aspect of her life. Beverly  comes across as a amazing woman someone whos lifestyle many can admire. I  think a must read for any woman in a male dominating sport or activity.	2000-09-04

Terms I hadn't heard  since I was 16 playing Dungeons and Dragons; hit points, lawful good, etc.  I was expecting a mystery/adventure plot, but got a fantasy adventure.  Because the main action takes place in virtual reality, I failed to see the  urgency of the characters situation. Couldn't they make their world  whatever they wanted? Unlike other VR novels where people could die if you  died in VR. Not the case here. The main characters spend there time killing  virtual dragons, trolls, loch ness monsters, evil elves and harpies. I  found all this very boring. I think only teenagers and preteens would enjoy  this book. Most adults I think would find it boring. Hence only a one star  for me.	2000-08-31

The author deals more in broad Chinese influences than specific  ones, although he does discuss specific events. About half the book covers  the time period after 1951 to the late 80's and should have stuck with  that. Smith uses mainly secondary sources, like Goldstein, for events  before 1951 and primary sources for events after. Goldstein gives a much  better history of Tibet up to the Chinese `liberation.' The book is in  extension of Smith's thesis and reads a bit like it. He includes extended  quotes. It's much harder to read, follow and maintain interest. Smith is  obviously very pro-Tibetan, as am I, but this tends to make me a little  skeptical in my reading of this book especially when he starts to argue  over numbers. Overall, I thought this was a decent book especially for the  more recent events in Tibet, but I tend to be a little skeptical of Smith's  analysis.	2000-08-07

Goldstein writes an extremely readable book. He covers a large time period using primary sources and interviews with the characters involved. He  limits his analysis of the events and lets the readers examine the  evidence. He gives evidence of the Tibetan government's faults as well as  the abandonment of Tibet by the international community. This book is a  must read for anyone trying to understand the current efforts of the  Tibetan government in exile. `Orphans of the Cold War: America and the  Tibetan Struggle for Survival' by John Kenneth Knaus is also an excellent  book that covers the US government's involvement with Tibet and gives extra  insight to the information given by Goldstein.	2000-07-17

A story told from multiple points of view, it reminded me of the style used in the film 'Pulp Fiction', through a large period of time. The author uses different  character narration to examine one pivotal event in the book. This book is  really a mystery. After every chapter it had me asking what the hell is  going on and what is going to happen next. I didn't find any weaknesses in  this book. A well told-story from start to finish. No wonder it was  nominated for so many awards. I'm surprised it didn't win any. I highly  recommend this one.	2000-06-30
US	52868401	R6DREPB1HQ54T	0345407865	661421702	The Children of Henry VIII	Books	5	3	4	N	Y	Her best	In my opinion this is book is her best in the series. The title I think is misleading a bit. The book mainly deals mostly with King Edward and Queen Mary. Of course, she deals with Queen Elizabeth more than adequately in her  next book. This book is an excellent bridge between 'The Wives of Henry the  VIII' and 'Elizabeth I'. The attempted coups, rebellions and assassinations  in interesting stuff. A must read.	2000-06-05

There were more noticeable plot elements that were hard to buy. One thing I found particularly unbelievable was the character of Bruce. In the first book, he  is portrayed as a caring, understanding and giving person who doesn't judge  the Tendu on human values. In this book his character does a complete 180.  He's a selfish, close-minded, bigoted jerk. This Jekyll and Hyde  personality was distracting and has hard for me to swallow. I felt like  smacking the character on the head. I guess this change was required for  plot. <br />The implications of Tendus' ability to heal and extend lifetime on  human society was touched on by the author, however, I think the impact of  the Tendu was downplayed much more than would be the case. Overall, this  book makes a good follow-up and worthy of a read. Several plot lines remain  open for a possible continuation.	2000-05-09

But they were so substantially different from each other which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I liked the differences, but the novel got a little weird toward the end with some  dream like sequences that I didn't understand and I usually don't care for  dream scenes. If you are expecting a more in-depth version of the film you  get a little of that, but they are so different that you may not like it.	2000-04-03

I've read all of the books in Weir's series, except 'The Children of Henry the VIII, on the English monarchy and they are all excellent. This one is informative, however it did drag on at times. I think she spent a little too much time on each wife and by the 5th, I was wishing she'd just get on  with it.  Weir's approach is to look at the personalities of the  individuals involved and how that affected their actions and ultimately  history.	2000-04-02

A proper amount of color to help organize phrases and sections without being overwhelming. Just the right amount of material was  presented unlike a lot of phrase books which try to give you every possible  situation, this one gave only what is most common. It also gave any major  difference in Spanish between various Latin American countries. Although  there is a phonetic guide, all the phrases are also given phonetically, for  the American English speaker, right below. I used this for a trip to Mexico  for 10 days and never ran into a situation this book couldn't help me with.  When I had trouble with my pronunciation, I could always point to the  phrase. The font was big enough to see it clearly without straining, but  small enough that that whole thing fit easily in my back pocket. A must  have for any trip to Latin America.	2000-03-30

A Survival Guide to Customs & Etiquette)	Books	4	14	15	N	N	Social and Cultural Mexico	I read this after reading the US State Travel Dept. Info Sheet which tends to be overly conservative and makes places sound like demilitarized zones. This guide put a little reality back into it. The author gives some  cultural tips mainly for the gringo (US citizen) to help mostly in social  situations. Especially useful, were the tips on how to recognize a good  Mexican restaurant, how to address people in social situations, and other  Mexicanisms such as various commonly used slang. The author also describes  regional differences and urban/rural differences you may come across. I  feel this is a good guide to get a feel for the people and the place  especially for the casual visitor going to the non-tourist areas of Mexico  so you don't act like such a gringo. Not really a book to keep as a  long-term reference to Mexico, I'd try to borrow it before buying it. The  author does give minor Mexican differences in pronouncing Spanish, but I  think he assumes most readers have a basis for Spanish, or will have a  phrase book for this.	2000-03-29

I remember peeling back layers till I got to the middle and didn't find anything, but then realizing I was looking in the wrong place.  Each chapter reveals another aspect of the main character's personality.  Spider's character becomes more solid with each chapter. There's a lot of  meaning in the conclusion.  What the author is trying to say is difficult  to determine but what ever it is, it is certainly profound. I'm still  digesting this novel. It's the kind of book that keeps you thinking long  after having read it. Certainly one that will give you new insight the  second, third, etc., time you read it. Recommended.	2000-03-21

I give it the highest rating for this. However, the rating comes down in the last chapter, which gets weird with  strange dream like sequences that I don't care for much. This is the type  of book you read in college where you have to try to analyze everything the  author is trying to say. I'm not sure what it was. For example, I'm not  sure what the title is referring too. I'm also not sure what the power  struggle was all about. The author seems to try to convey great  significance to an event that seemed trivial to me. The back cover credits  compare this author to Phillip K. Dick, but except for the weird dream  sequences, Reed's writing is much better. This book reminded me a lot of  Vonnegut's Slaughter House Five. The same sort of time travel weirdness and  symbolism with great writing. So an average rating for great  characterization and scene but a general weirdness that I don't care for.	2000-02-17
US	52868401	R2PUHYU02OWGEX	0345391780	608322438	The Princes in the Tower	Books	4	3	7	N	Y	Circumstantial	Although I find the evidence circumstantial I find the theory highly plausible. As the author admits herself her aim isn't to prove Richard guilty. She isn't a jury and isn't trying to prove his guilt in a court of  law. She is trying to come to a plausible account of what happened. Given  that it was acceptable to kill one's rivals for political advancement I  find her theory acceptable although not proven. Although I think OJ did it,  I agree with the verdict of not guilty. The evidence was too  circumstantial. Same case here.	2000-02-15

Something to do with the reproducing cycle of Sira. It does make you want  to read the sequel if just to figure out what was going on it this book.  Which I suppose a first book in a series should do. Overall, I give it a  average rating. Not a book I'd read over and over again.	2000-02-15

The author explains more that helps to explain what was going on in the first book. However, now I'm not sure what was going on in this book. Exactly what the Drapsk are looking for is  unclear and even they admit they don't know what it is. The M'hir and its  nature is still confusing even more so now. I suspect a trend where you  have to read the next book in the series to figure out what went on in the  previous one. Which I suppose is a good thing in a series, if not just a  bit frustrating.	2000-02-15
US	52868401	R2Y0ERWMII3Q6V	0345404335	46057174	The Wars of the Roses	Books	4	8	12	N	Y	Ditto	An entertaining story that tells of the Wars of the Roses from a more personality driven aspect.  This book is ann excellent way to learn about this historical period.  The only problem I had with the book is that Weir, sometimes switches back and forth between using peoples given names and  their titles.  I guess this is a difficult think to avoid because first  sons were often named after the father and titles were transferred only  after the previous holder died.  Conveniently, Weir includes a genealogy,  but even still it is sometimes difficult to keep track of the characters.  The nature of the beast, I guess, I haven't read a royal history yet that I  don't get the characters confused halfway thorough.	2000-01-26

The characters are multi-dimensional and their motives change as circumstances change. Every character had an interesting personality. Most SF characters are very one  dimensional (ie. good guy, bad guy, greedy, altruistic, etc.) Well's  blended these and other traits to make very realistic characters. The plot  was interesting with a surprise twist ending that I liked a lot. The  theocracy was a bit too unrealistic for me but worked in the context of the  story. Finally the sex was not nearly as gratuitous as the author likes to  make it out to be. The sex scenes fit in very well with the story and  seemed appropriate.	1999-12-21

The characters drives and motives were a bit one dimensional. There were no real surprises in the plot. Just a battle of survival between similar life forms. It would have  been interesting to get some kind of motive for the Enemy. The Enemy acted  like a unthinking monster for the most part just going around eating  people.	1999-12-21

The author only spends one chapter to his personal involvement with the Tibetan resistance, the rest is the interesting  political maneuvering done it the time period. The author spent several  years interviewing many of the principal characters and researching the  available archives. Just about every statement the author makes is backed  up by a primary source. The author makes a very good attempt at an  objective portrayal of the events described although his main sources,  understandably, come from Tibetan, Indian and western sources. The Chinese  view comes mainly from published speeches. This book is also a good source  to other books about Tibet. One book by Sydney Wignall, 'Spy on the Roof of  the World' is also a interesting account of Chinese/Tibetan relations in  1957.	1999-12-14

This seems to be a little misleading as people change over the years. The  endless courtships does get tedious at times but other aspects of her life,  the political intrigue, more than makes up for it. Particularly interesting  is Weir's psychological theories on why Liz acted as she did. On a nitpick  issue, the paperback has an unusually thin cover that curled like crazy. I  recommend the hardcover version instead.	1999-11-30

An incredible man of his time who coined the term safari.  The first half drags a bit as it  details his early life in India, however, his descriptions of his travels  though Arabia and Africa more than make up for it.  The author tends to  have a favorable view toward Burton, a disfavored view toward his  distracters and Burton's wife.  Burton was a product of his times and  although he believed in a rigid social order concerning the races, that  would be considered racist today, he abhorred slavery.  He also talked  rather openly about sex in a time of strong Victorian morals that  suppressed open sexuality.	1999-11-29

Since she was only on the scene for about 2 years this is a good way of presenting  her life. A large cast of characters is presented and flipping back and  forth between the narrative and the micro-biographies is often required.  Even still, it is difficult to keep in mind all the different family  relationships and how it affected the characters actions. I throughly  enjoyed her story and its presentation. The only flaw I found was not much  was presented about her future canonization which I would have liked a  little more indepth discussion.	1999-11-22

The author's incredible story of survival after being illegally arrested is  captivating. The author also has a sharp wit and some of the lies he tells  the Chinese are hilarous.

The plot is interesting and plausible, however some aspects just don't ring true and that was distraction for me. Having read many actual accounts on climbing  Everest and other Himalayan peaks, weather is always the number factor.  Here the weather was perfect for 100 days in a row and didn't play a part  until the very end. Hardly plausible. Then a character has serious injuries  above 26,000 feet (shattered leg) and one other climber is able do the  rescue. It took half a dozen people to rescue Beck Weathers in 1994 on  Everest and he could at least walk. So other than a few reality problems, a  decent novel.	1999-11-08

At least the new title isbetter. The style is a attempt to recreate the style of an original 10th century manuscript simply boring. The only reason I got through it was because it was so short.

The major changes in the future seem to environmental remediation and debit cards inplanted in the hand. So much for fantasic visions of the future. The bioscience wasn't too far off from  what is possible today, and debit cards?, just about everyone has one now.  The story follows several plotlines and at times it was difficult to  understand how they related to each other. All the characters seem to be  gay and it throws off the balance. The story was heavy into co-dependence  which was interesting to a point, but quickly got boring. Finally, at the  end, two of the characters become lovers although it seemed like there was  no relationship forming, and suddenly there it was. Overall average.	1999-08-09

I don't think some of the historical figures would have acted as they did. The aliens are naive beyond belief. They just don't seem that bright. I  don't think they could successfully invade my grandmother's kitchen. The  aliens can somehow cross lightyears of space, but their technology doesn't  seem to be more advanced then that shown in the Gulf War. A worthy attempt  at an alternative history that just falls flat. I don't think I'll bother  finishing this series. Try Harry Harrison's East of Eden for a great  alternative history.	1999-08-04

Very little  'hard' science is involved although the author seems to have a adequate  grasp of basic physics. The meeting of the two alien cultures has very  interesting and the main character's search for the meaning of God was  enlightening. A very worthy read that was a bit weak on overall plot hence  4 rather than 5 stars.	1999-06-15

The vision of the future is interesting, typically dark. The characters are unbelieveable at times. One woman, for all practical purposes was a former Amish woman later  becomes extremely sophisticated in the ways of the world. This seems highly  unlikely. Overall a average read. I don't think I'll read any more in the  series. Mostly a detective series in the far future.	1999-06-09

It's sort of a mystery on who is doing what to whom. Who are the good guys and who are the bad? The best part of the whole book was the theories of one  character on what was going on. Sort of a Mother Earth type theory. Very  provacative.	1999-06-09

US	52868401	RH7M4FWSIVE5H	067172083X	13412921	Barrayar	Books	3	4	6	N	Y	Good adventure	The story in this book is dominated by the great characters. The author really gets into the characterizations. The characters feelings and motivations are described, but for all the touchy feeliness, there is still  more than enough action sequences to keep you entertained. As far as SF  goes, there is very little 'S' and much more 'F'. Take out the nerve  disruptors, hovercraft, and plasma guns the story could be set in 18th  Century Europe. It fact the society the story takes place in has lords,  peasants and a stratified class system. There are no strange cultural  elements in the story although alternative cultures are hinted at. This is  pretty much a straight forward adventure novel that reminded me a lot of  reading the 'Three Musketeers.' Overall average for what it delivers.	1999-05-19
US	52868401	R2I0R1LL1OZ5OY	0553576291	490357190	Deception Well	Books	1	3	3	N	Y	?	I found the book extremely difficult to follow. The author introduces past events and characters that define the present time setting, but how it all fits together is hard to figure out. The technology was so 'out there' that  it was hard to understand. Jargon and concepts were introduced that never  really got explained. How the society, it which the story takes place, came  about was really never explained. Somehow the society was split between  people over a hundred and under a hundred. How this arbitrary number came  about is anyones guess. As far a the story goes, what the heck is going  on!!! I get a vague idea, but then characters suddenly pop up that have  some stake it what's going on but why they do is again unclear. The plot  seems really inconsistent. Antagonists are suddenly allies then enemies  again. Don't even get me started on the main character's dream sequences.  Avoid this book if you want a clear, understandable plot and world.	1999-05-11

Since the author is a woman, it stands to reason, female characters are better developed. One main character, Al Shei, had a mix of traits I didn't buy. A  muslum woman that owns a spaceship and travels extensively without her  husband (.i.e very independent), 8 months at a time, yet her beliefs make  her wear a veil around male crew and do ridiculous things like adopting her  first mate so they can be in the same room together alone because he's male  and she's female. That just doesn't fit. A traditional muslum in the future  owning a spaceship doesn't make sence. The plot was reasonable, but the  exact nature of the threat is unclear as well as the resolution. The  descriptions of the network was enjoyable and plausable.	1999-04-15

The topos and pictures are clear and the descriptions are detailed. The author has probably done all the climbs so he should know. The topos even give specific gear needed at certain  places on the climb. Where the author's climbing style lays is obvious, he  seems to dislike anything with a chimney. Quality of routes are measured by  a 4 star system. The author uses R and X rating. This guide has everything  you could ask for. If you only want one guide to the area, this is it.	1999-03-25
US	52868401	R3F8HQI8M7TRRM	0553562738	466136665	Doomsday Book	Books	4	2	4	N	Y	Over characterization	I liked the premise of the book, however, I found the characters too stereotyped and unbelievable. You have the overbearing and overprotective mother, a overly incompetent back stabbing Assistant Head, a secretary that  complains constantly about a lack of toilet paper, visiting Americans that  obsess about missing their bell concert in the middle of a epidemic, a  Casanova undergraduate who seems to have a affair with every woman in the  book including much older nuns! The rest of the minor characters seem to be  living in a fantasy world without realizing what is going on. Only the two  major characters seem realistic. The plot of the story is okay, rescuing  the heroine from the past. The actual time the heroine spends in the past  is spent rather blandly, but I like the historical background. If you're  looking for a SF book this isn't it. Other than the fact that the story  occurs in the future and time travel is involved there is very little  science. The story runs on the plot of the rescue and I really wouldn't  call this an adventure novel. If you like history, especially Medieval  England, and fiction, you'll like this book. If you want believable  characters that you don't roll your eyes at every statement, avoid this  book.	1999-03-23
US	52868401	R5894ILT3T3LC	0446605115	177215083	Acts of Conscience	Books	2	1	7	N	Y	Oedipus in space	The plot deals with humans' lack of concern for other species and worlds. It deals with the rape of worlds much like we're doing to Earth. The author deals with the main characters sexual problems with seemed to me more of an  excuse to get a lot of sex scenes in. I like the alien characters he  portrays. You wish our race could be more like them. He gives the aliens  the more humane traits and the humans the more self-serving traits. The  author seems to be trying to say a lot about the environment and human  nature, but nothing that hasn't already been beaten into the ground it the  stereotypical fashion. I liked the premise of the plot, but the main  character sexual hang-ups distracted me. The story ended weakly with you  wishing for the alternative ending, especially as the humans were cast as  the evil character.	1999-03-16

I'm not very well versed in the area. Overall I wasn't able to understand what was going on, but individual scenes made sense. What I like most about this book was his use of language and the  bizarre flow of the book. I had to read aloud for the first half of the  book until my brain could cope with the style. As far as content, no wonder  muslims wanted to kill him. But, he takes pock shots at every other  religion too. I guess muslims don't have a sense of humor, or can't take a  joke.	1999-03-10

This seems to be the book that the movie K2 was based on. A lot of the characters and events are similar. Rowell gives a lot of historical background from other  expeditions to K2. Rowell writes this novel from his perspective, but he  also uses the diaries from the other expedition members to tell the story.  He also gives the perspective from the porters point of view, however, it  seems like he is mostly guessing what the porters feel and think and I've  never like that from a ethnographic point of view. Considering the trouble  the expedition had, it's a wonder that any of them wanted to return.  Some  of the best photographs of the region are shown.  Galen is great  photographer.	1999-03-08

Most books in the genre are fairly straight forward narratives of adventure, but Diemberger makes this one out to be some kind of  spiritual journey. He tends to wax eloquent more than I care for and makes  a prodigious use of metaphors. You can flip to any paragraph in the book  and find usual adjectives or metaphors. It seems every action he does has a  metaphor to climbing, everything from sailing to taking a plane flight.  Even something as simple as a meeting at a television studio becomes a  quest and a metaphor to climbing. The heavy use of some extremely flowery  adjectives may be due to the fact that this was originally written in  German and later translated to English. Possibly the translator had  something to do with it, but Diemberger speaks English, so I have my  doubts.   Diemberger is one of the few climber authors to admit that  attitude/fatigue could have affected his judgment and preception of events,  which is refreshing.  However, he goes to great lengths to discount other  peoples view of events, particular to make his climbing partner, Julie  Tullis, look good. He discounts some events as untrue, then in the next  paragraph describes what he just said didn't happen! One odd gap in the  story is their bivouac that Diemberger barely describes. They bivy, then  suddenly it's the next day. No description on how they passed the night.	1999-03-01

I has not disappointed. Some interesting aspects of Wiessner's personality are revealed. The story is basically the 1996  Everest expedition in 1939. A guided client dies due to poor, hypoxia  affected, decisions. This story proves the rule, 'history repeats itself'.  The fact that K2 was almost climbed, by practically one man, before nylon  ropes, Gore-Tex etc just boggles the mind. A truly amazing achievement.	1999-02-22
US	52868401	R1LM92BREMCT7M	0395485908	395398268	K2: Triumph and Tragedy	Books	3	24	27	N	Y	An overview of the 1986 K2 season	This book is another in the long list of books on epics in the high Himalayas.   This one covers the 1986 season on K2 where 13 people lost there lives. The author was a cinematographer with one of the expeditions.  He wasn't much of an athlete, he didn't know how to ski, and he didn't go  high on the mountain. So the story is told mostly from base camp and from  second hand stories by the climbers on the mountain. Therefore, exactly  what happened is unclear.  This always seems to be the case in these  stories because the preception of the characters is often clouded by  hypoxia. The 1939 American K2 expedition and the 1996 Everest season comes  to mind. Events, times and other occurrences get confused by everyone  involved.  Plus, with climbers, large egos are usually involved and no one  wishes to be criticized for their actions. Hypoxia makes one do strange  things high on a mountain and seemingly logical actions later make no  sense. This account is a overall account of what happened during that  season. The author probably recorded the events as he saw them accurately  because he never went too high on the mountain and was probably less  affected by hypoxia for that reason. However, his account also is limited  because he didn't go high and his view of the events, except for what went  on at base camp, was second hand. In particular a lot of his information  came from a Taiwanese expedition that always seemed to be wrong, possibly  due to a language barrier. A worthy read for overall background. Kurt  Diemberger's book, `The Endless Knot' may shed some light on the subject.   He was one of the two survivors of seven trapped high on K2 during an  extended storm. Again, the story may be hampered by hypoxia.	1999-02-22

I'm a long time Rat fan, but this is the first Rat novel in 8 years that I have read. Either my tastes have changed, or this one really blows.

It was a little hard to follow the flow of the battle in this account. I had trouble seeing the overall picture. The maps were vague and difficult to interpret. The best chapters were on the personality conflicts between  Eisenhower and Montgomery. The personal stories by individuals involved in  the battle were also very interesting.
