In an interesting touch, the author uses popular song titles of the era for his chapter headings. The one for MacArthur is very appropriate: \\"Too Marvelous for Words.\\"<br /><br />The cultural differences between the Australians and the Americans is, at first, something that both sides can learn from. After a time,it becomes apparent that the Americans are better paid and more popular with the Australian women, and skirmishes begin to break out. Then, a full-scale riot happens (The Battle of Brisbane). It takes some time before things calm down, but Australia was changed forever by the presence of the Americans.<br /><br />There are accounts of the different services, and how they performed in battle. I was glad to see the U.S. submarine force received an entire chapter, and even more surprised to find that one of the boats that my father served on in the Korean War was active in the fleet off Australia (I knew they had been in the Pacific, but had not known it had been that far south!).<br /><br />In all, a good read, and the only book that I've ever found on this subject.	2005-08-31

On their way back from their mission, they are attacked by the Japanese, and the ship sinks. No one knows where they are, and they are not listed as being out--they are floating in the open sea, and fall prey to sharks, and in some cases, their own madness. Only 317 crew members were alive at the end of their five day ordeal.<br /><br />It's a book of courage, and a testament to the sailors. It's also a damming account of the ineptness of the US Navy in the worst naval disaster in US history.	2005-08-31

This has to be one of the most original memoirs of WWII that I've come across. Lynton's prose is striking, balancing sarcasm and acidity effortlessly with the horrible events that he witnessed and participated in, and some of the most comical moments of a lifetime.

I had hoped to learn more about the women in Lincoln's life, but as it turns out, the author is related to Ann Rutledge (supposedly the love of Lincoln's life), and the author spends way too much time telling us how wonderful she was. He keeps bringing her name up in other contexts (\\"If Ann had been alive...\\" and so forth), and you'd almost expect that he would suggest that she be cannonized as a saint. It gets rather tedious, to say the least.<br /><br />Consequently, many other women that he met (such as Sojourner Truth) get mere mention or a few paragraphs, and of course, Mary Todd Lincoln is portrayed as an absolute nutcase.<br /><br />It's a shame--this could have been a great book.	2005-06-25

Rabbi Eichhorn's letters and diary entries portray a family man, soldier and rabbi. The book gives you not just a memoir of the war, but insights into his personal life (letters to his family), his own journals (detailed and much more frank about the war), and finally, reports to various Jewish agencies and the Army (the most disturbing ones of all). How he managed to experience all of this, and still retain his sanity and faith is astonishing.

His tales of ghosts and horror are like no other, and one story in particular, \\"An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge,\\" is considered to be, in some circles, a classic.<br /><br />Bierce's writings are also an acquired taste -- one gets the impression that he knew a bit about what he wrote: inner torment and a feeling of unsettlement. The preface to the book is very illuminating, giving us some insight into his personal life, which was then translated into these tales. Personally, I find them fascinating, but others may not.

Doyle deals with strange happenings including ghosts, a mystery set on a whaling ship, Egyptian mummies, and even Doyle's own solution to the \\"Marie Celeste\\" mystery.<br /><br />These are tales of mystery, the occult and imagination.

During that time, Phineas, who is an athlete, and Gene, who is an intellectual student, decide to jump from a tree into a river. Phineas, the great athlete, is injured and Gene feels responsible for the accident. Phineas then decides that he is going to train Gene to be the athlete that Phineas was. Gene, in the back of his mind, blames himself for what happened to his friend; in fact, he believes that he caused it on purpose. Relations between the two boys becomes strained, and things begin happening that change their group of friends, and nothing will ever be the same again.<br /><br />It's a good story, but wordy, capturing the atmosphere at a boy's school during WWII, and the effect that the war has on these young men.	2004-10-07

And, I'm not saying that because I am a great Bogart/Bacall fan, but because Betty (Ms. Bacall's real name) can write--this is one great book!<br /><br /> It's not a drag out all the dirty laundry type of book--it's a straightforward look back at her life as a Jewish girl from Brooklyn who came from a broken home, fiercely loved by her mother and her extended family. Far from being a stage mother, Betty's mother, Natalie, helped her daughter get the things she wanted, by hard work and sacrifice.<br /><br /> After a short modeling career, Betty was discovered by director Howard Hawks' wife, Slim, and Betty was under personal contract. She was slated to star in &quot;To Have and Have Not,&quot; and there met the man she'd later marry--Humphrey Bogart. Her years with him are best described by Betty, and it's so sad that Bogie died too soon--I think they would have been a couple that grew old together.<br /><br /> After Bogie's death, her life and career were in a state of flux for some time--an affair with Sinatra, her short-lived marriage to Jason Robards, and her decision to go it alone. She finds success on Broadway, and a rebirth happens--she's back in the spotlight, where she so rightfully belongs.<br /><br /> I recommend this book highly, along with her sequel: &quot;Lauren Bacall: Now.&quot; A classy dame, and as Bogie once said: &quot;She's a real Joe. You'll fall in love with her like everyone else.&quot;	2004-07-25

After becoming immersed in his faith after his father's death, Cady decides to write a book called The Holocaust. In it, he accuses a surgeon, Dr. Adam Kelno, as being one of the doctors at the Jadwiga camp that did experiments on other human beings and was a war criminal. Dr. Kelno finds out about the book, reads it, and decides to sue Cady in court and prove that Cady is a liar.

It was the first Arthur Miller play I ever saw performed on stage, and it is also a chilling comparison between the past and present.<br />Miller uses the Salem witch trials as the setting of his play, but it is actually play of its time. Written during the McCarthy Era, a witch-hunt of a different kind, Miller uses the Salem witch trials to illustrate what was happening (and is still happening) in the USA. &quot;Guilt by association&quot; is the order of the day, civil rights are violated, and many individuals and families are destroyed.<br />This also hits me personally, as I know of one individual who was a victim of the McCarthy witch hunt. I just recently found out about this, and after reading Miller's play again after many years, it took on a whole new significance for me. I am grateful to all who stood up to those who tried to take away our most precious rights, and to Miller for writing this play.	2004-03-03

Good debut novel by Hirshberg, concerning a murderer named the \\"Snowman\\" who preyed on children in suburban Detroit in the 1970's. I believe the novel is based on the Oakland County Child Killer, who was running amok during this time period.<br />The serial murders are not the focus of the book; rather, it is the impact of the murders on the three children in this book that drive the plot. Many years later, one of those children, now grown up, goes back to the area to find one of the other children, and hopefully bring some closure to things.<br />It's a dark and chilling novel--sometimes too dark and chilling for its own good. It's also confusing at times when the plot jumps from the 1970's to the 1990's, and back again. This is not a book to be read lightly--it demands your full attention--but I still recommend it. I'll be interested to see what Hirshberg comes up with next.	2004-01-26

Excellent memoir of the lives of Gordeeva &amp; Grinkov, one of the finest Pairs Figure Skaters in history.<br />Gordeeva takes us through their lives, from childhood to when they were first paired up as young skaters. After a time, the young Katia starts to have feelings for the older Sergei, and to her surprize, they are reciprocated. The young couple marry, have a daughter, and, tragically, Sergei dies of a heart attack (later found to be an inherited genetic disorder) at the age of 27.<br />Gordeeva tells a compelling story. It's funny, joyful, and sad, and anyone who follows figure skating probably knows of it. But, as you are reading, it all seems fresh and alive in her mind, and to us as readers. Even though Katia has moved on (a marriage to another Russian skater, Ilia Kulik, and they too have a daughter), Sergei will no doubt always be in her heart, and those of us that were privilaged to see him &amp; Katia skate together will never forget him.	2004-01-24

Olivia Brown is a poetess whose fiancee was killed in WWI. She inherits a house in the Village, and, along with it, a tenant, Harry, a P.I. One night, she stumbles across a dead body that looks suspiciously like her, and she enlists Harry's help to find out what's going on.<br />Good depiction of flappers, Prohibition, and the Jazz Age. The character development was a bit shallow, and I hope the second book will improve on that. There's a lot of potential here!	2004-01-24

Dr. Gordon (a real doctor, by the way) tells us of medical school adventures at (the fictional) St. Swithin's Hospital in London. It's like a combination of &quot;The Interns&quot; and &quot;Animal House,&quot; with lazy students (one who went to med school and failed four times just so he could keep receiving his grandmother's inheritance!), pub crawling, rugby, girlfriends, the horror of cramming for exams, and of the colorful characters (staff, patients, friends &amp; assorted folks that drift in and out) that they come across in a typical crazy day. It's a book that had me laughing on nearly every page, and I can't wait to read the rest of the series.	2004-01-15

Delbert McCoy had it all--19 years old, married, two daughters, working two jobs at the auto plants--and life was grand.<br />Suddenly, in one night, 35 years ago, it all was ruined. Delbert was trapped at the bottom of a staircase at a dance hall when two disgruntled young men who had been refused admittance to the club threw a can of gasoline into the stairwell, and started a fire that burned over 90% of Delbert's body. This book is an inspiring story of his determination to live (after 108 surgeries, with more to come), and return to making a life of his own.<br />Delbert's story is told as if it was done as an interview--like he was talking to you across the kitchen table over a cup of coffee. This creates some repetition (and an editor could have been used at times to clean up some of the spelling and punctuation errors), but the story is so powerful that those things aren't irritating.<br />Anyone who is discouraged with life ought to read this book--it's inspirational, courageous, and full of hope.	2004-01-12

Excellent book about a black man accused of killing a white man in South Africa, during the time of apartheid.<br />Paton's writing works on many levels, and the plot is not a simple one, but the portrait he paints of the time period in South Africa is a powerful one, and I believe that the book deserves the recognition it is finally getting as a result of Oprah's Book Club. I normally shy away from her selections, but as soon as she switched to the classics, I've been impressed with her choices of material.<br />This is a book not to be missed--and I am glad that I discovered it after all of these years.	2003-12-21

This is one of those books (a novelette, really--it's only a little over 100 pages) that has become a classic, and rightfully so. It's about a somewhat shy man, Mr. Chipping, who comes to teach at Brookfield School in 1870. He begins to warm up to his students, after falling in love and marrying Katherine, who brings him out of his shell. He becomes a beloved institution at the school, and is there until the end of his life. It's a wonderful story, told by one of the best of the modern story-tellers, James Hilton.<br />Hilton is a wonderful author, and I never tire of reading his books. He's very good at characterization, and that talent really shines in \\"Chips.\\" \\"Chips,\\" \\"Lost Horison,\\" and \\"Random Harvest\\" are among his best, but I've never read a bad book by Hilton. By all means, check out his books--you'll be glad you did!	2003-12-21

It is a powerful book, about a time in American history that was among the most difficult we have ever faced. This book is a story of the survival of a family that manages to keep their dignity and spirit; no matter what hardships they must endure. Steinbeck's writing grabs you and draws you into the story of the Joad family, along with a vivid portrait of America. It's a book that once picked up is hard to put down. It has been called one of the greatest novels ever written, and that is an opinion I heartily agree with. No other book that I have read captures this period in America's history better than The Grapes of Wrath. Highly recommended.	2003-10-30

It is the start of a partnership that grows and matures as the series progresses (this is the first book in the series).<br />Ms. King has done a wonderful job of giving us a very believable Holmes in his later years, and Mary Russell is a perfect match for him.

I found out so many things about him that I didn't know--such as: he was a stage actor, in Shakespeare, no less! And, his courtship of, and eventual marriage to, Anne Meara, is related--sometimes humorously, sometimes seriously, but always with honesty. Jerry and Anne discover that their career aspirations aren't really the same, and each builds their own career, but never forgetting each other. The road is sometimes bumpy, but they don't lose sight of one another, and their love for each other is deep and true. A fine book, Mr. Stiller!	2003-09-08

Interesting book about Dickey Chapelle. She wanted to be a pilot, but became a photojournalist--the first woman photographer to get accredation to cover the war in the Pacific in World War II. After that, she was present at nearly every noteworthy conflict or event there was--if something was going on, Dickey wanted to be there, and usually got her way. She worked for Life, Reader's Digest, National Geographic, and many other magazines and papers. She was killed in 1965, while with the Marines in Vietnam.<br />Her personal life was not always smooth sailing, and I find it incredible that she achieved all she did.<br />What I found most interesting about Dickey was her spirit--she didn't let conventions or anybody stand in her way. She was a trailblazer in her field, and I'm glad that Roberta Ostroff wrote this book--Dickey certainly deserves recognition for her courage and and heroism.	2003-08-27

Lord Peter Wimsey must find the evidence to clear his older brother, Gerald, the Duke of Denver from the charge of murder.

There is a trial in the House of Lords, something most readers have perhaps heard of, but never have read about in any great detail. We read of the Wimsey family (Lord Peter, the Dowager Duchess, Lady Mary, and the Duke of Denver), and their friends (the Arbuthnots and others), in an excellent depiction of what life was life in the upper-crust families after World War I.<br />I'd recommend this book, and any of the Lord Peter Wimsey series. Also recommended is the TV adaptation starring Ian Carmichael as Lord Peter.	2003-08-27

Written with insight by Sante Kimes eldest son, Kent Walker, this is a story of an extremely dysfunctional family. Sante Kimes and her youngest son, Kenny Kimes, committed various crimes, starting with shoplifting and fraud, and working their way up to murder.

It's the basis for the 1947 film, &quot;The Egg and I,&quot; which stars Claudette Colbert and Fred MacMurray as the young city couple who take to chicken farming. It was written in 1945, and the portrayals of the neighbors and the locality are the highlights of the book, as the young couple struggles to raise chickens, produce, and a baby, while having to deal with the elements, primative living conditions (no electricity or running water), the stove that has a mind of its own, and the neighbors, including the infamous Kettle family (who later appeared in an entire series of films themselves).

I don't normally read Mary Higgins Clark's books, but I decided to give this one a try. It was a fast and interesting read, and I enjoyed it very much.<br />This book was first written in 1969, and is being republished for the first time. It's a book that flashes between George Washington leaving the Presidency in 1797, and his memories of his life, from the beginning, then to when he met Martha (&quot;Patsy&quot;) Custis. He grows fonder and fonder of Patsy, and when she is widowed with two young children to raise, he realizes that he really does love her, and marries her. We also read of the trials and tribulations of their life together, and of Washington's many accomplishments and defeats. I'm not sure how historically accurate this book really is, but I enjoyed it.

I was disappointed in this book. I don't know what Carr was trying to achieve with this novel, but it's a combination of mystery and science fiction that doesn't quite come off, in my humble opinion.<br />It takes place in 2023, and it's mainly about the assassination of the President in 2018. The investigation into it takes the main character, psychiatrist Dr. Gideon Wolfe, through many confusing twists and turns, and I was left confused and wondering what Carr was trying to prove here. It was not easy reading, and it seemed as if the book had been written in haste--there was not the character development nor the detailing one expects from Carr's fiction.	2003-03-31

A mystery filled with wit, and based on the famous Lord Lucan case (a murderer who escaped, and to this day, no one knows if he's alive or dead).

Another promising book that is marred by repetition of the facts (the same story is told over and over again by the German, British, French and Belgian troops). It seems that I've been running across this far too much lately in these short historical books, and it's disappointing.

I really like Celine Dion as a singer, but reading this autobiography was a bit much. It was somewhat disturbing to read of her &quot;courtship&quot; of Rene Angelil. She seduced him--a married man over 20 years older than herself--and does not even mention the repercussions this had on his shaky marriage (it led to divorce, of course). Her fantasies of seducing and being with him when she was only 14 years old were disturbing, as is her almost total dependence on him. I really didn't need to know all of those details--it's almost like reading a tabloid magazine.<br />I think she should stick to what she does best, and leave the book writing to someone else!	2003-01-01

Interesting subject and a story that needed to be told, but it's rather repetitious (everybody seems to have the same recollections of the famous North Platte Canteen), and lacks photos, which would have helped (the cover photo is the only one, and it doesn't even show the canteen).  It would have been nice to see what Greene was writing about, especially since the station no longer exists--a fact we are constantly reminded of throughout the book. It's a quick read, and a decent book to pass the time with, but could have used an editor to tighten up the prose and clean up some typos.  I was disappointed.	2002-12-26

I wish that Benedict and Nancy Freedman had left well enough alone with a much-loved classic, &quot;Mrs. Mike,&quot; and not decided to write a sequel.  It's very disappointing, to say the least.<br />Most of the book is history-class filler, with some glaring errors:  The Berlin Olympics were held in 1936, not 1933, and refueling planes in mid-air did not happen right after WWII.  There's just too much of this sort of thing, and not enough solid original writing.  Do we really get to know the main characters?  They are not fleshed-out well enough for us to decide.  The plot (what there is of it) is predictable, and in all, leaves you wondering why the Freedmans even bothered to try for a sequel.<br />I just hope that there will be no more books...I'd rather remember the original &quot;Mrs. Mike,&quot; the book I loved so much as a child, rather than suffer through another poorly written and conceived sequel.	2002-10-17

What he does is investigate each lead and scrap of information he receives the best he can, and is able to debunk the \\"murder/conspiracy\\" theories by providing explanations, ruling out many of the wild and conflicting theories that have been expounded over the years.  This Pope was the victim of poor health, and neglect; a man not suited for the calling, who knew it, wished he headn't been chosen, and one that suffered from ill health (and prayed to die) which was not communicated to the proper people at the Vatican who could have monitored him more closely.<br />In the end, Cornwell shows us a tragic figure, ill when chosen,  overwhelmed by the responsibilities of his position, who in all probability  died from the stress of it.  Alas, we will never know the truth, but Cornwell makes a very strong case, and is convincing.	2002-06-19

What I thought would be a very interesting look back at some of the most famous crimes in history turns out to be a rather boring book, with a badly executed premise.<br />Dr. Labriola writes most of the book, and Dr. Lee's contributions are in boldface, inserted into appropriate places in the chapters.<br />Dr. Lee uses a semi-fictional plot device where he goes back in time and meets a character named Sam Constant, who is evidently supposed to be the voice of popular opinion.  Dr. Lee spends more time on this fictional character then he does on the actual investigation of the cases.  Much of what Dr. Lee brings up about the older cases (Sacco--Vanzetti, the Lindbergh kidnapping, the John F. Kennedy assassination and others) has already been examined and/or suggested by other authors.<br />And, of course, Dr. Lee spends quite a lot of time on the O.J. Simpson case, for which he was a defense consultant.  Much of what Dr. Lee says about the Simpson case has also been repeated in various other publications.<br />In all, a disappointing book, ruined by a rather hokey premise.	2001-03-26

One of the most influential skaters of the 20th Century, and a man not afraid to speak out about the world of skating.<br />This book is not exactly a sequel to ZERO TOLLERENCE, but it does give us some more biographical detail, regarding problems with drugs, his sometimes wild and crazy lifestyle, his painting, and his struggle to get his life on track.  And, of course, Cranston's opinions on the world of figure skating--warts and all--are worth the price of the book alone.  He's not afraid to criticize a sport that he helped to make popular--he sees the problems, and tells it like it is.

The authors provide us with what is probably the most complete investigation of the trial of Sirhan Sirhan, and it is almost unbelievable at times how badly his defense team acted (or didn't act at all) on Sirhan's behalf.  The description of the destruction of the evidence by the police is also something you have to read to believe.  The procedures that they followed in investigating this case are suspect, and it there is so little left that it makes you wonder if there really was (dare I say it) a cover-up?<br />Sirhan remains an enigma, still claiming no memory of the events.  The ballistic evidence contradicts that he acted alone, but with so much of the evidence missing, it is hard to make a case for his innocence.  A conspiracy?  A cover-up?

All of the best lines from the great &quot;film noir&quot; classics are  here.  There's a line to cover just about every subject, and you can amaze,  amuse or astound your friends by using these quotes in everyday  conversation.  And, in the process, you can discover some pretty great  films, as well--there's a lot of gems in here, and not just big ones like  &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; or &quot;The Big Sleep.&quot;  Check da  others out--you'll be glad ya did!	2000-09-19

Stephens is a bit much as Richard (does he have to yell so often?) but the  supporting cast, with Michael York in a multitude of roles, Dame Peggy  Ashcroft as Margaret, Glenda Jackson as Lady Anne and Jeremy Brett as the  Earl of Clarence (for once, the part is done right--Brett comes off as  believable, not as a whiny brat as in many portrayals) is fantastic.  Unabridged, as another reviewer noted, and digitally remastered, this  recording is the best I've come across so far.  Highly recommended!	2000-09-17

This &quot;Baker Street Dozen&quot; gives us 13 short tales (up to 8 pages  each) which can be easily and quickly read.  If you want a book that you  can pick up, and get a quick fix of Sherlock Holmes, this is a good one  indeed.  Andrews manages to keep true to the characters, and gives us a few  clever plots, but although some solutions are quite &quot;elementary,&quot;  the stories are enjoyable.  One wonders if Andrews' fertile imigination  will ever run out of ideas, as he has published so many of these titles,  but I always keep coming back for more--they are worth it!	2000-09-12

A good overview of the subject, but Breitman, at times, becomes  repetitious, and it does get confusing trying to follow the trail of  evidence that he presents.  Another problem is that many of the  suppositions are made based on documents not yet de-classified, so his  hands are tied before he even starts the book.  But, it is still a powerful  book, on a disturbing subject that needs further examination, and I would  hope that his efforts bring out these long-classified documents from their  secret hiding places, so that we can get the full picture (if that is  indeed ever possible) about these horrible and tragic crimes against  humanity.	2000-09-12

Jeanne Boylan has taken the term  &quot;criminal sketch artist&quot; and given it an entirely new meaning.  She cares -- not only about justice being served, but also about the  victims and their families.  Her talent is amazing, and I believe that  law-enforcement officials should read this book -- there is much they can  learn from her.	2000-08-28
US	51237296	R1NSNA9OT1VC91	0062516078	564522465	The Measure of a Man	Books	5	9	10	N	N	A great book by a great actor...	I didn't know that Sidney Poitier had written a book until I saw the commercial for the &quot;Oprah&quot; show.  I decided to tune in to see the  interview, and found that Mr. Poitier was a very wise person.  So, I  decided to get the book, and I was not disappointed.<br />Poitier's prose is  very much like a friend having a discussion with you over a cup of coffee  -- more like a conversation with an intimate friend, rather than just a  written record of his life and career.  There is much wisdom here -- from  his early beginnings on a small island in the Bahamas, he learned quite a  bit about life and living.  He has carried this knowledge throughout his  life, and he now shares it with us.<br />It's hard to know a person just from  the movies he makes.  Mr. Poitier's body of work speaks volumes -- and so  does this excellent book.	2000-08-28

It is very important that these stories be told, as we are  losing so many of our loved ones because of old age.<br />It is a book that  made me want to know more about my family during that time, and I'm certain  this will spur many others to ask:  &quot;What was it like back  then?&quot;<br />Excellent job!	2000-08-10

He is a man that (althought he had nearly died from the crash that had killed Princess Diana, Dodi Fayed and Henri Paul) has the indomitable spirit to keep  fighting and get his life back on track again.  He is lured by the sleazy  tabloids, and hounded day and night, but manages to stay true to himself.  It is a great story, told by a man whose principles were not compromised by  the lure of instant riches.<br />Also, it is a story of a man, who despite  incredible odds, fights back from near death.  I found it to be very  inspiring.<br />You're a good man, Trevor!	2000-07-28

It deals with the childhood of Sherlock Holmes, and we find out why Holmes is the eccentric, Bohemian man he is as an adult.<br />Dr. Morstein has woven an extraordinary tale; entirely  believable, engrossing, and impossible to put down.  You have never read a  pastiche like this--an incredible book!	2000-07-25

Just when you think it's all over, &quot;the game's afoot&quot; again, and Holmes faces one of the  toughest tests of his life. Enjoyable, and a page-truner, especially  towards the end.	2000-07-12

Unfortunately, it does neither of them justice.  Seil does not have a handle on Holmes'character,  and the Great Detective comes across as a shadow of his former self.  Entrusting a fledgling agent (and Irene Adler's daughter, no less--OY!)  with such an important mission is unrealistic.  And, if all else fails and  the plot runs dry (which it frequently does), throw in some trivia about  the Titanic to fill in space. Neither Sherlockians or Titanic afficianados  will like this book.  At least this one does not.	2000-04-24
