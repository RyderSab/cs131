It's unfortunate, then, that he settles into the very \\"pathology\\" of resistance that he criticizes at the opening of his book. By focusing tightly on individual reflections of these groups' former members, he centers his discussion on emotion, theory, and abstraction. His decision to provide little context for their actions leaves us with the same problems as Aust's study of the RAF: the sense that these people were crazy and disconnected from reality. That might have been the case, but without making some attempt to at least depict that reality, Varon ensures that we can't \\"read\\" the Weather Underground or the RAF as anything other than irrational abberations. A more detailed history of the period might provide a better view - it would at the least allow for the possibility that these extremists' actions had concrete roots. <br /> <br />Not much to like here.	2005-07-28

Those who can only criticize it by attacking the author (\\"too young, too privileged, too inexperienced\\") prove only that they hate the imagination. The book is precise and moving and who cares if the author has \\"lived\\" (as if anyone could determine what that meant). <br /> <br />However, Foer already wrote this book. It was called Everything Is Illuminated, and it was amazing. Consider: both books feature a central narrator with a highly evolved adult mind expressed through broken or corrupted English (in EII it was a Ukrainian writing in English, here, it's a precocious 9 year-old); both books feature a protagonist searching for something elusive in their past; both feature an elder travelling companion with a secret; both are interspersed with \\"magical-realist\\" narratives told by the protagonists' unknown ancestors. <br /> <br />The books are incredibly similar, in good ways and in bad. <br /> <br />I think Foer is a lovely writer and an acute observer. I hope his next book will be its own, instead of another retread.	2005-03-20

Nonetheless, I found this to be an incredible read. It's an absolutely fascinating sketch of an age. The first part of the book includes a rivting examination of Marlowe's education, complete with an in-depth analysis of current intellectual trends and their effects on English cultural and political life. <br /> <br />But this book is well titled: its chief object is the world around Marlowe, not Marlowe himself. As noted in another review, we are given very little information about Marlowe the man. While the thorough detail surrounding his life at each step is fascinating, I came away feeling like I knew next to nothing about the man. Perhaps this is simply honest, as we may not know much about him. But it was an odd feeling. <br /> <br />I also disagree with the reviewer who feels that this book seeks repeatedly to defame Marlowe. I found the book even-handed and uncritical of Marlowe. Perhaps that's because I don't know the \\"other\\" stories that were not included, but I don't feel that this is a brief for the prosecution. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who's intellectually curious.	2005-03-15

The writing is unacceptably choppy and awkward, with paragraphs springing from nowhere and sentences shifting from one grand topic to another without stopping. It's almost laughable. Chock full of details and totally lacking in style or spirit, this book will only be useful to those seeking a blow by blow chronology of Camus' life - and the chronology is uneven at best (many times Todd goes back several months without clear indication).    Poor writing wouldn't be a problem if there was at least a point of view, but Todd offers us none, preferring instead to recounting facts and quoting at length from Camus' letters. The fact that Camus was such a crystalline writer only makes this book seem like more of an insult.    I was hugely disappointed by this book. (...)	2004-12-23

It has provided me with the strongest, most clear-headed confidence in the face of unrelenting hypocrisy and struggle. Camus was on the side of the angels for all of the conflicts of his time, a time that saw the darkest face of humanity. His arguments for compassion and justice are utterly transfixing and revelatory, and written with a clarity and insight that are simply breath-taking.<br /><br />I challenge anyone that supports the death penalty to read \\"Reflections on the Guillotine\\" and walk away with their arguments intact. In this piece Camus utterly demolishes every argument for state-sanctioned murder while defending the right to live with dignity, a right that can easily encompass the self-defense by combat necessitated by circumstance.<br /><br />Camus was a moral, intellectual, and physical hero, and reading these essays one is almost overcome by his sense of humilty, justice, and compassion. His writing is so crystalline, it's almost jolting. This is a powerful tonic for all those that despair of creating a place for the best qualities of the human race in times of utter darkness. A must-read.	2004-12-02

I'm afraid however, that some reviewers, like the \\"insane book lover\\" miss the point entirely: the French were kicked out of Algeria after much bloodshed. They, like the US today, refused to understand the source of hatred directed at them, and so there was no way for them to fight it.

His writing is lazy, unconsidered, and is absolutely RANK with the smell of embellishement and outright fabrication. There's simply no way to take writing this atrocious seriously; the fabrications and embellishments are so transparent, the mind boggles at how he got this sold as non-fiction.    One last note: Mezrich never states that he changed names or places to protect anyone. According to the book, the protagonist was in the Weston, MA public school system until high school. I was in the Weston public school system at the same time; in fact, according to the chronology, Mr. Lewis was either in my class or the one below me. I have the yearbooks from Mr. Lewis' last years at Weston. He's not in any of them, not anywhere. If Mezrich changed his name, fair enough. If not, who on earth is this guy?	2004-08-10

Johnson does not come out of this looking that good, but Caro builds the stakes for Johnson so well that we wind up rooting for him. A phenomenal read. This book stays fairly tightly focused on Johnson and his opponent in the '48 Senate race, so it is not as satisfying as Master of the Senate, but it is a masterful book. There are also, if you care to see them, blood-curdling similarities between Johnson and W Bush: both were/are run by Brown & Root, and they both used the SAME legal tactics to steal their most important elections. Both men wanted desperately to avoid a recount in contested areas (Johnson because he so flagrantly broke the law, Bush because he feared that he would be exposed as the loser [or, if you are conspiracy-minded, he feared that his manipulation of the law through his Campaign Head, Florida Sec. of State Harris, would be exposed]) and both men used the same legal path to avoid one.

For the first 30 pages I kept asking myself if it was possible that a book could be so beautifully written. Unfortunately, the answer is complicated. The reason I couldn't place where the writing struck me is that it is beautiful while being profoundly false. Despite its charms, the book lacks a strong emotional or narrative thread, touching down where Truong wishes to spend time rather than where any kind of intellectual or emotional interest might take us. The whole book begins to smell of artifice well before the the end. Perhaps most grievously, this book is a Classic example of a middle-class person writing about poor people. Absolutely missing is any sense of the dirt, despair, and darkness of lives lived under the thumb of colonialism and racism. The poetic language in many ways betrays the detailed, lovely writing, exposing it as the fantasy of someone far distant from the world of which she writes. Ultimately, Truong comes off as a romantic poseur. A very convincing one, but you can smell the tin beneath the flowers.	2004-07-09

I highly recommend it to anyone interested in extreme forms of any faith, and especially to anyone interested in American fringe groups. I must say, however, that the book is savagely anti-religion. By far the most provocative chapter in the book is that in which he recounts psychiatrists debating whether or not someone who converses with God is crazy. This section should give pause to us all. As someone that long ago repudiated his own involvement with organized religion, I share all of Krakauer's concerns and fears. However, as someone interested in getting the word out, I find that Krakauer's transparent anipathy towards religion and his dismissive style hurts his case, which here amounts to drawing a very short line between fundamentalist Mormonism and the Church of Latter Day Saints. This line exists, and the youth of the religion makes it a necessarily short one, but Krakauer shortens it too much to make his point. For more on Mormonism than you will get in the book, I humbly point you towards Benton Harper's very interesting review on this site.	2004-06-28

To him, they were the best at everything they tried their hands at, and the poor West serves as a bumbling, backward foil to this genius people. While Japanese superiority in a number of fields is well-documented (and Perrin does a good job with the quality of swords) Perrin's chauvinism is jarring and makes it hard to hear him. It also blinds him to what seems to be the major force behind the Japanese reversion to the sword: at the same time, Japan closed itself almost entirely to foreigners (who had introduced guns and every innovation having to do with them to Japan). The ferocious chauvinism of 17th - 18th century Japan (which one might daresay existed through, say, 1945, and contibuted not a small amount to their cruel wars of conquest in Asia), combined with a centralized, authoritarian, non-democratic, government and pacified country-side, are clearly the major forces behind the reversion to the sword - and this much is clear using nothing but Perrin's book! Still, he can't admit it, which is frustrating. By avoiding this critical aspect of the Japanese reversion to the sword, with all of its very unsavory aspects, Perrin sabotages any understanding of what such an action meant and could mean for us. Maybe a more thoughtful commentator can provoke us to ask some meaningful questions.	2003-01-01

She lead an incredible life, battled staggering pain and loss, managed a marriage with a furiously self-involved genius while becoming one herself (a genius, that is), and created her own mythology. Frida's story is incredible, and Herrera brings us into contact with her totally unique energy.<br />But still. After pages and pages of direct citations from Kahlo's diary, after pages and pages of psychoanalytical interpretation of her paintings, the book starts to wear out its welcome. The politics of Mexico are not given any where near as much detail as desirable, and as for the rest of the world . . . forget it. WWII isn't even mentioned, and her relationship with the Communist Party is glossed over. For such a political woman as Kahlo, the absence of any analyis of the world she lived in is pretty stunning, and a major weakness of the book, since it makes it ultimately impossible to understand her.<br />Still, Frida Kahlo was a great painter and an extraordinary woman. To learn both more and less about her than you want, this is the perfect book.	2002-11-11

There are also some truly bizarre logical leaps, not the least of which being his insistence that there may be more than one protagonist in a story, based on a mis-understood quote of Dryden's (where Dyden uses the word in plural, clearly referring to more than one play). That said, the obvious compassion of the author and his excitement over the topic were infectious, and despite the book's obvious short-comings, I happily breezed through it in a day. I was particularly moved by the author's attention to the man that Minor murdered, refusing to let us forget the innocent man's death that started the story Winchester seeks to tell. For those of us easily wound up in history, mystery, and words, Winchester very deliberately reminds us of a man whose life was violently ended for no reason, and dedicates the book to him.	2002-09-04

For 900 of its 1000+ pages, I was absolutely riveted, unable to think of anything else until I finished. The strongest and most indelible impression left by the book is of the utter corruption of the US Senate, an institution steeped in reactionary politics and thoroughly soiled by \\"campaign contributions,\\" otherwise known as bribes from big business. To read in such detail of Senators' horse-trading their votes, abandoning all principle for personal gain within the Senate playground, is truly chilling. Caro's portrait of the Senate is devastating, and no one who holds our government in high esteem can leave this book unshaken. The book is flawed, however. While generally a huge fan of Caro's style, sometimes he gets the better of himself, writing run on sentences (one ran 8 lines and included over 15 commas) and repeating his own analysis.<br />In fact, this last criticism points to a large weakness in the book's closing chapters: Caro seems determined to make the passage of the \\"Civil Rights\\" bill of '57 the climax of the book and to give Johnson credit for it, yet he lacks the evidence to do so. He spends page after page assuring the reader how impossible any compromise was on this bill while offering little detail as to what Johnson was doing between January and July of '57. In fact, several critical decisions were not made or even very much influenced by Johnson. While Johnson pulled off sevearl stunning maneuvers, they came after months of prevarication and they all severed to destroy the bill's spirit. The bill itself was no great shakes, as Caro briefly admits, and was so gutted by the time it was passed that all but the most deluded of liberals recognized that it was almost worse than passing noting. Johnson may have \\"redeemed\\" himself in '64 and '65, but the '57 bill was a shameful, useless piece of legislation.<br />However, the book is thrilling and horrifying and a terrific read. There are many gorgeous set pieces, including the history of the Senate, the barbaric crucifixion of Leland Olds, the mini-bio of Russell, and the account of the '56 Democratic Convention. An interesting sub-theme running through the book is the corruption of Hubert Humphrey, a Senator with so much promise who quickly emasculated himself and his beliefs in order to gain political advantage as Johnson's toady. That sad, sad tale will hopefully be told in someone else's book.<br />Finally, to the criticism that this book does not delve deeply enough in Johnson the man or his psyche, well, that's fine by me. I came to this book hoping to learn about LBJ (I haven't read the first two in the series) and the Senate. I got absolutely more than I could handle. As I see it, the book's subtitle, \\"The Years of Lyndon Johnson,\\" rebuffs any criticism that it focusses to much on events outside of LBJ. As it is, this book provides us with a terrifying close-up view of Senate power through its use and, more often, abuse, by Johnson.	2002-08-26

Smith has cobbled together lots of stories and lots of characters, but with almost no precision whatsoever. This is a page-turner for sure, but the almost total lack of characterization or observation of human nature, and smug posturing make for a tiresome read indeed. Comparisons to Rushdie are not only totally outrageous (he knows how to write with depth, feeling, and intellect) but also mildly racist, positing as they do that any writer of color chronicling immigrant life in London must be like Rushdie. Stop thinking about buying this book and go to the master. For a book on being a colored immigrant in London, pick up Satanic Verses instead.	2002-07-18

But Bobrick fails on many counts. His obsession with Washington bogs us down in lengthy quotations from the heroic general (who surely deserves such veneration) and slants the narrative towards him at the expense of too many other players and events. We learn almost nothing about what the country as a whole thought or was even doing during the War. Aside from a short chapter peppered with anecdotal episodes that fail to convey the feeling of the time, Bobrick doesn't tell us anything about the experience of the war from any standpoint other than the major military campaigns (that is, aside from his obsession with who slept with whom during the war, a topic he regularly broaches for no apparent reason other than to prove that everyone was pretty randy at the time). And even there he skimps on detail when Washington is far from the scene (Greene's conquest of the South after Monmouth is given one paragraph!). The book is not bad for a single volume account, but it could have been far, far better if Bobrick had chosen to write more about people and events futher away from Washington.	2002-06-10

But what happened to the author of Citizens, Landscape and Memory, An Embarrassment of Riches? Apparently he has turned into a lazy, arrogant, and smug hack. This book is horrendous. It is Great Men of History of the crassest order - it's not just that his absurd attempts to rehabilitate Cromwell based on a discredited historian fall flat, it's that he has no time for anyone outside the ruling classes. Worst of all, Schama seems content to have let other people do his research and then take potshots and speculate from the sidelines of his own book.

His prose ranges wildly from the enjoyably seamy to the (unintentionally) absurdly pseudo-poetic and his characterizations remain largely simple-minded and very, very male. This, despite the fact that our heroine is, well, a heroine. The more the book attempts to draw parallels between racial harmony and mechanical (or other) elevation, the less beleivable he becomes. And his depction of the duelling philosophies of Intuition and Empiriciam winds up smacking of the starkest and cheapest (reverse) racism. There is some choice writing here, but increasingly one just wants Whitehead to stop posturing and get on with the story. If he had had something interesting to say about race and an interesting way of putting it, I'm sure I would have felt otherwise.	2002-05-07

It sheds light on many episodes in American history that were too long swept under the rug. For that alone, it is an essential complement to any reading of US history. It is merely a companion, however, since it is useless on its own. The lack of footnotes is unpardonable. No footnotes, no credibility. What disturbs me most about this book is its relentless attempt to manufacture a conspiracy amongst the eilte of every historical period. Surely there is more to know about how the US government really runs, and Zinn does much to enlighten us. However, to accuse so many people of acting in bad faith, to strip virtually everyone in government of all but their worst qualities is beyond unfair, it is dangerous. For those inclinded to conspiracy theories, this book is manna. For those inclined to skepticism, this book is fascinating. The frightening thing is that the book proposes to be a cure to a one-sided, biased, thoughtless, and incomplete telling of US history; in fact, Zinn merely reintroduces speculation and bias into our system.	2002-03-05
US	53023206	R4EPFPQ2TGLGE	0684813637	747139631	John Adams	Books	3	5	8	N	N	Another hagiography	This is an impressive book. The scholarship is unbeatable, the narrative impressive, and the story remarkable. It is also, on a physical level, quite gorgeous: lovely font and paper and cover. And yet why does it seem that modern historians feel the need to either glorify or assasinate the character of their subjects of biography? This book falls squarely in the former category, with no misstep, flaw, or incongruity in Adams presented without a lenghty rationalization. An example is McCullough's treatment of the Alien and Sedition Act (lasting all of two and half pages), surely one of the lowest points in US government and its earliest and most egregious breach of the Constitution. McCullough lays the blame on Congress and then tries to explain why the measure might have been necessary in a time of (un)decalred war. Adams was a great man, and this book does much to restore him to a deserved place amongst the founders of our country. McCullough also does a great deal to draw a clear and sobering comparison between Adams and Jefferson. Yet, interest flags near the end of this tale, as one realizes that Adam's temper has been dulled, his character softened, his views blurred, and his accomplishments exaggerated (as great as they were, McCullough manages to oversate them; countless accomplishments are described as bringing Adams &quot;more pride than any other.&quot;) in the interests of sanctifying a man many of his contemporaries found reason to dislike. One can feel McCullogh's desire to burnish Adams' resputation, which inevitably leads to distrust of the author. How could it be that so many found him to be insane and yet we read so little of why they might think so? Surely there is a more interesting and compelling man behind the praise McCullough lavishes on Adams.	2002-03-05

The Inside Story Of A Phenomenon	Books	3	9	9	N	N	Incomplete	It's true that this is a very, very thorough account of the B-M Group's activities. Sometimes the details are a little much (like a breakdown of Baader and Ensslin's monthly spending in early '71) and yet their accumulation provides for a fascinating glimpse inside the lives of the Group. Since this is a translation, it is difficult to say if it is the writing or the translation that is so wooden and choppy.<br />I have two major criticisms of the book: the first is its leaps in chronology. Sometimes Aust skips months and years to follow a thread through to its end, and this often creates confusion as to what happened when. While it's clear that he does this to illustrate a point or follow someone's involvement, it was confusing as often as not.<br />The second criticism, and a major failing for me, is that Aust fails to provide much of any kind of context for the time. We are given next to no background on the social or political or economic climate in which the Group operated. At first this seems to tilt the book in the Group's favor (as does the choice of photographs, all of which are of members of the Group or their supporters and none of which feature their victims), since everyting is told from their viewpoint. But this lapse shifts towards condemning the Group, since we never get a feel for what they were fighting against and why or how it could have seemed so important to commit themselves to violence. Aust ends the book with: \\"They were seven years that changed West Germany.\\" But you would never know that from the book, as there is virtually no account of how the public at large responded to the Group.<br />A minor note is how startling it is to find out for the first time, on page 100, that Aust knew some of the Group and that he assisted in the kidnapping/rescue of Meinhoff's children. A little disclosure at the beginning seems only fair.<br />.... ....	2002-02-11

And yet. The novel grates because its world is benevolent well beyond credulity. I counted exactly two (mildly) unpleasant characters in close to 700 pages, and neither of these two (men, natch) earn more than several pages between them. Our protagonist is so unflaggingly comprehending and curious and forgiving that all drama is drained from the book well before its finish. The specifics of this imagined world are so fine as to wash away much of its impossibly liberal tone, but about half way through one longs for some conflict or drama. I began to dread the narrator's encounters for fear that the next stranger would prove more benevolent than the last. If either the narrator or the author had had more complexity the other one would have been tolerable. However, when both contrive to convince us that mid-19th century America was such a benign and instructive place, the mind recoils. To live in the world Naslund describes would have been a wonderful thing. Too bad she fails so badly to convince us that such a place ever existed.	2001-08-26

There is more artistry, beauty, complexity, poetry, and thought in the first 50 pages of Underworld than in all 241 of Mao II. Mao II is only an &quot;intellectual novel&quot; in the sense that the plot is formulaic, the characterizations poor, and most of the dialogues speeches from the author. DeLillo's ideas of images and culture and identity would be more provocative if they were not ladled out in such self-gratifying, stultifying dialogue. The protagonist's photo shoot is particularly insufferable and the whole novel seemed to be one massive stroking of the author's ego. There are, it is true, some great passages, the most remarkable, for my money, being an exchange between the protagonist and his publisher. But overall this seems to be a lazy work; too much is taken for granted and not enough strived for -- all of the novel's propositions are played out either in monotonous speeches or the most contrived plot development. Again, perhaps I have been spoiled by the unremitting genius and power of Underworld and nothing else will compare.	2001-06-05

Perhaps it is only when TR enters the national political stage that Morris' failure to investigate TR's policies and his shrewd two-facedness becomes clear. Morris is clearly in love with his subject, and I was too, until it became clear that TR could do no wrong, was always justified, always did the right thing. As anyone passingly familiar with American history and American politics at the turn of the century will know, Morris' description of Teddy's politics is horribly one-sided and shallow. Everything is seen in the light of TR's will, and precious little (except for the magnificent section on the closing of NYC saloons on Sunday) placed next to the people, the public that lived under his rule. I have nothing against TR, he is convincingly portrayed as a simply astonishing human speciman; and yet, by the end I came to second-guess everything due to Morris' blind devotion. Perhaps a more cautious historian could not have produced such fabulous writing or story-telling. Perhaps a more cautious historian would have deepened our understanding of TR and his times. It seems sure than no one can write more closely to the man.	2001-05-01

For someone as out of touch with Islam as I, the novel was about love. And I was quite provoked by some of the propositions here.

Wolfe seems to believe that by piling on the exclamation points, the repetition, the mockery, and the intentional philistinism, he can convince us that everything in modern architecture is a sham. His style is the first instance of his colossal failure to hit a very, very broad target. I am no fan of the glass box, I pretty much hate it. But I would never convince myself that its designers were acting in bad faith. This pamphlet is one long sneer at the supposed bad faith of modern architecture. As if they were trying to pull something over on the public. Without one shred of evidence. There is plenty to document the pretension of modern architecture, which in itself is no great sin. So, unable to note this aspect of the work -- for Wolfe is quite pretentious himself -- he taunts the men for not really believing in principles Wolfe does not share. So, for failing to miss the target, dock him three points. For writing like a 5th grader, dock him another two.	2001-01-11

But they are equally provocative. Bergson's thesis may not suit all of us, but it must challenge even those of us involved in the comedic professions to re-examine why people laugh. I think his observation of what makes something funny as opposed to tragic - the elimination of emotion - is pretty spot on. How else could we laugh at someone falling down the stairs? The moment we think of the actual pain or humiliation, the comedy dies at least a little. While the book does not directly attack the magic of those beings, clowns and tricksters, who simulataneaously inspire laughter and sadness and/or fear, the principles of the book lead to what sorts of rules these people follow. If you can extraploate from the thought laid out here, many, many questions will be answered and perhaps even more raised. Which makes this an indispensible book for anyone in the performing arts. Highly, highly recommended.	2000-11-12

That the book is exhaustive -- the lists of food served and brought to San Simeon are endless -- is not always a strength, nor does it ensure that we have a grasp of what Hearst lived and felt. While hewing to the old-school style of biography/hagiography proves rewarding in some respects, it leaves many questions unanswered. We learn almost nothing about the political or social climate of the times in which Hearst lived, and so have little to no way of putting his writings and actions in context. Nonetheless, this is a very personal, almost moving account. That Hearst appears, despite Nasaw's best efforts, as little more than a spoiled rich kid who throws money around with varying degrees of mission and intelligence is no one's fault. A dilletante for his entire life, Hearst had amazingly little control over the effects of his money-spending. This makes a certain amount of sense, since he did nothing so much as spend his father's money for most of his life. It is chilling to think that someone as free from self-possession as WRR could change us so much.	2000-08-26

I am not an historian, and I cannot say whether Schama is  biased to the left, right, up, or down. It does seem to me as if his  uncompromising analysis of the facts and relentless attention to detail  would stir up anyone comfortable in her understanding of this time. This  book rocked my understanding of ALL revolutions, especially the Bolshevik  in 20th century Russia. Schama's passion for justice and right drive a  spike through the hypocritic hearts of both critics and apologists for the  revolution, leaving us to sit amongst our own prejudices. The accumulation  of detail provided here paints a devastating portrait of this complex time,  and Schama's narrative brilliance drives the story forward with total  conviction and fire.

I am willing to lay the blame for failing to enjoy or be moved by this translation at my own feet. That said, I was very  disappointed. Heaney may or may not have done wonders for the original  text; I wouldn't know. What I do know is that the structure itself kept me  at bay. The life of these people was drowned in the ritual, the action  drowned in the talk. I suppose I entered the book looking for something as  shattering and moving as the Fagles' translations of Homer. It is no slight  to Heaney to say that he falls far short of Fagles in turning an ancient  story into something exhilirating to the modern reader. Perhaps it is the  source material: Homer has survived for longer on his own merits, whereas  Beowulf has surivived because of its place in history. The form of the  story itself may be, I am sure, fascinating to some sutdents and scholars.  But to the simple masses, it may rest as it did for me: remarkably heavy  and awkward for such a slight volume. Sorry.	2000-03-22

And it's true. Anyone with an interest in China, communism, women, LIFE, will find  this a gripping and startling book. Endlessly compelling and deeply felt,  this book is astounding. A gem.	1999-10-31

This book may just change the way you think about humankind, killing, and war. No small feat. Perhaps most telling about the  book is the compassion which streams through each page. A stunning  examination of a difficult topic.	1999-05-25

Exquisitely imagined, beautifully told, this novel goes as deep into story-telling and its effect on the  tellers and the listenters as I can imagine. Truly beautiful, and a deeply  disturbing ending.	1999-05-06

Nor is it the precision with which Unsworth draws his characters. It is, rather, the skill, always evident in his work, with which he illuminates moral dilemnas that makes this book  unforgettable. An intense foray into the mind and heart of am informer,  this novel will touch all those who have ever wanted to tell their own  story but felt unworthy. A very disturbing and moving work, like all of his  other novels that I have read.	1999-05-06

The robust prose, the thoughtful characterizations, the bursts of poetry, and the sustained pride in being a (white) Australian were all fantastic. However, this book of 600 pages  never really lets you care about the narrator, which grew more and more  problematic. After so long, you want to feel more for the story-teller. I  was, however, entranced by the sense of righteousness about being a white  Australian, and found the treatment of racism towards Asians constantly  provocative. At the same time, for a book so preoccupied with Australia, it  was strangely devoid of Aborigines and their plight at the hands of  Europeans. I also found the ending tacked on and hardly worthy of the gusto  of the rest of the book. Nonetheless, a pleasant, fascinating read.	1999-04-20
US	53023206	R3JNZ39WTACLIB	0571119662	154039341	Rattle Bag: An Anthology of Poetry	Books	4	21	24	N	Y	Well done	A fascinating collection, more useful for insights into the favorites of two of the more important poets of the late 20th century than for anything else. While bowing down to no old chestnuts out of misplaced respect, the  collection also suffers from a preferance for poets from Ireland and the  United Kingdom and some choices seemingly inspired by multi-culturalism and  little else. Nonetheless, the collection does have some wonderful pieces  that would be hard to find on one's own, as well as a fantastic tribute to  Shakespeare by including several passages from his plays and none of the  sonnets.	1999-04-05

Not because it is hyper-intellectual and most everyone will need a dictionary on each page. This book is so difficult because it taps into the heart of the crazy abyss of love. It  seemed at times as if the book could only be understood by someone in the  madness of love as s/he reads it. Having loved before is not enough: the  details and precision applied to this insanity are too exact, too  punishing, too passionate for me to believe that this book can make the  same sense for those in love as for those out of it. By the same token, to  read this while in love can be a demolishing experience. To know that this  passion has been felt and analyzed so well by someone of towering intellect  is little solace to the solitude one feels reading these words. A brilliant  and disturbing book.	1999-04-05
US	53023206	R1QHTFXNQSNSM4	0679440089	572624538	Jack Maggs	Books	3	1	1	N	Y	Enjoyable, but less provocative than it wants to be	Certainly the lives described in this novel are full of period interest and detail. Certainly, the story is rocket propelled. And yes, there are some quite, quite moving passages. And yet the book rings somewhat hollow.  The conceit of telling Maggs' story through his letters and through his  sessions under the magnetic power of Tobias Oates felt clumsy. And the  relationship between authors and their subjects was hardly approached with  any new insights. An entertaining, if unprovocative novel.	1999-02-20

The chapter which contains the thoughts of a ghost is one of the most moving and surreal things I have ever read. The book loses some steam after  it comes clean about the identity of Beloved, but by then the force and  beauty of the novel are too well installed to budge. Gorgeous, gorgeous,  gorgeous.	1999-02-20

Fagles not only captures the oral nature of the poem, but invigorates it with a sense of the present. This translation makes the other, older, &quot;chestnuts&quot; seem like ancient  history, while this is the fire-breathing present. Wonderful.	1999-02-07

With  characters this sharply defined, stories this gracefully interwoven, battle  so terrifyingly described, there is little wonder this story has lasted for  millenia. A stunning achievement, and a truly gorgeous homage to Homer.	1999-02-07
US	53023206	R2XT06ESYHD07Q	0316919896	891948822	A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again: Essays and Arguments	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Yes Yes Yes	Brilliant, upendingly hilarious, and penetrating. Wallace's essays require stamina, concentration, imagination, and more than a dash of snobbery. His condescension towards the midwest which he gruesomely displays in his essay  on the Illinois State Fair almost took the steam out of me. But I forged  on, to be rewarded with what I imagine to be THE definitive essay on  pleasure cruising. Whether recreating the heartbreak and drive of  professional tennis journeymen, exploring the damage irony has wreaked on  contemporary fiction, or contemplating the sinister workings of his  on-board shower, Wallace flagrantly displays his virtuoso talent. If you  are afraid of mind bending romps of theoretic fancy, painfully funny asides  on every neurosis in the book, or keeping up with a gifted, precocious  mind, this book is not for you. The laughs and the insights don't come  cheap, but they're worth every single penny. A wonder.	1998-11-29
US	53023206	R2I4AJM8QYPRZG	0385492510	409245980	Gates of Fire	Books	4	0	2	N	Y	Fascinating, Enchanting . . . and a little dangerous	This is a very, very powerful book. Written with seemingly impeccable research and fevered conviction, Pressfield successfully brings the heat and heartbreak of battle breathing to our very faces. A fromidable feat of  imagination. And yet . . . the use of several melodramatic set-pieces and  maudlin exchanges mars an otherwise superbly written novel. For this  reader's tastes, there was rather too much noble opining by Spartan leaders  and too much ham-fisted romance (although, strangely, never explicitly  amongst the men of the Spartan army, many of whom most surely had male  lovers). I was also disturbed by Pressfield's palpable worship of the  Spartan men. Not only that, but his novelist's skill is such that I  challenge anyone not to find themselves similarly inclined. Unfortunately,  in this book, the result is fairly a glorification of war. Without a doubt,  the Three Hundred were/are worthy of glorification. However, a novel which  leaves us thrilled and excited by battle is, ultimately, just a little   dangerous.	1998-11-22

Instead, I found a dull collection of &quot;wacky&quot; and gruesome  vignettes. Instead of characters, we have carboard cutouts. Instead of  subversive thought, we have plain ideology. Instead of true invention, we  have unfocussed experimentation. And instead of a story, we have a plot. A  bruising disappointment for a huge fan.	1998-10-06
