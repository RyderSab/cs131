But when he tries to explain the context for his material, Simmons often gets all tangled up.  <br /> <br />For example, on p. 52, he writes, \\"Faisal bitterly remembered the pledge that Franklin D. Roosevelt had made to his father, assuring Abdul Aziz that Saudi Arabia would always have a seat at the table when a resolution to the Palestinian problem was to be decided.\\" <br /> <br />Yet we don't have any evidence that FDR didn't said that, so Faisal could simply have bitterly mis-remembered it! We do know that FDR said things like this, \\"I will take no action in my capacity of chief of the executive branch of this government which might prove hostile to the Arab people.\\" But that's a personal pledge, \\"I ... my...\\" -- not binding upon Truman or anyone since.	2005-07-27

This book shows how that state of affairs came to be.  <br /> <br />I found the material on the 1930s especially illuminating, because it provides us with a picture of the Saud family, and to a degree a picture of Arabia, before the rest of the world came to appreciate the strategic significance of petroleum, and before the Second World War made all national boundaries something up for negotiation and renegotiation.  <br /> <br />We're also treated to an illuminating dicussion of when marriages (and by extension polygamy) is, and when it isn't, a valuable tool for the forging of political alliances. This is an analytical take on a subject usually rushed through with cliches.	2005-07-22

The writing is muddled, the accretion of details is exhausting, and one is forever being dustracted but infelicities of expression, such as the guiding metaphor of \\"flatness\\" itself.  <br /> <br />If the earth were in fact flat, then one edge of it would be the furthest possible distance from the opposite edge. The sphericity of the world has the opposite implication: there are no \\"opposite edges\\" -- which is the point that a globalization advocate like Friedman ought to be happy to make. So his central metaphor expresses pretty near the opposite of what he seems to want it to express.	2005-06-27

This merits some acknowledgement.  <br /> <br />For example, it appears that one of those 'answers within' was offered by Halet Efendi, Ottoman ambassador in Paris in 1806, who suggesyed that his homeland could reverse its then declining fortunes if it put some revenue aside to build five factories, for \\"snuff, paper, crystal, cloth, and porcelain ... since the basis of all their current trade is in these five commodities.\\"  <br /> <br />Some rulers and ministers took such advice, or \\"more sophisticated versions\\" thereof, and tried to close the gap with the western powers by building factories. It didn't work, and most of the early factories were examined.  <br /> <br />What, then, are the cultural preconditions that make industrialization sustainable? It is a good question, and Lewis has helped me develop further my own thoughts on that point.	2005-06-05

His conflicts with environmentalists became legendary, in some circles at least, as when he quite publicly called Jay Hair, head of the National Wildlife Federation, a liar after the NWF said that Alcoa was the nation's worst industrial pollutor. <br /> <br />Most CEOs would likely have \\"played the game\\" with Hair. They would have issued a mildly worded statement in response to his charges, \\"we're trying our best to keep these emissions out, and we invite the NWF to name a member to our new committee on the next generation of scrubbers,\\" etc. Confrontation is risky, but it seems to have been in O'Neill's nature.  <br /> <br />Such confrontations (especially since O'Neill was on the 'right' side of them, from their point of view) probably helped persuade the Bush team to offer O'Neill the Treasury post.  <br /> <br />Yet his confrontational nature expressed itself again within the administration, as he had warned them it might, it ways that they found, and still find, discomforting. <br /> <br />A fascinating book, whatever you end up thinking about the story it tells.	2005-05-25

Some of your other reviewers seem to take it amiss that Adler's book isn't written for everyone. Its written for people who are familiar with some of the basics of the history of the magazine -- who know and perhaps already have opinions about the works of Truman Capote or Hannah Arendt that first appeared in this magazine before becoming successful and extremely controversial books.<br /><br />If that sort of book is not one that will interest you then, well ... this is not the book for you. But its rather goofy to criticize the author for having written a book for someone other than yourself, isn't it?<br /><br />This is an excellent book given its target. Furthermore, I believe that even if I didn't fit the above description of this book, I might have learned a good deal from it about the craft of non-fiction prose. The discussion of the \\"characteristic structure\\" of Adam Gopnik's articles, on pp. 243-44, is a little gem of analysis -- and you don't have to have read Gopnik to appreciate it, since most people who read a good deal have reas authors who use the same faulty structure she describes here.	2005-05-01

He worked in that field for the next seven years, from one post-doctoral fellowship to another. I'm no judge, but it appears that his work on the phenomenology of muons was well regarded. <br /> <br />A muon, in case you're wondering, is an oversized electron, with the same negative charge but more than 200 times the mass. In the context of the physics of subatomic particles, \\"phenomenology\\" refers to the work that bridges the gap between experimental results and pure theory. Apparently, the lab folks and the blackboard scribblers don't talk to each other much, so a mediating specialty has developed; it consists of physicist diplomats who talk to both sides. The phenomenologists explain why the recent laboratory results of Professor Smith are (or aren't) consistent with the theories of Professor Jones.  <br /> <br />In fact, one of the subtler revelations of those book is the largely implicit analogy between the theory/experimentation gap in physics and the abyss separating finance theory and the activity of traders. In the latter area, too, Derman regards   <br />himself as a mediator.  <br /> <br />But to finish up with his physics career ... he found it impossible to obtain a faculty position at a major university doing the work he loved on a tenure track, and he grew weary of the prolonged adolescence, as he calls it, of a perennial post-doctoral fellow. So he left academic life for Bell Labs, Murray Hill, N.J., in 1980.  <br /> <br />There he discovered the joys of computer programming and helped create the Hierarchical Equation Solver, which was a precursor of the Lotus spreadsheet. He loved the work. He finds computer languages elegant and the innovative use of them to conquer a new task wonderfully challenging.  <br /> <br />In his discussion of this period in his life, the first half of the 1980s, he mentions a series of courses on computer science that his bosses arranged at his alma mater, Columbia. That is how he came to study database theory with David Shaw. He describes Mr. Shaw as \\"an early incarnation of the now ubiquitous capitalist academic\\" with a small leather day planner in his pocket and always at work on a parallel-processing computer he called NonVon.  <br /> <br />That's just a sample of what you'll find here.

Behind the class struggle, according to Freud, there stands the struggle between father and son, between established clan leader and rebellious challenger.

One of the cool things about this, from their point of view, was that they didn't have to treat the options as an expense on their books, so that as far as real or prospective investors were concerned, they were buying that much labor for nothing.  <br /> <br />The FASB, sensibly, wants to crack down on this. An economy of monopoly money isn't good, as we should have learned since 2000.  <br /> <br />But the CEO of Intel, predictably, doesn't want to go along, and complains that the best anyone can do with the expensing of options is to come up with a fizzy approximate \\"kind of right\\" figure, so they shouldn't have to come up with any figure. The authors quote that statement, and seem to endorse it.  <br /> <br />It is nonsense.  The effective figure Mr. Barrett and others are using now is ... zero.  Yes, Black-Scholes or any other proposed method will be imperfect but zero is demonstrably wrong.  If the worth of an options grant was zero, it wouldn't be useful in hiring or retaining anybody. People don't work for zero.  <br /> <br />One doesn't need to wear the Mandelbrot set on one's tee shirt to see that the FASB has common sense on its side on this one.  <br /> <br />Otherwise, though, there is much of value in this mixed-bag of a book, and I'm giving it three stars.	2004-10-07

From General Wavell's headquarters in Cairo, Egypt, the theatre looked like an enormous wheel, with a southern spike toward Addis Ababa, one northward to Athens, another west - to Tobruk in Libya, and a final spoke heading east, to Damascus. Recent fighting within that huge wheel (the image is Alan Moorehead's, taken over here by Porch) had gone against the Axis powers, so that the axis of this wheel - Egypt itself, with its crucial canal - was secure.    <br /> <br />Within days, though, everything would change. Rommel would begin an offensive in Libya. There was a pro-Axis coup in Iraq beginning in March 31, triumphant by April 3. The Germans declared war on Greece on April 6. The news from south of Egypt at this time was good, British tropps pushed the Italians out of their Somaliland protectorate - but perhaps in a sense it was too good - Wavell has been accused of pressing the campaign to his south at the expense of troop needs around the rest of his perimeter.  <br /> <br />It was in this context that both sided prepared for a show-down on the island of Crete. Either the Axis powers, by taking this island, would continue to press their offensive and Wavell's position would become even more tenuous or the British, by holding firm on Crete, would produce a reversal of their fortunes. Or so it might have seemed. As Porch explains, the outcomes of the attack on Crete were themselves extremely ambiguous.  <br /> <br />Still, the ability to look consistently for connections among disparate actions and events here is impressive, and is at the heart of what historians, especially those writing for a broad non-academic audience, ought to do.  <br />	2004-08-29

Wright Mills, and by his history of politics in the city of New Haven. <br />There has been a falling off in the quality of his work in recent years, although sometimes the old fire is still there.  In this book, I suspect, he is trying too hard to be accessible. <br />One of his points in this book is that the judicial review of legislative actions has gone too far -- federal judges regularly usurp the proper province of elected officials. This view, of course, is shared by many on both the left and the right. Each side believes, naturally enough, that the courts that strike down its favorite statutes are tyrannically usurping power.<br />In his discussions of judicial review, Dahl essentially alludes to issues that require careful consideration.  His allusions just contribute to his display of populist values and pessimism about their implementation.  They aren't analytically helpful.	2004-05-20

Skilling was never the chairman of the board of Enron.  He was the CEO and Kenneth Lay was the chairman.  <br />Lowenstein doesn't connect those dots. But he does ask us to consider \\"how inappropriate would the description President and Chief Justice sound, or Head Coach and Quarterback.  The board's job, like that of the coach, is to monitor those on the field....Indeed, the merging of these roles in America stands out as a unique institutional mistake.\\"  In his view it has helped create the star-quality of CEOs which in turn made star-worshipping investors eager to part with their bucks in return for overpriced stocks. <br />Lowenstein might have done something more than given Ken Lay this accidental pat on the back.  He might have offered some empirical evidence of the badness of such merging. He might, for example, have cited two corporations who faced similar circumstances otherwise - one with a chairman who was also CEO, the other with a severance of the two positions.  If the former company suffered from a bubble-and-bust that the latter company avoided, that fact would be germane for empiricists.  Or he might have referenced corporate earnings or productivity or any other measure of anything valuable tends to increase when the two roles are severed.   But he doesn't.  One need not expect empiricism from an author pushing a hot thesis.  <br />Instead, there is a good deal of discussion of the absurdly high salaries CEOs make these days, which prove (he thinks) that boardrooms have become excessively chummy places.  Indeed, he can play heads-I-win and tails-I-also-win.  If Skilling had been chairman as well as CEO, his subsequent indictment would show why those roles should never be combined.  But since in his case they weren't combined, the same facts show ... what?  Apparently that they should be occupied by non-chums, by people who are wary of one another.  <br />This is a demand that we don't make in the case of a head coach and a quarterback.  If they are both sharing in the credit for a winning team performance, they are likely to feel rather chummy.  As for their salaries, that will be determined by the supply of people capable of doing their jobs, and the demand for getting those jobs done.<br />Of course, in the case of Enron in early 2001, they were NOT getting the job done, they were only pretending to.  But Lowenstein doesn't have a handle on the whys and hows of that.	2004-04-02

There should have been some more maps..<br />There is a valuable chronological table in the front matter -- Cauvin doesn't remind you to make reference to it as often as he might, but it IS there.<br />On the whole, the book was an eye opener.  Cauvin makes a powerful case that there was a revolution in the way people think that preceded the various material elements in the Neolithic revolution, circa 10,000 BC.<br />First there came a consciousness of the divine -- goddesses showed up in carvings regularly enough to indicate a female monotheism. <br />This consciousness caused humans in the valley of the Jordan and in the plain of Aleppo to think of themselves as different from the natural world around them -- the gazelles and goats we hunt don't pray to the goddess, but we do, so we are obviously a different sort of being than they. <br />With that thought came a lot of others -- the deliberate cultivation of grain, the taming of those goats into herds, new sorts of architecture, including somne unnatural right angled corners.  <br />It was all coded, many millennia later, in Genesis.  Recognition of one's &quot;nakedness&quot; before God.  The end of the easy hunter/gatherer lifestyle.  Then Abel and the cultivation of grain.  Then Cain, his younger brother, and the cultivation of tame animals. <br />But why did this new consciousness happen anyway?  Cauvin doesn't offer any explanation.  Julian Jaynes tried to offer one, decades ago (the &quot;breakdown of the bicameral mind&quot;), subsequent developments in neurology haven't been kind, and he seems to have had the chronology a bit off, too.  <br />Maybe the goddess just chose that moment to reveal herself.	2004-03-09

In the world of finance, especially in the subfield of credit derivatives, the fact that different trading communities use different labels for the same trades and features causes no end of trouble and frustration.<br />Tavakoli wisely devotes a good deal of attention, then, to what names are and should be given to what things. <br />She begins her discussion of credit default swaps, for example, by discussing the standard terminology.  &quot;If the fee is paid up front, which may be the case for very short dated structures, the agreement is likely to be called a credit default option. If the fee is paid over time, the agreement is more likely to be called a swap.&quot;<br />She disagrees with this habit.  She would prefer to call a swap only if the parties are actually exchanging the credit default list of two different credits. Otherwise, &quot;cash flows paid over time are nothing more than an amortization of an option premium.&quot; <br />She explains why the usage that over-stresses that amortization came about.  Its because the desks at many banks where this work is done are occupied by former interest-rate-swap staff, so the ISDA terminology persists.	2003-09-01

For example, chapters 6 and 7 both deal with what Plantinga calls &quot;Bayesian coherentism,&quot; as a theory of warrant, but it doesn't seem to me that there is such a thing.  He creates a hypothetical theory of warrant out of a theory of probability associated with the 17th century clergyman Thomas Bayes.  Then he spends two chapters discussing a variety of problems some of them associated with real life Bayesians (arguing over matters other than warrant) and others associated with his hypothetical Bayesianism.  <br />Still, those who want a summary of a good part of the contemporary debate over epistemological questions will find it here, and you can use the footnotes to find other works in which to study the matters discussed with more depth. <br />I especially appreciatd the discussion of Laurence BonJour's version of coherentism. Plantinga finds BonJour's copmments on probability &quot;thoroughly obscure....That precisely THAT mosquito should bite you precisely when and where it does, that on your cross-country trip on December 23 ar 4:13 PM you should be precisely where you are at that time, that there should be precisely the number of blades in your backyard that in fact adorn it...either these things are all improbable in the relevant sense or else I have no idea what that relevant sense might be.&quot; <br />A good point, that, and well expressed.  Perhaps it was BonJour's problems with probability that stimulated the digression on Bayesianism.	2003-05-14

I do not share in the underlying philosophical position Mr. Ryan adopts as his own.  He is an admirer of Hegel, Royce, and other thinkers in that tradition, notably Blanshard, and those thinkers leave me cold.  I am an individualist pragmatist in the manner of William James.  There exists a wonderful old photo of James and Royce, who were friends, sitting on a stone wall together.  James has his mouth open and his hand is in the air gesturing.  A letter from the period explains that James said \\"Damn the Absolute!\\" just as the shot was taken. <br />I say all this as foundation for my real reason for writing.  One can learn from Ryan without agreeing with him.  I certainly did, and don't.  One can come to admire the thoroughness of the demolition job he does on Randian pretensions here, without accepting his alternative views. <br />My fellow Jamesians will be interested in Ryan's dissection of Ayn Rand's over-hyped effort at philosophy, not just because his references to his Hegelian point of view will remind us of the James/Royce quarrel, but because Ryan's focus upon Rand's philosophy is chiefly devoted to showing that she didn't understand the issues that she thought she was settling, and this he does quite well, rescuing the good name of epistemological reasoning from this low-rent version. <BR> <BR>He demonstrates that if she had understood the implications of her theory of measurement-omission in connection with the issue of universals, she would have attained not the wonderful novelty her acolytes attribute to her, but the re-invention of a theory expounded some years before her by Roy Wood Sellars, a moderate version of nominalism (much like the views on conceptualization and universals expounded in the conception chapter of James' classic on psychology, although Ryan doesn't mention that).	2003-05-01

To call him the \\"principal\\" is something of an understatement. Except for a part-time secretary, he IS Reindeer.<br />Even Mr. Schwager's first question, about the name of that fund, elicits a fascinating anecdote. It seems that Mr. Walton's great-grandfather, William Gladstone Walton, received the nickname \\"Reindeer\\" from his neighbors in northern Quebec.<br />One year (apparently 1920, although this is left indefinite), forest fires destroyed most of the vegetation and game of the region, and threatened the Indian and Eskimo population with starvation. William G. Walton convinced the Canadian government to finance a scheme of his to lead a herd of reindeer (plentiful in Alaska) across the north of the country into the deforested part of Quebec. The project took him five years, 1921-25, because reindeer are not cattle-moving only when they want to move-but he did succeed, introducing a substantial herd into Quebec, one that has flourished there ever since, and he became a local hero. <br />\\"I tell people that my great-grandfather added more value to society than I ever will,\\" said Mr.Walton, in concluding his explanation of his fund's name. <br />I think he was being too modest there.  Of course, an effective trader adds value to society without having to herd Donner and Blitzen through the arctic to do it-by getting investment capital into the hands where it will prove most productive, by helping a variety of enterprises manage their inevitable risks, and by contributing to the financial independence of his clients.	2003-04-23

In brief, it treats something human as if it were something mechanical.  Language is a way of conveying meanings from one human to another, and the most inflexible, most mechanical, most artifiial POSSIBLE way of looking at words is to classify them by their sound alone.  That's precisely what a pun does.  <br />When Mel Brooks is playing a Polish actor playing Hitler, he says: \\"All I want is peace.  A little piece of Poland, a tiny piece of France....\\"  That is amusing -- the juxtaposition of the vital and the mechanical.  <br />More sophisticated jokes than such puns are based on the same juxtaposition.

But it doesn't need to be. Mr. Gastineau's manual is directed chiefly at investment advisers and financial planners as a reference volume, and it serves that purpose quite well.

But this is always a tricky move, and the way Fish executes it leaves us with no glue to prevent the fissioning of \\"interpretive community\\" into factions of one, just so many obstreperous individuals with nothing more to say to each other, because each has his own (mutually contradictory) inward disposition, a self-reinforcing dogmatism in the light of which all evidence is interpreted.<br />This is not law nor is it literature. This is the chaos of competing autisms.<br />The way out of this chaos would take us through history. It would involve the realization that history is not simply a collection of texts. The execution of King Charles I was not a sentence in a book, \\"King Charles was beheaded today,\\" but was a real fleshy neck on a real block, as an axe swung through its downward arc. As a literary theorist, literary critic, and legal theorist, Fish has consistently dismissed the importance of such physical extra-textual events. It is no wonder that the texts become insubstantial if the world in which they are written is rendered insubstantial, too, so all we have is a group of graduate students sitting around in our own day gabbing about their own gabbling.	2003-03-05

It's a 9 inch tall candle.  I leave the room to go about some business and, when I return, I see that the candle is still burning.  It's now 7\\" tall.  Few people outside of philosophy seminars have any difficulty with my inference that at some point there was an unobserved 8\\" candle in that room.  <br />Indeed, I think that few philosophers have trouble with that, either.  What they do argue about, though, is what it means to say that.  What are we saying about ourselves and our relations to the rest of the world when we say we are sure there was an unobserved 8\\" candle (or one observed only by God, to include the Berkeleyans)? <br />The most interesting portion of this book traces the fate of that question in American philosophic history, subsequent to the death of William James in 1910.  The problems break down, roughly, this way.  Is one's initial perception of the 9\\" candle direct or mediated?   If one perceives candles directly, how are illusions or possible?  If one's perception is mediated, how is knowledge possible?  On a related point, are we to think of the common-sense candle, with its definite color and odor, as primary?  Or is the candle of a scientist, composed of electrons, protons, and a lot of empty space, more truly real?  Can we say that the common-sense candle exists when we're in the room but only the scientist's candle continues when we aren't there?	2003-03-05

But in June 1790, matters hadn't gotten that far.  Hamilton was trying to regularize the debts of the various states, incurred in the course of the revolution, consolidate them into one national debt and account for it responsibly.  This consolidation already looked suspicious to Madison and in THIS stage of the conflict, Jefferson appears not as a combatant but as the mediator.  <br />Ellis tells the story well, and insightfully.

Miller makes three large claims here.  I think he makes good on the first two.  I'm not so sure about the third, but even there he makes a case that needs to be made. <br />First, he explains that one branch of economics has become an experimental science.  <br />Second, he says that this variant of economics has produced important results - theorems disclosing how markets might best be structured or restructured, and how the privatization of now-public goods might be accomplished, in ways that could produce enormous productivity gains.  <br />He more pessimistically claims though, thirdly, that these theorems probably won't produce such gains, because in doing so they would hurt politically powerful interests. <br />The idea of \\"experimental economics\\" is simple enough: a college professor need only ask his students to co-operate in a simple auction-based game, so that he (and they) can observe the process by which prices come into existence under simplified conditions.  Once a body of observations has developed, he and other experimenters can vary the rules and conditions of the game and observe the effect the changes have upon the trading strategies of the players and the game outcomes.  <br />It was at Harvard University, in the 1940s, that such experiments got their start, in the classroom of Professor Edward Chamberlain.  In the decades since, a body of observations has developed that in some respects supports neoclassical economic theory, but that in one crucial respect calls for its modification.  Neoclassical theory needs to be modified to account for the possibility of irrational price bubbles.  What is of greater policy importance, though, is that post-Chamberlainian experiments have given us a good idea of how markets can be structured to prevent bubble formation.	2003-02-07

With that as an implicit focus, we frequently argue over where dams ought to be built, what fields ought to be irrigated and at whose cost, whether homes in flood plains ought to be insured at public expense, and so forth.  <br />Robert Glennon, a professor of law at the University of Arizona, James E. Rogers College of Law, wants to draw our attention to invisible water, and to the question how we might best avoid either polluting or running out of it.  <br />Early on, he tells the story of Ubar, a city of ancient Arabia, an oasis for the camel caravans of its time, and a place of fabulous wealth.  Scheherazade spoke of Ubar in one of her thousand-and-one tales, as did countless bedouins around countless campfires.  It became an Arabian Sodom, reputedly destroyed at the peak of its splendor by an angry God. What Glennon adds is that Ubar (in what we now call Oman) was a very real place.  <br />In the 1980s, an amateur archeologist, Nicholas Clapp, led an expedition that successfully located and unearthed the fortress that had once guarded the precious spring-fed well that had made the city a port of call for those desert-crossing voyagers.  It now appears that sometime between 300 and 500 AD, Ubar simply fell.  It collapsed of its own weight, into a huge underground limestone cavern - the cavern that its wells had progressively emptied of water.  The groundwater had held the city up, physically as well as fiscally.  So Ubar, having exended its capital, sank out of sight, and entered legend as the \\"Atlantis of the desert\\" (T.E. Lawrence's phrase.) <br />Glennon tells this story for the same three reasons that Scheherazade did: to charm, to instruct, to survive.	2003-01-18

After all, the price of X, like that of its underlying, is determined by the point at which the demand for X is equal to the supply of X. One doesn't need a computer for that, one just needs a liquid marketplace. I can look up the price of a share of Microsoft's equity in my daily newspaper. I'm not tempted to develop a body of theory to figure it out, when I can flip through a few pages and find it.<br />Nowadays, I can also look up the price of a standardized option to buy Microsoft in the newspaper. In 1973, when people like Fischer Black began developing this body of theory, that was not yet the case. <br />This brings us to the point of my little sermon. The purpose of this body of theory is to produce a price figure in cases where there is not a liquid market for X. The theories answer the question a portfolio manager must often ask himself: if I were able to find a buyer for X, how much could I charge for it? <br />This book has its moments, but in general I believe this body of theory accomplishes less than its adepts believe.

Thompson discusses a wide range of the issues that bear upon voting rights and procedures: the disenfranchisement of felons, partisan gerrymandering, the expressive value of private versus public campaign finance, and much else.  What he wants most is a broadened public deliberation about such issues.  He thinks that most debate has remained within the confines of legislative halls and the courts.  But \\"on the question of who should be a legislator, legislators are distinctly interested parties,\\" and the context of litigation, whether over statutory interpretation or the judicial review of an act's constitutionality, is a very severe limit on the range of discussion. <br />Instead,  Thompson, professor of political philosophy at the Center for Ethics and the Professions, Harvard University, wants the public to deliberate in \\"initiative campaigns, party conferences, voluntary associations, Internet chat rooms, high school classrooms, even talk shows.\\"   <br />This is unobjectionable enough.  After all, there seems to be plenty of discussion of just about everything in internet chat rooms and talk shows, and Thompson's agenda is more to my taste than many of those that are served abundantly now in either of those two forums!  <br />Unfortunately, though, when Thompson descends from advocating such debate to actually engaging in it, his own contributions can seem question-begging: \\"the largest group of citizens still denied the right to vote is convicted felons.  One study estimates that the laws excluding felons disenfranchised nearly 5 million citizens.  The traditional justifications for their exclusion - felons have broken the social compact and they are not virtuous citizens - do not seem compelling.  They do not support the permanent ban that many states, including Florida, have enacted.  Once felons have served their sentences, they should surely regain their right to vote.\\"<br />Why should this \\"surely\\" be the case?  It is not, after all, unusual for the punishment of a crime to involve several distinct deprivations,  some surviving after others have lapsed.  A stock broker convicted of insider trading may be imprisoned and informed that he will never again be allowed to register as a broker/dealer.  One does not often hear the complain that after he has walked out of prison, he should surely regain his right to broker stock.  There are simply different features of his punishment, one of which outlasts the others.   Whether one characterizes the reasons for his imprisonment as a \\"violation of the social contract\\" or as an inadequately virtuous citizenship (the two possibilities Thompson allows between his dashes) does not seem particularly crucial.  One's view of the lifetime ban on stock brokerage, or on voting, will turn on questions of appropriate punishment, or deterrence, and on whether the life-long restriction limits the felon's chances to do further harm.<br />Thompson apparently doesn't want to let himself be distracted into issues of crime and punishment, though, because his next paragraph begins, \\"Even if some restrictions on felons could be justified in principle, the effects in practice are likely to violate [the principle of] equal respect.\\"  <br />There are two effects-in-practice that he has in mind.  First, the ban on felony votes contributes to a racial imbalance in the electorate, because it  falls disproportionately on blacks and Hispanics.  Second, the ban affects innocent people, whose names sometimes mistakenly appear on the lists urged to purge the voting rolls of felons.  <br />The latter of those points is very weak.  Any system of criminal justice runs the risk of punishing the innocent.  There will be wrongful convictions, or bullets fired by law enforcement officers that may hit innocent parties, or accidents caused by highway police chases.  It is not clear to me how the particular harm to the innocent that concerns Thompson different in kind from any of those.  <br />His objection to the racially specific nature of the enforcement of such a policy is weightier.  Still, there is much more that he might have said to build it up, and objections left unaddressed.<br />Too much of the book is occupied with weightless arguments.  The fact that some solid points are score here and there isn't enough for me to recommend it.	2002-11-15

Part of the environmentalist &quot;litany&quot; that has led to so much deserved skepticism is that there is a devastating deforestation of the planet underway, with further obviously bad consequences for biodiversity.<br />Yet Lomberg observes that the UN climate panel, a standard source for the relevant statistics, relied upon often by his critics in their own writings, indicates that there is no net deforestation, and that in all likelihood the Earth will have more forests in 2100 than it had in 1950.<br />To this his critics often reply (as Lovejoy did, in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN panel, or lynch mob) that Lomberg is confusing &quot;tree plantations&quot; with real forests.  We are deforesting because we are substituting phoney forests for the real thing.<br />So they say.  But that revised version of the litany doesn't work either.  Lomberg antitipated it.  In this book he writes, &quot;But for one thing it is not obvious that plantations reduce overall biodiversity.  Certainly, they do have fewer species locally, but...they reduce the economic pressure on the natural forests.  As a result, these forests are better shielded, and support higher biodiversity,&quot; etc.  Unsurprisingly, he provides specific facts to back that up, too.<br />In all, this feels to me like real science, whereas the critics, who often claim that they have the &quot;defend science&quot; from such outsiders as this, sound like dogmaticizing Popes.	2002-05-31

He was surprised, he said, that &quot;in a city where proper and correct theatre is forbidden, coarse and silly farces as contrary to good taste as to good morals are permitted.&quot; <br />Rousseau was right to see elitism in those words.  The intellectuals of D'Alembert's crowd naturally thought that they could decide for everybody what it &quot;proper and correct,&quot; what is &quot;coarse.&quot; Rousseau was right, furthermore, to issue this counterblast.<br />I'm not an advocate of every sentiment here, but I think I get the general drift of Rousseau's contention about art, festivals, and the public good.  And I believe he got the better of the argument.	2002-05-01
