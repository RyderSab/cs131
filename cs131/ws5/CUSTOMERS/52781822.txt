When I first came across the Stargazer series, my first impression is that &quot;Oh no, not another series to follow!&quot;. I am also following the new Enterprise series and Capt Calhoun. I am a fan since STTOS, I had initially did not pay much attention to STTNG but after following the series, I feel it is the best of all the ST series so far. Because of this, my impression of Picard and his crew has always been on Enterprise D. Enterprise E did not form much of an impression.<br />Stargazer to me is a step on a ladder for Picard and did not warrant much attention. After reading this book and the previous one, I am more inclined to follow it a bit more closely.<br />This story again shows the ingenuity of Picard and his ability to triumph where others have failed. His crew is by far the most interesting (not the most colourful) when compared to Capt Calhoun's and Capt Archer's, at least in my opinion.<br />Picard was sent to hunt an outlaw. He was sent on a mission where he is expected to fail and take the consequences. A pawn in politics meant to bring down Picard's mentor. How well I can empthatise with his situation!<br />He triumphed despite uncertainties due to his inexperience. He grows more confindent with each encounter and there are leadership lessons within the story.<br />The story is fast paced and I went on reading till I complete the story. I am looking forward to the third one.	2002-05-12

John Montroll folds them using a single square. Quite a challenge since most of the models are not simple to fold.<br />Models in this book include tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, icosahedron, decahedron, double diamond hexhedron, triangular dipyramid, pentagonal dipyramid, hexagonal dipyramid, heptagonal dipyramid, triangular prism, pentagonal prism, hexagonal prism, sunken platonic solids and many others.<br />I prefer folding polyhedra using modular techniques since they end up much more colourful. In this book polyhedra are folded using a square and hence only in one colour.<br />At the end of the book, Montroll gives suggestions on how to expand on the techniques he uses in this book to create your own one piece polyhedra.<br />Yes, I recommend this book for polyhedra enthusiast.	2002-04-15

I have stopped reading comics for many years but still will not hesitate to pick up the ones I have around in the house to read them or buy them when they are packaged as a complete series.<br />I read the book and complete it in record time. I had difficulty putting it down. As I read the book, glimpses of spiderman history I know so well came up and so did nostalgia. The story is predictable so did the ending but still as a spiderman fan, I am satisfied.<br />I will not spoil the fun by telling the full story. It touches on the vulnerability of Peter Parker and his relationship with MJ (not Michael Jackson!) plus the evolution of the green goblin.<br />Reading storylines never spoil my experience of watching it in the cinema. If anything, it enhances it. By all means, if you are a spidey fan, read it.	2002-03-27

It was the last 2 pages of the story that raise the rating from 4 stars to 5. The author need not penned the last two pages but it is precisely these last 2 pages that bring a tear to my eye.<br />I have a particular fondness for Data and his evolution. I too have wondered why there only one android whereas there were many encounters of androids in the Star Trek world. The story woved a thread connecting many aspects of STTOS and STTNG and the creator of Data including Flint. After reading the story, somehow it seems logical, but why didn't I think of it?<br />If you like Data and would like some background on androids appearing throughout Star Trek time and space, check this book out.	2002-03-18

Most adults even begineers prefer simple models with a bit more details, something easy to identify and to fold. Most of the models can be completed in less than 10 steps. This book is definitely not for people who prefer complicated models and those looking for new models to try out.<br />The stories here stress is on holidays, Columbus Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, Christmas, Valentine's Day, Easter, May Day, and Mother's Day. In some instances, how the holiday arise would be described.<br />The usual flow goes as follows: The story would start, at a strategic point, a fold would be used to illustrate a step in the story. You will find that the story step synch very well with the folding step.<br />I find this book suitable for teachers who tell stories and wants to get the children to get more involve in the story. It is also suitable for teachers who teaches craft and wants to add another dimension into the craft.<br />The downside is that there are many cultures in this world that do not celebrate the holidays described, however, ideas gained can be easily adapted for other holidays suitable for your culture or country. The book is also rather expensive.	2002-01-01

Look at the picture on the cover of the book and you will know which of the 8 animals are. The rest of the book consists of templates you can use.<br />Look closely at the fish or koi. It is so realistic!<br />The lizard can be called an action model since its body and legs can be moved realistically like a lizard.<br />Only the bat is an origami bat but it is a compound model and again origami purist might not like it. It makes no difference to me since I first learned my origami models from Isao Honda's book. <br />I have a few books on this kind of paper craft and this book is among the best.	2001-11-14

Most adults even begineers prefer simple models with a bit more details in their models, something easy to identify. Of course there are adults to prefer the simple childish elegance of simple models. Most of the models can be completed in less than 10 steps. This book is definitely not for people who prefer complicated models and those looking for new models to try out.<br />I bought the book with the intention of looking for new ways to enhance the teaching of origami. Usually telling stories is not for me as I do not like to speak much.<br />I read some of the stories in the book and was very amused by the way origami is taught with stories. It was interesting enough for me to try it out. It was interesting enough for me to order the other 2 books on origami and story telling.<br />The usual flow goes as follows: The story would start, at a strategic point, a fold would be used to illustrate a step in the story. You will find that the story step synch very well with the folding step and it is rather amusing too. It could raise laughter among the children. The model can end with a twist.<br />I find this book suitable for teachers who tell stories and wants to get the children to get more involve in the story. It is also suitable for teachers who teaches craft and wants to add another dimension into the craft.	2001-11-10

Do not be put off by the name of the book or the word &quot;wreath&quot;.<br />How about words like &quot;brooches&quot;, &quot;garlands&quot;, &quot;motifs&quot;, &quot;rings&quot;?<br />How about &quot;frisbee&quot;?<br />I recommend this book for its simplicity. You need to learn to fold one unit from a selected model. Fold the same unit several times and join it to form a ring. Because of this repetition, it serve as good practice for a beginner or for children. it is good to get a group of children together and each one fold the same unit and with together form a beautiful ring. This is real team work!<br />Repeated folding also encourages mastery and this mastery is useful when you learn to fold other origami models later.<br />There are many beautiful rings and with the right colour, it is very attractive and eye catching. This goes well as part of a greeting card.<br />I had enjoyed folding many of the models within and used it as part of my origami display.	2001-08-04

Tomoko Fuse as usual do excellent origami.<br />The book is divided into 4 chapters:<br />Chapter 1: Card and Letter Holders (14 models) Chapter 2: For Use and Decoration (12 models) Chapter 3: Twinkling Stars (16 models) Chapter 4: Packages (14 models)<br />A lot of the models in this book is 2D and thus you can fold and send as presents or send it as a self made card. The result is very attractive. Some of it looks good on a dinner table when you have guests for special occasions.<br />I like the spectacularly beautiful stars, boxes and presents. The stars looks attractive when they form part of a card send to a love one.<br />All these models looks good when used to decorating your home.	2001-08-04

Boxes are also well liked by the masses but unfortunately most are unable to differentiate between one square box from another despite the differences in outward appearances in patterns or designs. Hence, if I need to quickly make simple boxes, this booklet is ideal and easy to carry with me.<br />Three kinds of boxes are taught with their variations, square boxes (with partitions), triangular boxes and hexagonal boxes. I missed the octagonal boxes which is a favourite of mine too. All boxes have lids included.<br />Tomoko has many designs but this booklet teaches the simpler ones but the effect is the same when compared with the more intricate ones.<br />I would strongly recommend this book even if you purchase every book on boxes churned out by Tomoko Fuse. I try to collect all of them and I still find this booklet worth it.	2001-08-04

With some help from a parent, and some bonding time, this will definitely raise a smile.<br />I too have enjoyed folding it and teaching it.	2001-08-04

I am an admirer of his works and have attempted to collect all books by him.<br />There is a lot of mathematics involve so for those who like to combine mathematics and origami, this is a good book to add to your collection. If you are just interested in origami and not mathematics, perhaps, you might consider browsing it at your local book stores before deciding.<br />The models within are not really that amazing, in fact rather simple. These simple models are being used to illustrate the mathematics involved in the folding of the models.<br />The 5 platonic solids (tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron) are introduced here, the mathematics involved and how to fold it. They are very attractive to fold if the right colours are chosen. Boxes, stars, tangrams and other geometric solids are included. Most of these can be used for decorations other than studying the mathematics involve.<br />Whether you think this book is worth getting will depend a lot on your interest.	2001-08-04

This is because it reminds me of the days when I would receive an encyclopaedia as a birthday present and would spend many pleasant hours looking at the photographs and reading it.<br />It starts of with an excellent introduction to origami. It gives history, followed by a gallery of origami masterpieces. Next it discuss what paper, techniques and basic folds are required. I like the part where the various types of paper were introduced.<br />The sections is divided to<br />1) Traditional Classics (crane, cup, lily, samurai hat, kimono, crown, sanbo, waterbomb, peace dove, sampan, masu box)<br />2) Animals, People and Flowers (nun, butterfly, swan, scottie dog, buttonhold flower, rooster, human figure, shell, goldfish, rabbit, tulip and vase, elephant, peacock)<br />3) Toys, Games &amp; Action Origami (jumping frog, glider, banger, stackers, barking dog, zoomerang, tumblewing, nodding dog, magic star/frisbee, pecking crow, flapping bird, talking frog, catapult and basketball hoop, moving lizard)<br />4) Practical Paper Folds (page corner, letterfold, pin tray, the ellington, lazy susan, photoframe, square bix, business card holder, heart coaster, easter basket, pinwheel and puzzle purse, gift bag)<br />5) Party Tricks (Laughter lines, fortune teller, dollar shirt, envelope trick, blinking eyes, strawberry, kissing lips, money pig, newspaper hats, the captain's shirt story)<br />6) Decorative Origami (sailboat, hanging decoration, bangle, bishop's mitre napkin, pixie boot napkin, swan napkin, rose napkin christmas stocking, gift tag, pop-up flower, button flower, paper chain, heart ring, star, santa and sleigh)<br />7) Modular origami (spinner, butterfly ball, Japanese brocade, five intersecting tetrahedra. modular star, modular cube, kusudama, fireworks)<br />Instructions are in the form of photographs not diagrams. In general most of the models are easyto fold. There are enough difficult ones to challenge the more adventurous.<br />As I had been folding for over 30 years, I have seen most of the models before. As I prefer simple folds (easier to teach beginners), this book brings together many old favourites in one book with some new ones of course. I find this book complement Dave Petty's book, Origami, very well.<br />I would recommend this book as a lovely present and a good introduction to origami.<br />As for myself, I plan to get a second copy.	2001-08-03

I was suitably astonish and amused by the origami subjects within. If I have to choose one word to descibe the book, it would be &quot;quirky&quot;.<br />For those who have been purchasing origami books and getting the usual stuff and would like some unusual subjects, this is definitely the book!<br />Within the book is divided into 4 main sections: 1) Origami Action (32 models) 2) Symbols, Signs &amp; Stunning Designs (21 models), 3) Models from the Heart (15 models) and 4) Origami for the Almost Deranged (21 models). Most of the subject matters cannot be found elsewhere, in any other origami books.<br />I find the general format and presentation of the book rather unusual too, rather refreshing. Throughout the book, for every models, there is a section &quot;Thoughts behind the fold&quot;. This allows you to get into the mind of the author and possibly ideas for creating your own models.<br />There are so many models that I am unable to list all of them. Among my favourites are a workable Swiss Army Knife, a nail clipper and slithering snake skin! There are also a lot of action models and this suits me very well as I like action models.<br />The general complexity ranges from simple to complex. On a range of 1 to 5, with simple (1) and complex (5), I find that most of the models fall in the range of 2. Do not let this fool you, simple models can be very effective and fun to fold too. The final result is astonishing and amusing, much more so that some complex models.<br />I like to mention too that I had fun with the running car, hey!, running on legs, not wheels! Then you will be taught how to fold the carbon atom that even a rocket scientist could not fold. Do not forget to try folding the invisible duck too! It's a riot!<br />Hey! as I am already almost deranged, folding from the book maintained me in the same deranged condition. Perhaps all you almost deranged origami enthusiasts would like to group together and form the ADOES (Almost Deranged Origami Enthusiasts Society).	2001-07-05

As usual I have always looked forward to Montroll's books.<br />Even after getting this one, I cannot help but wonder what he will come up with next.<br />A general comment is that is book's models is of intermediate standard, similar in standard and style to Montroll's recent books. The birds can be classified as slightly below the intermediate standard suitable for beginners who wants to try something a bit more difficult. Compared to his first book &quot;Origami for the Enthusiasts&quot; and &quot;Animal Origami for the Enthusiasts&quot;, Montroll's two outstanding books, the models within are of slightly lower standard. I believe Montroll is capable of doing better that is why I keep looking forward to his new books and purchasing every one in the market.<br />In this book, Montroll tackle the subject on insects which he has yet to do so in other books. Although the final product's standard is below what I expected, nevertheless, the insects have all the necessary body parts and they are not too difficult to fold. I have seen some of Montroll's insects and I had high hopes when I saw the title of his new book.<br />For birds, you will find models on goose, cardinal, crow, snipe, ibis, flamingo, ostrich, pheasant, quetzal, pelican, turkey, woodpecker, goose with outstretched wings, pigeon, humming bird, vulture, robin, crane, parrot and stork. None of these models caught my eye and cause me to sit down immediately to fold it. My favourites are pheasant, humming bird, pigeon and cardinal. I like folding birds.<br />For insects, you find scavenger beetle, ladybird, fly, spider, wasp, long-horned beetle, earwing and butterfly. Again nothing here caught my eye. Sorry if I am difficult to please. I cannot help but compare this to Kawahata's Insects.<br />Overall, if I were to compare this book with other Montroll's books, I will give this 3.5 out of 5 but compare with other origami books in the market, I will give this a 4.5 out of 5. Hence I rate this with 5 stars.<br />This book is still a good investment for origami enthusiasts.	2001-06-20

You tear out the paper, cut and fold it. The paper is not quite square the the picture is not exact. A lot adjusting to fit the colours is required. There is a lot of cutting involved but the folding is very simple. The final shape is very simple too and not easily recognisable if there is no picture of the pokemon on it. The picture can be just a face or full and need mounting on a flat surface for it to look good since generally it cannot stand.

I felt very happy and contented at the end of the story. One question kept popping in my mind was &quot;Where is Lennier?&quot; I had predicted that Lennier would be the one who saved David thus redeeming himself.<br />This last book of the trilogy is the best of the three. In fact, one of the top 3 books written about the B5 universe. The prophecy of G'kar and Londo came to pass. Delenn met the earlier incarnation of Sheridan. David grew up, got infected and was subsequently saved. Vir had risen to the occasion &amp; succeeded Londo as the next emperor and along the way showed why he deserved to be an emperor. Even Timov got her wish.<br />The story started off with an unforgettable scene which gave me a deep sense of nostalgia. Take this scene... Sheridan referred to G'kar as &quot;the king's hand&quot;. Delenn did not understand and Sheridan explained<br />&quot;Ancient kings had men known as their 'hands'. They would go into the field and do dirty work... The hand was the most trustworthy and dependable of the knights&quot;.<br />&quot;That is interesting to know, Your Highness&quot;, Delenn said with open amusement, and bowed deeply. Sheridan had rolled his eyes and ... &quot;<br />I just love the exchange, it is so typical of Sheridan-Delenn relationships.<br />Later, Delenn referred to G'kar as Sheridan's leg!<br />Typical again. Reminds me of the &quot;motor-butt&quot; joke. Peter Davis shows great understanding of the characters and the relationships between them.<br />The story is fantastic. Lots of pieces of the jigsaw puzzle is being placed together. Different events at B5 we see in the episodes are being tied together as a continous story.<br />I agree with one reviewer's comment about Sheridan being badly presented and two dimensional but then I view the story as being presented from the Centauri point of view.<br />G'kar is my favourite character and his sense of humour and irony comes through. Londo is the usual tragic figure being controlled by the Drakh.<br />I had thought the story of David can be a bit more exciting that what was covered by the book, a sort of let down.<br />Now the unresolved stories of B5 universe left are probably:<br />1) The Telepath War 2) What happened to Lennier? How did he redeem himself? 3) The journey of G'Kar and Lyta 4) The saving of Earth from the Drakh virus (too bad Crusades was cancelled, perhaps the stories can be continued via novels?)<br />The whole trilogy comes highly recommeded, particularly if you are a B5 fan and like to know some other behind the scene story not covered by the episodes.	2000-11-23

The models folded has a lot of practical applications. In general, if you use the correct colours in folding the model, you can get a really effective and eye catching model.<br />There is section on Christmas decorations which I use even today. Use bright shiny paper and hang up the origami decorations on your Christmas tree and listen to the &quot;oohs&quot; and &quot;aahs&quot; of kids as they admire the decorations. The decorations come in many shapes and often require more than a piece of paper to fold. This is a blessing since this allows you to control the colour of the model. They are usually very easy to fold although assembling it could present a challenge to begineers.<br />An excellent book for begineers keen to fold their own decorations.	2000-10-30

Of course not to mention, packaged in a colourful and attractive manner.<br />Would be a good book for beginners and a present for a kid.	2000-10-30

Long before this book, long before I met him in person. I get to try out his creations via many sources, long before he collected all this creations and published it in this book.<br />There are over 80 models in this book for you to try out covering the various aspects of origami like modular origami, animal origami, geometric origami and others. Theories are also being discussed. These include Thoughts on Diagramming, Modular Theories, Wet Folding Techniques, Square vs Equilateral Triangle, Rules Traditional and Personal and Ideas for Creative Approach. <br />All these makes the book well rounded and covering the latest techniques and ideas. <br />Animals and human figures found in this book is really fantastic. If you are lucky enough to find this book in a book store, flip through it, make sure you look at the coloured photos. You will be amaze. I have many favourites in this book. I am still folding the horse which starts from an equilateral triangle. It is one of the liveliest origami horse around, either jumping or running, unlike other origami horses which are rather sedate. There are also other fantastic models such as lion, lioness, elephant, just to single out a few. Dave's rhino if folded properly looked as if it is challenging you and contemplating whether to run you down or not. Dave's modular origami is equally fantastic. Quite a challenge. <br />A number of creations start from the silver triangle, that is, the A4 or A5 or A6 dimension, that is, the ratio of one side to the other is root 2. <br />I would recommend this book to anyone, after all it is Dave Brill-iant Origami.	2000-10-30

If not for the discovery of this book, my interest in origami would have been lost.<br />The models are still very fresh even for the origamist of today. There is a very good range from traditional models, simple models to the intermediate stage. An excellent first introduction to origami.<br />It contains works of experts who are not around today. Among my favourites are those by Ligia Montoya. Simple but extremely effective.<br />Nowadays origami experts tend to concentrate on details making folding the models extremely difficult for a beginner. I prefer to concentrate on representing the subject just right with just the sufficient details to differentiate the model and avoiding the complexity of folding it.<br />There are also models with sufficient difficulty to challenge the slightly more experienced.<br />A must for all enthusiasts.	2000-10-30
US	52781822	R3IU5Z5R015WER	0486411575	501252225	Dollar Bill Animals in Origami (Dover Origami Papercraft)	Books	5	45	45	N	N	Best origami book so far using dollar bill	Skill Level: Simple to Intermediate<br />Models avaliable include sailboat, fish, starfish, seahorse, shark, duck, swan, owl, parrot, toucan, penguin, sparrow, crane, rooster, snake, turtle, apatosaurus, triceratops, pig, sitting cat, dog, mouse, rabbit, unicorn, horse, cow, kangaroo, elephant, rhinoceros, deer, camel and giraffe.<br />This book contains all the Montroll's typical subjects but with a twist. They are folded not using the usual square piece of paper but with a dollar bill which is a rectangle with the ratio of 1:2.35. Although the book teaches you how to approximately cut rectangles to the approximate size, this destroys the uniqueness of folding using money. The main problem is that not all paper money has that ratio. In Singapore, the paper money here has the ration of 1:2. Still despite the same boring Montroll's subjects, it is still very interesting and fun to fold using paper money. It is a subject worth pursuing since you can surprise people when you pay using origami animals made from paper money. Problem is the person collecting the money may want to unfold and ensure that your money is good.You can delight kids when you give them money in the form of origami models. Who knows it just might encourage them to save. <br />Overall, I like this book despite the same boring subjects. My favourites are the turtle and the penguin. The book surprise me by the range of topics that could be folded using paper money. I have quite a number of books on folding using paper money and I rate this the best one of all.<br />Strongly recommended for the potential fun it could generate and it is not that difficult to fold since there are various levels of difficulty.	2000-10-28

I like it so much that I ordered another 2 more books.<br />Why? The photos are breath taking. Now it makes it very easy for me to answer what can you fold in origami. It makes it very easy for me to show that origami is not 'kid's stuff' but a serious art form. My additional copies will be brought to future origami exhibitions to show to visitors. I cannot bring the first one as it was signed by the author himself.<br />The depth and scope covered by the book shows the depth and scope of origami. Do not expect to learn origami through folding from the book. Expect to be brought spellbound into the beautiful world of origami.<br />It is definitely a collector's item.	2000-10-28

People  who have folded many of Montroll's models would know what I mean.<br />I have  all if not most of Montroll's books. His later books generally do not rate  higher than &quot;Origami for the Enthusiast&quot; or &quot;Animal Origami  for the Enthusiast&quot;.<br />I would prefer if he is able to put in at least  three or more extra complex models like his lobster, crab and stegosaurus  in every new book he produces.<br />This book generally follows the same  pattern as most of his books and the models are in the intermediate range.  The wet folding technique mentioned in the book does not raise this book  above his other books (note I compare with his other books, not origami  books in general). I did not see any new models which makes me excited and  wanted to fold immediately. I will probably keep this book for a slow  day.<br />If you are new to Montroll's models, this book would interest you  and recommended. If not, it depends on you, a Montroll fan or not. The  usual topics are there. Montroll's models are usually easy to follow and  fold and a worthwhile book to purchase for those who have not seen that  many Montroll's books.<br />John Montroll, if you are reading this, I am  waiting for Montroll to produce a book on origami insects and/or origami  vehicles. Remember to add at least 3 super complex models to satisfy old  time fans like me.<br />Thanks.	2000-03-10

This first book introduce the lore without going into too much detail. It tries to project a mystery but failed. I believe a better job would have been  done if it were 4 stories instead of 2 half stories. There is not enough  time to build up the tension and then resolve it spectacularly. Spock could  come up with some kind of theory but here he is not up to his usual high  standards. He seems lost and do not know what to do. The mystery remains  unresolved as it should be. What to show for this story is a lot of sick  people.<br />Next came Picard and his crew. This story is a lot better, in  fact the best of the 4 stories. Again the mystery was not resolved, lots of  sick people again.<br />I had hoped for a more spectacular reason to the  Badlands, something into like an super alien experiment gone wrong, a tear  in space-time fabric (again?), some new way for travel can be devised from  learning the secrets of the Badlands, etc.<br />I feel that the story could be  better, perhaps we can have another series but giving a different  explanation?	2000-01-17

Since each of these reviews tells you what the book is about, I will tell you how I feel about the book without the details of the book which is covered in other  reviews.<br />When I bought this book, I had expected more. Although each  story gives an insightful detail of the different lives of Dax, I cannot  help ending each story a bit disappointed. I had hoped for more details on  each one of those lives. I suppose this cannot be helped as there is only  one book to take in all the details. There is no real build up of tension.  They are just stories of each of the lives of Dax. There are a number of  excellent stories and I agree with most of the review. I posted an average  rating because I feel the book tries to do too much with so little space  and came up lost.<br />I would still strongly recommend this book to anyone  who would like to read more about Dax.	2000-01-17

Again, I feel that the story would fare better if they were complete stories in their own right, that is, written in two books rather than halves.<br />The first story is more on the Marquis and Paris rather than on  the Badlands itself. Nothing new is introduced. I would have loved a more  detailed story of the hide and seek in the Badlands before the Voyager  disappeared. I find it rather difficult to believe that Spock and Data were  not able to come up with the explanation of the Badlands that Janeway  could.<br />The explanation of the Badlands is quantum singularity. That's it.  I really mean that's it. There is no further expansion on this matter to  describe QS. Next Romulans are expert in QS and they can capture it. That's  really stretching it. It's like capturing the whole universe. A capture  went wrong and the QS is be passing through the federation. huh? I thought  the Badlands is where is always is and if the QS is causing the Badlands,  how can it move?<br />Sisko was able to use Romulan's technology and move the  QS away from Federation territory. Huh? What happen to the Badlands now  that the QS has disappeared or re-directed? Has it become the  Goodlands?<br />I find this last story the weakest of all leaving so many  holes and even for people like me who would like to stretch the imagination  when reading scifi, I find the idea of capturing QS rather ridiculous.	2000-01-17
US	52781822	R3QIQHC4OUHHJS	0870409573	57484426	Origami Hearts	Books	5	3	3	N	N	For the young at heart	This origami book is very specific in nature, aimed at folding hearts. Such themed origami books are rare. This book is ideal for creative people who wishes to make something for their loved ones. There are many ways to  create something different all from the same theme. Note that the completed  model can be combined with other creative pursuits to make something  spectacular, or just a nice postcard to a loved one. I would definitely  recommend this book to people who would want to show their love in some way  or send a card or a small gift to someone dear.	2000-01-17

I find this book poor and does not seem to belong to the series. Riker seems to be out of character, meets the crew of USS Excalibur, Capt Calhoun's ship and gets into humorous situations and he says 'I just got to  get off this ship!' upon meeting Exalibur's command staff. Riker is there  only for comic relief. There seems to be a lot of discussion of this  sex-bomb. Too much seems to dwell on issues that does not concern plague.  It took a long time before I realise the architect of the plague was being  referred to and this story is where the villain gets defeated. A real  let-down for an ending after the build-up in the earlier stories.<br />Note  that Riker is my favourite character in STTNG series and I like Capt  Calhoun too. Peter David is also one of my favourite Star Trek  author.<br />This story is such a let down.	1999-09-03

Tuvok gets recruited and has to work with Picard and Jack Crusher. (Do not understand why Beverly Crusher is with Tuvok on the cover, I suppose no one knows how  Jack Crusher looks like). The story is rather slow and unexciting as it is  highly predictable. Two species at a peace meeting, shouts at one another,  a third party under cover causes trouble for each side and each side blames  the other and threaten war. Along comes Picard trying to make peace,  naturally he will fail at first, then he succeeds and the bad guy is  captured. Highly predictable, no suspense element. 'First Virtue' gets a  few mention.	1999-09-03

This task was assigned to her in between Season 2 and 3 as she leaves the Enterprise D and Dr Beverly Crusher arrives to replace her. I like the  protrayal of Dr Pulaski as a no nonsense doctor. She tells Kira off when  Kira wanted to pull off her own agenda to reveal the brutality of  Cardassian rule. I like the character of Dr Pulaski and I was glad to see  her back in action.	1999-09-03

This story also touches on how he join the Marquis. He is captured by Chakotay and was on a ship with other members of the Voyager  team before they disappeared. This story describes how Chakotay faces  various threats to accomplish an errand of mercy. I find the story good.	1999-09-03

Just a story about how Beverly struggles to find the cure. After reading it was easy to forget. The mystery was how the virus could get past the bio-filters.

The protrayal of Spock especially McCoy was the way I  remembered him. Most nostalgic as I like the character of Dr McCoy very  much. It was also of a story of an ensign who tries too hard to please and  the sacrifices made and this ensign finally grew up to become a responsible  person.	1999-09-03
