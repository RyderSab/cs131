Say it ain't so!seen today for the lackeys of money and power they really were.Has science in general come to this?As merely another tool for politicians,ideologues and wackos with some agenda?Say it ain't so,science!

Thanks to John McWhorter for having the courage and honesty to write this book.He writes of things that are desperately overdue to be talked about;things that our politically cockeyed and o so correct times have wholly failed to address.Thanks to Mr.Mcwhorter for tearing into those who would perpetuate the &quot;I'm a victim&quot; syndrome for their own selfish interests(the Reverend Sharpton and his ilk).I personally have seen the anti-intellectualism and cult of victimology that pervades inner city students especially.I went to school with many kids who were afraid to succeed for fear of what their &quot;homeboys&quot; might think of them.So much wasted potential and time-it is sickening to think about.One thing that Wcwhorter could have gone into depth about but didn't, was how the mass media portrays the only successful black Americans as football and basketball players,and ignores the sizable contributions of black scientists,doctors,lawyers,educators and many other professionals.This book will anger you,make you question the motivations of the same old talking heads rehashing the same old politics that has yet to provide solutions, and it offers hope that people are waking up to the fact that the past cannot be used as an excuse for failure.Most of all it shows that the saviors and sheisters(one and the same usually)and papa government and its endless programs will not cure the problems so long in the making.This book is a wake up call for our society in general and the black community especially.	2001-11-25

This book doesn't disclose(a few trivial particulars aside) anything any halfway observant person doesn't already know.Any group,nation,idea,institution or any other organized power that becomes overwhelmingly powerful will necessarily become a force of tyranny.History is filled with the bloodshed,strongarming,propagandizing and all too typical result of one idea,nation or some other force having gained too much power.And of course at the height of its rule few people dare call the beast by its real name.This nation has long been on the path to becoming the enbodiment of evil that we ascribe to powers of the past.Remember that little episode called &quot;manifest destiny&quot;;or,more properly put-the slaughterfest and land theft and genocide of the Indian nations?In fact,we succeded where the Nazi's failed.The Nazi's didn't finish exterminating the Jewish race or their ancient way of life.We however took all the Indian lands that were worth a spit,destroyed their cultures and the greatest thing of all was that we came out looking like the good guys!Truly a hair-raising feat of inverted morality and skilled propaganda.Admirable in its devilishness,don't you think?We have never been moral.That too is a fairy tale and idealism.Every entity that has power to be used,whether on the individual level or on the societal level,the results will always be the same.If some nation went to war and defeated the U.S. tomorrow the general state of human civilization will not have changed one iota.When humans have power it will be abused.A far greater book could be written on whether or not humankind is inherently evil,stupid,greedy,terminally shortsighted or just a dressed-up chimpanzee with a load of moral pretensions and justifications in his head so he can go about the business of stealing,killing,lying,cheating,robbing and raping his fellows as he has been busy doing since (and before)recorded history.There is no such thing as an altruistic structure of power.Even those that start off beningly end up worrying more for their own self interests above all else.The human animal is naturally selfish.Love and self sacrifice do exist,but in the unconquerable need to satisfy the self others usually must come second.Apply this to large institutions,governments,big business all fighting for control of one another at home and those abroad,often with big money up for grabs, and you have what cannot be anything other than war,exploitation,propagandizing to the public and a disregard for human beings lives and rights if the unfortunates happen to be troublesome or an obstacle to the objectives of this or that entity of power.But this is ancient evil.Unvanquishable evil.Read the first three chapters of Ecclesiastes to discover or remind yourself of what the ancient preacher wrote and anguished over more than 3,000 years ago.It's truth is eternal.	2001-11-21
