I will be keeping it in my library instead of selling it back to the bookstore - and that says a lot!	2003-12-30

(Dr. Seuss's Book of Ridiculous Rhymes)	Books	4	2	3	N	N	I love it....... but she doesn't	I love reading this book to my two year old - but she never lets me finish it - instead giving me a different book to read.  I sincerely believe it is because she is at a stage of learning real words, and so many words with no meaning either don't intrest her or she just doesn't understand. I think it is definitely for older kids, maybe 3-4 that can understand the difference between words they haven't learned yet and words that are just made up and not real.	2003-12-30

I like it because the flaps are all shaped differently and are at odd angles.  The illustration is cute too, and the last page has all the animals lined up so you can count them, and review names and sounds.	2003-12-30

Seeing all her friends from Blue's Clues makes it interesting, and the colors are bold and the illustrations just like the show.  The jillions of flaps are just what my curious girl needs.  Many of the flaps are bent or missing now, but I plan to just buy a new one when it gets too beat up.  It's a very large book though, can be hard to tote around when your on outings or trips.	2003-10-06

I enjoyed this book because it tells the life of Jesus with an emphasis on the fact that he was a human being, like all of us.   like the blatantly sacraligious scenes of Joseph and Mary having sex, or Jesus becoming aroused when he sees a naked woman for the first time.  It reveals his human emotions, his fears and doubts.  He questions God and his reasons every step of the journey - a message that told me that it is in our nature to doubt, and God or whatever there is wants us to constantly question our existence - or else there is no reason to live. <br />Saramago's sense of humor and creativity come out in the conversations between Jesus, God, and the Devil.  The dialouge seems just perfect, and I wouldn't be surprised if that is exactly what was said.  <br />Full of great twists and drama ... even though we all know the ending, I couldn't put it down.	2003-09-17

I think the other comment about it not being realistic is a little un-thought out.  Even with the technology today, we would still be scared to death of an epidemic of this kind, and would likely do all of things which Saramango depicts.  I think this book takes a good look at human nature and what drives us - greed, pride, envy and lust.  The ending left me satisfied too.  Recommended	2003-04-12

I read this when I was pregnant and thought it was sound advice, but after I had a baby I realized the book should have been thrown out the window.  Maybe British babies and American babies are different or something, but I could never get my baby back to sleep in the middle of the night by patting her on the back.  The thing I found was true is the E.A.S.Y routine, which my baby fell into on her own - I didn't make her do it.  So, the author acts as thought she invented it or something.  I'm sure that many mothers use it like a baby Bible, but I just found it to be ridiculous.	2002-12-26

You learn to love Dinah early in the story and wish she would never grow up - but she must stand the trials of her mothers before her and learn her place in the universe as a mother, daughter, wife, and sister.  Don't listen to people complaining about the lack of biblical accuracy - that's why it is called \\"BIBLICAL FICTION\\"  and the Bible is mostly fiction anyway so I don't know what the big deal is.  I initially thought it would be very religious, but there is no propaganda in it. I am not Jewish or Christian, but I found the story captivating and finished in just a couple of days because I couldn't put it down.	2002-08-25
