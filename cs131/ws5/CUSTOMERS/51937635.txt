I also went through a time where I was very down and negative. One day I decided to change my life by changing my thinking. I read books on attitude and  listened to motivational tapes until I did indeed, change my thoughts and  change my life. I also made a commitment years ago to dedicate my life to  helping others realize that we create our own destinies.
