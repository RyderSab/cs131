But outside of that narrow zone of reference, \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" is fatally shrill, a hard, thin mat on which to lie. The streaky \\"humor\\" of the book - and here is where it severely disappoints - is conceived entirely in the author's imagination of self, and wholly for his benefit, not ours. The great lesson I learned from this novel is the inescapable danger writers wade into when they affix self-deprecation to vainglory. And is there anything more tedious than listening to someone talk about themselves for hours on end?	2005-10-08

Thompson bravely partied with the notorious gang for some time, presumably in an effort to humanize, demystify and, I guess, understand this bunch. He finds the humanity but also is witness to the raw, booze-fueled aggression so inherent in an organization of self-described outlaws. The vignettes satisfy, but the book has a sarcastic, braggadocios edge to it that distracts. He adopts a nauseating You-Had-To-Be-There voice early on that cheats the book of authenticity. A bright point was that Thompson is ultimately circumspect about his experience with the bikers, tossing off a well-reasoned psychological profile of his subjects' outcast leanings.	2005-09-18

The undeniable core of the famous book - inhabited supremely by Ignatius J. Reilly - represents some of the finest imagination and humanity put to paper in American literature. Nothing like a deliciously insane, absurdly overeducated, overfed main character to pillar a story. Ignatius is elegantly drawn, his every movement and word perfectly, wildly entertaining. The other parts of the book sag and bore by comparison. Jumbled, ugly, dead-end dialogue, an abundance of overly silly misadventures and a story arc that never snaps to life.	2005-09-17

It is the story of two good men, who, through a series of horrible events, endure difficult tests. One falls apart relatively early and the other, ensconced in his own \\"temple\\" of faith, only turns bitter at the very end. By that time the other man, severly disfigured and by now a gutter drunk, has turned a corner and comforts the dying and formerly faithful man to find a peace of his own. It is a story about growing up, heartbreak and hard living, woven together in clear-eyed flashbacks that bring the avid reader to a white-hot, emotional finale. A stirring work on every count. <br /> <br /> <br />	2005-09-09

The panorama of scenery, folkways and crusty dialogue pleases thoroughly. If all that is the flicking flame of \\"Ace,\\" the historical background Proulx provides is the furnace of embers that gives off the real heat. She writes fantastically about regional origins and eccentricities. On a down note, the plot is by and large flimsy - a clockwork series of events that ultimately feels very canned.	2005-08-28

Nothing revolutionary in Frankfurt's eye-catching little book, but it deftly examines a timeless subject with wit, insight and brevity.

So he aims for both - in miserable spurts that completely fog the history of this madman and of modern terrorism itself. Rarely are the Jackal's motivation and vision clear. Even muddier is the larger story of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the U.S.' growing intervention in Mideast politics and the backlash therein.

Highly readable, it has a force and sharpness of focus to it that is undeniable. The terse, detached vignettes build what you might call a unifying vibe, if not an altogether cohesive story.

Yes, maybe the best damn kind, for a man like Henry Chinaski has a lot of time on his hands to drink, think, write and dream. In a post-modern miracle of circumstances and luck, Chinaski manages to worry only about his hungers. The rest is irrelevant. From this blank slate springs a philosophy, a story, of a singular man - selfish, mean, loving and brilliant. A shining example of the memoir novel.	2005-08-12

But Palahniuk is a short order cook serving up thin, insufficient burgers whose only flavoring is a slathering of ketchup. You can salt bad food to save it, but that doesn't make it worth swallowing.  <br />This is less an act of literature than a smart-alecky rant. A rant that is neither new nor funny nor intriguing. It is insufferably trite - to the point of being numbing - and coarsely, cheaply repetitive. We're a culture hung up on looks, on money, on fame, on competition, on faith - repulsively so, farcically so. Yeah, so what? That is the ear-splitting sermon of this tiresome book.	2005-08-09

Clever story, really. Because I work in journalism, there was a special delight in the novel's contempt of 24-hour cable news, specifically, and of media sensationalism in general. And because I treasure all my body parts, it was intriguing to read a tightly researched book centered on a character who has lost one of his. But somehow the three story lines (Wallingford's rising and falling career, his lost hand and his found love) seem preposterously stitched together - kind of a Frankenstein book about too many things. Irving is a master writer of particular renown, but \\"The Fourth Hand\\" has virtually no surprises and offers up only middling literary value after the first act. The very arc of the story announces itself relatively early on and the characters, because they stay so rigidly on course, fail to interest.	2005-08-06

It is not important to me that some of the hard facts were massaged a little to allow a novel to be written. Robertson is a professor of the Civil War and there is no reason to believe he has twisted any large political or historical truths here. The author makes it clear he is writing fiction - so cries of inaccuracy are wholly misplaced. The book has the same natural weaknesses that any novel might suffer from: at times trite, wooden language and sub-par character development.	2005-08-03

The privations therein make for good reading, an education. But couldn't any fresh prisoner with good note-taking skills have written so dryly about 21 days behind bars? The celebrated novelist comes off as polite enough and it's an achievement that such a spoiled man could make so many friends inside. The big failure of \\"A Prison Diary\\" is that he spends so much time defending himself against his critics, but doesn't so much as acknowledge the crime that actually sent him to jail. Not one word. This was an unforgiveable omission that strangled the otherwise honest effort. All I needed was half a page explaining what, exactly, the crown had charged him with. I would have taken his word if he claimed injustice, but he never even had the grace to do that. To this day, I still don't know anything about his court case.	2005-07-23

Shift it around carefully, mindful of its cool threat to your tender flesh. This is the experience of reading \\"Cockpit,\\" which tempts and seduces, but ultimately mangles your sense of peace. Much like his earlier \\"Steps,\\" the book turns on what the desperate (or the simply sick) resort to when there is little to lose.

The main character's a dard-drinking Vietnam vet private detective who's been hired to track down a hard-drinking World War II vet who happens to write pulp novels and Nobel Prize winning poetry - on the 15 days of the year he manages to stay sober. He locates his prey on page one, dead drunk in a bar near Oakland. Alas, they become fast friends while our hero is  investigating a second case. A beautiful, talented teenager went missing 12 years ago and her momma wants to find her. They hunt far and wide, finally turning up a death certificate. The poet has a young wife, an ex-wife and a mother (also a novelist) who all live on his estate in Montana. Some rough stuff happens. Even more drinking and cursing and whoring happens. And we are brought to our, er, conclusion. A happy little book, which, like its hero, succeeds in spite of it not caring what you may think of it.	2005-07-10

Hickum Looney is a lonely salesman who seems to know of nothing but work. He sells soap and other soap-like products for a big company that is micromanaged (absolutely) by a completely deranged, cleft-lipped midget with a nasty violent streak.

Really bad men are working hard on every page to bend the honest world to their greedy, bloodthirsty liking. Sort of a crash course of all things seedy in the sixties and early seventies. Ellroy's distinctive style will probably either make or break the book, depending on your preferences for how you want a story told.

Credit Donna Tartt for supplying enough context and detail that would sink books that committed the cardinal sin of Not Being Thought Out Enough. The languid, unhurried rhythm of \\"The Little Friend\\" is captivating and at times very magical. It won't be the freshest book you read this year, but it finds a literary chord early on, holds it unswervingly and never lets go. I can forgive the minor plot contrivances for the thoroughly authentic sweep of this superbly written off-the-beaten-path mystery.  Much has been said about the ending, with its lack of conventional closure, which surely will not please all readers. It's a good time to remember that some our best writers don't aim for dramatic punch as much as they do for sweet storytelling. I look forward to reading \\"The Secret History,\\" her beloved first book that I have heard so many good things about.	2005-07-02

A thickly philosophical novel that frustrates and challenges one's sense of self and independence. I will not try to add to the canon of literary analysis that has already been heaped upon this famous book, but it is safe to say that it will hit every reader differently. Some will love it for its achingly lonely narrative, and others will withdraw from it for the same reason. I thought that while at times it was ponderous, mostly it endures as a story about universal feelings of isolation and helplessness.	2005-07-02

Catch your breath at the rest stops and rev up again. The only roadbumps to this invigorating read are the raw vernacular and jagged grammar that stab at you like rusty nails for the first 50 pages but become comfortable once you've made the adjustment. <br />Really a tale about class and social justice, Carey's book satisfies because it delivers us to Ned Kelly's 19th century Australia, where corrupt police and earthy settlers fill the stage in this story about a hard, resounding struggle to right a continuum of wrongs.

It is also a fascinating memoir of one of today's most successful crime writers. Although there is an obvious link between these two themes - a link that Ellroy indulges a very large chunk of his book to - the two parts fail to form a complete marriage. For my money the memoir elements of \\"Places\\" are much more compelling and readable. The second half of the book, which documents his work with a retired homicide detective to find the killer, is, well, a little dull. I found myself wishing he would dip back into the well of his youth, when his life was herky-jerky and wild. The investigation into his mother's death is spiked with dead-ends and ponderous soul-searching. And it is dreadfully repetitive at times.	2005-06-27
