But I did try to get through this book with an open mind and must say that about half of the book has some interesting historical events in it. The problem is that most of these events are shaded and slanted in such a way as to make this book useless to anyone who has studied history and historical movements. Eley is a classic radical who really has no appreciation for competing thoughts or ideas other than his leftist view of the world. The fact that the Soviet Union kind of falls off a cliff in the book when its obvious failures killed this evil philosophy and economic system is most telling. But he will continue to write this kind of drivel, pounding nonsense into the kids in his classrooms, and make a lot of money from hard working taxpayers for doing so.	2005-10-08
US	53082166	R2M7UWVO7MO9CN	0520239342	837055044	Muslim Extremism in Egypt: The Prophet and Pharaoh, With a New Preface for 2003	Books	5	2	4	N	Y	A great piece of research	This book was written over 20 years ago, long before anyone focused on the possible consequences of a growing menace to humanity in the guise of Islamic fanatics calling the masses back to the founding tenants of Islam. Kepel lived in Egypt and spent a lot of time researching and reading what was happening in the 70's and 80's as well as examining the causes and consequences of Islamic calls to jihad and having Muslims continue their conquest of the earth in the name of Allah.   This book shows how Egypt's experiment with socialism resulted in a corrupt, dishonest, and totally failed state. Kepel points out the costs of this experiment by showing that the state created a horrific perfect storm, using the establishment of Israel as the ultimate bogeyman to deflect the masses attention away from the failures of socialism. Essentially the Egyptians were no different than the other kleptocracies in the Middle East and held the hand puppet of Israel as the focus of attention while the other hand deprived the general population of any semblance of a decent standard of living. Kepel's insights into the assassination of Sadat because of his overtures to Israel were most enlightening, essentially showing that Sadat was killed by forces he had nourished with years of hatred toward modernity. Carter and his advisors probably still do not understand to this day what damage they did in the Camp David accords when Sadat traded Soviet handouts for American ones. The view held by the vast majority of Muslims in the Middle East of the American-Zionist plot to overtake the Middle East was cemented and fermented in the accord. It took another generation for it to come to fruition in 9/11, but it all started there. Kepel was not aware of Carter's funding of the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan in the 70's at the same time so is not able to link the beginnings of bin Laden's lunatic fringe groups as well. Another interesting observation by Kepel, which is now becoming more apparent is that theIslamic social code of the separation of the sexes lends itself to sexual frustration on the part of the massive numbers of young and horny Muslims so that the lure of 72 virgins may well be the primary recruiting tool for the jihadists to get them to be a \\"martyr\\" by committing suicide and getting the sex they cannot get in their own societies.   Having traveled throughout Egypt many times myself, I can say that the classic \\"jelly bean\\" theory has come to pass. Feed the bear a jelly bean to ward him off will only work as long as you still have jelly beans. When you run out, be prepared to be the next meal of the bear.   A great book, especially given its date of publication. It was far ahead of its time. If only the idiots in the US State Department, CIA, or FBI had read it, the prime instigator of the first attack on the World Trade Center would have been banned from the US instead of being allowed entry after the Egyptians arrested him for his terrorist activities in the 1980's.	2005-10-06

Some of his writting is too cynical, some is just plain wrong, and some so contrdictory as to be silly. His chapter about the Justinian code is ridiculous because the Justinian code is the wave of the future, a code subject to abuse, a threat to the left and right in Europe who model the European Union's proposed constitution after it, etc. I read the chapter twice to see if i missed something or that Cantor must not have read his own material because it was just plain dumb.  <br />There are many books about this subject matter, thousands in fact, but i wouldn't waste my time with this book which is more like a Reader's Digest for Cliff Note readers about Antiquity. I read it because there were so many positive reviews, but the readers who are critical of the book have good reason to call Cantor to task.	2005-09-22

Johnson cited all kinds of statistics to basically call anyone who feared a terrorist attack in the USA a fool. I am sure this was great comfort to the 3,000 people who went to work in the NY World Trade center two months later and had a choice of jumping to their deaths or burning to death before the towers fell on the pulverized remains of the terrorists who had hijacked the aircraft used to kill more American civilians than had ever occurred before in the nation's history.  <br />Now we have a medical doctor, Marc Siegel, telling us the same thing in 200 pages of nonsense.  <br />Siegel does not use the Dr. title, wisely, in giving his advice, since he would probably never be able to practice medicine again once the law suits started after the next terrorist attack, but this is really a very silly book. <br />Siegel is right in his recitation of statistics in reminding us that we have a better chance of being killed in a car crash than a terrorist attack, so far. And he is correct in pointing out the sensationalism rampant in the liberal media when it over hypes stories about SARS, etc. But his political agenda convolutes reasoning in a very dangerous world, where terrorism has replaced historical methods of warfare, just as nitrates replaced bows and arrows as weapons of destruction decades ago.  <br /> <br />Thankfully this book is a one hour read at best, but get your lawyer ready to make you some money after the next terrorist attack and you can convince a jury that you believed this nonsense and didn't fear jihadist lunatics after reading Siegel's shallow and ridiculous book. <br />	2005-09-07

Reading this book should be mandatory at an advanced statistics course of how to come to bad conclusions through the use of selective and wrong data.<br /><br />DC has never had a big industrial base, but it had a very strong and influential black middle class early in the 20th century up until FDR's New Deal when the city was swamped with undereducated and socially dysfunctional immigrants from the southern states. It is the same time that DC became a \\"black majority\\" city. This is the same time frame that Wilson uses to \\"prove\\" that there was a direct correlation with the loss of factory jobs and the explosion of the urban poor. In order to come to this conclusion, Wilson uses a lot of statistics taken out of context, manipulated to support his conclusions, and then come up with a rehash of \\"new\\" policy initiatives which are essentially a regurgitation of LBJ's \\"war on poverty\\" programs, which were an expansion and rehash of FDR's \\"New Deal.\\"<br /><br />What Wilson ignores are demographic shifts and trends that are much more easily explained and much more solidly supported by Charles Murray, Marvin Olasky, and others who were much more thorough in examining the trends that Wilson writes about.<br /><br />The Washington DC area today has more jobs than ever before, yet the illegitimacy rate for black children is 90%. In the 1920's and 30's, the illegitimacy rate for whites and blacks was the same, even during the height of segregation and discrimination. The city now has a population base 25% smaller than its peak in the 50's. Even though job opportunities were expanding for minorities in DC, the black middle class abandoned DC and moved into Prince Georges County to get away from crime and otherdeteriorating social norms, but none of this is to be found in Wilson's research. The same is true for other cities where a combination of \\"white flight\\" and \\"black flight\\" of the middle class made these downtowns more closely resemble cities in third world countries than the USA. Similar problems can be found in Paris and its suburbs, and many other cities around Europe where immigration and a lack of assimilation have created huge ghettos of the \\"Urban Poor.\\" There is indeed a much greater correlation to be found in the expansion of the size of the urban poor with the expansion of government programs designed to eliminate poverty. None of these alternative, and much more persuasive, reasons for the plight of the urban poor are to be found in this book. It was people like Wilson who \\"proved\\" Galileo to be wrong when he said that the Earth revolved around the sun, and this book is about as convincing.<br /><br />There are many good statistics and arguments in this book. The problem is that Wilson has excluded any alternative explanations of the reasons for the urban poor, which makes this a very dishonest book.	2005-08-07

From a historical point of view, it shows us how the NSC was created by Truman, primarily because he was so out of the loop while Vice President that he didn't even know about the Manhattan project to build the atom bomb, but as the book moves into more current events, political slants take over the turn the book into a very one-sided view of the US options available in today's world. Rothkopf is a \\"pragmatist\\" in the Kissinger mold, which I guess he would have to be since he ran Kissinger's shop, but his opinions really show very little depth, and really no historical perspective of options available in dealing with bin Laden and terrorism back when it could have been much more easily dealt with. There are some insights about how Clinton seldom attended NSC meetings when tectonic changes were taking place as he dallied with Monica, but this book isn't really a very sophisticated examination of the world today and how we got here, other than to criticize W Bush for the state of the world today without looking at the limited hand he was dealt by his predecessors when it came to Islamic terrorism. I would have given the book one star but the book's history of the NSC gives it some redeeming social value, but the last half of the book is really pretty worthless because it is so unbalanced and political.	2005-07-24

Like millions of immigrant families, Roberts' family came to the US, set up shop, had kids, worked hard and passed on their genes. For Steve Roberts, his very ordinary and undistinguished career as a writer for The New York Times and other publications was only made significant by his marriage to Cokie Boggs, whose only claim to fame was being the daughter of a big time pol from the south before he died. She then spent a lot of time at ABC as the classic liberal reporter before she got dumped for George Stepyounopulous, Clinton's mouthpiece.  <br />Luckily this book won't take long to read if you want to, but I keep asking myself why I wasted an hour of my life to read it. I guess the high point of the book is that Barney Frank is his good buddy and got him to apply to Harvard. That's about it. Oh, and he was a bag boy for Scotty Reston. Wow. To think some poor tree died for this.	2005-07-09

Stark was one of the many \\"Arabists\\" who traveled the Middle East freely and actually lived in a Baghdad slum for many months just to get closer to the natives. It is more of a travelogue than a political treatise, but her observations and conversations with the old order of the Bedouins and others are interesting. She notes the graveyards of English soldiers who were killed during the days when the newly formed Iraq was a British protectorate after the breakup of the Ottoman Empire after WWI and concludes that these were lives wasted on a very backward country, without understanding the reason this country was important was not for its medievel culture but its oil. Her observations would be considered substantially \\"politically incorrect\\" today, but her access to some of the tribal leaders resulted in very interesting conversations, not the least of which was her meeting with Shaikh 'Abdu'l-Husain and his warnings about the developing events in Palestine, before the creation of Israel, but after the Balfour declaration.   Her description of the intensity of the hatred between the Shiia and the Sunni, the beheading of Ali 1250 years before her visit to Kerbela and Najaf where it is remembered as if it occurred the day before is most insightful. Her declaration of these towns living on their memory of hate where time stopped, is really very good writing. Her observations of the slaves in Kuwait as if it was nothing out of the ordinary, which it wasn't considering the slavery was not officially abolished in Saudi Arabia until the 1960's is also very good history in itself.   Of course such a book could not be written today for many reasons, but if you want to get a better flavor for today's issues in the Middle East, you could do worse than invest a couple hours in this book, since nothing hasreally changed, only the reporting has become remote and detached and politically correct, which gives those of us living today a very unbalanced picture of the forces still at work in Iraq 70 years after she wrote about them.	2005-06-26

The inspiring inscription in the Jefferson Memorial in Washington is just a part of a longer verse that basically showed Jefferson to be the racist that he was who advocated the return of slaves to Africa lest there be a race war since the slaves were mentally incapable of living with the white race. A modern psychologist might consider Jefferson to be schizophrenic in his public proclamations vs. his private life, but Hitchens shows Jefferson to be a classic man of enormous privilege who fathered several children with Sally Hemmings, just like Strom Thurmond did many years later with his lover, while at the same time saying that the introduction of the white gene was the only salvation of the black race.  <br />I can see why this book will go absolutely nowhere, it is just far too honest, and far too well researched to overcome a couple centuries of totally dishonest coverage of the man who beat Robert Byrd to the height of hypocrisy. The great part of this book is that both ends of the political spectrum will gain a lot if they read it with an open mind, but I am sure that the last thing the current \\"leadership\\" of Jefferson's party want is to be exposed as Jefferson's rightful heirs as a hypocrite for the ages. <br />A great book but Hitchens goes too far in placing Jefferson above the many of his contemporaries who contributed far more to the nation.  <br />	2005-06-21

Diamond does a good job of documenting how unprepared our institutions are in dealing with an unprecedented threat to Western civilization, but i think his conclusion that it is a \\"squandered victory\\" is a bit much. While the administration may not have fully understood what they were getting into in Iraq, much of the blame should be placed at the door of State Dept and DOD bureaucracies which have generations of worthless experience in accommodation instead of confrontation of evil. They just are far too set in their ways to understand that this is a different kind of enemy, fighting a different kind of war, and we tie our own hands behind our backs by political correctness disguised as diplomacy.  <br />Ironically, Diamond, who opposed the war from the beginning, and was asked by Condi Rice to go to Iraq for his honest evaluation, is not as pessimistic about the possibilities of the future of democracy in Iraq as the title would suggest, but I suspect if I spent as much time as he did butting his head against entrenched bureaucrats who were confronted with a complete unknown but making bad decisions based on bad information, I'd have a sore head, too. Hopefully someone, somewhere in the government is looking at our successful military experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq and thinking about what will be needed when the rest of the world enters into unknown territory with the fall of the House of Saud, the revolution in Iran, the death of the Stalinist regime in North Korea, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, etc. etc. At the end of WW II, with over 400,000 GI's planted in their graves, we pretty much were cocksure what was needed to get to a peaceful world, until we found it an unexepected and urgent necessity to dedicate a massive amount of our GDP to rescue Europe from starvation and Communist tyranny two years after the death of Hitler. It seems we have learned nothing from that experience, and we don't have any structure of substance to deal with the inevitable when dictatorship ends and democracy sticks its tender head out of the rubble to search for the sun. If you think the State Dept is capable of doing it, I've got a bridge to sell you, which is basically what this book is about. <br />	2005-06-10

Yes, and so does every other global competitor in the world. Are Europeans more productive than Americans? Only if you exclude the statistics that compares apples to apples and doesn't muddy the water with oranges. If you include long term unemployment figures into the European numbers as is done in the US, the real number for unemployment in most of Europe is actually triple the number for the US. Hutton glosses over the unemployment rates in many Muslim ghettoes in France, or the former East German areas which are currently higher than they were during the Great Depression.  <br />Any mention of the cost of the US military commitment to station millions of its military to protect Europe from a Soviet attack? Not really. How about the cost to the US economy to keep Europeans from starving to death after WW I and WW II. Not to be found here. The billions spent by the US to rebuild the European economies so that they could compete with the US? Nah. The billions of dollars spent in humanitarian aid all over the world? Zilch. And of course this was written long before the Tsunami in 2004, where US aid was in place within days, saving millions of lives, and six months after the disaster hit, most of the European assistance, as pitiful as it turned out to be vs. the announced commitments, is still sitting on the docks rotting in the heat.  <br />I could go on, but it wouldn't do any good to try to deal with the hundreds of totally disingenuous assertions in this book. <br />But at least Hutton is consistent in all of his books. Consistently dishonest and profoundly uninformed.  <br />	2005-05-29

Kagan has done a masterful job of cutting to the chase in explaining the reasons why most Americans left the fetid monarchies of \\"old Europe\\" to make a life for themselves instead of relying on their corrupt and morally bankrupt masters who control the levers of power. (Ironically, for the same  reasons millions of Mexicans seek refuge in the USA to escape their hell of the modern day equivalent of \\"old Europe\\" known as Mexico today.)   <br />The Europeans have a very short memory span, and an even shorter view of history, which is why an intellectual politician such as Tony Blair can connect the dots between Chamberlain and Chirac, Hitler and Hussein, and have more in common with Thatcher and Churchill than the leftists in his party who think there is no connection between the murders of millions at the hands of a monster like the communist Stalin and the murders of millions by socialists like Saddam.  <br />If you like this book, I suggest you read Weigel's \\"Cube and the  Cathedral\\" to better understand the religious underpinnings of why Europe was so unique in its transformation from uncivilized savagery, to the enlightenment, to uncivilized savagery, and now total impotence in the face of the newest form of Fascism. <br />	2005-05-17

She was the first woman Secretary of State and probably one of the worst Secretaries of any department in any era. Admittedly she worked for a morally bankrupt man who governed based upon what the polling data showed, but this book reveals that the ship of State was rudderless and without a compass.  <br />If the titles \\"Clueless\\" and \\"Sleepwalking through History\\" weren't already taken, they would have been much more apt descriptions of Albright's tenure in such serious posts as Secretary of State or Ambassador to the UN. <br />The initial chapters were interesting in her personal history as her family moved from Czechoslovakia and to the USA, but it was all downhill after that.  <br />I kept turning hundreds of pages looking for some substance or recognition of her true impact on world events but couldn't find any. Her refusal to be \\"baited\\" at the UN and defending the USA by rabid haters of the USA and instead making jokes about how it made her feel \\"young again\\" was telling. She glosses over the North Korean violation of the \\"framework\\" negotiated between the new Clinton Administration in 1993 and 1994 by the peanut farmer and never acknowledges that this \\"framework\\" was violated by the North Koreans from day one, but somehow blames the Bush Administration for calling an end to this charade by revealing the fact that the North Koreans never lived up to their commitments. The bombings by al Qaeda of the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania the year that Osama declared war on Western Civilization? No connection that she had anything to do with it or the impact of the US tepid response. What about Clinton hiding behind her skirt and sending her out to defend him when he lied to her and the nation about Monica? It was all Ken Starr's fault. Arafat lying through his teeth about Palestinian terrorism and using the White House as his platform? Not a problem. Rwanda and the greatest genocide in modern history since Pol Pot as hundreds of thousands of Tutsi's were hacked to death? Boys will be boys, and besides, the UN didn't want to get involved. Any thought about how Saddam built billions of dollars of palaces under the Oil for Food program that she supported? An audit program? What and upset the French who were collecting the billions involved in the program thru Paris banks?. Mon Dieu!!  <br />This book is much more spin than substance, but I actually think that she doesn't recognize the difference. If you want to know why we were so highly thought of by the enemies of freedom, you can read all about it here. We were very, very nice when we should have been very, very determined. If you want to know just how the world became such a dangerous place on her watch, you might be better off saving the dollar I paid for this book and asking some wino on a park bench. Most have them have a better understanding of the real world. The Freudian analysis of this book's title is that she may have been the biggest Madam in Foggy Bottom while she was in charge of the house located there called the State Department. The problem is that she is probably unaware of the fact that it may not necessarily be a compliment.  <br />	2005-05-17

The only thing they have in common is that they are probably all more messed up than they need have been because of bureaucrats like him. He now has the chutzpah to declare the building of a new Iraq as a \\"fiasco\\", without ever having stepped into the parts of the country that he criticizes the most. <br />Like many of those who park themselves in places like the Council on Foreign Relations, that bastion of effectiveness in world diplomatic efforts, he is great to criticize those who actually make difficult decisions instead of standing around wringing their hands for decades.  <br />The good news about this book is that he is such an ineffective and discredited advocate for his position that after the first twenty pages you realize that this is Richard Clarke light, publishing in a non-election year, so that he exposes himself to be just another locker-room expert who never understood the game but loved to sniff the air of the real players. Thank goodness it was a slow day at Borders today and it only took two cups of coffee to read this temper tantrum. Since he speaks fluent French, he might want to have this translated before the real value of the book reaches the level it deserves, somewhere around 3 cents. <br />Yes there are obvious problems associated with building democracy in countries that have never known it, but with \\"advisors\\" like Phillips, they would never get off the ground to begin the process. I am sure he has many sympathizers with his position within the State Department, which is why it has served this country so poorly for decades. But at least he is on the outside looking in now, which I suspect is the only reason this little piece of venom was published, especially since his published works calling for the end of Saddam's WMD programs don'tlook too good on his CV.  <br />	2005-05-16

I read this book many years ago before Amazon existed, but read it again after reading many far superior books on the subject, especially Rubenstein's \\"Genocide.\\"  <br />Was the Nazi program to exterminate the Jews evil. Yes of course, but the same documents that deal with Jewish extermination also include pre-existing orders to exterminate the Gypsies and Poles. Of the six million Poles killed by the Nazis, less than half were Jewish.  More Polish Catholics were killed by Hitler than were Polish Jews killed in the gas chambers. The original Blitzkrieg in 1939 was carried out under Hitler's orders issued on August 22 of that year to authorize the killing \\"without pity or mercy all men, women, and children of Polish descent or language. Only in this way can we achieve the living space we need.\\" His order was NOT limited to Polish Jews, and Poland lost over 20% of its population, a far greater ratio of deaths than any other country in WW II. While the Nazi's initially focused on Polish leaders; Catholic clergy, intelligentsia, politicians, military commanders and such, the entire population was targeted for extermination once the slaves had served their purpose in supporting the war machine. Just as the French, I suspect.  <br /> <br />Katz also ignores the effect of the determination by the Nazi's to allow \\"mixed blood\\" Jews in the \\"Aryan Race\\" to live.  <br />Katz has allowed himself to be blinded by his thesis that the Jews were the only ones who were singled out for extermination by a madman and his regime. This is simply not true. While we have a multimillion dollar museum in Washington, and Berlin has now a new monument to remember the Holocaust, Katz cheapens the vile nature of Nazi Germany by claiming it as something which singled out the Jews. While we should \\"Never forget,\\" we should also learn and remember that the Jews were not the only victims of the \\"Master Race.\\"  <br />And I won't even get into the much more balanced discussion of the other Holocausts in the last century in Rubenstein's book, including the one that Hitler cited as the role model for his when he asked the question of \\"Who remembers the Armenians?\\" when they lost a greater percentage of their population at the hands of the Turks at the end of the Ottoman Empire. <br />This is a good book that covers a lot of facts, but it is unfortunate that Katz desire to put Jews into an \\"uber\\" category of victimhood makes this a work not worthy of the price. <br />	2005-05-15

The amazing thing about this book is that it is far more honest that the movie, but it also was almost universally condemned when it was published for its brutal honesty in exposing modern day Africa. Richburg was brutalized for being thankful that his ancestors survived the crossing of the Atlantic and were delivered into slavery in the US. The reason he was thankful was that he was following in the footsteps of millions of descendents of millions of others who voluntarily left their native countries to seek a better life in the USA. His critics focused on the fact that many of Richburg's ancestors fellow slaves did not make the transit, but they also never admitted that the brutality of the continent, including the fact that Richburg's relatives were sold by black slave traders to black or Arab or white slave traders is never mentioned in the literature about slavery. Richburg is to be commended for his honest reaction to the cesspool that is Africa today, far worse a place to live than the continent when European colonists tried to introduce codes of conduct to replace those of the Hutu or Tutsi, where hundreds of thousands were slaughtered because of racial characteristics just as superficial as skin color. Richburg is to be commended for his honest reaction to the reality of Africa as it is today. It is unfortunate that his critics have never been exposed to the actuality that was his life while he was African bureau chief for the Washington Post. It is a book far too honest to ever be turned into a movie by Hollywood since it would require them to admit how out of touch with the truth they are.	2005-05-13

He did it as a graduate of West Point, and I did it as a graduate of the rice paddies. The lessons he learned were far different from mine, but I suspect that most of his \\"education\\" came from moving to Boston rather than understanding the world he writes about. Like the many officers from West Point I served under, Bacovich has zero, and I mean ZERO, understanding of humanity. He reminds me of a classmate at the London School of Economics when I was getting my doctorate, who was given a standing ovation about his thesis that the victory of communism over capitalism was inevitable, and then ran out to join the protesters denouncing Reagan's deployment of the Pershing II's. I think he really enjoys his job at Oxford, even though he is totally clueless about the real world and spews his nonsense to innocent young minds who have no alternative at the school to counteract this idiocy.     Bacovich is typical in his recitation of statistics about the US investment in peace surpassing that of the Europeans who grew to rely on \\"Uncle Sam\\" as their protector instead of helping themselves. This book is actually beyond dumb; it is a Potemkin panorama of \\"facts\\" that do not stand up in the light of day. His chapter on how the draft was better than the current volunteer military?? I don't think so, even if it included the \\"volunteers\\" that I served with like Al Gore, Jr. son of the most racist Senator besides Bobby Byrd serving at the time. (OK Fulbright, as the draft-dodging Clinton's mentor was there, too, but what the hay) Bacevich is from the Colin Powell branch of the military, the same ones who stuck with horses after WWI to defend the country while Hitler was building his Panzers.   Americans are not \\"seduced\\" by war. We walk among the hundreds of thousands of graves of brave American men at dozens of cemeteries around the globe and remember how people like Bacevich promised \\"peace in our time\\", just before the bloodletting began that resulted in the deaths of scores of millions of humans.   This book is interesting for those whose understanding of history is warped by the leftists who rule academia today, but if you have the slightest understanding of the relationship of might vs. right, this book is a total waste of money. It is the no different than spitting on the graves of those who served their country and stabbing them in the back when they returned, like Bacevich's hero, Mamma T's husband.	2005-04-19
US	53082166	R3TSL6P7VOUSYI	0521812879	478601681	Buried by the Times: The Holocaust and America's Most Important Newspaper	Books	4	50	61	N	N	Good research but....	This is a very good book about how the New York Times family owners purposefully avoided dealing with the issue of anti-Semitism in Europe, and particularly Nazi Germany, while at the same time the Sulzberger family did everything it could to get its relatives out before the deluge. Laurel Leff has done a masterful job of showing how the Sulzberger clan became complicit in one of the darkest chapters in human history by not using the power of the paper to expose the real nature of the evil that Nazism was. Of course she does address the fact that anti-Semitism was not just a German issue, but from my perspective she does not go into enough detail about the extent of anti-Semitism in the US, and particularly major movers and shakers such as Joseph Kennedy who hated Jews so much that he always referred to them as \\"kikes\\" and opposed any action by the Roosevelt administration to educate the American public about the threat to Western civilization, even though he was ambassador to the Court of St. James at the time.  <br />But the problem with this book is that it focuses on the Times as if it somehow committed this sin for the first time in misleading the American public. I agree with her thesis that the Times has been hoisted as the most influential paper in the world among lazy elites, including those who have reviewed her book, but that is rapidly changing now, primarily due to the fact that the paper has failed so miserably in many areas, including the latest diversions of small change like Jason Blair. But the biggest holocaust of the last century did not occur in the ovens built by the Nazis, it was committed in the Ukraine when Stalin's forced collectivization starved far more Ukrainians to death than Hitler killed with his Zyklon-B. And the Times had a reporter, Walter Duranty, in Moscow at the time who won a Pulitzer Prize for mis-reporting this horror. Duranty was \\"Stalin's apologist\\" in many ways, dismissing honest reporters who covered the biggest holocaustas \\"overwrought\\"  when they filed stories about the millions murdered by Stalin, filing stories about the \\"show trials\\" of Stalin as if they were legitimate trials that led to the deaths of millions more, and many other atrocities. Most serious scholars now have to acknowledge that the starvation of 8 million Ukrainians was not just an \\"unintentional consequence\\" of collectivization, and it really remains the NY Times most outrageous attack on the truth, the Nazi death camps notwithstanding. There are many stories in the NY Times that  reveal the lie that is it's masthead of \\"All the news that's fit to print.\\" The Times fought mightily to keep Duranty's  prize last year when serious reporters wanted to take it away because it was gained by fraudulent means. Of course the paper has done a great job of condemning the awarding of Olympic medals by drug-enhanced athletes, but can't see the hypocrisy of its own efforts to keep Duranty's decades of duplicity being rewarded with a Pulitzer. <br />I recommend this book because it shows the hypocrisy of the Sulzberger clan in dealing with Hitler's \\"final solution\\" but it is not the biggest sin committed by this paper in miseducating the people it supposedly serves. <br />	2005-04-05

This book is probably the best example of elitist arrogance whining about how they can't deal with judicial law-making when it goes against their view of the world. \\"The common law\\" as leftist elitists like Feinman define it is the law written by fellow judicial activists who write laws that would never pass muster by a majority of the people, or their elected representatives. They invent unwritten rights with their decisions, and transform American society into something that could never happen if it weren't for activists like Feinman and his leftist ilk. Now that the conservatives are doing exactly what Feinman's fellow travelers have done over the last few generations, it is somehow \\"rolling back\\" the \\"Common Law\\". <br />this book is a great instruction on how the judiciary has become the nightmare of some of our founding fathers who worried that this \\"least important\\" of the three branches of government has arrogated to itself powers never envisioned by them.

If your view of the \\"new world\\" before its discovery by Europeans in the 1400's is one of natives living in elysian fields, plucking daisies, peeling grapes for each other and reciting poetry to an educated civilization, you will probably like this book. If you are well read and understand that the advance of civilization over the millennia all over the globe has been mixed at best, you will laugh at most of the \\"findings\\" of this book. Stannard dismisses the savage nature of the tribal bands that populated the Northern and Southern continents, yet find no problem in savaging fairness and perspective in his romp through his selective rendition of history.<br /><br />While Stannard has made a career of condemning European settlement of the Americas (yes, named after Americus Vespucci the European) he totally ignores or dismisses the dark side of the cultures that the Europeans found. One example is the Aztecs.  The Aztecs built their capital city, called Tenochtitlan, in the center of enormous Lake Texcoco. (The site of modern day Mexico City, from which millions flee every year to go to the USA to live a better life.) The Aztecs believed they were the \\"chosen people\\" of Huitzilopochtli, not unlike the Jews of the \\"old world\\". But in the 1300's the Jews were not sacrificing humans and had \\"graduated\\" to goats, unlike the Aztecs. It is why Cortez was able to rely on a welcoming population of natives who for some reason or another, didn't appreciate the fact that their sons and daughters were sliced open, their beating hearts removed and offered as sacrifice to the Aztec gods on the Coyolxauhqui Stone.  The stone is over ten feet in diameter and is the carved relief of a dismembered female.  It is believed that this dismembered female is the Goddess Coyolxauhqui.  The stone was formerly located at the base of the stairway at Templo Mayor.  Its original purpose was to stop the bodies that were rolled off the sacrificial area atop Templo Mayor after their beating hearts had been removed from their chests. . While there are no official records, the number of human sacrifices in this river of human blood is believed to be in the hundreds of thousands. Remember that this is contemporaneous with the \\"dark ages\\" in Europe, which did a few executions of its own with its \\"auto-de-fe\\" of a couple dozen \\"heretics\\".<br /><br />Stannard's other attacks on the development of North and South America are similarly unbalanced and unhinged. He totally ignores the findings of anthropologists and archeologists who have found substantial examples of cannibalism amongst the many tribes inhabiting the Americas during the movements all over the globe in the last several centuries. Slavery was a world-wide universal cultural norm that had existed since we climbed out of the trees. Was it bad? You betcha. But it didn't end until the Europeans said it didn't conform to advancing notions of freedom and individual liberty. Saudi Arabia finally officially ended slavery in its kingdom in 1963. But it still exists in the Sudan, and many other places today.<br /><br />This is not to say that humans cannot revert to form. Just ask any survivor of the death camps in Poland, or a Tutsi who escaped a machete wielding Hutu mob, the survivors of the Balkan, Armenian, Cambodian, etc. genocides and they will all tell you that \\"mankind\\" is less than kind.<br /><br />Stannard and his ilk really do not get it, and they enjoy the freedom to spread their nonsense while condemning the society that allows them a very good living at taxpayer expense.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book worth reading about this topic, I suggest you find something that was written by a real scholar, and not this nonsense.ase of the stairway at Templo Mayor.

Kennedy	Books	1	10	32	N	N	White wash of a dark family	I suppose if you have not read any legitimate studies about the Kennedy's you might find this book interesting, but it really is a very selective and misleading account of a family that has had a major impact on the USA. While it is good to see these letters published, I suspect that there are hundreds more which will never see the light of day since they would paint a much more balanced picture of this family. Joseph P. Kennedy was a very rich, very influential pol in Democrat Party politics. He was also someone who got in bed with the Mafia, which probably led to the death of JFK, got into bed with numerous Hollywood sluts, which gave his sons their lack of a moral compass, was a physical coward when it came to dealing with Fascism, and a bigot who didn't really have a problem with Hitler's \\"final solution\\" in getting rid of the Jews he hated from the core of his being. But he did a good job of using his millions to steal the 1960 election through voter fraud to get his son elected. I suspect that he never gave a thought to whether it was all worth it while seeing his sons buried. The most interesting thing about these letters however is that his remaining spawn, Teddy, is really the apple of his father's eye. A total pol, with zero understanding of the need for some view of the future through something other than a politician's lens, JPK Sr. was a great teacher for Teddy's willingness to turn a blind eye to evil and run for cover when the going got tough. A revealing book when you consider that the editing done was to put this family in the best light. But at least it is a start, and future revelations will show this book to be the unbalanced white-wash that it is.	2005-03-13

There are a couple decent sections written by some fairly good academics, but some of them, especially the chapter written by Barbara Green, are just plain ridiculous in their analysis and conclusions. Her conclusion that Stalin's murder of millions of Ukrainians was not \\"genocide\\" is just silly. Not only that, her reading list is very incomplete in that it did not include eye witness accounts of how systematic the death sentence of starvation was actually carried out. The chapter by Stannard which compares the settlement of the USA over several centuries in an era long gone with Hitler's attempted extermination of the Jews and Gypsies is ludicrous. While he may make some interesting arguments, he ignores the reality of the cultures existing in the \\"New World\\" where human sacrifice was rampant, slavery and war-making were the norm, long before the Europeans showed up. Not a word about that in his analysis. He also equates the massive deaths of Indians by infectious diseases brought to the new world with the deaths in the Nazi concentration camps, which would mean that the AIDS epidemic which started in Africa makes all Africans the biggest perpetrators of genocidal death in the history of mankind according to his logic.<br /><br />While this book is one of hundreds on the topic, it is not one that is worth the investment of time or money if you are interested in the subject.	2005-03-11

Ever since Frank Church brought out the knife and did the deed, our intelligence community has had zero ability to do what any intelligence community needs to do, which is to kill them before they kill us. Our courts have aided and abetted this travesty, and there has been no administration with the possible exception of Casey working for Reagan that has understood that the bad guys use our rules and idiot judges to hamstring any effort to keep us safe. This book is an even bigger failure than our intelligence community in addressing the real problems we face today. It will take a nuclear blast or bio attack that kills millions before our PC Congress gets it right. This book does nothing to help us, and actually makes our situation worse by attacking a President who understands that Washington bureaucrats are the biggest obstacle to keeping us safe from Islamofasicists. I wrote my intitial review of this book before the latest Presidential Commission wrote an even more scathing indictment of how our intelligence community is as efficient as the Post Office, as intense as the Agriculture Department, and as effective as a single piece of toilet paper in protecting you from getting wet in a hurricane.

This book is not that journey; it is a complete work of fiction. The Meeropol boys (the name given to them with their adoption by leftist activists) Robert and Michael, plus others in the family such as their offspring Ivy and Rachel, have all become prominent leftists, continuing their attacks on capitalism and the United States. The problem that Robert has in writing this book is that even the Soviet Union has seen the light and disappeared, but in so doing, it opened up its vaults and revealed their ugly contents. Those contents were also verified by the release of the Venona Project papers a few years ago, which proved beyond any reasonable doubt that the Rosenbergs were traitors to the United States. I would feel sorry for the Meeropols, except that they have decided to continue in the path of their parents, supporting extremist left-wing organizations, attacking their country at every turn, and otherwise proving that apples, especially bad ones, don't fall very far from the tree. It is unfortunate that they have decided to live a life of denial instead of reflection on what motivated their parents to support this nation's enemies. Perhaps they would have taken different journeys themselves. It is ironic that the Meeropol clan now writes books, engages in leftist workshops, and work for organizations that undermine the liberties that they take for granted, just like their parents did. One of the saddest sections deals with Meeropol's attacks on the prosecutors of his parents' crimes, in effect blaming them for his parents preference to go to the chair, leaving him an orphan, rather than reveal the names of their fellow collaborators. Their love for communism obviously greater than their love for their sons.  <br /> <br />The errors and omissions in this book are so numerous and outrageous that it would take a book twice the length of this one to detail them all. Suffice it to say that if you are looking for anything that resembles the truth regarding what despicable scum the Rosenberg traitors really were, you won't find it in here. But thankfully there are several books which are available now to expose this piece of fiction for what it is.  <br />	2005-03-05

The old adage of \\"The only thing necessary for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing\\" is the ultimate lesson of this book. There are numerous examples of how the French really aided and abetted the Nazis, with a political landscape of real chaos and a kind of moral relativism which has only gotten worse since WWII. While there were a few courageous members of the resistance who were very active at the beginning of the war, the movement really did not take off until it was obvious that the Nazis were going to lose. But the Vichy army killed thousands of Allied troops who were fighting the Nazis in the French colonies, and they were not forced to do so under the gun. The silly references by the French to their support of the US revolution ignores other more important and recent attacks on the US by their installation of Maximillian in Mexico, their duplicity during the Cold War, their bribery by Saddam, and many other stabs in the back. Their opportunistic support two hundred years ago is really irrelevant to today's world. <br />For anyone suffering the delusions that the French are a friend of the US, this book will go a long way to setting the record straight. <br /> <br />	2005-02-10

Unknown in the US is any coverage of what the rest of the world classifies as the \\"Jewish conspiracy\\" of media dominance in the US. It appears daily in the major media in the Islamic world as the reason for US support of Israel and the reason for jihad against the infidels. It also explains much of French, German and British hatred of the US, long before GW Bush showed up. This book covers some of this, but not much, and is one of the reasons it does not get more stars. But the book has some great insights such as the following.<br /><br />Did you know that Punch Sulzberger viewed the current publisher, his son \\"Pinch\\" Sulzberger's positions on the Vietnam War to be treasonous because his son said he would cheer on the death of an American soldier over a Viet Cong in Vietnam in a face to face fight? Do you know that the majority of the editorial positions at the Times are held by militant homosexuals, and that one of the editorial writers at the Times is married to a member of the Massachusetts Supreme court who cast the deciding vote on the issue of legalizing gay marriage in that state but never revealed his affiliation in his many columns on the issue? (The Times' own ombudsman, Daniel Okrent, recently said that the Times' coverage of homosexual issues has crossed the line from reportage to advocacy.) Do you know that the Times is a \\"publicly held\\" company, but the family has prevented any kind of modern corporate governance with its stranglehold on its preferred stock while at the same time the paper screams about corporate transparency at every other corporation in the US? And that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to \\"The Trust\\" that guarantees the succession of the male heir to the throne. A corrupt American version of British primogeniture in kingly succession to the Time's monarchy.<br /><br />But this book also shows why the Times has become a shadow of its former self, is beset by scandal after scandal such as the Jason Blair forgeries (which occurred after the publication of this book) and has resulted in the gradual decline of a formerly great paper. While newspapers are probably doomed in this century, just as the town criers before them, as they are replaced by the internet and cable television news, you can find out why The New York Times is in its death spiral by reading this book. Unfortunately the authors were reluctant to get into the business consequences of the loss of credibility of publications such as the Times with mainstream Americans, but this is still a very worthwhile book. Unfortunately the billions of dollars sucked out of the unsuspecting shareholder of the Times never gets to read about the corruption and moral bankruptcy of current Times management, but this book would be a good place to start.	2005-01-01

This is not a book about \\"George W. Bush's America\\" as its title claims. It is about Ms. Ivins distorted view about the record of G. W. Bush. There are far too many factual errors, and outright misrepresentations to list them. But one example is the education issue. Numerous studies have shown that the \\"No child left behind\\" act has resulted in dramatic improvement in test scores for underprivileged children where school systems have had to change focus on education instead of the school lobby. Ms Ivins' references to this change refer only to discredited \\"studies\\" by special interest organizations whose methodology has been discredited.   This is a very mendacious book. The good part of this book is that it is one of those reinforcement exercises for delusional liberals. They will read this, support Howard Dean, and lose the next election. Molly is a gift that keeps on giving.	2004-12-30

Now that Strom is dead, the only remaining KKK member in the US Senate is Robert Byrd. A racist for all of his life, who occasionally slips up and uses his favorite terms for African Americans, as he did last year, he now shares with us his observations about George Bush. If you have ever talked to this man, or even worse, seen him in action on the Senate floor, you can only pray that Afghans or Iraqis don't watch him since they'd welcome dictatorship back in a second.  <br />This book is so silly that it should come with crayons to keep his admirers occupied. But as the saying goes, there is no fool like an old fool, and Grand Kleagle Bobby fits the bill with this book. I don't think there is a single chapter in this book that rises above the level of a 6th grader, but i'm sure he made a bundle in writing this nonesense, as he has done his entire career.	2004-12-27

The authors should do the honorable thing and use their sword on themselves to show us how Hara Kiri really works. Of course a bamboo sword, which is not very sharp, would be the honorable way out. <br />	2004-12-17

The sad fact is that Japanese school children have never been taught the true nature of the brutality of the Japanese military, and we now have several new generations who live in ignorance of the truth about Japanese militarism in the first half of the Twentieth Century.  <br />The authors of this book are no different than other propagandists who deny the numerous other holocausts in the last century of the Armenians, the Ukrainians, the Jews, and the horrible atrocities the Japanese inflicted on the Chinese, the Koreans, and anyone that the Japanese army fought such as the Americans, the British, and other native populations in SE Asia.  <br />Having spent more time in Japan than I care to admit, this book is actually a reflection of the knowledge of the majority of the Japanese population about their crimes against humanity during the 30's and 40's,  with the exception of those scum of the war who actually committed millions of atrocities and know better, but are too cowardly to come forward and expose books like this to be the lie that they are. At least they are consistent in their shameful approach to life. This is a society in denial of its crimes against humanity, using humans as guinea pigs for the \\"experiments\\" as well as their brutality against civilians. Even the German Siemens representative, John Rabe in his diaries, who has been called the Oskar Schindler of China, wrote a first hand account of these atrocities, but the authors of this book ignore the truth. And of course the Japanese critics of his book, \\"The Good Man of Nanking\\" are the same ones who favorably review this piece of trash. <br />The authors of this book should be ashamed, but they are able to write this nonsense because there was no Nuremberg equivalent after the war ended because McArthur kept the military industrial infrastructure intact out of the fear of communist pressures. It would have been like keeping a murderer like Saddam in power to keep the Shiia out of power. <br />Luckily this fable is very short and can be read in less than a couple hours so only one anti-vomit pill is needed to get through it. The positive reviewers of this book are the same kind of gullible apologists who have no understanding of putting propaganda like this in proper perspective. The spawn of Neville Chamberlain. Just how many pictures do you need of atrocities to understand that this book is pure fiction.?  You won't see those pictures in this book, but anyone who has any sense of history can view them. This book is the OJ defense on a grand scale. <br />This book makes \\"Mein Kampf\\" look like an honest discussion of the issues facing Europe after WWI. This is a book written by citizens of a country which should hold its head in shame for centuries to attempt to atone for the sins of their fathers. The sad fact is they are ignorant of them. I read this book and wrote this review on the anniversary of another cowardly attack, on Pearl Harbor, and held off submitting it to see if I had cooled off after reading this book. Sorry, but I only got madder. <br /> <br />	2004-12-08

While it may be a \\"new world sport\\" for Gibson, it is really a rehash of an old world sport for many. A great example of this is Jean Francois Revel's best seller called \\"Anti-Americanism\\" which came out a few years ago that shows just how stupid most of the critics of the USA are. Their parents applauded Chamberlain in 1938 for delivering \\"peace in our time,\\" and after 50 million dead, we finally got peace. For a couple years. <br />Gibson is to be commended for his book, but he would do well to interview someone like Revell who got there a couple decades ago in explaining the cultural bankruptcy of his fellow Frenchmen, as well as the leftists who infect higher education all over the Western world. <br /> <br />	2004-11-22

If you are looking for an objective examination of the New Deal and the events leading up to WW II, or an explanation of why FDR was surrounded by so many communists, this is not the book for you. There are other books suggested as alternatives that would be a much better source of information instead of this propaganda. Goodwin admits to being a liberal, and this book shows that on every page. She cannot even bring herself to discuss Eleanor's lesbian relationships in a candid and honest way. The only new revelation I found in the book was the fact that some newspaper reporters who wrote about the administration actually LIVED in the White House while spewing their propaganda in the name of objective journalism.  If you want to read a book that reinforces your belief that FDR was nearly a flawless human, then read this book. If you want to read some actual history, such as FDR's 1940 campaign where he branded anyone who said he was planning on taking the US into the war in Europe as a liar, while planning at the same time to do so, and doing so with his embargo of oil to Japan that guaranteed the attack on the US, there are many better books than this. Goodwin is an admitted plagarist, and she would have been better off stealing some legitimate material for this book than publishing this tripe.	2004-11-12

Few of the battles take more than a few pages. It covers, as the title says, seiges from Jerico to Sarajevo. While there are some of the more savage ones missing, such as when a Mongol army commanded by Tolui, son of Genghis Khan, besieged Merv in February 1221. Its peaceful surrender was followed by the the beheading of hundreds of thousands of residents, according to most Islamic historians, with each of the Khan's soldiers obligated to chop off the heads of at least 300 men, women, and children. Some put the death toll over 500,000.   But this is still a very interesting book and well worth having on any shelf as a quick reference of history-changing battles. Each battle analysis includes the long or short term impact of the event.	2004-11-05

The voting system in the country is very broken, and getting worse every day as the rhetoric escalates and the cheaters game the system. While there have been stolen elections many times in the USA, the only recent one at the national level was JFK's election in 1960 by dead people in Chicago and ghosts in Texas. Of course you could say the Democrats are up to the same old tricks with a different twist since they did a good job of disenfranchising black voters in the South with Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, and KKK intimidation back when Senator Byrd was still wearing his white dress and hood in the 'hood. The claims by Democrats of election fraud in Florida in 2000 were proven to be false by every reputable organization that looked into it, including some very liberal newspapers who spent a lot of time doing recounts. But John Fund's little book shows numerous examples of voter fraud on a grand scale, in mostly Democratic areas, and this election will make 1960 look like petty theft. With more registered voters in some areas than there are living adults, where 40,000 New York voters from heavily Democrat districts are also registered to vote in Florida and thousands of them apparently did vote for Gore twice in 2000, and where the system is rigged to reward fraud, our election system is headed towards anarchy, if it isn't already there. With the race card played by Democrats at any attempt by Republicans to make this an honest process, we could well wind up with a president who was elected by fraud instead of by the will of the people. This is the only nation where cashing a check requires more identification than casting a vote. It is a sad day when the American soldiers who liberated Afghanistan and Iraq may well have their vote stolen while overseeing a more honest election process in those countries so new to freedom.	2004-10-19
US	53082166	R38P69VRTYKM1L	0393304167	967021122	Execution by Hunger: The Hidden Holocaust	Books	5	59	68	N	Y	the holocaust that Hollywood will never acknowledge	When Hitler was asked about the possible negative consequences of the \\"final solution\\" in gassing all the remaining Jews in the world, he is reported to have responded by asking the question of \\"Who remembers the Armenians\\" who were killed by the \\"young Turks\\" at the end of the Ottoman Empire. While the numbers are in dispute, the reality is that over a million were killed outright or died of hunger during the campaign to exterminate the Armenians. But the real hidden holocaust took place over a decade later, when the Communist jackals running the \\"Evil Empire\\" in Moscow set about to eliminate the Ukrainians by systematic starvation, in far greater numbers than Hitler was able to accomplish with his ovens in concentration camps all over Europe.  <br />Whoever Miron Dolot is, since he wrote this under a pseudonym for some reason, he lived a horror for many years that is incomprehensible for normal human beings. His description of the  day-to-day struggle to exist under a system so evil that it boggles the imagination was very eloquent. Dolot talks about the neighbors who starved to death, families who engaged in cannibalism in order to survive, mothers committing suicide after the last of their children had died from malnutrition, frozen bodies stacked like firewood, roads littered with the remains of those who died trying to find a kernel of corn to ingest, and many other horrors that bring tears to your eyes. The Soviets did everything they could do to kill their opposition, including killing dogs and cats to keep them from becoming the last remaining food source for farmers who had no other option to stay alive. Even birds were shot from the trees to keep them from the starving peasants. But it was not limited to the Ukrainians; just ask the relatives of the millions of Chechens, Ingushetian's, and others who wanted independence and were rewarded with death in Soviet concentration camps called Gulags. Most of this story deals with a small Ukrainian village, but itis a microcosm of what happened in the Communist utopia under Stalin. Some of the stories from those who returned to the village after the horrors of being transported in cattle cars and escaped from the gulags are no different than the pictures of the same form of transport shown in many Holocaust movies.  <br />But this story is far better than many of the holocaust films we have seen from Hollywood that concentrated on the one committed by Hitler. And why have we not seen this book on film to put all of the holocausts committed in the last century in context? Maybe it has something to do with the fact that McCarthyism still exists in its original form, when the communists controlled Hollywood in the 30's and apologists like Walter Duranty of the New York Times, who carries the label of \\"Stalin's Apologist\\" won a Pulitzer prize for his misreporting from Moscow about how great Stalin was.  Ken Billingsley and his masterful book \\"Hollywood Party\\" shows that the real \\"blacklist\\" existed when loyal Americans veered from Moscow's party line, and explains Ronald Reagan's contempt for the communists who controlled his union until he won election to rid the union of these lice. <br />This is a great book. Hopefully someone like Mel Gibson will convert this to film for those who do not read, but are mislead by the Hollywood elite who condemn the USA and would have lasted two minutes under the Stalinist regime they glorify. <br />	2004-10-19
US	53082166	RYPZXJMLV0LLK	0670033413	346964267	Windblown World: The Journals of Jack Kerouac 1947-1954	Books	2	32	49	N	N	Another Brinkley sell out	Growing up as a \\"boomer\\" in the 50's and 60's as I did was as transforming an event as the transition from the 20's to the 30's for many, and Kerouac was one of those whose writings captured that transformation for me and millions of others with his \\"On the Road\\" best seller in 1957. He had his detractors like Capote who sniffed at him as just being \\"a typist\\" but millions loved his break from the suburban swamps and into the \\"beat\\" generation which he had named, doing drugs, experimenting with all kinds of sex, and just adding to the general adolescent rebellion that took form in the 60's in many ways. This book, in Kerouac's letters and other writings from his other friends, shows him to be a much different kind of person. A serious student of other writers in serious times, he was much more complex than \\"sex, drugs, and rock and roll\\". <br />He was almost completely paralyzed by self-doubt for most of his life, and his alcoholism obviously took a toll on his brain before it killed him at 47. This book in the form of Kerouac's writings is most revealing. The problem with this book is its author/editor, Brinkley. Brinkley leaves out any mention of the journal Kerouac completed which is at the U of Texas in Austin, or his tangle with the law with Ginsberg, and many other misquotes and factual errors. But what this book reveals most about Brinkley is that he is really not the historian he holds himself out to be; he is just another hired gun, willing to write incomplete and misleading hagiographies for the right price, as he did for John Kerry or Jimmy Carter, among others.  <br />Hopefully someday the Kerouac estate will allow a real historian access to the material they have and not leave it to someone who is willing to shave the facts here and there to make a work of fiction instead of a real story about a real man.  <br />	2004-10-19

If you have ever been to a campus where Horowitz is speaking, you get to see what Nazi Germany must have been like; only the new \\"Brown Shirts\\" are the students and faculty who live in a taxpayer supported utopia far removed from the reality of the world today. <br />Horowitz has done a masterful job again of showing why the left has lost its Communist moorings and is now adrift in a sea of nihilism, linking itself to fanatics such as the terrorists who kill at random throughout the world today.  <br />A short but most readable book. <br /> <br />	2004-10-13

This book must have been a great burden to assemble, and the facts that Fromkin has detailed, and put into much better perspective than most of his fellow historians of the period, are very important to understand his title of \\"The Peace to End all Peace\\". Some of the best sections deal with the trade-offs of the various governments after WW I who were exhausted and in financial ruin, or who just abandoned their greater responsibilities, like the USA. The whole issue of the \\"Jewish Conspiracy\\" of the Bolshevik revolution, anti-Semitism, Zionism, is dealt with in a very open and refreshing way.  But the problem with most of these books, whether it is Macmillan's \\"1919\\", or Kagan's \\"On the Origins of War\\", and other extraordinarily well researched and wonderful books is that they seem to be writing for an audience of their fellow academics and fail to understand the need for modern day historians to place history into proper perspective. I shouldn't pick on Fromkin because he is no more guilty of this than the hundreds of other authors of similar books, but after reading this wonderful book, I felt the same way I do two hours after a totally filling Chinese meal at my favorite restaurant across the street from my home. I'm hungry again. The essential conundrum that this book details is that the Balfour Declaration has set in place a situation where we have had, and probably will have, perpetual war in the Middle East. This conflict has now expanded all around the world, from the World Trade Center, Bali, Madrid, Kenya, Tanzania, etc and the dilemma for Western society is whether to abandon Israel and the Zionist dream in hopes that the Islamist fanatics will go back into their caves, or whether mankind can advance in an area which Islam has held the power for well over a millennium. Fromkin completely skates around this issue. While I am sure there is some lunchroom or annual convention somewhere where a bunch of academics who live their lives in minutia give points to the author of the book with the most extensive bibliography, they really fail the greater society in producing studies of historical value that places things such as WW I, the fall of the Ottoman Empire (or any other empire) in perspective. While they may argue that such was not the purpose of their book, in fact, much of history is an indictment of human nature to have to relive history over and over again. Historians need to get out of their shell and recognize the forest for the trees. If their works are to have any real value at all, it must be that they are written to advance mankind and not have us read such books and observe how foolish our ancestors were.  We know that. What a historian needs to do to be relevant is show us the common threads of the past so that we can avoid that path in the future. The fall of the Ottoman, Hapsburg, and other empires is really no different that that of Rome, the Greeks, the Tatars and the Khans, but seldom do you read a book that shows just how much of a treadmill this is for mankind. Churchill stood alone against the Nazis while the USA slept, and Bush if fighting the same ostriches who think that the Islamist fascists are somehow different, but on one connects the dots. If you want to read a book that shows what an extraordinary scholar Fromkin is, and he is, this is a great book to read, even though it will take a long time to do so.  If you want to read something that lifts you past the compilation of facts and details of the past and gives you something to think about how to shape the future so that we don't have to keep going \\"one step forward and two steps back\\", I recommend Harris' \\"Civilization and its Enemies\\" book as a much better use of your time.	2004-10-13

Reading newspapers or watching the \\"news\\" on TV can give you a sense that \\"realism\\" is seeing that American idealism is wrong-headed or just plain wrong. Franks is the consummate American success story of one man who started from very humble origins and became a great leader in a time of great danger. Franks early life is interesting reading as you can see how it shaped him and did not warp him, as so many recent \\"leaders\\" have been.  <br />Franks greatest contribution with this book however is to remind us that we are at war. And it is not a war that many people understand or are willing to even admit has been going on for a long, long time; long before George W. Bush came to Washington. If you are looking for a better understanding of how to place current events in \\"the war on terror\\" in perspective, including a much better explanation of what is at stake than anyone in the administration, or the opposition has done, you should read this book. Wars have killed hundreds of millions of humans over the millennia, and Franks shows us that going back to sticking our heads in the sand is a sure way to make that number increase by billions in the years ahead. While it is easy to second guess history, Franks shows us that we don't have the luxury of doing that and the decisions that have to be made, with less than perfect foresight are far more difficult than sitting back and saying \\"I told you so\\" once the facts are all in. It is obvious that 9/11 would have never happened if we had any of the kind of leadership in place in the 1990's that Franks represents. <br />	2004-10-08

One of the recipients of this book nearly had a heart attack when reading it because it was so effective in disabusing him of his liberal core beliefs that the bureaucrats who populate the faceless heartless beast of big government know best. He was fortunate enough to be able to leave Canada and its socialist medical system and come to the US before he died waiting for treatment. Hayek was one of those extraordinary humans who was unafraid to look the lion in the mouth and pull out his teeth when he wrote this during the detour to hell that freedom took in the era of the march of socialism across the globe during the 1930's, 40's and 50's and 60's. Few books have been so right at a time when so many of his fellow economists/philosophers were so horribly wrong. Whether it was the NAZI \\"National Socialism\\" the Soviet's communism, the Labour Party in the UK,  or the Democrat Party in the USA, among others, the title says it all. There have always been serfs in human society, some with more liberty to choose that path than others, but it is rare to find someone who can identify the root causes of poverty; economic, moral, and intellectual, as Hayek did. This is really one of the most important books in the history of human thought.	2004-09-23

This is a wonderful book to understand the history of mankind's desire to avoid war at any cost, even when it means that the consequences of doing so means that millions will die in the pursuit of peace.  Whether it is Chamberlain's claim that he had delivered \\"peace in our time\\" in his appeasement of a madman by the name of Hitler, or Kennedy's encouragement of Soviet aggression by his incredible weakness in dealing with a Khrushchev who saw him for the phony weakling that he was, this book drives home the fact that the bad guys will win if the good guys don't stand up.   Robert Kagan obviously learned a lesson in writing  \\"Paradise and Power\\" versus this book by Donald Kagan by cutting to the chase and understanding that the attention span of most Americans is the average length of a sitcom. If you want to understand why we have to keep learning history's lessons generation after generation, this is the book to buy. The peace movement is responsible for the deaths of more humans than any of the tyrants who filled the gas chambers, launched the bombs, starved the innocents, or invaded their neighbors. Kagan does a great job of showing how this has been the case since recorded history, and unfortunately we are too illiterate to understand this in an era when terrorists are identified by some euphemism like \\"freedom fighter\\" or dissident.  This book should be mandatory reading for any teenager in high school as an alternative to the politically correct nonsense that they are graded on and forced to read in schools across the country. Not to mention those who sit in their lounge chairs watching such inanities as \\"Friends\\" or equally idiotic nonsense.  This is a great book, but not a one day read if you pay close attention to the massive research and detai it encompasses. Hopefully this will be condensed into something thatis more approachable by the average reader.	2004-09-18

It is easy to take for granted everything that Rudy did during his public career in taking on the Mafia dons, and the malaise and terror that gripped the streets when his predecessors took the safe way out and did what was politically expedient instead of what was good for society. Two thousand murders a year, 10,000 felonies per WEEK, a welfare society that was draining the city of its lifeblood and chasing business away. It was a city where graffiti and panhandlers became the symbols of liberal failure to understand the basics of what a society needs to succeed. Giuliani was abrasive because he always was able to point out the silliness of the \\"limousine liberals\\" who talked about the need for marginal elements of society to enjoy the freedom to do what they wished, but at the expense of the majority of society to live without fear from them. While the NY Times editorial board would rail against every campaign that Rudy understood to make the city livable again, they always jumped in their limos because they were too afraid to walk the streets that they ruined with their liberal clap trap.  <br />This is a good book for anyone who is new to the New York City scene, or who needs some history on how the city could have become another decaying mass of inhumanity like so many other Democrat controlled major cities in the USA. <br />	2004-09-17

For many Americans, the end of the war, and the way that it ended was inevitable given the industrial strength of the North and the inroads made by Sherman and Grant into the Southern bastions. But there were choices available, and advocated, to surrender, such as continuing a guerilla war without a formal end. Had Lee chosen that alternative, the US as we know it would probably not have survived. With increasing opposition to the war in the northern states, riots breaking out as protests were suppressed over the draft, and with ever mounting causalities, it is easy to assume that northern politicians would have been forced to accept a truce and a dissolution of the union as the war dragged on into the 1870's. Slavery would still be permitted or reinstated in the Confederacy, the US would be torn as it expanded West on the slave issue, and the country would be a shadow of the industrial and military power that it became. Only a few men making different decisions prevented this from happening. General Lee is far more a hero for taking the position of statesmen and surrendering when many around him were adamant about continuing the fight. The quagmire of the Civil War, as with Vietnam, was as much a political one as it was a military one. If the same forces for compromise and bringing an end to the war been in place in 1865 as they were in 1972, slavery would probably still exist.	2004-08-28
US	53082166	R2IGZIE1CRF5G2	0895260174	829131114	Unfit For Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry	Books	5	5	7	N	Y	Read it before you form an opinion	With over 1200 reviews written about this book, it is obviously a hot button item, but in looking at a sampling of the reviews, the only ones that really count would seem to be people who have actually read it, which few if any, of the \\"one star\\" reviewers have actually done. Few of these people show any record of previous reviews, or the ones they have submitted are mostly with a far left wing point of view.<br /><br />One might debate whether Kerry was a \\"hero\\" for one of his awards, (and it could be only one of them at the most) but no one can debate that Kerry is a self-admitted war criminal. It is obvious that Kerry was someone who knew the \\"three purples\\" and you are out policy and it pretty obvious from eye witness accounts that he did not deserve at least two of them since they were self-inflicted and did not occur under enemy fire. But to me the most important parts of the book are not the specifics of who shot (or didn't shoot) John. Most telling are the Senator's own words which have changed so many times over the years as to make him someone who could never be believed. His testimony in front of the Senate in 1971 is based upon unverified and undocumented accounts of so-called veterans, most of whom never wore a uniform. He denied still being a member of the VVAW when that group was advocating the assassination of Congressmen, and only changed his story when the FBI released their records this year. When he was given his draft notice, he asked for a deferment to be able to study French for a year, but was turned down. Rather than be drafted, he joined the US Navy Reserves, not the US Navy and was unlucky enough to be activated. (The navy reserves were the Navy equivalent of the Air National Guard that Bush is so derided for joining.) Instead of having two tours of Vietnam as he claimed, his first \\"tour\\" included 5 weeks in the Tonkin gulf, not even within sight of Vietnam on a large ship that spent most of his one year tour off the coasts of California and Australia. When Kerry volunteered for Swift Boat duty, it was the safest tour in the Navy since it was really a taxi from big ships to safe harbors. He vehemently objected to reporting for duty when the mission changed. His first purple heart was awarded mysteriously after the attending physician said he had seen worse scrapes from a rose bush and refused to recommend him for one. It is no wonder that Kerry has refused to release all of his records. Especially since Kerry was the one who fired his weapon too close to shore and his \\"wound\\" came from a tiny piece of shrapnel from his own weapon, and there was no hostile fire that night anywhere near his boat.<br /><br />But the book is not just about \\"he said, he said\\" versus his fellow vets. It is a story of someone who took his own movie camera and \\"reenacted\\" fights which never occurred so that he could be, as he said himself, the \\"Next JFK\\".<br /><br />It is the story of a very flawed man whose record in the Senate could be predicted by his actions in Vietnam. If you really want to put someone in office who has no moral compass, than you couldn't find anyone better than Kerry, with the possible exception of the draft dodger the Democrats nominated when Kerry said Vietnam service shouldn't be a consideration for electing someone as President. But of course the imperious senator would brook no dissent from those opposed to him, as we see in his attack on the first amendment rights of his fellow Vietnam vets who happen to disagree with him about his qualifications for service as president. As Senator Edwards requested, the American people are spending \\"three minutes\\" with Kerry's fellow vets to find out what kind of man he is. Kerry's problem is that the \\"conversation\\" isn't limited to just the five he wanted us to hear from, we are hearing it from the hundreds who served on his boat, or within 50 feet of him, and saw him in action during his short four months in Vietnam before he finished manipulating the systemand ran for cover just as soon as he could. Now that those brave men who stayed for their full tour of duty (including many who could have left after they got their purple hearts) are speaking up, they are attacked by the same people who found no problem with multibillionaires funding their \\"527\\" sleaze machines against President Bush.ver just as soon as he could.

It would be hard to find a book better than this that deals with the impact of the human desire to forget the bad and pretend it cannot happen again in the future. If one measure of intelligence is the interval of the frequency between having to learn the same lesson again, Harris shows us that we don't have much intelligence at work today in dealing with world events. European isolationism today is very much like American isolationism was in the 30's. If you just ignore the problem, maybe it will just go away. It is ironic that the same problem is with us again today, less than three years after 9/11. As Harris says, the reason that WWII happened was that no one thought such a horror would be possible after WWI. We are on that same path today, as terrorists (or Islamic fantasists as Harris calls them) prepare for the next series of attacks. But this book is actually more than just a book about the modern day, and his analysis of cultures and societies long faded into history makes this an extraordinary book that is worth it just for that aspect alone. But civilization and its enemies go back much further than the latest islamofascist attack on modernity. Harris does a masterful job of showing just how those who enjoy the benefits of civilization and take them for granted are the ones who have contributed the least to keeping us from crawling back to the trees we climbed out of eons ago.	2004-08-27

It is a magazine article with expanded type to make is seem like a book. I can't imagine a worse author of how to deal with the international scene than the guy who thought it was a good idea to fund interational terrorists in the hopes of drawing the Soviet Union into Afghanisatn and creating a Soviet \\"Vietnam\\". While he may now claim credit for being able to walk the streets of his native Poland because the Soviet Union collapsed, he really has no idea of what he is talking about. Just like the New York Times gets to pick people to write on its Op-ed page, regardless of whether they know what they are talking about, Carter picked this blowhard to head up national security for the USA, and we will pay the price in thousand of American lives for generations to come.

If there was a real beginning of the modern clash of civilizations, it began on Brzezinski and Carter's watch. While the Islamic brotherhood had been building since the 1920's, it was only when these fanatics saw a weak USA that they began to expand their hatred into the West. Once we started funding the Islamic fanatics, and once we ran from them as we did when the mullahs ordered the imprisonment of American diplomats in Iran for 444 days until Carter and ZB  left office, we were in for serious problems for generations to come. But of course ZB ignores all this, and dismissed the impact of his decisions in his infamous interview with Le Nouvel Observateur in 1998 as just causing a \\"few stirred up Muslims\\" a.k.a. the Taliban and predecessor organizations to al Qaeda. Of course none of this important stuff is in this book. There has probably never been a worse foreign policy team than ZB and Carter. And now, ZB is baaaack to give us some more advice. Thankfully this book is short but it is full of the same kind of silly assumptions that led him and Carter to draw the Soviets into Afghanistan to create the \\"Soviet Vietnam.\\" <br />We are somehow supposed to establish diplomatic counterpoints to what is really a great religious based upheaval, one that he created. ZB's assumptions that the French are going to join the Russians and the US to counteract the forces of evil unleashed upon the world when ZB and Carter opened this Pandora's Box are just plain ridiculous. France has never looked at any alliance except through its commercial interests with a short exception when it was flat on its back during WW II. Russia is not a new player on the scene, and ZB's assumptions that somehow they will align their interests to the US and the West just to make the Islamists feel better and stop the attacks is beyond idiotic. If you want to read a book that describes a situation poorly and then comes up with even worse prescriptions for fixing the wrong things, then this book is for you. I picked this up thinking that he might have learned some lessons from his mistakes, but I was wrong. How this guy can even show his face, let alone give us some more bad advice is beyond me. <br />	2004-08-17

While the book actually covers more than just 6 months in Paris during 1919 as the allies dealt with the end of the Ottoman Empire, the demise of the Austro-Hungarian empire, and the costs of WWI. Macmillan does a good job of summarizing the events and the men involved. Most revealing to me in many chapters was the extraordinary naivet of Woodrow Wilson in representing America's long term interests as a world player. Not just his on-again, off-again adherence to the 14 points, but his total lack of understanding of domestic politics in getting the Senate to ratify the treaty of the League of Nation's. Many of the decisions made during the conference led to the events which shaped the run-up to WWII, not to mention the lines drawn in the sand to carve up the Middle East and laying the seeds of the problems that are with us today in the form of militant Islamists, the Palestine question and the formation of a Jewish state after WWII. A better book on the Middle East issue is Fromkin's \\"A Peace to end all Peace\\", but he is able to go into detail about a segment of the issues that Macmillan deals with. For the general reader who wants to know how we got to where we are today in world affairs, this book is a good start. While the armistice of November may have been celebrated as the end of the war, it really was just a temporary lull in major conflict, as many local wars continued for many years afterwards.	2004-08-14

Books	5	14	19	N	N	Dated but still important	Ledeen's book, written nearly two years before the 9/11 Commission report would have been a much cheaper and faster way for Congress to get to the same result; that the CIA has so lost its way that it will take a Herculean effort to make it effective in fighting Islamofascism. Ledeen points to the willingness of the Clinton administration to turn its head after the first attack on American soil in 1993 for the sake of political expediency. He also goes back into previous administrations, Republican and Democrat alike to see how the CIA has become \\"a cross between the Post Office and the Agriculture\\" department in efficiency and intensity in protecting the West from the onslaught of international terrorism. The parts of the book that are most telling is what the 9/11 Commission chose to ignore, the micromanaging of the CIA by Congress which slowly but surely turned it into a eunuch in the Middle East. Former Senator Torricelli's demands for an investigation are particularly amusing given his amendment which effectively prevented the CIA from employing the kind of agents we will need to infiltrate the terrorist cells active all over the world today, including in the US.<br />Ledeen writes frequently in his columns, and this book should have a three ring binder to attach more up to date information, but this book is still worth reading, if for no other reason to read the \\"politically incorrect\\" version of what the commission should have found.<br />I must admit that I am not as much an optimist as he is when it comes to the stomach of those in the West to do what is needed to win the fight. Americans are not much better than Europeans in understanding that this is a war which has been going on since 1979, and we have only just begun to fight it. Kerry's run for election and the Democrats current posturing will prove bin Laden right, that we do not have a sense of history, and the future looks to see millions in NYC or DC get vaporized by an Iranian or North Korean nuke before we wake up to the challenge.

This little book covers a lot of territory, but essentially it is an indictment of US policy towards Saudi Arabia, as well as the U.S. apologists employed by the Saudis to cover up their complicity in the spread of fanatical Islam all over the globe. Baer asks some serious questions about the West's reliance on Middle Eastern oil and the impact on the world's economies when the house of cards known as the Royal Family of Saud finally collapses from its own corruption. This book is a wake-up call for those who think we can continue to have it all in the USA; cheap gas and oil, sticking our heads in the sand when it comes to Saudi sponsored hate factories which turn out demented jihadists to commit acts of terrorism like 9/11, and thinking that somehow democracy is the answer to all of the problems we have funded in the name of fighting communism over the years. Baer pulls no punches in criticizing every administration since FDR, who have turned the other cheek in order to maintain the flow of cheap oil into the USA. Especially interesting for the Richard Clarke and Michael Moore brigades are the examples of how the Clinton administration was far more accomodating of Saudi duplicity and corruption than anything the Bushes have done, including turning away the chance to get bin Laden before he became a rock star. For those who think we can continue to rely on oil from the Middle East instead of developing our own reserves and alternative energy sources, this book should set them thinking. But of course once you do that, you have to get to the issues not in the book such as alternate energy sources, but only as long as Teddy doesn't have to look at the wind farms proposed for Hyannis, oil from Alaska and drilling off the coast of California, no nuclear energy development even though France gets 80% of its power that way, etc. Baer also gives a few lessons on how the CIA was so neutered that it was incapable of penetrating the numerous organizations such as the Islamic Brotherhood and other predecessors, affiliates, and allies of al Qaeda. Hopefully things are changing, but we are many years away from having a CIA that is anywhere close to being able to protect us from the threat of fanatical Islam, which is just as great a threat as Communist Russia was to Western Civilization before it collapsed.	2004-08-10
US	53082166	RG2QFZ4ZWUXL6	0393319113	30599896	Strange Defeat	Books	3	34	69	N	Y	Good title, strange analysis	While Bloch most assuredly was a patriot and served his country the best he could in both wars, his view of France and the French seems to be at odds with subsequent historical analysis. Bloch seems to blame the generals for the problems dealing with French impotence in the face of the Germans, but he doesn't seem to dig deep enough to examine alternative explanations, such as the fact that the French had not won a war since Napoleon and were fundamentally inept compared to other war machines. But since war is much more of a &quot;natural&quot; human state than peace, a society which does not educate and prepare for it is doomed to lose any battle where the enemy is better trained, disciplined, and focused. In many ways, Bloch's analysis ignores the political consequences of the lack of public understanding of the stakes at hand and instead looks at one aspect of examining the military humiliation of the &quot;Phoney War&quot;. France was too divided politically and socially to win any battle verses the Nazi war machine. In many ways his analysis is more appropriate to why the French lost Vietnam than why it lost France to the Germans. But of course that happened long after he had been executed by the Nazis. <br /> While this book has some good insights, it is not really anywhere near as good as Paxton's &quot;Vichy France&quot;, but Paxton had the benefit of historical records unavailable to Bloch; however Bloch had the benefit of living the history that Paxton reveals.  <br /> But unlike the cowards like Sartre who sat out the war and watched the Germans rape his native land while the Vichy politicians acted as their cuckolds, he fought for his country and had an opinion that France was to blame for its own ignominy, instead of modern revisionists who sit back and attack those who stood up to evil. <br />	2004-08-01
US	53082166	R2MUKQ132XR6DK	0375414576	786383328	My Life	Books	1	18	38	N	N	More revealing than he recognizes	It is amazing that the editors allowed this book to be published the way that they did. It is pretty obvious that the book started out to cover nearly every day of his life, but became much less detailed as publication date neared by virtue of the fact that his childhood teachers get more attention than some world leaders he dealt with as president. The book is very revealing in showing the side of Clinton that frustrated his friends and opponents alike. The evasions and half truths are skillfully mixed to blame others for his own sins while supposedly accepting responsibility. I am sure that when the full story of his presidency is revealed over the coming decades, that psychoanalysists will have a field day with what he posits as the truth when the facts all come out. Thus the Republicans are really to blame for his affair with Monica, even though he supposedly did it because he could. Ken Starr was far guiltier than Clinton in pursuing &quot;peripheral&quot; issues, even though it was Reno who dumped them into Starr's lap instead of getting another prosecutor. While the Clintons may not have been found guilty in Whitewater, many others were, yet that is somehow a vindication of his attacks on Starr. Why did he do his record number of pardons? It was his staff's fault in not telling him why he shouldn't even though they didn't even have 24 hours notice. But the book is actually a great document in having Clinton put on paper his view of his world. The fact that many of the &quot;facts&quot; he cites are simply not true, or have much more plausible explanations will allow future historians to place him in proper context.. <br /> But most will read this story and not change their minds about the man. Probably because for the true believers, the book does nothing to contradict his and their view of him, and for his detractors, it is so unbalanced and misleading that it reinforces what they know about his years in office. This book is more fact than fantasy; the problem is the facts about his grade school life are more than outweighed by important issues while he was president, and the treatment of many of those is pure fantasy. The good news is that this book has about 400 pages worth reading and you can breeze through the first half at a page every ten seconds without missing anything significant. Thankfully historians will have the final word, but we will have to wait to see what they say about one of the most brilliant politicians of any era who can never change the fact that this is the commander in chief who spent more time dealing with Monica than bin Laden, as the terrorists entered the country to do their dirty deeds. <br />  <br />  <br />	2004-07-31

When given a choice between watching some &quot;reality&quot; show versus reading about significant world events that can affect our lives, millions will chose who gets voted off the island versus understanding why Sept 11, 2001 happened. Kaplan digs deep into the real world, but would never reach the recognition rate of a tart who became famous for her disappearing cigar trick and became a &quot;star&quot; on her own &quot;reality&quot; show.<BR>What sets Kaplan apart from many of his fellow journalists is his hard work and sacrifice to get the story, enduring a lot of hardship to get to the real world as we never see it, and seldom read about. And his story is about the future of mankind instead of tabloid titillation which dominates the news, but is really the toilet paper of history. <BR>As someone who has traveled in many of the countries where Kaplan has developed his stories, I find his insightful observations and conversations with the real folk to put into perspective the superficial observations I have made, or read about from journalists who get the story from the comfort of their hotel rooms without ever getting their fingernails dirty. Even worse, his fellow journalists show up with their story already written and go home as soon as it is &quot;verified&quot; by talking to some propagandist, functionary, or peasant who fits their purposes. <BR>This is another very good book about the real world, including the vast disparity in the development of areas and peoples whose ancestors were the subjects of Marco Polo's travelogue. <BR>Americans can be very naive about the world, which is not surprising given the pitifully politically correct versions of history taught in all levels of schools today, but Kaplan has been there and experienced the world, with all its warts, and does a great job of putting it all into perspective. Like Polo's second excursion to Cathay, he went north and met the descendents of the same people who live in a world far closer to Polo's than the one we know today, seven hundred years later.<BR>While some of the events and people are changed from the book, it is a great book to understand the complexity of the forces dictating world events today in a very dangerous part of the world, the breeding grounds of the next phase of world conflict.	2004-07-11

It is not some hand-wringing exercise in &quot;do-goodism&quot; however, where the West is lectured on how it needs to spend more to assist the rest of the world join in on Western progress. Kaplan is able to point out the absurdity of a United Nations which collects billions from its member nations yet sits on its hands when it should actually be doing something because its membership is so broad, and so &quot;politically correct&quot; that it is impotent in dealing with those very situations that its charter points to as its reason for being. Having a nation like Libya or Syria sitting on its human rights commission is a joke, but no one laughs because it is just a small example of how the organization has lost its way, led by a small little-minded man called Kofi. The French, Chinese, Russians all have their reasons for opposing action where it needs to be taken, primarily for the same reasons they had in starting WW I and II. Their commercial and parochial interests come ahead of the greater good envisioned by the UN at its founding.<BR>This book is disturbing in its conclusions, but Kaplan has it right when he says that the only possible outcome in the world today is the anarchy he shows exists, and it is the wave of the future.	2004-07-10

But Paxton did a very good job of gathering good material from Nazi archives and others to deliver a book which required very little revision once more documents became available. <BR>The book was explosive when first published because it shattered the Hollywood myth of brave French resistance fighters arm-in-arm with the Allied forces beating back their German occupiers. The truth was much more complicated, but basically France was so politically divided in the 1930's that it was impotent in dealing with the threat of a Hitler. That impotence translated into the Vichy government led by Petain and his numerous cabinet officers who were far more likely to assist the Nazis than confront them. Double dealing, scheming, back stabbing, corrupt, duplicitous; the regime was a training ground for the kind of French diplomacy which continues to this day. Numerous attempts were made by the Vichy regime at reaching a lasting peace with Hitler and included proposals for France to be an ally with Nazi Germany's new world order after the Brits and later the Americans were defeated. It was only after the tide was turning against the Germans did the French resistance begin to gain popular support and shift to DeGaulle from Petain and his fellow collaborators. Even the Nazis were appalled by the lack of principle when the French offered up native French Jews for transport to German concentration camps when the Nazis never demanded they be turned over. French workers in Germany freed up enough manpower for Germany to field many more divisions than they otherwise could have been able to. While the same could be said of \\"neutral\\" Sweden, without whose willingness to supply the steel needed by the Nazi war machine would have forced Germany to cut back its standing army by hundreds of thousands, at least the Swedes have never tried to cover up the fact that they did it for the money. <BR>This is a very good book, and the kind of historical research which is sorely lacking in many books today which purport to cover history but usually wind up offering a hidden political agenda. For those who are interested in this subject I recommend Chabrol's video \\"Eye of Vichy\\" which is an amazingly brave film of Vichy propaganda that put pictures to the words of Paxton's book. With \\"friends\\" like France during WWII, we didn't need any enemies. The fact that France was given a permanent seat in the UN Security Council after its role during WWII is a living legacy of Roosevelt's infirmity in his last months.	2004-06-26

But the contents more than make up for its size. If you have read any of Hayes' articles in the Weekly Standard over the last year or so, you won't find a lot of new material here, but he does connect a few more dots, but also exposes the sad truth about journalists today- they are lazy and have a political agenda to discredit any evidence which does not fit the mantra of the liberals that there was no connection between Hussein and bin Laden. Hayes cites numerous examples of Saddam's funding of terrorists all over the Middle East, and complements Laurie Mylroie's books which links Iraq to the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. Abdul Rahman Yasin, an Iraqi native who mixed the chemicals for the 1993 World Trade Center, moved back to Iraq after the bombing and actually was paid by Saddam, as newly discovered records show. The supposedly &quot;discredited&quot; link of Iraqi intelligence meeting in Prague with Mohammed Atta, one of the 9/11 hijackers is examined in full, with the CIA &quot;sources&quot; who dismiss the claim looking more like the incompetents that they are. Hayes does a good job of dissecting stories published by the NY Times and the Washington Post which confirm their political agenda rather than objective reporting. One small example is their citing of al Qaeda leader Abu Zubaida alias Abu Zubayadah, alias Abd al-Hadi Al-Wahab, alias Zain Al-Abidin, alias Muhahhad Hussain, alias Zayn Al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, alias Tariq, alias Abu-al Hasanat, alias Noorud Din, alias Dawood, alias Kamil, alias Badar alias Al Mujahid,a Palestinian born at Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Zubaida has been the source of numerous pieces of information gleaned during his interrogation by the CIA and FBI at Guantanamo after his capture in Pakistan in 2002. Every threat cited by him (which actually resulted in an increase in the threatlevel being raised to orange last year) has turned out to be totally false. But he is cited as the source of &quot;credible&quot; intelligence by the Times and Post when he denies that there was any link between Iraq and al Qaeda, even though other al Qaeda leaders have said there were links. Now why should a thug who has been proven to be lying in everything he has told interrogators suddenly become credible when he said there was no connection. Yet his denial has become one of the cornerstones in the mantra that there was no linkage between Iraq and al Qaeda? Hayes cites numerous examples which shows the partisan political agenda of the left-wing media which refuses to be bothered by the facts, and their reliance on their &quot;sources&quot; in the US intelligence community. This is the same community whose failure is laid bare by the hole in the ground where the WTC once stood in New York. <BR>I am certain that there will be numerous reviews written by Bush haters who will never hold this book in their hands, but objective observers who want to understand why Iraq was one of the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; countries cited by Bush last year should get this book.

Those agencies failed to even read incriminating evidence, sitting in boxes in the District Attorneys offices in NY, which remained untranslated and un-investigated for years after the first World Trade Center bombing. The FBI and CIA bureaucrats must hate the fact that reconstruction of the WTC is taking so long because the gaping hole in the ground there now is a monument to their ineptitude. Mylroie is able to show a very plausible case of how Saddam assisted in the first WTC bombing. But since this goes against the grain of the bureaucrats and politicians in Washington, they do everything they can to discredit her findings. But it is very difficult to argue with the facts that were available to the agencies which pointed to a direct link between Saddam and Al Qaeda. Who was &quot;the Iraqi&quot; who suddenly appeared and assisted the bombers? Why were there so many phone calls made by him to Iraq while the planning was going on for the bombing? Why were the chemicals used in the bomb a formulation which Iraq was noted for? These and dozens of other facts make a very convincing case that despite the politically correct propaganda spewed by unnamed, and most definitely incompetent, &quot;sources&quot; at the CIA, Saddam had no problem working with his fellow terrorists, no matter what their name, including Al Qaeda. With all the bureaucratic finger pointing and rear-end covering, they still have not been able to dispute the facts Mylroie exposes in this book. It would be interesting to see what kind of help she could be to the US if allowed to be a bureaucrat oversight manager in one of our intelligence agencies. But of course that is covered in her newer book &quot;Bush vs the Beltway&quot; which is another indictment of our inept and incompetent intelligence agencies.ompetent intelligence agencies.	2004-05-17

While it is easy to see in retrospect that a monster was created by Jimmy Carter and Zvigniew Brezynski when they instigated the religious fanatics and started the Mujahadeen in 1979, to draw the Soviet Union into invading Afghanistan. (Or as Brezynski said \\"to create a few stirred up Muslims\\" to start a Soviet \\"Viet Nam\\"  in his infamous interview with Le Nouvel Observateur in 1998)  or also how they assisted the mullahs to depose the Shah of Iran, and emboldened the rise of Islamofascism. But we didn't know for sure what would happen. It was a throw of the dice, but a very loaded pair of dice at that.  Combine that with Reagan's cutting and running from Beirut after the murder of over 200 marines, and the funding of cesspools of hate in thousands of madrassas all over the world by the Saudis and their Wahabbi brand of Islam, you had a perfect storm brewing for a critical juncture where Islamic fanatics could develop their fantasies of ending Western civilization as we know it. But the one person who was in a position to actually do something about eradicating this menace before it achieved critical mass did nothing. All of the information came together on Clinton's shift, and he chose to dismiss it and dissemble, at the cost of thousands of American lives. This book has many interesting facts, including many obtained from Richard Clark, back when he had a very different opinion of his old boss before he flip flopped to make a fortune attacking Bush. Combine this book with the information we now have about Commissioner Gorelick's edict that the Justice department could not work to connect dots with the intelligence agencies, and you have a recipe for disaster. And that disaster was planned on Bill Clinton's watch. I can see that the Bush haters have been hard at work in ginning up reviews of a book they have never read, but this book is well worth buying for anyone who is interested in what really happened &quot;While Clinton Slept&quot; either with Monica or anyone else. For someone who was so concerned about his legacy, you would have thought he would have studied a little history instead of living by the poll numbers. We now will have to suffer the consequences for many years to come. Miniter has done a great job of letting us know just how and why it happened. This is a presidency that will live in infamy. And it was all so unnecessary.	2004-05-17

It is a very scholarly book, and not something for the casual reader, which makes it far too detailed for someone not familiar with the languages of the Middle East. It is easy to see why Islamists hate this book since it points out that over 20% of the Koran is indecipherable to even most Islamic scholars. It also shows the probable origins of the Koran from other material and writings available before Mohammed heard the voices which made him a prophet in the minds of some. While there are some interesting tidbits, such as Christoph Luxemberg's theory that the Islamic promise of sexual bliss with numerous virgins at every believer's disposal in the afterlife is probably a misinterpretation of the Syriac word for \\"white raisins\\" instead of doe-eyed virgins, this is a tedious book for the regular reader.  While I'm sure Luxemberg's theory will not diminish the supply of jihaadist lunatics, it does point out that a religion which condemns to death scholars who try to examine the basic document of this faith is a very scary threat to civilization all over the globe. The book also tells the stories of outrageous threats against some of those so condemned. Ibn Warraq (a pseudonym for a former Muslim who has been condemned to death by fatwas issued by mullahs of the \\"religion of peace\\" has done a great job of compiling these papers. I also got to learn that his pseudonym means \\"son of a stationer (or bookseller)\\"	2004-05-13

While most of the globe has seen conquest of one form or another, and in some places, many times, this is one book that puts the Crusades in perspective. The Crusades were essentially an attempt to reestablish a Christian presence in the Levant after its conquest by the Islamic forces which swept across Northern Africa and the Middle East after the death of Mohammed. Madden gives us many interesting details of how the Crusades were beaten back by divisions within the Christian community of Europe just as much as they were beaten by the followers of Islam. One of the most intriguing issues is the treatment of how the pagan and Jewish communities were displaced initially by the followers of Christ through conversion to Christianity without force of arms, followed by armed invasions of Islamists who took possession of the area by way of the sword instead of by way of persuasion. The Crusades were essentially a movement to take back these formerly Christian enclaves the only way they could, through force of arms inasmuch as the Koran and its interpreters and enforcers prohibits any kind of freedom of religion as we know it in the West today. It is one of the reasons that there are no Christian churches allowed in Saudi Arabia today, where even observing a Christian service is prohibited. A fact which is always glossed over by Islamic apologists who misrepresent history today. This book has a lot of history, without the stridency of Trifkovic's &quot;The Sword of the Prophet&quot; which is an equally good, if not better, book.	2004-04-13

This book pulls no punches, but it matches the topic it covers, which also pulls no punches. The best part of Trifkovic's book is that he distinguishes the shallow arguments of those who condemn supposed intolerance against Islam and puts the truth up for the light of day. His extremely good study of the &quot;evolution&quot; of Mohammed's thinking from a modestly tolerant sheep herder, to a fanatically ruthless dictator is especially good. While most of the defenders of Islamists today cite the earlier teachings of Mohammed, few can defend the man who grew ever more ruthless and obsessed as he collected his 15 wives, including the six-year old whom he finally brought to his bed at age nine. I have never heard a good answer to the question from a Islamist as to why such an enlightened religion, which is always condemning those who find fault with the premise of Islam and declares them to be bigots, cannot allow a church or synagogue to be built in Saudi Arabia. Trifkovic supplies the answer, but it is not one that Islamists want to hear since they don't have one themselves that makes any sense.<BR>What this book does is expose the ugly truth that the West is not in a war against terrorism, it is in a war of ideas, and the ideas we are fighting go to the very core of Islam and its supporters, not its margins. Once you have read this book, go read Lee Harris' \\"Civilization and its Enemies\\" to further your education on the extent of the threat to modernity and human society as we know it. There is a reason why the World Trade Center was attacked (twice) and the Pentagon was hit. Not to mention the murders of thousands of others throughout the modern world. Trifkovic debunks the nonsense that it was done because the 19 middle class hijackers were hungry. This is a very disturbing book, but essential reading for anyone who wants to understand today's challenges.	2004-04-13

Sartre seems to have been quite envious of Camus' courage, but could never seem to be able to do anything but convert his loathsome cowardice during WWII into attacks (in the safety of salons of Paris) on Camus after publishing the venomous review of Camus' \\"The Rebel\\".<br />Aronson's greatest failure in this book is to try to find a moral equivalency between Sartre, who supported violence in overthrowing colonial regimes except the colonialism of the Soviet Union which he supported, and Camus, whose virulent anti-communism was way out of the \\"mainstream\\" of much of European thought after WWII. While Sartre found every reason he could to support communist regimes around the globe, he ignored the fact that the Soviet system was really an evil empire far worse than any created by the West. Stalin's forceful death by starvation of over 20 million citizens of the Soviet Union went un-noticed by Sartre as he condemned the \\"Imperialists\\" of the West. Only after the Hungarian uprising of 1956 did Sartre abandon his blind allegiance to the Soviet Union, while still supporting communist hegemony elsewhere.<br />Camus, on the other hand is condemned for not supporting the overthrow of regimes installed by Western European nations, even though none of them came close to the brutal nature of Soviet imperialism in the Ukraine, Chechnya, and the other conquered satellites.<br />Aronson's book however is really just another attempt by admitted academic leftists in the USA and other Western universities to hang onto a discredited economic system which has failed in every country it has been tried. This book is essentially not about Sartre vs Camus, but about how Marxism and its supporters have been given a bum rap. It isn't the system that is bad, but it was only implemented improperly. If only someone would just do it \\"the right way\\" then the utopia promised by Marx and his followers would be able to blossom and relieve us of the ills of capitalism. By offering a theory which places Camus and Sartre as moral equivalents, where a supporter of freedom of thought like Camus is equal to an opponent of freedom like Sartre, the left tries to level the playing field of history where the lessons to be learned are ignored or dismissed as an aberration.  Only tenured professors who have never worked for a living or experienced the ravages of the philosophy he espouses could possibly write such a book. If you are looking for a book that deals with the issues that divided Camus and Sartre, you would be far better off reading \\"In Denial\\" or one of Jean Francois Revel's books.other Western universities to hang onto a discredited economic system which has failed in every country it has been tried.

Revel correctly points out that much anti-Americanism stems from the success of a capitalist society while Europeans and much of the rest of the world struggle under varying forms of socialism. The jealousy of the American success story has much to do with the criticism today. Africa today is impoverished not because of a lack of resources, but because it embraced a socialist and communist economic system which can only lead to impoverishment when wealth is not created, but \\"shared\\". Americans are criticized while Europe ignores the human rights abuses of Libya, the Sudan, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc. all at the same time profiting greatly from their commercial contracts with those regimes. In many ways, Europe today is little different from the Europe of the 1930's, small minded, and always looking for scapegoats which the Jews were in that era.<BR>Most amusing are the quotes regarding America being guilty of \\"unilateralism\\", long before George Bush rode into Washington.<BR>Revel's latest book updates \\"Without Marx or Jesus\\" in many areas, and it is much to his credit that many of his observations of thirty years ago are even more relevant today. While we are focused on terrorist threats to the world in this century, it is not a new issue. The French attempt to put down the terrorist uprising in its former colony Algeria, was far more brutal and indiscriminate than anything done by the Americans response to al Qaeda, but theFrench were trying to preserve their economic interests, and not trying to spread the \\"cult of liberty\\" that Beuve-Mery found to be a such a great danger while the Gestapo ruled the streets of Paris.<BR>This book, along with Kagan's \\"Paradise and Power\\" go a long way in explaining why American interests in Europe are much like the daddy who is hated by his rebellious adolescent. Left to their own devices, Europe will have to dig yet more graveyards for brave Americans who will have to save Europeans from themselves and their inability to learn from history again.	2004-03-27

(Mis)leads America	Books	1	18	145	N	N	In the finest liberal tradition	Eric Alterman has finally found a home at \\"The Nation\\" magazine, and his latest book attacking Republicans and George Bush is in keeping with the reputation of that magazine and its many contributors over the years. This book is another angry screed written by leftists for leftists. There is no subtlety in this book, despite what some reviewers imply (unless you are comparing this book to Mollie Ivans or Michael Moore and view them as \\"moderates\\".) It is amazing to me, that a magazine which has employed dozens of Alterman write-alikes, has never been forced to go back and defend itself for supporting regimes like Stalin's, who will go down in history as the greatest mass-murderer in history, who STARVED twice as many of his own countrymen to death as Hitler consigned to the ovens. The same is going to be true with this book, which is written as if everything which can possibly be known about events leading to the end of Iraq dictatorship under another mass-murderer called Saddam is known, and nothing else will ever be found out. Alterman and Green ( part of the cabal that made NYC so safe in his many roles in NYC politics that everyone was afraid to walk the streets after dark) have all the answers about Bush and his motives, without any examination of possible alternatives. Thus according to Alterman and Green, Bush, uniquely, found the end of Saddam to be a worthy cause, yet Alterman and Green ignore the 1998 Senate resolution, passed unanimously, and signed by Bill Clinton, that called for the end of Saddam's regime. While the Senate has never been bothered with having to be found consistent in its resolutions, you would think that Alterman and Green might at least make some reference to this official U.S. policy in effect at the time Bush proposed that Congress put its money where its mouth was since 1998 in getting rid of Saddam. There are dozens of other examples of similar \\"oversights\\" in this book, but for anyone looking for something besides the usual Bush-bashing from the left, you won't find it here.	2004-02-21

When you read over a hundred books a year like I do, you sometimes find yourself looking for \\"bargain\\" books to save a few bucks, especially if the subject is rather controversial. Who'd have thought you could find yourself feeling that you overpaid for a book that cost $2? This is such a book. Sartre is a phase that most kids go thru, like pimples, before they grow up and understand the world. Yes, we are here a short time and then we die. Get over it.<br />For Gerassi, a noted leftist, this book is more of an admission that he, like his friend Sartre, never grew up. While it is hard to read this book and not feel sorry for someone who will die an adolescent, I feel even worse knowing that the kind of nonsense Gerassi expounds about his fellow traveler in this book is probably standard fare dished out to the unsuspecting innocents in his political science classes at CUNY. What can you say about a book which fawns over a person like Sartre, whose entire life consisted of his fawning over mass murderers and criminals of the left? This book is a classic example of leftist snobbery, where Stalin's extermination of millions of Georgians, Ukrainians and others by starvation is ignored and the extermination of millions of Jews by an equally evil totalitarian criminal like Hitler is condemned. Sartre's equal admiration of mass murderers like Mao and Castro is made to look \\"enlightened\\" when it is simply outrageous. The only redeeming part of the book is that you can understand Sartre's narcissism and self-loathing to be possibly attributable to his warped childhood and excessive use of drugs and alcohol. I'd be nauseated and depressed too if I were as screwed up as he was.<br />What an unfortunate end of being and nothingness for a poor, naked, innocent little tree to give up its life to provide the paper this book was printed on.

If you think the current debate about whether President Bush \\"lied\\" about going to war with Iraq is interesting, you need to read this book. When FDR was running for his unprecedented third term, he won on a platform of keeping the USA out of the wars ravaging the rest of the world. <BR>In October, just a couple weeks before the 1940 presidential election, FDR said \\"The United States is at peace and will remain at peace. We will not participate in foreign wars. There is no secret plan or agreement that would or could involve the nation in any war.\\" FDR was elected on that platform, with polls showing the vast majority of Americans declining to get sucked into another war to rescue the Europeans from the marauding criminals like Hitler, Stalin, Mussolini, or Japan. Of course history has shown that to be an enormous lie. This book shows how FDR cleverly inched us into the war, first with \\"Lend Lease\\" then armed convoys, then the oil embargo of Japan, which forced Japan's hand and made Pearl Harbor inevitable. <BR>Unlike the shrill accusations against Bush today, Garrett only points to established facts, and not second guessing about whether there may have been intelligence failures. And he did this while events were unfolding in a world that most of us have forgotten ever existed. The loans to the Europeans to keep them from starving to death after WW I were repudiated and American generosity was turned against us by Europeans who thought we were just greedy to want our loans repaid. When Hitler was at their throats because the UK and France and others refused to bear the cost of defending themselves, it was America's \\"obligation\\" to save them again. One can see that there were many alternatives to expending American blood and treasure and forcing the US into war, not the least of which was to let Hitler and Stalin, the greatest criminals in world history, fight themselves until they both were eliminated from the world stage. Given the ingratitude the Europeans have repeatedly shown for our sacrifice, it is an interesting scenario to contemplate.<BR>The editorials also cover much history regarding Woodrow Wilson, the League of Nations, the \\"America First\\" groups, the American Communist Party as a puppet of Stalin, and much more. The book shows the extraordinary, behind the scenes coordination of the administration and \\"outside\\" groups to march the country to a war it did not want, and thought it was voting against when it reelected FDR. <BR>This book is a great source of many good quotes, and shows why Congress has never declared an official war since then.<BR>One facinating sidelight is a speech given by then Attny General Robert Jackson, soon to become Supreme Court Justice, and he of the famous quote that the \\"Bill of Rights is not a suicide pact\\" advocating legislating from the bench and using judicial powers to act more like dictators than jurists. He might well be called the grandfather of the liberal judicial activists who permeate the bench today.<BR>Of course FDR may well have been right, and leading Americans into a war they said they did not want, in spite of themselves, may be one of the reasons that democracy survived the onslaught of the totalitarian criminals who ruled Germany and the Soviet Union, but if so, FDR must also then be called the greatest liar in the history the United States, too.	2004-01-27

While the Clinton and Bush administrations get their fair share of the blame, the real story is the decades-long decay and decline of the CIA and other agencies, going all the way back to the Church days when the liberals assumed that the world would be safer without a vibrant and healthy intelligence network protecting the US from the kind of savages who killed thousands of innocent Americans on 9/11.	2003-09-02

It has enough red meat to keep you going for months. There is nothing in here which an objective observer of events as they occured could possibly agree with. If you want a book title that fully describes the contents, you need not even open the cover. This is a classic example of why political discourse in this country has become so raw. &quot;Facts&quot; which are substantiated by numerous references to nothing but rumor, repeated ad nauseum until it can only be called a polemic which declares war on freedom. I had thought that Oliver Stone's conspiracy theories were the ultimate in nonsense until I read this book. I must confess that I cheated and only read two thirds of it since the book could easily be condensed to thirty pages if the repetition were taken out.<BR>What a waste of paper.	2003-08-21

Is Limbaugh conservative? Well, last time I checked he was. Does he pretend to be a newscaster? Never.<BR>Did the publisher of the New York Times say he would rather see an American soldier die in a fight with a Communist in Viet Nam? Yes he did and has never denied it. Does that make him one the the conservative elites who control the media? I don't think so.<BR>Alterman's book is a classic example of left-wing writers who just \\"don't get it.\\" He thinks he is \\"mainstream\\" when the radical journals he writes for wouldn't hire a conservative if their lives depended on it.<BR>This book is good fantasy for his fellow travelers, but is pure garbage when it comes to telling \\"The Truth.\\"<BR>Save your money.	2003-03-02
US	53082166	RART31R4DHORY	0895261901	148709607	Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News	Books	4	8	13	N	Y	A wake-up call for a dead profession	Given the ravaging that is already taking place, it appears that the &quot;news&quot; industry will try to destroy Goldberg's reputation rather than engage in the kind of introspection this book invites. If you wonder how a profession can get itself in a position where used car salesmen have more credibility than the multi-millionaires who now dominate the &quot;news&quot; business, you must read this book. Goldberg is probably right in his view that the Dan Rathers of the world live in such an isolated bubble that they cannot relate to the real America. It is probably why the news programs of the elite media continue to decline in ratings and credibility. The new &quot;Flat Earth Society&quot; is revealed by a professional who will suffer the same fate as those who advocated a round world, condemnation by the protectors of the faithful liberal elite who couldn't recognize objectivity if it jumped up and bit them. It just has.<BR>This is a great book.	2001-12-05
