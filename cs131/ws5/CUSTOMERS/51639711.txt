The written word keeps the image steady, unwavering, like a lighthouse beam, steady on.  It keeps the goal, the intended consequence in mind.  <br />When you focus on the outcome, write in the present tense, as though you were describing something that is already happening.  It call it \\"writing as reality\\".  Be sure to date your description, because when you read it back later, you will have an eerie sense that you wrote it after it took place rather than before.<br />Now dig deeper.  Not just the outcome, but the outcome of the outcome.  Don't just write about what you want, but include why you want it.  Why does it make a difference whether you have this or not?  And then keep going deeper - why do you want that?  And then deeper still, the outcome of that second outcome and so forth, until you hit the core of it.&quot;<br />Very good book for going deep within yourself for the answers that you already have.	2001-06-17
