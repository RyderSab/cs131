If you do not understand why anyone would leave a high paying, high profile job writing speeches for a person whom most would agree was the most powerful person in the world to go build a boat, then you should not read this book. You will not get it. If the corporate ladder holds no glory for you, then this is your book. <br /> <br />I give the author a lot of credit for having the nerve to do what most money hungry Americans would never understand. Pollack had a dream to build a boat of corks since he was a little boy. Now at the age of 34 he had decided to follow his dream, a crazy idea at best. Nevertheless, he chose to follow his dream. I wish I had his guts. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this to anyone that has ever had a crazy dream and is too scared to go for it. Pollack should be an inspiration to us all. Thankfully, he is also a witty and interesting writer. jay. <br />	2005-10-09

This is the only I've ever read by Rendell and to hear the reviews you'd think it was going to be the most interesting, heart racing book ever ... which critics are rating this book!?  I usually only read nonfiction and after I read this, I think I'll stick to what I know.<br /><br />This book was overly simplistic and just plain ridiculous.  I could have told you the ending by page 50.  It was supposed to take place in current time but you would never know it by how some of the characters spoke.  The plot was laughable the ending was just plain stupid.  This book was aggravating to read, my husband had to hear me constantly yell, `oh, you've got to be kidding me with this crap'.<br /><br />I'm not big into fiction, I get more out of a story that I know actually happened however if you want a good suspense fiction book try `Tell No One'  and at least get your moneys worth.	2005-10-09

It is difficult to tell exactly what is taking place. The narrator speaks in third person who is quite annoying at first but you get used to it; does not last through the whole book. Soon it becomes clear that Hiro is a pizza delivery boy who also thinks he is a samurai.  <br /> <br />Please don't stop reading after the first fifty or sixty pages as I almost did. I promise that it starts to make sense. The whole book is not about the process of future pizza delivery. If you stop, you will miss some of the best speculative fiction ever. Hiro must figure out who is unleashing a virus that can destroy minds through the Metaverse (the future internet). Rarely had a book raised my adrenalin levels as much as this did.  <br /> <br />I must admire an author who can take such a silly seeming idea and infuse it with so mush life and thankfully, Stephenson is writing faster than most people can read. From the reviews, it seems that this is something to be thankful for.  <br /> <br />Highly recommended to any Sci-fi fan not only hackers and programmers (I can barely check my email). jay. <br />	2005-10-09

As formative events go, nothing else comes close; my careening zigzag existence, my wounded brain and faith in God, my collisions with joy and affliction, all of it has come, in one way or another, out of that moment...\\" <br /> <br />Thus, starts the life of Edgar Mint. If the first few sentences don't grab your attention, then you may want to look elsewhere. However, if, as I did, you read those sentences and are filled with a longing to find out how Edgar got there and where he went to after, read on and enjoy. <br /> <br />Though you may be able to tell from other reviewers that this is not a happy story, you may find yourself laughing enough to feel ashamed. Poor Edgar has a life that just does not seem to let him have one moment of peace. Since his alcoholic Indian mother has disappeared after his head is crushed, he now has to stay in the hospital ward with no company except other invalids. He grows to love this group and finds in it comfort. He also finds comfort in his blue urinal cake, which he rubs to keep the ghosts from haunting him. Ha! Eventually, he has to say goodbye to his new and only friends and goes to live with a distant uncle in the basement of Willie Sherman's school for Indian children. There, he has to learn to live in a world where, to be noticed is to be hit in the head with rocks and beat up on a daily basis. This is only the first of his adventures and they would all be unbearably sad if it weren't for Edgar's constant wonderment at life's small miracles. \\"How can I explain the wondrousness of walking barefoot across carpet for the first time?...

If you want to be a writer, Anne is first going to try to figure out why. She lets you know right off the bat that being published isn't going to make you a happier, healthier or even (in most cases) a richer person. Her greatest lesson is that writing is its own greatest reward. This is the main reason why I bother to write reviews.    Anne Lamott is one of the most perceptive and humorous writers I've ever had the pleasure of reading. She has a way of making the mundane fun again. It's as if you are a child once more and everything is magic. In one section, she even manages to sway me, an avowed sports hater, into seeing the magic of being at a sporting event, and being part of a larger whole. Heck, it even made me want to go out and get tickets to the Sunday game. Not only that, but I found myself laughing while reading. A lot. Moreover, I read in public, but with this book, you will not care how many people give you funny looks. If that isn't an example of picture perfect writing, I don't know what is.    In addition, if you consider yourself a \\"conservative\\" you may not like this book. Her outlook on religion is not that of your average congregation and she likes to swear.

You have to respect an author that is willing to take the title of his book from the master Shakespeare. Furthermore, Bradbury manages to incorporate myriad ideas for young and old into one true feast for the senses. No matter how many times I read this, I am always struck by the poetic manner in which the story is told. <br /> <br />This is the story of Will Holloway and Jim Nightshade, and how they outwit the evil carnival and its twisted custodians. Seems like a great idea for a kid's book, yeah? And it is. However, add in thorough discussions on the nature of growing old and the character of good versus evil and what it means to be one or the other, and you have a dissertation worthy of any graduate student. All this is told in Bradbury's characteristic bouncy, playful syntax and is always a consummate pleasure to read. <br /> <br />This is required reading for the imaginative child or the adult looking to reconnect with their youth and the wonder therein. <br />	2005-09-25

New Gods are destroying the old. The internet, money and science among others are waging a war on Gods of old. However, who is the instigator in this battle? And what part does ex-con Shadow play?<br /><br />In a world of constantly evolving beliefs and morals, this book stands to try to explain why we as Americans feel pressure to change our spiritual selves. Using Shadow to stand for our evolving society Gaiman shows how we WILL make it out the other side and how the new and old can coexist.<br /><br />With that said, the best parts of this book are the small bits of historical fiction interlaced with the main story that explain how some of the gods came to America in the first place. It has piqued my interest in old religions and an interest that goes beyond a book is the highest acolyte I can give.	2005-09-25

The only other example of this is that I can think of is the movie \\"the Ring\\" when the actors look out at the crowd at the end.  <br /> <br />This is the story of a parallel history in which Japan and Germany won WW2 and takes place on an occupied America (Japan, west coast, Germany, east). An author in this novel writes a book describing an America that won WW2. <br /> <br />This is simply a great book and I wouldn't even classify it as Sci-fi only as fiction. By the end of the book, I felt as if I knew the characters personally. I especially empathized with the storeowner and his search for a place and a meaning in his world. Did you figure out why he couldn't?  <br /> <br />If you don't like to think through ideas on your own without having the author spell them out for you then this is not the book for you.

If you've come to this book to learn how to dominate your workplace, bend nations to your will, or even just to learn how to get your wife to obey, then you'll not like this book. Many reviewers have stated that a myriad of the laws listed are contradictory. Well, one technique that works fine for one person is going to fail miserably for another. Furthermore, it's all about context. Certain situations call for different tactics. All the reviewers who supposedly read this should check and see that at the end of each chapter, Greene shows examples of when the rule didn't work and of when the opposite of the rule worked. It's all about context. Now, why would you want to gain more POWER anyway? Are you unhappy with your life? Do you think that by some trick, power will make you any better of a person than you already are? If you really want to learn how to get power, surreptitiously even, then try the book \\"How to win Friends and Influence People\\", by Carnegie. Or you could just keep being a j@ck@ss. <br /> <br />Now, if you love history and I mean any history, because this jumps all over the place, you'll love this. It is filled with stories about world leaders, kings and popes told in a fluid writing style and in an attention-grabbing format. <br /> <br />This book is invaluable while surrounded by people striving for power, i.e. most Americans. At least you'll see their tricks coming. <br />	2005-09-22

It is huge, even by biblical standards and is going to be a pain in the a$$ to lug anywhere, but that didn't stop me from reading the Cryptonomicon (by the end that book was a battered mess) and loving it. <br /> <br />If you've read the Cryptonomicon and fell in love with the main characters, you will understand immediately. I am by no definition of the word a \\"quick\\" man, but upon reading the name Enoch a strange feeling came over me. Then, later in the chapter, the name Von Hoek popped into my sight. Anyone who has read Cryptonomicon will recognize these uncommon names post haste. At that point, I turn to the back of the book and gaze at the names in the synopsis. That was my moment of realization. I saw the name Waterhouse. How could I have not seen this before? I am struck by my utter obliqueness.  <br /> <br />I feel now as if I'm reading of the ancestors of that previous book and it makes me feel, even though I know the characters are fictitious, like I've already lived with these people. If you've read the Crypto then you know how long I had to live with those superb characters.  <br /> <br />Many reviewers have stated that they found the book agonizingly boring and I would agree if I had not read Crypt. Nevertheless, having done so I can say that I cannot wait to get back to reading it and find out how the great great great grandparents of Shaftoe and Waterhouse are doing. <br />	2005-09-22

Before reading this, you may want to ask yourself if you can tolerate an entire book that is mostly about another book. The book is over 500 years old and is real (Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: The Strife of Love in a Dream by Francesco Colonna) but the story here is entirely fiction, good fiction at that. However, it is not for everyone. If you love a good mystery and are even moderately scholarly, then you will love this.  Most of the book revolves around the lives of three friends, their differences and struggles to find meaning in their lives. All the while, they are tracking down a mystery/puzzle that they believe was hidden in the Hypneroto.'s pages. This may bring back fond memories of late night cramming at the library or give you a hint at what it will be like, if you're lucky. However, if you have a hard time sitting through an entire episode of \\"Cribs\\" then you might want to wait for the movie.	2005-09-22

I, like many others, have read most of Tom's books and while some of his main characters have been slightly annoying (Still Life with Woodpecker, anyone?), Matti takes the cake. Don't let her character dissuade you from reading the book. Her character is a money-grubbing stockbroker containing no true love or passion for life. She is intended (I believe) to represent the consumer in all of us, albeit the worst parts. She is not supposed to be likable. A likable Matti would have taken away this stories point: how even the most vile, egotistical, greedy person can transform, or should I say be pushed to transform when the stakes are raised high enough. The story begins at the start of a four-day weekend, just after a major stock crash. Matti is in jeopardy of losing her job, she can't even make the payments on her new Porsche, boo-ho! Moreover, the boyfriend that she's been dating because of his giant paycheck has decided to give it to charity. On top of everything, his monkey gets loose (did I mention that this monkey was trained to steal jewelry and that the aforementioned boyfriend has taken it upon himself to convert the monkey to Christianity?) and may be heisting peoples belongings. Craziness! <br /> <br />As always, Tom's writing is spectacular and you'll be learning arcane bits of knowledge on every page. Some of his ideas are crazy, but deep down are not all ideas crazy? <br />	2005-09-22

I am giving this five stars because of the skill with which China Mieville manipulates the English language. He brings to the page a world that may remind you of ours only as seen through a distorted and evil funhouse mirror. Everything that is bad and wrong in this life is heightened exponentially. The government has a militaristic strangle hold on its citizens, crime and corruption seem to be commonplace in every aspect of life and pollution, garbage and decay are bywords of the environment. Maybe Mieville is showing what could be if we are not careful. <br /> <br />I will not trouble with a synopsis as others and Amazon has done that better than I ever could, but it will suffice to say that this is not a happy story. Many very bad things happen and there is almost no redemption for any of the characters. Many will notice that the end is more realistic of what would happen in the real world. <br /> <br />If you liked \\"Neverwhere\\" by Neil Gaiman than you may like this, although Perdido Street Station is more visceral in it's violence. If you like happy conclusions then look elsewhere. <br />	2005-09-22

After reading about Kenneth's' visits to the Amazon forest, underwater caves, and the top of Mount Everest, to name a few, you may be struck by the explorer bug too. Ken's main job on the excursions in this book is to act as main medical advisor, but thankfully, he is also a grade A writer. He recounts his trips; I will not spoil the book by recounting them here, from a mostly medical point of view. At heart Ken is a humanist seeking to find out how and why the few who choose to live in the extremes, (95% of the earth is uninhabitable by humans) do so. He goes into great depth describing the cultural and physical adaptations that people under-go. After many generations living a rough life natural selection has weeded the weak and stupid away leaving only the most suited for survival in any given \\"extreme\\" area of the world.  <br /> <br />Don't let the title scare you off. This isn't a gimmick book that slathers its tile with the adjective \\"extreme\\", this is truly meant in a most literal fashion. If you are intrigued by the inner workings of the ER or even the TV show ER, then I would recommend this to you. If you have read the best seller \\"Into Thin-Air\\" by Jon Krakauer, you may be interested in the fact that Kenneth Kamler was the ill-fated expedition's doctor on the spot and he has recounted his point of view of the tragedy in one of the chapters.  <br /> <br />Some of the places you'll visit and learn the many ways you can die (and the slim chances of your survival):  <br />1. the Amazon jungle  <br />2. lost at sea (above)  <br />3. the heat of the desert  <br />4. the pressure of the deep sea (below)  <br />5. the top of Everest  <br />6. and the vacuum of space  <br /> <br />After you read this, you'll be able to amaze your friends with your knowledge of cannibalism and butt parasites. <br />	2005-09-22

This novel jumps from present day Sarajevo in 1993 to, in the next chapter, Long Island in the 1980's. In Sarajevo Falk fights to stay alive and find stories as an inexperienced and naive freelance reporter, back on Long Island he fights a long and horrible depression that started for no reason and for twelve long hard years showed no signs of ever ending. John is convinced that no one can help him and all he can do is try to hang on and hope everything goes back to the way it was.  <br /> <br />Through the book, we see all aspects of his life and get to know Falk better than most of our closest relatives. It made me wonder how many of my close friends are secretly battling depression. John eventually does see a psychiatrist, and after a few different medications finally finds relief. After college, he sets off to find himself and ends up in Sarajevo alone again. However, with the help of Zoloft he knows that nothing is hopeless.  <br /> <br />As a depression survivor, I would recommend this to anyone that thinks that they are alone without hope or anyone that has ever been comforted, as Falk was at one point, by knowing that they can end their life anytime. I know I have made the book sound depressing but Falk is a wonderful writer and the novel has many funny and uplifting moments.

I'll start by letting you know that I read the book about ten years ago. I was looking through my libraries meager selections of books on CD and happened to see this, and having always been a fan of Kurt V. I decided to give it another go. <br /> <br />Have you ever heard Stanley Tucci act? No, I guess you mostly see him act, if you even know who he is. While he reads this book, it seems like just that: reading. I have listened to many books and most of the time the reader is a skilled storyteller. Stanley, I am sorry to say, is not. He gives no difference to any of the characters in the book; they all sound just like him talking. This was not my favorite Vonnegut book to begin with and Tucci's voice did not make it any better. <br /> <br />This novel reminds me of life as a train wreck. One can see Kurt at the throttle of his locomotive, plowing over all the characters while heading towards its ultimate derailment at the end of the book. I do not know his personal situation at the time of writing, but I'm guessing that he was drinking heavily and having suicidal thoughts. I am surprised he didn't kill himself after sobering up a few years later and finally reading this, because he obviously did not proof it. <br /> <br />Vonnegut has stated that this is one of his least favorite books. So, if you have to read them all than go ahead. At the very least, it will give you insight into the mind of a genius. <br />	2005-09-21

I hope that 'Ford' is just the word that replaced 'car' or 'vehicle' in one of the most interesting portions (a corporate controlled, clone fueled Korea) of Mitchell's most recent work. It is also sad that most who start out reading this may never make it to that story. I myself would have never finished Cloud Atlas if I had not been listening to it on compact disk to supplement the book.  <br />  <br />The first couple of stories, while interesting to me, are in a highly stylized lexicon that may put off many readers. The first such story takes place in the 1850's and is that of Adam Ewing, who is on an expedition in the Pacific Ocean. If you're used to the dialogue and situations of most TV shows you'll be scratching your head and cursing the dork that recommended this to you. So, let me save you the trouble of trying to read this. That way you will not miss that rerun of Desperate Housewives you've been dying to watch. <br /> <br />The six stories in all follow the pattern a-b-c-d-e-f-e-d-c-b-a. During the first time through (a through f), the stories are cut off in mid stride. A trick so brilliant that I do not think I could have stopped reading/listening if I wanted to. I needed to get to the second half of the book (f through a) to discover the conclusions of the first half. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have tried to link the many incidences of coincidence that occur thru out the stories. Some think this novel is a diatribe against the evils of corporations. They may be correct. I, on the other hand, believe Mitchell just wants to tell a great story while exemplifying the '6-degrees of separation' as functioning through the course of time. All of the narrators and characters link to one another in small, almost random ways. Mitchell's explanation of this is not forth coming and seems to be the topic of debate among reviewers. Thus, in my opinion adding to the novels appeal. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this to any Neal Stevenson fan (esp. of the Baroque Cycle) or any erudite reader with a considerable attention span. Happy reading. <br />	2005-09-21

This and much more alliteration await you in this first chronicle of Dexter and his \\"dark passenger\\". Dexter is the brainchild of first-time author Jeff Lindsey. This makes me wonder about a person who seems so well in tune with the sociopathic mind. You see, Dexter is a serial killer, not just any serial killer. He only kills other, more heinous killers (killers of kids and helpless women, so far). He meticulously seeks out and tracks these evil doers while in the process of making a living at the Miami police office, as a blood splatter analysis technician. Oddly, Dexter hates blood! <br /> <br />The story follows Dexter as a new killer enters town. This normally doesn't bother Dex but this new killer seems to be following him, and even taunting him to the point of breaking into his apartment and leaving him clues as to his identity. <br /> <br />Now, at first I thought the story was a little rushed and I wanted more background on this awesome character. I was willing to attribute this to first time author folly. However, I have recently seen that Lindsey is writing a series of books about Dexter and fleshes out his past and family history more thoroughly. <br /> <br />Highly recommended to anyone who loves dark humor (Palahniuk is a good example). I can't wait to read the next! <br />	2005-09-21
US	13529771	R6I2PTMU11JUB	0060733489	911494096	Beggars in Spain	Books	4	4	5	N	N	A people divided.	In the near future biological advances allow parents to choose certain biological traits for their impending children, one of which is sleeplessness. At the outset, this \\"child upgrade\\" is highly sought after. Parents soon realize that the amount of work involved in raising a child who never sleeps is astronomical; it also takes a high psychological and physical toll on both parties.  <br /> <br />Once grown, the first group of sleepless is seen as a boon to society. Their advancements in science and economics are hailed as miracles. As more and more sleepless grow the \\"sleepers\\" start to realize that they are going to have to compete with a group that many see as having an unfair advantage. A schism starts to form in society between the sleepers and the sleepless.  <br /> <br />The novel follows mainly the Camden sisters- twins, Liesha and Alice. Liesha is a genetically altered sleepless who's birth was planned. However, another egg is fertilized accidentally during the pregnancy. Alice is the product of that accident; she is a completely unaltered sleeper. Envy and animosity abound on both sides.  <br /> <br />Nancy Kress has a real gift for characterization. One of the best parts on this novel is the incredible people and their realistic interaction.  <br /> <br />It took me two weeks to read the first 80 pages and only three day to read the last 320. It takes awhile to warm-up but it is worthwhile. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves great writing, not only sci-fi. <br />	2005-09-21

If you think that the carnage described with-in it is some type of ridiculous distortion (as some reviewers seem to think) of real life in war, then you may need to read up on your military non-fiction. Try Dispatches, by Herr or for something closer to our current era check out Black Hawk Down, by Bowden. These are not Sci-Fi but display a lack of humanity in war that rivals anything in Broken Angels.  <br /> <br />Do not make the mistake of thinking Broken Angels is glamorizing war. It merely shows it for what it is and always will be- young and old, men and women, solders and civilians dying for no other reason than the whims of the ruling class, for profit and power.  <br /> <br />Finally, for any reviewer opining on how Morgan's writing is so violent and sexual; let me remind you that shows like 24 and Desperate Housewives are not about math and baking cookies. Whether you realize it or not, sex and violence are just as popular in the Blue states as in the Red. What I'm getting at is, at least in Broken Angels the writing is somewhat erudite with some form of intelligent dialogue on the nature of war, and the violence illustrated in the book makes you sick and angry (as it should). The stuff on television has no such qualms. Its only purpose is to get you to tune in next week. <br />	2005-09-21
US	13529771	R2GN6OSUGRJBCW	9997414365	289202770	Gateway	Books	5	1	1	N	N	Don't judge this book by its cover!	Along with Enders Game by Orson Scott Card, this has the crappiest story to cover ratio ever. I have a terrible habit of letting the cover of a book influence me. Thankfully, my better judgment prevailed. I read this book in two days and had to drag myself away from it the first night (at 2am, I had to get up at 6am).  <br /> <br />The chapters are set up so that one takes place in the present and two is a sort of flash back and so on. This makes it compulsively hard to put down. To me that is one of the most important qualities in a book and this one does it perfectly.  <br /> <br />In the future, an asteroid is discovered containing hundreds of automated space ships that are capable of faster than the speed of light travel (the problem is that you don't really know where the ship is going, if anywhere). The beings who built the ships are long gone. Leaving no trace as to what happened to them or where they went. Therefore, humans take it upon themselves to inhabit the asteroid and send \\"Prospectors\\" out in the ships to search the stars. A lot of them don't come back.  <br /> <br />The book is essentially an interview between one of the most famous and wealthy Prospectors (prospectors get a percentage of the profits on any thing they find), Robinette, and his computerized therapist. As you get deeper into the book the tension mounts and spirals towards an incident too painful for Robinette to speak of, terminating in one of the most satisfying endings of any book I have ever read. <br />	2005-09-21

I am twenty-seven now but reading about Harry, Hermione and Ron brings me right back to the depths (and heights) of my adolescents. I remember liking certain girls and never knowing how to show it, and I remember the jealousy I felt towards those who didn't get tong tied at the sight of a pretty girl. Ron and Harry both undergo this.  <br /> <br />J.K. Rowling must be a wonderful mother because she shows empathy for the troubles of young adults that most \\"young adult\\" writers do not. <br /> <br />If you have not read any of the series yet all I can say is, \\"What are you waiting for\\"? If you start now you may be able to catch up by the last book, if the seventh really is the last! <br /> <br />If you have read the others, buy this quick before it goes back up to regular price, $29.99! You will not be disappointed that you did. <br />	2005-09-21
US	13529771	R1YGFJAUVZ23LU	0375700293	932067568	Bringing Out the Dead	Books	5	2	2	N	N	The haunted offspring of Vonnegut and Heller.	In Vonnegut's writing and even more so with Heller's, while funny, you cannot help but know that the humor is hiding a pain so great that it threatens to crush the reader and narrator. Connelly, while having a different writing style, has the same dark humor that fans of the above authors may respect. One good example is a scene in which Frank and his paramedic coworkers get drunk and create their own emergency site in the bar, complete with sheet covered pseudo-corps and one drunk paramedic giving the dead last writes while splashing the body (a passed out buddy) with holy water, aka liquor. I haven't done it justice but you'll just have to trust me when I say it is a funny scene indeed.  <br /> <br />Now, if you're the bipolar or easily depressed type you may not want to read this book. While it does give great insight into the lives of those who work to rescue us every day, the narrator (Frank) leads a downtrodden life that would make any would-be paramedic rethink his/her career choice. Every street is home to multiple nightmarish job calls and Frank starts to lose his grip on what is memory and what is actually happening in the moment. Ghosts seem to stalk him wherever he goes, managing to ruin almost every aspect of his life.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this to anyone who loves a great and emotional story with lots of wry, black humor mixed in. However, be warned that this is not for the easily broken hearted. If you do decide to read BOtD I would recommend that you pay close attention to characters mentioned only in passing at the outset of the book, as many become key characters towards the end. <br />	2005-09-21
US	13529771	R4VKSMCK0CHKJ	0679751521	523621984	Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil: A Savannah Story	Books	5	4	6	N	N	What's so interesting about a town full of inbred hicks?	First up is your Nazi flag waving reclusive millionaire, Jim Williams, he refinishes furniture with the help of unstable young men (wink, wink) in a house that many consider to be the pinnacle of Savannah manors.<br /><br />Next up is the neighbor Joe Odom, who has a twenty-four hour revolving party. He never locks his front door and certainly never answers said door; if the doorbell rings, this proves that the person ringing it does not really know him. He steals his electricity and doesn't seem to have ever paid rent so the person ringing the bell is probably someone very angry.<br /><br />One of my favorites is Luther Driggers; a former pesticide employee who has managed to steal a poison so powerful that if added to the town's water supply would kill everyone. He lets it be widely known that he is unstable and as a result, the patrons and owners of the local diner watch him furtively as he eats his breakfast. If he just stares at his food, as he does when in a bad mood, and then leaves without eating the waitress hollers \\"Luther's not eating again\\" and everyone gets nervous.<br /><br />We can't forget Chablis, pronounced shablie, a singer and performer at a local club. She has a little secret she shares with the John Berendt soon after appointing as him as her personal chuffer. This is a good one! and I'll not soon forget how to turn fake pregnancies into cash! You'll understand after you read the book.<br /><br />These are only a few of the many characters you'll come to love. They all seem like that crazy neighbor that your scared of until one day you get to know him and find out he's just like the rest of the people on this planet; just trying to get by.<br /><br />I highly recommend this fun and just plain crazy book, especially for a work of non-fiction.	2005-09-21

If you've seen the size of some of his works, the System of the World trilogy spans almost 3000 pages, then you know what I mean. Six-hundred pages seem like a quick read by comparison, and it does go by quickly. <br /> <br />The incumbent president's platform for re-election is the negation of the national debt. A large conglomerate decides to use it's money to get someone into office that will not renege on the American Debts. This entity sees a perfect opportunity when William A. Cozzano has a stroke and thus opens up the possibility of a new procedure. Doctors implant a chip in his brain to replace lost nerve connections. However, who is now making his decisions?  <br /> <br />Part thriller, part political satire, this will keep you hooked wondering how it will all work out. <br /> <br />Oh, yeah; if you want a cheaper copy, just input \\"Interface\\" at the search for books menu and it should bring up an earlier edition printed in 1999. It is the same book under the pseudonym Steven Bury and can be had for about two dollars plus shipping. <br />	2005-09-21
