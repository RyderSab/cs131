Mr. Lange does a superb job of weaving a scientific theme into a fictional adventure.  Anne is an extremely accomplished scientist on the verge of completing her dream of developing a machine that can quickly and systematically erase points in the brain that cause psychotic episodes.  Through her exposure to the operation of the machine she unleashes something unplanned...a past that she did not know she had.  As the story unfolds you are drawn into two worlds, Russian in the 1430s and a parallel life set in the modern day.  The suspense level and intrigue are thoroughly enjoyable.  I look forward to more of Mr. Lange's work.	2005-06-12
US	50518636	R31NRPX4WLTPCG	1594480001	659516630	The Kite Runner	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A modern day fable	Amir and Hassan are wonderful boyhood friends even though their culture dictates that one is a servant and one is the son of an affluent and well respected business man.  Amir's story is that of a boy who is uncertain of his worth and sometimes he lashes out at his best friend because of this insecurity.  Amir struggles with finding a balance between being Hassan's friend and being his \\"superior\\".  Hassan is everything Amir feels he is not- loyal, strong, and brave.  The Kite flying tournament is the pinnacle of young Amir's life- a chance for him to win his father's attention.  Instead it becomes a defining moment of failure for him as he chooses self preservation over helping his best friend.  This sense of failure spirals to despair and causes Amir to make decisions that destroy the home he and Hassan have shared.  Ultimately he will be called back to make amends with Hassan after he has grown.  He will be forced to become all those things he has not been- loyal, strong, and brave.<br /><br />Afghanistan came alive for me while reading this novel.  Hosseini vividly depicts a place that is more than just a distant country that had a repressive regime.  This novel gave me a better understanding for the Afghan way of life and it's recent history.	2005-01-28

Each theme includes activities that might be categorized as arts and crafts or experiments in addition to more traditional language art/literacy building activities.  The activities are pretty creative in general.  An explanation for the parents is written at the beginning of each unit so we can understand exactly what the  we're trying to accomplish.<br /><br />The activities for the most part are in line with what my kindergartener is doing at school although I think some of them could easily be started with a precocious preschooler who is showing interest in letters, sounds and reading.	2005-01-24

One of the beauties of this story was Ms. Niffenegger's adeptness at keeping the chronological events straight from each charachter's perspective.  Henry is a time traveller, not by choice but by genetics.  Clare first meets him when she is 6.  She learns enough about him from the future that finally meeting him in the present is a wonderful, rapturous event she has waited for her whole life.  He, as his present self, has no idea who she could be.<br /><br />The illusion is not broken as Clare and Henry find they have some secrets they must keep from each other and for Henry even from his past self so that fate can play out it's hand.  Henry and Clare's story is real, sweet, sad, and joyful just like life can be.  It is a wonderful story of an enduring and undying love coupled with real life problems and the problems of time travel.	2005-01-23

Much like the charachter Drawlight I was getting rather anxious about whether Mr. Norrell would ever perform magic or if this book would just be an unending ciruit of overly hyped parties with the uppercrust of 1810 in attendance.  Around page 200 events unfolded that proved this book worth the effort.  And the story actually became a \\"stay up late to see what is going to happen next\\" during the last 200 pages.  Mr. Norrel is boring, overly cautious, and reclusive- not your normal hero.  Jonathan Strange is daring, charasmatic, and sometimes oblivious to events around him.  You respect what both men bring to the rebirth of English magic in the end.  A sequel would be embraced- perhaps \\"Strange and Norrell escape from the unending darkness\\"?  Or \\"The Fall of the Nameless slave\\" or \\"Vinculus: the New Book\\"....	2005-01-14

Instead of Roosevelt being re-elected for a third term Charles Lindbergh becomes president.  Under Lindbergh's administration the US does not enter into World War 2 and in fact signs treaties with Hitler to remain nuetral during Hitlers quest to take over Europe.  The \\"nuetrality\\" subtly begins to change the views of US citizens with anti-semitic sentiment seeming to predominant in the American public.  A family that once felt safe as part of a country that was tolerant of differences now begins to fear for their safety.<br /><br />It's an interesting exploration of how subtle changes begin to make big impacts on a culture.  The story is well thought out and written leaving you with a feeling that it could have easily happened.	2005-01-02

Imagine their surprise at finding a \\"kids book\\" among all those with just words. Opus has been read every night since.  And the message of this wonderful story has not been lost.  Although we've had to discuss why Opus is okay with not getting his own set of wings that work, I think the message of being happy with and making the most of the gifts you already have has been recorded somewhere in their little brains.<br /><br />Anyway- Opus stands the test of time.  If you grown ups have it tucked away somewhere gathering dust get this book out and share Opus with someone newer to this world.  And have a Merry Christmas!	2004-12-22

As usual he takes on a somewhat controversial scientific topic and explores the issues through story.<br /><br />Peter Evans starts out as a surprisingly (...) charachter.  I can't recall any lead in one of Crichton's books being quite this much of a whiner- or at least they were a secondary charachter and quickly eaten by a T-Rex or a velociraptor much to the readers relief usually.  This charachter goes through a little more personality development through his movement towards enlightenment.  Whether you agree with his final views or not there is the standard adventurous twists and turns and he grows into a reasonably respectable main charachter.  Of course I am not sure any 3 dimensional human being could withstand the physical punishment that Evans endures over the course of a few short days.  And Crichton is a bit more graphic than usual- especially during the cannibal scene.<br /><br />Some people will be undoubtedly upset by the views expressed in this novel.  But it is worth reading as it applies to the human condition overall regardless as to whether or not you believe in the data that is quoted.  The State of Fear message is similiar to one of the messages in the recent Michael Moore movie \\"Bowling for Columbine\\".  Both point to the idea that we as a society are governed by things we are made to believe threaten us.  It's an interesting concept to ponder.	2004-12-19

Codell's writing is inspiring as well as informative.  She provides tons and tons of ideas for reading materials on all manners of topics from social studies to bath time.  But she doesn't stop there!  She also includes clever ideas to make reading come to life for kids.  As an avid lover of resource and child education books, I admit I only own few but this one is a keeper.  I would recommend this for parents of infants through early elementary students.  If you are looking for reading material to augment your child's life experiences or classroom experiences, I believe this book would be a valuable asset.  Happy Reading!	2004-06-24

This is a great story for any child who has an interest in bones, doctors, hospitals, the human body etc.  The illustrations are cute.  The story is of a little girl, Jessica, who has broken her arm.  As she is receiving care at the hospital, she sees all different types of x-rays and the different types of equipment that take them.  The best part of all is that there are real X-rays on every other page for kids to study up close.  My preschoolers really enjoyed spending some time looking over those pages.  It's a very unique book.  I would highly recommend it for the budding scientist or for any child who may have to have X-rays of their own taken.	2003-12-11

The writers have taken a simple format to clearly illustrate their points without getting long winded. It provides a variety of checklists from basic knowledge of adjectives to making sure the child knows his or her name, address, etc. There are several sections with tips on how to build your child's self confidence to help him or her be more secure with the transition to school.<br />While the book is short, it gives some of the same advice as much lengthier titles.  It even provides some ideas in what to look for in clothing etc for those first few weeks of school.  It helped me identify several areas that I could introduce to my kids to help get ready for school.	2003-08-05

This book is a great introduction to the concept that air is a real thing even though it can't be seen.  It has easy experiments that anyone could do at home. The illustrations give life to the experiments and the information.  The story does an excellent job of introducing the idea of air as a real thing even though kids can't see it. It touches on the science of molecules. I would recommend this book for preschool clear through elementary.  It would be a great starting off point for discussing gases and I would consider it a very early flirtation with chemistry.	2003-06-23

But on his way home, he meets all kinds of animals who need help.  Through his acts of kindness, George becomes less and less spiffy. This a story that introduces the concept of putting others' needs before your own in a cute humorous way.  The illustrations are as clever as they are expressive.  My four and two year old request this story almost daily.	2003-05-17

I am using this book to help introduce preschool math concepts to my two at home.  It has great ideas that are easily adaptable so that you can use items around the house. The authors provide lots of activities that help introduce concepts like patterning, one to one correspondance, addition and subtraction through play.  They also provide a list of what to look for as the child plays and questions to get the child thinking about math.  This is the best preschool math resource I have found thus far.  Just reading through it helps provide the frame of mind to recognize opportunities to teach math to this age group.  I am extremely pleased!	2003-04-10

The activities are grouped into sections based on what skill or topic they most relate to (ie fine motor skills, large motor skills, developing an interest in science, language skills, critical thinking).  Each section is loaded with hands on active learning activities geared for preschoolers. Most of the supplies needed are items you will have around the house and are about ready to pitch.  My personal favorite is the \\"Is the cup full\\" experiment.  I use these with my kids at home.  There are some activities that are geared for larger groups but most can be done individually.

She spends a lot of time on how to approach writing.  She gently points out that it is not initially a fine motor skill to be mastered but an avenue for the child to record his or her own stories and experiences.  Her constant message is how to encourage rather than perfect the child's ability which is refreshing in a world of standardize testing.  Through sharing of her own experiences she provides ideas on how to help further develop a child's natural inventiveness into lessons on reading, writing, science and math.  This is not a hard line method to expose a child to everything available but rather an encouragement based approach to explore ideas with your child.	2003-03-16

It is about a little penguin who is about to be a big brother but who is responsible for delivering packages all over the frosty north.  All the deliveries are items that mothers are using to take care of their babies.  By the end the little Penguin has decided he is ready for his baby brother's egg to hatch.  There is no connection that he has learned that taking care of a baby takes a lot of work.  If you are looking for a book to introduce big brothers or big sisters to the arrival of a baby this would not be my first recommendation.  If you want to introduce the mail system it is pretty decent at describing package delivery.	2002-12-16

It really helped me take a step back from what was becoming a very negative, constantly yelling, stressful relationship and move towards making it positive and enjoyable. The ideas discussed are not about new ways to punish but methods to use to teach your child self discipline and stress management.

In this work she leads you through the maze of a serial killer's mind as he closes in on his prize victim.  Another &quot;can't put it down&quot; book by Gerritsen that I would strongly recommend.	2001-12-31

Not only are there tips for how to save cash, there are also lots of ideas for recycling tons of household items.

I have read most of her works and they are gripping, &quot;can't put it down&quot; books.  Gravity is a great sci fi story about an experiment on board the space station that goes awry.	2001-11-27

It is great music for little ones who have lots of energy and love to dance.  If you are a parent who enjoys this genre and can't handle another &quot;kid's&quot; album this is a great alternative. It includes some dance step instructions but we have fun just dancing on our own.	2001-08-21
