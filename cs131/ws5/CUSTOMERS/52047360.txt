First and more obviously, it serves as a neat introduction to the Wagner Ring Cycle for those unfamiliar with it. Second, it provides several interesting insights into the myth and its characters for those already \\"into\\" the operas.<br /><br />Runcie's style alternates between present-tense and past-tense 3rd-person narrative, free verse narrative when used as dialogue in several cases, and passages in a larger print used (I believe)as a sort of stream of consciousness. I found the latter format a little distracting.<br /><br />Runcie's prose keeps things moving at a nice clip. Each of his 11 chapters deal with the point of view of a single character, starting with Alberich and ending with an epilogue about Wotan. I especially liked the bit in which Wotan considers Alberich's good points, none of which are apprarent in the operas.<br /><br />There are three appendices dealing the sources of Ring Cycle, the operas, and the philosophy behind them. Runcie also provides some useful notes at the back of the book as well as some good links to websites about the myth and Wagner.<br /><br />In general, I found this interesting reading and will get back to it again when I prepare for my next hearing about the Ring Cycle on CDs and DVDs.	2005-09-21

My question exactly when I saw a copy of Bruce Vermazen's \\"That Moaning Saxophone: the Six Brown Brothers and the Dawning of a Musical Craze\\" (Oxford, 2004). I gave it a try and found it fascinating reading.<br /><br /> Of course, I am most interested in the history of American music. And while the actual story of a certain Saxophone sextet act is not in itself totally engrossing, their story is the story of all vaudeville acts that had their glory days and finally were squeezed out of existence by something called the motion picture. Indeed, the final chapters almost brought a tear to the eye as the Brown Brothers (well, not exactly the original six by any means but the act that went under that name) found the market for their incredible talents become more and more restricted as they had to share billing with films because so many of the old vaudeville houses had converted to movie theaters.The summary of the book on this website provides you with many details covered by the author, so let that suffice.<br /><br />  The 214 pages of text are followed by many more of notes, discography, and two indexes. A must read for anyone interested in the never really Good Old Days of live performers who could not survive the march of science in its most commercial aspects.	2004-09-26

But now a similar set has been released for a younger audience, \\"The Story of Classical Music\\" (NA331012). The text is by Darren Henley and it is read engagingly by conductor Marin Alsop.<br /><br /> It uses some 150 musical examples and a good deal of silly sound effects like J.S.Bach walking over 200 miles to hear an organ or (more distastefully) a comic chop of the ax when thus and so were beheaded. But the music is well chosen-albeit too few examples are used for major composers-from the bottomless Naxos catalogue; and it covers the centuries from Gregorian chant right up to the film music for \\"Gladiator\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings.\\"<br /><br /> It is hard to say what age group is the target audience of this set; but I think many adults who know little or nothing about the world's greatest music and the men who created it (alas, women composers were simply too few and/or unrecognized to get into anthologies like this one) will appreciate this approach. It does not dumb things down (except for those sound effects) and even I learned a thing or two about some of my favorite pieces.<br /><br /> Best of all is a slew of CD-ROM features on the last disc that provide extra information and pictures about the composers, the instruments of the classical orchestra, national anthems and flags, scores, the text of the CDs, musical terms, and several more. Please consider this as a thoughtful gift to an interested youngster-or to one who just might become interested. Good work	2004-08-28

I noticed in the Radio Spirits catalogue a book called \\"This Was Radio,\\" became interested, got a copy, and was favorably impressed enough to want to tell you about it.<br /> Measuring about 14 1/4\\" long and 11 1/4\\" high, this attractive volume of only 57 pages (plus an index) gives a very nice introduction to what radio was all about in the pre-television days and provides plenty of pictures to let you know what the stars looked like. Now the important word is \\"introduction.\\" I must make it clear that you will have to turn to other books for fuller details; but author Ronald Lackmann does what he set out to do very well. He gives you an outline, not a full history, of that phenomenon that was part of so many lives in my generation.<br /> The contents are divided like this. Chapter 1: The Beginning, 2: Mystery, adventure, horror, suspense, westerns, 3: Comedy, 4: Music programs, 5: Popular children's programming, 6: Daytime programming for the ladies, 7: Panel, quiz and talk shows, 8: Radio news brings World War II home, 9: Unforgettable radio moments, 10: The golden age of radio lives on.<br /> Just as important are the two CDs that accompany the text, letting you hear the actual sounds of many of the programs mentioned in the text and many important moments from our history such as the Hindenburg disaster and Churchill's \\"Finest Hour\\" speech. Among the less important but still memorable selections are the sketch that got Mae West banned from radio and the voices of Marilyn Monroe and Marlin Brando.<br /> But I must register a strong reprimand to whoever gave the first CD only two tracks and the second one only four. So while the book gives a complete list of the selections on the discs, you would have a very hard time locating any given one of them-which makes their classroom value nearly nil. Perhaps this can be remedied (although I doubt it) and replacement CDs sent to purchasers.<br /> Nevertheless, the discs are fine if you play them straight through; and the text and pictures are well worth the price.doubt it) and replacement CDs sent to purchasers.<br /> Nevertheless, the discs are fine if you play them straight through; and the text and pictures are well worth the price.	2004-05-31

Remember all those sex manuals that suddenly proliferated: The Sensuous This and That, Where to Pick Up Men/Women and What To Do With Them Later? Well, back around the first century CE a chap named Ovid had anticipated them all with his \\"Art of Love.\\" And that was literally in the Year 1.<br /> Augustus, head of  one of the most corrupt empires ever, went on a morality kick, had the book banned, and sent Ovid into exile. In fact, the United States also tried to keep the book out of this country up to 1960. And now in 2004 you can hear it read with perfect enunciation and seriousness by Martin Jarvis on two Audio Partners tapes (21050).<br /> The first part is addressed to the men, the second (to keep things fair, Ovid explains) to the women. Now many people confuse his purpose just as they do that of Machiavelli in \\"The Prince.\\" Neither man is advocating what he writes as a way of life. He is merely describing how humans have always acted and saying that if you wish to do these things, you might as well do them right. (I know some will disagree with me when it comes to Ovid, but to each his own opinion.)<br /> Using metaphors drawn from chariot racing, navigating, and mythical tales, Ovid describes in great details where to meet the opposite sex, how to attract them, how to keep them interested when out of bed, and how to act when in bed. Yes, being a man, he tends to be very patronizing when discussing female reactions in the men's section; but he is quite sympathetic to women when addressing them in the second section.<br /> Definitely not to be used for junior high school book reports, this reading will not only amuse you and surprise you (my gosh, it's so modern!) but perhaps also give you a deeper insight from a man who did it all about 2000 years ago.all about 2000 years ago.	2004-03-04

They have all been written and narrated by Jeremy Siepmann with the assistance of actors such as David Timson. To this impressive series we can now add \\"Joseph Haydn\\" (8.558091-94) on four CDs with a running time of 4 1/2 hours.<br /> The running theme throughout this audiobiography is Haydn's marvelous sense of humor. This trait can be spotted from his music alone, but it is good to hear all the wonderful anecdotes concerning it that fill this recording. Musicians will be impressed by Haydn's loyalty to his players and the remarkable tact he showed in swaying his \\"serene highness\\" bosses to his way of thinking.<br /> The recorded text is supported by many musical examples drawn from the deep pool of Naxos recordings. As with other entries in these series, I feel that some of them are a bit too long; but after all, the title of the series is Life and WORKS. David Timson is the voice of Haydn, and he is supported by actors Sam Dastor, Nigel Anthony, Steve Hodson, Roger May, and Frances Jeater.<br /><br /> As always with these Naxos sets, the booklet alone is worth the price you pay for the whole product. Its 146 pages include eight sections: Track lists, cast, historical  background, Haydn in his time, his major works and their significance, a graded reading plan, recommended reading, personalities, a calendar of Haydn's life, a glossary, and advice on how to use the CD-ROM feature of these discs.<br /> Highly recommended, as is the entire series.	2004-01-31

Never shy of surprises, Naxos now gives us what I hope is the start of a new series, A Life in Words and Music. \\"Enrico Caruso\\" is now available on a 4-CD boxed set (8.558131-34) with a text and narration by British actor David Timson (the voice of the composers in the other series) and 30 original Caruso recordings to support and illuminate the text.<br /> Caruso was a fascinating personality, prone to human weaknesses but seldom losing his sense of humor. Timson gives us all the pertinent facts about his incredible rise to stardom, his domestic problems, the Monkey House scandal, even the Black Hand's threats on his life, his continuing battle with throat problems. Unlike some other opera stars, he is a thoroughly lovable character and I found myself really getting to like and admire him as the story of his life spun out on these wonderful CDs.<br /> By the way, each of the 30 recordings, dating from 1902 to 1920 (how sad he missed the age of electric recordings,) is played complete; so having this set can even be the start of a collection of all his recordings, all of which are available in 12 volumes in the Naxos Historical series.<br /> The tracking list in the booklet can send you to any point in Caruso's career or to any one of the 30 recordings. All in all, a very worthwhile package from Naxos.	2004-01-31

I needn't have wondered! Reading it cover to cover has been one of the more pleasant tasks I have encountered as a reviewer.<br /> This Oxford University Press book retails for $30. Edited by Robert Wyatt and John Andrew Johnson, it is organized into eight sections: Portraits of the Artist, The Growing Limelight (1919-1924), Fame and Fortune (1924-1930), Maturity (1930-1935, Porgy and Bess, Last Years: Hollywood (1936-1937), Obituaries and Eulogies, and As Time Passes. There are 83 reading selections in all. Some are contemporary reports, essays, letters, biographies; some are backward looks written since the composer's death.<br /> In short, this can be used as a sourcebook for those studying various aspects of Gershwin's life and works (practically the same things) or read for pure enjoyment. My favorite anecdote that so wonderfully reveals the innocent egotism of GG is the story told on pp. 181-182 about a remark he made to composer Harry Ruby and his reaction to being reminded of it two years later. Priceless.<br /> Each selection is introduced by the editors, who give background information about what is to be discussed and the persons involved. There is no dearth of negative criticism about GG's \\"classical\\" compositions; and they have even included one which states that Gershwin could not have written the music attributed to him. (The implication is that no Jewish composer could have done that well, a strong echo of Wagner's identical claim, and then contradicted by the writer's claiming the music is bad anyway!)<br /> This OUP book is the very model of what a \\"reader\\" should be-and teachers and students of the history of American music, I will be making great use of the information therein.<br /> Need I add, Highly Recommended?	2004-01-26

In 1985, Helen Hayes played a very American Miss Marple in &quot;Murder With Mirrors.&quot; Of course, better known is the Joan Hickson version that appeared in the USA on Mystery Theatre. Now that same Ms. Hickson reads the original version on a 4-audio cassette boxed set from Audio Partners with the British title &quot;They Do It With Mirrors.&quot;<br /> The plot revolves around a home for juvenile delinquents set up by Lewis Serrocold who is married to Carrie Louise, an old school chum of Marple's. The relationships are a bit hard to sort out when one is hearing a tape and cannot turn back a few pages to see who is who, but things get moving when three shots ring out, two behind a closed door and one far off. Murder (but for what reason?), attempted murder (but was it really?), and a little stab at slow poisoning (if that is what it was) complicate things. But by drawing her usual analogies between those concerned and those whom Marple knew long ago, she is able to hit upon the solution.<br /> Unfortunately, I feel this is not one of Christie's better plots--which still makes it a fairly good one!--but the title more or less gives the solution away. I also find that Hickson's voice, so perfect for Marple, is not as flexible as those of other readers in this series and she makes no attempt to act out the various parts. Now and then, but not very often, she does grow a tad hard to understand for a word or two. Still, it makes great listening on long trips or just sitting there on a cold winter's night with a mug of hot something and a good book on the tape deck.	2003-09-23

Rutherford shared a scene or two with another character actress named Joan Hickson, who was to play Miss Marple in a series of television mysteries that were far more faithful to their originals than were the films. So if you have already seen the two dramatic treatments of &quot;4:50 From Paddington&quot; or (as it was called over here) &quot;What Mrs. McGillicuddy Saw&quot; and love comparisons, you might want to make a triple one with what Christie actually wrote by either reading the book itself or hearing an authoritative reading of it by Joan Hickson herself on an Audio Partners set on 5 audio cassettes or on 6 CDs.<br /> In a houseful of potential murderers, the very interesting Christie character named Lucy Eyelesbarrow takes a position in order to find the body. As one commentator mentions, she is Christie's strongest independent woman to date and possibly in all of the mysteries. So where Rutherford simply was given a fatter role, the original story is that of Lucy with some fancy brainwork by Miss Marple, of course.<br /> A very good entry in Audio Partners readings.	2003-09-23

Actually I should have said 1.5 cassettes since Naxos decided to keep each of the three acts on a single side, leaving the second side of the second tape simply blank.<br /> Although much of the fun comes from the sight gags of things floating in the air and characters on stage being unable to see the ghost(s), enough of the situation comes across in this well-produced recording. We have as the husband Colin Redgrave (a familiar face from many a Masterpiece Theatre), Kika Markham as the new wife Ruth, and Thelma Ruby as the bumbling but still authentic medium Madame Arcati.<br /> The unwelcome ghost Elvira is played by the lush-voiced Joanna Lumley, best known today as the never quite sober Patsy on &quot;Absolutely Fabulous&quot; and best known several years ago as the battling Purdy on &quot;The New Avengers.&quot;<br /> A very funny play done to perfection and even funnier with recordings of the author himself singing some of his lyrics between the scenes. The last one is especially appropriate, so look for it.	2003-09-06

(1943) to 'Fiddler on the Roof' (1964)&quot; by Steven Suskin, a man who worked in showbiz and knew it well from the inside. The wonderful things about this book were his quoting from the six major theatre reviewers of that era, his own comments, and statistics about things pertaining to productions and reviews. Seven years later, there followed &quot;More Opening Nights on Broadway: A Critical Quotebook of the Musical Theatre, 1965-1981,&quot; which followed the same winning format.<br /> All this is to explain why I pounced when I saw that Oxford University Press had in its current catalogue &quot;Broadway Yearbook 2000-2001&quot; and &quot;Broadway Yearbook 2001-2002,&quot; the second of which is described as &quot;A Relevant and Irreverent Record.&quot; Here Mr. Suskin considers many the major Broadway shows within those seasons and gives us not what others say but thoughts and philosophies of his own relating to the madness that accompanies any new Broadway opening.<br /> Just to give you some idea of what is contained in the more recent volume, I will mention that he covers revivals of classics such as &quot;Hedda Gabler,&quot; &quot;Major Barbara&quot; and &quot;Dance of Death&quot;; revivals of musicals such as &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and the many &quot;Encore&quot; concert recreations at the City Center; one-woman shows such as those given by Barbara Cook (good), Bea Arthur (awful) and Elaine Stritch (fabulous); and new musicals such as &quot;Urinetown,&quot; &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (but far from it), and &quot;By Jeeves&quot; (a flop rewrite of a former flop).<br /> His comments are, as already described, relevant and irreverent, always amusing and informative, always thought-provoking. Even the Curtain Calls section at the end is quite good: honorable mentions to those who deserve credit for sundry contributions to the season, Tony winners, plays still running from the last season, shows that never reached town, long-run statistics, and obits of those who passed away during the season.<br />Very thorough, very thoughtful.<br /><br /> My only complaint is the use of those silly little quotes torn out of the text and highlighted in a bolder font that serve only to distract your attention from the main text. Perhaps that works for those who flip through magazines, but not for a serious book of this nature. Otherwise, well done and highly recommended.ite good: honorable mentions to those who deserve credit for sundry contributions to the season, Tony winners, plays still running from the last season, shows that never reached town, long-run statistics, and obits of those who passed away during the season.<BR>Very thorough, very thoughtful.<br /> <BR> My only complaint is the use of those silly little quotes torn out of the text and highlighted in a bolder font that serve only to distract your attention from the main text.

A sleeping couple is informed by an hysterical maid that there is a body in the library, a fact first the wife's and then her spouse's sleepy brain refuses to accept. Since neither of them have a clue who she is, we know we are off on a typically atypical Christie jaunt.<br /> The tongue-in-cheek feeling you will detect in the first chapters is utterly proven when a young lad includes Christie's own name in a list of mystery writers who sent him their autograph. Even the detective's inappropriate name, Inspector Slack, adds to the humor of this lovely little mystery.<br /> I notice that while the David Suchet television versions of the Poirot mysteries stray from the details of their sources, the Joan Hickson Miss Marple ones are fairly faithful. Therefore if you can get your hand on the HBO recording of this episode, you would probably enjoy reading the book first and then watching the video.<br /> Or perhaps better still, you can now hear the entire novel read on Audio Partner tapes or CDs by that stalwart British actress, Stephanie Cole, who is best known as the crusty Diana Trent in &quot;Waiting For God.&quot; Her deep voice can capture those of the male and female characters quite nicely; and while she does not go in for any grand displays of voice characterization (a problem when Christie does not identify the speaker during long exchanges), she is never less than arresting and a good choice for this sort of reading.<br /> The playing clocks in at 5 hours, 23 minutes.	2003-06-15

Late in the 1990s, Harper Row began to release on cassettes the Arkangel Complete Shakespeare, all of which I reviewed in one paper or another. Using some of the best of the young theatrical talent in Great Britain and some of the older established stars of stage and screen, the producers gave us readings of every single word of every single play by Shakespeare, including the seldom-performed &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot; which is partially by Shakespeare.<br /> Well, hold on! Audio Partners has been contracted to release the entire set on CDs. The trick is that you cannot purchase the individual sets but are required to purchase the entire package of 38 plays for $600. That is 98 CDs in all with a playing time of just over 101 hours! Libraries and school departments take note.<br /> Hearing them as they were released on tape in batches of four or five, I was impressed mostly with the enormity of the project but found some things to quibble about. Casting Oberon and Titania with a pair whose voices were South African or Jamaican (no Henry Higgins, I) made some sense in that it emphasized their other-worldly-ness. So did assigning Malvolio in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; to an actor with a distinct Scottish accent, but giving Mercutio in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; to the same actor was absurd. Then too there is that sudden sound effect of a train pulling out of a station in the middle of &quot;All's Well That Ends Well&quot;! Granted there was a production current then that did place the play in more modern times, but when one is hearing a recording with no clue as to setting, the result was jarring and should have been omitted.<br /> In the grander roles such as Hamlet, Othello and the like, the younger actors give modern readings which might strike some as slighting demands of the high poetry. And those who long for the grander readings can turn to the re-releases of the old Shakespeare Recording Society sets.<br /> One great disadvantage to the cassettes is that you could locate a specific scene only with much fast forwarding. With CDs, of course, you can jump to any scene by pressing the Skip button on your player. When a scene continues onto another disc, the tracking list tells you at which line the scene picks up.<br />The price might be prohibitive to all but an institution--but I feel that every library should find its way to purchasing the complete set in much the same way that many purchased the complete set of BBC Shakespeare videos.Shakespeare Recording Society sets. <br /> One great disadvantage to the cassettes is that you could locate a specific scene only with much fast forwarding.

Wodehouse. For those who spend too much time driving to read actual books, many of them are now on audio tape under the Audio Partners label and the latest of them is &quot;Jeeves and the Mating Season&quot; (61318), complete and unabridged. (Is that last phrase a tautology?)<br /> I have reviewed so many of these Jeeves books that I can only say they take place in a mythical time between the world wars when featherbrains like Bertie Wooster cannot survive without clever man servants like his Jeeves. Always intending the best and always creating the worst until Jeeves pulls him out of it, Bertie tries very hard to live up to the Code of the Woosters, a long list of chivalric ideals, one of which is that if a woman is convinced you want to marry her, marry her you must. So to avoid walking down the aisle with the most bubbleheaded female of them all, Bertie must make sure her present affianced does not desert to the camp of a glamorous actress. And so on.<br /> To reveal more details can only diminish your enjoyment of this romp, but I can give the basic situation. Gussie Fink Nottle (lover of newts) is engaged to Madeline Bassett but falls into the clutches of Corky Pirbright who is engaged to Esmond Haddock (a man dominated by aunts) and whose dog has bitten Constable Dobbs who is in love with the maid and daughter of Jeeves' Uncle Charley who....

Again, I leave it to you to sort out.And always remember, it is not only the funny situations in the Jeeves novels but Bertie's (that is Wodehouse's) funny way in which they are told.

Yes, Wodehouse does repeat himself, but I look upon it as ringing the changes. A line of bells is a line of bells, but their various combinations are what make things interesting.<br /><br /> Again Bertie is trying to avoid both marriage and having his spine broken in an increasing number of places, again having to purloin a valuable object to help out his only likable aunt, again depending on Jeeves first, middle, and last to extricate himself from dilemmas of his own doing and (at least in this book) those of others. Of the four actors assigned to read these novels and short stories on Audio Partners tapes, I think Jonathan Cecil is the best. He gives Wooster just that goofy intonation and all the other characters their due, making this set of four audio tapes a real humdinger. I have grown to realize that it is not so much that Wodehouse says funny things as that he says ordinary things in a funny way. That is why almost all of the Jeeves adventures are narrated first person by Wooster himself.<br /> Just the ticket to cheer one up after a hard day or during a long boring drive.<br /> As a PS, there is a very good life of Wodehouse by David A. Jasen put out by Schirmer Trade Books, &quot;P.G. Wodehouse: A Portrait of a Master.&quot; It makes an easy read and brings you closer to the creator of the dreamworld in which lives the Woosters and the rest.	2003-03-30

Even merely the operas of Mozart cannot be adequately handled in a single volume (let alone the number of recordings involved). So on a much more modest scale, we have Andrew Steptoe's &quot;The Mozart-Da Ponte Operas&quot; from the Clarendon Paperbacks division of Oxford University Press (1988, reprinted 2001).<br /> For those wondering about that title, Lorenzo Da Ponte was the fascinating character who wrote the libretti to three of Mozart's greatest operas. In fact, the subtitle of this book is &quot;The Cultural and Musical Background to 'Le Nozze di Figaro,' 'Don Giovanni,' and 'Cosi fan tutte,' but the book does not even get to those works until page 98. Roughly the first third of the book gives us an excellently organized and clear background to the works and the chapter titles will tell you exactly what I mean: &quot;The Social Context: Vienna and Her Ruler,&quot; &quot;Musicians, Audience, and Opera in Mozart's Time,&quot; &quot;Mozart and Vienna,&quot; and &quot;Mozart and His Personal Circle.&quot; The next chapter deals with Da Ponte and the opera buffa tradition, and we finally have what we need to understand more fully what Mozart's audiences saw in these works that are all but lost to us.<br /> The sixth chapter talks about &quot;Cosi fan tutte&quot; and how it reflected the moral climate of the day, while the next one discusses how Mozart treated the buffa plot from the musical standpoint. The remaining three chapters handle each of the Mozart-Da Ponte collaborations, and there are detailed synopses of the works in the appendix.<br /> Although I have read most of this material before, I have never seen it put in so well-organized a fashion; and my next move is to reread it, putting margin notes in along the way. I plan to make much use of this book in my opera seminars, and the general reader (who will need some rudimentary knowledge of music to understand at least parts of this book) will find in it many a key to a deeper understanding of these three masterworks.l need some rudimentary knowledge of music to understand at least parts of this book) will find in it many a key to a deeper understanding of these three masterworks.	2003-03-25

So I really looked forward to reading &quot;The Cambridge Companion to The Musical&quot; (Cambridge University Press, 2002). When I saw there were only 265 pages of text (not counting bibliography and index), I doubted that they could adequately cover the field. Soon I began to realize that the &quot;field&quot; included American and British musicals, film musicals and film versions of stage musicals, and even recordings; and I just settled down to enjoy what amounts to a series of essays covering all these fields, none of them adequately but all of them interestingly.<br /> There are fourteen chapters by various writers, organized into three parts. The first deals with &quot;Adaptations and transformations before 1940&quot; and includes essays on the early days of the American musical theatre in general, then in New York, operetta on both sides of the Atlantic, the Afro-American as depicted on stage, and the American musicals of the 1920s and 1930s. Part II covers the years from 1940 to 1970 and discusses the British theatre, Rodgers and Hammerstein, their successors, and Weill and Bernstein. Part III picks up the story with a disproportionately long chapter on Sondheim, the fully integrated musical, the film musical, rock, and the megamusical--which brings us into the present century with a lot of questions yet to be answered by way of projection.<br /> In short, there are plenty of ideas packed into this short book and each one can lead you in several directions if you wish to follow up this or that idea. There are one or two piddling errors, such as calling &quot;Yip Yip Yaphank&quot; an &quot;all-sailor vaudeville&quot;; but in general what is said here is trustworthy, the opinions (mostly positive) about certain works and composers are informed opinions, the organization is very good. The few pictures, however, are not very helpful.<br /> Yes, I would recommend this highly for those who want to begin to understand the complex evolution of the musical play by way of enough examples to form a solid basis before going on to books that deal with each of these topics in more detailed and expanded way.mmend this highly for those who want to begin to understand the complex evolution of the musical play by way of enough examples to form a solid basis before going on to books that deal with each of these topics in more detailed and expanded way.	2003-03-24

It is very instructive, especially to film majors, to compare the originals with the scripts.<br /> For example, the most recent Poirot collection appears on four CDs in Audio Partners set 45284, which includes Nigel Hawthorne reading &quot;Murder in the Mews&quot; and Hugh Fraser (the Hastings of the television series) reading &quot;Triangle at Rhodes&quot; and &quot;The Incredible Theft.&quot; All of these are available on Acorn Media sets, should you wish to follow my&quot; hear-watch-compare&quot; suggestion.<br /> The plot of &quot;Triangle at Rhodes&quot; is very similar to that of &quot;Evil Under the Sun,&quot; which has been twice filmed, once as part of the Suchet series and once as a film with Peter Ustinov as the sleuth. So here you have a fabulous chance for a triple comparison.<br /> Both actors take on all the roles, as a reader must do, neither one quite catching the Poirot voice as well as Suchet has on the screen and in those tapes in which he does the readings. In fact, Hawthorne tends to make Chief Inspector Japp sound a little hostile; but both readers are quite good and carry the stories along with their enthusiasm.<br /> The CDs, by the way, are divided into tracks, so you can find your way back should you lose the setting from your last listening. Tapes, of course, stay where they left off.	2002-11-11

At the same time, Audio Partners has released a complete reading on 6 audio-tapes. &quot;Rumpole Rests His Case&quot; (61280) features actor Tony Britton and the six stories are as follows.<br /> &quot;Rumpole and the Old Familiar Faces&quot; (a fitting title for a &quot;return&quot; tale) concerns another inept robbery by a young member of the Timson clan, a Christmas pantomime, and an ex-con living it up as a gentleman.<br /> &quot;Rumple and the Remembrance of Things Past&quot; somehow and neatly manages to put a framing device of a non-smoking rule in &quot;chambers&quot; around a gruesome major plot of a wife's skeleton found buried in a floor.<br /> &quot;Rumpole and the Asylum Seekers&quot; is a timely tale of refugees escaping an oppressive government and those who make money by betraying them.<br /> &quot;Rumpole and the Camberwell Carrot&quot; is about a flaming affair between the lovely &quot;Portia of the Chambers&quot; and a noted pillar of morality who has more than just clay feet.<br /> &quot;Rumpole and the Actor Laddie&quot; is the shortest Rumpole story ever and the most unsatisfactory, revolving around a ring that might or not be stolen.<br /> &quot;Rumple and the Teenage Werewolf&quot; is another very timely tale about sexual stalking by e-mail. (Here I was sure I knew who the culprit was--it HAD to be!--and was wrong.)<br /> The final tale, &quot;Rumpole Rests His Case&quot; is the most unusual Rumpole story ever. After collapsing at the end of a particularly trying trial, Rumpole spends the story in a hospital bed in which he solves a crime and presents his case--to the other patients! A very touching finale.<br /> Britton lacks that Leo McKern blusteriness that Timothy West had on an earlier Audio Partners set of Rumpole tales, but he is quite good on his own terms. In general, the sparkle seems to have gone out of these Rumpole yarns; but any Rumpole is better than none. I therefore recommend this set without much reservation.sparkle seems to have gone out of these Rumpole yarns; but any Rumpole is better than none.

Here we have the usual tangle of contested unfair wills, dubious identities, attacks on a lovely lady who is then accused of murder herself, and all the while Ellery's keeping one step ahead of them all.<br /> Now you can hear one of the goofiest of them all for yourself on the Audio Partners audiotape edition of &quot;The Dragon's Teeth&quot; (61197), a complete reading by actor Blain Fairman, whose voice nicely matches the lightweight tone of the text. There are six cassettes with a running time of 8 hours, 14 minutes. I will not go into the plot, because most mystery fans want to come in fresh, but I have to explain that the title refers to the myth of Cadmus sowing the teeth of the dragon to raise fighting men. Since an important character is named Cadmus Cole, Ellery draws the parallel between the situations; but truth to tell, it is a weak one and plays no part in the solution. I thought I had pinpointed the real murder halfway through, but I was wrong! Well, that's what makes books like this one so much fun.	2002-10-04

In fact, HBO is reissuing all of the tapes onto DVD format and they will be available starting in in the Fall of 2002. So it was with great pleasure that I saw listed in the Audio Partners catalogue of books on tape, &quot;Rumpole on Trial&quot; ((61267). The set holds 6 cassettes with a running time of 8 hours and 7 minutes.<br /> The reader is British actor Timothy West, whose voice is the next best thing to the gravel-throated chortle of McKern. Here he reads seven complete Rumpole tales: &quot;Rumpole and the Children of Evil,&quot; &quot;...the Eternal Triangle,&quot; &quot;...the Miscarriage of Justice,&quot; &quot;...the Family Pride,&quot; &quot;...the Soothsayer,&quot; &quot;...the Reform of Joby Jonson,&quot; and (to break the pattern) &quot;Rumpole on Trial.&quot; All of these have been televised and all of them are a good deal of fun.<br /> John Mortimer's custom was to create around the case Rumpole is handling a framing plot that has thematic likenesses or is antithetical to the main plot. So, for instance, all the while Rumpole is worried about being disbarred, his draconian wife, Hilda (&quot;She Who Must Be Obeyed&quot; as he calls her) is plotting to have him made a judge.<br /><br />The army of minor characters are a joy in themselves. The pompous Head of Chambers &quot;Soapy&quot; Sam Ballard, the unhappily married clerk Henry, the pro-labor and pro-women barrister Liz Probert, the opera-loving snake in the grass Claude Erskine-Brown, the foot-in-his-mouth Guthrie Featherstone, and above all the (in)Justices Olliphant and Graves who love the prosecution and cannot see any humor in Rumpole's reminding them a trial should be fair.<br /><br />Timothy West does all the voices, of course, but does not try to emulate the women as other readers do on (say) the Jeeves tapes. That would have been an error, since the tales are always told first-person from Rumpole's point of view.<br />For the most part, I think I clocked in about one good laugh per minute while listening to these tapes on long car trips; and I can highly recommend this set.ther readers do on (say) the Jeeves tapes.

For a study of the social conditions behind Gilbert's satire, there is the long out of print &quot;The World of Gilbert and Sullivan&quot; by W.A. Darlington. For a fairly well balanced discussion of both the scripts and the music, there is &quot;Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Opera: a New Assessment&quot; by Audrey Williamson, which passed into a second edition when I saw it last. Then there is the indispensable single volume edition of  &quot;The Complete Annotated Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&quot; by Ian Bradley under the aegis of Oxford University Press.<br /> Now from that same august publisher comes a volume I might seriously consider as a fourth: &quot;A Most Ingenious Paradox&quot; by Gayden Wren. Having worked most of his life in the theatre and specializing in Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, Wren has come up with the thesis that &quot;Beneath the surface charm of the Savoy operas...lies a powerful thematic core that makes their works effective to this day&quot; (p. 4). Well, so it is with Shakespeare, Shaw, and even Rodgers &amp; Hart. It is the examples offered up by Wren that affords so much surprise and delight.<br />The book is organized into fairly self-contained chapters.The first deals with &quot;Gilbert before Sullivan,&quot; the second with &quot;Sullivan before Gilbert.&quot; Then we have a chapter for each of the 14 works, followed by a chapter about their careers after &quot;The Grand Duke&quot; and a final one about their &quot;Legacy.&quot; There follows an appendix with plot outlines, details about the original &quot;Ruddygore&quot; script and score, notes, an excellent critical bibliography, and index.<br /> I think that directors will appreciate the emphasis Wren puts upon the seriousness that underlies some of the works, and not only &quot;Yeomen of the Guard.&quot; For example, consider  the scene just before the finale between Iolanthe and the Lord Chancellor in which things do become &quot;life or death&quot; and which could easily lead to an unhappy ending with no violence to what has gone before. Of course, the public expected a happy ending with G&amp;S, but that was no reason they had to get one.<br /><br />His remarks about &quot;The Mikado,&quot; although confined to only 15 pages did make me suddenly aware of how Gilbert keeps tipping his hand all through by having the characters call attention to their being in a play: &quot;Japanese don't use pocket-handkerchiefs,&quot; &quot;the Japanese equivalent for Hear, hear, hear,&quot; &quot;Virtue is triumphant only in theatrical performances,&quot; and so on.  I part company on him with him on some remarks about &quot;Princess Ida,&quot; but his comparison between the opera and the Tennyson original is quite revealing. In general, I kept nodding and thinking about most of his conclusions with &quot;Of course, I should have realized that years ago.&quot;<br /> The style is friendly, the author taking it for granted, of course, that you know the plots of the operas fairly well to begin with. Yes, I think I might recommend this as the fourth essential book. But please give it a try and let me know what you think.<br /> A little postscript would be in order here. Naxos is reissuing at budget prices the old &quot;Martyn Green&quot; G&amp;S sets that used to be available on London and then Richmond mono LPs. Thus far they have added to their catalogue &quot;The Mikado,&quot; &quot;HMS Pinafore,&quot; &quot;Pirates of Penzance/Trial by Jury,&quot; and just this month &quot;The Gondoliers.&quot; Anyone intererested in the Wren book would certainly want to own these vintage recordings.xample, consider  the scene just before the finale between Iolanthe and the Lord Chancellor in which things do become &quot;life or death&quot; and which could easily lead to an unhappy ending with no violence to what has gone before.

Audio Partners, however,  has done the next best thing and  boiled it all down to 1 hour and 54 minutes with Derek Jacobi doing the honors with a small cast reading from the chronicles and other sources of the times.<br />Actually, it would help if you had a fairly good idea of English history to begin with and simply used this tape both as a refreshener and source of interesting extra details. Those plunging into the material cold will enjoy it but might easily get confused.<br /> This abridgment, written and produced by Richard Hampton and Davis Weston, makes a set of Monarch Notes (no pun intended) seem complete. But what facts are included are well chosen, often very funny (i.e., the size of George IV's stomach),and never less than fascinating. Jacobi is the perfect narrator with his faultless diction and (to say the least) flair for the dramatic. This set helped to shorten a very boring drive I had to take recently; and I think I will play it all again in the next few weeks just to catch anything I might have missed. A lot of fun from Audio Partners.	2002-05-29

If it is a superlative reading, then one would quote \\"Reason not the need\\" and accept it for a great addition to a swelling library of complete Shakespeare on recordings. We still have available on Caedmon audio tapes the 1965 \\"Lear\\" with Paul Scofield in the title role with Pamela Brown and Rachel Roberts as that particularly nasty pair of sisters, Goneril and Regan. 1988 brought out the BBC Audio Book (Modern Library) with Alec Guiness, Jill Bennett and Eilen Atkins in those roles. In 1994 there was a BBC Radio set with John Gielgud, Judi Dench and Eileen Atkins (again) in those three roles; while a late addition to the Arkangel Complete Shakespeare series gave us Trevor Peacock, Penny Downie and Samantha Bond, Peacock giving a more domestic, less grand reading of the role.<br /> Now Naxos Audiobooks has released on tape and CD yet another version with Paul Scofield again, Harriet Walter (Gonerill, as it is spelled on this set), Sara Kestelman (Regan), Emilia Fox (Cordelia), Peter Blythe (Albany), and Jack Klaff (Cornwall) as the dysfunctional royal family. As the parallel set, we have Alec McCowen (Gloucester), Richard McCabe (Edgar), and Toby Stephens (Edmond).<br /> While Kenneth Branagh played the villainous brother in the Gielgud set, he is assigned the Fool in this production with David Burke (Kent) and Matthew Morgan (Oswald).<br /> The reading in the Caedmon recording is in the grand manner, more poetical than is the most recent; but this Naxos effort seems to move faster, is more dramatic (as should be no surprise) in our sense of the word in that it is more realistic, more \\"modern\\" sounding. But I would not dismiss the older set by any means.<br /> I found Scofield less earth-shaking in this production, sounding a little more reasonable and vulnerable than in the earlier one--but after 36 years and under a new director (Howard Sackler in 1965, John Tydeman here), an actor must rethink the role. What I do appreciate is that every word in the storm scene is spoken clearly and not drowned out by the sound effects.<br /> All Drama departments should own both Scofield versions.

But passion and party blind our eyes, and the light which experience gives us is a lantern on the stern, which shines only on the waves behind us!&quot; --Samuel Taylor Coleridge<br /> Many people use the word &quot;propaganda&quot; in a blatantly pejorative sense. For those utterly convinced they  know the Truth, any counter argument is by definition wrong and therefore nothing but propaganda. It reminds me of an old World  War II film in which a GI is shocked to hear that the Germans consider him &quot;the enemy.&quot; After all, he reasoned, he was one of the Good Guys.<br /> Nevertheless, from the moment that news of Pearl Harbor came over the airwaves back on December 7, 1941, we were the Good Guys, those &quot;Nazis&quot; and those &quot;Japs&quot; were the Bad Guys; and the propaganda machines got rolling to reinforce that message in every possible way.<br /> For those who did not experience those days--and (alas) those years that followed December 7--one only has to think back to last September 11 to imagine how our United States reacted to the news over the radio and later in the papers and even later still at the movies where they could actually see the results of the &quot;day that will live in infamy.&quot; But history has this funny trick of repeating itself; and for a marvelous example of that fact, it would be a very good thing to get a copy of &quot;America at War&quot; from Radio Spirits.<br /> Here we have 20 tapes (there is also a CD version)of original broadcasts spanning the decade from12-7-41 to 4-4-49 that were designed to keep our hope up during the conflict and give us a positive view of things after it.<br />In the past, the sets from Radio Spirits that contain 20 tapes have given us 60 hours in all with 1.5 hours on each tape. There has also always been included a wonderfully prepared booklet with lots of illustrations and background information. Therefore I was a little surprised when &quot;America at War&quot; arrived with only an hour on each of the 20 tapes and no booklet at all. However, a few moments' consideration (and an e-mail inquiry to the publicity person) made things clear. The events of September 11 prompted the company to compile and release as soon as was possible this collection of shows related to World War II--and the message therein bears a frightful resemblance to what we are being told at present. Back then, however, there was a lot more poetry, purple prose, and (in short) style.<br />Among the many shows offered in this set are 7 Lux Radio Theatre dramatizations of then current war films: &quot;Wake Island,&quot; &quot;The War Against Mrs. Hadley,&quot; &quot;The Navy Comes Through,&quot; &quot;Air Force,&quot; &quot;So Proudly We Hail,&quot; &quot;Salute to the Marines,&quot; and &quot;Pride of the Marines.&quot; There are 2 from the &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot; series, 4 from &quot;Command Performance,&quot; and some miscellaneous dramatic presentations, two of which benefit greatly by the commanding voice of Orson Welles. From the great pool of &quot;team&quot; shows, there is only a &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; and a &quot;Vic and Sade.&quot;<br /><br />Some of the shows go a little too far for modern tastes in their highly poetic passages and idealized &quot;typical&quot; bits of Americana, no matter how sincere they might have been. Only in the opening &quot;Gulf Screen Guild Theatre&quot; episode and in one other is there even a hint that not everything is absolutely perfect in our country. However, it is the essential message is that our way was still the best in the world, mostly because of the great diversity of our population. I recommend you play tape 11, &quot;New York: a Tapestry for Radio&quot; as your first selection as a great example of what great cities were like (or people wished they were like) before the rage for hyphenated identifications began.<br /><br /> The last side ofthe 20th tape gives us the most important broadcasts of all: Roosevelt's &quot;Day of Infamy,&quot; John W. Vandercook's &quot;Announcing VE Day,&quot; &quot;Churchill's &quot;Blood, Tears,&quot; on-the-spot reactions to VE Day in New York and Los Angeles, &quot;Bob Trout's &quot;WWII is Over,&quot; and MacArthur's &quot;Japanese Surrender.&quot; There isn't a social studies teacher in this country that could not use this tape alone for a fantastic unit about life in those times.<br />The cover carries a warning that &quot;the content of these programs reflects certain racial and ethnic stereotypes that were prevalent during that era.&quot; I winced when a character playing a motorcyclist in one of the shows said that he passed &quot;a Jap&quot; and maybe he should have run him over! But that kind of moronic thinking has been repeated quite recently by those who are mindlessly advocating &quot;killing the whole bunch of them,&quot; meaning members of a certain religion.

However, when he was asked to assess Irving Berlin's place in American music, Kern replied that Berlin WAS American music. Not too long ago, the A&amp;E channel did two &quot;Classroom&quot; broadcasts about Berlin's life; and by a coincidence, several items concerning this prolific composer have recently come my way. I want to share one of them with you.<br /> It is a wonderful book from publisher Alfred A. Knopf titled &quot;The Complete Lyrics of Irving Berlin,&quot; edited by Robert Kimball and Linda Emmet (one of the composer's three daughters). Now, considering that this man wrote well over a thousand songs, that is quite a bit of material for a single volume. But this one measures roughly 11&quot; by 12&quot; and holds 530 pages, which hold three columns of text. In this way, we get the lyrics to 1,200 songs for which he wrote both words and the music (only a few early songs were set to words by others).<br /> The organization is chronological and intelligently packaged. Unlike Rodgers, Kern and Gershwin, Berlin wrote for Tin Pan Alley as well as for the stage. Therefore the editors have grouped the lyrics by &quot;Songs&quot; that were not intended for a specific show or film and by songs that were. So for 1914, for example, you will get all the independent songs composed that year in one chapter and those written for &quot;Watch Your Step&quot; the same year in a separate chapter. Even more welcome are the lyrics to many songs that were never published! It makes fascinating reading to surmise why these had to wait until this book came along to see the light of day.<br /> To make this book even more valuable, each song is given a little preface concerning copyright dates and other items of interest to the American musical historian. And you will love the full-page photographs that stand at the start of each chapter. There is also an introductory essay and a very useful chronology at the start of the book, while the index at the end can help you locate in the body of the book any song by title with no trouble. So while Berlin's lyrics might not be as clever as those of Cole Porter, Lorenz Hart or Ira Gershwin, many of them will bring back memories of how  Americans felt  almost from the start to the finish of the last century.<br /> (Take note. Knopf also has available similar tomes for the lyrics of Porter, Hart, and I. Gershwin. Each one is a definite Grabbit.k, while the index at the end can help you locate in the body of the book any song by title with no trouble.

Their boxed sets of tapes and CDs are devoted to a single show (Jack Benny) or a single star (Frank Sinatra) or to types of programs such as Science Fiction, Mystery, Westerns, comedy, Christmas shows. Some are based on a theme such as the recent &quot;America at War&quot; in which broadcasts of World War II were frighteningly like those on and just after 9/11/01. However, the beginner might turn to the most recent release: &quot;Old-Time Radio's 60 All-Time Favorites.&quot;<br /><br /> Available on 20 tapes with three shows each or on 30 CDs with two shows each, this collection includes several examples of just about every kind of radio show that kept us glued to that box when our imaginations supplied what the video tube was all too soon to give us--to our detriment.<br /> Without trying to list all 60 shows, here are some of those included in this set. For comedy we have Abbott &amp; Costello, Ozzie &amp; Harriet, Bob Hope, &quot;A Date With Judy,&quot; &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; ( a serious Easter episode), &quot;Life With Luigi,&quot; &quot;Our Miss Brooks,&quot; Fred Allen, Red Skelton, and Phil Harris and Alice Faye. It is interesting to note that the most popular of them all, &quot;Amos 'n' Andy,&quot; is not included, although separate collections of that hysterically funny show are available.<br /> You like hard-boiled detectives? Try Philip Marlowe, Nero Wolfe, Sam Spade, Boston Blackie, Richard Diamond, the Falcon, and Nick Carter. A little less hard-boiled are Casey, Crime Photographer, and Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons. For mystery with a spooky atmosphere, there are &quot;The Whistler,&quot; &quot;Suspense,&quot; &quot;Lights Out,&quot; and &quot;The Black Museum.&quot;<br /> Westerns are your meat? Then ride along with &quot;The Six Shooter,&quot; &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel,&quot; &quot;Gunsmoke,&quot; and &quot;Tales of the Texas Rangers.&quot; A little farther north you can hear &quot;Sergeant Preston of the Yukon&quot; getting his man across the snowy terrain.<br /> From the comic strips and the pulps come The Shadow, The Lone Ranger, and The Green Hornet. Science Fiction, their close relative, is represented by &quot;Dimension X&quot; and  &quot;X-Minus One,&quot; while dramatizations of then-current films (&quot;Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House&quot;) afford interesting comparisons as 90 to 120-minute stories have to be condensed into 25 minutes of radio time.<br /> Straight drama is abundant: &quot;Bold Venture&quot; (with Bogart and Bacall, no less), &quot;The First Nighter,&quot; &quot;Damon Runyon Theatre,&quot; and so on. And the only show that does not fit into any of the above is the fabulous &quot;Your Hit Parade,&quot; this one from 1943 with a certain up-comer by the name of Frank Sinatra to croon out the latest hits, including &quot;Speak Low&quot; and &quot;My Ideal.&quot;<br /> Adding extra spice to all of the above are the guest stars: Carmen Miranda, Joseph Cotten, Peter Lorrie, Cary Grant, among others. Then, of course, there are the stars themselves: Even Arden, Lucille Ball and Richard Denning, Marie Wilson, J. Carrol Nash, Joel McCrea--and I leave it to you to match those names with the shows in which they starred!<br /> Another bit of fun comes from the commercials--especially those that tell you how good cigarettes are for you--many of which, especially on the comedy shows, were integrated into the scripts. Of course, there will be several references to wartime shortages, rationing stamps, and other items that will need footnotes for younger listeners. All of which, by the way, suggests wonderful lessons a good Social Studies teacher could develop from judicious use of these tapes or CDs.<br /> As always, the book supplied by Radio Spirits is practically worth the price of the set alone. In 64 pages, it gives you a good deal of information about each show and has an illustration for almost allof them.of them.	2002-01-29

When the brother is found dead in his chair at the Club, the novel becomes, not a whodunit, but a &quot;whenwasitdun,&quot; a question much on the mind of not only the heirs of the two deceased persons but of Lord Peter Wimsey, who is asked by the brother's lawyer to help establish the time of the brother's death (that of the sister being certain).<br /><br /> The question of When is answered halfway through the novel. But even before that, the other questions of how he died and by whose hand become paramount; and Wimsey winds up offending almost everybody concerned in his inexorable quest for the solution. There is a certain tongue-in-cheek element in Sayers' writing that calls out for a good reading--and that is exactly what we get in the Audio Partner's set of 6 audio cassettes with none other than Lord Peter himself, which is to say Ian Carmichael, doing the honors.<br /> Having read the book twice in the past and watched the Acorn Media video release many times, I enjoyed listening to this tape even more, picturing in my mind the scenes from the television version, which seems to be remarkably faithful to the novel. This set is highly recommended for those who love a good mystery, well-told and (here) well read.	2002-01-13

Not only are several of the plot twists the same--this is a given in the Jeeves saga, since the events seem to happen chronologically and there are constant references to past events in other tales--but even Bertie has a case of deja-vu during some of the  repetitions. For example, the very female who had induced Bertie to burst a few hot water bottles in an earlier story is back again goading him on to other break-ins to find the very cow creamer that formed the nucleus of an earlier story. And like that. (By the way, the original title of this 1960 novel is &quot;Jeeves in the Offing.&quot;)<br /> Perhaps, also, my letdown was partially caused by the surprisingly straightforward reading of none other than Ian Carmichael, who actually played Bertie many decades ago on the telly. Unlike other readers of the Jeeves novels for Audio Partners, Carmichael does not assume the various voices; and a good deal of the fun is thereby diminished.<br /><br /> Now, please, understand that there is still a good deal of fun in this reading. I merely have to point out that the material and the reading suffer by comparison mostly and not altogether from any intrinsic defects. So let us give it 4 out of 5 stars, and still recommend it with only some reservations. There are 4 cassettes with a running time of 4 hours, 49 minutes.	2001-11-12

Sayers mystery titled &quot;The Nine Tailors&quot; is not about the garment industry. Instead it centers on the venerable tradition of &quot;change ringing&quot; still practiced in England in which a given number of church bells or &quot;tellers&quot; are rung in every possible combination. So nine of them would have to be rung in (what we call in math class) &quot;9 factorial&quot; or 362,880 different combinations. You can figure out how long that would take at one peal per second.<br /> Well the combinations do play a part in the solution of a particularly involved plot concerning jewelry stolen considerably in the past, a freshly dug grave with the wrong body in it, a flood, a snowstorm, and a villageful of really interesting characters, one of whom might be a thief, another a murderer, and so on. However, I am not reviewing the book itself but a marvelously effective complete reading of it by Lord Peter Wimsey himself, which is to say character actor Ian Carmichael who played Wimsey so well on the television series (now available on both VHS and DVD from Acorn Media). Here is the novel, complete on 6 cassettes, from Audio Partners, which is increasing their catalogue of complete mystery recordings very quickly indeed.<br /> Of course, Carmichael is the perfect Wimsey; but he is also very good at every other voice needed to make this an excellent reading. Some books-on-tape readers merely use their own voices throughout; and success depends on how interesting and appropriate that single voice is. Like David Suchet on the companion Poirot readings, Carmichael makes his reading into a full dramatization.<br /> Highly recommended for those who love a really intricate mystery read by a terrific actor.	2001-10-14

Having already reviewed the Audio Partners complete reading of &quot;The Code of the Woosters,&quot; I am happy to report that &quot;Carry on Jeeves&quot; (41109) is even a tad more successful.<br /> Any Jeeves fan must have noticed that the full novels are really a series of wild incidents put in to to stretch out a pretty flimsy plot premise. In the short stories, we have the typical pattern of Bertie Wooster ordered (by an aunt) to or tricked (by a friend) into helping out in some manner usually concocted by Jeeves with the ability of a master chess player who can see a dozen moves in advance. The original collection of stories under the title &quot;Carry On, Jeeves&quot; contains 10 independent episodes, of which eight have been chosen for this recording; and each fits the expected pattern.<br /> We start with Jeeves' first appearance &quot;Jeeves Takes Over.&quot; The other stories seem all to take place in New York City; and in two of them, Bertie is required to relinquish his flat so that some elderly relative of a friend will think it is the flat of the nephew. Telling the truth never seems to be the first course of action in any Jeeves story.<br /> The titles alone tell the story: &quot;The Rummy Affair of Old Biffy,&quot; &quot;Clustering Round Young Bingo,&quot; &quot;The Artistic Career of Corky&quot; are the ones that name the blighters who are thrust upon Bertie's good intentions and wallet. &quot;Without the Option,&quot; &quot;The Aunt and the Sluggard,&quot; &quot;Jeeves and the Unbidden Guest,&quot; &quot;Jeeves and the Hard-Boiled Egg&quot; are almost indistinguishable from the rest in plot and character, except that in the last one, the young man is actually admirable in his refusal to accept help from the Wooster largesse.<br /> Actor Marlin Jarvis does as good a job as did Jonathan Cecil in the earlier Jeeves recording, neatly adjusting his voice for each character; and indeed I would have thought I was hearing Ian Carmichael had I not known better.<br /> Another nice feature about these 4 tapes is that no story goes onto another cassette; and in only two of them do you have to turn the cassette over to hear the ending before the next story starts. Very considerately thought out by the producers.is refusal to accept help from the Wooster largesse.<br /> Actor Marlin Jarvis does as good a job as did Jonathan Cecil in the earlier Jeeves recording, neatly adjusting his voice for each character; and indeed I would have thought I was hearing Ian Carmichael had I not known better.<br /> Another nice feature about these 4 tapes is that no story goes onto another cassette; and in only two of them do you have to turn the cassette over to hear the ending before the next story starts.

Quite some time ago, we had a Life/Works of Mozart, more recently one of Chopin and now two more, Liszt and Beethoven. Both are even better packaged than are the earlier sets, with a thick booklet that offers us essays on the historical background, the position of the composer in his time, a look at the major works, a listening plan, recommended readings, personalities, a calendar of the artist's life, a glossary, a discography--and finally something I thought I would never see, the text of the recording's narration. This booklet is worth the price of the set alone.<br /> The Liszt set starts with the sound of artillery, the Beethoven with the sound of a cork popping. A good way to grab your attention, surely, but also to make you think they packaged the wrong disc in the jewel case!<br /> Written and narrated by Jeremy Siepmann, the production enlists some excellent actors to play the people in the composer's life. In the \\"Beethoven\\" set (8.558024-27), we have Bob Peck as the usually tormented voice of Beethoven, who is joined by David Timson, Neville Jason,  Elaine Claxton, and Karen Archer as the voices of Beethoven's friends, critics, and loves. The musical selections are drawn from the bottomless well of Naxos recordings.<br />  As I commented with regard to the other sets, the music is well chosen but some of it simply lasts too long for those who are eager to get on to the facts of the composer's life. On the other hand, this IS called the Life and Works series, and perhaps a balance is to be maintained between the two aspects.<br /> Beethoven's idiosyncrasies make a good comparison with those of Chopin, the former doing everything he could to call attention to himself, the latter withdrawn--but both acting like bloody fools in so many ways. Perhaps that is the price of genius. The tale of his \\"Immortal Beloved\\" is briefly treated here, but it is fascinating to follow his amores, which are invariably with women he could never hope to attain. The most surprising element is his early popularity as a Very Witty Person, an estimate he quickly lost when deafness came upon him.<br /> Along with the other three sets, a both fascinating and informative recording.<br />Question: ...amores, which are invariably with women he could never hope to attain.

An excellent idea was to use actors for the voices of Chopin (Anton Lesser), George Sand and other females in his life (Elaine Claxton and Karen Archer), and other male acquaintances (Neville Jason). It is the kind of reading that would fascinate even if the work were fictional.<br />  His letters are particularly fascinating, especially as they are read dramatically by the small cast; and one would rather hear about all his faults--physical and psychological--from people who knew him well. Perhaps his strange epistolary relationship with his Titus is dwelt upon a bit too much, but such are the times (then and now).<br />  My only criticism in a negative direction is the length of the musical examples. I do not really think the entire &quot;Revolutionary Etude&quot; had to be played or the entire &quot;Funeral March&quot;; a minute or two with a fadeout would have been fine, especially on repeated hearings where one wants the facts. Nevertheless, highly recommended.<br />By the way, the listing above of this work as &quot;abridged&quot; is simply inaccurate since the text (I am told by the publicity person at Naxos) was written specifically for this recording and is by definition &quot;unabridged.&quot;	2001-08-05

What will history say? BURGOYNE. History, sir, will tell lies, as usual.<br />  That telling little exchange comes from a G.B. Shaw play and the thought it expresses is the basis of one of the finest mystery novels ever concocted: Josephine Tey's &lt;The Daughter of Time.&gt;  Inspector Grant is injured from a previous case and is lying in a hospital bed memorizing the cracks in the ceiling. An actress friend of his brings him some pictures of people from history and one is particularly striking: sad, wise, a person you would like to know. But the reverse side identifies the face as that of Richard III, the greatest villain in English history.<br />  This is the character that all the old history books and especially Shakespeare tell us murdered King Henry VI, had his brother Gerorge drowned in a barrel of wine, drove his older brother, King Edward, into an early grave, put all his in-laws to death, killed his wife, and finally murdered his own nephews once he had stolen the crown from them. Add to this a hunchback, a shriveled arm, and a very sarcastic way of speaking, and you have one of the greatest No Goods ever. But not with that face!<br />  Grant, whose professional success depends on knowing a person by his face, cannot believe he could have been so mistaken and recruits his nurses, friends, fellow policemen, and even a young American researcher to bring him all they can about the Great Mystery of &quot;who murdered the princes in the tower.&quot; Little by little, the case against Richard falls to pieces; while the evidence begins to point in the most surprising direction.<br />  The wonderful thing about this novel is how it shows that so much of what we consider &quot;history&quot; is merely a pack of lies devised by the winning teams to blacken the opposition and whitewash themselves. The incident at &quot;Tonypandy,&quot; for example, is made much of in this novel. That was a town in Wales in which unarmed police were sent in to calm down striking miners and a bloody nose or two was the result. Yet word got out that armed troops fired into the crowd; and that version was accepted, simply because not a single person actually there felt like contradicting it.<br />  Another parallel is our own &quot;Boston Massacre&quot; in which a few thoughtless citizens began to stone a British sentry, thereby forcing a reluctant senior officer to fire into the crowd. Four casualties resulted. Paul Revere's engraving shows dozens being mowed down. But who would dare to say &quot;Liar&quot; to the official version?<br />  For a thorough enjoyment of this novel, you really need to be fairly familiar with Shakespeare's &quot;Richard III.&quot; Now bear in mind that the playwright got his information from &quot;Holinshed's Chronicles,&quot; which got its information from authors paid by the king who had defeated Richard III in battle, who got most of their information from one of Richard's deadliest enemies. One might as well accept &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; as an objective look at Germany during the years between World Wars.<br />  Reading this book, in fact, will change your entire attitude toward anything you read in any book or periodical that claims to present &quot;the facts.&quot; I will not ruin your enjoyment of this book by pointing out how Grant weighs the evidence that been accepted for so long as &quot;true&quot; and comes to the conclusions he does.<br />  Now the really Good News is that we have a wonderful recording of this complete text on a set of four Audio Partners tapes. Better yet, let me tell you it is read by Derek Jacobi--or better still, acted out by Derek Jacobi, because he finds a new voice for each character, the American being the best of the lot.<br />  In fact, having read the novel twice before and having heard this recording, I am compelled to try both formats again. Richard III might be a great villain on stage, but I firmly believe that the historical Richard deserves to have his case for the defense heard as often as possible. If for no other reason than to remind us of how many collections of &quot;historical facts&quot; might be little more than an imaginative treatment to bolster one's cause or downgrade another's. History, which is the Daughter of Time by the way, is written by the winners. It takes a good author like Tey to plead the case for the loser.<br />  Yes, a good deal of this book is the presentation to the reader of plenty of English history; but it is all made very palatable by the good dialogue and the many little peripheral details that give you rest stops along the way.<br />  And while waiting for delivery, watch the Olivier film again to brush up your Shakespeare.rd deserves to have his case for the defense heard as often as possible.

Now we have from the latter company a complete reading of 9 short mysteries from Dorothy Sayers' anthology &lt;Lord Peter Views the Body&gt; (61218).<br />  Strictly speaking, this is not quite an &quot;Unabridged&quot; set on 6 cassettes since the original book holds 12 tales. One of them is based around a crossword puzzle, so I can see how very difficult that would be to work into a reading. Still we should be grateful to have the 9 Audio Partners has treated us to.<br />  One of them will recall &quot;House of Wax,&quot; except this time it is metal plating (&quot;The Abominable History of the Man with Copper Fingers&quot;). Most of the stories have a light tone, as you can tell from the titles: &quot;The Fantastic Horror of the Cat in the Bag,&quot; &quot;The Undignified Melodrama of the Bone of Contention,&quot; &quot;The Piscatorial Farce of the Stolen Stomach&quot; (in which you will guess the solution early on), and so on.<br />  To me, the most interesting were &quot;The Bibulous Business of a Matter of Taste&quot; in which two (or is it three?) Peter Wimseys show up to purchase secret documents, and &quot;The Unsolved Puzzle of the Man with No Face&quot; in which the first half is concerned with Wimsey's theoretical reconstruction of a murder as reported in the papers and the second with the actual facts. The most unusual is the last, &quot;The Adventurous Exploit of the Cave of Ali Baba,&quot; in which Wimsey comes very close to being killed when he poses as a member of a secret organization.<br />  Carmichael, as the movie ads say, IS Peter Wimsey---and his voice is flexible enough to be all the other characters as well. Beautifully done.	2001-06-24

Kirk takes on a monumental job in her &lt;American Opera&gt; (University of Illinois Press). Starting in the Colonial times and ending just about at the publication date, this book traces the checkered career of its subject with a richness of detail that makes the 434 pages (plus appendices and index) very interesting reading indeed.<br />  It would have been even more interesting if the author had been a little more forthcoming about her own thoughts concerning the more contemporary works that call themselves &quot;operas&quot; by virtue of their being through-composed; but she certainly seems to have all the facts laid out objectively and in good order.<br />  The 18 chapters that lie between the Introduction and Epilogue are divided into three sections: (1) &quot;The Voyage, 1730 to 1915&quot;; (2) &quot;The Signposts, 1880 to 1960&quot;; and (3) &quot;The Discoveries, 1945 to the Turn of the Century.&quot; Each section in turn is divided into 6 topics with such titles as &quot;The Earliest American Operas,&quot; &quot;The Impact of Mass Media,&quot; and &quot;Dreamers of Decadence,&quot; to give one from each part.<br />  Ms. Kirk is very good in pointing out the novel aspects of works like &quot;Einstein on the Beach&quot; and &quot;Miss Julie.&quot; However, since very few of the works she seems to praise (albeit implicitly rather than explicitly) enjoy frequent (if any) revivals, I strongly feel that she should have examined the reasons why most of them never gained any popularity with the general public.<br />  For example, the first night audiences seemed most enthusiastic about Previn's &quot;Streetcar Named Desire,&quot; but in view of what the music critics had to say, one suspects they were applauding the production and the cast rather than the work. But our author remains silent on this aspect of American Opera.<br />  Still in all, I will be using this book as a valuable research tool for my seminars, especially the earlier sections when she does mention negative audience reactions to the Italian school of singing and other features of the granddaddies of &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot; and &quot;Susannah.&quot;n she does mention negative audience reactions to the Italian school of singing and other features of the granddaddies of &quot;The Ballad of Baby Doe&quot; and &quot;Susannah.&quot;	2001-06-18

These victims are introduced to us in great detail before they meet &quot;the Monster.&quot; In this way, the final confrontations with the shark are that much more meaningful to us.<br />  On the other hand, Capuzzo's method soon becomes obvious and therefore  predictable. The moment we meet a new character who is about to go swimming, we know what is going to happen in a few pages. So what suspense there is lies in our wondering if this person will escape, be only mutilated, or be dragged down to death. Much more interesting are the scientists who are engaged in a constant battle to convince people that sharks do not harm human beings, and their opponents who are not willing to blame killer whales after one person is attacked in water only three and a half feet deep.<br />  While some of the details are nauseatingly vivid, they lack that slick treatment that had the author of a more popular work of fiction smiling all the way to the bank. Capuzzo has opted for a newsman's objectivity and it works very nicely. And yet I feel that Cariou's reading is a bit too objective. Perhaps a little more excitement in his voice would have helped, but I am not really sure if that would have cheapened the effect of these descriptions drawn from journals and newspapers. I checked the book, by the way, and there are nine pages of bibliography, and it is a only select one at that.<br />  So it works well as a book of social history, of the hunting habits of sharks (which one reviewer finds &quot;erroneous&quot;), and as a jolly good thriller. Good listening in your car for those long drives--but not on your way to the shore for a day of swimming.little more excitement in his voice would have helped, but I am not really sure if that would have cheapened the effect of these descriptions drawn from journals and newspapers.

However, the &lt;Gramophone Classical Good CD Guide&gt; gives us what is new along with the best of what is older. Both serve a very useful purpose and I am quite pleased with the 2001 edition of the Gramophone offering.<br />  For example, there are now available two versions of &quot;The Mikado&quot; on EMI, and one each  on London, Telarc and TER. This edition mentions only one of the EMIs and gives plentiful reasons for that choice.<br />  Starting with a list of the 100 &quot;greatest&quot; classical recordings and a recommended library, both of which one can accept or ignore as simply somebody's opinion, we have the actual review sections covering 1263 pages. Here we have Adam to Zimmermann on 1110 pages with the selected recordings listed (where appropriate) by orchestral, chamber, instrumental, and vocal. There are then sections dealing with collections that include several composers: orchestral, chamber, instrumental, vocal, historic vocal, early music. And finally we have two excellent indexes of reviews and of artists. In this way, I was able to locate very quickly every mention of a particular baritone whose recordings I am collecting. (There were only four listed out of many that exist, but I could not get even that far in the Penguin format.)<br />  This volume will now sit with all the older ones for quick reference, especially concerning older recordings, which are being reissued on several &quot;budget&quot; labels by Philips, EMI and many of the other major companies. Incomplete but valuable nevertheless.	2001-06-06

Here we have a 2:27 hour abridgment read by the now internationally known British actor Simon Russell Beale, with very short scenes read by David Timson, Daniel Philpott, and Caroline Faber.<br />  Many scholars might carp at the choice of authors, since Pearson takes things from an actor's point of view; and a good deal of his assumptions are based on the &quot;fact&quot; that running a theater back then differed little from Pearson's own experiences in that field.<br />He tries to run a careful course between using passages from the plays as &quot;proof&quot; that Shakespeare must have thought thus and so and realizing that what a character says in a play may not (and probably doesn't) reflect the author's personal point of view. (Often the former method is valid. For example, Shakespeare almost never makes a positive reference to dogs or a negative one to highly spiced foods. One can reasonably assume he disliked dogs and bland food.)<br />  Yet Pearson often makes statements that rest on lines from the plays but do not really prove anything. Can we really take Othello's plea before killing himself as Shakespeare's own? Especially annoying is basing claims that the actor Shakespeare played certain parts on mere say so's that have been passed on from one generation to the other. It would be nice to know, for example, that Shakespeare acted the Prologue to &quot;Henry V&quot; so he could point to himself as &quot;the bending author&quot;; but this seems wish-fantasy on Pearson's part rather than even reasonable surmise. But Pearson is never boring and that is what also counts in a recorded reading such as this one.<br />  Beale's delivery cannot be faulted, nor can the short contributions of the three assistants. I know that I will play this many times again, especially on long car rides. I opted for the CD version (which I transferred to tape for the car), and there are enough tracking cues to make finding what you want pretty easy.

It also caused a storm of controversy at the Detection Club, of which she was a member, because she broke one of their prime rules of detective fiction writing. (The trouble is, I cannot tell you what rule that was without ruining the solution for you.) But even if you disregard the twist at the end, you still have a thumping good murder yarn that concentrates very closely on Poirot's methods of ignoring nothing and--how I wish many of us were like this--refusing to twist the facts to fit his theories.<br />  This novel benefits further from the supremely comic (and believable) character of Caroline Sheppard, the narrator's sister. (This book is in the form of a journal kept like those of Dr. Watson by a participant in the events and therefore is in the first person. This gives Christie the right to keep Poirot's thoughts unknown to us until they are revealed to the center of consciousness.)  The other characters, save that of Poirot, of course, are given just enough personality to make the plot work; but this is also expected in Christie's works.<br />  If you saw the dramatization of this book on A&amp;E, you will see how badly they bobbled the &quot;surprise ending&quot; and even changed Caroline's character in a totally unnecessary way. It does, however, pare away some of the really extraneous business that Christie added to make her plot more complicated.<br />  Nevertheless, here we are dealing with an excellent READING of the entire original work on six cassettes published by Audio Partners. In &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; and &quot;Murder on the Orient Express,&quot; which I have already reviewed, Audio Partners has David Suchet reading all the parts, using a different voice for each. Here we have actor Robin Bailey doing the honors and he is quite good. Of course, we might quibble that the character he is really playing, Dr. Sheppard, the writer of the journal, could not be quite so good a mimic; but as a reading, we suspend disbelief and enjoy Bailey's talent.<br />  What more to say? A very amusing novel read excellently is all one needs to give this Audio Partners offering a five-star rating.and he is quite good.

Later, Radio Spirits was good enough to issue new collections on both formats, giving each CD only two complete shows instead of three shortened ones.<br />  The latest entry, &lt;Legends of Comedy&gt;, holds only 10 cassettes or 10 CDs in the case with two shows on each. (The tapes are very awkwardly packaged, making it difficult to remove them if you are driving.) But though there is less material, there are plenty of laughs to go around. Mind you, there are already available Smithsonian collections with the same performers --&quot;Comedy From the Golden Age of Radio,&quot; &quot;Comedy Favorites,&quot; and &quot;Showbiz Teams&quot;-- but Radio Spirits has been careful not to duplicate anything from those selected for the earlier offerings.<br /> &quot;The Abbott &amp; Costello Program&quot; gives us two 1944 shows, the first of which is highlighted by a Who's-on-first-type verbal mixup over the names of dogs and the second of which has Lou revisit his old school in Patterson, NJ.  While &quot;The Amos 'n' Andy Show&quot; might no longer be politically correct, we have two hilarious shows from 1951, the first of which is a gem of the &quot;best laid plans often go astray&quot; variety. The 1940 &quot;Burns and Allen Show&quot; entries are strangely weak. Could it be because they lack the familiar theme song at the start? The &quot;Duffy's Tavern&quot; 1949 samples are very funny, with special thanks to Sheldon Leonard in his usual tough-guy role and Charles Coburn as an aged cardshark. &quot;Fibber McGee and Molly&quot; never seem to change and these 1945 shows are pretty much as weakly plotted but energetically acted as the one offered in the other sets. &quot;The Great Gildersleeve&quot; is notable for being one of the earliest known spin-offs from another show. Unhappily it is just another example of how a man trying to run a family cannot run his own life. Only the women seem to have any sense, at least back in 1947 when these were broadcast. &quot;The Jack Benny Progam&quot; is always good and these two from 1946 are no exception.

Very often an author does not supply the &quot;he said/she said&quot; before or after each quotation and the listener is often at a loss as to who is speaking. David Suchet, the ultimate Poirot, gets around this by using a different voice for each character. He had accomplished this in his reading of the complete &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; for Audio Partners and he does it again with a superlative &lt;Murder on the Orient Express&gt; for that same label.<br />  This set was designed for a release to coincide with the CBS dramatization of the classic whodunit, but Audio Partners need not have bothered. That telecast was an utter disaster with a lusterless Poirot, a cast that for the most part could scarcely create a character, and an updating of the decor (among other ludicrous changes) to the present. So the older film with its starry cast can rest unchallenged; but the public is entitled to enjoy the original and this audiobook is just the ticket.<br />  Christie uses the usual &quot;closed environment&quot; setting (an island, a cruiser, a train) to give us a small number of suspects; and then she hits us with Poirot's &quot;gather everyone together while I explain the solution&quot; scene. One of the gimmicks of this novel is that Poirot comes up with two solutions! But for the sake of those very few who do not know the ending, I will say no more. And even for those who do, there is always the joy of Suchet's reading.<br />  I have the CD edition, a format that makes it difficult to find where you last left off since each full chapter is usually given a single track number. Here Audio Partners has thoughtfully broken each chapter into several tracks so you pretty much can get back to where you were with a minimum of trouble. Tapes, of course, stay where they are--and are much better for use in autos.<br />  So by all means choose this as your next purchase, and do not forget the &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; offering while you are about it.ffering while you are about it.	2001-05-01

So we have Hercule Poirot himself in the person of David Suchet doing &quot;Death on the Nile&quot; for instance, and &lt;Murder at the Vicarage&gt; on six cassettes with James Saxton doing the honors.<br />  Now any review of a book on tape must consider the book itself and the reader separately. The latter might lack the vocal variety of Suchet--that is, he does not change his voice all that much for each character However, &quot;Vicarage&quot; is told in the first person by the Vicar himself, and so Saxton's voice is quite appropriate if one keeps in mind who is supposed to be speaking. In this way,  he does a very good job indeed of keeping up the listener's interest, although this particular Christie novel is not quite as spellbinding as was &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; for example.<br />  The tale itself was dramatized very well on PBS a while ago as part of the Joan Hickson &quot;Miss Marple&quot; series, but it did leave out a good deal of the adverse opinions that other residents of St. Mary Mead have of her.  None of the male characters seem to like her very much, but that is because they recognize her ability to see through the lies with which most of them surround themselves in even the most routine of days, let alone those that involve a shocking murder in the Vicar's own study<br />.  Not really a comic creation, Miss Marple still elicits broad smiles as she free-associates the present events and the people with those from her past experience and usually manages to come up with the solution on that basis alone. At any rate, this tale is just a tad padded and perhaps would have profited from a slight abridgment; but I am grateful to have a full edition, as it were, on this Audio Partners tape.	2001-04-16

Now it has reached its fourth incarnation, so to speak, as an audio book from Audio Partners in which the complete text is acted out (rather than simply read) by none other than David Suchet. This British actor (who once played Inspector Japp, by the way, in one of the updated Poirot films!) has become completely associated with the role through the PBS series, which is now available from Acorn Media, and is by far the most logical choice for reader.  He quite nicely manages a new voice for each character and (no surprise) his Poirot voice is the most successful.<br />  The story is a variation of the English manor house  murder novel. A manageably small group of people is on board a ship taking an Egyptian cruise and one of the party is murdered. While almost every character has excellent motive, the one with the strongest is the only one who definitely could not have done it. The rest, of course, could have--in true Christie fashion--and two other murders take place before Poirot gets his little gray cells to see the case from a completely novel but correct angle. One device I must admit annoys me is the device of having Poirot overhear a private conversation early in the story; but here it does little harm to credibility and is just part of the fun.<br />  So we have a thumping good mystery, interesting characters, a supersleuth, and Suchet's superb reading to make this Audio Partners offering a very good choice.	2001-03-13

Naturally we cannot object that they keep a record of every purchase we have made from them, and some of us are even a little in awe of how they give us personal recommendations whenever we enter their website, basing what they think we would like on what we have already demonstrated liking through our purchases.<br />  Now carry that a step further. Assume they know a lot more about us from computer data banks: our school records, our hospital records, even our jail records (if any), our financial records--you name it. And now go an extra step and assume they can enter any of these records and change them without leaving a trace by creating a &quot;trapdoor&quot; for themselves. Finally assume that you are contacted by some Higher Up in the company who begins by sending you out to recruit new customers and ends by ordering you to murder anyone actively working against them.<br />  And add to this that along the way you have been brainwashed into thinking that you are doing all of this for the greater good of mankind! There, by a close analogy, is the plot and theme of &quot;The Code.&quot;<br />  Ken Sheldon's experience in the computer field got him started on this novel, but he had to do some extra research about how San Francisco homicide detectives really work, how the FBI uses data banks to track criminals, and how religious cults attract new members. Also, like any other author, he has been influenced by the writings of Ludlum (with his countless &quot;conspiracy&quot; novels), Crichton (with his science-fiction works such as &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;), and doubtless specialists who study how large masses of people tend to act under given circumstances.<br />  &quot;People need community,&quot; Ken wrote to me. Often the greatest sin is to turn against a member of your special group. Rather, we tend to advertise our allegiances on T-shirts, on our car bumpers, on our hats, around our necks. As Ken puts it, we join a &quot;tribe&quot; and remain faithful to it just to give some meaning to our lives, a meaning we cannot find in other ways.<br />  Now add to that the increasing number of mergers of lesser giant corporations with larger giants, mix in some politicians who are bought and sold by those corporations, and you can see how websites can become a most dangerous tool to manipulate the &quot;joiners.&quot; He likens the Internet to &quot;the wild west during the land rush of the 19th century.&quot; The difference here is that it is far easier to hide your associations with other organizations if you operate electronically.<br />  So &quot;The Code&quot; should be enjoyed by those who are against this sort of Big Brother threat, especially by those who have become slightly paranoid over it all, as well as those who can see how computers can be used in a positive way really to help us and not enslave us. Of course, this novel sticks to the Dark Side of the Force, very much in the tradition of &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;1984&quot; with just a touch of Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy mixed in. In other words, it could happen here. And it has already started.<br />  Ken Sheldon admits that he is no Henry James (thank goodness, say I) and that he aimed no higher than a good read. Here he succeeded, I believe, very nicely. I found myself eagerly looking forward to the next chapter. If I must criticize (in a negative sense) anything, it is that his hero, Randall McLagan,  has just enough personality to keep the plot moving; but he is not particularly interesting in himself. He is simply an Everyman trying to find out why his friend fell from the Golden Gate Bridge and running at every turn into something called The Code. Sheldon uses the &quot;third-person omniscient&quot; point of view so we always know more than Randall does; and you can guess all you want about the identity of the Arch Villain behind it all without being right--except by pure chance.w more than Randall does; and you can guess all you want about the identity of the Arch Villain behind it all without being right--except by pure chance.	2001-03-03

Wodehouse fill the bill. It is even jollier when a good British comedian simply reads the novel to you, as does Jonathan Cecil in the Audio Partners release of the 1938 &lt;The Code of the Woosters: Jeeves to the Rescue&gt; (1-57270-182-X).<br />  Here on 6 audiocassettes with a total running time of 7 hours is one of the stories you might have seen dramatized on Masterpiece Theatre a while ago. Oh, you know, the one about Bertie having to steal a cow-shaped creamer from Sir Watkyn Bassett for his Aunt Dahlia. Along the way, he becomes entangled in the on again, off again engagement between the newt-loving Gussie Fink-Nottle and the simpering Madeline Bassett, Roderick Spode who heads the Black Shorts (since all the Black Shirts have been bought up by an Italian of the period) and harbors a shameful secret), Stiffy Bynge who wants to marry the local clergyman H.P. &quot;Stinker Pinker,&quot; and the local Constable whose helmet has been pinched.<br />  The plot is simple at first and then, as in any good farce, rapidly accelerates into the complexity of a Baroque French clock and with about as much socially redeeming value. We simply sit back and marvel at the mechanism as (to carry on the analogy) Wodehouse's puppet-like characters perform their intricate movements around the hapless Bertie Wooster who not for the first time in these stories tends to lose faith in Jeeves just as that master of intrigue is at his brainiest. All this in the inimitable Wodehouse upper-class British twit jargon and a world every bit as real as that of Damon Runyon and W.S. Gilbert, providing you accept certain premises.<br />  Jonathan Cecil was very badly miscast as Arthur Hastings in two or three Poirot films in which Peter Ustinov played the sleuth. Here he is a gem, reading as he does every word of the novel and acting out every character, male and female, in a different voice. His reading, Wodehouse's literary style and plotting, and all the rest made 7 hours on the exerciser pass pleasantly quickly.<br />  Highly recommended even for more relaxed listeners.every character, male and female, in a different voice.

Actor George Guidall has the perfect voice for the homey, Moose County sound that is essential when one person is assigned the dramatization of not only the narration but all the dialogue and cat noises to boot.<br />There is a minimum of music and no sound effects--which I think is a good idea in a reading like this. Of course, even the best reading in the world is worthless if the material is not worth the while. This is only my second exposure to this series, and I must admit I find it at times a little long on cute and short on suspense. There is also too much extraneous detail, designed, no doubt, to add local color (which it does nicely) but not much of which ties in with the plot.<br />Although the author is very careful to make her James Qwilleran feel ambiguously about the psychic powers of his cats, it does get a little too much for credibility; unless, of course, you want to argue that she is not writing on a completely realistic plane. Still what we do have is very pleasant and I found the tape very enjoyable. Many might find it a very good introduction to the series of 23 cat mysteries and motivate them to read them in part or whole.	2001-02-11

I have long admired Mr. West ever since an old Masterpiece Theater portrayal of Edward VII and many appearances on other British TV imports. Of Ms. Dench, little has to be said--she is the supreme actress.<br />  I really doubted if the contents of these two cassettes or CDs with a running time of only 2.5 hours could do justice to either Shakespeare's life or work; and of course it does not. What it does accomplish works on two levels. For both beginner and Ph.D. holder, there are the readings of the two stars. Granted, each selection is very short indeed, sometimes only two or three lines. But what a joy it is to hear Mr. West take on so many roles with so many voices from the young Coriolanus to the ancient Lear. And Dame Judi's enunciation should be a lesson to all actresses who are taught to mumble and whisper by recent directors who wish to keep the dialogue a secret from the audience.<br />  There is little new for the advanced English major in the portions that are narrated by the authors, Richard Hampton and David Weston, both of whom are actors and directors with the Royal Shakespeare Company. At best, their script is a miracle of concision, telescoping both the life and works into a cohesive narrative that must leave out so much of the life to leave time for the works. Yes, every one of the plays (except &quot;Two Noble Kinsmen&quot;) is treated with varying degrees of brevity; and a listener totally unfamiliar with any (or all) of them can get a decent idea of what the play is about both in plot and theme. Those thoroughly familiar with the plays might smile at some of the simplifications required to carry off this recording (is Iago really the most evil villain in the plays?) while still admiring how the writers got right down to the essential points without too much editorializing.<br />  All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in our language's greatest poet or in the art of reading his lines. Thank you, Audio Partners.too much editorializing.<br />  All in all, I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in our language's greatest poet or in the art of reading his lines.

I must confess I have seen a complete episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; only once and was not particularly impressed, and subsequent partial viewings did not change my mind. But I am always immensely interested in accounts of how complex procedures are carried out; and the technical aspects of voice-overs seemed like a very interesting topic for a book. Provided, I thought, that the author does not introduce all sorts of autobiographical impedimenta along the way.<br />  Well, after the first two chapters, I was hooked. Nancy Cartwright has a delightful conversational style, marred only by a steady use of slang that was popular in the early days of the show but used here to create a feeling of the bond between human and cartoon characters. And where she does discuss her private life, it is always with reference to her main subject.<br />  My only major objection is that the technical part of her narrative starts with recording of the voices and only later in the book does she explain about the storyboards and the gels. Perhaps a chapter early in the book giving a brief &quot;flow chart&quot; of the procedure would have led to less confusion (at least on my part).<br />  There are 23 chapters, 12 of which are generally shorter and written, somewhat annoyingly, in italics. These dozen recount her meetings with several celebrities from the unintentionally funny grand entrance of Liz Taylor and her entourage to the no-nonsense professionalism of Meryl Streep. And I would very much love to have heard Mel Gibson do a &quot;Curly laugh&quot;! It is in Chapter 15, &quot;My Mom is Bart Simpson,&quot; that the author creates an interview which finally gets down to the psychological aspects of being known as a voice--and not even one's natural one-- rather than as a whole person. I would like to see this chapter excerpted in books designed for would-be actors.<br />  It is certain that &quot;Simpsons&quot; fans will wear this book out reading it again and again. It does have minor stylistic and expository flaws; but in general it does what it sets out to do. It celebrates the author's rise to fame, the success of the show, and (by implication) the phenomenon of a cartoon family becoming internationally famous.<br />  To quote Shakespeare: &quot;If this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction.&quot;It is certain that &quot;Simpsons&quot; fans will wear this book out reading it again and again.

One of  their more recent entries is a very modern version of Sophocles' &lt;Oedipus Rex&gt; in a translation by Duncan Steen. In fact, some might find it a little too modern with its use of idiomatic expressions such as &quot;You can't pin that on me&quot;--which might be taken as an ironic reference to the final horrible deed of the hero. But when the messenger the agonized Oedipus as calling himself a &quot;mother f...&quot; (although he stops at the &quot;f&quot;) the effect is far too &quot;modern&quot; for comfort. You see, given a sound recording, we can only assume that the action is taking place in the nearly prehistoric past. I do not know the tone of Sophocles' Greek; but I do read that it is elegant and decorous. Therefore, I can only assume that this translator is doing his source a great injustice.<br />  On the other hand, the dialogue MOVES. There is an excitement to this performance, although the Creon of Adam Kotz lacks some force. Michael Sheen is good in the title role, as is Nichola McAuliffe as Jocasta, Heathcote Williams as the Chorus Leader, and John Moffatt as Tiresias and the Narrator at the start of the recording. The Chorus itself is cut down to four voices, but they are handled nicely with stereo separation and are quite comprehensible. The music is meager but effectively used.<br />  All in all, a very good if not perfect attempt at making one of the greatest Western plays accessible to a wide audience.	2000-11-18

Granted that some passages are read a bit too swiftly to be followed by those without texts open before them, but one gets the feeling that this is a play and not a 400 year old monument. There are moments, however, when one could use some extra noises-on, so to speak. When Iago gets Cassio drunk, a little more rowdiness from extras would be appropriate--but perhaps I am spoiled by too many film versions and certainly by the full chorus in Verdi's opera.<br />  Hugh Quarshie makes a more interesting Othello than a great one. He does not have that Paul Robeson voice that one tends to associate with the role, and he understands the part light years better than the Othello of that unfortunate film version a few years back. But his lightweight approach does not work when the mouth-filling flights of poetry make their demands after he is convinced of Desdamona's infidelity.<br />  Anton Lesser also makes a fine but not great impression as Iago. Perhaps he needs to use more variety of delivery when he is being &quot;honest&quot; with the other characters. After all, his approach to Othello should not be in the same key as that to Roderigo or even to Cassio. Iago is a supreme actor, so it takes an equally supreme one to play him.<br />  For once, we can hear Emilia (Patience Tomlinson) hesitate when she speaks of the &quot;lost&quot; handkerchief; although on a sound recording she cannot give us the body-language to explain why she betrays her lady for the sake of her husband. The Cassio (Roger May) is very good in the handkerchief scene with Iago and the hidden, miscomprehending Othello.<br />  The running time is just over 3 hours, 11 minutes longer than the venerable Shakespeare Recording Society with Frank Silvera as Othello and Cyril Cusack as Iago, now available on Harper Audio. There still might be available a very dull version with Richard Johnson and Ian Holm, but avoid it.ry dull version with Richard Johnson and Ian Holm, but avoid it.	2000-11-18

What follows refers only to the Naxos set.<br />There are now three complete recordings of &lt;Twelfth Night&gt; available. We have the older and elegantly read version on Harper Audio with Dorothy Tutin as the best Viola of the lot. Acted with a bit more verve though with less poetry is the Arkangel Shakespeare recording with a Scottish Malvolio and a cast of younger sounding actors who are making names for themselves in Great Britain. However I am very impressed with the &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; that is one of the latest additions to the Naxos Classic Drama series.<br />  By far, this is the best-produced &quot;Twelfth Night.&quot; One actually feels he is hearing an actual stage performance with all of the action but with the loss of none of the poetry. Perhaps the Viola does sound a little maturer than imagination would have her and the Sir Toby Belch a little less belchy sounding than others. None of the Festes sing as marvelously as did Peter Pears on the long deleted Marlowe Society recording (also with Tutin); however, on this Naxos set David Timson stays nicely in tune--and directs the production to boot. And he keeps things moving neatly along, which is saying a lot for Shakespeare recordings.<br />  The CD version has the advantage of excellent tracking cues for not only each scene but for key points within the scene. The Harper CDs give a new track only for each new scene and the tapes (of course) are quite useless in that regard. The Arkangel series at present exists only on tapes but they are planning to reissue the entire series on CDs. So this Naxos release is the one of choice so far.	2000-11-04

The last three are  preserved on cylinders and the Booth one is scarcely audible. All of these  readings are in the grand style, and it is instructive to compare the  &quot;Once more unto the breach&quot; of Waller and Benson with that of  Olivier. Terry's youthful delivery belies her age, but too many of the  readers came to the recording session far past their prime. Still, this is  living history and utterly fascinating as such.<br />  The  &quot;Miscellany&quot; is a mixed bag indeed. We have pairs of actors such  as Noel Coward and Gertrude Lawrence in &quot;Private Lives,&quot; Fred  Terry and Julia Neilson in a poorly chosen scene from &quot;The Scarlet  Pimpernel,&quot; John Gielgud and Edith Evans in the marvelous handbag  scene from &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest,&quot; and even Laurel and  Hardy recording in London. (Strange bedfellows indeed.)<br />  Solo  &quot;turns&quot; are performed by Tree as Svengali, Bransby Williams  imitating Irving in &quot;The Bells&quot; and several (then) notable  theatre personalities in his monologue &quot;The Stage Doorkeeper,&quot;  Henry Ainley reading &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade,&quot; and  Charles Laughton reading (of all things) The Gettysburg Address (from the  film &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;).<br />  The last foreign-language  selections will not be of great interest to many listeners and of immense  interest to students of European acting styles. We have Sarah Bernhardt  reading &quot;Phedre,&quot; Jean Mournet-Sully as Oedipus (in French),  Constant Coquelin, the original Cyrano, racing through the Ballade of the  Duel, Feodor Chaliapin reading a poem in a language I cannot identify, and  Alexander Moissi doing excellent readings from &quot;Faust&quot; and the  &quot;Erlkoenig.&quot;<br />  The notes are brief but informative and were  written by David Timson, whose &quot;History of Theatre&quot; is also  available on Naxos and reviewed on its appropriate web site.ournet-Sully as Oedipus (in French),  Constant Coquelin, the original Cyrano, racing through the Ballade of the  Duel, Feodor Chaliapin reading a poem in a language I cannot identify, and  Alexander Moissi doing excellent readings from &quot;Faust&quot; and the  &quot;Erlkoenig.&quot;<br />  The notes are brief but informative and were  written by David Timson, whose &quot;History of Theatre&quot; is also  available on Naxos and reviewed on its appropriate web site.	2000-09-08

His readings  are marvelous, especially because he manages to use a different voice for  each new character--and there are many, many of them. It is fascinating to  catch so many of the concepts Gilbert was to recycle in the later Savoy  works. &quot;The Bumboat Woman's Story&quot; is rich in pre-hints of  &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot; and was indeed the inspiration for the ballet  &quot;Pineapple Poll,&quot; which uses only Sullivan's music for the  operettas (with a snatch of his Da Ballo Overture thrown in). Doubtless the  funniest of the lot is &quot;Etiquette&quot; on the last side of the second  tape in which two men thrown up on a dessert island cannot converse because  they had not been properly introduced aboard the ill-fated vessel. Not all  the poems are comical-- some are darkly pessimistic--but there is many a  laugh that will educed by Broadbent's delivery.<br />&quot;Bab,&quot; by the  way, was Gilbert's baby nickname; and his use of it tells us a lot about  his personality.<br />Dove Audio, however, has packaged these two cassettes  with no table of contents at all; and so there is no way to tell ahead of  time exactly what Bab Ballads are recorded, which is really an intolerable  situation for an item like this. Also the use of &quot;unabridged&quot; at  the top of this Amazon.com page is misleading. While each poem is in fact  complete, there are represented here only a very small portion of Gilbert's  BB output. What we do have is excellently done, but the 3 hours on these  tapes do not hold an &quot;unabridged&quot; collection by any means.	2000-09-01

The author himself admits  this in the notes provided with the  tapes and can be forgiven. What there  is here would make an excellent review for a theatre major studying for  exams and an even better introduction to one not all that familiar with the  story of our theatre as it progressed from the rites dedicated to Dionysus  to what it is today. Of course, the important playwrights are touched upon  (Shakespeare gets an all too brief treatment) and the English ones get what  is perhaps a somewhat disproportionate amount of attention. But as English  speakers, we will not carp at that.<br />  An especially good feature of this  set is the use of professional actors--Carole Boyd, John McAndrew, Teresa  Gallagher and Caroline Faber--to give some short excerpts from major works.  The booklet gives a brief  &quot;Glossary of technical terms not explained  in the text,&quot; a need created perhaps by the author's being an  actor.<br />  Once again, you will enjoy hearing this set even if you have no  exams coming up; and it will give you a very nice idea of where our present  theatre has come from, if not where it is going.	2000-08-21

Radio Spirits  has issued this collection in two formats: 20 audio cassettes each holding  90 minutes of material (usually 3 half-hour shows) and 30 CDs each holding  60 minutes. This last is an improvement over other tape/CD issues in which  the latter had to be abridged to fit in the shows what the corresponding  tape could easily hold without cuts.<br />  Some of the shows here have only  a fleeting visit by Sinatra, others have him in short sketches, still  others as co-star, and a few as the star himself. For example, he plays a  major role when guesting on a Burns &amp;Allen Show but is the star of his  own series, &quot;Rocky Fortune,&quot; of which this collection offers four  episodes. These episodes, by the way, are a good example of Sinatra in his  bad years after MGM fired him because of an unfortunate remark he made  about the studio head's mistress. They work very well as light comedy  mysteries but certainly do not call for any great acting skills. At his  nadir, he substituted for Bill Stern in the Sports Newsreel series and did  a very good job as narrator.<br />  He is heard in several dramatic roles in  &quot;Suspense&quot; and &quot;Lux Radio Theater,&quot; and a good deal of  jokes are made about his possibly receiving and later his actually  receiving an Academy Award for his role in &quot;From Here to  Eternity.&quot; Included in his many comic guest spots with Fred Allen,  Jack Benny, Edgar Bergen, Joan Davis, and Martin &amp; Lewis are endless  &quot;skinny&quot; jokes, none of which seem to be repeated except possibly  the one about being buried in the back yard by the family dog.<br />  Naturally, you will hear a good deal of his vocalizing, once even with Lou  Costello, and that is pretty much the raison d'etre of this collection. And  if you have to listen to &quot;Nancy With the Laughing Face&quot; three  times, well that is what fathers are for.<br />  The question is whether to  purchase the tapes or CDs. I have both. I heard all the tapes in my car and  will use the CDs for my classes because of the direct access feature.  However the CDs are packaged in such a way that you must touch the surfaces  in removing them from their plastic envelopes--and drivers should take note  that you need two hands to do so.<br />  As a postscript, I should add that  you don't have to be a particular fan of Sinatra to enjoy this collection.  You get &quot;A Date With Judy,&quot; &quot;Command Performance,&quot;  &quot;Life With Luigi,&quot; a &quot;Savings Bond Show,&quot; and so many  other radio gems that still linger in the memories of us older crowd--and  some that would be totally forgotten were it not for such Radio Spirit  compilations as this one.mes, well that is what fathers are for.<br />   The question is whether to  purchase the tapes or CDs.

Jasen and Gene Jones should be declared national treasures. Along with their excellent account &quot;That American  Rag,&quot; published by Schirmer Books, they have given us &lt;Spreadin'  the Rhythm Around: Black Popular Songwriters, 1880-1930&gt; from the same  publishing house.<br />  Reading this fabulous account of so many talented  Blacks hitting their heads against the stone wall of prejudice at almost  every turn, I was fascinated, sad, and increasingly angry at story after  story about composer after composer, lyricist after lyricist, who had so  much to offer and and were for the most part obliged to perpetuate the  stereotypical image imposed upon them and their people. Now and then, a  bright light breaks through as with the story of James Resse Europe's Clef  Club, a union of black musicians that managed (with the help of Irene and  Vernon Castle) to make their orchestras and bands those of choice by white  high society. You will be equally riveted to the other accounts of men like  James A. Bland, Bert Williams, W.C. Handy, Noble Sissle, Eubie Blake, and  others some more familiar and less familiar to most readers.<br />  Many of  the defeats described are not necessarily the result of racism. When one of  the personalities involved was at fault through his own temper or poor  judgment, the authors do not shirk in pointing out where the blame lies.  They also do something I found lacking in their other book: when they say  how good or innovative a song was, they give reasons in musical terms for  that judgment.<br />  On the other hand, whereas their other book has  amazingly concise and full appendices of works, dates, publishers, and so  on, this book has none. I would greatly have appreciated a list of the all  the shows mentioned in the text in chronological order. Perhaps a later  edition will include this.	2000-08-11

Jasen and Gene Jones (Schirmer Books, 2000). It tells in some 307 pages of text and  another 100 or so of lists and charts &quot;the Story of Ragtime from Coast  to Coast&quot; in great detail, far too great for quick reading. Indeed, I  am going to use this tome as a reference book in the future as a source of  information for my articles and talks, with due acknowledgment of  course.<br />  Starting with the seeding and growth of rag in the fertile soil  of Missouri, this book traces the development of the form through the  sections of our country, ending up with New York City. The material is  further organized by composer and publishing house, so it is easy to locate  any particular composer by using the table of contents rather than the  index. But again, I suggest you assimilate all this in small doses.<br />  While I am giving this wonderful history a top rating, I must voice a  personal observation concerning what I think is a curious omission. There  is much mention about this and that rag being a masterpiece or at least  immensely popular or pioneering; but I fail to locate a single explanation  of WHY the music was so important or different. Perhaps the authors  preferred to avoid musicology, but I still consider this a real lack in an  otherwise excellent work.	2000-07-15

Now that I have all the Diana Rigg episodes  on VHS and the last season of the Honor Blackman ones on DVD, while my  fuzzy copies off late-night tv of the Linda Thorson entries await  replacement by commercial ones--well, this book was a wonderful reminder of  how much fun it was to await eagerly each new episode when they were still  new and unabridged by the increasing time allowed for commercials.<br />  What this book also tells us is how the participants did not particularly  have as much fun making the series as we did watching them. When Diana Rigg  announced that coal miners were making more than they were--a remark that  did not endear her to coal miners--or when the cast of &quot;The New  Avengers&quot; found they were not going to be paid--or when Joanna Lumley  stood up at a gathering and let the others know how hard the cast worked  while everyone else partied, we begin to reconsider what came over the tube  in a new light and admire the actors even more for not showing their  displeasure before the cameras.<br />  As is common today in &quot;confess  all&quot; autobiographies, Macnee is quite honest about his weight and  drinking problems; and more interestingly, about his feelings of  inferiority before such &quot;real&quot; actors (as he puts it late in the  book) as Diana Rigg and Ian McKellen (but not Orson Welles, for reasons  that you will find in the last chapter).<br />  This edition boasts lots of  good stills, especially the color shots of Honor Blackman episodes which we  know only in black and white. I feel it could have used more  behind-the-camera anecdotes and I certainly miss an index. But what there  is is quite good and fans will certainly love it all.	2000-07-09

But just the first two volumes are a terrific  research tool and reference source for any one truly interested in enjoying  and fully appreciating the operas of  Verdi.<br />  Volume 1 covers  &quot;Oberto&quot; to &quot;Rigoletto,&quot; 2 covers &quot;Il  Trovatore&quot; to &quot;&quot;La Forza del Destino,&quot; and 3 &quot;Don  Carlos&quot; to the final &quot;Falstaff.&quot; The revised edition, which  is now available in paperback format, begins with an introduction to Verdi  and his times and a general consideration of the early operas. Volume 2  offers two chapters on the changing traditions in Italian opera and Verdi's  maturing in his craft; while Volume 3 (in the hardcover edition I managed  to find) plunges directly into the operas.<br />  Each opera is handled in  two sections. First an in-depth narration of the circumstances leading to  the creation and opening night of each work, and then a scene by scene  analysis of plot and music. This differs from the organization of the  one-volume Charles Osborne book, &quot;The Complete Operas of Verdi,&quot;  which treats the music separately from plot. As much as I admire and have  used that work for years, I believe the Budden volumes--so much fuller and  therefore so much more useful--will supplant it from this time forward.<br />  I can only urge Oxford to reissue that 3rd volume as soon as possible.	2000-07-08

Her first datable work is from1926, her last from 1973. A remarkable woman  in what was after all a man's craft.<br />  Equally fascinating were her  co-workers: Jimmy McHugh, Jerome Kern, Arthur Schwartz, Sigmund Romberg.  And they are all here in Deborah Grace Winer's &lt;On the Sunny Side of the  Street: the Life and Lyrics of Dorothy Fields&gt; (Schirmer Books,  1997).<br />  I did enjoy this book immensely and found it easy reading. What  I missed was a sense of the personality around which this book is centered.  Read about Dorothy Parker, for example, and you have a sense of what drove  this artist. No such feeling comes from this book, in which the author has  taken an objective view of the life and times of Fields and made little  attempt to get &quot;under the skin,&quot; so to speak. Perhaps I ask for  the impossible since the author was not privy to any personal writings of  her subject. But there are always friends who could have been mined for  such information. Dorothy also tends to get a little lost for pages at a  time as the personalities of other luminaries of the time are discussed. As  fascinating as they all are, our interest wanders too often from the main  character.<br />  Still I give this book 5 stars for what it does and not  subtract for what I personally think it lacks. The illustrations are quite  good, by the way, and the inclusion of many of her lyrics is a good thing.	2000-07-06

It should read &quot;A Listener's Guide to 11 Operas,&quot; because that is the scope of this otherwise  excellent 511-page volume.<br />  The works covered are &quot;Giulio Cesare  in Egitto,&quot; &quot;Iphegenie in Tauride,&quot; &quot;Don  Giovanni,&quot; &quot;Fidelio,&quot; &quot;Il Barbiere di Siviglia,&quot;  &quot;Rigoletto,&quot; &quot;Die Walkure,&quot; &quot;Carmen,&quot;  &quot;Salome,&quot; &quot;Porgy and Bess,&quot; and &quot;Peter  Grimes.&quot; As you can see, Dr. Sacher has chosen to represent different  ages as well as different countries; and while we might quibble with his  specific choices, we cannot fault his treatment of those he has chosen.<br />  The first part devotes about 60 pages to the history, views, and tools of  Opera as an art form. The next 40 or so pages deal with such abstractions  as &quot;the Human Condition&quot; and how opera relates to conscience,  spirituality, a sense of good and evil, introspection, and so on. Like most  works devoted to such lofty matters, there is less &quot;information&quot;  and more poetic speculation in this section. Still, these are terms in  which many people define aspects of our culture; and, at least, this author  uses concrete examples from the operas to make his point, however abstract  it might be.<br />  The bulk of the book is concerned with the 11 operas and  here is where the value of the work is most evident. Each of the operas is  treated with more or less the same format. Background information is  provided about the opera, its times and its style. A specific element is  then discussed, such as the ambiguity of Zerlina's reactions  during the  duet &quot;La ci darem la mano&quot; or the Fate motif in  &quot;Carmen.&quot; Several music examples are given for present and future  references.<br />  Then each opera is explained, scene by scene, with plot in  Roman type and musical details in Italics.

The only competitive set is available from Harper  Collins and stars a somewhat miscast Robert Stephens in the title role.  When I say &quot;miscast,&quot; I mean that his reading lacks the charm and  the humor that Olivier was able to infuse into the villainy. Here on  Arkangel, David Troughton fares somewhat better. But.<br />  Perhaps after  all the recent psychopathic Richards we have had,  from Ian Holm in 1963  through a long line of Richards on crutches and bald,  Frankenstein-lookalike  Richards, Troughton's reading is something of a  relief. But of course we have only the voice to go by. The play opens with  a laugh of glee before the opening words; but for the rest of the first  three acts that element of fun is simply not there. Richard is not enjoying  himself enough for me. He does, however, come up with some original  readings of his &quot;My kingdom for a horse&quot; utterances.<br />  The  Queen Elizabeth of Sonia Ritta is poorly done indeed. For a queen  &quot;well struck in years&quot; and &quot;a beauty waning and distressed  widow,&quot; she sounds far too young and too modern in her defiance of  Richard early in the play and her yielding to him (if that is how you  interpret the second wooing scene) later on. Perhaps some more oiliness on  the part of Philip Voss's Buckingham would have helped to distinguish him  from the others in the cast.<br />  The pacing of the scene with the  messengers is far too slow and ends with the same adagio chamber music used  more effectively earlier in the recording. This is, I believe, the only  Arkangel set that plays music during a soliloquy and it works well here.  The sound of horses at every opportunity grows wearisome--especially after  the three Henry VI plays--and is not necessary in several instances.<br />  Still, &quot;Richard III&quot; is one of Shakespeare's earliest successes  that still attracts actors and audiences to this day; and this set is well  worth the having and hearing.quot; is one of Shakespeare's earliest successes  that still attracts actors and audiences to this day; and this set is well  worth the having and hearing.	2000-06-23

None of the action and certainly none of the characters  are particularly complex; although a good deal of background information  about Richard II and Henry IV is requisite to appreciating what is  happening here. And when &quot;Richard III&quot; follows, this play is made  so much clearer appearing as it does as the logical consequence of all the  events that came before it. Therefore I am delighted to report (1)  &lt;Henry VI, Part 1, 2, and 3&gt; are now available as late entries in the  remarkable Arkangel Shakespeare series put out by Penguin Putnam, and (2)  they make for some terrific listening.<br />  Using some military music and  representative battle cries for the many combat scenes and the opening and  closing of doors to let us know about entrances and exits, this set gives  us a fast-paced account of Shakespeare's dramatic shaping of so many years  of tumultuous English history.<br />  Now this play has a large cast and it  is very seldom clear just who is speaking at any given moment--a problem  endemic to any play on tape with several characters--and it is recommended  that one have a text handy during the first hearing. Or if you have seen  the magnificent BBC productions of this trilogy, you might be able to know  who is speaking from your memory of that series. Suffice it to say, most of  the important characters can be recognized by their voices, although (as  many critics have pointed out) all the men do tend to speak alike until the  very idiosyncratic voice of Richard Gloucester appears late in Part II.<br />  Since the demise of the old legendary series on Decca/London label back  in the LP days, this is the only recording we have of these three plays;  and we are very fortunate they are done so well.<br />  The &quot;Richard  III&quot; came out at the same time and I will record my comments about  that set on the appropriate webpage.omments about  that set on the appropriate webpage.	2000-06-23

In  general, and this is true of most of this new series, the Arkangel actors  seem a lot younger (the Jacques of Gerard Murphy perhaps too much so) and  give a more modern (i.e., less lyrical) reading to the text.<br />  I think  the Arkangel might appeal more to younger listeners, but both sets are  quite good and it would be difficult to choose between them. Niamh Cusack  is a quite believable Rosalind, while Stephen Mangan (Orlando)does what he  can with a rather silly role, although he does miss a good moment in his  blandly delivered retort to the Wrestler about mocking him too soon. I  could wish Clarence Smith's Touchstone had a bit more &quot;character&quot;  in his voice. Victoria Hamilton is quite charming as Celia. I was quite  taken with the almost Ronald Coleman voice of Philip Voss as Duke  Senior.<br />  The music, neither Elizabethan nor modern but  more like  American western, is nevertheless appropriate. The singers on the older  recordings, however, have far superior voices. An annoying feature is the  tendency to overdo the sound effects. Once we establish a woodland or a  garden by a few bird tweets, it is really unnecessary to continue them over  the dialogue as is done here.<br />  Since the director's choice in these  recordings is to have no narrator to supply stage directions, the listener  without a text can get quite lost during all the references to  &quot;you&quot; and &quot;you&quot; in the denouements of the last scene.  Perhaps they can take a hint from the Branagh recordings on Bantam and  simply have the character call the addressee by name. Here we do get some  non-verbal sounds from the other actors by way of identification, but they  are of minimal use.

In fact, not since hearing the recording of &quot;The Professor and  the Madman&quot; have I actually looked forward to my next session at my  tape player.<br />  Briefly, the book falls into four major sections. There  is a marvelous retelling of the rise to power and the customs of those who  lived on Nantucket in the 1820s, including such all too human accounts of  how the wives had to resort to opium and &quot;he's-at-homes&quot; during  the long absences of their husbands. Then comes the events on the whaleship  Essex up to its sinking by the 85 foot sperm whale that inspired Melville's  Moby Dick. The third part, which many might find very difficult to bear, is  how a mere handful of the crew managed to survive for about 3 months at  sea. Finally, we hear about the consequences of the ordeal to the survivors  and the degeneration of Nantucket into a tourist trap.<br />  The familiar  actor Edward Herrmann reads the text with an almost clinical objectivity, a  very good idea in that it makes the third section easier to hear. All in  all, this is a classic example of reality being stranger than fiction and  of the almost mythic drive that keeps some people alive under the most  adverse circumstances. I should mention that the inclusion of scientific  research into the narrative is most helpful and adds greatly to our  understanding of what those men went through.<br />  A highly recommended  listen...but be prepared for that third section!	2000-05-15

Douglas' &lt;Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination&gt; (Times Books, 1999) is no mere history of radio. It was triggered by a request from the Sloan Foundation that was preparing  a series of books on technology and American culture; and the emphasis is  not on the details but on the general effect radio has on us from its  beginnings. And take another note. This is too enjoyable a read to be  considered a textbook.<br />  My favorite chapter was the one called  &quot;Radio Comedy and Linguistic Slapstick.&quot; Here only a few comics  are used as examples to support her several theses, one of which is the  emasculation of the American male by the use of such high-pitched speakers  as Jack Benny and Joe Penner. Of course there is lots of room for argument,  but she does let the facts speak for themselves (pun intended).<br />  The  other chapters are &quot;The Zen of Listening,&quot; &quot;The Ethereal  World,&quot; &quot;Exploratory Listening in the 1920s,&quot; &quot;Tuning  In to Jazz&quot; &quot;The Invention of the Audience,&quot; &quot;World War  II and the Invention of Broadcast Journalism,&quot; &quot;Playing Fields of  the Mind,&quot; &quot;The Kids Take Over: Transistors, DJs, and Rock 'n'  Roll,&quot; &quot;The FM Revolution,&quot; &quot;Talk Talk,&quot; &quot;Why  Ham Radio Matters,&quot; and &quot;Conclusion: Is Listening Dead?&quot;<br />  Which of us has not been affected in many of the ways Ms. Douglas points  out in this book?

Perhaps the abridgment left out--as abridgments should--the lesser compelling passages  and a perhaps an actor with less skill than Tim Pigott-Smith would have  made it a bit duller; but as it stands this recording makes for some fine  escapist listening on long car rides or periods of confinement or  R&amp;R.<br />  On the other hand, things began to pall after several tape  sides. I was reminded strongly of The Iliad in which one battle follows  another and the authors are hard pressed to find some variety in the  proceedings. For all I know, each confrontation in this book is  historically accurate. Credulity is strained, however, when storms of  bullets all miss and guns jam when a line of nuns is being fired upon.  Perhaps, again, the incident actually happened. But things in a book must  seem real, historical accuracy notwithstanding.<br />  Were all the  non-Jewish opponents so thoroughly evil as they are portrayed here? Again I  have to reserve judgment, not knowing what really happened. But a reader  must be led to believe the truth of what happens on the pages; and I just  was not fully convinced.

The first  is &lt;Opening Night on Broadway&gt; which covers 1943-1964 and the sequel, which deals with 1965-81. These are compilations  of what the major New York music critics had to say about the openings of  every important show on or just Off-Broadway plus the author's comments  about each. These books are very readable and an invaluable document of  American musical history. Now Mr. Suskin has given us an equally valuable  reference tool, but this is more to be used than to be read for  enjoyment.<br />  The third edition of his &lt;Show Tunes&gt; (Oxford  University Press, 2000) is an encyclopedia of facts about the composers of  the shows dealt with in the other volumes. The organization is like this.  After several introductory pages, we are given facts about the composers of  the early years from Jerome Kern to Harold Rome, new composers of the 40s  and 50s, and those of the 60s and beyond. Having dealt with what Suskin  considers (mostly rightly) to be the major composers, he then devotes the  fourth part of the volume to &quot;Notable scores by other composers&quot;:  &quot;Irene,&quot; &quot;Shuffle Along,&quot; &quot;Hair,&quot; and so on  up to &quot;Parade.&quot;<br />  Then comes a feature or two, which to  students of the American musical like myself, are almost worth the price of  the book alone. There is a year by year listing of all the major Broadway  productions from 1904-1998, a list of all people who collaborated on the  shows (George Abbott, Guy Bolton, etc.), an index of song titles, and  finally an index of show titles. Talk about user friendly!<br />  Turning  back to the main section and taking Gershwin as an example, Suskin gives us  in chronological order facts about each of the shows from 1916 to a 1951  production that used Gershwin's music. For each, he lists all the published  songs, indicates which were dropped by opening night, and gives some  general comments about the show itself. Then he ends with an evaluation of  Gershwin's Broadway output in general.<br />  Concise, accurate (as far as  I can see), beautifully organized.

Yes, all the composers whose works were to be found on CDs were included, but not every recording of every one of their works. The editors allowed themselves a  good deal of leeway in exercising their personal choices. Now the  &lt;Gramophone Classical Good CD Guide 2000&gt; has dropped a few features  found in the older editions and has lessened its value as a reference  tool--but to be fair, it must be judged on what is has retained.<br />  Its  chief rival is, of course, the &quot;Penguin Guide to Compact Discs,&quot;  which in its last edition has dropped the section on compilations and  concert recordings (except for piano recitals) but which still tries to  cram in reviews of every version of a work that is still available on the  major labels. Therefore, out of necessity, it has to say less about each  than does the Gramophone listings. And if, as at least one reader has  pointed out, the bias seems to Anglophiliac, one can take that into account  in making up one's own mind about which CD to purchase. And I do appreciate  the section that reviews collections, no longer to be found, as I said, in  the Penguin guides.<br />  What I do is get both of them whenever they come  out and keep even the old ones to double check on reissues and on what I  can find in used CD bins. So I will deduct a star for what is not there;  but I still want to recommend the Gramophone as very useful when used in  conjunction with the other guides.	2000-04-02

Therefore I very much like the &lt;Gramophone Musicals Good CD Guide&gt; (Gramophone Publications Limited, 1998) with its 264 pages of  comments about just about every Broadway show ever committed to CDs. Where  there are several versions, the editors have selected either all or some,  in the latter case referring us to a list of &quot;Also available&quot;  recordings. Therefore this guide makes no pretense to being complete in any  sense.<br />  Nevertheless it is quite valuable for what it does review.  There remains the question of what is not. Although I debate the inclusion  of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan into &quot;musicals,&quot; I do think that as  long as they are included, more of the available recordings should get full  treatment and not merely listed as &quot;also available.&quot; Another  problem is that many CDs available only in Great Britain are included and  given glowing reviews, increasing my frustration level greatly.<br />  On  the positive side, the guide is organized by composer in alphabetical order  with a short biography before the reviews proper; and there is an index of  shows in alphabetical order to make life easier. (How many musicals are  there with composers whose names spring to mind?) I also appreciate having  the timings for each CD, which allows us to pass up an expensive import  that runs (say) only 35 minutes. I like reading about the concert entries  such as the &quot;Kiri Sings ...&quot; series and the soundtracks such as  that of the 1946 &quot;Ziegfeld Follies.&quot;  Yes, their use of  &quot;musicals&quot; is not limited to stage presentations, and includes  screen versions of musicals as well as compilations such as &quot;Lullaby  of Broadway&quot; that offers up selections from Busby Berkeley films.And  for those who already own earlier editions, each new review is labeled as  such.<br />  So like its big brother, &quot;The Gramophone Classical Good CD  Guide,&quot; this is not a perfect but a very useful tool for the  collector.

I began by liking this audio version of  Jack Higgins &lt;Day of Reckoning&gt; very much, mostly because of the pleasant reading--nay, dramatization--of Patrick Macnee. I am particularly fond of mysteries or  adventure tales that concern detailed and elaborate step by step plans to  accomplish this or that goal. For example, the Poirot mystery &quot;The ABC  Murders&quot; or &quot;The Great Train Robbery.&quot; On top of that, they  are great fun.<br />  The work under scrutiny here, however, takes itself  very seriously--which is certainly laudable--and starts interestingly  enough when the Good Guys decide upon a campaign to wipe out the Bad Guys.  The problem is that so many sidestreets are entered that the artistic  pattern of the story is pretty much lost half way through. Now this would  be no Bad Thing if it weren't for the fact that the characters are not only  uninteresting but even the Good Guys are pretty unpleasant people.  Consequently I would never recommend this book as a good read.<br />  On the  other hand, Macnee is so good at his reading, despite the silly inclusion  of sound effects, and so multi-voiced as he lets each character speak in a  different voice (so far as is reasonable, that is) that I would be willing  to give the AUDIO version four stars instead of the three I would give the  book itself.

On the other hand, the recent recording in the Arkangel  Complete Shakespeare series is certainly much more dramatic and seems to  move a little faster, although the timings are pretty much the same. (And  it is on two tapes, contrasted with the 3 used by Harper.)<br />  Paul Jesson  might sound a little old for the role--it is hard to forget Burton--but he  throws himself into things, building a character that to modern tastes is  not all as admirable as Shakespeare's audience might have found him. But  being available as it has in an election year, it is good to have a play  about a candidate who will not degrade himself or tells lies before the  voters!<br />  Margorie Yates makes an impressive Volumnia. The Menenius of  Ewan Hooper strikes just that right tone as a man who can sway a mob with a  well-wrought anecdote based on an analogy that really does not match the  social crisis at hand but sounds as if it does. Again, more political  pre-echoes of today's urban problems.<br />  The character of Aufidius leaves  a lot to the director or actor to build upon. Just how happy is he at first  to receive his greatest foe as an ally; just how much does he agree at  first with Coriolanus' decision to spare Rome; just how &quot;struck with  sorrow&quot; is he at the very end? I suppose in a stage performance, a lot  of body motion can resolve the ambiguity. On this recording, it is very  hard to tell what this pivotal character really feels.<br />  But all in all,  this is a superior recording--and while it will not replace the older set,  it certainly deserves a worthy place beside it.	2000-03-13

Whenever a new one appears, I obtain my copy of &lt;The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs: the Guide to Excellence in Recorded Classical Music&gt;, check out new recordings of my favorite composers, and keep it on my shelf  with all the old ones that contain reviews of CDs no longer in print and  therefore deleted from the latest edition. From its modest beginnings when  there were only LPs and not many of those, this Guide has had to grow  almost unreasonably large to accommodate what is available on CDs, so that  a yearbook and a companion Guide had to be issued to update things.<br />  The latest edition has 1639 pages, and even with that the editors have had  to drop the end-section that used to contain reviews of CDs with programs  by many composers, leaving only recordings of piano recitals in this  edition. Some have found that the reviews  favor British productions  perhaps a bit more than they deserve, but that is a matter of opinion. An  editor's note informs us that &quot;we still only have space to consider  the very finest, irrespective of price&quot;; and we are referred to  &quot;The Penguin Guide to Bargain Compact Discs&quot; for further  listings.<br />  The arrangement of pieces by a composer like Mozart or  Beethoven is well done by listing, in order something like this, his  miscellaneous orchestral works, concerti, symphonies, chamber works, solo  works, vocal non-operatic, operas, collections. Thus it is fairly easy to  find what you are looking for. At any rate, despite some flaws--and they  are well documented by the other reviewers on this page--this Guide has  kept me many a time from wasting my money on inferior recordings; and for  that alone I give it a 5-star rating.	2000-03-12

Then came the  better-paced Shakespeare Recording Society with Anthony Quayle and Pamela  Brown, recently reissued on cassettes by Harper Audio. And now we have the  liveliest of them all as part of the Arkangel Complete Shakespeare Series,  issued by Penguin Books this side of the Atlantic.<br />  With the older set  long out of print, the Arkangel certainly has the most appeal to modern  listeners, giving as it does less a reading than the sounds of an actual  production. The Antony of Ciaran Hinds does not quite come up to the  poetical reading that is Quayle's, while Estelle Kohler's Queen of the Nile  is a bit juicier than  the more dryly delivered one of Brown. But both  partners are really fabulous on their own terms and both performances are  well worth having side by side in your collection.<br />  The Arkangel set  does make some strange use of regional accents. Perhaps they are strange  only to American ears (viz., mine), but it continues to be a bit jarring to  hear Scottish accents on Roman soldiers. On the other hand, the use of  Cockney for the lower classes has become an accepted tradition on British  recordings, so perhaps we can grow accustomed to anything, given enough  time and understanding.<br />  Teachers should take note, however, that  classes will probably respond better to this new, more dramatized version  despite a little loss in the grand old style of poetic declamation.	2000-03-06

Well, just in perfect timing with the new motion picture version of the play, we now have from  Penguin's Arkangel  Complete Shakespeare series, a very serious rival to  the older set.<br />  The Harper set is perfectly fine with stylized readings  in old fashioned manner (what else can one do with a script like this one?)  that milks what little poetry there is in this play for all it is worth.  The &quot;star&quot; of the show is Anthony Quayle, whose Aaron the Moor  just stops at going &quot;over the top&quot; in his last scenes.<br />  The  Arkangel set gives us Paterson Joseph in that role, whose  &quot;ethnic&quot; voice never overstates any of the lines and who whispers  where Quayle chortles in his joy. David Troughton plays the title role,  trying (it seems to me) to make the character believable in a voice that  seems just a tad young after hearing the venerable Michael Hodern in the  earlier recording. In doing so, he loses some of the feeling for the meter  but I think he succeeds very well on his own terms.<br />  For once, the rape  scene is as harrowing on a sound recording as it ever was on stage, thanks  to the Director eliciting the most horrible screams from poor Lavinia (Emma  Gregory), whose voice is then written out of the script. The evil Queen of  the Goths (Harriet Walter) sounds like the mother of those two monster sons  (John McAndrew and Charles Simpson); while the rest of the cast is never  less than good.<br />  The only (to me) jarring feature is the use of an  organ, which (1) is too anachronistic and (2) makes us think unfortunately  of the silent movie melodramas that this play can so closely resemble. I  will keep playing both sets in the future, but this one has a bit more  excitement while the other has a bit more of the poetry. Both are quite  valid and this play does deserve something of a respectful resurrection  that the film might bring about and these two sets will help considerably.esurrection  that the film might bring about and these two sets will help considerably.	2000-03-06

In the beginning, Timon is (not to put too fine a point on it) stupidly philanthropic; in the end he is equally misanthropic. When Timon is on top of the world, we have the  cynical Apemantus to be our voice and let him know what a fool he is. In  the last two acts, we simply wish (I do, at least) that our hero would stop  complaining and let us &quot;pass and stay not here,&quot; as he would have  all men do in his epitaph.<br />  But a recording is to be judged on its  performances, not so much on its text. The Arkangel series, now in its last  laps toward completion before (I am told) it is all redone on CDs, has  every reason to be proud of its &quot;Timon of Athens,&quot; thanks to its  strong and intelligent readings. The opening scenes of artisans and poets  building up the play's themes of wheel-of-fortune and gratitude/ingratitude  are almost intelligible without a text open before you. Alan Howard, whom I  saw in New York long ago as Henry V and as the main character in  &quot;Good,&quot; has that kind of friendly voice that is so well suited to  the extravagant Timon in the open acts that we feel all the more for him  when his false friends deny him in his need.<br />  The snarling voice of  Norman Rodway's Apemantus is a perfect counterpoint, and he casts out his  invective in those early scenes with a hint of humor. However, when Timon  becomes the misanthrope, his voice darkens and coarsens; and it is very  hard to tell it from Apemantus' in their overly-long exchange of curses in  4:3. If the actor playing Alcibiades (Damian Lewis) sounds far too young  for the role, that is a minor quibble--and perhaps the director wanted him  to sound like a young Timon.<br />  The incidental music sounds  sufficiently Greek but too modern; still, Ingratitude knows no particular  time period. A superior production of a much flawed play and a very welcome  addition to any collection of recorded drama, especially since the old  Decca set is long out of print and Harper audio does not yet have a  &quot;Timon&quot; in their series.elcome  addition to any collection of recorded drama, especially since the old  Decca set is long out of print and Harper audio does not yet have a  &quot;Timon&quot; in their series.	2000-02-24

WhenCyrano tells Christian to &quot;climb&quot; up to the arms of Roxane, we can assume he does so and a few discreet grunts would help. But when Hamlet stages a dumb show for Claudius and all the court, different directors of recorded versions treat the problem differently.<br /> One or two recordings leave it out and skip directly to the spoken &quot;Mouse Trap,&quot; while at least one I have heard has some music playing and the court reacting audibly to whatever is supposed to be happening. Well, I was most impressed in the Arkangel audio edition of &lt;Hamlet&gt; when Shakespeare's stage directions concerning the dumb show were read by Hamlet as dialogue. This works just fine and I cannot conceive any future recording doing it any other way. The exchange of rapiers during the duel, however, is not at all clear without having a text open before you. (In the Branagh recording, a line is inserted to tell us the weapons are switched.)<br /> The intelligence with which that dumb show is handled made me very favorably disposed to this set that is cast strongly with Jane Lapotaire (Gertrude), Imogene Stubbs (Ophelia), Bob Peck (Claudius), and Norman Rodway (Polonius). However (oh, dear), when it comes to the Hamlet of Simon Russell Beale, I must back off just a little.<br /> I find his reading much better than the dry recital of Paul Scofield on the Harper Audio version, less flexible than Brannagh's on the Bantam set, and far less poetical than Gielgud on the long out of print RCA Victor version from the 1950s. Whether by personal choice or director's mandate, this is somewhat monochromatic Hamlet: angry and intense. Too many of his lines are read between strong inhalations, as if he is trying to cope with his emotions--which indeed Hamlet is. Towards the end of the play, he seems to loosen up and actually manages a vocal smile as he tells Horatio about how he forged the letter that sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to their deaths.Do not missunderstand! What he does he does very well. My point is that he does not explore all the facets of the character as well as some of the rival Hamlets.<br /> Although timed at 3 hours, 25 minutes, the entire play is on two cassettes (as opposed to the four for the Scofield version and for the Branagh) and modestly priced. So despite my minor reservations, this is for me the &quot;Hamlet&quot; of choice.tio about how he forged the letter that sends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to their deaths.Do not missunderstand!

But what they did,  they did for the most part well. The original theater company that did  &quot;Lysistrata&quot; would have welcomed them, as would some medieval  troupes that toured the provences with less than high-tone routines.<br />Mr.  Fleming's book was given to me as a Christmas gift from my daughter on New  Year's Eve, just in time for me to start taping AMC's Three Stooges  marathon. Since a good percent of this book is a series of resumes of each  Stooge short from the very first &quot;Woman Haters&quot; to the 190th  &quot;Sappy Bullfighters,&quot; this gift could not have been more  opportune. (Would you believe that each episode has appended to it a count  of how many slaps, head conks, and pie throwing took place in each film?)  This section provides me with a wonderful checklist to see which ones I am  still missing.<br />But even before that, we have the wonderful account of how  these three/four got to be the mainstay of the Columbia lot and how they  kept that position without ever knowing about it, since their bosses kept  their value a secret from them.<br />The saddest part is certainly the section  about Curley's growing deterioration leading up to his collapse in the film  #97 and Shemp's replacing him in film #98.<br />The only error I can find  (other than a disputed number of pies thrown in an episode here and there)  is misnaming &quot;Mutts to You&quot; as &quot;Nuts to You.&quot;<br />So if  this topic is for you, this book certainly is.

Some involve more complex plots and/or ideas and take more concentration than is safe when driving. I suppose tapes have to be judged by slightly different  standards than the books on which they based. A book like &lt;Secret  Honor&gt; has so many characters, so many plot threads and twists, that the  listener wishes he could look back to remind himself about who a person is  or what event is being referred to. Even in its abridged format (6 hours),  this novel is pretty involved.  Frankly I began to give up half way  through. I did like the reader however, and the sporadic use of background  music and some sound effects helped somewhat. The plot began very nicely,  holding my interest, but then too many things began to happen--and none of  them were particularly exciting--to characters with whom I felt little or  no sympathy. For those who like this author or sprawling spy novels, this  tape is recommended.	2000-01-30

I am unfamiliar with any of these books  and my only exposure has been the Putnam Berkley Audio taped abridgment of  the Braun mystery.<br />Although it is nicely read by George Guidall, I found  it difficult to get enthusiastic over the offering as a whole. Small town  character novels are always interesting, provided that the characters are  interesting in themselves.Here I could not get involved with any of them,  possibly because of my unfamiliarity with the earlier works. Of course the  gimmick is the ESP of Koko and YumYum, the two cats that sense what has  really happened and provide all the clues. Were this treated as pure  fantasy, the gimmick would work. Here, despite all the disclaimers about  how little we know about the thoughts of cats, credulity is strained past  the limit of what a realistic novel should expect of the reader.<br />  Very  likely I would have liked it more if I read the complete novel; but this is  a review of the recording.<br />  Mind you, this tape will still provide some  pleasant listening on a long drive--but do no expect too much.	2000-01-29

Having as its only competition the CD and cassette re-release by  Harper Collins Audio of the old Caedmon set with Rex Harrison and Rachel  Roberts, this is a far better recording as regards sound and (I feel)  a  lot livelier acting that makes the lines easier to follow without a text  open in one's hand.<br />Saskia Reeves' Beatrice is on a par with that of  Roberts, as indeed are the rest of the cast with their corresponding actors  in the older set. The question remains as to whether one prefers Harrison's  more comic approach or Samuel West's more masculine one. For me the  touchstone has always been the &quot;Kill Claudio&quot; sequence after the  abortive wedding. In the Caedmon set, the director allows (or instructs)  Harrison to toss off his refusal so that all the dramatic tension is gone.  Here the moment is treated somewhat better, although I still feel so much  more could be made of it.<br />  An interesting interpretation in this  Arkangel set is that the singer of &quot;Sigh no more ladies,&quot; for all  his protests that he is a poor singer, actually IS one! In a way, it is a  shame since the song is a lovely one (though not sung to the more familiar  melody in this production); but this is a comic moment and they are priming  Benedick for the Big Deception.<br />As I always suggest with these rival  versions, every English and Drama Department should have both sets and let  the students decide. But this is an excellent purchase, unless you love  Rex!	2000-01-14

Co-authored by Shakespeare and Fletcher, this play remains an odd man out  for several reasons. Based fairly closely on the &quot;Knight's Tale&quot;  from Chaucer's &quot;Canterbury Tales,&quot; it tells of two cousins, who  just after swearing eternal friendship in one of Duke Theseus' prisons  immediately fall in love with the same woman, Emilia, and become bitter  rivals for her affections. One of them, Arcite, is exiled but returns in  disguise; the other, Palamon, escapes with the help of the Jailer's  Daughter, who goes mad for love of him; and...well, see for yourself.  Of  the play's 23 scenes, 7 and part of an 8th are attributed to Shakespeare, a  9th doubtfully so, and the rest to John Fletcher, who was probably handed  over to Shakespeare to learn the ropes as it were. The Shakespeare parts  are easy to spot: they are nearly impossible to understand without a  heavily annotated copy of the text open before you! Even more so than in  his late plays like &quot;Cymberline&quot; and &quot;Winter's Tale,&quot;  the syntax is so complex, the thoughts so condensed, that one might (and  has) compared his writing with the late Beethoven String Quartets.  As  one of the scholars quoted in the excellent Signet Classic paperback  edition of this play comments, the play is most unShakespearean  in that  none of the characters change over the course of the play. And I should add  the subplot of the Daughter's madness is never integrated into the main  plot. One scene, in fact, is devoted entirely to the description of some  minor characters and might have been influenced by a similar and much  longer sequence in &quot;Seven Against Thebes.&quot;  In short, do not  play this for a casual listen; but be prepared to be challenged. Look  especially for echoes of the earlier all-Shakespearean plays. The nuptials  of Theseus and Hippolyta recall the opening scenes of &quot;A Midsummer  Night's Dream,&quot; the main plot that of &quot;Two Gentlemen of  Verona,&quot; the Daughter's madness of Ophelia, and so on.  As for the  actual recording, it would be difficult to better it! The voices of the two  kinsmen (Johnathan Firth and Nigel Cooke) are easily distinguishable,  Theseus (Geoffrey  Whitehead) sounds advanced in years and noble, Emila  (Helen Schlesinger) mature and alert, Hippolyta (Adjoa Andoh) vocally of  African origins as perhaps befits the character, and all the rest as  understandable as the text allows and &quot;into&quot; their roles.

So I once  saw Caesar shot to death by 1930-senators and then heard characters speak  of the &quot;daggers&quot; that stabbed Caesar. Now, the Arkangel  production of &lt;The Two Gentlemen of Verona&gt; is one of the best acted  in the series so far. The gentlemen (Michael Maloney and Damian Lewis) and  their beloveds (Saskia Wickham and Lucy Robinson) are nicely differentiated  in voice and delivery, Thorio (Desmond Barrit) appropriately obnoxious, and  Launce (John Woodvine) sufficiently earthy to convince us that they are  &quot;into their roles&quot; and convince us that all this silliness is  important to them. (The Dog, however, is rotten.)<br />Take for example the  giggling and the &quot;girl talk&quot; between Julia and her maid as they  joke about the cod piece that will be a part of the disguise. And yet at  every turn--indeed even as background to several scenes--we have a 1960s  lounge combo, saxophone very prominent, displacing us to a time when the  very expression &quot;cod piece&quot; needs a footnote.  And what should be  the most beautiful moment in the play--and hear it on the rival Harper  Collins Audio version to see if I am not wrong--is the lovely &quot;Who is  Sylvia,&quot; here sung in a horrible jazzy version totally out of keeping  with the language, morals, and what we imagine in our minds to be the  costumes. Why, in heaven's sake, should an audio recording have to  misdirect us like this? In the Arkangel edition of &quot;All's Well That  Ends Well,&quot; we are greeted by the sound of a modern piano and actually  hear a train pulling out of station later on! Well, in this case there was  a stage production a few years earlier that did indeed set the play in a  recent era. But on a tape recording...?<br />  Yes, I still give this recording  4 stars for the sake of the excellent cast and their director.

What turned me off right off the bat was the  scatology that so many writers deem absolutely necessary to succeed in a  novel or script today. Having been a teacher for too many years and having  grown quite fed up with language pollution in the young and the mis-called  &quot;mature adult,&quot; I find myself avoiding like the plague all  company--in real life or on the printed page--that has an arsenal of  adjectives limited to variations on two or three words. And I do not buy  the argument that asserts &quot;but that's the way people really  talk.&quot;<br />  Now for what I like very much about this novella.  It is  a combination of the ancient epic of &quot;Gilgamesh&quot; (why must men  die?), the &quot;Odyssey&quot; (a series of harrowing adventures leading to  self-awareness), &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; (male bonding), and  &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; (incipient author learns  about life). Add to that list any of the thousands that fit the bill, and  you have a very derivative work. But so is &quot;Hamlet&quot; and therefore  the derivations are not necessarily a Bad Thing.<br />  The youngsters who  take the Great Journey to find the corpse that gives this work its title  are not particularly desirable beings; but King is careful to show how  little choice they had in their development up to that point in their  lives. On the other hand, they are utterly believable, which puts them many  notches above characters in other King novels, let alone most novels by any  author. Some of the incidents--the one with Chopper the dog who does not  live up to his myth and the one with Lardass who deliberately loses a  pie-eating contest in a very Monty Pythonesque way--are hysterically funny,  almost in a Jean Shepherd vein.<br />Frank Muller gives a very sympathetic  reading.

Not only is their  catalogue bursting with individual programs, but they have boxed sets of 60  shows each on 20 cassettes packaged by type: science fiction, detective,  comedy, and so on.  Their latest offering in that format is titled &lt;The  60 Greatest Old-Time Radio Shows of the 20th Century&gt; -- and lest one  exclaim &quot;Sez who?&quot; the rest of the title is &quot;Selected by  Walter Cronkite.&quot; Of course, we cannot be sure if he chose each  episode personally. The box tells us that &quot;Radio Spirits has  teamed&quot; with him in the selection. For some of these choices, I fell  into violent disagreement with the use of &quot;greatest&quot;; but all in  all this is as remarkable a collection as are the earlier releases and  quite different from them in one important respect.  Several of the shows  are highly poetical and designed to help audiences through the war and  postwar years back in the 1940s. The one called &quot;We Hold These  Truths&quot; gives us Jimmy Stewart in a Norman Corwin tribute to the Bill  of Rights, while Orson Welles intones the purple prose of Corwin's  &quot;Fourteen August.&quot; I found a salute to Carl Sandburg somewhat  overlong. However Corwin's &quot;The Undecided Molecule&quot; is not only  all in verse and truly funny, but features Robert Benchley and Groucho Marx  among several other stars.  Of course Cronkite would include a full  Walter Winchell broadcast when a few seconds' sample would have sufficed,  and the Vic and Sade episode chosen is particularly vapid. (Were they all  like that,  can some reader tell me?) But choosing the Abbott and Costello  show that has not only the &quot;Who's on First&quot; but also the  &quot;Bob Feller&quot; routine  was right on target, as was the Edgar  Bergen/Charlie McCarthy show in which Mae West got herself banned from the  air for her suggestive reading of Eve in a sketch in which Don Ameche plays  Adam.  Other highlights are the &quot;Sorry, Wrong Number&quot; with  Agnes Moorehead (&quot;Suspense&quot;) and the same author's &quot;The  Hitchhiker&quot; with Orson Welles (&quot;Mercury Summer Theater&quot;).  Mr. Welles' famous Mercury Theater &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; is the  first selection, by the way, to be matched in terror only by &quot;Three  Skeleton Key&quot; (&quot;Escape&quot;) in which  Vincent Price and two men  are trapped in a lighthouse by millions of rats! Or the classic  &quot;Leinengen vs. the Ants&quot; (&quot;Escape&quot;) in which William  Conrad defies several square miles of the man-eaters.  For comedy we  have Baby Snooks, Fibber McGee and Molly, Burns and Allen, Jack Benny, Fred  Allen, Desi and Lucy (with the Mertz's), Eddie Cantor, Bob Hope and Bing  Crosby (in a particular funny Philco Radio Time Episode), and a host of  comics in a Dick Tracy spoof on a &quot;Command Performance&quot; designed  for GI's overseas.  For drama we have, among many, the science fiction  &quot;Nightfall&quot; (&quot;X-Minus One&quot;) the western &quot;From Here  to Boston&quot; (&quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot;) the mystery &quot;The  Death Bed Caper&quot; (&quot;Sam Spade, Detective&quot;) the suspenseful  &quot;The Shadow of Death&quot; (&quot;Inner Sanctum&quot;) and the  speculative &quot;Brave New World&quot; (&quot;The CBS Radio  Workshop&quot;).  (I regret I simply do not have the space to list them  all, but you can contact me for more details.)  Different from the other  sets is the format that mixes 60 and 90 minute shows with shorter ones, so  that an entire tape can be devoted to a sequence of &quot;Johnny  Dollar&quot; episodes. But you still get 60 shows, if each episode counts  as one! As I said when I reviewed some of the earlier releases, this is a  terrific educational tool if used correctly. The Billof Rights broadcast,  for example, would do a better job letting the young know about those  original 10 amendments than any textbook could. And think what a teacher  could do in having a class write its own radio show after hearing some of  these! I believe there is a CD version available, but I find CDs leave out  the commercials to make room on a side that cannot hold more than 79  minutes. But in either format, this collection (as are the others, of  course) is a most enjoyable, if not a most valuable, set to have and to  play many times.

Frankly as  I heard the cassette, as well-read as it was, my interest began to wane  into the second of the four tapes; and I began to wonder why this should  be.<br />None of the characters are particularly interesting or even  believable. Now for a work of action-adventure fiction, credibility can go  by the board. Does anyone really believe that James Bond can do all the  things Flemming has him do?  But Bond is interesting, he is funny, he is  semi-mythical in a way that this hero simply is not.<br />Secondly the plot  seems put together of shreds and patches from other works. Being trapped by  water in a supposedly sealed room and being rescued at the last instant is  strictly Indiana Jones, while the Fourth Empire is nothing but the evil  organization that first showed up in &quot;Thunderball,&quot; and the  ancient runes in the ruins find their origin in &quot;She.&quot; And so  on.<br />The story told on this tape is well-wrought--the author knows what he  is about as a craftsman--but it offers nothing at all new to the genre; and  what is old is not all that well done. Perhaps reading the book would  produce a totally different estimation. But nothing I heard makes me feel  the urge to do so.	1999-12-15

So the thrill I got was boundless from listening to the 30 hours in the boxed set of 20 cassettes titled CBS's 60  Greatest Old-Time Radio Shows.    Put out by Radio Spirits  (1-800-723-4648), these classic shows can be sorted into the following  categories:    COMEDY: Amos `n' Andy, Baby Snooks, Blondie, Burns and  Allen, Charlie McCarthy, Danny Kaye, Fred Allen, Jack Benny....     MYSTERY:  Philip Marlowe, Sam Spade, Broadway is My Beat, Crime Classics, Gang  Busters, Mr Keen....    WESTERNS: Frontier Gentleman, Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will  Travel....    DRAMA: CBS Radio Workshop, Dr. Christian, Escape....    VARIETY:  Songs by Sinatra, Bing Crosby Chesterfield Show....  I only wish this column  had room to list them all.     A very special appeal this collection has is  the inclusion of shows not represented in other collection: It Pays to be  Ignorant, Honest Harold, Tales of Fatima, and others.     The years spanned  in this collection are 1939 to 1958. With their usual consideration, Radio  Spirits has included a thick booklet that first tells the story of how CBS  became the giant of the airwaves and then gives a detailed rundown of the  each of the 60 shows included on the tapes. Included are photos of the  stars, the names of the cast where the information was available, a brief  description of the program on the tape, and a history of the program from  its inception.    Unlike the CD collections that are also in the Radio  Spirits catalogue, three full shows can be accommodated on a single 90  minute tape (you have to turn the tape in the middle of the second show, of  course); and so you get all the commercials too. Some of them are as much  fun as the show itself.    There are several other boxed sets of equal  excellence that concentrate on comedy shows or detective shows. However  this set offers enough variety to keep you happy for many miles of driving(which is how I get to hear most of this material) or of relaxing at home.      I can say no more. The proof of the pudding will be in the listening.	1999-12-12

Not only is their catalogue bursting with individual programs, but they have boxed sets of 60  shows each on 20 cassettes packaged by type: science fiction, detective,  comedy, and so on.  <br /> Their latest offering in that format is titled  &lt;The 60 Greatest Old-Time Radio Shows of the 20th Century&gt; -- and  lest one exclaim &quot;Sez who?&quot; the rest of the title is  &quot;Selected by Walter Cronkite.&quot; Of course, we cannot be sure if he  chose each episode personally. The box tells us that &quot;Radio Spirits  has teamed&quot; with him in the selection. For some of these choices, I  fell into violent disagreement with the use of &quot;greatest&quot;; but  all in all this is as remarkable a collection as are the earlier releases  and quite different from them in one important respect.<br />   Several of the  shows are highly poetical and designed to help audiences through the war  and postwar years back in the 1940s. The one called &quot;We Hold These  Truths&quot; gives us Jimmy Stewart in a Norman Corwin tribute to the Bill  of Rights, while Orson Welles intones the purple prose of Corwin's  &quot;Fourteen August.&quot; I found a salute to Carl Sandburg somewhat  overlong.

Of course, many consider &quot;Titus  Andronicus&quot; a perversion anyway; and to tell the truth, I do get a  little queasy during the various mutilations that make the deaths at the  end a relief rather than a shock.  But accepting the play on its own  terms, you will find the reissue on tape of the 1966 Caedmon recording of  &lt;Titus Andronicus&gt; (CF 277) possibly the best directed of the entire  classic series. Howard Sackler has a bunch of professionals on  hand and he  lets them (with one exception) tear up the scenery. Poor Judy Dench, who  has so little to say as Lavinia before the plot makes her say no more, can  only make pathetic noises for most of the play until her final death cry.  The evil brothers, played here by John Dane and Christopher Guinee, are not  only evil but sarcastically so--and this works on a recording as it might  not on the stage.  Perhaps Maxine Audley's Tamora is a bit too Wicked  Witch of the West now and then; but her co-partner in evil, Aron the Moor,  is brought to life by Anthony Quayle in a role he made famous on stage,  going even further in the outright enjoyment of his ill-doing. Yes, this  play can easily raise laughs and takes an Olivier to keep the audience in  the tragic mood. (Reports are that he did it so well that some audience  members became ill and had to leave.)<br />  Which brings us to Michael  Hordern's Titus. Hodern is a fine actor but not a great one. He suffers  well but not grandly. I am surprised that his Big Moment--&quot;I am the  sea&quot;--is lost among all the other images in that speech. But anyone  can direct someone else's play.  This recording, soon to be rivaled by  one in the Arkangel series, is definitely worth having for Quayle's  performance alone.	1999-11-25

First of all, the  Harper offering is available on cassette and on CD; the Arkangel only on  tape. Then the cast of the earlier recording, Michael Redgrave's Prospero  in particular, gives a  more poetic reading of the text--more of the old  school of declamation, don't you know, that pays equal attention to the  music of the words as to their meaning. Also the Caliban of Hugh Griffith  sound more &quot;in character&quot; than does the strangely accented  monster of Richard McCabe on the Arkangel. Bob Peck's Prospero on the newer  set is maturer, angrier, and as right in its way as was Redgrave's in his.  The older Ariel (Vanessa Redgrave) was more musical, this one (Adrian  Lester) stronger and therefore less pathetic. The rest of the two casts are  pretty equal, the newer ones profiting of course by better sound.  What  both sets need badly is a narrator to clarify what is happening during the  &quot;special effects&quot; scenes such as the banquet and the masque. I am  sure the listener will not be offended at a little &quot;outside the fourth  wall&quot; assistance.  Which one to pick? I would say that all English  and drama departments should have both. The beginner might prefer the new,  more vivid, albeit less poetical, Arkangel set.	1999-11-12
US	52047360	R23O5SRDMLVYZL	0878331638	841008378	The Alfred Hitchcock Story	Books	4	26	26	N	N	Excellent presentation, too little room to develop it	Reference books make great gifts because they can be pretty useful for years to come. Some of them are even attractive enough to leave out on coffee tables for guests to flip through when conversation drags.  &lt;The Alfred Hitchcock Story&gt; by Ken Mogg (Taylor Publishing Company,  1999) is probably the most attractively produced book on that much written  about director. It is well organized, each of the Master's films getting  anywhere from one to five or six pages, well illustrated, with several  specialized items to keep us abreast of trends in Hitch's career. For  example, there is a list of all his cameo appearances in his films, a brief  examination of his film techniques, his use of famous locations, and so on.  Especially welcome are little inserts of trivia, such as the story behind  the song the children are singing as The Birds are massing outside in the  playground, and a generous number of lobby card reproductions. There is  also a good discussion of his television series and even his paperback  anthologies. In short, Mr. Mogg does not concentrate entirely on the films,  although they do take up the bulk of the volume.  By the way, listing  Janet Leigh as co-author on this website is misleading: she only wrote a  one-page introduction that is quite amusing.  My only complaint is that  211 pages are not enough room to handle this wealth of material; and here  and there I feel much more of value could have been said had the author  been given more space. (Hence the one star less in my rating.) Still such a  comment merely shows how much I like this book and many of you will too.	1999-11-09

First there was W.S. Gilbert, who showed the way that intelligent lyrics need not be anathema to a light-hearted musical; and whose lyrics can stand as  independent poems. Afterwards we had P.G. Wodehouse, Cole Porter, Noel  Coward, Ira Gershwin--and the best of 'em all, Lorenz Hart.<br />Not only is  what he says witty but how he says it is even wittier. There is no room  here to give examples of his incredible rhymes. But turn to the single  example of &quot;To Keep My Love Alive&quot; which might be the very last  set of lyrics he wrote before a lifetime of alcohol finally took its toll;  and then compare it with any Gilbert's &quot;list&quot; songs to see the  genius of this artist.<br />On an other level, any student of psychology will  pounce upon the self-lacerating images conjured up in his &quot;love&quot;  songs. Because of his own physical problems, we have &quot;My Funny  Valentine&quot; in which the love object is &quot;less than Greek&quot;  with a chin that's a little weak. And being in love is little more than  &quot;broken dates&quot; and &quot;flying plates.&quot;<br />His out and out  parodies rival Cole Porter's, as witness &quot;Way Out West on West End  Avenue&quot; with its kitchen range and so on. And all this is helped by  his &quot;signature&quot; trick of breaking up words in the middle to get  rhymes like  &quot;Summer journeys to Niagra/  And to other  places aggra-/  Vate, all our cares.&quot;<br />On the level of  Broadway musical history, the value of this collection speaks for itself,  especially with the fine photographs and annotations about every show and  then every song within the show. A scholarly masterpiece.<br />So how come you  don't have a copy?	1999-10-10

The Macbeth sounds never less than the perfect English gentleman and what we have is a very dignified reading of a play that should be  dripping with blood and shouted in thunder.

If for no other reason, it preserves the poetry of Shakespeare's lines far more than do any of the others, thanks  mostly to Anthony Quayle's reading. The rest of the cast are all veteran  classical actors who know what they are about. And thankfully the director  decided to forget about annoying Scottish accents!

Also I am not too sure the use of  Scottish accents helps in any way. You might argue it more  &quot;authentic&quot;; but how authentic is it to speak in iambic  pentameter? I own both versions and will switch between them. But my desert  island choice would be the one with Quayle.	1999-09-30

An encyclopedia should (as Sgt. Friday used to insist) just give the facts. Almost every  sentence here is concerned with Mr. Ross's personal opinion about the  facts--opinion, by the way, stated as fact. When he says, for example, that  episode 7 of the lst series of MP's Flying Circus is &quot;one of the most  unfunny,&quot; this can scarcely be accepted as fact (it is the one about  the transformation into Scotsmen). The format is also inconsistent. A  complete treatment of an Avengers episode is offered because John Cleese  makes a brief appearance but another episode in which Carol Cleveland plays  a major role is not featured  and barely mentioned in her own write up.  Also--and this is a Good Thing--Ross includes any film or tv show in which  even a single Pythonite has had a hand. So with an eye open for typos and  occasional inaccuracies, I will continue to peruse this book but always  careful to separate fact from opinion. And all the more so now that the  MPFC tapes and DVDs are being made available by A&amp;E!	1999-09-22

Never mind if you consider the text as absolute historical truth, beautiful metaphor, or something between the  two. It would be very difficult to find a better reader than Sir John. His  voice shows every sign of age and that makes it sound just right. Also his  carefully cadenced reading brings out all the poetry inherent in the King  James translation of this material. An absolute Stunner! And an object  lesson in dramatic reading for our current crop of microphone-influenced  whisperers and mumblers.	1999-09-14

Some time ago after a meeting of some sort, I happened to call out, &quot;You've all done very well!&quot; and every person there laughed. If someone else ever uses the word &quot;bucket,&quot; all you have to do is  say &quot;Pronounced bouquet&quot; and very few will not get the reference.  Or a simple &quot;Nudge, nudge&quot; might get knowing chuckles. Now for  the very few of you who are wondering what that was all about, you have  obviously never seen (in order) &quot;Are YouBeing Served?&quot;  &quot;Keeping Up Appearances,&quot; or even &quot;Monty Python's Flying  Circus.&quot;  Although those three and many other exports from England  are so familiar, very few of us over here know anything of their  backgrounds. Well, the solution is now available from Taylor Publishing  Company. Garry Berman's &lt;Best of the Britcoms: from Fawlty Towers to  Absolutely Fabulous&gt; has just been issued.At $18.95 it is a goldmine of  information about three sorts of British comedies: (1) those you know and  love, (2) those you have known and loved but are not shown any more, and  (3) those very popular over there but never shown over here.  Of the  over 30 programs discussed in the all too few 140 pages (I only wish it was  longer) of this book, several are still around on the PBS stations other  than the three mentioned above: &quot;Red Dwarf,&quot; &quot;'Allo!  'Allo!,&quot; &quot;One Foot in the Grave,&quot; &quot;Waiting for  God,&quot; &quot;The Vicar of Dibley,&quot; and more. (&quot;Absolutely  Fabulous&quot; was a bit too much for Public TV and can be seen on the  Comedy Channel with lots of commercials.)  From the golden past we have  &quot;The Rise and Fall of Reginald Perrin,&quot; &quot;Butterflies,&quot;  &quot;Yes, Minister [and] Yes, Prime Minister,&quot; &quot;To the Manor  Born,&quot; &quot;The Black Adder,&quot; the fairly recent &quot;Thin Blue  Line,&quot; and others. As for those never seen in the Colonies, why don't  you just look for yourself? You will see a lot of familiar faces, mind you,  who went on to do things you have seen.  Each entry gives us the years it  was shown in Great Britain, and how many episodes were shown in all. You  are then given the writers, directors and producers; told if any of the  episodes are available on tape; and then you get the basic casts.

For example, we learn that the basic idea of the maniacally rude  Basil Fawlty (John Cleese) was based on an actual hotel owner at whose  establishment the Monty Python group once stayed. And that the very first  &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; episode was hurriedly put on the air in  1972 when a telecast of the Olympics was suddenly canceled because of the  massacre of the Israeli contestants.

Perry Keenlyside's &lt;The  Life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&gt; (NA 314412) is on three tapes or CDs  and more or less delivers what the title promises in about 3 hours and 40  minutes.

The narration and quotations from letters and journals of the  time are accompanied by the appropriate music drawn from the bottomless  Naxos catalogue.

The voices are personable, the information digestible, the whole project  very worth while, especially at the price.  Those last two sentences are  true for the other setsas well. Richard Fawke's &lt;The History of  Classical Music&gt; (NA414012) and &lt;The History of Opera&gt; (417612)  are both on 4 tapes or CDs and read solo by Robert Powell. I am afraid that  just a little five hours is not enough to handle the first topic with any  satisfying degree of completeness; but it does give a 'Monarch Notes&quot;  glance at an enormously wide and complicated topic and is just enough for  anyone who wants a head start before plunging into longer works. On the  other hand, I greatly enjoyed the Opera set, timed at only 5 minutes more  than the other recording. Trying to cover less, it does it better; and it  even has room for some amusing incidents such as the one about the famous  one-act opera that was entered into a contest (which it won) by the  composer's wife who had more faith in it than did the composer.

I want to point out its use as an  educational tool. Social Studies classes are all too often made boring by  reliance on textbooks (which are either outdated or too politically correct  to be of any use) or on films and tapes, which are better but still pretty  factual (whatever the bias) and dull to many students. I have always in my  classes used the music of the period to liven things up a bit; but what  about using radio broadcasts? Each one of them is a reflection of the  people and events that shaped these shows and so many of them are available  on tapes and CDs from such catalogues as Radio Spirits. &lt;On the Air&gt;  is a fantastic resource manual for a teacher who wants to see what is  appropriate for any particular class and to provide the background  information for the students. Oxford University Press might want to  consider this angle in their advertizing. But even all this aside, it does  make for some fascinating reading!	1999-08-27

As for the material itself, it is a superb &quot;beginner's  guide&quot; to the history of opera. Running just short of 320 minutes  (each CD is packed up to nearly the 80 minute limit), the not too  cultivated British voice of the narrator takes us through the stages of the  development of opera with copious illustrations drawn from the mammoth  Naxos catalogue. The information is beautifully organized and very very  clearly expressed. I transferred my CD copy to tape so I could hear it  several times while on the road and let the information sink in. There is a  Naxos set along the same lines that traces the history of all Western  music; but there I felt that 4 CDs were not enough. Here I congratulate  whoever did the abrigement for a fine job.	1999-08-16

This creaking plot might work in a good stage production; but although we know the first two acts, except for a line or two, to be by a hand other than Shakespeare's, the last three acts  are bargain basement stuff. Still this is as good a reading as we are  likely to get.  (The old, out of print version on London/Argo label was  quite eloquent.)  The best thing about this version is the God-like voice  of John Gielgud reading the narrator role of Gower. He sounds as ancient as  the character is supposed to be. An unfortunate directorial decision leaves  us without the &quot;dumb shows&quot; (which are simply read on the older  recording without apology). Nigel Terry (&quot;Excalibur&quot;) suffers  well as the Odysseus-like hero and the rest of the excellent cast try hard  to make things sound plausible.  The electronic music does not help  create any atmosphere but merely jars.	1999-06-24

On the other hand, this is much more lively performance. Perhaps the Duke of Roger Allam is a little less noble than one expects in this role; but Simon Russell's  Angelo is sufficiently villainous and Stella Gonet's Isabella is a strong  one. The rest of the cast keeps things moving at a good clip.  The tale  of the Governor Who Lets Things Go Too Far is a very timely one in any age.  Picture the present Mayor of New York's problems with law enforcement in a  city that put political correctness before the safety of its citizens. And  need we point out the obvious link with a High Official who uses his office  to gain sexual favors from young women? And they say Shakespeare has  nothing to say to a modern audience!!!  This play should be studied in  Political Science classes as well as in English ones.	1999-06-24

A recording needs no such casting, and yet the Arkangel set gets roles for two extra men. Fine with me.  This recording  starts with the long tale of the Father recited to piano music, thereby  causing instant confusion as to the time frame of this production. (The  &quot;All's Well That Ends Well&quot; has a locomotive pulling into a  station!) Also a good deal of the humor is removed from the speech, which  is indeed a spoof on the genre. But when we hear a good old fashioned  Laurel and Hardy metallic clunk to let us know that one of the Dromios has  just gotten a konk on the noggin, we know where we stand.  Between the  older Harper set [see the review on this page by a Reader from Florida] and  this there is little to choose castwise, except the sound on the Penguin  tapes is naturally much better. Since both are available, you might almost  toss between them. But on its own terms, this is a fine production of a  very silly play, the likes of which Shakespeare wisely chose never to  repeat.	1999-06-24

Granted that if you listen to Gilbert &amp; Sullivan, you will want to follow the words--which are not always  provided with many recordings nowadays. Then given the words, you will also  want to know the meanings of most of Gilbert's more esoteric words  (&quot;Daphnephoric&quot;), or simple words that have lost or changed their  meanings since Gilbert's day (&quot;Be firm, my pecker&quot;!), or  references to people (Captain Shaw), places (Basingstoke), or even objects  (Parliamentary trains).  Then too, the complete G&amp;S nut will want to  see the original versions of some of the songs and certainly the texts to  songs that were cut just after opening night or even during rehearsals. In  fact, I still have a lot of fun just looking at the left-hand pages to  brush up on my G&amp;S trivia. So while this book sells at twice the price  of other collections of the &quot;Savoy&quot; plays, it gives twice as much  and should be as welcome as the flowers that bloom in the Spring.	1999-06-15
