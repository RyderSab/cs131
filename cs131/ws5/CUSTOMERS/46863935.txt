It was a perfect backdrop for a book about incest,poronography,necrophilia,snuff films, murder and hollywood!!! Why was it perfect, well because if I was anywhere else other than the beach I probably would've been depressed to no end.  The Shock value of the book ends about halfway after the reader realizes that no character in this book is immune to the seedy undergound life of Hollywood and that really you should expect anything to happen. There's no bright light at the end or anywhere in this story. The main character is driven by desire to be famous, not the death of his girlfriend. He's also one of the sickest people you would ever read about.  <br /> <br />After awhile you start questioning the dark actions of every character and start to feel like the author is forcing the material to be dark instead of letting the characters and plot grow on their own.  <br /> <br />This book is worth 3 but not 5 stars.	2005-09-15
US	46863935	RHF0H3DBJYV34	0843952016	34858117	The Rising	Books	3	1	2	N	N	Typical until the end.	Most of this story ventures on the typical Zombie trail. For example, the world is now plague by flesh eating zombies, the survivors only way out is to shot them in the head and no one really know why the dead are coming back to life. Well they did try to explain a theory but purposefully left it open ended in order for a sequal. To me, this novel didn't get good until about page 200 where the survivors find out that the true horror is not done by the zombies but by the remaining living. This is where this book sets itself apart , just like the movie 28 day later did within the zombie genre. I just wish this portion of the book was longer.  <br />The ending is absolutely horrible and one of the most anticlimatic ones I've read in along time. <br />	2005-07-13

I've since heard on NPR that the story is based on a true story which gives it an even more haunting appeal. My only gripe with this book has been mentioned before by other reviewers. Morrison is such an excellent writer that at times it actually gets in the way of the simple horror of this story. Her description of things become TOO eloquent at times and lead me out of the trance of  doom and sorry that she originally wants the reader to feel. Sometimes a simple sentence is more effective and powerful than a paragraph which is the case with this book.<br /><br />For example,<br /><br />Sethe's straight forward dialog in the book always left me breathless while the flowery descriptions in between the dialogs seemed to be out of place, especially for a supernatural period novel about slavery.<br /><br />With that said, the story alone holds the book together and keeps you glued to the pages, especially towards the end.	2005-06-02
US	46863935	R2NHGKCZ53TD2F	156931778X	419611869	Battle Royale	Books	3	1	7	N	Y	Entertaining but predictable	This book had an amazing beginning and end and was overall entertaining, But all the claims by previous owners that it's a perfect book have to be biased. Also it's no where near as graphic as the hype proclaims it to be. None the less it was extremely entertaining and surprisingly easy to follow even though it had some 40 odd number characters.  <br /> <br />The big down fall is once you learn about the main characters you never really feel the threat of them dieing. The way the book is written the reader can tell that about 30 of the children are just filler characters and that they will all die before the main character does. I hate to say it but Stephen King's The Long Walk does a better job of maintaining the suspense of possible death than this book does. I always felt that everything will be ok at the end.  <br /> <br />The higlights of this book include the beginning which wastes no time in pulling the reader into the horror, the tense and violent altercation between 6 girls within a house and of course the semi-surprise ending.  <br /> <br />	2005-03-28

They both deal with the same topic and they both hold no punches when it comes to delivering disturbing images to its readers.  This book slows down a bit in the middle to explain the psychology of the children that are committing such a horrible crime , but it picks right back up with one of the most intense endings ever.<br /><br />At first I was in the mind set that what happened in this book isn't realistic, But the author cleverly gives you insight to the minds of the children , or in this case the minds of deviant children. In all cases, the reader realizes that they are experiencing what might be how certain criminals get their start. Every child or teenager in this book represented the undeveloped personalities of a deviant's criminal behavior. At the end of the book, the author asks the reader what happens in these childrens futures and to me it's evident. John becomes a serial rapist, paul without a doubt becomes a deranged serial killer, both cindy and bobby would suffer from emotional trauma that will most likely lead to some other kind of addiction and the ring leader dianne will end up being the worse deviant of them all; The person that goes through everyday life posing to be a level-headed model citizen but will do absolutely ANYTHING to WIN or stay ahead.<br /><br />And Barbrah, (the captured baby-sitter) represents every wholesome person out there that believes things like this doesn't happen. Unfortunately they do, and sometimes one learns this in horrific ways.<br /><br />Excellent book!!!	2005-01-27

I am an extremely patient person and usually finish every book I start regardless if it's an entertaining book or not. I could \\"NOT\\" finish this. After reading 717 pages of this 960 page book, I finally gave up. I really hate when stardome affords authors the ability to publish anything they want and write as much as they want. This book is exactly 500 pages TOO LONG and I love long books. The problem is that Rice leads the reader on for way too long. The first 250 pages are very interesting and very entertaining but once she dwelves into the history of the witches it becomes extremely repetitive. Every single generation of witches have the same experience with this so call ghost \\"Lasher\\", He picks one to torment and struggles with the rest of the family to continue his existance. This small synopsis is usually described in 2 to 3 pages of each generation even though the whole history portion of the book is about 500 pages.  The rest of the pages include a sprawling account of the family's wealth, sometimes sexually deviances, and boring fueds within the relatives.  With all of this said, I survived the history portion of this book and thought that I was finally going to get to the climax of the book.   Well a hundred pages later, Rice then decideds to describe every detail of the Mayfair HOUSE renovation.     That's right people,, After 700 pages of reading family history, she actually felt comfortable adding a completely boring section about the main character  and her boyfriend renovating the old Mayfair House.   I'm an architect and I still found this to be extremely arrogant and pretentious of the author to include such a boring section at the portion of a novel that usually includes the climax. I then stopped reading because I could care less what happens at the end ,,,,besides nothing in the last 200 pages could save the previous 700 page disaster.	2004-12-28
US	46863935	R1OC7RXSP6XHBC	0679735771	92932803	American Psycho	Books	3	0	0	N	N	A Great Satire	I'm really not interested in what others have interpreted about this book. Mainly because I feel the author wrote this novel with the intent of giving the reader the opportunity to develop the premise. In context this is one of the best ambiguous books I've ever read.  It's doesn't attempt to give the reader answers or to give the reader a tightly controlled novel. It reads as if one has picked up someones diary on the subway and decide to read it. <br /> <br />The author of this diary is Patrick Bateman. A succussful but tormented man living in a completely self-centered 80's society. Internally he's crying out for help or at least an escape, but he doesn't know how to ask for help. This I believe is slowly driving him crazy and causes him to internally take out his frustration by imagining he's a serial killer.  I personally didn't believe any of the murders actually happened, there were just to many loop wholes in his stories, but I never questioned bateman's sanity.This man WAS going CRAZY!!! As a matter of fact , If the \\"Diary\\" had continued for another 200 or three hundred pages, the reader would've experience a real attempt by bateman at murder or even suicide.  <br /> <br />Of course,this is just my interpretation. You'll probably have a different one.  <br /> <br />What's funny about this book is that it's ambiguity is also it's downfall. Because it's so satirical, the gruesomes murders don't have the same impact. There were times that I felt disturbed, but mostly I felt the same  after reading these horrific details of his fantasy murders as when I read his critics of Whitney Houston's Albums. I was entertained but not moved or shocked.  <br /> <br />In all, I felt this was an excellent satire on all terms. A satire of the Reagan Era as well as a satire of a Serial killer.	2004-11-16

Sure there are some excellent stories in this novel. All of which won the Bram Stoker award, Gone, The Box, and Closing Time. The last story firedance was also a refreshing change for ketchum fans, but 70% of the book was clearly filler material. I really didn't enjoy the 10 page short story format. Even though you can get 30 stories in a book, they all seemed incomplete in some way. I always finished a story wishing there were about 10 more pages. <br /> <br />Also alot of the stories lacked the edge that jack ketchum's novels usually have. It was almost like they packaged this set together to rival a Stephen King collection, even though ketchum's style is completely different. <br /> <br />I would reccommend this novel as a starter for new ketchum readers but not to his faithful \\"Hardcore\\" followers. <br />	2004-10-05

This time around The Otherland Series made plot turns that to me actually slowed the story down. In an attempt to make the story more complex, Williams splits the group of travelers up into different simulations. Some of the simulations were useless and very difficult to get through. For example , the whole vegetable and kitchen utensile battle seemed contrived and told the reader absolutely nothing about the story. Renie and Xabbu were also split up from the group but yet they really didn't learn anything more than What Orlando and Fredricks did. On the other hand Paul Jonas's Character became more and more interesting while he regained his memory. Also the villians were developed in a much more intricate way as we learn more about what the whole mystery is about.  <br /> <br />Overall the story is still one of the most original and interesting sci-fi novels I've read but would've had a quicker pace if it left out the different simualtions.  <br />	2004-08-24

The steps are clear-cut and presice and I plan on using the techniques to become free of debt. But to me the most powerful thing about the book is how it changes your way of thinking about debt. I like everyone hates being in debt but for some reason we've come to think that it's neccesary. The whole nation is in debt and it's only getting worse. This book opens your eyes to the fact that debt destroys lives and causes a never ending cloud of depression over you. <BR>I really don't think people realize this in their everyday lives. They buy and buy what they can't afford and wonder why they're not happy with their spouses, jobs, careers, lives. Bottom line ,,, Debt equals NO PEACE and this book proves it.<br />The only negative about this older version of the book is that it doesn't suggest what a person should do if they don't have the money to take the steps. The book is so powerful in influencing your mindset it seems strange that it leaves out the important fact that a person may have to get a part-time job or they may have to cut out a lot of luxuries in order to get debt free. This version also doesn't suggest how a couple should work out differences of opinions when it comes to credit. <br />Other than those two things this is a great read for everyone and a book I feel every freshman in college should get for free before they start receiving all of those pre-approved credit card statements..	2004-06-03

I've seen people say he copied other stories like Return of the Living Dead,,etc. etc. But they fail to realize that this story was written in 1958. There was nothing like it at the time. It's not so much of a vampire story as it is a story of humanity and loneliness.  The main character is the only survivor of a plague that turns people into vampires. He's the only human left  and he has to find ways of surviving while not going to far from his Shelter-Like home.  The story also proposes some interesting viewpoints on how the vampires were started.<br /><br />It's not really scary at all but haunting in that you feel a sense of doom for the main character. Really, How long can someone survive in an enviroment like that completely alone.<br />I gave it three stars because the story was actually written in the future from the original copywright,, 1976. Matheson didn't really attempt to forecast any changes in the world between 1958 and 1976. He pretty much assumed everything would be the same including cars being started with a ignition button and black people still being called Negroes.:)  Other than that it is a great and quick (178 pgs.) Novel.	2004-05-19

The reader actually feels claustrophobic when he describes the evil thats possessed Regan and struck fear in her mother and family within the townhouse in Washington D.C.  The last 80 pages were truely gripping as you read the demons attempt to trick everyone in the room into stopping the exoricism. This wasn't in the movie. The extended conversations between Karras and the demon were supurb and I thought they should've been in the movie also. Also the book highlights the final confrontation between Merrin and The demon much better than the movie. You actually hear the demon make statements about their last confrontation.But overall it's the closest Book to movie transitions I have ever experienced. They are almost  identical  An excellent book and will definitely be in my top five.	2004-05-07

I then started comparing it to other mystery books and realized that this book is far from great.     my first problem is how far-fetched the whole story is. Every mystery has a struggling dectective in it, but this guy's life is just unbeleivable. His whole divorce and separation from his daughter is completely over the top. He never abused them nor really treated them poorly, But yet they \\"Refuse\\" to ever talk to him again because he was a workaholic? The overall plot also took unbelievable twist and turns just for the sake of it.  With all of this going on , the book was still predictable. 1/2 way into it, you can predict who will be killed by the serial killer and who will survive.     Red Dragon is MUCH better.	2004-04-16

The problem is that I don't think the characters &quot;KNOW&quot; themselves at all. The reader knows that the characters are unhappy now but I often wondered if they were ever happy. Especially since the main character's mother is so disfunctional as well. Homes does a great job of showing how screwed up this family is, but I don't think she let's the reader know how they got that way. This fact was the only bad thing about this book. Homes' style is to drop you in the middle of the story and to leave the reader there as if your spying on the characters. No revelations or answers are proposed. There's no build up, climax or resolution. <br />On the other hand, the predicaments these couples get themselves into are absolutely hilarious as well as being insane and just like in American Beauty you don't know whether to laugh or feel sorry for them.  <br />Even in the tragic ending you don't get a sense that the parents have actually learned anything.<br />Overall, I thought this was a good book, i just wish I learned more about the main characters past.	2004-03-30

By the end of the book, you understood WHY he was psychotic. Most crime novels ignore this treament and chooses to piant the killer as a one dimensional character. Hannibal is barely in this novel and quite honestlY could've been left out. To me his character in the book was used as filler chapters and was at times boring. I found the character development of the FBI profiler and The RED Dragon way more interesting. I really feel I could read anything with WILL Grahms character in it and wish Mr. Harris had included him in the Silence of the Lambs as well.     I do feel that people who watch the movies (Manhunter or Red Dragon) first may be dissappointed by the novel only because the movies' interpetations were done so well	2004-03-15

If you read Off Season , there's really no need to read Off Spring because it's basically the same story, without the creative suspense of the first.  Both books have the same synopsis,,,, A few people go to this small rural town for a vacation only to find that they are being attacked by cave dwelling cannibals. I can't really tell too much of the story because i would give away the plot to BOTH books. Off Season is worth reading. Off Spring lacks the creative slow suspense and terror that Jack Ketchums creates by describing horrific incidents as other characters witnesses them.   In short Off Spring pales in comparison to Off season.	2004-02-12

In short the story is about a young boy's travels across america and a parallel land called the territories. He's forced to make this journey in order to find a cure for his mother's cancer.   During his travels he incounters  both fantastical and realistic evil. He also encounter allies within both worlds. The best part of this novel is the development of the young naive Jack (young lead character) to the strong and confident jack at the end. As the reader, I felt afraid for him in the beginning during this journey and wondered how could a young 12 year old boy survive? By the end, I felt completely confident of jack's abilities and didn't doubt that he  would succeed.     Although there have since been better sci-fi novels (Tad William's,, Otherland series). The Talisman is still one of the best novels to merge the coming of age story with science fiction.	2004-01-02

As most Ketchum fans know, The publisher Ballantine originally ruined this book and may have ruined an otherwise very successful carreer. \\"Off Season\\", ketchum's first novel is truely horrific, but since even the unexpurgated version isn't the original version , I wonder if somewhere amongst the multiple edits it lost its power to be disturbing? Unlike \\"Girl Next Door\\", I wasn't disturbed by this book. It did have it's moments of horror like no other horror novel , but it still seemed to be holding back something. I still wonder if the original that was thrown away by Ketchum was the true \\"Disturbing\\" version.     Now for the good side.   Even though Ketchum doesn't spend many words developing characters, they are always realistic. The reader doesn't always like the characters, just like in real life, where you don't always like most people you meet. But the things that happen to them in this book makes you swallow your dislike and immediatedly feel dread and sorrow for them. The villians on the other hand,, are savages,\\"literally\\" But with that said, only about 3 of them are adult men. Some of the rest are made up of and 11 year pregnant girl and even younger children, once again blurring the lines between good and evil. Out of all the gore and horror through-out the book, the end of this version really solidifies it as a dark and depressing novel of which Ketchum is known.     I would reccommend this book to other horror fans ,but unlike Ketchum's \\"Girl Next Door\\", I don't think it's a must read for everyone.	2003-10-28
US	46863935	R1ERK0ZWQUBG0W	0743424425	966329377	The Shining	Books	4	0	2	N	N	The Original Shining!!!	There is no wonder why stephen king is the master of the suspense and horror novel today. His first three books, Carrie, Salem's Lot and The Shining marked a breakthrough for horror novels on many levels.   Although The Shining was slower than what I anticipated , I found the book to be amazingly realistic.  In the 70's Stephen King wrote a horror novel around the ordinary or not so ordinary lives of a family,  King develops the characters by letting them reveal themselves through thought. Inbetween the dialogs you find what the characters are really thinking in parenthesis. You find out that the father is truely struggling with his self worth and alcholism, The mother is struggling with her love for her family and the distruss of the husband as well as her constant worrying about things in general. And finally ,but most importantly you find out about the sons conflict with his kinetic powers, while also trying to understand life through an child's mind.     All of this is what makes stephen king a master. Not the horror itself. By the end of the book, the reader truely cares about that family. In a lot of ways you feel sorry for the father who is, after all the things he's been through, haunted and possessed by the house. It makes the end more sad than horrific.     For those who saw the movie, don't expect the same story. as always it's different, but Kubrick's version is even more of an interpretation than most novel to movie transitions. Overall, in the movie you get the sense that this family is a little weird even before they get to the house. The father , in jack nicholson's portrayal, is frazzeled and wide eyed in the very beginning of the movie. The mother is this overly passive human being that in no way could've realistically survived the ending. And the boys portrayal is just flat out weird.  In the book the family is basically a normal family with realistic troubles that eventually turn into horrific ones.    The only negative point I have with the book, is that it appears that in King's earlier novels he struggles with the supernatural aspect of the story.  Why didn't the ghost possess the boy instead? Especially if that's who they were after in the first place. Also the fact that both the mother and the cook gets beaten by a mallet and still stands and walks around defies the realistic aspect of the terror.     Overall it's a good novel about the struggles of an everyday family with a haunting twist.	2003-10-07

There's books like this one that's way better than a 3 star rating but not quite as good as my four star books.    This book deserves a 3-1/2 star for the action alone. mccammon really knows how to keep a book moving with non-stop action and suspense. I read They Thirst by him and that book was the same way. The other positive point is that this is a book about a realistic horror of when a mother's baby is kidnapped. That has to be the worse thing other than death for anyone to experience. mccammon captures this excellently in the way he describes the mothers desparation to find her baby and the sheer terror of not knowing what has happened.   With that said, the best part of the book, is the villian. Mccammon develops a true realistic monster in Mary Terror and successfully explains how this woman has  gotten to be so crazy by explaining her past and writing almost half the book from her perspective.   This book tied Stephen King's Misery for the Bram Stoker's award and after reading it you will know why.	2003-09-01

It's only 256 pages but I got to page 200 feeling like I have another 2 or 3 hundred more pages left to read to complete the story. The storyline really doesn't have a climax it just develops to a \\"nothing\\" end. If this was the first 1/4 of a novel I would think that it's a excellent beginning to a sci-fi thriller. But it's not.  The story begins with the main character and two of her friends experiencing something horrific in a tunnel. You never really find out what that is but none the less it leads up to a mystery of old archeoligical findings and some kind of supernatural connection to all of the main characters?  200 pages later you find out that there's some \\"MONSTERS\\" around???? With only 56 pages left you read about how they Kill the \\"MONSTERS\\". That's it!!!!<br />I have to admit I did like the characters in the book and I thought the author did a good job of developing realistic characters with humanistic qualities, but they never really are aloud to do anything in this story. They aren't really involved at all with the story line because the story line is too incomplete for the characters to be effectively changed .<br />The good part of this book is that it's only 256 pages.	2003-08-12

Don't expect an action-packed novel full of twist and turns and cliff-hangers. This epic is a strraight forward sci-fi mystery that gets it's complexity from the content of the virtual reality world that is a part of the plot. <br />The plot is simple. A brother of one of the main characters falls into a coma after being in this virtual reality world. The main character then teams up with other people to find out what happened. Their journey takes them into the vr world that claimed her brother. This is where the complexity lies. The vr world in so intruiging that you keep reading just to find out more about it. There's also other side plots that will tie in to the main plot later in the other books. <br />The reason i gave it 3 and not more is because i'm more of a horror book fan and use to more action. But i was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this huge novel even though it has very little horror content. I will read the second,,well actually you have to read the whole series because this book purposefully  ends with no resolution. So if you want to find out the true mysteries behind Otherland, then you have 3000 some odd pages left to read.<br />Enjoy.	2003-07-23

And that's forensics. The forensic details in this book keeps you interested, other than that it's just another mystery novel. Cornwell keeps the reader hooked by introducing a simplistic plot but incorporates the details in the forensics investigation and police investigation. No unneccesary supernatural events or meaningless relationships, everything in this book is precise and to the point. A definite page turner.	2003-05-05

But if you're into sci-fi/supernatural horror, then forget about reading it. Girl next Door is about the everyday horror we humans experience called Child Abuse. This book holds no punches. I read about 200 pages and actually had to contiplate whether I wanted to finish it, not because it was bad but because it was so vivid and disturbing. It starts off like a junior high school read. I'm not sure if this is how Ketchum writes (this is my first book by him) or if he decided to write in a simplistic style because it was narrated by a twelve year old boy. Either way it's affective. It pulls you in quickly with it's simplistic style and then holds the reader captive with it's horrific details.     I know this story is based on true incidents but even if it wasn't, I completely believe that horror like this is happening even today, probably even while I'm typing this review. True evil comes in the form of Human insanity, ignorance, and learned hatred. This book slaps you in the face with that reality. Anyone that can ignore the significance of this book is probably the same people that ignore or down play our world's contributions to racism, classicism, and sexism.  The characters of this book in a way represent a microcosm of what this world was,is and probably will be in the future. While we hide behind our safety nets of enjoying Science fiction and supernatural horror of the likes of Sixth Sense, The Others, and Signs, real life horrors of child abuse are happening everyday. Well, this book forces you to deal with it. It is as close to experiencing child abuse without actually being abused or witnessing abuse.     I am not saying , you will like this book, But I am saying that this book should be apart of our pop cultured, american heritage as much as Tom Sawyer,Roots or War and Peace. Child abuse is REAL,, terrifing and truely evil and this book proves it.	2003-04-06

But before I get into that, let me say that \\"The Show\\" is so far the best clive barker Book I've read (out of Imajica,Damnation game,Inhuman Condition). It is NOT the best book ever as some people on the site claim but it is good. I admit ,the simple parts of the story keeps you interested and makes you beg for more . (Good Vs.evil) (dreams vs. fears), but clive complicates things to the ninth degree with useless Sci-fi, fantasy imagery. This story like Imajica , is full of complex but underdeveloped themes.  That's when I figured out why I'm not a fan. <br />I truly feel that great forms of art are born from simple, basic and minimal ideas that have room to grow and develop. I personally get more involved with characters and plots that develop through-out the book. The books I've read so far by Barker have themes that seemed to be complete and complex before you start reading. They don't develop, they just simply exist and you are force to accept them. Both Imajica and The Show are identical is this way. I would love for barker to take a simple premise like \\"envy\\" and develop it into a complete and concise novel. But from past experience I now know that barker would rather take \\"Envy\\" and match it up with the 4 dimensions, the end of the world and a land called Rezirdan that you can reach through sex. Lol. <br />With that said. I will still probably read everville but maybe not until next year sometime. I just need some simple depth out of my novels for a change.	2003-04-01

But un-like most history books this one is full of biased ideals that is typical of an OLD SKOOL raver. Imagine if you will reading a book about the civil war that always states How it wishes the south had won the war? Well this is exactly how this book is. He describes the plethora of genres within electronic music and then tries to prove the viability of one over the other. <br />Even though I agreed with some (very few, but some) of his ideals, I still felt it was useless to include it in the book. Why state that IDM is bad and hardcore and BIG Beat are good over and over again in a book? Is this a book or a thesis paper???<br />Here's a quote from the book that ironically not only describes a genre that Simon didn't like but also clearly describes why I Didn't like this book. <br />\\"As a result,no matter how superficially startling the form-and-norm bending mischief sounds,drill and bass feel pale and purposeless compared with music created by the jungle fundamentalists.\\" <br />Mr. Reynolds needs to read his own quote and apply it to his writings, because no matter how startling his use of words are, his description of our music scene pales in comparison to even a candy raver.	2003-03-03

But it also Showed some signs of Mr. King just starting his craft. Unlike His First masterpiece Carrie, He wrote a book long enough to start his now classic character building. I don't think he did a good job of that in this book, compared to his later works. I still enjoyed the book, but wasn't really scared. It's more entertaining than anything. To me, the realistic horror of Carrie's life and the complete fantasy world of The Talisman were more scary.	2003-02-16

This novel was written like a compilation of some of his other novels. Although the realistic issues of abuse were interesting. The story didn't seem to have focus. it did seem to have elements of other stories King has written. <br />1. Confinment to a bed? (Misery)<BR>2. rapid Dog attack ? (Cujo)<br />And What about the links to Deloris Claiborne? Was the movie based on this book? or Was this book a complete copy of that book? I'm confused?<br />Plus I didn't understand at all His need to throw a little supernatural component in the story's end.	2003-02-16

So I decided to borrow the next three in the saga. I was bored to death By The Vampire Lestat and if it wasn't for the Twin's story my fate would've been the same for \\"Queen\\". Basically after three books, I'm just tired of  rice's Whiney, moralistic Vampire. There's not one True Evil Vampire in All three stories and Lestat jumps from being evil to saintly from page to page. His character  development is unclear through out these stories and become even more confusing in Queen. Therefore I'm taking a break from Anne Rice and will start looking for a better vampire series.	2003-01-09

The stories either just end with no resolution or never never come to a peak at all. I felt like I was starting a book in the middle and stopped reading it in the middle also. &quot;The End of Alice&quot;, was much better.	2002-12-27

The levels of abuse from Carrie's mother draws chills down your spine and makes you wonder how many people are in the world that are REALLY like that. I've seen the movie several times but never read the book. That was a big mistake. Carrie's revenge is much more devastating than the movie let's you believe.It reminds me of all the modern day school shootings we are experiencing today. This is a Stephen King's Classic and a must read.	2002-09-29
US	46863935	R2QJ7QUZLGJK58	0671664816	351629865	They Thirst	Books	4	1	2	N	N	Good Book,But not great!	They Thirst is a good Book, but not as great as people make it out to be. It has some truely scarey passages including, a little girl's plea for her victim to come outside to play; the pre-vampires cocoon state; the watch dogs over those pre-vampires and just the idea of vampires taking over a city. But I was always expecting more. I felt the book should've spent more time developing the plot of the people surviving the horrific nights during the vampire domination instead of focusing on a boring and typical murder case ,which takes up most of the beginning of the book. although I must say the ending is one of the best endings I've read in a long time.     Interview with a vampire is still my Favorite Vampire book mainely becasue of Rice's style of writing and her confidence to do something different. They thirst at times falls into to the typical vampire horror genre that it makes fun of through out the book.   With all of that said, I still recommend it, but don't expect \\"the best vampire book ever\\". it's just a good horror novel.	2002-09-15

With exception to the 150 pages of Gabrielle's creation and the 100 pages or so Of marius's story , the book dragged on and on about the past. Take out 300 pages and this would be a good book. This is the second book I've read of the Vampire Chronicles and to me it's No where near the first and I hope the rest are better.	2002-08-10
US	46863935	RUYESST9X3X1G	042518109X	567976695	Whispers	Books	1	11	18	N	N	One of the worst	This book took me two years to complete. And I only completed it because I always finish a book I start. The characters are very one dimesnsional and typical of Koontz's books. How many times will he use the successful but trouble past,lead woman character and the Tough but sympathetic and lonely detective???? How many??? The book is also very predictable. I knew the big secret a 1/4 of the way through and I never doubted that &quot;Everything will be o.k. at the end&quot;. The only highlight of this book is the villian's past which of course you only get a taste of at the very end of the novel. Other than that,  you have no idea why he's doing what he's doing. Oh,, I forgot,, he's crazy and keeps returning. That's enough of an explanation.<BR>If you are a true Horror novel fan but new to koontz, please don't waste your time with this book. Also don't go by the ratings on this site. Apparantly his fans are blind to what's good and bad by him. Watchers and Phantoms are much better books but they give Whispers the same 4 or 5 star rating.  Go Figure?	2002-07-28
US	46863935	RTLYGYEHKVXOF	0451205421	835415534	The Door to December	Books	4	1	1	N	N	One of the Best By Koontz	I'm not a Koontz fan at all. His characters are predictable, his storylines are repetitive from book to book, and his writing seems to be one dimensional. But Door to December is an exception. You feel a deeper horror from the realistic levels of child abuse than the supernatural content, but he blends both aspects well. The only down fall to this book was the ending. Although believable , he once again resorts to cheesy solutions instead of realistic ones. I would recommend this book over All of his others.	2002-07-28

As a matter of fact I have a hard time recalling them to memory ,even though I finished the books only 7 months ago. At his best Clive Barker can scare the hell out of me, but it doesn't seem that he writes at his best 70% of the time during a book.	2002-07-28

After reading Damnation Game,, I'm starting to wonder if Barker can carry a Theme all the way through. He's wonderful at creating an amazing topic and subperb at giving horrific details of events, But this book, like Imajica left me wondering, WHY???? he seems to take another great story and makes it pointless by the time you finish the book. This is my third read from him and I have two other books I need to read. They better get better or Mr.Barker won't get anymore purchases from me.	2002-06-23

Luis and Claudia are by far the better of Anne Rices characters. I'm sorry but after Vampir Lestat, I'm bored of lestat's character.In this book he's secondary to Luis and Claudia and that's a perfect situation. If you're looking for an alternative vampire novel and haven't yet discovered Anne Rice, then read this novel first .	2002-06-23

Even though it had some interesting visuals and some very complex characters, I thought the story was useless. I never really felt the \\"the big threat\\" of a \\"unreconciled dominions\\". And with-out a doubt the reconciliation was the weekest of endings. it was my first read by him and i understand that authors can't please everyone all of the time. I bought Damnation game ,Great and Secret Show and Everville. i truely hope these three books are much better...	2002-04-28
