The people mentioned in this book like to point out the double standards, lies, mismanagement, cronism, adultry, nation building, budget busting, and the double speak of Republicans because they are Un-American.  The try to ruin the reputation of our great President because he was failed businessman, a draft dodger of sorts, an oilman who could not find oil, a leader that has taken more vacation time then any other (and he still has 3 years to go), who hates to read, takes naps, and goes to bed as early as many grade school children.   Obviously these people are envious of the man that represents all that is great about American Conservatism.  Finally these people are angry at the party that is giving tax breaks to the top 1% because they are jealous that they are not millionaires and therefore losers.	2005-09-27

She even ran Pres. Bush's reelection campaign in New Jersey after quiting her Cabinet position because of how little she agreed with her boss.  She has her priorities screwed up and her party and her country are the losers for it.   <br /> <br />To speak out now is just a way to try to get over the guilt of helping put a moderate face on extremist policies.

This book is only one of three of his I have quit reading, out of his last 4, because it was so unbelieveable, preachy, and silly. <br /> <br />First he suggests that enviromental organizations create huge enviromental havoc to gain funds and support.  I am talking about havoc on the scale that the former USSR would have been pressed to create with all thier resourses and that the Taliban would envy.  Come on!  How do enviromentalists have the funds, training, resources, influence, and money to train terrorists and super spies while not having most of these tree huggers putting up a fight.  Only the people at FOX News would buy something like this. <br /> <br />He also condemns enviromental groups for trying to manage and market thier message as if every non-profit, politician, religion, and company doesn't.   <br /> <br />Using the same logic you can infer that other non-profits like the Cancer Society, as an example, don't really want to find a cure because then thier organization would desolve. Arguements like this and others diminish the credibility of his message. <br /> <br />Finally he preaches a lot against the idea of global warming.  Fine.  Great.  Yet he over does it as if he thinks we are all a bunch of idiots. <br /> <br />I love Michael Crichton work but I think he should start considering retiring if this is the best he can come up with these days. <br /> <br />	2005-01-31

Mr. Donaldson has a horrible habit, however, that I had hoped by now he would overcome.  In order to fill three or 4 books in a series he likes to repeat things over and over and over again as if you just didn't read them a few pages ago.  He does this with all of his books, not just these series, and it is very agrivating.  This style does not change regardless of the series, the character he is speaking through, how many stories he writes, or the story.  Its as if he is a hack that gets paid by the page instead of for writing a tight well written story.  I am so disgusted by this I don't know if I want to go through 3 more books like this.  However there is more money in a series so I can see how money would play a more important part than art. <br /> <br />Also the author likes to use guilt with a heavy hand.  Also his characters in all his books, not just this series, are heavy into being martyrs, full of self pity for not being perfect, and very absorbed in punishing themselves for thier imperfections as his repitition will remind you over and over and over again. Does this pattern sound familiar? <br /> <br />I got the book to relive old times from when I last read this series 20 years ago but would not have picked it up otherwise nor would I recommend it.  When it first came out he was very original for this genre even if his repitition, does he think we are all idiots, could drive you crazy.  He story can still be fun but his bad writing habits often make it seem more like work than entertainment. <br /> <br />Finally it is easy to see that he has not grown much as an artist.  For example he is still battling Lord Foul.  Why not just kill this guy once an for all.  Don't the idiots of the fantasy world see if they don't he will just keep coming back to screw The Land again?  Obviously an idiot can see this but a author with only one good story in his head just likes to rehash the same formula over and over again so that he won't have to work to hard.	2005-01-21

Very tedious at times because it is written like a lecture or a scientific paper.  It is written like a typical book of the early 19th Century with all the English snobbery, arrogance, and pompostity you's expect.  All this makes it authentic and questioning if this book about magic and magicians coulld be real but it also very a drag for those that are not big fans of this type of druggery. Finally the book is so filled with fictional footnotes that it slows the pace of the book even further to the point that most fans of fantasy will be turned off by this book or give up on it. <br /> <br />Having said that, the story is awesome and it breaks new ground in not only the fantasy genre but also that of historical fiction.  If you can push yourself through it, or better yet listen to it on audio like I did, you will be glad you did.	2005-01-14

The story is generally fun but it is needlessly long, the subject dated (although still needing review and consideration), and stuffed too much with the writer's ego who is anxious to prove to us how smart he is. <br /> <br />Finally I find one major flaw.  His main character is a naive North Carolina \\"genius\\" with a fundamentalist upbringing who is exposed to the sex and drinking of college and almost ruined because of it.  During all this, to maintain the appearance of Charlotte's innocence, we are led to believe that up till this point she has had no sexual curiosity, no self sexual exploration (not even masturbation), and never gets horny.  In other words she is an unrealistic SuperWoman.  Her fundamentalist upbringing is also only hinted at without mentioning the hang-ups, insecurities, paranoia, and bible reading that comes with it.   <br /> <br />Mr. Wolfe isn't \\"smart\\" enough to realize you can have sexual feelings, acknowledge them (even enjoy them), and even play with yourself without being promiscuous or a drunk.  In other words he tried to write about the \\"fictional\\" character of choice from the 1950's and tried to merge her with Animal House.  This heavy handedness takes away the impact this book could and should have. <br />	2004-12-16

For those that trully like fantasy or sci-fi (or a mix of both that this seems to try to be) the story continuesly disappoints because its fictional premises follow almost no logical path, what path it follows constantly conterdicts itself, and it leaves more holes than it fits.  For example most main characters become expert marksmen with little practice yet Roland had to receive training.  Also guns seem to always reload themselves even though no one is carrying amunition, and the world is held together in a rose... come on.  Also this whole series, including this book, are just to long and therefore often boring.  If you can get past all this and just enjoy the ride then the whole series, for the most part, has been a fun ride.	2004-11-03

Over time he has changed his \\"style\\" to become more preachy, to demonize anyone form of belief other than what he believes, and his stories have become weaker, less original, and tedious. <br /> <br />He has gone from being one of my favorite writers when I wanted something to read just for fun to a mere shadow of himself.  I have an ackward relationship with him.  One one hand he is like an old best friend who I relied on for many years.  On the other hand he is now like that same friend but who is going down the tubes yet who I keep hoping will come out of his free fall.  I sometimes still read him because I keep wishing to find the same spark he used to inspire yet at the same time I try to avoid much of his stuff because I had to see how far he has fallen.  Like Stephen King, maybe its time Dean considers retiring.	2004-08-19

For those that like dedective series that are more thriller than detective, and for those that like stories about the underbelly of our society versus the romantised novels about it... then this is a book for you.  If I could find a fault with it, in terms of fun, it is that it is to short.  The hardback has big letters and a lot of spacing to make a dime novel appear to be a classic.

I think he most not like cats or thinks we cat people most be perverted) while demonizing the ideas of others that don't come close to his.  Of course all his characters agree with him, except the evil ones who he alludes are controlled by what I assume is the Devil.  He does this while also making fun of New Age believers, people into health foods, and so on.  Weird and hypocritical.<br />The story becomes a vehicle to spew this nonsense while letting the story take a back seat.

Everything he has written in these gendres in the last 4 or 5 years have be below par, slow, boring, and not worth bothering with.  I keep trying however because how much I used to love him.<br />This story, a continuation of Summer of Night, like another he did with one of the characters, from the same book, is bland, not very exciting, and confusing mixxed with unenjoyable.  The reason for the latter is that the author is obviously a aethist.  I have no problem with that but when you are writing a supernatural horror story and trying to preach a his aethist beliefs (ones I largely share) then it takes away from the story, its plausiblity, and its ghosts (one, Duane, who doesn't even believe in his existence along with the main character who is almost killed by one).  Lets face it, when writing a fantasy the author needs to pretend the fantasy is real even when he knows it isn't. <br />Besides this the story still stinks and it makes me sad the Dan may have lost what was once a powerful voice in fiction.  I give it two stars, instead of one, more out of respect for what he once was than for the quality of the story.	2002-05-04

With this book and his last few, I think he is losing it.  I give this book 2 stars only because I love Thorn and I still have hope for the author.<br />What's bad.  I used to read Hall because of his original and quarky bad guys.  I also read him for his use of language (he's also a poet) and imagination.  In this book the bad guys don't seem very unusual, the language is that of a dime novel, the coincidences are to many, and certain important events are left unexplained... such as an explosion that plays a key role towards the end of the book.<br />This novel seem like a novel that was rushed and nobody double checked.

Here he tries to tackle the future.. hence science fiction.  My advice is he lay off the latter.  The novel is very weak science fiction, the premise weak, and the story is put together in a way remenicent of light weight serial novella of old while trying to make a serious point which instead sounds silly.  The results are that the novel is not fun to read.  Save your money and buy his earlier work instead.	2001-01-05

Its been done before and better.  The book is lightweight fun yet you can't help feeling like you have read the same thing before... kind of like all romance novels seem to be the same.<br />It is easy to right about the &quot;good&quot; war where Germans are devils and Americans are angels (usually) even if while we know things are never really this black and white.  In this way the story is very predictable and one dimentional yet if this is the way you like your stories then this one is for you.	2001-01-05

His books didn't ever strike me as conservative or liberal but equally critical of both.  This books is a collection of articles that will explain why he is called a conservative.  Yet you will also see why he is an intellectual (something he would hate being called because he is critical of them).<br />However, whatever your philophy, you'll find find something to agree with and much to contemplate.  Also, Wolfe has the ability of taking an &quot;intellectual&quot; arguement (even if it is biased) and making it something easy (even fun) to read... and this is no mean feat.  The reader for this tame is also fantastic.<br />My only critisism with the book is that it is a little too egocentric and biased for me to take on regularly particularly when he uses selective logic to favor his views.	2000-12-20

He has written so many books in this category that I think he is running out of ideas.  He also has a formula, which although he has been trying to change in the last 6 or 7 years, is still basically the same in each book.  For example you know that the main characters will discover each to be the soulmate of the other.<br />In this book his style is wearing thin and reads more like a R. L. Stine book for teenagers.  His characters are also to cutesy, their lines are from a 60's sitcom, and I am tired of his using his super smart dog (usually a labrador) character which he feels he needs to put in more and more of his books.  I try to keep myself from buying any more of his work yet, because I used to be a big fan, sometimes I am desperate for quick read and he is the only thing I can find at the airport.	2000-10-19

It is one of those books we like to pretend is not the way things really are.  However, it also makes lying, manipulation, exploitation, etc... seem positive and necessary.  I don't agree with this.<br />I think the book should be required reading in schools not so people can copy it but so, like alchoholics needing to acknowledge they have a problem, that our society has a chance to move beyond it.	2000-09-26

This is something I would seldom recommend yet in this book I think it is a must.  The reason is that the story keeps getting side tracked with lengthy preaching and oratory  that does more to turn me off than to inform me.	2000-07-21

David Horowitz is a preacher of the neo-conservative faith with all  this implies<br />If you are the type of conservative who realizes that most  conservatives have some ideas others think are &quot;liberal&quot;, that is  mature enough to know that there are no simple answers, who has been wrong  on issues on more than one occassion, and who is more interested in finding  the truth then in reassuring yourself of your own superiority... then look  elsewhere.	2000-05-11

It reads more like a thriller than a mystery.  Yet it also explores the depth of its characters in the  tradition of a &quot;John D. McDonald&quot; (Travis McGee novels).  Still  it is more.  It is philosophical, introspective, and much of its language  is poetic.  A mystery with a lot meat.	2000-02-01

Great book.  Should be required reading in schools so that children know the diffrence from what organizations teach us about a holy book and what it really says.  The critics seem to find fault with it, not because his  info is wrong, but because it is not what they want to hear.  This seems  more of an agruement for wishful thinking than for this books validity or  facts.<br />The book is also easy to read (listen to) and fun.  If you believe  honesty is the best policy, when dealing with the Bible, then this book is  for you.	1999-09-30
