I didn't realize that I was jumping into the 15th or 16th book in the series.  I can't wait to go back and read the previous ones.  This book combines ancient history and adventure, as well as politics and the military, in an effort to provide a first-rate novel.  The character development that went into this book and the series is phenomenal and is second only to the creative storyline that keeps you guessing until the end.  If you like me are a fan of paperback novels packed with action and adventure this series is for you.	2005-10-10

I'll admit I'm a sucker for a paperback that I can throw in my bag and break out here and there for a few quick chapters.  I can tell you that this book definitely stay in my bag long.  The action was adequately paced and the character development was well established (something often lacking in mass market paperbacks).  For a paperback filled with political themes and published in 1978 this book still rings true and is very enjoyable today.	2005-09-20

Beaumont Novel)	Books	3	1	1	N	N	Decent but Different	I've read this book a couple times and it really isn't Jance's best.  Actually it doesn't even come close.  Beaumont, the main character is still present but that's where the similarities to a lot of the other books really end.  I do have to recognize the author's talent in capturing a cruise along the inside passage from Seattle to Alaska.  Jance did a great job of portraying the sites and sounds of the cruise as well as some of the little cities along the trip.  Overall though it was not enough to make up for the struggling storyline that this novel provides.  As a long time fan of Beau and Jance I know I will probably read this book again, just probably not in the near future.	2005-09-20

Brookfield lays this book out very logically starting with a section on getting ready.  He then progresses through: Advanced Lower Arm and Grip Training; Advanced Grip Challenges; and Steel Bending.  No matter where you turn to this book is filled with helpful tips and ideas to get your workouts going. <br /> <br />I can honestly say this book and the ironmind grippers have already improved my hand strength immensely.  I would highly recommend this book and look forward to acquiring Brookfield's other book \\"Mastery of Hand Strength.\\"   <br />	2005-09-07

This book is broken into the following four very useful sections.  Section One explains the History of the Russian Kettlebell.  Section Two goes into Special Applications such as Combat Sports, Arm Wrestling, Weight Loss, etc.  Section Three goes into actual Kettlebell Techniques.  Section Four finishes the book off with some Classic Kettlebell Programs <br /> <br />One of the most impressive parts of this book and the reason I believe it earns its 5 stars is because of not only its complete history but also its fantastic breakdown of the foundational exercises through photographs. <br /> <br />This is a great starting point if you are interested in Kettlebells.  However, if you plan on continuing with kettlebell training I would recommend that you get a quality 16kg kettlebell & purchase Pavel's DVD also named \\"The Russian Kettlebell Challenge\\" <br />	2005-08-22

I would have to say that this book coupled with John Grisham's \\"Bleachers\\" give the readers a truly accurate portrayal of athletics, more specifically, Football in small towns. <br /> <br />Bissinger's running commentary in regards to the history of the surrounding towns was rather effective to express what was going on in eyes of the locals who were witnessing what you were reading firsthand.  If you read the book without this background you receive a very different perspective on the events taking place. <br /> <br />My only criticism of this book would come in the ending.  I believe that a perfect book leaves the reader with closure yet still wanting more.  This book didn't quite seem to hit that balance.  The final pages listing what happened to some of the players profiled in the book seemed to be lacking on some players while well defined with other players.  I don't know if this information was just not available or if the author selectively chose what would come in.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a fantastic book that would be a great addition to any home library.	2005-08-17

I'll be honest as a law student and a big Grisham fan I was hesitant to read \\"A Painted House.\\"  However after reading \\"Bleachers\\" I quickly overcame my fear of Grisham's new style.  I guess it just took a little bit of faith.  Personally I am not a big fan of sequels but I really would like to see one in this case.  Grisham does a great job of character development in this book.  He sucks you in and leaves you wanting more so you know the next installment in the characters lives.    Grisham has now written about three things I know about (Law, Football, and Farming).  So far he has delivered dead on classics in all three of these categories.  I think he has now proven that he is one of the better writers of our time.  I can't wait to read more of what have been heralded as his \\"lawyerless\\" stories	2005-07-22

Jance and her detective JP Beaumont for quite some time now.  Not only are her mysteries top rate but her realistic setting in parts of Seattle are amazing.  If you are from Seattle you have to read all of the books in the Beaumont series.  I'm especially proud of the way she has memorialized the Doghouse, a popular Seattle restaurant that has since been closed. <br /> <br />This specific book is the 10th in the Beaumont series.  It involves the murder of a fellow SPD officer and his family.  Detective Beaumont teams up with Junior, the only family survivor, as well as Internal Affairs in an effort to get to the bottom of the murders.  In this book Jance also gives a special recognition to local Seattle Radio Station KLSY and the Teddy Bear Patrol.  Two fantastic organizations who have done a lot of good in the greater Seattle Community.   <br />	2005-07-20

I have been hacking at the ball for a couple of years now, not really knowing what I'm supposed to be doing exactly.  I wanted to learn but I didn't want to spend money for a guy to tell me that I didn't have a clue what I was doing.  This book gives you a great grasp of the fundamentals so that you may go to the driving range or go take lessons without feeling ashamed.  Every time you pick up this book you will glean a little bit more from each lesson.  The diagrams are great and the summary at the end of all the lessons is priceless.  This is a must have for every beginning golfer.  It's not to expensive and can even fit nicely in your golf bag for last minute tips.	2005-07-20

It wasn't until after the movie announcements that I realized it was still MIA and decided to hunt down a new copy.  This volume more than makes up for my missing original. <br /> <br />This volume is quite the find.  Whether you are a big Hitchhiker's guide enthusiast or you just want to see what all the fuss is about this is the volume for you.  It contains five different books in the series, one short story as well as a foreword/history that will give you a greater understanding of the history of the books and radio shows.  If you are having trouble deciding between different editions, this is the one for you. <br /> <br />I have yet to see the movie so I cannot compare.  I can't say I'm surprised that it didn't live up to the book.  It's hard for movie producers to beat or meet readers own imaginations.     <br />	2005-06-26

It's shorter chapter style is similar to the new fad used by many recent authors such as Dan Brown.  I think the shorter chapters lead to the inability to put down these books as you keep trying to squeeze in one more chapter before going to do something else.  The storyline was well conceived and the characters were great.  I wished Preston would have done more character development up front.  I found towards the middle of the book I would have to flip back and forth between chapters to try and figure out who certain minor characters were.  I quickly pulled it together and figured it out.  It is a great little book that keeps you guessing right up to the end.  This mass-market paperback is definitely worth your time.  I look forward to reading other titles by Mr. Preston.	2005-06-23

I didn't expect a stellar piece of work or anything comparable to Angels and Demon's or the Da Vinci Code.  Yet this book still offered a mind-numbing, quick adventure to pass the time.  I doubt that I will ever read this book again but it was interesting while it lasted.  The storyline wasn't all that developed and unfortunately the author chose to go overboard on plot twists rather then develop his characters at length.  If you are looking for something to read to pass the time this book is great.  If you are looking for something more intellectually stimulating you might want to pass on this book.	2005-05-31

Many authors have sought to break it down and discuss its meaning through a variety of devotionals but Max Lucado delivers.  I am slightly biased as a fan of Lucado's work but this little book is absolutely breathtaking.  Safe in the Shepard's Arms is a fairly quick read and can be read straight through or used as a devotional.  The way Lucado dissects each phrase makes this a great tool for teens and young adults.  The illustrations just help add to an already great book.	2005-04-16

I picked it up as a cheap paperback at a gift shop and know I will treasure this book forever.  Overall it is a quick read.  My only problem with this book is the characters dialogue.  I know the author is a professional but the conversations between characters were occasionally somewhat choppy and forced.  This slight miscue is not enough to knock it down from 5 stars.	2005-01-06

I do not condone simply reading it and believing verbatim what is said.  However I would still encourage you to buy this and read it.  It is a part of history and who we know are.  It's about why things have changed.  Reading it made me think of how going to the airport and our lives as American's might be different if the events on 9/11 hadn't happened.  Now that the price is coming down there is no real excuse for not getting this.  I personally feel that the commission did a good job of putting this all together.

I've used several of the monologues from this book with great success.  There are some classics as well as some more obscure monologues.  I would recommend adding this book to your collection of monologues or to use in the classroom for students who are having trouble finding material.	2004-11-14

It focused on people's lives, relationships, and small town habits instead of a courtroom deliberation.  It was refreshing.  It touched on some very delicate issues such as desegregation of schools and corruption of politicians while at the same time being entertaining and predominantly light.  In addition this is one of the few Grisham books with a solid ending.  By basing the story on the newspapers existence it gives the book a more structured timeline.  I feel this is one of Grisham's best books.  For those of you who are avid Grisham fans you should try and see how many names and personalities you recognize from some of his other books.	2004-11-13

Guilty!  Maybe it was my guilty conscious, or maybe it was the condescending tones that rang throughout this book.  Some of the funny stories may have helped me to remember a couple of the rules.  For the most part this book is a compilation of the author's complaints about people like me.  I wouldn't recommend this book as a teaching aid, nor would I recommend it for its humor.  I'm honestly not sure what I would recommend this book for.	2004-10-18

While no part of this book is in depth it is a good starting point for children doing research or who want more of a compilation of scientists and their contributions.  Overall I think this book is a very effective book for the younger generation or for someone who just wants to read some quick facts about Christian scientists.	2004-10-14

I have talked to quite a few people who felt this was terrible because it was inaccurate religiously or historically.  The bottom line is it's a book.  People felt the same way about some of the Indiana Jones movies but now those are considered classics in American Society.  While I don't think this will reach that mark I think it is a good fictional book.  The characters are interesting, and the plot as well as the twists are well thought out.  The logic puzzles involved in the journey are much more challenging then they were in the Da Vinci Code.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who just wants an entertaining read not someone who is searching for the truth hidden in literature.	2004-10-14

The history contained in these pages comes alive as you take an illustrated walk though the best private college in Washington.  It does an incredible job memorializing the first 100 years of the existence of Saint Martin's and gives many interesting facts that even students and faculty are unaware of.
