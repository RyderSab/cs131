The hero isn't much of a hero, just a man struggling with the pressures of economic success in contrast to his moral beliefs.<br />With over 90% of the grocery stores today being multi-store operations, we see in this book the beginnings of the Madison Avenue economy we live in today, and what has been lost in the process.<br />At least Hawley struggled against the tide, where today it has become almost chic to lack morals, fool consumers, be the trickster guru, or market a ton of air in attractive colors and graphics.<br />Steinbeck shows us it should be a struggle, and indeed it will be a difficult one in a cultural setting where rationalizations (&quot;It's only a crime against money - afterall!&quot;) eat away at the social requirements of honesty, decency, and respect for your fellow men and women.<br />At the end, a symbolic clue leads the reader back to a previous chapter and obscure dialogue. Left to ponder what this really means.	2004-01-20

He put effort in this work beyond what I can imagine.<br />My favorite part is the Mailman delivering the letter!<br />It may be more for men than women, and perhaps men over forty-five. <br />The book is about rugged American independence, but even more about strength in your convictions, and this is the lesson our protagonist learns.	2003-12-28

The book was fascinating, but not nearly so much as the different opinions about the book and its meaning.<br />And so here is my theory: The Confidence Man is not a shape-shifter. In fact, there is no character in the book we could call the Confidence Man. The con is within ourselves, an intrinsic part of our natures. We are not conned we con ourselves. Perhaps best illustrated in the part where Melville talks about writing.<br />In the end, how do you choose the outcome? You will take a walk in the dark, whether it be with faith or fear.	2003-12-27

I can remember the brown clouds rising up and sweeping over our home, even in Oklahoma City in the early 1950's. And the stories from my parents and grandparents who stayed in Oklahoma through the depression, and the stories from my grandmother who moved to California looking for work, but it wasn't until 1967 when I was in the Navy in San Diego situations would inspire me to read this book.<br />Even today in California, being called an &quot;Okie&quot; is not a compliment. It is said with a derogatory note of disdain akin to so many other predjudicial nicknames, and you really don't feel the entire impact unless one is directed at you.<br />What was this about? Why was there such an attitude towards people from Oklahoma? A friend told me I would find the answers in this book. It was in reading this book I lost my naivete about the depth of human prejudice and callousness. It was this book that inspired me to participate in civil rights demonstrations when the Navy transfered me to Mississipi. It was this book that woke me up!<br />I will always be grateful to Steinbeck for the skill to tell a story such as this, and I can only hope it's message will endure through all time.	2003-12-25

Today I read the other reviews, and I can understand their opinions, but think another perspective should be added. I'm sure my Japanese is not nearly as good as the other reviewer, and I don't live in Japan. Still, here is my opinion.<br />Translations are difficult in any language. Working on some very simple translations I found them most challenging. For example, the word Kobunboku I translated as Plum Blossom. If you translate the Kanji singularly and literally it would be Nice Prefered Wood. But if you understand the symbolic compounds it reads \\"The famous tree of Chinese literature\\" the flower of peace, the plum blossom. Most Japanese people would not recognize this literary compound. In reality no translation is perfect. In the version of one of these proverbs I have: \\"Fallen blossoms don't return to the branch. . .\\" It includes: \\"There is no sense in crying over spilt milk.\\"<br />As far as testing them on Japanese friends, and average Japanese people having not heard them. . .would this be less common with English idioms? The South has many idioms people in the North have never heard. \\"He's drunker than Cooter Brown\\" \\"Penny wise, Pound foolish\\" I never heard till I was 40. <br />I would add I don't think it is a good idea to try and use these proverbs to impress Japanese speakers. Contrivance is rarely respected.<br />I greatly appreciated the author including the Kanji, Romanji, Hiragana, and English, and I think the book is helpful and a lot of fun to read with some nice thoughts to reflect on their wisdom.<br />PS: The title \\"IS\\" Even Monkeys Fall From Trees :)	2003-12-19

He was signing copies of this book and I bought one then and one later.<br />I've read several of Roshi's books, but this one impressed me the most. Maybe it's more about imperfection than perfection, and the title may scare people who think there is no way they will ever be perfect at anything.<br />This isn't what the book is about.

As Ryokan notes himself, outside his Zen, he has no Poetry to offer. <br />Ryokan refusing to take a position of a Zen Abbot, instead goes back to the place of his youth and takes hermitage. &quot;The cold wind gathers enough fallen leaves to build my fire.&quot;<br />His code of living avoids flattery as much as objuragation, he teaches with a tear, plays with children, and falls in love with a young nun. All of this brings forward our own starkling humanity!<br />Stephens does a master presentation in bringing this material together in such an artful way as to illuminate all sides of Ryokan with that of the reader themselves.

In the development of most Iemoto systems a loosely based and often fictious history is created, what the Chinese called \\"Leaning on the Ancients.\\" However, these histories don't usually withstand the test of time and academic scrutiny.

It's amazing how so many of the people writing negative reviews on this book are focused on what they see as moral or philosophical content. <br />They seem to miss the fact that Lady Murasaki was writing in the context of the society at that time, and exploring those same moral conflicts within the reality of both society and individual consciousness. Genji is not a hero placed on a pedestal, Murasaki examines him in the most honest way, showing both the good and the bad, the beauty and the beast; and that's what makes it such a great novel. It has integrity of subject rarely seen in our modern formulas and Hollywood endings.<br />In modern texts the writing formulas is a hero who goes through a series of climaxes, culminating in a victory or defeat where the protagonist discovers something about themselves, but with Genji, the reader discovers something about themselves, and maybe that's too disturbing for some people.<br />In addition, it passes on an abundance of information on Japanese history and culture of the Heian area. It is a significant work relating to the Japanese Incense Ceremony called Kodo, of which today the most famous game is called \\"Genji Koh\\" or \\"Incense of the Genji.\\"	2003-10-08

Training takes up to 30 years to master the art.<br />However, anyone can read this book and begin learning and practicing the art. It includes fun quessing games called kumiko, and they range from very simple contests of guessing three different aromas, to very complex games requiring knowledge of Japanese history, poetry, and geography.

It should be of particular interest to those interested in the Japanese Incense ceremony. <br />Ms. Kiyoko Morita takes the reader on a wonderful tour of the history of the \\"Incense Culture\\" in Japan. She takes the complex and extensive subject of Kodo (The Way of Incense) and skilfully organizes the most important areas. <br />You may not master the art of kodo from reading this book, but all the information is there to learn how to enjoy incense prepared kodo style, as well as how to give an incense party, and begin understanding the associated culture.	2003-08-18
