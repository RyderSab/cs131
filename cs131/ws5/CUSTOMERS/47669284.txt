Emma again hits the heights in this genre,  somehow wedding insightful characterizations with friggin hot sex.  Personal Assets is, hands down (and ass up!) the best she's offered so far.

Great analysis has been done in other reviews, but for me, this novel represents an epic, violent struggle between Man (in the form of 14year-old nameless Kid) and the Devil, aka The Judge, with the blood-drenched American West as backdrop. The Kid is a soulless creature, born and raised in violence, but even one such as he stands in stark contrast to the Judge, an intellectual killer, a compassionate madman. The language is dense but poetic, and has made me a McCarthy fan for life. Great read.	2005-03-24

Emma does it again-  marrying the oddest worlds into one unforgettable steamy tale.  Demons in Victorian (sorta) London with enhanced humans doing battle with them... and having hot sex to boot? Very few people could pull this off (name one besides Holly?) but this author does it with style.  It was too quick a read, but very enjoyable.

The only reason I'm giving it four stars is because it gets EVEN better as the series continues.   This opener though has just about everything a sci-fi chick like me could hope for --  it's profane, humorous, has a simple premise with some GOOD twists, love, sex, winged demons, warrior angels, serial killers and of course...

This is an amazingly rich story filled with interesting and tragic characters.  The story spans almost forty years of a woman's life, and the action never stops thanks to three husbands, three towns, a hurricane, and a murder trial. Characters range from the frivolously humorous to the intense, and the dialogue is at times witty and insightful. Filled with numerous tensions, conflicts and cliff hangers, no wonder they attempted to make this a movie-- too bad the tv version didn't do this fine novel justice. <br /> <br />The premise, that a 40 year old woman looks back on her life filed with love and tragedy is simple and told in a clear, straightforward manner.  The author thoroughly explores a human being's search for identity through a unique character -- a black woman in the 1930s. Janie struggles to find love and watches it either melt away, change or try to kill her, but she grows stronger with each experience.   <br /> <br />Janie arcs nicely from a wild, undisciplined girl to a woman who will stand by her lover even in the face of death. Her husbands are well drawn, though the first husband and third, Tea Cake were the most interesting.  The story only lags a bit during her long relationship with Joe, her second husband.   Secondary characters, such as the gossipy townfolk and the three men who hang on Janie's porch telling tales, are classics, providing humor and warmth to this otherwise harsh tale. The relationship between Janie and Tea Cake is filled with tension and drama, and will bring audiences back for more: is Tea Cake just after her money? Will he gamble away her life savings? Will they survive the hurricane? Who will have to kill who first?  Thanks Ms. Hurston for an amazing tale. <br />	2005-03-20

This series has grown on me, book after book, and hats off to Ms. Harris for really  shaking things up in the Bill/Sookie romance.  I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books, but wondered how many more times the author would re-tread the relationship, when BANG! she has Bill do the unthinkable!  I do like Bill, but bravo to Ms. Harris for creating such other delectable alternatives for Sookie, namely Eric and Alcine the werewolf.  Yum!   <br /> <br />The plot was zippy and twisty, though Sookie got pummeled into the dirt one time too many.   Not a big fan of the resolution, but boy did I have fun getting there.

I hate to slam an author's hard work (658 pages can't have come easy) but MAN did this book suck.  I have been an Anita fan since Guilty Pleasures, but found I REALLY enjoyed the series when it took a darker turn, around Obsidian Butterfly.   Cerulean Sins was great, because when Anita really started to feed the ardeur, at least she was doing it (literally) with characters I had come to know and like.  The pairings were interesting and compelling, and I couldn't WAIT to see how the delicious menage a trois between Anita, Asher and Jean Claude would play out, how they would battle the big Bad Mother of All Darkness, and what that would mean in their relationship with Belle Morte.  So many delicious threads left dangling, and twelve excruciating months to wait....then finally the wait was over! Incubus Dreams was at last here!  <br /> <br />Cut to 658 pages and 200 typos later, and here I sit horrified and dumbfounded.  What the holy (insert Anita's favorite expletive here) was this??  It was as if Cerulean Sins never existed!  All those threads I mentioned?  Still dangling.  No room to address them when you've got 500 pages of talky porn to write!  <br /> <br />Yes, before Anita and her lovers (some of them strangers introduced a mere half a page before Anita goes all ardeur on them) have sex, they TALK ABOUT IT for at least TWO CHAPTERS beforehand.  Perhaps Anita must feed the  &#34;talkeur&#34; before the &#34;ardeur&#34;.  Though the sex is pretty hot, you'll be amazed that the lovers haven't talked themselves into a coma first.   Like all die-hard Anita fans, I was expecting another great read.  Instead, here's what I got. <br />  <br />100 pages of unresolved mystery story,  <br />200 pages of psychoanalytical musings (of the &#34;Richard loves to hate himself more than he loves to love me!&#34; variety).    <br />150 pages of sex with people you could care less about.  <br />150 pages of sex with people you DID care about but now can't stand anymore.    <br /><br />The character work is repetitive, with only one spark of interest--Nathaniel.  His character arc is nice, and is the only reason I'm giving this book two stars instead of one. <br /> <br />Jean Claude? morphs into an emasculated Machiavelli.   <br />Richard?  a spineless repressed prude, no matter how many three-ways he's in.  <br />Asher? Missing in action.  <br />Jason? Harmless brother-figure.  <br />Micah? still a well-endowed yes man.  <br />Nathaniel? Surprisingly still interesting.  <br />Damian? Quickly-forgotten sextoy.   <br />Requiem and Byron? (&#34;Who?&#34; you ask?) Two unknowns who get more action than poor Asher. <br /> <br />Save your time, your expectations and your twenty bucks.  Donate it instead to Proofreaders of America, or any organization that could help LKH find a decent editor.   Sorry to vent, but man am I pissed at spending hard-cover money on this! &#62;:(	2004-10-10

Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister is moving, poignant drama filled with magic, adventure, wit and subtlety.  What a fantastic read!<br />It begins with an old crone listening to children in the street reciting the fairy tale CINDERELLA, and realizing that they must be speaking of *her* family, but the story has been bastardized, butchered beyond recognition.  This is how it \\"really\\" happened, from the point of view of the crone, one of the two so-called wicked step sisters.  And what an absolute joy to read. Stripping the fairy-tale of it's magic mice and fairy godmothers allows for true issues of self-worth to be addressed, along with a good dose of romance and wit.  <br />The story is cleverly plotted, coming up with mundane explanations for the magic in the fairy-tale, while telling the unique tale of the compassionate step-sister who is instrumental in her two sisters' development. The tension within the story is palpable and utterly credible.  Iris, an awkward teen, fears her looks and the scary magic she perceives lurking around her in her new home and her new country. Clara's confrontation with \\"Wicked Step Mother \\"Margarethe is the story's driving conflict, and all the reasons behind the Margarethe's behavior are rivetingly explained.<br />Iris has a good, true heart, but must overcome her low esteem and fight her mother's tyranny to find love.  Clara, too must come to terms with her looks, which she deems just as much a curse as Iris' ugliness.  Her search for courage and competence after being raised as a porcelain doll is a valuable lesson to put across to readers without being preachy.<br />Margarethe is a formidable villain to every character in the story, capable of taking them all on with cunning.  The writing is quick, intelligent and humorous and filled with menace, at all the right moments. Yum yum yum.  Can't wait to read Wicked.  Bravo!	2004-02-06

The set up-- that a young Druid Priestess shares a forbidden love with a half-breed Roman soldier that threatens to destroy both their worlds-- promises gory battles, love scenes, triumphs and tragedy.  Marion Zimmer Bradley delivers all in spades.  Focusing primarily on the females characters, she does a great job of arcing the main character, Eilan from care-free child to Warrior-Priestess.  Zimmer Bradley gives us an interesting, extremely dense story that mixes action, magic and romance into a female-empowering tale.  The characters are fairly sympathetic, especially when suffering frustrated love pangs, and thesub plots are just as intriguing as the main story line.  <br />Though the story sometimes strays too much into Female Empowerment Land (thanks to chapters devoted to menstrual blood rites and spell casting),   Forest House presents lots of cliffhangers and surprises.  MUCH better than its sequel, LADY OF AVALON.	2004-02-04

After reading so many glowing reviews of THE PERSIAN BOY and after being told that it could be read as a stand-alone book from Renault's Alexander Trilogy, I was anxious to jump right in. But at the last minute decided to read part one, FIRE FROM HEAVEN first. And I'm so glad I did.  Not only does the first book give you a thorough grounding in the history of Alexander's youth and the conquests of his father Philip of Macedon, it also sets up the first leg of the romance triangle between Alexander, his boyhood soulmate Hephastion, and Bagoas, the \\"Persian Boy\\".      While FIRE FROM HEAVEN is well written, fast-paced and thread through with betrayal, Oedipal intrigue, battlelust and romance, it really just lays the ground work for Renault's masterpiece, THE PERSIAN BOY.  This book was an incredible read.  Bagoas' narration makes this novel utterly engaging from the first sentence. (I DARE you to read the first paragraph of this book and put it aside!)  Bagoas is, at turns heroic, petty, brave, self-preserving and selfless-- in sum: a fully fleshed out character with flaws and claws, and an absolute pleasure to know.  This is a great read on its own, but you'll feel the joys and sorrows of the characters tenfold if you take the time to read Fire From Heaven first.	2004-01-30

This novel is a wonderful tale of music and the passion of lives fully lived...and the pain to which that fullness is wed. What thrilling, erotic read.  This is the story of an 18th century castrato who is torn between getting revenge against those who mutilated him...or rising above that-- with his angelic voice and impossible good looks-- to become Italy's next opera star.  <br />Rice steeped her novel in betrayal, obsession, the drive for revenge, the lust for power, and the need of a astarved soul to find love.  But beyond all these \\"bodice-ripper\\" adjectives, Cry to Heaven is at its heart an unflinching character study of a man who has his manhood stolen from him, and of how his mind has to twist in on itself to cope with this loss.  <br />Ms. Rice's protagonist, Tonio Treschi is wonderfully nuanced, and we get to see into his tortured soul at every step of his journey-- from the confused and unfocused pain of being castrated, to the cold, focused revenge on the one responsible.  Masterful!  Add to this the lush backdrop of the intrigue of the opera scene in Naples, Venice, Milan and Rome...well, this is truly a feast. And I ate every morsel.  After reading this novel, you'll felt like you've earned a PhD in musicology, opera seria, and Italian political history-- it's that detailed.  But the details NEVER bog down the story, just make it richer and richer.    Again, bravo, bravo Anne Rice!	2004-01-28

The characters and relationships are very intriguing-the author's world is filled with both obvious and subtle villains, as well as obvious and subtle heroes.  Candice herself is fun, likeable and strong enough to give as good as she gets.  Though she is being constantly second-guessed, undermined and underestimated, she ends up turning her \\"weakness\\" into advantage time and again.  The author sets up the rivalry between the FBI and the DEA and her unique role walking between the two. Highly recommended.	2003-12-22

Overall, DARWIN'S RADIO is a super smart thriller that at times gets quagmired in it's own science but whose story is riveting nonetheless.  Characters are well defined,  the stakes are clear, and the conflicts are layered.  There's even a romance, which is woven skillfully into the main story.  Though a Ph.D. in infectious diseases may be required to read the novel, the science can be boiled down to a few key, easily understandable steps that we all can grasp. This is for smart readers hungering to use their brains to decipher mysteries... and has enough sex, explosions and icky alien babies thrown in to amuse the rest of us!<br />The story's premise is exciting:  three scientists stumbling upon a virus whose mission at first appears to be to wipe mankind off the face of the earth, but it may turn out that we're being prepared for the next stage in our evolution. Bear explores the fear, excitement, greed, desperation, hatred, love, and lust for power that stems from a scientific breakthrough.  Ethical, moral and religious questions are also discussed when mass abortion seems to be the solution to a deadly epidemic.  Author also explores the deep divisions that arise between men and women, as each segregate, blaming the other for the onset of the phenomenon.  All in all, a great read.	2003-12-22

The real life characters seem much larger than life here, and not the one's you'd expect.  Issues of that time resonate in our own, including racism, Hollywood's role in shaping national morality, ageism, drug addiction, homophobia and meglomania.  <br />Unfortunately, David Selznick is a very unsympathetic character.  He's troubled, undisciplined, unwittingly cruel, irrational-and those are his endearing qualities!  Though the author takes pains to show that Selznick was always apologetic after he flew off the handle, there is no soft side to warm this character up a bit.  He is reminiscent of Charles Foster Kane but with no love interest but a wife who stays completely out of sight.  <br />Vivien Leigh is just as complex, living a life filled with scandals-she was living out of wedlock with Laurence Olivier, which had to be kept a complete secret from press and public.  She was British, and many thought it a crime that a non-Southerner, let alone a non-American play Scarlett.  But her determination closely mirrors Scarlett O'Hara's in single-mindedly getting just what she wanted.  Over all, a good overview of the making of a classic.	2003-12-22

Overall, KAHAWA, is an uneven yet action-packed adventure with something for everyone: sex, adventure, a really evil villain, manly heroes and beautiful courageous heroines of all colors.    Our mercenary heroes are striking a blow against tyranny, but they aren't looking for the Ark, or the Grail or King Solomon's Mines. They're stealing coffee.  But that's what's kinda cool about it.  <br />The premise,  that a mixed bag of mercenaries, for profit and for politics, decide to hijack Idi Amin's coffee train, worth six million dollars,  is very inventive.  Westlake allows his characters to be heroic for monetary reasons and for ideology: Idi Amin's a tyrant and all want to see him go down....and making a buck or two from his downfall will make it all the sweeter.	2003-12-22

This biography is filled to the brim with Bogie wise-cracks and witticisms, making him an endearingly warm, if flawed, protagonist.  His marriage with Mayo is fascinating, filled with passion, melodrama, danger and heartbreak.  Sadly, all Mayo's dramatics do not gain her eternal love-she is instead dumped for a 19 year old Bacall.  Though the author goes on to describe Bacall's ingenuity at taming her wild husband, he doesn't go a good job of showing if anything besides youth and beauty attracted Bogie in the first place.  <br />Since Bogie didn't meet Bacall until he was 45, and had had several amazing adventures in his youth, Bacall's entrance seems to come in after all the good times have rolled.  His life with her was still filled with pranks and drinks and glamour, but it was a more sober, reflective time for him, particularly with the onset of fatherhood and cancer. Though Bogie is a larger than life character-funny, sexy, dangerous, romantic and timeless-- his most exciting years were with a woman who wasn't the love of his life.	2003-12-22

Overall, PATIENT NUMBER ONE is a compelling, dramatic true story that is fast-paced and socially relevant.  Though story's most intense moments are played out over laboratory beakers and in the pages of patent infringement law-it's a fascinating read.   The subject matter is on par with films like THE INSIDER, bringing to light some very ugly but very timely truths about big business and our legal system.<br />The premise-- that a CEO whose life was saved by the very technology his company invented, must battle big business to save that same company- is a true David vs. Goliath story, but one with a bittersweet ending.   <br />The people in the story are very compelling, mostly because of the hardships they face and overcome, rather than because of their uniqueness or likability.  For example, the protagonist Richard is a rather bland corporate executive, and one who was lucky enough to be in exactly the right place when cancer struck.  I empathize with him only because of the complete unfair tactics that are waged against him, not because I necessarily identify with a CEO of a tech firm.  The most interesting characters are the scientists at CellPro in charge of saving their boss' life.  This task and its pressures are the most riveting aspects of the book, and make for a brilliant read.	2003-12-22

Overall, LOST is a very compelling, dark thriller with real, intense characters and a few unique plot twists.  The dialogue is for adults, very hard edge, and utterly lacking in quick quips.  Reminiscent of COPLAND, LOST gets involved in the gritty realities of small town (or in this case small island) politics, filled with long-standing jealousies that the author does a wonderful job of illuminating.  The structure is tight, though menace could be added to two of the villains in order to heighten tension.  <br />The premise-- that a beautiful widow's child is kidnapped by thugs on a Mediterranean isle,  and only a scarred police chief, who is already embroiled in a life long battle with the island mafia, can  help her-is so well- conceived and executed that even the seeming cliches seem fresh and new.  There are two protagonists, Stuart and Alice, and each are deeply flawed individuals who must overcome their personal demons to find Alice's son.  The progression of their romantic relationship is subtle and believable though ultimately tragic.  On the whole, a great read.	2003-12-22

It's a riveting, action-packed adventure tale filled with gritty heroes and villains, and fascinating settings, both grim and glorious.  The protagonist is a fabulous anti hero, a cross between Indiana Jones and a character straight out of HBO's prison drama Oz.<br />The characters are so well defined, from the sadistic warden to prisoners Ed and Jack, whom we never really see, and only know through intricate, faceless conversations.  The lead character, Darrell Standing,  is wily, handsome, intrincsically good, but hardened and made cruel by the warden's treatment.  Charming and dangerous, he's just the sort of bad-boy we love to root for.  Ed and Jack, his two fellow prisoners, are perfect foils, one believing and encouranging, the other skeptical but reluctanly fascinated nonetheless.  The warden makes a formidable, multi-faceted villain, at turns weak and cruel, and inventive in his tortures.  What a wonderful read!	2003-12-22

Overall, GOOD COUNSEL is a very well-told story with poignant moments, but the over arching theme-a lawyer's moral decline- has been handled in a more complex fashion elsewhere, and isn't the shocking journey the author believes it to be.  Today's jaded readers already have little illusions about the law, so finding out a lawyer lied isn't an interesting revelation on which to base an entire story.<br />The premise--that a lawyer's willingness to bend the truth leads him deeper into trouble, ultimately forcing him to go on the run-isn't a particularly exciting one.  Similar movies have used the same premise but married it to a more thrilling story: for example the FIRM or DEVIL'S ADVOCATE also show lawyers going more and more over the line, but take the story a step further.  Here, the author is singularly concerned with his moral decline and redemption, which would be fine, if the cases he chose to illustrate it weren't so textbook LAW &amp; ORDER.  Unfortunately, readers of the genre will have seen every one of these cases before.	2003-12-22

Overall, YOUNG MEN WITH UNLIMITED CAPITAL is a hilarious, quirky, action-filled story with wry, sympathetic characters who get themselves embroiled in excruciating yet hysterical situations.  Dialogue, peppered with 60's &quot;love child&quot;-speak is biting and funny. The climax, the festival itself is full of misadventures, last minute, death-defying heroics and happy endings all around.  <br />The premise-- that two men with a lot of money but little direction get in over their heads when planning a massive rock concert-- opens the doors for alot of funny behind-the-scenes tales of woe.  That the backdrop is the most legendary music gathering in America's history only makes it more appealing. Though the piece has a decidedly slapstick tone, underlying themes of true friendship, the triumph of goodness, and the love of family are deftly woven in. What a pleasure to read!  And all capers are visually interesting and active, with witty dialogue or commentary running throughout.  Readers young, old, and nostalgic will have a great time with this.	2003-12-22

Overall, TENDER AT THE BONE is a lovely coming-of-age story with hilarious vignettes that could be woven into a heart-warming comedic drama.  All the elements are there, eccentric characters, witty dialogue, over-arching mother-daughter tension and a good meal.  The author's childhood is more fascinating, more poignant than her adult transitions, but entire films can be made from many of the short stories.  <br />Fantastic characters people this story,  including Ruth herself.  Her awkwardness and self-esteem issues are painfully obvious, and make her sympathetic and endearing.  She smoothly arcs from innocent child to rebel teen to competent woman. Good read!	2003-12-22

Written by the same author of October Sky, about the same period in his childhood, the COALWOOD WAY and OCTOBER SKY cover the exact same themes-a son trying to shine despite the disappointment/disapproval of his father, rocket trial and error, etc-and have the exact same arcs.  Minor characters and sub plots are different, however, and are very poignant and engaging.The protagonist, Sonny is an earnest boy with enough flaws to make him interesting.  He is smart yet a little too proud; a friend but sometimes too self-centered to see when his closest friends are in trouble; he's handsome yet can't get a date to the senior dance.  These imperfections make him the perfect Everyman, easy to root for.  Minor characters are well drawn, and some are heartbreaking to watch.  Dreama's tragic arc is painful but gives the story a darkness and depth.  Her ostracization by town snobs is well-depicted, and shows that the author didn't just sail through his childhood without noticing the little evils that men do.  Great read.	2003-12-22

Over all, CRAZY FOR TRYING is a well-written, if uneven,  story of a woman who must overcome a myriad of psychological punches from her past and present and still try to love someone even more damaged than she.  This starts out as a lighthearted TRUTH ABOUT CATS AND DOGS-style story, but does a 180 midway through to tackle every issue from homosexuality, to feminism, to abortion, to Vietnam, to drug and alcohol addiction, child abuse, spousal abuse, sexual harassment in the work place, to Alzheimer's, to leukemia. Sorry for all the movie references, but think NORMA RAE, TERMS OF ENDEARMENT and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.<br />The characters are extremely well developed, and due to the tremendous amounts of trauma they must face, every facet of the characters' character is explored.  Tulsa is painfully drawn as the obese, book-worm wallflower who, under the tutelage of life on her own and the love of a not-so-good man blossoms into a sturdy, strong-willed Montana rose. This is a believable transition to some extent, though her strength after Mac's crippling accident seemed to come from nowhere. Though Mac was also an interesting dysfunctional misfit, his fear of commitment rose and fell, and rather than arced. Over all, a good read.	2003-12-22

THE SECRET OF CHIMNEYS will appeal to those who are bored with the \\"dead body in the sitting room, which of the dinner party did it?\\" formula. The stakes are very high,  the plot is engrossing, and the end, hard to predict. It's a story told on a vast scale, and it will exact a high demand of focused attention from its audience.  Were this to be made into a film, it should be on the scale of MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS, large, long and opulent. Anthony Cade is a magnetic character; clever and levelheaded in the face of danger. Virginia Revel does not at first seem like a worthy love interest. She babbles on about her figure and shopping, and loves it when men are infatuated with her; it's a major ego boost. She needs to be more than a beautiful young socialite for the reader to want her and Anthony together. Battle is a wonderful detective; so smart that we will trust his every instinct, and the relationship between he and Anthony takes on an intriguing Holmes/Watson aspect.  Good read.	2003-12-22

Overall, A LITLE BIT MARRIED is an engaging family drama that is more reflective than eventful. The writer displays sharp insight into human psychology and the dynamics of marriage and family. A lot of her humor is aimed at poking fun at the trappings of suburban life. Unfortunately, the plot unfolds at a sluggish pace.  The premise-- that a woman gave up a promising acting career to raise a family in the suburbs, and in the midst of a marital crisis, has the chance to start over at age 38-is, by now familiar.  Each member of the family is in the throes of a major life crisis, and the story is reminiscent of a number of recent tales of family dysfunction: AMERICAN BEAUTY being the most notable.	2003-12-22

I just finished this book a few minutes ago, and while still wiping tears from my eyes, I had to come sing its praises.  The coming together of these two central characters, Jacob, the narrator and Ferris, his lover/nemesis/master/servant-- has tragedy written on it from the beginning.  But oh how sweet the pain! Be warned, this book will devastate you. But you will be a better person for reading it.  Though the main character is self-destruction personified, the author shows us the seed of his every torturous action.  Jacob's rage and his cunning, his obsession and his madness make his moments of kindness and peace all the more poignant.  The reader knows that these moments are just calms before the storm.  I turned each page, terrified and compelled to continue reading.  I haven't been this moved by a novel since Cormac McCarthy's Blood Meridian.  Bravo, Ms. McCann!	2003-11-24
