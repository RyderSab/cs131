I haven't seen the new one, but this one is fabulous.  It's fun to read and very informative.  I've been living in  my house for 8 years - and only this week changed the dryer vent hose (it  never occurred to me... ... and leaving it uncleaned was a FIRE HAZARD!).   I also learned that the carpenter bees attacking my house are a nuisance  and need attention, but not necessarily something to panic over.  Wish I'd  had something like this a LONG time ago.  Great book.	1999-03-24
US	52031981	R1BQ7HBEMVITZU	0385494238	654180128	Amsterdam	Books	1	4	6	N	N	Why did this win an award?  It was awful.	The publisher's description of the book intrigued me.  Knowing it had won an award, I thought it was a reasonably safe bet, so I ordered it. I am so very disappointed.  There are 4 main characters - a dead woman of  questionable morals (she's slept with everything that moves, but it's OK  because she's &quot;a nice person&quot; ???), two of her ex-lovers (who are  self-absorbed and mean-spirited), and a political figure who has a  &quot;dirty little secret&quot;.  The writing, at some points, is good, but  I just never found anything in any of the characters to make me care about  what happens to them.  And the ending, which is apparently supposed to be  either a) profound or b) witty or c) both (?) had about as much fizz as a  bottle of  7 up left open for a week.	1999-03-24

Month after month, Peter Mayle recants the adventures he and his wife have after making the decision to move to a place they'd visited on vacation - and always dreamed of living in.  Once  they arrive, things aren't quite - well, smooth.  This is a charming book -  one that is even more fun when you share it with a friend &quot;over  lunch&quot;!	1999-01-06

The author's description of what it's like to struggle up the side of a mountain, what the cold feels like, what it looks like,  and what a lack of sleep and oxygen do to you - all make for interesting  reading.  That would have been enough.  But wrap these details around the  human tragedy experienced, and you've got one great book.	1999-01-06

It includes tips (such as image  pre-loading) and using cascading style sheets, and is written in an  easy-to-follow format.  It's not a GREAT book, but certainly is useful.	1998-11-22

I saw a plaque dedicated to him in a children's hospital near Miami earlier this year and wondered why it was there.  Now I know the answer - and it surprised me.

I'd never even heard  of the AT, but now I feel a connection and affection for it because of the  wonderful stories in his book.  &quot;Walk in the Woods&quot; is about a  lot of things: fitness, conservation, friendship, growing up, learning to  laugh at oneself, and learning to deal gracefully with dreams and goals  that aren't met.	1998-10-13

The sample code is well  set up - you can see the JavaScript with the surrounding HTML (the  JavaScript is in red type, HTML is in black, so it's easy to spot) - much  easier to understand what is going on when you can see both together.  Too  many other books show &quot;snippets&quot; of code in isloation  and get  you confused easily.  Again - this book isn't the &quot;JavaScript Bible  from A-to-Z&quot;, but it doesn't pretend to be.  It's a good buy.	1998-10-13

I saw the reflections of so many so-called Christians that I know.  But the more I got into it, the more I was confronted by my own false pride and assumptions about the afterlife and how God sees us.  Reading this book was like the first time I read (and REALLY thought about) the Sermon on the Mount.	1998-01-12

If you are interested in ancient Egypt, but have never thought about the other contemporary civilizations, you'll love this.  Mr. Waltari does a beautiful job of describing everyday life in ancient Egypt, but then takes you far beyond it's boundaries.  And a thoroughly entertaining story, to boot!	1998-01-12

I thought the book presented some interesting ideas about the historical period, the motives of the people involved in the &quot;heresy upheaval&quot;, and so on.  I liked &quot;Return to Thebes&quot; for the same reason.   Not a great book, but certainly not &quot;trash&quot;	1998-01-12

I expected a dull, boring read and was very surprised.  Lorraine Fletchers' account of her child's first few years is heart wrenching and (at the same time) triumphant.  A must read for hearing parents of Deaf children.	1998-01-12

Yet the author is never condescending toward his reader.  Don't be fooled by the small size of this book.  There are a lot of ideas here.  Is there a flaw in Mr. Lewis' logic?  I couldn't find it.	1998-01-12

Personally, I'm hoping that the &quot;pre-tribulation&quot; folks are right.  But after reading this, I'm not so sure.

Well researched and thought out.  I'm not sure I agree with everything he said, but he really made me think.  Definitely something to check out if you are studying Revelation	1998-01-12

The language is beautiful. A couple of times I got lost in the descriptions, most notably in the scenes in the cave (I would have rated the book a 10, but I had to see the movie before I knew if she died or not...couldn't tell from the book, and I read that passage several times before I gave up).  If you likes stories to fall &quot;neatly into place&quot; and be more-or-less chronological, don't read this book.  If, however, you like interwoven plots and artfully crafted text, this is for you.	1998-01-12

Why did God make french fries taste so good if they are so bad for you?  What about diabetics?  What about pregnant women?   There are answers here.  12 months ago, I wore a size 16.

Although I found the language a bit more inflamatory than necessary (at times), Mr. Hunt seems to have a lot of points that need to be considered.  Even if you are &quot;pro-Roman Catholic&quot;, you should read this to see what the concerns/fears of some of the Protestant fundamentalists are.	1997-11-27
