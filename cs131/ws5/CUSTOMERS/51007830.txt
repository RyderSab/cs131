The rattle of a typewriter. The eye-watering smell of ink on a hot summer evening, press night. The taste of good whiskey, shared with an old friend at the other side of the desk. The clutter that seems to be the required dcor for any tradition-abiding hometown newspaper office.<BR> If there's one thing that author Robert Inman has down pat, it's the atmosphere of a community newspaper, circa 1944. <BR> And he uses that setting as an integral part of a story that is both comic and tragic, the story of Jake Tibbetts, the cranky owner/editor of a small-town southern weekly inherited from his grandfather, a Confederate war hero.  <BR> Jake and wife Pastine are raising their grandson, Lonnie, whose alcoholic, irresponsible father Henry is disowned, disinherited and thoroughly despised by Jake. Henry joined up with the National Guard. He's fighting in a hellhole called Bastogne. <BR> In the meantime, Jake handles all matters on the homefront in his usual manner, stubbornly and cynically trying to control friends, family and the town. <BR> &quot;Home Fires Burning&quot; is a story that surprises (the first chapter is a fooler), amuses with its cast of cornball characters, thrills with its flashbacks to the Civil War, and ultimately  delivers thought-provoking messages about honor, the futility of foolish pride, and forgiveness. <BR> It's worthy of your &quot;must read&quot; list.	2004-04-18

Lindbergh answers this question better than A. Scott Berg's \\"Lindbergh\\", a marvelous, smoothly-written biography that uses heretofore unavailable sources to chronicle the unimaginable ups and equally unimaginable downs of Mr. Lindbergh's life. <br /> The book is the first biography of Lindbergh that was written with the input and blessing of Lindbergh's family, including his widow, the noted author Anne Morrow Lindbergh. For the first time, the family granted unrestricted access to masses of material in the Lindbergh archives. <br /> After reading this book, one concludes that two extreme forces shaped this great man's destiny. <br /> The first was flight, taking off with his days as a barnstormer and airmail pilot, soaring with his courageous solo in a monoplane across the Atlantic, and coming to a soft but significant landing with the endeavors of his later life that involved not only aviation, but innovative projects in the fields of medicine and environmentalism. He also distinguished himself as an author (with, I suspect, the assistance of his wife, Anne, herself a talented writer.) In 1954, \\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\" the book won the Pulitzer Prize. It remains one of this country's most compelling, true-life adventure stories. <br /> The second force was fame, the scourge of this extremely private man's life. Keep in mind that this was no normal fame, but a fame that bordered on fanaticism. It was fame that directly related to the kidnapping and death of his infant son, the family's exile to Europe, and the scorching criticism directed Lindbergh's way for his anti-war stance in the years preceding World War 11.<br /> And although Mr. Berg's book was written with the cooperation of the Lindbergh family, it doesn't gloss over the consequences of his remote personality and long absences from home. Both had much to do with Anne Morrow Lindbergh's love affair with her doctor.<BR> <br /> Some day, I hope that an ambitious television network such as HBO creates a mini-series based on this captivating biography. There is no way that a single movie can do justice to the expanse of dramatic events and stunning accomplishments that made up the life of America's greatest hero. <br /> Here was a man. And here's a biography that does him proud.	2003-02-26

It's a masterwork that rates as Lucky Lindy's second great achievement.	2003-02-07

But perhaps &quot;write&quot; is the wrong term - &quot;think&quot; is better. Wow! can this man think. And then he is able to express those thoughts in a clear, eloquent and, most of all, honest way that is a treat to read.<br /> The book begins with a letter from the young, penniless author to a friend. At the time, Steinbeck was in isolation when he took a job as the winter caretaker of a lodge in Lake Tahoe. From there, he takes us along on a life journey through three marriages, financial success that always made him uncomfortable, fame that he often detested, Pulitzer and Nobel prizes, adventure in settings from the Sea of Cortez to Saigon. <br /> The insights are astounding. His lack of pretension in the midst of his success amazes.<br />Here was a sensitive, often gruff but completely honest man who was not afraid to reveal himself in total to the friends he cherished.	2001-12-20

The net effect is very similar to a John Grisham story, and that's not bad company.	2001-11-22

The editor, Richard Stolley, selected academic eggheads to write these pieces, and most of them read like bad chapters in bad textbooks.

Not only was she born into the &quot;greatest gift&quot; but her dad, J.D. Salinger, is perhaps the most revered writer ever of dysfunctional childhoods. <BR>  <br /> So you would figure, wouldn't you?, that Ms. Salinger would be a chip off the old blockhead.<br /> Well, she is a fine writer. A sensitive, intelligent, supra-introspective woman comes through in these pages. <br /> And it all comes back to the old man who, really, doesn't come off quite as weird as most of his literary fans picture him. As portrayed in Dream Catcher, he is definitely reclusive and self-exclusive, an intolerant perfectionist, and the latter quality seems to be the source of most of his daughter's psychological struggles. But, at the same time, he's certainly not the Howard Hughes of literature, as many people probably visualize. J.D. is a little nutty, a lot aloof, but more normal than you expect. <BR>  <br /> The weakness of this book is the grinding first one hundred pages, full of psychobabble and interminable footnotes that belong in a Doctoral Thesis, not a memoir. Some editor fell asleep at the switch, and should have convinced the author to throw it out or rewrite it. Ms. Salinger doesn't find her voice until after this century of manuscript, and when she does the narrative is a delight, a remarkable first person account of a celebrity's daughter who struggles to find, and then does find, her own identity. <br /> (Particularly memorable is a stark, harrowing, honest account of a teenager, Ms. Salinger, pregnant and all alone. The passage was taken from her diary in 1972.)<br /> In the opening of J.D. Salinger's &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;, Holden Caulfield, says, &quot;my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything personal about them . . . especially my father.&quot;<br /> So one can imagine the music of popping blood vessels in the remote New Hampshire countryside.  <br /> That's okay, because his daughter opened a few veins of her own to write this fine memoir.	2001-11-09

Examples: a man who writes a last letter before his hanging for participating in John Brown's Raid at Harper's Ferry; a WWII soldier who describes the horror of liberating the Dachau Concentration Camp; a Gold Star mother writes to her son, thirty years after his death in Vietnam.<br /> The editor also sets up the letters nicely with italicized lead-ins that provide historical perspective. <br /> As a whole, love of country is somewhat evident in these letters, but even more prominent and common is love of family. <br /> War represents the despicably vicious side of mankind, and it's a poignant irony that the experience yields some of the most tender, loving and eloquent phrasings ever placed on paper.	2001-10-09

Consider the stories from this collection as the Hardy Boys on an adult level. This is thin writing but fun nevertheless. <br /> There are ten stories in this book, and the quality varies. It gets off to a weak start with &quot;A Friend of a Hero&quot;, a yarn about a detective who investigates the murder of a buddy from the Korean War. It picks up with some good tales about boxers on the fix - &quot;Fighter's Fiasco and &quot;The Ghost Fighter&quot; - if you can believe in the latter case that one boxer so closely resembles the other that he can take his place in the ring. The best piece is &quot;Wings Over Brazil&quot; in which soldier of fortune Ponga Jim Mayo discovers some nasty Nazis have stolen his cargo ship and plan to overthrow the government of Brazil.<br /> In all cases, however, the stories entertain. If you have a need to think, read Steinbeck or Hemingway. If you have a need to take a mental vacation, you'll love L'Amour.	2001-09-22

However, I am lukewarm about &quot;Journal of a Novel,&quot; Steinbeck's daily account of the trials of writing his most difficult work, East of Eden, from January through October, 1951. <br />I was hoping that the journal, addressed to his good friend and editor Pascal Covici, would reveal much about Steinbeck the writer and the man.<br />However, there is very little of the former except repeated brief accounts of the self-doubt and ups and downs a writer endures while creating a long and complex piece of literature. There are only hints of the technical or mental processes involved his writing. <br />And the same applies to autobiographical information about this period of his life. There is a lot of the trivia of daily life without the real depth of observation and feeling that is shown in other books of his letters. <br />He was a master at letter writing, and to find and know the real John Steinbeck, I strongly suggest &quot;Steinbeck: A Life in Letters&quot; edited by Elaine Steinbeck and Robert Wallsten.	2001-09-20

This is a one of the great American stories that was made into an equally great American movie.<br />The book is set in Maycomb, Alabama, in the 1930s. Atticus Finch, a lawyer and a father, defends a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a poor white girl, Mayella Ewell. The narrative is in the voice of Jean Louise (Scout) Finch, Atticus daughter, who with her brother, Jem, and friend, Dill, endure the underlying outrage of the community when Mr. Finchs vigorously defends Tom Robinson. <br />In the meantime, a great mystery is solved, the mystery of Boo Radley, a &quot;malevolent phantom&quot; who lives in a ramshackle house just down the street from the Finches. Boo was never seen, but &quot;people said he existed . . . people said he went out at night when the moon was down, and peeped in windows . . . when peoples azaleas froze in a cold snap, it was because he had breathed on them . . . a baseball hit into the Radley yard was a lost ball and no questions asked.&quot;  <br />Theres not much more that I can add to the hundreds of other Amazon reviews about this Pulitzer prize-winning book, but a few bits of &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; trivia may be interesting to those who are fans of the book and movie. <br /> . The character of &quot;Dill&quot;  the imaginative boy who was Jem and Scouts best friend and neighbor  is modeled after author Harper Lees best childhood friend. (Dills character is developed in much more detail in the book.)  The friends name was Truman Capote, a boy who grew up to be one of Americas finest authors. Perhaps the friendship was forged because both children marched to a different drummer. Truman was effeminate and didnt fit in with other boys. Harper was a feisty tomboy who didnt fit in with other girls.  This friendship, developed in Monroeville, AL (Maycomb in the book) and which continued into adulthood, gives rise to one of the more interesting controversies in literature. Four decades later, Harper Lee has never penned another novel, just a few articles and essays. The style in many of the passages in To Kill a Mockingbird is very similar to that of Truman Capote.  Did Harper Lee write this novel? Or is it the work of Truman Capote?   Ms. Lee has been quoted as saying that she &quot;finds writing difficult.&quot;  But it is documented that she locked herself away in a flat in New York City for more than a year to write To Kill a Mockingbird. It is very likely that her story is expressed with the advice and help of her good friend. And whats wrong with that?   Harper Lee is still living in 2001 and remains an intensely private person. <br /> . Understandably, the book includes scenes and story lines that were not included in the movie. Scouts aunt, Miss Alexandra, who desperately wants Scout to behave like a young lady, plays a key role in the book after she moves in with the family.  She is non-existent in the movie. Neighbor Miss Maudies house burns down in the books story line  in the movie she is best remembered for the line of dialogue, &quot;There are some men in this world who were born to do our unpleasant jobs for us. Your fathers one of them.&quot; <br /> So, which is better - the book or the movie? <br /> The answer is neither. Theyre both masterpieces that complement and compliment each other beautifully.<br /> Every once in a very long while - in literature and filmmaking - a story comes along with a power of its own that seems to draw from an unworldly creative force. The result is a work of grace, beauty, insight and inspiration. Such is the case with To Kill A Mockingbird. <br /> On film or the printed page, its an American treasure.	2001-08-19

Scott Fitzgerald, John Steinbeck and Louis Bromfield.<br />Louis who?<br />  Although Mr. Bromfields novels never earned the long-term respect that was anointed on authors as Steinbeck or Hemingway, his story is as interesting as that of any author who lived during the twentieth century.<br /> He was one of the group of writers whose skills were honed in France in the roaring 20s (like Hemingway, he served as an ambulance drive in World War 1). He enjoyed critical and considerable financial success as a novelist. He won the Pulitzer at a young age for the novel Early Autumn. Several of his novels were adapted for the big screen. He was an adventurer, world traveler, pal to the rich and famous.<br />But in the midst of this success, deep down he longed to return to the farmland near where he grew up in Mansfield, Ohio. A farmer at heart, he became one of Americas most influential and revered conservationists after he founded Malabar Farm near Mansfield. After his death, the farm and the &quot;Big House&quot;  a marvelous home if ever there was one  were purchased by the state of Ohio and remain one of the states most popular tourist attractions.<br /> Mr. Bromfield was hardly the stereotype of a farmer. While he loved to get his boots as muddy as any sodbuster, he also maintained the grand social lifestyle that he and his wife Mary had cultivated in France. The &quot;Big House&quot; was constantly filled with thirty or more guests. At any one time, it would host movie stars such as Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall (who were married at the house), New York Socialites, writers as E.B. White and Inez Robb, farmers from overseas, and of course the children and a platoon of slobbering Boxers.<br /> Mr. Bromfield loved to be surrounded by compelling and conversational people almost as much as he enjoyed being surrounded by the lush and bountiful fields of Malabar Farm. Both fed him.<br /> It was a life was well lived, and his loving daughter does a fine job of capturing the mystique, the paradox and, yes, the weaknesses of her larger than life dad.<br />Louis who?<br /> If you dont know, youll be better for finding out through this eloquent, entertaining and insightful memoir by  Mrs. Geld.	2001-08-09

They aren't closely focused on the physical and emotional plight of the soldier, as were the columns of Ernie Pyle.   <br />Instead, they capture the auras and subtleties of both big and little events. &quot;What it's like&quot; is the best description of these slices of war life, nobody puts you there better, nobody captures the mood of a place more vividly. <br />What it's like to be one of thousands of soldiers stretch across the deck or house in the bowels of a troop carrier, destination unknown? What's it like to sit through an air raid during the blitz? <br />Or, a few columns take a lighter approach. In one, he salutes the incredible durability and dedication of Bob Hope and his USO shows. Another details the American soldier's skill in growing vegetable gardens. Another muses about the popularity of the German song &quot;Lillie Marlene&quot; among both Nazi and Allied troops.<br />And some columns delve into deeper territory, such as his theory as to why so few men who have been in battle talk about it. <br />Steinbeck did not spend a great deal of time as a war correspondent.

There isn&#8217;t much of it, and he has a [six thousand dollar] monthly payment coming due at the local bank. <br />And then things get really complicated. <br />An elderly, dying man shows up at The Bullet&#8217;s office, and asks Jefferson Morgan to write his story.<br />Fifty years ago, the man pleaded guilty to the brutal murder of a seven-year-old girl. Now, just released from prison, he claims he didn&#8217;t do it. And he wants the new editor/publisher to prove that he didn&#8217;t do it. <br />At first, Morgan is more than a little skeptical. But he feels obligated to check it out. And there isn&#8217;t much time because the cancer-ridden old man may only have a few days to live. <br />What Morgan uncovers creates tremors in the community that threaten the existence of his newspaper. <br />Does he risk all by digging through a small town&#8217;s dark closets and exposing a killer who has been undetected for over 50 years? Or does he keep the information to himself to save his newspaper? <br />\\"THE DEADLINE \\" is what you would expect from the prose of the talented Ron Franscell, who is among the finest fiction writers to evolve from the newsroom of a community newspaper in this decade. <br />Franscell has switched genres on us, but he&#8217;s done it in style, more specifically his unique style of painting-in-words a depth of emotion that morphs with the setting and characters. And no writer has done or does a better jobof depicting the aura of working at a hometown newspaper.  <br /> <br />But, back to the about-face in genres. Franscell&#8217;s first book \\"Angel Fire,\\" released in 1998, is a rich, marvelous work of literary fiction that was named #74 of the San Francisco Chronicle&#8217;s Top 100 Western Fiction Books of the 20th Century.  The story of two brothers from a small town in Wyoming who are raised by a widowed newspaper publisher is close to a masterpiece. <br />\\"THE DEADLINE\\" is no \\"Angel Fire.\\"  Franscell decided to follow a different muse. <br />His premise and structure is typical for a suspense novel &#8211; get a man up a tree, throw rocks at him, get him back down. Franscell throws a quarry of rocks at his protagonist, Morgan, as the man struggles with his conscience and convictions. And there are the usual plot twists, turns and surprises that keep the reader flipping pages. <br />What separates Franscell from the rest of a very large pack of mystery writers is the sheer quality of his writing. There are many mystery writers who get the man up the tree and keep us turning pages to see if he&#8217;ll ever get back down. <br />But when you add writing that flows smooth and runs deep, like a proud old river, you have something different, a mystery novel that transcends and separates itself from all the others.	2001-07-18

First Sergeant Martin Winch is a cynical, but superb leader who struggles with congestive heart failure while trying his best to protect the other three men. Mess Sgt. Johnny Strange is the nurturer who looks after the others while he struggles with the infidelity of his wife, and the injustices of the Army pecking order. Buck Sergeant Marion Landers tries but fails to handle the monstrous fury that wells up inside him. Corporal Bobby Prell fights to save his legs from amputation and copes with feelings of guilt over a Congressional Medal of Honor that he does not believe he deserves. <br /> This was Jones&#8217; final book, and he was unable to finish the final three chapters before he died of congestive heart failure (his death is portrayed in the movie \\"A Soldier&#8217;s Daughter Never Cries\\" based on the book written by his daughter, Kaylie.)<br /> Unfortunately, the last book of the trilogy doesn&#8217;t measure up to the first two, and it pains me to write this because I am one of Jones&#8217; major fans. The story, the writing, Jones&#8217; unique ability to get into the head of the GI just aren&#8217;t as sharp in this work. <br /> There is also the matter of his preoccupation about a man performing oral ... on a woman&#8211; he goes on and on and on about it throughout the book. The ... is graphic, even by today&#8217;s standards. All well and good, but the preoccupation with oral ... stretched and exceeded the limits of its role in the story line. It&#8217;s like Jones&#8217; had a statement to make, and he made it too often; and he made it too important for credibility. <br />   And then there is the end of the book, which should have been handled differently. Jones was unable to complete the final three and one half chapters, but he let his intentions for the finale be known in detail. A friend and neighbor, Willie Morris, wrote the last chapters from notes and recordings. They are not written as fiction, but as a summary of what the author intended to happen. The novel would have been much better had a skilled writer done the end as a continuing fictional narrative, imitating Jones&#8217; style.

There's an endless barrage of short Asian and long French names to get through and forget. While historical perspective is needed, this section should have been structured in a better narrative, and condensed. <br />From the Kennedy years on, however, the book is a page turner, a fascinating account of how America's so-called &quot;best and brightest&quot; government officials and awesome military power were no match for an enemy whose persistence, patience and capacity for suffering knew no bounds. <br />It wasn't that America wasn't warned. In the 1940s, Ho Chi Minh, the revered communist leader and nationalist, told the French: &quot;You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours, but even at those odds, you will lose and I will win.&quot;<br />How right he was in regard to America's involvement later: 60,000 American dead - 600,000 Vietnamese dead - victory for the communists.<br />The scar of Vietnam seems to be branded on the American conscience. <br />At least relatively objective accounts (and Vietnam/A History thus qualifies) of the web we wove and suffocated in will, perhaps, offer a lesson for future generations. <br />Perhaps.	2001-07-16

But Angel Fire came as close as any to date. Ron not only opened a vein to write this book, he opened up the depths of his heart to create a wonderful tale that weaves love for family, the magical moments of growing up in small town America in the 1950s, and the tragedy of war into a excellent plot.     <br />The story centers on Cassidy McLeod, a disenchanted writer and journalist from San Francisco whose father had been an editor and publisher of a small town newspaper in Wyoming. Cassidy's life is shaken when his revered older brother, Daniel, a war correspondent presumed killed in the Vietnam War, shows up in his Wyoming hometown in 1995. Cassidy puts his life on hold to care for Daniel, who is all but catatonic from horrific war experiences.<br />The particular strength of the novel is in its flashbacks. Usually, flashbacks are considered a fiction taboo, especially for an inexperienced novelist. The theory is that all they tend to do is slow down the plot.<br />That's anything but the case in Angel Fire. The flashback chapters and scenes are compelling, unforgettable stories in themselves that establish the powerful emotional bond Cassidy has for his brother. When that bond collides with the tragic circumstances of 1995, it creates the stuff of which unforgettable stories are made.<br />The flashback scenes represent writing and storytelling at its finest, capturing the innocence of the post-war 1950s, the essence of hometown newspapering and the aura of growing up in a small town as well as any novel I've read. <br /> Ron's style flows as smooth as an AP wire story, and he has an excellent instinct for compelling detail and vivid description, both executed without slowing down the story. <br />Many literary writers complain that their work is ignored in favor of the Tom Clancys, John Grishams and Danielle Steels of the writing world. But in many cases literary writers create beautiful prose and then forget the most critical element of any work of fiction, whether it's literary, a romance, a thriller or a mystery.<br />  They forget to tell a good story.<br />Ron Franscell doesn't forget to tell us a good story. In Angel Fire, he tells an excellent story that elevates and embraces the humanity in all of us.	2001-07-09

The Fudds all fire their double-barreled shotguns at the same time. Some of the pellets fly over your head, some give you a pain in the butt, some hit smack in the middle of your funny bone. <br /> Such is the case with &quot;Brain Droppings&quot;, a couple thousand pellets of Carlinisms spread out over 258 pages.<br /> The layout of the book is as wacky and disjointed as Carlin's comedy - all kinds of fonts, weird leading, bold headings and dingbats. It fits. <br /> You'll shake your head, roll your eyes and yawn at some of the material. George loves to play with words, and he uses a lot of them in this book to go on and on and on - too much, already - about their use. For instance, redundancies: &quot;honest truth&quot;, or euphemisms like &quot;gambling joint = gaming resort&quot;, or oxymorons as &quot;open secret.&quot; <br /> There are longer sections, for instance a repeat of his classic comparison of baseball and football . . . <br />&quot;In football the object is for the quarterback, otherwise known as the field general, to be on target with his aerial assault, riddling the defense by hitting his receivers with deadly accuracy in spite of the blitz, even if he has to use the shotgun.<br /> &quot;In baseball the object is to go home. And to be safe! I hope I'll be safe at home!&quot;<br />And, of course, George must be George and the book is full of foul language and terse tidbits guaranteed to offend all groups and subgroups. For example, &quot;How do they get all of those Down's syndrome kids to look the same?&quot;<br />And that's a milder example. <br />So if you're a fuddy-duddy stay away. But if you don't mind a potty-mouthed Elmer Fudd, a good time is guaranteed.	2001-07-03

Mr. Steinbeck's letters and journals blaze with sharp and honest introspection, keen insight into human behavior and empathy. It's certain that an autobiography would have been a classic.  <br />So, instead, we rely on those who write biographies to chronicle the life of one of America's great writers. <br />There have been several Steinbeck biographies and many of those have been well done. But Jackson J. Benson's version, titled simply &quot;John Steinbeck, Writer&quot;, is the definitive one - over 1,000 pages of readable and compelling material that follows the writer's life from his Huck Finn childhood in Salinas, California, to the success of his novels and the failures of his marriages in midlife, and finally to domestic bliss mixed with pain from pretentious critics whose stones and arrows he could not duck and would not ignore in his later years.<br />The ability to wrestle the massive amount of research that this work involved into a book that anyone can enjoy is an achievement that amazes. <br />It's the next best thing to the autobiography that never was.	2001-05-29

There, in a cauldron of ruin, mayhem and death, the Russian Army defeated the German Army and turned the tide of World War Two.   <br />In the midst of this battle that claimed over one million lives, there is the true story of two master snipers - Russian Chief Master Sergeant Vasily Zaitzev and German SS Colonel Heinz Thorvald - who are assigned to seek out and kill the other.   <br />Author David L.

The result is compelling story that moves fast, fascinates, and skillfully blends fact with fiction.   <br />Mr. Robbins distinguishes himself as a storyteller.

Lash, and a doctor she met on a trip to Switzerland, Dr. David Gurewitsch.   <br />The letters reveal her devotion to her children, who were a source of frequent disappointment and frustration. They also are a testament to her unbelievable energy. Mrs. Roosevelt's travel schedule, even in her final years, would be a challenge to the youngest and heartiest of globetrotters.   <br />The book does have weaknesses. The author seems to make the assumption that the reader is either familiar with his earlier books about the Roosevelts, or has some other source of knowledge about Mrs. Roosevelt's relationships to the persons to whom she writes in A World of Love.   <br />More background information about the recipients of the letters is needed throughout, and this is particularly true in the case of Mrs. Roosevelt's relationship to Mr. Lash and his wife, Trude. Also, the two should be included in the picture sections of the book. Perhaps the fact that they are not is a sign of the author's modesty but, nevertheless, it is a definite oversight.   <br />A World of Love is a worthwhile read for any admirer of one of history's most dynamic and selfless women. But this book could have been a world better if the narrative had included more information about the people who were fortunate enough to attract Eleanor Roosevelt's attention and affection.	2001-05-27

(And who could blame him?)<br /> James Bradley largely avoids that pitfall, however, in &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot;, a wonderfully researched and well told account of the lives of the six Marines pictured in one of the most famous photographs - probably THE most famous - in American history.      Mr. Bradley chronicles the lives of all six men from their childhood through the flag raising, and  (for the three who survived Iwo) then the aftermath of the famous photo. Little did they know that a battlefield errand would result in an image that Michaelangelo would be hard put to duplicate.<br />   The stories of Ira Hayes, Franklin Sousely, John Bradley, Harlon Block, Mike Strank and Rene Gagnon are fascinating but perhaps no more compelling than those of six other Marines selected at random on Iwo that day. <br />   And maybe that's the point. These men were made famous by a fluke of timing, but the diversity of their stories, their personalities, their individual acts of bravery meld together to honor all the brave men on or below Mt. Suribachi that day.<br /> In spirit, thousands of hands raised the Flag. Some lived, some died, but they are all well and honorably represented by the men who will forever live in that famous photograph.	2001-02-19

West, the former Chief Usher at The White House, gives us an insider's view of America's most famous mansion. But this is hardly a boring house tour. Mr. West - in a dignified but very readable account - focuses on the Presidents, First Ladies, and their children, all who made this house on Pennsylvania Avenue a home.    With great empathy and appreciation, he recalls the experience of working for Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, Harry and Bess Truman, Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower, John and Jacqueline Kennedy, and Lyndon and Lady Bird Johnson. <br /> Each family had their own style that the White House staff had to adjust to, from the reserved Roosevelts, to the refined young Kennedys, to the big-as-Texas style of Lyndon Baines Johnson which was in contrast with Lady Bird, his considerate and composed wife. <br /> His portrayals of the First Families are not condescending, yet they are still very respectful. In his position, Mr. West worked closely with the First Ladies and each one had personal qualities that he grew to admire. <br /> The accounts of ceremonies, dinners and banquets, remodelings, sudden changes, and visits by various dignitaries are all compelling reading in themselves. But we get an even more significant historical viewpoint through the description of the events that took place in The White House during crises, such as FDR's death, the attempted shooting of Truman, the Kennedy assasination, LBJ's announcement that he would not seek another term. <br /> Surely, there were frustrations, and many of them are recorded in the book while others were avoided. For instance, I'm sure that Mr. West knew about some of JFK's White House trysts but chose not to write about them. If he would have, the book would have been even more successful than it was. <br /> But Mr. West takes the high road, and we get to enjoy the view with him.<br /> Well done, Mr. Chief Usher.	2001-02-19

The other is Erich Maria Remarque, author of the novel &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front,&quot; where the setting is the trench warfare of World War One.<br /> &quot;All Quiet&quot; was a pacesetter, a bold and honest account of the uncounted horrors of the battlefield as experienced by a young man. Written in a simple but poetic way, it follows the soldier from training camp, to the terror of the battlefield, to the hospital, and to home on leave among civilians. It's a journey of a universal soldier who inevitably loses his comrades, his sense of self, and any semblance of youthful innocence to the vulgarity of war.<br /> &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; deserves its status of a classic.  Again, I also suggest &quot;The Forgotten Soldier&quot; by Guy Sajer, which is even more vivid and touching. And, another outstanding novel of war by an American writer: &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; by James Jones.	2001-02-17

There are not many of us would be willing to spend a year as a corrections officer in one of the toughest prisons of the country, the infamous Sing Sing, for the sake of a book.   Ted Conover did just that and the result is a book that is both relevant and needed, because there is too little written from the vantage point of the CO - the  man or woman who goes to work everyday in one of the most drab and dangerous environments possible.  (Although Mr. Conover has received his share of criticism from other CO's for writing the book, overall it casts the profession in a positive light. It's impossible for any reader to not come away with some degree of empathy and respect for those guarding our prisons.) Within those old, decaying walls of Sing Sing, and other prisons like it, there is a climate of fear and a delicate balance between control and potential chaos. Mr. Conover captures that world in detail in &quot;Newjack.&quot; It's a fine piece of journalism.	2001-02-15

You can come to it because you want a girl to marry you or because you want to change the world. Come to it any way but lightly. Let me say it again: you must not come lightly to the blank page ... This isn't a popularity contest, it's not the moral Olympics, and it's not church. But it's writing damn it, not washing the car or putting on eyeliner. If you can't take it seriously, we can do business. If you can't or won't, it's time to close the book and do something else.   &quot;Wash the car maybe.&quot; <br />   This quote pretty much sets the tone for Stephen King's &quot;On Writing,&quot; a very candid and very entertaining book on the art and craft of writing fiction.<br />   And who better to write this book than a superb and prolific writer who has sold about a kazillion copies of his works. <br /> &quot;On Writing&quot; is a different type of &quot;how to&quot; book because it has heart and substance. It's written in King's unique - sometimes hilarious, sometimes gritty - voice, a voice that offers sound, no b-s advice. As a bonus, King offers some autobiographical insight into his career, which has been influenced by incidents ranging from his childhood babysitter sitting on his face to the recent, horrendous accident that almost claimed his life.<br /> This is the first book that Mr. King struggled to write after the accident.

It's a fine specimen of lousy research, poor editing and using the name of an enigmatic, legendary figure to sell a book. <br /> It reads like the author contacted some of Hogan's acquaintances and asked them to phone in or drop a note with one or two memories of The Hawk. Then he copies them down and publishes them, verbatim.<br /> Most of these recollections are about as dry as a sand trap in the Sahara. For instance, one of the recollections is from the waiter who served Mr. Hogan at Shady Oaks. His memory: &quot;I waited on him almost every day. He would order a cup of bean soup, toast, bacon, stuff like that, He would eat scrambled eggs and bacon.&quot; <br /> The book is full of these dry-as-toast tidbits.  It's a wonder it doesn't cover how Mr. Hogan went to the bathroom. But, wait a minute, it does!

Although she wrote other novels, her work after &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; never came close to capturing the characterizations and sense of time and place exhibited in this fine, even extraordinary, piece of writing that was released in 1943. <br /> But so what? Who needs an encore when the first performance has readers standing in the aisles?  &quot;A Tree Grows In Brooklyn&quot; is as readable today as it was fifty years ago. It has stood the test of time to become one of America's most beloved and enduring novels. <br />   The story evolved from Ms. Smith's experiences growing up in Brooklyn in the very early 1900s. Although it is a novel, it's obvious that the core experiences are autobiographical. The main character in the book, Francie Nolan, is Betty Smith.<br /> The book carries us through a little more than ten years of life with the poor but proud Nolan family. The Nolans face numerous hardships - the heartbreak of losing a warm-hearted but alcoholic father, the attempted rape of Francie, the shame of being poor - but they are held together by the steely determination of Francie's mother, Katie.<br /> There are unique characters, perhaps the most unforgettable is the promiscuous and colorful Aunt Sissy who worked in a condom factory, had the habit of marrying time and time again without getting a divorce, and had ten babies stillborn, until a fake pregnancy brings her first healthy child (how? I won't give that away.)<br /> But the book's strongest point is its ability to capture a place and a time: Brooklyn in turn-of-the-century America. Not since Charles Dickens has a writer so skillfully described an era and a physical setting. Betty Smith harpooned with a pen the details and nuances that made Brooklyn the true melting pot of America, a rugged and confused place that bore more genius than anywhere else in the world.    Ms. Smith is gone. Her tree is still growing.	2001-01-05

It's almost as if it's a vehicle to take you back into a better time, a grander time. <br /> Such is the case with &quot;Our Finest Hour&quot;, a collection of black and white photographs from the pages of Life Magazine. All the photos were taken during what was likely America's grandest, most noble, time of all, World War Two. <br /> Some of the master photographers are represented in this book, including Alfred Eisenstaedt and W. Eugene Smith. The images are extraordinary. Examples include a photo by Eisenstaedt of a sailor on furlough, chatting with two grizzled elderly men - all three sitting on a cannon in a city park; and classic pictures of the hell of combat on the barren, smoldering landscape of Iwo Jima taken by W. Eugene Smith. <br /> The quality is no surprise. If it's from Life Magazine, you expect the best, and the tradition continues. The book is well organized with helpful text and narrative, beginning with Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor and ending with soldiers coming home to their families, friends, lovers and a grateful country in 1945.

Admiral Byrd planned to set up an &quot;Advance Base&quot; (a weather station in the inland area of Antarctica) that was separated from the rest of his exploration team at Little America by 123 miles. For six months of the Antarctic winter, there would be no way for a rescue team to reach Advance Base. <br />Almost unbelievably, he decides to man the weather station by himself. The plan had been for three men to operate Advance Base, but he opts to go it alone because some supplies were lost and - the real reason - he wants the spiritual experience of being by himself.  <br />Not a smart idea. Unless you're a bear with a whole lot of white fur, sitting on your duff during a bitter winter at the South Pole is not Club Med, South. As the fantastically frigid, dark and brutal winter sets in, Byrd discovers that it really is cold outside, and inside as well thanks to a faulty furnace that leaks carbon monoxide. <br />He blames the latter for the deterioration of his mental facilities and becomes all but immobilized by what appears to be, in today's psychobabble, severe clinical depression.<br />The resulting tale of mind over a continent of murderously icy, windy matter is eloquent and well-told. Admiral Byrd's courage and perseverance is inspiring. But his judgment, which got him into this polar predicament in the first place, is less than zero.	2000-12-28

Then, in five unique narratives, not necessarily via their point of view, it twists and weaves through that terrific and terrible decade of the 60s.<br />   By far the most unforgettable section is the title piece. Here, King switches to the first person viewpoint to cover the chaotic college years of the 60s. It's hilarity with heart, and the narrative voice is reminiscent of J.D. Salinger's &quot;Catcher in the Rye.&quot;<br /> My only criticism is the end. It's a little complex and a lot sappy.<br />   But the bottom line is that &quot;Hearts. . .&quot;  is a tremendous tale for baby boomers - even horror-baby boomers like myself - that is VERY well told. I'm sold. Steve will make $65,000,000 next year.	2000-12-02

They're almost always saved for James Jones, author of &quot;From Here to Eternity,&quot; &quot;The Thin Red Line&quot; and &quot;Whistle.&quot;<br /> But Mr. Robbins' &quot;The End of War&quot; is a remarkable novel. It's not literary, it's just a helluva good story, very well told. It moves at a lightning pace. It beautifully intertwines history with the stories of three very different people, an American war photographer, a Russian soldier, and a teenage girl trapped in Berlin. <br /> For historical perspective, Mr. Robbins uses the perspectives of Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin to chronicle the rush to Berlin during the last five months of the war. <br /> These World Leader chapters are informative and entertaining. But they serve to provide only a framework for the personal sagas of the photographer, the Russian and the girl. <br /> Surprisingly, perhaps - because Mr. Robbins is an American and a scholar of history - the two stories that pack an unforgettable punch are of Ilya, the battered soldier and Lottie, the helpless German girl. <br /> Particularly, the latter. The terror and hopelessness depicted in the Berlin narrative is some of the best writing of war ever penned. And the ending is perfect. That's all I can say - Absolutely and Artistically Perfect. <br /> I hope Hollywood discovers this book. It's a classic mini-series waiting to happen.	2000-12-01

Their experiences speak for themselves. The over-patriotic and sappy text that introduces each of their letters just gets in the way. <br />I have no doubt about Mr. Brokaw's good intentions. And I don't want in any way want to show disrespect toward the courageous men and women who are the subjects of these two books. <br />But bad writing is bad writing, and this applies to the 20 percent of the book that Mr. Brokaw and his assistants produced. The subjects deserve simple respect, not a gusher of uninhibited, flag-waving adulation. <br />If you are interested in reading more compelling, honest and well-written first hand accounts of this era, I suggest &quot;The Good War&quot; by Studs Terkel.	2000-12-01

It has to be sipped, like expensive wine, to be appreciated for its lush use of language, crisp and witty dialogue and, most of all, the depth of the characterizations. The story is about Francis Phelan, a drunk and a hobo whose life has hit bottom. In 1938, for some reason that even he doesn't know, he returns to his hometown of Albany to face the people he loved and left behind, and the ghosts of his past. This is a memorable journey into a failed man's soul. If you appreciate fine writing and unforgettable characters, you will will savor this fine work of literature.	2000-10-24
US	51007830	ROSDAVLMLWAYE	0375502025	190088526	The Greatest Generation	Books	2	79	113	N	N	Well meant, not well written	As a World War Two buff, I was looking forward to this book. A strong case can be made that the men and women who grew up during the Depression and fought or helped with the war effort during World War 11 are The Greatest Generation in American History.  The same point could be made for the European, Russian and Asian young adults of that era who not only fought in the war, but had to suffer the unimaginable horrors of invasion and occupation.    So, the premise of the book is a good idea and I have no doubt about Tom Brokaw's sincerity in writing it (with the help of a team of researchers.) Good intentions don't yield good research, good thinking and good writing, however. The book lacks substance, and depth. Be prepared to wade through chapter after chapter of Readers Digest-like writing that gushes with sappy salutes and honey-dipped hyperbole.  This isn't meant to at all demean the courage or accomplishments of the men and women who are the subjects of &quot;The Greatest Generation.&quot; It's just that the book would have been much better had more effort been put into the depth and detail of their stories, and less effort into Flag-waving rhetoric.	2000-10-22

Not one? <br />Well John Glenn did it, which has to be another first for the United States' most celebrated spaceman.<br />Yea, he does moan just a little about minor irritations like dirty politics, or the fact that we didn't use all of our military power to kick some North Vietnamese butt in the late 60s. But you have a better chance finding a pink elephant orbiting the earth than you will finding a shred of criticism about anyone in John Glenn: A Memoir.<br />It's totally fitting for a man who has led a life that captures the all the images of Mom, apple pie and the Stars and Stripes. A boy is born in idyllic American town, New Concord, Ohio. He meets the love of his life, Annie, in the playpen. He goes off to fight the Good War as a fighter pilot. Then, he's a jet fighter pilot in the Korean War, dodging flak, shooting down Migs and earning five or six Distinguished Flying Crosses along the way. Then, he's selected as one of the first astronauts, and he becomes the first American to orbit the earth. He becomes an American hero, and his best chums are from the Kennedy clan. He serves as a United States Senator, and flies into space again at the age of seventy-seven. <br />Jee-zow--e-e-e! I'm not worthy! I'm not worthy!<br />But I would be petty and envious to deny that this fine man has led a wonderful life. John Glenn's adventures are well told (in partnership with Nick Taylor) in this All-American autobiography.	2000-09-29

This well-written account of his battle with testicular cancer that  had spread to his lungs and brain is noteworthy not only as a &quot;I beat  cancer&quot; story, but as a straight-shooting portrayal of a rather  arrogant young man who faced the very real possibility of death, survived,  and became a better human being. <br />Mr. Armstrong certainly doesn't try to  canonize himself, and that's what's refreshing about It's Not About the  Bike. He's completely up front about his weaknesses such as a nasty temper,  impatience, and tendency to be brash. There are interesting and honest  accounts of his bitterness toward his real father and stepfather, and the  complete devotion of his mother. And while, like most Americans, you may  not be a bicycle racing fan, the story of how he regrouped and eventually  won the sport's crown jewel - The Tour de France - is exciting and  inspiring. <br />Mr. Armstrong has the wisdom to know that his victory over  cancer had as much to do with the Gods of good fortune as it did his own  determination and fortitude. He says, &quot;Some of it is not easy to tell  or comfortable to hear. I'm asking you now, at the outset, to put aside  your ideas about heroes and miracles, because I'm not storybook material.  This is not Disneyland, or Hollywood . . . Good, strong people get cancer,  and they do all the right things to beat it, and they still die. That is  the essential truth that you learn. People die. And after you learn it, all  other things seem irrelevant. They just seem small.&quot; <br />There is also  a relevant section about the difficult process of in-vitro fertilization  that his wife, Kik, went through. (Mr. Armstrong became sterile after his  cancer surgery and treatments.) Happily, the procedure was a success that  culminated with the birth of a healthy son, Luke David Armstrong. The  candid and sometimes graphic description of IVF is of valueto any couple  who would like to consider this option. <br />Kudos also go to Sally Jenkins,  the co-writer who did a beautiful job of organizing the book and capturing  Mr. Armstrong's voice and personality.	2000-09-10

There is beautiful description, incredibly  realistic dialogue, and a compelling story that captures the heart and  seeks out the very core of one's conscious.  And the beauty of it is that  it's thoroughly understandable. The eloquent writing and flawless story can  be savored by anyone from a junior high school student to a PhD.<br />The  book is also innovative, intertwining short chapters that capture the  plight of the dispossessed with longer chapters that follow the long road  traveled by the Joad family to California. This is accomplished without at  all disrupting the flow of the story.<br />No wonder that this book won the  Pulitzer Prize and was the key work cited for Mr. Steinbeck's Nobel Prize.<br />It's a mighty piece of literature.	2000-09-05

While only a few  will walk on the moon's surface, or see the glowing blue marble of earth  from 200,000 miles away, these pictures make for an artifact that comes as  close as anything can of capturing the grandeur and mystery of the lunar  surface.<br />Many of the photos are so detailed and incredible that they  can be classified in many categories: as science, as history, as art. In  any case, we're so fortunate to live in a time when we are able to see  close up - in glorious detail - our celestial neighbor. And it turns out to  be a rugged, rough and starkly beautiful object that is even beyond the  past imaginings of philosophers, pioneers, poets and peasants.<br />Full Moon  isn't just a book.

If you're a &quot;serious writer&quot; - the type who sits down at the  keyboard and opens up a vein, as Red Smith would say - you need I'd Rather  Be Writing. <br /> You need this book because you're probably taking  yourself too seriously, as writers tend to do. Marcia Golub offers balm for  your wounded soul via sound advice and a fantastic sense of humor.<br />  The mixture makes for a book that's helpful, and often hilarious.<br />  While the style may be breezy, there's plenty of meat. I found the sections  on writer's block, meeting a rigid self-imposed deadline, and &quot;writing  through&quot; very helpful. True, it's advice that you've probably heard or  read before. But Marcia presents ideas and exercises that are fresh and  genuinely useful. <br /> For instance, here's one of her more serious  passages about making progress:<br /> &quot;Some people tell themselves  they can't write without a perfect beginning. They're looking for that  opening sentence, that great scene, the bit that's going to bring the whole  together. And so they can't start. But they can't get that beginning  without actually beginning. No amount of kvetching and moaning and pushing  is going to get it out of them. The only chance one has of finding that  beginning is beginning. This sounds like a koan, some kind of irritating  wisdom along the lines of the sound of one hand clapping. I don't mean to  annoy you. There's no other way to say it. You start by starting. You give  up perfectionism. What has perfectionism done for you lately? It's kept you  frozen in the dread of that first step. Instead of giving into that feeling  you say: okay this isn't how I want it to go, but it's a start. Then you  tap out an inane sentence or two or two hundred . . . eventually it will  start to flow . . . by the time you get to the end you will know or at  least have a better idea how to begin.&quot; <br /> I would venture to say  that this is Ms. Golub's best selling book. By her own admission, her  novels have not fared well. Maybe she should adapt the muse she followed in  the writing of this book to her fiction. If she put this voice and wit into  a novel, there's plenty of potential.	2000-08-23

In my opinion, the greatest American writer is John Steinbeck, and the  great American novel is The Grapes of Wrath. So it was a delight to read  this fluid, exhaustively researched and insightful biography of Steinbeck  by Jay Parini. <br /> From Steinbeck's birth in northern California in  1902, to his death in 1968, the book details the influences and defining  moments in Steinbeck's life.  There is very little conjecture here. The  book is objective, but the details are compelling and the writing is  smooth. The complete cooperation of Steinbeck's third wife, Elaine, was, I  think, a key the book's veracity as well as its insight. <br /> You'll be  inspired by the young Steinbeck's complete faith in his writing ability. He  sensed his destiny at a young age, and stubbornly pursued it.  <br />  You'll be surprised at how a man with such a deep inner sense of his own  gift for writing was, at the same time, so easily devastated by critics.  <br /> You'll be amazed at Steinbeck's popularity and influence around the  world. The world recognized Steinbeck's genius, while the literary pecking  order in the United States threw stones. Why? - probably for two reasons.  First, we love to throw stones at those who achieve popular and financial  success. It's an American tradition. Second, woe be to the author whose  writing can be understood by the masses. Steinbeck was an eloquent writer  whose beautiful prose could be savored by everyone, and he wrote a superb  story on top of it. The literary elitists prefer writing and a story that  can only be understood by literary elitists. <br /> I have only one mild  criticism of Mr. Parini's biography of Steinbeck. As I said, there is  little conjecture, but he does seem to put a load of psychobabble guilt in  the laps of Steinbeck's mother and father. The evidence seems to indicate  otherwise. His mother's perfectionism wasn't all bad, and wouldn't any  mother be concerned if her 30-year-old son was still living as a  near-pauper? And his father may have been a passive man, but he supported  his son financially through many, many lean years. The portrayal of John  Ernst Steinbeck as a failure is too harsh a judgment.<br /> But that's  only a minor criticism. This is truly a marvelous biography about the most  talented and compassionate of American writers.	2000-08-22
