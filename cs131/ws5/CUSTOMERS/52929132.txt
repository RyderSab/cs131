I have been reading many real estate books recently and this one is the one that stands out the most. This book is a very good start for beginners who are looking to get into RE investing, either as a full-time job or something to do on the side. This book takes you through most of the detail needed to accomplish these and other tasks: writting an offer letter, tenant management, rent control understanding, etc.  <br />The book also covers area of mortgage negotiations, tips on how to be able to show profits without paying taxes immediately and other tips of the trade. <br />I recommend this book over many others who preach their seminars and other non-RE related topics.	2005-08-22

I read this book to get more information on how to do Tax Lien's in various states. The book itself was very easy to read and the author was able to create a step by step method to invest in tax liens. One think to research is make sure you can do this type of investment in your area. Where I live, Boston, does not have any tax liens. So I need to research and invest in FL. I read 2 other books on this matter and it this book was fine and enough to understand how tax lien's work and the approach to take. <br />Enjoy.	2005-08-10

I enjoyed the first couple of chapters of this book. This book would be a good start for couples that need to talk and settle their finances together. If you have not talked to your partner about your finances and need to start that discussion this is the book is your starting point. The author has a really good method of setting expectations for the future between couples and setting guidelines (9 steps) that can be followed during and after you create a plan. It is very important to at least try the authors method for I think they work. As for the rest of the book it is very similar if not the same information as other beginner investment books: how to set up a retirement plan, savings and checking accounts and all the basic items.  Enjoy the book.	2005-08-10

This book is a quick read with lot's advise on how to think and manage your life to be successful. I would recommend the read in this book if you have not read other motivational or self-help books. The book mainly describes 9 steps to think and grow rich. The term \\"Rich\\" is specific to understand that the reader should be able to grow \\"rich\\" in funds and emotionaly by thinking and doing the 9 steps described in the book. The writter pulls most of this thoughts from key successful individuals (i.e. Edison, Ford, and others),so specifically taking their thoughts, actions and motives into consideration the author has written a motivational book.	2005-08-10

The author described in detail every leaders character, background and decision process during that time period.

I enjoyed reading this book for understanding how humans make subliminal decisions during an on-going decision process. The research showed results of  what some call the 6th sense.  <br />The first three quarters of the book was interesting to read since the author was writting about the \\"blink\\" concept in our minds and actions and backed it with different examples. <br />The one example that I thought was interesting was the commander beating the computer in simulations, although another insight to that was how humans are enhancing computers to start thinking like our \\"blink\\". <br />The last chapters of the book were not interesting since it seemed the author ran out of examples and kept repeating himself, and started writting more about technical data.	2005-04-07

Mr. Moore writes about the issues with the Bush family and the ethics of the US government towards the World before and after 9/11. Most of his points are backed up with research; some points seemed bias especially concerning corporations and the government. I do agree with most of his points although would recommend readers to do their own research beforehand. I thought this book deserved 4-stars, since Mr. Moore kept pushing the same point towards the Bush family and thought he should have expanded more on the other government officials he mentioned in the book.<BR>On a side note, I just saw his movie &quot;Roger &amp; me&quot;, which depicts the Flint city falling apart due to GM leaving the city; this movie also shows how Mr. Moore started his journey. It is good for the American society to see a different point of view from the ones we see on public TV and some newspapers. Looking forward to watch his newest movie &quot;Fahrenheit 911&quot;.

The writer was able to break down all the money making methods (technical analysis, financial analysis, decimal vs. fraction, etc.) of the stock market into bottom line numbers.<BR>The reason that I stated my title &quot;Cannot predict the future by looking into the past&quot;, is because anytime a market analysis theory was placed into a numeral perspective it was concluded as luck and could not be really used as a final conclusion. Which is true because if any one has a conclusive method to predict the future of the stock market should be very rich and should not declare it.<BR>Enjoy the read.	2004-01-15

This was a good reference on the greediness of corporate America and how the political scene benefited from since the past 7 years. The author explained the situations very well with some humor at the end of the chapters with some quizzes and relevant jokes. I would recommend this book to other since it helps open the eye of the reader on the behind the scenes of corporation and government actions. The author is a liberal with some great ideas on how to prevent further corporate disasters, for greedy \\"Fat Cat\\". Her ideas I thought were a little too \\"idealistic\\" since corporate America and the government have been working together for the past several generations. Although with the Internet and technology the public can help with some of the authors ideas. The thought I left with was the fact that as the public we need to demand more from our government and be afraid of the corporations.<br />Have fun reading.	2003-09-16

Books	4	12	15	N	N	Interesting observations.	\\"When Generations Collide\\" is a book that describes the clashes of the four generations with practical solutions. The book is separated into five sections:<BR>Section I: Descriptions of the Generations<BR>The book first describes the four generations (birth years): The Traditionalists (1900-1945), Baby Boomers (1946-1964), Generation Xers (1965-1980) and Millennial (1981-1999). The book also mentions the \\"Cusper\\" generation, whom are born five years into or at the end of a generation. The Cuspers are the bridge builders.<br />Section II: Putting the generations to work<BR>In this section, the authors describe the generations' focus on career. In summary, Traditionalists build a legacy, Baby boomers build a stellar career, Gen X build a portable career and Millennial build parallel careers. The book describes the generation careers with explicit detail including how to reward the generations without offending the \\"generational culture\\". This section is interesting since it gives examples from companies that have built various career paths and reward programs for the four generations. <br />Section III: Hiring generations<BR>In this section, the authors describe in detail how to hire generations. Since the values of the generations are different, company value propositions need to be just as various. These values are established with the help of the specific generations. The proposition should be put into action and modified as time passes. If the values do not represent the various generations then the company would have issues to retain talent.<br />Section IV: Retaining and managing the generations<BR>Once you have hired the individuals the book describes, in great detail, how to manage and retain your talent using different methods of involvement. Retaining the talent needed is not easy. The book describes that it is not only up to your company but companies should learn to use their talent to keep talent. Example, part-time alumni traditionalist are helping Xersunderstand the longer term growth of the firm which in turn the firm will be rewarded by Xers not leaving in 6 months. As the book notes it, job changing for Traditionalist is a stigma, for Boomers is getting behind, for Xers is necessary and for Millennials is a way of life.<br />Section V: What's next?<BR>This section was a six page book conclusion.<br />If you are thinking of issues that we deal with our bosses, parents, co-workers and others take into consideration their generation before taking action.<br />Have fun reading.	2003-02-09

This happiness comes from being your own boss and being able to do more of the things that make you happy. I found the first couple of chapters interesting although Mr. Henricks repeated the same benefits and stories of individuals that made their lives better, which in turn made the book repeat itself.<BR>The last third of the book, Mr. Henricks started to focus on the financial topics. He started to analyze balance sheets and answer questions like \\"what is revenue?\\", I then found that this book lost its goal and audience; The goal being emotionally focused on your own business would help you succeed. The audience seemed, at first, to be for individuals who have gone through the initial phases of starting a business and needed a reminder why they started. The financial analysis of a business lost that objective and made this book into a beginner guide to business with a fluff beginning.	2002-12-13

I found that he seemed very negative about the US and was not able to pull out of his negative opinion. In his last chapter he pointed out all the negative items that has happened in the past 3 decades. He might have considered motivating the reader not through disgust from the corporate American syndrome but by showing the positive activities that made a difference.<BR><BR>I would read and recommend Mr. Moore since I like his point of view and his sarcasm.

It gives enough background for all readers to get a fell of management as well as historical knowledge to remind manager why they are managers. The introduction to the book was to the point and attractive enough to purchase the book. Actually her note that the greatest management leaders were the ones to stop the momentum of managers was a chuckle. <BR><BR>The author broke this book into two parts: (1) Design and (2) Execution. <BR>The first part (Design), broken into 4 chapters described value creation, business models, strategy and organization. Each chapter describes how design works tactically, then when thought about can be understood how they integrate together. This part focuses on how to set-up your organization which then properly gets into the second part of execution, where the wheels meet the road.<BR><BR>The second part (Execution), broken into 5 chapters writes about how you can measure and manage the success of your organization. Examples are concrete for most industries. Although I found the end of the book rushed and not as focused as the previous part.<BR><BR>I found the style of the book to be easy to read and understand the concepts for management and non-management readers. At the end of each chapter were examples from profit and non-profit organizations of the chapter concepts, which enables the reader to understand the ideas being used in various environments.<BR>Have fun understanding how management can be so easy.	2002-08-23

The book Fish is comparing a fun play-full fish market, Pike Place Fish Market, to a boring and un-motivated customer service department of a bank, called The Toxic Waste. <BR><BR> The nuggets of the book are:<BR> 1. Choose your attitude - When doing any job chose your attitude: boring vs. fun; can't do vs. can do.<BR> 2. Make their day - Make the day of the people around you; co-workers, clients, etc.<BR> 3. Play - Have fun while you work.<BR> 4. Be Present - be fully present at your job/life.<BR><BR> I found the benefit of the book came towards the end when the department within the bank started to use the advice above in a working environment. It was interesting to see that the advice can be use individually as well as within a group environment. The book is an easy read and fast (1 hour) read. I would recommend the book to readers who are looking for a quick way to get themselves and /or their surroundings into a more motivated mood. <BR> I gave the book three stars because the advice is generic which can be found in other motivational books. <BR><BR> Have fun reading!	2001-08-13

His first section talks about &quot;The Problem&quot;: global thinking, the legal threats to assets and privacy, banking and the Federal Reserve. It was interesting to read about how our information and assets are open to the public and government. Mr. Neal wanted to describe how this open information is a threat to our assets, funds, privacy and well-being. <BR> His second section talks about &quot;Decisive information&quot;: writes mainly about offshore trends, answers to frequently asked questions, fraudulent transfers and the ultimate question of who should go offshore. <BR> His third section explains the various strategies of offshore banking: privacy, dealing with your offshore bank, etc. On chapter 16 it has a directory of offshore banks. Included with the names of the various offshore banks are brief descriptions of their locations, advantages, disadvantages and information about opening an account. <BR> I gave this book a three star rating because I found the books content to be very descriptive on the issues within the United States (governments, privacy, taxation, fund accumulation, etc.) and not enough information on how to take action and implement. <BR> Have fun reading!	2001-02-20

John Murphy is able to explain technical analysis with illustrations.  Technical analysis should be part of the decision-making process when investing for any fund, stock and/or options. This book is able to take you step by step on how to start and continue into the more complex versions of technical analysis. <BR><BR> Mr. Murphy starts in his first section with the basics: Trends, peaks, through, Fibonacci ratio, etc. These explanations are done with illustrations from actual stocks, not from made-up graphs.  <BR><BR> His second section explains indicators: Chapters cover lagging and oscillating moving averages, trading envelopes and bands, measuring overbought and oversold conditions, momentum rate of change (ROC), Relative Strength Index (RSI), stochastic indicators and finally but not least the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator. All the indicators mentioned are explained and demonstrated with real stock graphs. <BR><BR> Mr. Murphy in his final section explains \\"Linkage\\": He starts with the Market Linkages chapter where he sums up his previous book on intermarket technical analysis by explaining how the three major asset classes - commodities, bonds and stocks relate to each other. He explains how as commodity prices rise, which result in higher interest rates and lower bond prices, and vice-versa. He also talks about oil and gold prices and how they can affect the stock market, since they are related to companies directly. The interesting couple of pages I found were the indexes to watch while following the linkages of the market trends. <BR><BR> I most appreciated the summaries at the end of every chapter. <BR><BR> Overall the book is very educational and filled with helpful information to make proper decisions when selecting your next investment(s). One disappointment was the supplied CD. Mr. Murphy kept referring to the supplied software within the CD, although the CD only linked to his site. On his site you can find many (not free) software tools to help in your technical analysis. <BR><BR> Good stepping-stone and reference book for traders and investors. <BR><BR> Have fun.	2001-01-25

If you want to start understanding wine I recommend this book as your first step.<BR> Have fun reading and drinking.	2001-01-02
US	52929132	R2UUPB709H4OL	0786864370	283279775	How to Become CEO: The Rules for Rising to the Top of Any Organization	Books	4	3	3	N	N	Reference for a better path in corporate and individual life	The line under the title states \\"The Rules for Rising to the Top of Any Organization\\", do not take this book as a guide for corporate life, take this book for some life studies as well. Mr. Fox has been able to point out some the fundamental basics of life that our current work intense environment has made us forget. <BR><BR> The method the book is written is in short chapters. Each chapter heading is the thesis and the text is the explanation of the thesis.  The table of content would be the reference and the book would be the explanation.  The book starts with corporate guidelines to achieve the top position: Ch. II Avoid Staff Jobs, Seek Line Jobs, Ch. IV Get and Keep Customers to name a few. Then Mr. Fox gets into individual advice: Ch. V Keep Physically Fit, Ch. XI Don't Smoke. The book goes from corporate to individual and even family advice: Ch. XIX Don't Take Work Home from the Office and Ch. XLIX Please, Be Polite with Everyone.  I will end this review with the excerpts from the introduction of the book: If you are going to buy this book, you are ambitious. Having ambition to better yourself, to be a contributor, to make a difference...is good. <BR><BR>Have fun Reading.	2000-12-28

Elizabeth Castro has been able to demonstrate good examples of web development, or should I say HTML development with visual code examples as well results of the code.  Another trick I licked was how she explained how the different browsers' handled the HTML code.  One thing I did not find very useful was in chapter 4, Creating Images, which the Elizabeth Castro focused too much on a single product and how that can help your web site. In that case then we can list various application/products that can do the same, enhance your web site.  Overall the book is a good reference; it is for beginners and more for the designer then the coder. Have fun coding.	2000-12-15

I bought this book on my Father's request. I started to read it while on the plane to meet him. I was very much indulged to Mr. Ohmae's views, visions and thoughts. The book was well organized and would recommend it to anyone looking to understand how the Internet/technology industry came about, how it is moving forward and where it might be going.   The section that I found most intriguing was in chapter two, section two, called Principles of Platform. In this section Mr. Ohmae talks about the various platforms that have been created within the Invisible Continent. Dell created the platform for people to enter the Invisible Continent by custom made computers. UPS and FedEx have become logistic platforms which thousands of companies and customers gain access to each other. Mr. Ohmae also talks about how platforms can come together through partnership, how platforms contradict each other and how some platforms are yet to be created. Chapter eight summed the book with the four strategies of the new economy; first, mandate for disclosure of the degree of speculation in the financial industry; second, margin speculation should be controlled through international treaty; third, by bundling currency and; fourth a global ombudsman developed for this new  world. I gave this book a four star because I found some predictions were too near future and predictable if you understand the industry. However, The book is a good reference on the key players of the industry, how they conquered and how they need to change to stay alive in this volatile environment. As a management consultant this book is a good guide to the near-future trends (telephone, mobile, internet, broadband, etc.) and how they all fit together within our Global economy and structure.	2000-11-15
US	52929132	RACUWSAV7FVVJ	020530902X	241676942	The Elements of Style, Fourth Edition	Books	5	3	3	N	N	Pure Basics:	Would recommend to anyone that is always worried about witting e-mails, proposals, business documents, even reviews for Amazon.com. English might  be easy to speak at times but writing it is not as simple as I thought.  This little reference book has been a very good guide for the past couple  of weeks. Read it at least once every other month, so that writing basic  documents should not be a problem.	2000-08-14

I refer  to this book when I want to get my team or my clients motivated in  brainstorming sessions.  Dr. Noone had a very clear and humirist fashion of  explaining his basic guidelines of &quot;Problem Solving&quot;:  1.  Mind Maps  2. Option generation  3. Fishhooking and  4.  Analogies to bring out creativity.   From your creative thoughts Dr. Noone  would explain how to be able to utilize those thoughts with various methods  as well how to be able to take action on the solutions. I recommend this  book for a quick and easy read to be prepared for brainstorming sessions as  an individual or as a team.	2000-08-14
