This one - comprehensive, well-researched, and studiously non-alarmist in tone - is probably the likeliest to sway the unconverted. As such, it is the one that the cause most needs. <br /> <br />That said: once you *are* converted, you will believe that more than a little alarmism is called for under the circusmstances. In that respect, \\"The Long Emergency\\" by James Howard Kunstler - which isn't afraid to say flat out how ****ed we are - could be said to tell more of the truth.	2005-09-23

However, I came to see those moments as rhetorical exaggerations in the service of a deeper underlying truth. <br /> <br />If we agree that Starbucks is not going to be beaming advertising directly into your cerebral cortex any time soon, it behooves us to ask why we're so sure. Because that corporation would certainly have the modesty and decency not to saturate our environment with their product and advertising? Uh... hmm...  Because of the fundamental respect they have for our individuality? Well, probably not. (And why should they? If you're getting your coffee at Starbucks, how individual do you think you are?)  Because scientists would never lend themselves to such a dehumanizing project? Their record strongly suggests otherwise. Because no one would ever sign up for it? Do you know how many hours of television the *average* American watches in a day to numb them to the alienated misery of their life? [And who says you'll have a choice? How much choice did you have about getting your kid injected with a disease... excuse me, I meant \\"immunized\\"? Or having them assigned a tracking number... excuse me, I meant \\"Social Security number\\"?] Because it's just too science fictional? Not a safe bet. Could you have imagined 20 years ago how the Internet would change your life? Not just the convenience of book buying on Amazon, of course, but the end of written correspondence and the skyrocketing of identity theft? <br /> <br />If you're honest, I think you'll have to concede Jensen's real point here. Which is that if Starbucks is not *already* beaming advertising directly into your cerebral cortex, it is only because the Machine has not yet provided them with the means for doing so. And that the Machine will *inevitably* seek out this power (or some more cost-efficient alternative) to make you abetter-fitting cog for its operation - in the pious name of \\"boosting the economy\\" or \\"homeland security\\", of course. <br /> <br />So long story short: the Machine is already at least 90% finished \\"processing\\" the indigenous peoples of the world, the large fish population, and first-growth forests into corpses (fishsticks and junk-mail brochures are corpses too) - which is its ultimate Product. In the course of that achievement, it has created measurable level of dioxins in the breast milk of every woman on the planet, flushed away millions of tons of topsoil, and set us speeding down the path to irreversible global warming. Our middle-class American hope is that It will be kind enough to stop there - while we can \\"enjoy\\" our frozen dinners, SUVs, and \\"reality shows\\" - without killing all of us as well. <br /> <br />But a Machine doesn't have feelings. And it has gotten terribly efficient at what it does.	2005-09-12

Entertaining, wasn't it? But what if you actually experienced what \\"Mr. Anderson\\" did?  If, after years of nagging anxiety and discontent, someone offered you a red pill with the promise that it would show you the truth? And after you swallowed it, what you learned about yourself and the world you've always known was sickeningly horrible?  <br /> <br />Since you are reading this review, you have probably felt that anxiety and discontent. Well, make no mistake. This book is the red pill. After it has shown you how deep the rabbit hole goes, there is no going back. <br /> <br />In order to persuade the reader of that which will be fearfully denounced by every fiber of their being, Jensen is obliged to build his argument slowly. For hundreds of quietly riveting pages, he calmly tells stories... makes connections... offers a crumb of food for thought. The effect is cumulative. Things start to make an awful kind of sense. <br /> <br />Then on page 592 [talk about burying the lead!] Jensen almost offhandedly fuses it all into a single 19-word sentence that should change your perception forever. Partly because you won't believe the truth of that sentence without all the advance preparation - and partly because I want to lure you into reading the book - I'm not going to quote it. Suffice it to say that I feel I have finally seen things as they are. <br /> <br />Intrigued?

And its unavoidable omissions silently state uncountable thousands more. So even a near-dilettante like myself will have no trouble carping over some of them. But when it takes a position significantly outside the consensus, it usually says so up front. And you won't have to waste any mental energy deciding how much of an adjustment to make for Penguin's notorious \\"Britannia rules the audio-waves\\" bias. But most decisively for me, it's simply a great deal more enjoyable to peruse. Part of that is the cleaner layout, but mostly it's the writing - concise, informative, and frank.  <br /> <br />P.S. It's too gross a provocation to bear: To blandly say, as it does on page 36, that Glenn Gould's 1981 recording of the Goldberg Variations is \\"widely regarded as the definitive piano version\\" is nonsense on stilts. It's widely regarded as inferior in vigor and charm to his legendary and much-beloved version from the Fifties which - despite the revolution it sparked in Bach performance and the strange new celebrity it created - isn't even mentioned!

Her revivifying doses of occasional wit are actually amusing - unlike the Borscht Belt shtick found in the &quot;For Dummies&quot; volumes. And there's no bullstuff either. One section is aptly titled &quot;How To Turn Off Annoying Features&quot;. And when she finds the DirectCursor feature more of a menace than an asset, she tells you in plain words to avoid it.

The book is not assigned in schools, and yet it has been a continuously strong seller for 47 years now despite its daunting bulk and lengthy sermonizing. Obviously, there is something in it that speaks to people.<br />Many here would say that it merely flatters the adolescent reader (whatever their age) and their sense of themselves as an unappreciated but superior person. There is a large grain of truth in that, and I think only a die-hard Randian would feel the need to dispute it.<br />But there's another way of looking at that. One could just as easily say that it pays tribute to humanity's desire to better itself. And Rand did say so herself, with what must have been wearying frequency.<br />The novel is written with the crude emphaticness of allegory. (You will never need to wait to find out whether a character is one of the good guys or the bad guys.) The critics don't seem to mind that when they encounter it in &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot;. But that style is very out of fashion now, and it opens the book to, in my opinion, determinedly wrong-headed criticisms of its &quot;flat&quot; characters and &quot;stagy&quot; dialogue. Those who complain that it isn't written like &quot;Madame Bovary&quot; are saying in effect (to borrow C.S. Lewis's phrase): &quot;Of course I don't like brown cheese. It isn't dry sherry.&quot;<br />As for the book's notorious philosophy, I think it futile to deny that, in its purest form, it is equally unworkable and unattractive. The same can be said of Plato's &quot;The Republic&quot;, of course, so that is perhaps a soft indictment. The real point is that there are legitimate and unsettling ideas to be reckoned with here.<br />And for what it's worth: I used to believe in socialism. After I read this book, I didn't any more.	2004-05-16

This could easily have been boiled down to a lengthy magazine piece for Sports Illustrated. And his prose is merely serviceable - far short of George Will's eloquent standard.<br />I'm not familiar enough with the background of this debate to say whether his ideas are &quot;original&quot; or not. But they're certainly plausible enough to warrant examination. My only real beef with them is philosophical in nature, I suppose. He repeatedly insists that the few superstar players asked to sacrifice under his salary cap proposal could easily afford the loss.<br />First of all: they wouldn't be &quot;asked&quot; anything. They would be legally prohibited from earning their full market worth. Say it's &quot;for the good of the game&quot; if you like, but that seems like one slippery damned slope to me. Second: I don't know if that's a judgment you're entitled to make, Bob. I'm sure you're making plenty of scratch these days too. Feel free to donate as much of your salary to the Expos - in the name of &quot;competitive balance&quot; - as you like.

That job gives one a unique perspective on popular literature. When a new Tom Clancy comes out, rather than thinking, &quot;I wonder if he'll have to promote Jack Ryan to Pope now,&quot; you think, &quot;Where the #@$% am I going to stack these forty 60-pound cartons, and what will be left of my sacroiliac when I'm done?&quot;<br />When the new installment of &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; came out [number 6? number 7? Even the fans seem to be having a hard time telling them apart now] there was genuine excitement among the geekier book clerks to get their grubby little hands on a loaner copy before the book officially went on sale. [That's one of the few perks of working there. For example: I knew the shockingly lame ending of Thomas Harris's &quot;Hannibal&quot; before anyone else could even buy a copy.] One tried to evangelize me to the faith but as soon as he started saying things like &quot;Aes Sedai&quot; and &quot;Nynaeve&quot; my eyes glazed over. By that point, I had already unpacked, scanned, and security tagged hundreds of different fantasy titles - all with the same gibberish names [Tolkien was a professional linguist, folks - don't try this at home!], cheesy magic tricks, animatronic monsters, and epic quests against the Supreme Evil Whosit. His break finally ended and he went back to showing you good people where the cookbooks are and I went back to my box cutter and styrofoam &quot;peanuts&quot;.<br />But having a primitive interest in all things Really Big [I love Wal-Mart, for example - even though I know how evil it is], I kept WoT in the back of my mind as the series continued to grow in size. What if it was really as good as the geek had said? Imagine the Wagnerian power that would have been amassed by the end after 9,000 pages [three times as long as &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;!] of build-up. So I stopped by here to see what the faithful had to say...<br />Well, you know the rest. It seems obvious to me that Jordan is in the same situation that Chris Carter was with &quot;The X-Files&quot; [another geek fave that left me cold]. He managed to beguile people at the outset with intriguing portents, found himself in possession of a money-cow he lacked the willpower to walk away from, and thus was forced to keep artifically prolonging the suspense [at the cost of complicating things until even he couldn't untangle it any more] until people finally stopped caring. <br />The hundreds and hundreds of betrayed Jordan fans here bemoaning their lost youth, money, and eyesight [let's stop piously invoking &quot;the trees&quot; though, shall we? Unless you volunteer your time to planting programs or contribute at least $100 a year to environmental groups, you're just advertising your hypocrisy] might have known better. The man isn't a prophet, after all - just a scribbling hack who got lucky. And until *you* walk away from a pile of money, you are in no position to sit in judgment on him. But we all choose our heroes and we all suffer the inevitable disappointment. That's what heroes are for, I guess.<br />And to those die-hards trying to convince themselves that Jordan must be &quot;building up to something&quot; in the next book [or maybe the one after that? ...], I can only quote Sir Ian Holm's immortal line in &quot;Alien&quot;: &quot;I can't lie to you about your chances. But you have my sympathies.&quot;	2003-12-13

Since that book doesn't exist (and would be as thick as an unabridged dictionary if it did), I would - by a narrow margin - pick Weingerg as my one book on the subject if I could have only one.<br />There simply aren't two covers anywhere with as much of the whole vast story between them. Although Weinberg is more interested in the drag on Germany's industrial capacity from the cessation of Turkish exports of chromium than on a Leningrad mother hauling the frozen corpse of her starved child behind her on a sled (less a scholar's tunnel vision than a reasoned decision to do one thing well rather than many things poorly), no one I know of has given a fuller and clearer account of why everything happened the way it did. <br />To address some of the criticisms of the book I've read here: I agree that the few maps provided are ludicrously inadequate - a shoddy afterthought that can only have raised the book's already considerable price. (At least they're tucked away in the back of the book where you can comfortably ignore them.) However, the prose - while not as spry as Keegan's admirable standard - should be perfectly intelligible to anyone intelligent enough to be tackling a book of this scope in the first place. Here's what I consider to be a representative sample: \\"Until access to the Soviet archives enables scholars to see more clearly into these murky episodes, this author will remain convinced that it was the shock of German military revivalso soon after the great Soviet victory at Stalingrad which reinforced Stalin's inclinations during 1943 to contemplate the possibility of either a separate peace with Hitler's Germany or with some alternative German government.\\" Not Clancy, but not Clausewitz either.	2003-09-14

Lewis Signature Classics: Mere Christianity, The Screwtape Letters, A Grief Observed, The Problem of Pain, Miracles, and The Great Divorce (Boxed Set)	Books	5	67	72	N	N	500 stars for the books. A question mark for the set.	The books grouped together in this boxed set are - taken together - unquestionably the greatest achievement in modern Christian apologetics. (If I hesitate to place them alongside something like St. Augustine's &quot;The City of God&quot;, it is only because their cultural contexts are so different that it would be comparing apples and oranges; not because I necessarily think Lewis's achievement is any smaller.) Years of exposure to their ultra-lucid and gracious discourse (such a tonic for the harangues of the televangelists!) - voluntarily sought out for the sheer pleasure of his elegant prose - gradually brought me from pugnacious atheism to (much to my surprise) a church pew. So if you're coming to Lewis with anything less than a hermetically sealed mind, be warned by my example. As he wryly puts it, an atheist can't be too careful what he reads.<br />That said, from a consumer's point of view, I would only feel confident recommending this set to the converted Lewis-ite who wants a uniform edition of the central works. (Though the surprising absence of his spiritual autobiography &quot;Surprised by Joy&quot; will need to be remedied somehow.) The artsy photographs on the covers are decent and the type is pleasantly sized (although a bit more watery than prose this solid deserves). The gift-giver who wants to introduce someone to the pleasures of Lewis would do better with the beguiling (and invitingly slim) single volume &quot;The Great Divorce&quot;. (Others would propose the popular and entertaining &quot;The Screwtape Letters&quot;. They might be right. But I stand firm.) Then - the following Christmas perhaps - &quot;Mere Christianity&quot;, which explains what is being offered. And then &quot;Miracles&quot;, which satisfied me at least that it wasn't too good to be true. And only then &quot;The Problem of Pain&quot;, which wrestles manfully with the difficult, perhaps unanswerable stuff.	2003-07-26

The Apocrypha are included, naturally. (You don't have to read them, of course, but you will have to pay for them.) But the Old Testament is also respectfully referred to as &quot;The Hebrew Bible&quot;. And all dates are given as BCE/CE rather than BC/AD. The annotations are just as scrupulously free of denominational bias. Of course, the only way it can manage that is by avoiding religious interpretation altogether. This makes the book less useful to those looking for an in-depth treatment of their particular faith, I suppose. But that's also what makes it invaluable to those of who are still &quot;waiting in the hall&quot; - as C.S. Lewis put it. That, combined with the title's decades of acceptance by men far more learned in the subject than I (and just the general classiness of the OUP), means I *trust* this Bible as I do no other I've seen on the market - as one can only trust someone who isn't trying to sell you anything. And, without wading too far into the muddy and turbulent waters of the translation issue, let me register my opinion that the New Revised Standard Version used here strikes me as the most literal translation that can still be considered good English. (It doesn't read with the absolute clarity of a good thought-for-thought version like the Good News Translation, but it far excels the New American Standard Bible - generally considered the single most literal English version - and the mega-popular but lamentable New International Version, which doesn't even have all-out-literalism as an excuse.)<br />Furthermore, as a specimen of book manufacture, the New Oxford Annotated Bible is a giant among dwarves. The uncluttered double columns of text [11-pt. Times New Roman, I'm guessing] and single column of annotations at the bottom of the page, set with half-inch margins, printed on opaquer-than-average paper, is more readable than any non-Giant Print Bible I've ever seen. The words of Jesus are not printed in red, but if you're afraid you'll lose track of them, you can always highlight them with a red marker and draw pointing arrows labelled &quot;Over Here!&quot;	2003-07-08

(Although this would clearly seem to make the original \\"Yesterday's New International Version\\", Zondervan quickly reassured everyone that the NIV would still receive its full corporate support.) Much to their surprise, their marketing effort ran into a brick wall of resentment and criticism from the \\"right wing\\" of Christianity, who nervously shrieked that their faith was about to be emasculated. (There are several websites detailing their complaints, if you're interested.) Zondervan meekly protested that it wasn't as if they had Jesus attending the Last Supper in drag (follow the \\"Today's NIV Information\\" link provided here by Amazon for the company's cautiously mounted defense), but the damage was already done. Distinguished men roused themselves to officially condemn the translation and some Christian bookstores vowed to boycott.<br />One can almost see their point. After all, if unabashed male supremacy and anti-Semitism can't find support in the Bible, who else is going to stand up for it? Those of us a little less worried over establishing that Yahweh has a Y chromosome can exploit the controversy by examining and even downloading the entire translation from the Zondervan website (same link), where the company has been forced to post it (in Portable Document Format) as a public relations measure. <br />Once you have done so, it becomes easy to look past the tempest-in-a-teapot controversy over the inclusive language and see the TNIV/NIV (they are 93% identical, the company says) for the awkward compromise translation it always has been - far more clumsy and obscure than a good thought-for-thought version like the Good News Translation and far less accurate than a good literal translation like the New Revised Standard Version.	2003-07-08

And - if we can assume that the ultimate purpose of any such book is to increase our affection for the author - one the most successful. <br />Now I've never considered Snoop a particularly exemplary rapper. The enjoyable flavor [I'm white, okay? If I wrote \\"flava\\", I'd deserve to have my car radio stolen] of his stoned drawl aside, I just don't see how big a claim you can make for an annunciatory couplet as banal as \\"One, two, three, and to the four / Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door\\". But even if Mr. Broadus does pull his punches when it comes to Suge Knight's reign of terror [hey, are *you* prepared to tweak the guy off?], he is as honest about his coming-up as anyone could ask for. And his descriptions of both the good times and the bad times in the L.B.C. are truly evocative. His concise account of how life in the ghetto and life in jail reveal themselves as opposite sides of the same coin is worth 100 books full of pedantry from (white) TV talking-heads about \\"the problem of the underclass\\". Frankly, if his raps were as educational as this book, Snoop would actually accomplish what Chuck D. was trying to pull off for so many years. I hope he goes for it instead of minding his scrilla with unchallenging panegyrics to blunts and booty.	2003-05-26

But it's difficult to watch her travel from the genuinely caring (if certainly narrow and occasionally hypocritical) community of \\"Jesus Freaks\\" to the group of adolescently self-absorbed, really flaming jerks she gives herself over to in graduate school and not feel that she's thrown out the baby with the bathwater.<br />I've always thought Anna Karenina was just a deluded hussy, so I'm trying to reserve judgment on Briggs's decision to walk away from her loving but predictable husband and their three children to enjoy a mid-life swoon over literary Ireland. (Although she claims otherwise, I'm sorry: by the time you reach 40, you ought to be mature enough to realize that relishing one's exquisite sensitivity to Yeats is no substitute for behaving decently towards one's fellow human beings.) But one thing I'm not afraid to say is that - even if you're prepared to take it for granted that the cold truth of existentialism is preferable to the comforting fantasy of a Being who counts the fall of every crow - this book is a very ineffective advertisement for the secular life.	2003-05-26

Open this book to any random page and you'll hear it. It's there in the ridiculously predictable way Russell bends over backwards to interpret the data in the way most favorable to her thesis. (Which is, in a nutshell: it's not just that men commit basically all sexual abuse, it's the *fundamental* nature of their sexuality that leads them to do it. In other words: men are beasts. Got that?) It's there in her perpetually slanting adjectives. And it's *so* there in my favorite chapter heading: \\"Female Incest Perpetrators: Why Are There So Few Of Them?\\" Gee, maybe because Russell deliberately excluded all men from her survey? Or because, even when one of her female subjects describes incestuously abusing her younger brother, she blandly admits, \\"[The brother's experience] wouldn't have been counted in our survey because our methodology was only designed to collect experiences where the woman was the victim - not the victimizer.\\" (Read that sentence again and tell me this is a work of science.) Don't feel too bad for that kid though. Russell is quick to assure us that people abused by women are less traumatized by the experience. And besides: those female perpetrators were usually victimized by a *man* in the first place!<br />And guess what? All four blurbs on the back cover of the book are from other female academics. Anyone want to bet on what model axe *they* use?	2003-05-19

But the fundamental premise (basically: the casinos will do anything to screw you out of your money, so here's how to sink to their level) is not only self-demeaning (who could consider days spent trying to weasel their way into a crummy buffet a vacation anyway?), but almost certain to fail even on its own terms. As some other reviewers here have correctly pointed out, one bad streak at the tables will completely wipe out whatever paltry &quot;gains&quot; the comp-grubber may have nickel-and-dimed their way into.

I found the former more engaging than the latter, but neither seems to completely have its head together, so to speak.    Simons is a familiar kind of super-achieving, high-school-literary-magazine-editing go-go-girl. (The kind who gets book deals in her 20s, in other words.) She describes her descent into antidepressant-triggered psychosis with chilling clarity. But she doesn't seem to have any insight into how strongly her literary project smacks of mania-fueled grandiosity, or how close to potential institutionalization it brings her.    This (sadly) ties in with the pathos of her interview subjects - only the last of which comes even within squinting distance of being the kind of young, successful, happening, date-able Psychiatric Illness Survivor [Elizabeth Wurtzel, in other words] with which Simons would like to inspire the sufferers of this horrifying affliction. If anything, this book only succeeds in conveying (even if against its intention) how discouraging the odds really are.	2003-01-28

So I can't tell you whether it will teach \\"fishers of men\\" how to improve their net-casting technique. All I can tell you is that it deepened my pessimism over whether \\"them\\" and \\"us\\" can ever really get along.    Here is a man so confident that he has the answers to The Big Questions that he has the optimism (or presumption - I'm still not sure which) to classify we several billion non-believers as \\"pre-Christians\\". And since he sincerely believes that his exertions can save me from an eternity of torture in Hell, I guess one can be grateful (in the abstract, at least) that he's taken the trouble.    But every cult thinks its followers are better off. And each has its own seriously-considered recruitment methods. And the only difference between a cult and a religion is how much money and power it has. (Just ask the Mormons, who took only 100 years to go from one to the other.)

(And the Bible, in theory at least, is supposed to transport you a lot farther.) So many competing translations, so many different \\"features\\". (Would you believe metal covers?) I looked at literally dozens of different products before settling on this slow-but-steady-selling edition and I'm perfectly satisfied.<br />Before we get to the contentious issue of translation, there's an even more fundamental matter to consider - the physical manufacture of the book. All the \\"slim\\" and \\"compact\\" volumes are a bad joke - paper so thin you can read both sides at once, and print so miniscule that I defy you to get through ten chapters without getting a splitting headache. The perfect editions for people who want to bestow, own, or be seen owning a Bible but have no expectation of it ever being read. (That's okay. God loves you too.) You can ignore the paperbacks too, unless you've gotten the Good News courtesy of a stretch in one of our penal institutions and are really short of money. The hardcovers are just a little more expensive in most cases, will last ten times as long, and are ten times more pleasant to use. Eliminate all the ones with poor fonts and inadequate margins and you've seriously narrowed the field. This edition doesn't engage in the tacky (but popular) practice of printing the words of Jesus in red, but if you're afraid you'll lose track of them otherwise, you could always mark the pages with a red highlighter and draw arrows labelled \\"Over Here!\\"<br />As for the translations, arguing their respective merits and demerits is as fun (and unsettleable) as picking All-Time sports teams, but unless you're fluent in Koine Greek - in which case you need to get out more - the only important question is whether it reads well enough that you'll actually want to read the blessed thing. (The theological disagreements that arise are so trivial when you really get down to it that it's hard to imagine even God caring about them much. I mean none of the translations out there read: \\"No one comes to the Father if he's a Presbyterian.\\") And on that score, the Good News Translation trumps all others, in my considered opinion. I suppose The Message is even easier to read, if you can stomach the idea of Jesus sounding like a used-car salesman with a *really* great deal. But among the serious translations, this is the only one that doesn't have the weird verbal contortions and spasms that scream \\"I'm translated!\\" (The best-selling NIV seems to suffer from Tourette's Syndrome, by comparison.)

As such, I'm situated interestingly halfway between the fierce anti-death penalty advocacy of the lawyers I work for (and crusading nuns)and the actual felons who call me from jail all day long. [Perhaps half are merely \\"accused felons\\", having only misdemeanor convictions in their past (though usually a bunch of those). The rest though are real straight-up convicted felons, not infrequently with more than one felony charge pending against them simultaneously. I call them our \\"frequent flyers\\".]<br />Most of these criminals [the wrongly accused client is a rare enough occurence to be office-wide gossip when one comes along] are drug addicts busted for some meth in their car (found after a cop pulls them over for running a red light - duh!) or forging a prescription for painkillers. The whiners and manipulators among them can be fiercely irritating to deal with, but even the most recidivistic of them are more pathetic than scary. The lucky ones get public funding for treatment; the rest get to live out the addiction lifestyle [poverty, jail, etc.] that they chose for themselves. [Yes, I still believe in free will - supported by the evidence of those people born into equally disadvantaged circumstances who choose *not* to use meth, heroin, etc.] May God have mercy on them all.<br />Then there are the scary ones - the sociopaths who molest children, rape women, and shoot people with guns. Go ahead and feel sorry for the innocent children they were - if you have time. Having listened to their self-pity, remorselessness, and cynical attempts to manipulate the advocacy system our society generously provides them, I'm more concerned that they be locked away for as long as possible - since, in all but the rarest cases, they are already long past the point where they can be redeemed as human beings.<br />I don't know the exact statistics, but my informed guess is that maybe 1 out of 100 people who kill are successfully convicted of capital muder in a death penalty state. Of those, maybe 1 out of 100 is actually receives a death sentence. And of those, maybe 1 out of 100 is actually executed. So before you get all worked up with visions of every mentally retarded black teenager who nervously shoots a cashier in a liquor store hold-up being forcibly strapped into Old Sparky by a bunch of beefy jeering rednecks, take a reality check.<br />You say that executing people is more expensive than locking them away for life? Well, if money is your main concern, it would be even cheaper not to fund jails at all or hire police to catch them in the first place. You say the death penalty isn't a deterrent? Look at the crime figures in Texas - the only state that actually enforces the death penalty on any kind of consistent basis - and get back to me. You say that most of the people executed are blacks who kill whites? Well, if denying justice to white victims because they were killed in a pro-white racist society is your idea of fairness, go send O.J. Simpson a check to cover his legal bills.	2003-01-10

It's a genre that I particularly enjoy and I think Will makes a solid case for all four of his subjects.

(Same thing with Robert Crumb's obsession with Sheena of the Jungle or today's cybergeeks and their Jessica Alba fansites.) I would bet a Near Mint copy of Detective Comics #27 that the panel of WW with one leg on the hood of a getaway car she's just stopped, beckoning with a crooked finger for the miscreants to step out and take their medicine, will sell 100 times more copies of this book than the one of her cradling a small black child she's just rescued.<br />This all relates to the other contradiction at the heart of WW. William Moulton Marston originally created the character to be an inspiring figure for young girls and we know of at least one instance - Gloria Steinem - where it worked out that way. But it's adolescent boys of all ages who actually buy (and create) the comics. Even accepting Diana's Playboy Bunny-ish costume as a given, Alex Ross's paintings present just a few too many \\"[from behind] shots\\" for us to have any illusions about which gender of reader is being inspired, or in what way.	2002-04-28

For one thing, I have never been convinced (even by a writer as formidable as William Faulkner) that there is anything noble or poetic about killing animals for fun, no matter how much the dog may enjoy helping us do it. And what if Colter had been just a dumb sweet mutt with housebreaking lapses? Would he have been any less deserving of tribute?

Remembering how my initial fascination with that novel was drowned by the bewildering and ultimately awful *too-muchness* of that book, I asked the professor what he made of Brodkey. \\"He's insane, of course,\\" was the ready reply.<br />Well, that might be oversimplifying the matter, but on re-reading \\"This Wild Darkness\\" recently, I decided that, for all its occasional brilliance in describing what it feels like to be inside a dying body, the professor's comment tells more of the story than it might seem at first glance - enough certainly for anyone who approaches Brodkey with a not unreasonable degree of skepticism. All too often, the author's observations about others and - his great subject - himself, have a strong whiff of delusional unreality about them. When he says that his \\"irresistability\\" as a young man was such that it led to people trying to abduct him, I simply don't believe him. The great James Salter, in his own memoir, remembers the younger, on-the-make, Brodkey-in-the-Sixties as a \\"troublemaker\\" and that sounds convincingly right. <br />And yet Brodkey must have had something going for him all those years when he managed to convince a few influential tastemakers that he was an unheralded genius and I believe he did. His mature style - a heterogenous mix of colloquial intimacy and ambitious abstraction - was truly unique and, at its occasional best, as surpassingly expressive as his literary padrones claimed. \\"This Wild Darkness\\", composed during a terminal illness, understandably does not represent this style at its highest pitch but it is still something that absolutely no one else could have written.

But this peculiarly intense novella does deserve as much recognition as the more widely heralded &quot;Cheri&quot; and &quot;Claudine&quot; books.<br />What stands in its way is a sophistication and subtlety so profoundly French that, even translated into English, the narrative sometimes seems to be in a foreign language. The nearest American literature equivalent I can think of is Henry James's &quot;The Sacred Fount&quot;, which is also a love story explored on such a psychologically deep level that it can be hard to know what exactly is going on.<br />But even at her murkiest, Colette never fails to provide a spectacular mimesis of the natural world. The reader may all but recline in the flower-filled meadows, the warmth of the sun on his face cooled by fragrant breezes.

Henry Miller wrote, \\"No one - not even God - knows what a man suffers on the inside.\\" So I'll give Elizabeth Wurtzel, the human being, the benefit of the doubt and assume that her pain (whose nature is never made quite clear, but seems to have something to do with her mother not understanding her) is as authentic and deserving of our human sympathy as that of Diana Spencer (whose death Wurtzel mourns, \\"just because she was so pretty\\"), the World Trade Center victims (to whom Wurtzel is apparently indifferent, but who probably weren't that good looking on average), or, for that matter, you or me.<br />On the other hand, Elizabeth Wurtzel, the narrator of this book, had better hope that God loves her because it's not likely that too many other people will. (Her editor, who lets Wurtzel hole up in the publisher's offices during her terminal coke binge to insure the completion of her second book, doesn't count.) To describe her as \\"narcissistic\\" would be hopelessly inadequate. Enraptured self-involvement on this scale approaches the sociopathic. It would be one thing if the self being celebrated were a writer as insightful and masterly as, say, Colette. But when the best you can muster is urban-zingy wisecracks, not infrequently plagiarized from rock lyrics (note to Wurtzel: if you're going to rip off a Paul Westerberg lyric - i.e. \\"waitress in the sky\\" - it's not very smart to epigraph your chapter with another Paul Westerberg lyric), the result is pretty pathetic.<br />\\"More, Now, Again\\" does represent an artistic advance for the authoress, inasmuch as her photograph appears on the back cover rather than the front, and that she doesn't appear nude in it. (It is a large color photograph that takes up the entire back of the dust jacket, and she does pout rather come-hitherly in it, but still.) But how well can you identify with an addiction narrative when hitting bottom consists of - I swear I'm not joking - sleeping through an opportunity to do a photo shoot for Coachbags?	2002-02-26

(If you dig past the nostalgic plethora of period detail in the Rabbit books, there really isn't a great deal there.) But 20 years after accidentally discovering Henry Bech on the shelves of the public library (just as Updike has said he likes to imagine people encountering his books), his hapless exploits with women and the Muse continue to provide me with unfailing pleasure. It's a fine service to American literature to have them all - including the previously uncollected story \\"His Oeuvre\\", one of the best - gathered together between one set of hardcovers.<br />There is however, I'm sad to say, a big ugly boil on the butt of this otherwise handsome volume: the semi-infamous \\"Bech Noir\\", in which Updike, seemingly grown disgusted with the continuing durability of his character, jerks him through a sour ludicrous pantomime - the sheer awfulness of which makes it almost impossible to look at him the same way again. .... It's as if Frank L. Baum, around the fourth or fifth Oz book, had Dorothy move to Los Angeles where she became a crack whore. After that, the valedictory tale in which Bech most implausibly receives the Nobel Prize comes across as simply another gesture of contempt - whether towards the Swedish Academy, for honoring the even-less-qualified Toni Morrison rather than himself, or towards the reader, I can't say. All I can tell you - strange advice, I know - is to skip those two stories if you haven't been contaminated by them already.	2002-01-01

(Though, judging from the other reviews here, I would be inclined to trust it.) I can say that this is the most impressively comprehensive, most sheerly appetizing travel guide I have ever seen. (If you can't afford to actually go there, this is definitely the next best thing.) 1,416 pages of small print (printed on bible paper, to keep the volume at a convenient size) is a Mahabharata-sized bushel of information, no matter how you slice it. (The data is all consistently organized so you can slice it any way you want.) To pick a completely random example, what other guide will tell you that when in Murud-Janjira not only can you get a good meal in the Vinayak restaurant, but that you should especially try the Chicken Manchurian soup?... The supplemental material on the country, particularly the \\"Hinduism for Dummies in a Hurry\\" section (my title, not theirs), is especially fine - a model for the field.

It simply presents the great historian's work in a more easily digested portion - a consumer service for which I personally am quite grateful. <br />While the Vicksburg campaign, being (in my simple opinion, anyway) more of coup de grace than a turning point, lacks the supreme drama of the battle at Gettysburg (magnificently presented in Foote's &quot;The Stars In Their Courses&quot;, over which I have raved elsewhere), it is an amazing story in its own right. As always, not only does Foote brilliantly limn the military action with stirring prose of an almost Homeric grandeur, he unearths the small human details that bring the long-ago events to life with shuddering poignancy. (i.e. A Union commander preparing to assault a Confederate fort at daybreak reports that from behind the enemy's walls he heard &quot;the prettiest reveille I ever did hear&quot;, or General McClernand maintaining his military reserve even as a distraught Southern woman defiantly sings &quot;The Bonnie Blue Flag&quot; right in his face.) He is fortunate, of course, to be studying a period in which even humble footsoldiers, steeped in the cadences of the King James Bible, commanded a musical quality of rhetoric that puts today's orators to shame. (i.e. A disgruntled newspaper editor begs his political friend to convince Lincoln that General Grant is &quot;a jackass in the original package&quot;, and a captured Union officer gallantly inquires of his captors, &quot;Is this the Army of the Confederacy for which I have so long and earnestly sought? Then, sirs, I am your guest for the duration.&quot;)<br />A very special treat is the audio edition, read by Foote himself in a smoky Mississippi drawl that could not be bettersuited to the text. It's akin to hearing the great national epic patiently recited by the Voice of America itself.	2002-01-01

Salinger. Of course, it would never have been published either, so let's get down to brass tacks. As an \\"expose\\" of The Creep Behind The Artist, the prosecution is scattershot (there's a wearisomely prolonged and ultimately unconvincing effort to define him as an actual cult leader of sorts) but eventually sways the jury. And unlike the unsympathetic Joyce Maynard, who managed to cash in with her story first, Margaret Salinger seems to me fully entitled to whatever degree of payback this book represents. (It's not a hatchet job but she's not afraid to let hard-earned bitterness show at times.) When, as a teenager, she finally begins to see his toxicity as a parent and writes in her diary, ...it's a real stand-up-and-cheer moment.<br />However, it must be acknowledged that the book is in desperate need of strong editing. The indiscriminate inclusiveness (i.e. the complete text of notes passed in junior high school) and irritatingly pointless footnotes (i.e. explaining where the chapter heading \\"To Sir With Love\\" comes from) are unfortunate deterrents to appreciating this book on its considerable merits.	2001-12-31

(As a celebrity, at any rate; her acting career has been undistinguished at best. And to judge by the absence of any consideration of the craft in these pages, it seems clear that she only drifted into acting for lack of qualifications to do anything else.) And the (ghost)writing here is of decent quality, though its occasional detours into New Age lyricism have a high &quot;oh please&quot; quotient.<br />But let's be honest: the only question a potential buyer will have is, &quot;How much dirt does she dish on Woody?&quot; Well, she falls short of Maynard's impressive benchmark but not for lack of trying. Her portrait of Allen as a cold, manipulative, predatory, all but slavering child molester is devastating. If you believe only half of it (which is my percentage, give or take), you will never look at him again without a sense of moral nausea.<br />Yet Farrow never converts me to her sense of outrage. Her account is so fanatically accusatory (quite unavoidably given her convictions, I suppose) that it creates an inadvertent current of sympathy for the Peter Lorre-ish figure that she's stalking through the sewers. And then, not to put too fine a point on it, she's not a very appealing character herself - silver-plattered (she was the Gwyneth of her day), mousy, not very bright. By her own admission, not only did she stay with Allen after her suspicions surfaced because she was eager to keep appearing in his films (at least she has the decency to beg her children's forgiveness for this), she actually went back to complete several days of reshoots on &quot;Husbands and Wives&quot; *after* she discovered the pornographic photographs that proved he was having sex with her daughter. (Just think about that for a minute.) There's also her creepy compulsive adoption of &quot;unplaceable&quot; children - pursued even in the midst of her family meltdown! This narcissistic exploitation of the young to satisfy her unhealthy emotional needs has a lot more in common with Allen's repugnant behavior than she seems to realize.	2001-12-18

By that standard, this is a very sentimental book. In my opinion, none of the three main characters are anywhere near as adorable as the author keeps insisting they are. Their most notable characteristic is a non-stop (and rather interchangeable) flow of campy repartee that might convey tenderness, heartbreak, or whatever to someone steeped in their milieu but which kept me at a considerable emotional distance. The doomed idol in particular is dreadfully flimsy - the author's wet-dream of a perfectly beautiful, perfectly talented, perfectly unattainable (for him) Golden Boy. This sort of wish fulfillment at the reader's expense is no more palatable in a queenly context than it was Hemingway's &quot;butch&quot; one with their impossibly idealized heroines.<br />That said, I was moved in spite of myself, largely due to the author's considerable powers as a prose stylist. And his gift for the telling detail is striking - i.e. the paper found among an AIDS victim's effects listing &quot;100 Words That Rhyme With Pain&quot;. I suspect that other writers have done more with this material but I'm not sorry to have read it.	2001-12-11

In the end though, I can't say it's more than an honorable failure.<br />If the idea was to enrich our understanding of Hemingway by examining him from these feminine angles, it simply doesn't work. The portrait of the author that emerges is less focused and cohesive than that available from any of several orthodox biographies. (Kenneth S. Lynn's seems to me the best single volume study, although some of his theories are less persuasive than others.) And if the real subjects are the women, one has to ask: what was the point? Except for Martha Gellhorn, an intrepid war journalist who has been given her own biography, none of them ever did anything of real interest (or have anything much in common) except become involved with Hemingway. There is a fascinating book to be written about the psychology of literary &quot;groupies&quot; but that doesn't seem to be what the author had in mind.<br />I also wonder if her bias in favor of the women hasn't distorted some facts. While her three-dimensional portrait of Hemingway's mother is a much-needed corrective to his rabid antipathy, she seems to place an unprecedented amount of faith in the credulity of Adriana Ivanich's memoir. (i.e. Kert says, apparently on its authority, that Adriana's drawings for Hemingway's dust jackets were so good that Scribner's selected them without even knowing who she was. Others say that they were so inept that they had to be professionally redrawn before they could be of any use.) Also, she refers to Zelda Fitzgerald's death as taking place in a &quot;hospital&quot;, as if she were recovering from an appendectomy rather than having been institutionalized as insane.	2001-12-09

In the style of Ms. Maynard, I will begin by writing lots of things about myself that can hardly be of interest to you. (If you'd rather know something about the book under discussion, skip to the next paragraph.) I have never read &quot;Catcher in the Rye&quot;, not having taken an English class that obliged me to do so. As an adult, I read &quot;Franny&quot; to see what all the fuss was about. I still didn't see it. I'm as curious about authors who shun publicity as the next person, probably even more so. I respect Salinger for the diligence and success against fierce opposition with which he has guarded his privacy, even as I compromise his efforts by reading this book which, its many pious contentions to the contrary notwithstanding, is obviously a vendetta, and a lucrative one at that - the most fanatically single-minded memoiristic act of payback since Mia Farrow's &quot;What Falls Away&quot;.<br />In one key respect, Ms. Maynard's production cannot be faulted. Her publishers ponied up the dough in exchange for all the dirt on Salinger and the author delivered in full. Thanks to her tireless exertions, those interested may lurk unnoticed in the author's bedroom, observe him as he undresses for lovemaking, and sympathize (or cackle, depending on your feminist sympathies) as he repeatedly fails to &quot;her chaste treasure open&quot;, as Laertes put it.<br />I am in no position to condemn Maynard for this retroactive violation of intimacy; I am, after all, participating in her shabby act by reading the book. But I can take her to task for her stupefyingly artless prose, which follows the famous route to boredom by telling everything. (And I do mean everything. If, unlike me, you opened this book so you could find out which foods her father liked to eat for breakfast, or obtain a list of her favorite childhood TV shows, you won't be disappointed.)<br />So what do we learn of Mr. Salinger? He is a new-age sort of kook, subscribing to quaint Eastern theories of diet and medicine that, while unappetizing and somewhat ridiculous, harm no one but beef industry lobbyists. As a single father in a small New England town, he apparently shops for girlfriends by mail order. This is admittedly unorthodox but perhaps necessary, given his isolation, and strikes me as less than sinister. He seems to like his women young and worshipful, suggesting that he harbors personal insecurities, but in this he seems nothing more peculiar than a member of the human race.<br />The story, in a nutshell, is that the emotionally under-developed (but already career-savvy and ambitious) Maynard is charmed by the flattering attentions of a famous, though creepily older, writer and drops out of Yale to live with him. Their domesticity, like anyone else's, endures its daily irritations. She's a slob, for one thing, leaving banana peels all over the kitchen after she bakes bread. She's also physically frigid, a condition that Salinger treats with notable patience and sensitivity. Her values are diametrically opposed to his. (See &quot;career-savvy&quot; above.) And, I almost forgot, her carelessness allows Time magazine, which had already raked Salinger over the coals in a malicious profile, to get his home phone number...<br />Well, Jerry decides that enough is enough and he sends her packing. His manner is curt (one-sided breakups are usually grim affairs) but he engages in nothing that would strike an objective observer as needlessly cruel. Young Maynard takes it as badly as you would expect a worshipful teenager to take it, but endeavors to cauterize the pain by pursuing her writing career, buying a house (lots of us bought houses at that age, right?), and so on.<br />Actually, this is a pretty dull story so far. The fascinating part comes later when the now-adult Maynard, whose own marriage has failed (gee, I wonder why), who has grown into the kind of person who doesn't go to her mother's funeral because she's sulking over a fight with her sister, with an 18 year old daughter of her own, suddenly decides that she needs closure, or that the young women of the world need to be protected, or that she needs a big payday to cover the balloon payment on her mortgage, or something. She drives to Salinger's house (uninvited, needless to say), walks right up to the back door, and demands the now septuagenarian idol to account for his actions those many, many years ago. (To which another old man might reply, &quot;Eh? What was that, girlie? I don't hear so good anymore.&quot;) Salinger, who, in his cranky way, has always shown himself to be an uncannily apt judge of people's self-serving behavior, immediately recognizes that she's planning to revenge her youthful disappointment with a tell-all. Attacked in his own home, he tells her some unpleasant truths: that she's a hack, for one thing (we, the readers, have long since figured this out for ourselves), and that the only way she can get more of the cheap attention she's always craved is to exploit her connection with him. Seemingly doomed to never get the point, she draws upon her apparently infinite resources of self-pity and says something like &quot;Who exploited who?&quot; and finally goes away, having manufactured the Big Finish that her slapdash book required.<br />I've gone on at length here but this pathetic document could be reviewed in just three words: Oh, grow up.n 18 year old daughter of her own, suddenly decides that she needs closure, or that the young women of the world need to be protected, or that she needs a big payday to cover the balloon payment on her mortgage, or something.

It's written in stark prose that aspires to the taut suggestiveness of Joan Didion or (more likely, given Harrison's penchant for glamour) Marguerite Duras but is more often merely flat and affectless.

I also think, based on the preponderance of evidence, that Ted Hughes, while probably a philandering jerk, can't possibly have been as difficult to live with as his severely neurotic wife (Plath, I mean; he went on to marry an even more desperately screwed-up woman - proving, I guess, that he was what you'd call a slow learner) who was miserably unhappy long before she ever met him.<br />I only read this book because Janet Malcolm used it as Exhibit A in her definitive treatise on the impossibility of objective biography, &quot;The Silent Woman&quot;. (Those interested may consult my trenchant review.)  If she says it is the best available study of Plath's life, I'll take her word for it, but in this case it's not saying much. Whether it was because Olwyn Hughes (a pretty tall glass of buttermilk herself, it would seem) was jerking the marionette strings or whether Stevenson (one of those Americans who, like T.S. Eliot, hope that if they live in England long enough that people will forget their &quot;vulgar&quot; origins) simply came to find Plath as negligible a figure as I do (nothing else could explain her wholesale inclusion of Dido Merwin's malicious hatchet-job - a catty piece of under-the-hair-dryer gossip that any serious biographer would have treated with an entire box of kosher salt), this book feels flimsy and half-baked. From the day of its publication, Plath-ists have set up a banshee wail over its lack of reverence for the Sacred Harpy. (I'm surprised Andrea Dworkin or someone like that never issued a fatwa.)

Anyone with even a slight interest in her must consider this book essential reading.

Put simply, it is the final word on its subject - which is, of course, the act of biography, not Sylvia Plath or Ted Hughes.<br />That Malcolm presents herself as a major figure in the narrative, that she sides with Hughes against Plath (she says so in precisely those words; unlike every other book that addresses the Plath story, the agenda here is explicit, not veiled), is not merely apt but crucial. This, she argues convincingly, is what every biographer does - only usually with less self-awareness and honesty.<br />The point can't be stressed enough - especially as several reviewers here seem to have missed it. Malcolm is only interested in Plath and Hughes (both of whom are more compelling, in my opinion, for the doom-filled lives they led than for their sub-canonical verse) as an unusually illustrative example of the impossibility of &quot;objective&quot; biography. Was he a cruel philanderer? Or was she a neurotic harpy? Or both? Not only don't we know, Malcolm says, we *can't* know. Her argument, presented in crisp epigrammatic prose that is its own unique pleasure, seems to me unanswerable.	2001-12-05
US	53030805	R3RCJSZDGP6VOS	0375407960	929279308	Aretha: From These Roots	Books	2	1	1	N	N	Not enough soul	In my opinion, a memoirist's chief, if not sole, responsibility to their readers is to be honest about themselves. So the fact that Ms. Franklin often expresses a queenly hauteur in this book bothers me not in the slightest. (She is the Queen of Soul, after all, so I figure she's entitled.) And that she presents her hearty, arguably gluttonous, appetites for men and food with lip-smacking relish is entirely to her credit - the best part of the book, in fact. (Did you think that a great soul singer would be the type to clip coupons and come to a full stop at intersections?)<br />But everything that readers have written here about the author's evasiveness when it comes to the most interesting parts of her story are true. (As Bart Simpson critiqued Krusty the Klown's autobiography, &quot;it was self-serving with many glaring omissions!&quot;) To cite only one example, her idealized portraits of her early family life simply ring false. The bald facts are that her parents separated (which could not have been a casual matter for a minister and his wife in the 1950s), she lived apart from her mother for many years (Aretha huffily denies that she was &quot;abandoned&quot;, as many have said, but this was a very peculiar arrangement for the time), she was flogged with a belt for transgressions (not peculiar, sad to say, but can no longer be passed off as simply firm parenting), and while still a teenager she became pregnant not just once but twice (which convinces me that her feelings about the strongly patriarchal rule of the Reverend Franklin - which extended well into her young adulthood - are a lot more complicated than her worshipful descriptions of him would suggest).<br />So you might try this book if you're willing to settle for simply hearing Aretha's &quot;voice&quot; speak in the first person. (The audio version is read by an actress who does a good job of delivering those queenly cadences but it just ain't the same.) But anyone interested in the inner life of a great American artist will have to look elsewhere.	2001-12-05

Her baby-doll vocal delivery and trite lyrics (never trust anyone over the age of six who uses the word &quot;pee-jays&quot;) could be intensely irritating when encountered on the radio but what the hell: to each his own.<br />Then the mega-platinum success of her debut record summoned into being that extraordinary artifact - her &quot;verse&quot; collection &quot;A Night Without Armor&quot;. (Favorite couplet: &quot;A father and son bond / by ogling my breasts&quot;.) For everyone who enjoys watching a celebrity make a towering fool of themselves (and doesn't that describe most of us?), it was like getting a neck rub on Christmas while eating a hot fudge sundae.<br />So you can imagine my anticipation as I approached this de facto sequel - read by the author, no less! And you know what? While I enjoyed a few snickers along the way, I actually ended the tapes liking her a little better than when I started. She was more honest than most celebrity memoirists (i.e. admitting that her looks have furthered her career), she worked diligently to accomplish her goals, and her childhood sounds rather sad and a little creepy. If she's still pretentious and self-obsessed, well, I suppose most of us were at her age.	2001-11-29

Either she's right about the causes of and solutions to the problem of the working poor, or she isn't. The problem is that her book - an anecdotal narrative hoping to pass itself off as serious analysis - is far too shallow to settle the question one way or the other. However, if she wants to persuade me that American economic mobility is a myth, she's going to have to explain why some people - many of whom face more discrimination for being non-Caucasian than she ever will for being female - do in fact rise into the middle class and beyond. (Are their hard work, thrift, and commitment to education &quot;cheating&quot; somehow?) And if she thinks she has learned what poverty is, she might want to speak to a few of the immigrants who literally risk their lives to come here and work at the jobs she found so demeaning. They might be able to expand her definition of under-nourishment beyond that of eating convenience-store burritos.	2001-11-28

(Although, given how dislikable the author's youthful self is - charmlessly naive, blandly self-forgiving as she sleeps with a married professor, etc. - that might be a good thing.) The other 80% is a heartfelt but numbingly repetitive tribute to the author's mentor - an apparently beloved promoter of poetry causes who nonetheless falls short, in my opinion, of living up to the grand claims Norris makes for her. (While offering an unending stream of advice, not all of it solicited, the mentor usually demonstrates nothing more remarkable than a fine grasp of the obvious.) It's an awkward mix that gives the book an unsatisfying shape. Then there's Norris's pedestrian prose (describing her uninformed encounters with campus promiscuity and drug use as &quot;like being Alice in Wonderland&quot;), tedious name-dropping (not even resulting in any good gossip), and ungiftedness at truly understanding herself or anyone else (her portraits of Gerard Malanga and Jim Carroll, just to mention two men she claims were important in her life, are no more insightful than the average celebrity profile in a magazine).<br />The unabridged audio version is a special torment. Sandra Burr sounds a bit like &quot;Fresh Air&quot; host Terry Gross but has a prim, Doris Day-ish sort of delivery that, while faithful to the narration's insipidity, becomes unendurable over the course of 8 hours.	2001-11-26

John Updike once said, when accused of writing unsympathetic protagonists, that it was the author's duty to present believable characters and that the reader was free to like them or not.

Enormous photographs of Anna Kournikova hiking up the panties up her tennis outfit and a Brazilian female beach volleyball player bent forward with her butt pointing at the camera contribute a different sense of unwholesomeness to the proceedings.<br />I suppose younger readers would like all of the above; perhaps Guinness is aiming this book at them.	2001-10-31

I consider my life meaningfully enriched by having read it. (And how many books can you say that about?) I can understand why the author (to whom I give my thanks) pursued the dubious expedient of personally promoting it here. It cries to be read! But I fear that its European sanity with regards to the eternal dance between men and women will always be a foreign tongue to American readers, saddled as we are with the sexual neuroses of our Purtian founders. What Vizinczey has learned about women, and which he has graciously shared with us, is not feminist and it is not politically correct. It is simply true. People who value doctrinal conformity over thoughtful perception had better stick to Oprah-approved novels instead. Those seeking to understand our human nature a little better before it is lost to the grave are well-advised to start here.	2001-10-31

His ode to the glories of Arthur Bryant's Barbecue - The Single Best Restaurant In The World - is a dithyramb worthy of Whitman. He is, in short, a true patriot - albeit one whose vision of multiculturalism is expressed in Italian fried-pepper sandwiches and Polish pierogies. There are lots of laughs in this volume but I value it more for its whole-hearted embrace of our authentic appetites. In a time of spiralling culinary pretention (whose standard bearer is Charlie Trotter and his dishes with paragraph-long names), &quot;The Tummy Trilogy&quot; is a palate-cleansing dish of sanity.	2001-10-31

Although his single-focus books about geology and Alaska are the foundation of his reputation, I find this varied collection of shorter pieces to be the most enjoyable reading. My particular favorite is &quot;Brigade de Cuisine&quot; which details the single-minded dedication of a chef/owner to expressing himself in food. Mouth-watering stuff.<br />(A background story to illustrate the politics of the food world: The chef, who asked McPhee not to identify him, was quoted in the piece as saying that the famous Andre Soltner of Lutece used frozen shrimp in one of his dishes. The outraged Soltner demanded a retraction and McPhee, for perhaps the only time in his career, grudgingly complied. Rallying behind Soltner, its favored son, The New York Times dispatched a reporter to learn the chef's identity. Having done so, they printed a scathing review of his restaurant - one that is hard to reconcile with McPhee's rapturous descriptions of its food. The proof would be in the pudding, so to speak, but this sure sounds like a vendetta to me.)	2001-10-31

It's our loss. If you compare the ambition and artistic discipline of this wise and sober novel to, say, the latest annual installment of navel-gazing from Philip Roth (to name a writer who enjoys a comparable level of esteem today), you can only shake your head at the profound dumbing-down of our culture.<br />Inasmuch as only a fraction of any armed force directly participates in combat, this stunningly broad study of a Florida air force base in the latter stage of World War II is actually more relevant to the history of our participation in that struggle than a book like &quot;The Naked and the Dead&quot;. And its look at an early chapter in the unfinished story of race integration in America is arguably more germane than ever, although its conclusions do not sit comfortably. (No televised talking head could hope to express them and still keep his job.) If you're interested in a truly adult novel, in the best sense of the word, you can't do much better than this one.	2001-10-30

Let's be clear about this: there is *no one* making more beautiful music with the magnificent instrument of the English language than James Salter. If this book were nothing more than a factual recounting of his life story, it would still be a greatly rewarding reading experience.<br />It is, in fact, a great deal more than that. Like Casanova's immortal memoir, this is the work of an old man looking back on the dazzling life he relished but which has vanished forever. As such, a funereal darkness lurks behind every sunlit memory, an abyss of ruin underneath every bejewelled sentence. There is a sad wisdom in these pages that makes &quot;Burning the Days&quot; a timeless classic, belonging to no one generation but to all.	2001-10-30

This is one of them. It helps that Ackroyd has so much space to work with. (In this respect, it's like Jackson J. Benson's &quot;The True Adventures of John Steinbeck, Writer&quot; - also shamefully out of print.) But utimately it's a function of Ackroyd's profound understanding of the various aspects of Dickens' character and genius.

It is not even literature, in any meaningful sense. It is a 2,000 page indictment for crimes against humanity. Chief among the accused is of course Stalin who, if justice exists, is currently serving 60 million consecutive life sentences in Hell. But as Solzhenitsyn abundantly documents, the Gulag death-camps were part of Lenin's vision from the very beginning. (In January 1918, he stated his ambition of &quot;purging the land of all kinds of harmful insects&quot;, in which group he included &quot;workers malingering at their work&quot;.) But it is not only the architects of Bolshevism who stand accused. It is also all the collaborators with oppression, from the camp guards who summarily executed prisoners too exhausted to stand to the people who informed on their neighbors. Complicit even are the passive victims of the Terror who, as Solzhenitsyn says, &quot;didn't love freedom enough&quot; to fight for it from the beginning.<br />Needless to say, &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; is not beach reading. (Although Solzhenitsyn's searingly sarcastic style makes it anything but a dry collection of facts.) The evil that it obsessively documents is so dark that even reading about it is often difficult to bear. But anyone with pretentions of understanding the world we live in needs to go through it from first page to last.<br />But if you aren't willing to make the effort, here's the lesson boiled down for you: Totalitarianism doesn't begin with a Stalin or a Hitler. It begins with *you*, on the day that you let a government become more powerful than the people it governs. Remember that or someday it might not be the Russians or the Jews or the Serbs that the men with guns come for. It just might be you...	2001-06-13

But since &quot;Nothing to Declare&quot; is more of an &quot;inner journey&quot; than a road trip, the author is pretty much the whole show. And by the last page, I was very glad to part company with her.<br />She spends a lot of time stoically lamenting the cruelty of men - both solo and accompanied by her neighbor, a veritable poster child for oppressed Latina womanhood. But judging by the shabby way Morris treats the Mexican man who dotes on her (i.e. sniffing at his enthusiasm for domestic chores while chasing other men at the drop of a hat), her relationship problems would seem to be mostly her fault.<br />This sort of hypocrisy appears throughout the book. Although her only reason for coming to Mexico is to escape the shambles of her life north of the border, she sneers at the other expatriates living in San Miguel - &quot;writers and painters, or so they call themselves&quot;, &quot;losers&quot;, &quot;mediocre Americans&quot;. She blithely claims to be in contact with ghosts and prefers not to waste her palm-reading ability (!) on the unworthy, yet wishes a New Age healer she consults would &quot;skip the mumbo jumbo&quot;.<br />I won't deny the author's writing skills succeeded in holding one's interest. And judging by the comments here (and the fact that it's still in print after a decade - no mean feat), more than a few people have responded to this book. But I won't be travelling with Mary Morris again.	2001-03-06

The author does come across as a tough old crow at times. (I can't imagine why she feels entitled to sneer at hikers who use the Lonely Planet guide.) But who else would have braved such an arduous journey in the first place? I can understand that her opinions about women's issues and the AIDS epidemic might be irritatingly opposed to yours. But isn't one of the points of traveling to meet people who aren't like ourselves?	2001-02-23

Is it the pre-lawyer version, or is this one?)<br />The early sections are a brutally vivid account of Kinski's impoverished childhood and adolescence in Poland. (i.e. &quot;A sow sets a soup plate down on the table before me. It is filled to the brim and the soup sloshes over. Her hands up to her wrists are dunked in the gray muck, where white pieces of fat float around like corpses. I nearly puke.&quot;) You are not likely to forget it. For intensifying wretchedness to an almost metaphysical level, it rivals Kosinki's &quot;The Painted Bird.&quot;<br />While I would like to report that the entire book is on this level, I can't. Once the narrative advances Kinski to steady employment as an actor/whore, the reportage becomes extremely sketchy - less informative and less interesting than a Danielle Steele novel on the subject would be, I suspect. His brief but unforgettable performance in &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; - &quot;I am the only free man on this train!&quot; - receives no more than a paragraph or two.<br />He can't help but devote more space to Werner Herzog, of course, for all his rabid antipathy towards the man. (i.e. &quot;Big red ants should piss in his eyes...&quot;) Yet I can't imagine anyone being satisfied with the meager portions of information Kinski doles out concerning the films that will be his legacy to cinema.<br />The book does not end, so much as run out of tape - exacerbating its quality of shoddiness. I came away with the distinct feeling that Kinski considered this book nothing more than another trick turned for the quick money.	2000-12-29

All was well until I reached &quot;Bech Noir&quot; in which our hero takes murderous (yet flippant) revenge on his literary enemies. This was so ludicrously out of character that I kept waiting for the authorial signal that it was just the protagonist's fantasy. Unfortunately, it never came. I don't know whether Updike was being contemptuous or just plain stupid. But not only did his trashing of my suspension-of-disbelief ruin this book for me, it cast a retrospective pall over the previous ones. <br />Ironically, a new first-rate Bech story appeared in The New Yorker some time later. Presumably, it will be included in the omnibus Bech edition being published in 2001. I only pray that Updike, who is known for his post-publication tinkering, will come to his senses and leave &quot;Bech Noir&quot; out.	2000-12-29

Compressing a century's worth of literary and theatrical analysis of the world's greatest play into a too-brief 971 pages Rosenberg has provided the &quot;Hamlet&quot; aficionado with an inexhaustibly rich resource for exploring its infinite complexities.  Even at seventy smackers, it's a bargain	1997-04-18
