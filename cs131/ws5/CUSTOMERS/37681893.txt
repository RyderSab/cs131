Most of Sokal's supporters have gone out of their way in essays and publications to point up the importance of cultural studies, reasonable relativism, and criticism.  Where they become concerned is when truth claims are all deemed to be left open to a hyper-relativism and subjective interpretation.  While affirming a social critique of science has a quite valuable and definite place and thinking and writing about culture have a very important place within academic environs, scholars favorably inclined towards Sokal's hoax well understand a branch of pomo structuralism had been going off the rails for some time.  (For an in depth overview of this extreme tendency and relativistic phenomenon, as well as countless examples see Bricmont and Sokal's \\"Fashionable Nonsense.\\")  Yes, scientific developments in Newton's time - and obviously myriad technological developments since - have certainly been grounded in and developed from, to a good extent, the needs of capitalist imperial dictates.  One can acknowledge this historical truth while criticizing some of the far out claims by those who have not one kind word for Sokal's attempt to re-emphasize the scientific method.<br /><br />Often it seems for Sokal's detractors there is an either-or-world at work: either one is pro what Sokal did and therefore has little capability of appreciating and learning from sound cultural and scientific criticism and analysis, or on the other side, one finds Sokal's actions contemptible.  Clearly this is an absurd mutually exclusive dynamic, yet it is displayed throughout \\"The Sokal Hoax\\" when one gets to the sections written by Social Text's apologists.  The somewhat routine habit of Sokal's critics attacking via ad hominem and failing to recognize, or conveniently ignoring, that one can simultaneously agree wholeheartedly with Sokal's motivesand intentions while appreciating and gaining valuable insight from incredibly interesting and well researched historical and relativistic cultural science studies is displayed throughout.<br /><br />In Lingua Franca's fabulous \\"The Sokal Hoax\\" it does a fine job of presenting all sides of the con on \\"Social Text,\\" a hoax that washed over all sorts of disciplines, ranging from philosophy, sociology, history, political science, the hard sciences, cultural studies and literary theory; all were touched in some fashion and all had respective intellectuals comment on the controversy.  Lingua Franca gathers them together and addresses every facet of Sokal's outrageous treatise that left \\"Social Text\\" marching down the avenue with no clothes on.  The two best pieces are by Paul Boghossian and Meera Nanda.  Boghossian's essay is a marvelous display of a brilliant philosophical mind at work.  He painstakingly lays out how and why Sokal's critics are misguided and how and why the folks who practice the extreme form of poststructuralist relativism fall short.  Nanda's piece is remarkable in that it addresses how some religious fanatics in developing countries are expropriating the rhetoric and questionable logic of the targets of Sokal's \\"Transgressing the Boundaries\\" and using it as cover to meld much of their religious superstition into reactionary public policy.  Definitely the worst essay of the bunch belongs to George Will who takes it as an opportunity to set up a straw man to lambaste the entire political left.<br /><br />Lingua Franca's \\"Sokal Hoax\\" will be an insightful book for anyone who is mildly interested in any of the vast academic disciplines it no doubt left its mark on.	2005-05-23

Gelbspan even presents a plausible plan to deal with global climate change.  Formulated in 1998 at Harvard, The World Energy Modernization Plan details a systematic process for making the required 70% cuts in oil and coal usage in order to stem the permanency of global warming.  It involves jettisoning the Kyoto provisions in favor of the more stringent Fossil Fuel Efficiency Standard, while shifting the fossil fuel industry's billions of dollars in subsidies to programs that develop clean energy.<br /><br />Those laughingstocks of the scientific community, the \\"greenhouse skeptics\\" (the folks the rightwing propaganda machine loves to quote and bounce around their GOP echo chamber ad nauseam), are touched on by Gelbspan and shown to be nothing more than clever shills for one of the most powerful and richest industries on earth.<br /><br />The fossil fuel lobby keeps the \\"skeptics\\" in their back pockets always ready to shuffle out on cue to confuse the public with their disinformation campaign aimed at proving the global warming phenomenon's a hoax.  Their mercurial goal being to inculcate in the public consciousness the notion global climate change is only \\"theory\\" rather than what it truly is: a well proven scientific fact.<br /><br />The fossil fuel industry espouses their nonsense even though the fact of human induced global warming has been firmly substantiated in the most rigorously peer-reviewed scientific study in history.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, NOAA and National Academy of Science all concur that if CO2 emissions are not drastically cut, environmental harm may result.  Gelbspan further points out that \\"Science\\" magazine is advocating, with Manhattan Project urgency, the development of wind, solar and hydrogen fuel.<br /><br />Boiling Point is at its best when broaching the mainstream media (of course corporate owned) role in perpetuating public ignorance.  The concept of journalistic balance leads to warped and biased coverage of global climate change.  Providing \\"skeptics\\" equal time with the scientific community is akin to granting equal time to crackpots who believe 2+2=3.  Gelbspan astutely notes that when questions of fact are at issue journalistic balance is absurd.<br /><br />At a time when George Bush (the dry drunk, Jesus freak, draft dodging, warmongering, dithering dolt president of the United States) stakes out a position on global warming that alienates and flies in the face of the international community and the scientific method; Gelbspan has delivered a terrifying yet essential work that's a direct call to arms for anyone who values environmental protection ahead of the profit margins of ExxonMobil, the Peabody Group and BP Amoco.	2004-12-30

Hirst's book is an invaluable contribution to an area of study too often deliberately muddied and confused by Israeli apologists intent on obfuscation. He presents an honest, scholarly look into the Middle East conflict beginning when Jews essentially started to migrate to Palestine during the late 19th Century.<br /><br />This latest updated edition covers events through the recent Palestinian Intifada and the 2001 September 11th attacks against the United States.  Hirst does a fabulous job in demolishing three often heard myths:<br />Myth number 1.) Palestine was 'a land without a people, waiting for a people without a land.'<br />Myth number 2.) Palestinians fled their country on the orders of Arab leaders.<br />Myth number 3.) Jewish soldiers committed no willful attrocities.<br /><br />Of course Palestinians fled because of the deliberate terror, violence and massacres perpetrated against them by Jewish militias (Irgun, Stern). In fact Herzl, one of Israel's founding fathers, openly admitted that immigration (Jewish) into an already populated country (Palestine) would soon turn the natives against the newcomers. As Hirst points out: the proponents of a Jewish state were the original aggressors in the Middle East; Arab violence was an inevitable reaction to theirs.<br /><br />The Gun and the Olive Branch gives a poignant analysis of the 1948 War documenting how the Jewish community was never in danger of annihilation and that Israel was the true aggressor and instigator, both in 1948 and in the 1967 Six Day War, the remnants of which are obviously still being felt.<br /><br />Hirst fills the book with fascinating pieces of information detailing how Palestinian suicide bombings come in the service of what the world regards as a legitimate purpose - ending Israel's illegal occupation. Also he broaches the topic of Israel's nuclear weapons and how Noam Chomsky, in his excellent work The Fateful Triangle, argues that the real target of Israel's nuclear arsenal is the United States. It puts America in a 'do what we say and give us what we want, or else' quandary.<br /><br />This latest edition, put out by the publishing house of the fantastic Nation magazine, is updated giving the reader a glimpse into activities the Israeli soldiers are involved in currently. According to Hirst's incredibly well sourced book Israeli occupation authorities have been rampaging through Palestinian agencies of health, education or agriculture - destroying computers and important files, ransacking businesses and banks looting public buildings and defecating and urinating on floors, carpets, children's paintings, in drawers and flowerpots; and also of course they have busied themselves killing scores of innocent Palestinian civilians. This is the United States tax dollar at work given that America subsidizes Israel to the tune of approximately $4 billion annually!<br /><br />Hirst astutely points out that during this most recent Palestinian uprising - CBS, ABC, and NBC aired 99 reports covering Gaza and the West Bank, but in only four out of the 99 reports were viewers informed that Gaza and the West Bank are Israeli occupied territories. The Gun and the Olive Branch goes on to document how myriad journalists privately admit they fear the retribution of pro-Israeli publishers and editors and generally understand that critical words about Israel can be hazardous to careers.<br /><br />This is the definitive account of the entire history of the Israeli Palestinian conflict and is arguably one of the most crucial non-fiction books of the last 60 years. It should be studied by every American citizen since only the United States can save the Zionists from themselves. Given the potentially cataclysmic consequences a knowledgeable citizenry may be our only hope. Hirst's marvelous book goes as far as possible in advancing this cause.	2004-06-07

Of course this applies equally as well to all other religious faiths.<br /><br />The magnificent intellectual Bertrand Russell more than meets the task of unmasking superstitious nonsense such as a belief in God and an afterlife in this classic work, which should be required reading for all those who wake up early each Sunday and proudly trudge off to one or another house of worship.  Free-thinkers should be rejoicing that over the last few decades church attendance has been in a steady decline.  That these most successful cults in world history have suffering membership rates is cause for celebration.<br /><br />Russell points out that most people believe in God simply because they have been taught from infancy to do so.  Moreover during troubling times a spiritual belief gives them the reassuring feeling of an older brother type of figure watching over them.  It is emotional rather than scientific reasons that lead people to make this leap of faith.  Often one wonders why these dutiful Christians hold \\"Jesus\\" in such high regard given some of his more sadistic views.  Why I am Not a Christian is loaded with insightful quotes from Jesus demonstrating his more sadistic side such as everlasting punishment and turning family members against one another.<br /><br />Russell demolishes the well worn First-cause argument by logically reducing it to the question of 'Who made God?'  He points out the leap of faith involved when someone believes in God.  It is clearly a question that lies outside the realm of probable knowledge where there is as much a likelihood the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy exist as a God or afterlife.  As the late Carl Sagan wrote: 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.'  Russell goes on to discuss simple biological reasons for rejecting a belief in an afterlife.  Since what constitutes a personis a series of experiences connected by memory, and the brain is rendered useless at death (obviously memory along with it), it is preposterous to assume a human survives death and enters a \\"heaven\\" or \\"hell.\\"<br /><br />During the first three centuries of the Christian era individuals were powerless to have an effect on the politico-economic environment under which they lived.  Why I am Not a Christian accurately remarks that this is primarily why much of Christian doctrine is largely obsessed with making an individual perfect in an imperfect world and that the good life has little to do with external social conditions and everything to do with a warped view of inner personal piety (especially dealing with sexual matters).  It should be noted that for centuries the church opposed the abolition of slavery.  The only reason some contemporary Christians still do not adhere to some of their more outlandish tenets is due to the debt they owe to the generations of rationalists, humanists and free-thinkers who from the Renaissance to the present day have caused religionists to become embarrassed over some of their more ridiculous traditional beliefs.  Russell mentions that cruelty in society has almost always ran in direct correlation with the amount of dogmatic religious belief.  All one has to do is study the Inquisition and Puritan New England to realize the plethora of women burned as witches to come to this rather pragmatic conclusion.<br /><br />Perhaps one of Christianity's most pernicious effects on the world is its war against knowledge.  Because knowledge can be a force to bring about universal happiness - religion is a chief impediment to realizing this goal.<br /><br />Why I am Not a Christian is an absolutely outstanding work that some day may be more widely read.  It is an obvious classic for intelligent people who adhere to a scientific outlook.  Hopefully as the culture of the United States slowly evolves out of what can accurately be described as almost apre-Enlightenment society, a great thinker of Russell's stature will be given his proper due.  In a nation where Pascal's Wager keeps a large amount of religious worshipers in tow, and where a substantial percentage of the population has a literal belief in the \\"Devil,\\" it cannot happen soon enough.	2004-04-19

Released in the mid-1980s, 'The Rip-Off Book' still holds up by giving a detailed glimpse into those manipulative fraudsters many of us have had the pleasure of dealing with for at least a few moments in our lives.<br /><br />Santoro gears the book toward the typical scams and rip-offs perpetrated against working people and small businesses.  He points out how the standard con man is typically an intelligent fellow who looks quite presentable and definitely fits no preconceived notion of what a fraud artist may look like.  A plethora of scams are unveiled, such as the envelope switch, three-card monte, the inspector ploy, the bank examiner swindle, the sheet writer scam, and myriad others.  Santoro has a knack for laying these frauds out and explaining them in an insightful manner.  At one point he discusses high pressure sales techniques some con men employ; he points out that they'll often act rude and try to make the victim look like a cretin, and even try and embarrass the victim if they don't sign on the dotted line.<br /><br />Included is an interesting chapter discussing the difference between phone scams and postal rip-offs.  He points out that generally phone companies could care less whether frauds are carried out via their lines, thus telephone frauds far out pace postal cons, since the postal service utilizes a healthy staff of postal inspectors versus the ambivalence shown by the phone companies.<br /><br />The Rip-Off Book is probably at its most informative when it delves into the difficulty of defining just what a fraud is.  Santoro demonstrates that often it can be a gray area, given that many cons are identified by law enforcement as civil rather than criminal matters.  A helpful final section looks at passive defensive techniques citizens can use to inoculate themselves from these manipulative scammers who prey on both the gullible and the savvy.<br /><br />Although a bit dated (having since been updated at least once or twice; updated versions of course include chapters on the burgeoning field of Internet scams) The Rip-Off Book is a classic work on street frauds, stuffed full of valuable information.  It holds up nicely and would certainly be helpful for anyone to peruse.

I got to like the big-hipped cat-faced women of the photographs shown as lures out in front of the burlesque show; the announcements of moving picture palaces bejeweled with paste-bright lights; the little music shops that had radios blasted into the street.&#34;  That's Wilson describing a slice of Manhattan during the Depression Era from his excellent novel, 'Princess With the Golden Hair,' which is 200 pages of brilliance.  Vivid and stylized descriptions of 1930s New York are sprinkled throughout what Wilson himself has remarked is his personal favorite of all his books.  'Memoirs of Hecate County' consists of six completely separate stories, five of which are moderately good at best, it's 'Princess With the Golden Hair' that carries the day.<br /><br />The dialogue between him and Imogen (the upperclass woman he's having an affair with) and him and Anna (the poor woman he's simultaneously scheduling assignations) is splendidly written.  At one point he remarks to Imogen that she's a beauty yet doesn't act like it.  Beauties, he explains, expect to be admired and courted.  She, the suburban philistine, at one point has enough honesty to remark that if he got to know her he wouldn't like her.  In another passage Anna concludes that poor people can't love their mothers the way other girls do because their mothers aren't able to look after them and physically abuse them.  It's this constant juxtaposition running the length of the book which makes for fascinating reading.  He jumps back and forth from Imogen to Anna -- two starkly different worlds in which he uncomfortably has a foot ensconced in each.  On another occasion he reflects to himself how Imogen's peers would react to the going-ons in Anna's world, the thought of their incredulous responses is almost comical yet tragic.<br /><br />With a deft hand Wilson incorporates into his novel such topics as classstratification and the unwritten and unseen barriers separating the well-to-do from the poor.  Towards the end he finally ventures to Anna's Brooklyn 'hood and is slapped in the face with what it truly means to be poor.  He later becomes convinced America's rich do indeed constitute a bourgeoisie, and that Anna's proletariat world is the base on which everything rests, including Imogen's superficial reality.  He concludes on a somber note lamenting how he will never have Anna again.<br /><br />Included in Memoirs is an afterword by Updike who makes two extremely pertinent points: 1.) It was Wilson's conscious intent to bring Euro sexual realism into American fiction for the first time, and 2.) Memoirs, specifically Princess With the Golden Hair, was at the time an intelligent attempt by an American male to dramatize sexual behavior as a function of personality.  Also included in the afterword is a quite interesting Q&A with intellectual heavyweight, Lionel Trilling, which took place during Memoirs' obscenity hearing.<br /><br />Princess With the Golden Hair works on a number of levels.  The cornerstone being that it contrasts two completely different worlds in the eyes of an intelligent critic.  Judging by Memoirs, Wilson's foray into literature is an easy success, and an insightful look into 1930's mores.	2004-01-21
US	37681893	RDUWLQRUDXL3H	097091010X	405863844	Days of War, Nights of Love: Crimethink For Beginners	Books	3	13	25	N	N	Flawed, yet fine critique of capitalism	'Days of War Nights of Love' is the definitive account of contemporary anarchist thought, it also contains a good deal of Luddite thought.  An extremely healthy anti police-state streak runs throughout the book and an outstanding chapter on political apostasy and hypocrisy is the highlight.  The section expounding on the justifications for shoplifting is outstanding.  Also, Days of War Nights of Love contains accurate and well thought out views against industrial capitalism and the consumerist tendency in modern society.<br /><br />However, Days of War Nights of Love is a flawed work for a few reasons.  For one, it contains a steady dose of anti-communist red bashing that is worthy of Orwell - a relentless red basher who's praised in the bibliography.  Given there has rarely, if ever, been a successful anarcho-syndicalist revolution, the book's characterization of the Russian revolution as a &#34;botched counterfeit&#34; is off base.  Despite all its mistakes, the majority populace were much better off regarding a plenitude of life indicators than they were under the czars.  Simply because a socialist society is imperfect does not mean that it is a botched counterfeit.  Children no longer dying of malnutrition can attest to that.  It often appears Days of War Nights of Love aims for an absolute uptopian society; for some it's this unattainable ideal that helps to retain a better-than-anything appeal.<br /><br />Regarding the ideal anarchist society, Days of War Nights of Love remarks, &#34;no one can imagine what it would be like let alone how to achieve it, not even the anarchists themselves.&#34;  The authors go on to state that their wild dream is going to work.  In a stunning failure of anarchist society, Days of War Nights of Love cites D'Annunzio's short lived revolution, which was made up of music, wine, poetry and fireworks.  Obviously it was swiftly defeated, virtually proving that many anarchists are in love with an unworkable ideal rather than a revolutionary society that can actually bring sustainable long-term benefits to the masses, such as in Cuba and the former Soviet Union.<br /><br />At one point Days of War Nights of Love remarks that all political activity must be joyous and exciting in itself.  This reminds one of when Emma Goldman misguidedly opined that she wanted no part of a revolution in which she could not dance in the streets.  Left out of this picture are the harsher realities a protest movement and a fledgling revolutionary society are up against.  One can be sure it is not joyous to be shot in the face with a rubber bullet by a fascist cop.  And one can be relatively certain that a newly formed revolutionary state is going to have to form a centralized state power to defend itself against internal sabotage and subversion, and external attacks and encirclement.  The Sandinista and Cuban revolutions would not have lasted two months if all they did was joyously dance in the streets.  Moreover, the Soviet Union never would have been able to withstand the Nazi onslaught if it were not for central planning that produced tanks, steel and wheat.  In addition, the Days of War Nights of Love crowd needs to understand that even in a post revolutionary society there is a good chance that there simply will not be enough creative work to go around for all those who consider themselves interesting and creative people.<br /><br />Another passage that is off the mark involves their view of how it is in everyone's interest that we do away with capitalism and that everyone suffers from today's status quo including the rich; they admonish the reader not to be too jealous of the rich.  This is a fairly juvenile position as it fails to consider the causal link between vast concentrations of wealth and widespread poverty.  It also fails to comprehend that every revolutionary state has been vehemently opposed by the affluent ruling class.  It is the former plutocrats who orchestrate the counterrevolutionary assassinations and village massacres.  There is nothing envious about pointing out the behavior of the owning class.<br /><br />All this being said, despite its faults Days of War Nights of Love should be read for its sound critique of modern industrial society in general and corporate capitalism in particular.	2003-12-10

Parenti is an eloquent Caesarian historian who displays an astonishing amount of research finely organized and presented in this Pulitzer Prize nominated work; which will no doubt have the Ciceronians scrambling to put together a rebuttal.<br /><br />The Assassination of Julius Caesar points out how numerous popularis fell victim to the optimates death squads, Tiberius Gracchus, Gaius Gracchus, Drusus, Clodius and Rufus all sealed their fates by taking up the populist cause.  Along with Caesar each of them lobbied and passed such policies as land reform, debt forgiveness, expansion of the franchise, giving the craft guilds more power, and greater food allotments.<br /><br />Parenti makes for especially fascinating reading when he documents the reign of Sulla; the fascist autocrat whose policies weren't rolled back until Caesar's First Triumvirate was able to abolish some his more regressive laws.  Also Dr. Parenti's sections on Cicero, the Machiavellian statesman who served autocratic interests, are sensational.  He exposes Cicero's fomenting of the witch-hunt like Cataline Conspiracy.  Egalitarian reforms and attempts to democratize decision making were treated as outright subversion by the optimates.  Cicero upheld these values by constantly propagandizing against Cataline and his tepid reforms.  We discover that Cicero was an odious creature who sold-out to power at every opportunity by often being quite an effective mouthpiece for the priveleged of ancient Rome.<br /><br />The Assassination of Julius Caesar shows how Caesar was not a revolutionary but rather a reformer who worked to break the stranglehold of the senatorial autocrats.  While not being perfect, Caesar dedicated himself to the popular cause and was well liked by the masses.  Unlike Cicero, Sulla, Brutus, Cassius andCato of whom none have flowers left at their graves like Caesar's tomb does to the present day.  Parenti documents how Caesar was committed to rolling back the worst class abuses perpetrated by the wealthy and was fondly remembered for it.<br /><br />One prevarication Parenti studiously attacks is Caesar's supposed burning of the Serapeum library in Alexandria.  It was the Christ worshippers in the fourth century who carried out the deed, Caesar and his forces burned not a single page.<br /><br />The assassination itself is portrayed in vivid detail, including a surprising and accurate quote from Major General Fuller's biography that sums up the entire affair: \\"the plotters were well aware that under Caesar their opportunities for financial gain and political power would vanish.\\"  Perhaps not vanish but greatly diminish would have been totally accurate.<br /><br />A consistent theme runs throughout the book and that is Parenti's analysis and evidence of the bias  many latter day gentlemen historians have against the \\"mob\\" or \\"rabble\\" and Caesar.  He notes that these historians pay little attention to how the optimates swindled land from small farmers, plundered the provinces like pirates, over taxed colonized people, rent gouged, and lifted not a finger towards debt relief.  It should be remembered that the common people had scant opportunity to leave a written record of their views and struggles.  In fact these people derisively referred to as the \\"criminal mob\\" and \\"rabble\\" by Cicero and some other present day historians were in actuality masons, carpenters, shopkeepers, scribes, butchers and other working class people.<br /><br />The Assassination of Julius Caesar is a major scholarly work and will surely be read and discussed for generations.  It is history and historical analysis of the highest order and should not be missed by anyone with an inkling of historical curiosity.	2003-12-02

He brings the same studious approach to this area of inquiry as he's done for the last 40 years regarding the international arena and linguistics.  Along with Michael Parenti's Democracy For the Few, it's simply some of the best work available on this pressing topic.<br /><br />Deindustrialization, increasing underemployment, rising poverty, the increasing gap between the super rich and middle class, and the business community's relentless assault on unions - Chomsky touches on all these issues.  He summarizes these developments by writing that the United States is showing the characteristics of a Third World country by becoming a two-tiered society.  That the child poverty rate in New York city is approaching forty percent is just one example of the many nuggets of information a reader can garner from Year 501.<br /><br />The majority of the book covers an incredible amount of ground pertaining to international politics and economics with particular emphasis on Latin America.  As always these passages shine with insight and brilliance while being backed up with rigorous documentation and research.  Colonization to neo-imperialism are broached along with the two rip off machines known as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.<br /><br />Since he's always refused to punk out to mainstream corporate opinion Chomsky's a somewhat cruel reminder to the orthodox pundits and intellectuals of what intellectual responsibility is truly about.  'The New Yorker' recently ran a hit piece against him; this of course demonstrates that he's still pontificating and writing truths the black-tie cocktail party set refuse to countenance.Year 501 follows in the tradition of a long line of Chomsky books that make the establishment apologists a bit uncomfortable.	2003-11-13

When in a bind simply pick up any one of their titles and one cannot go wrong.  It's imperative to read at least a few of their books at least once.<br /><br />Henwood's Wall Street blows the lid off high finance like few other works.  It's the definitive critical analysis (along with some of William Greider's books) of the high circles of wealthy investors.<br /><br />Throughout Wall Street it rips apart the Federal Reserve Board and exposes its gritty innards.  Henwood demonstrates that the Fed is an undemocratic institution that's obsessed with any hints of labor militancy, its biggest fear being wage inflation.<br /><br />The Monetary School is also dissected by Henwood, being exposed as the fraudulent theory it truly is (or clever ruling class ideology).  He points out that the Monetarists' ostensibly blamed the federal government for the Great Depression.  Of course this has the fascinating effect of letting capitalism completely off the hook.  The concepts of over productivity and income polarization, which were the defining characteristics of the 1920s, are rarely to be found in their school of thought.<br /><br />Constant pressure by Wall Street for ever higher stock prices is what spurred most of the downsizing during the last decade according to Henwood.  He smartly points out that this pressure for quick profit growth can often squelch research and development and investment projects which would benefit society.  Because shareholders may very well deem these projects irrelevant to short-term profit growth.<br /><br />Underlying Wall Street throughout Henwood continually pays homage to Karl Marx and some of his incredibly accurate predictions.  He also demolishes old shibboleths such as the well worn canard that higher wages automatically translate into reduced employment opportunities, or that rising stock prices always mean a rosy economic picture for the general population.  Wall Street proves that rising stock prices can often coincide with a poor economy for the masses.<br /><br />Henwood documents the fraudulent work done by professional money managers who'd be better off throwing darts at a dart board than using their investment \\"skills\\" when making investment decisions for clients.<br /><br />Some of the most important and informative sections deal with the rising consumer debt of the average American citizen.  Being leveraged to the hilt, the family unit has basically been turned into a player in a giant Ponzi scheme.  Capitalism in the United States desperately relies on credit-financed consumption to stay afloat.<br /><br />Most books dealing with such an overarching topic give a paltry and dissatisfying \\"What is to be Done\\" final chapter.  This isn't the case for Wall Street.  Henwood offers up many concrete and plausible solutions.  Finally at one point asserting that an authentic financial transformation must be made along with an attack on capitalist social power in general.	2003-08-25

Particular attention obviously should be directed towards Raskolnikov's wrestling with his own mind and ethical precepts. Most readers can assuredly relate to similar questions of value in their own lives.<br /><br />Homicide's never been analyzed in such depth from the perspective of the perpetrator who of course happens to be the protaganist. It's this angle that Dostoevsky takes particular advantage of and makes the book hard to put down.	2003-05-27

One marvels at its continued relevance into the 21st Century. Dewey, arguably America's greatest thinker, does an amazing job in sifting through the problems contemporary society faces when forming a polity.<br /><br />The point Public and Its Problems brings up on more than one occasion is the need for political and social policy to incorporate the scientific method of testing and retesting to generate better results. Dewey refers to this as an experimental social method and surely felt corporate capitalism had used up its testing time and that a new socio-economic system should be tried. Public and Its Problems talks about how policies and theories need to be constantly in flux and not rigidly adhered. The social sciences would then work to investigate and interpret the results of the testing process.<br /><br />One portion of the book gives a fascinating look at a puzzling quandary Dewey proffers: that being the contradiction of the French and American revolutions having a philosophy of individualism while being massive collective efforts. This section makes for some complicated reading but it's enthralling nonetheless because it touches on a fundamental political and philosophical question. It's in this chapter of the book where he goes on to pose one of the more audacious and profound points of political thought: the essential fallacy of the democratic creed being that it assumes free human beings can rule themselves. (He obviously does say democracy is a good thing given that it threw off a restrictive cloak.) Dewey goes on to elaborate on the point indicating that what's critically necessary is an improvement to the methods and conditions of debate and discussion. Public and Its Problems goes on to ostensibly say it's the corporate capitalist press that controls policy conduct by controlling public opinion. A most astute observation. Of course this opinion is of a public that hasn't found itself, Dewey asserts. He writes \\"the modern economic regime control present politics much as dynastic interests controlled those of two centuries ago. They effect thinking and desire.\\" Here he touches on false consciousness and monopolistic control over our culture and institutions and the insidious way they thwart the public from finding itself and rallying for its concerns.<br /><br />Most importantly, Public and Its Problems contends that the majority populace can indeed make wise decisions regarding our present day technocratic culture; the key is that they must have access to unbiased sources without a vested interest (commercial profit) in the issue. Only with a relatively independent conduit of information can the masses make informed decisions on complex subjects. Clearly Dewey would be quite dismayed to see the state of the mass media today, being wholly owned and controlled by big corporate conglomerates. He would no doubt find it nearly impossible for a public to make intelligent decisions when pseudo-fascists like Michael Savage, Joe Scarborough, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Bill O'Reilly, Pat Robertson, Laura Ingram, Rusty Humphries, Michael Reagan, G. Gordon Liddy, Ann Coulter (the proud daughter of a union buster), Mike Gallagher, Bob Grant and William Kristol; along with myriad centrist status quo apologists, set the agenda. In one paragraph of the book Dewey showed incredible foresight by remarking that society \\"seems to be approaching a state of government by hired promoters of opinion called publicity agents.\\" With current political discourse being dictated by PR firms it's obvious he was right on the mark eighty years ago when he made the prediction.<br /><br />Dewey comes back to an important question routinely throughout, that being what are the conditions that make the transformation possible for the \\"Great Society\\" to change into the \\"Great Community\\"? The Public and Its Problems does much to stimulate thought on this vital issue that still plagues contemporary society, especially in the United States when the state was able to wage a war on Iraq when virtually ninety percent of the world was against it!<br /><br />Dewey's book serves as a tremendous introduction to history's greatest pragmatic philosopher.	2003-04-17

Just ask the myriad brave souls mentioned in Findley's book who had the temerity to speak out against AIPAC and the ADL and paid a huge price with ruined careers and personal harassment.  In fact, posting a review of this type is done in trepidation after reading this scary and accurate fact filled account of many displays of belligerent and bizarre harassment of Middle East experts and truth tellers.<br /><br />Findley's They Dare to Speak Out is one of most important books on the inner workings of Capitol Hill and he does a fair job of presenting all sides of the issue, far from being anti-Semitic he peppers the book with fine quotes and examples of courageous and honorable Jews speaking out.<br /><br />The most depressing aspect of the book is the way some of these intimidators actually used the Holocaust to sway legislation and pressure law makers. Jewish victims of one of the largest slaughters known to mankind, being manipulated in this manner, is probably the most disturbing revelation. Moreover the chapter covering Israel's 1967 sneak attack against the USS Liberty is unbelievable in that it's a story many Americans are unfamiliar with. Findley points out that the ship was floating innocently in the Mediterranean with its U.S. flag fully visible when Israel decided to repeatedly bomb it and kill over thirty American servicemen who were busy sunbathing and relaxing.<br /><br />Any American who professes to understand politics, knows nothing until they read this incredible work.  After reading the book one will understand what it truly takes to speak out on the issue of Israeli lawlessness and brutality.<br /><br />A soon to be released documentary film, \\"Occupation101\\", which features commentary by Findley would be an excellent companion toThey Dare to Speak Out.	2003-03-18

It's a chronicle of the recent history of the classic red-light district that was as part of Americana as mom and apple pie. With stark detail, down to the exact addresses of various brothels, porn houses and other wild joints; it feels as if a walk down the old Forty Deuce and Eighth Avenue is taking place as the pages go by. A natural born writer, Friedman's eye for detail is amazing and he delivers the goods.<br /><br />During its height of splendid glory it was a neighborhood that fostered more orgasms than any other making it somewhat depressing that this cultural relic known as Times Square has now been hijacked by Disney, the big developers and large corporations. Friedman does a quality job in touching on the underlying politico-economic realities responsible for the destruction of one of the last places that refused to be gentrified.<br /><br />With a keen eye for the hilariously absurd and the interesting denizens populating the Square from roughly the mid 60s to the mid 80s, Friedman offers up funny and enthralling stories involving strippers, johns, swing clubbers, prostitutes, shoeshines, religious folks, kiosk workers, pornstars and others. One startling fact broached is that in the 1970s during a typical summer night it wasn't unusual to see a thousand old school style hookers plying their trade along Eighth Avenue. Today it's scarcely possible to imagine given the plethora of cops occupying America's cities.<br /><br />Certainly the most indelible section of Tales of Times Square has to be the description of the famous -- or infamous depending on a person's predilections -- east coast swing club Plato's Retreat. The wild shenanigans documented are simply unbelievable. These chapters are worth the price of the book alone, although some may feel a shower's in order after reading some of this stuff.<br /><br />The last bastion of a truly honky-tonk atmosphere is over. As Friedman points out it's time to make way for Mickey and Minnie Mouse. In an age of sterile corporate strip malls, Tales of Times Square is a reminder that in at least one neighborhood things used to be quite different.	2003-03-15

The exciting and neglected story of working people and their struggles for humane conditions and a living wage is vividly documented in this outstanding work. Any book that starts out with this gem of a Lincoln quote: &#34;Outside the family, the strongest bond of human sympathy should be one uniting all working people of all nations, tongues and kindreds&#34; is certain to be wonderful.<br /><br />It does a fantastic job in documenting myriad instances of police violence towards striking and locked-out workers. Beginning with the historic Haymarket affair in Chicago where cops instigated a riot during a worker's demonstration and wound up jailing early heroes of the American labor movement who were eventually executed on trumped up charges; Labor's Untold Story goes on to explain the role of the International Workers of the World and Big Bill Haywood, all women and men worthy of emulation. Their struggle for simple free speech rights is told and the Wobblies and Eugene Debs are chronicled in vivid detail. Boyer and Morais put together a sensational description of the Great Depression explaining the causes such as over production combined with poor wages for the masses, and the everyday conditions for the working populace.<br /><br />Probably the finest chapter deals with the Flint Sit-Down strike of the 1930s. The impetus for the debilitating yet exhilarating strike being the speed-ups dictated by management which literally led to death for many workers as they slumped over the production lines in exhaustion. Another interesting fact pointed out in Labor's Untold Story is the National Association of Manufacturers admiration for Hitler. NAM, that reactionary group of rightwing business boyz, certainly did have some fascistic tendencies in common with Nazism according to Boyer andMorais. Lastly the rise of the more radical and worker friendly CIO is documented with a keen eye for detail and the Taft-Hartley Act, which essentially destroyed labor rights in the United States, is explained including the fact that it was virtually written by the business men who had been screaming like spoiled toddlers for its implementation since the Wagner Act.<br /><br />Labor's Untold Story is a welcome history book, one stocked full of fascinating stories that every American worker should have some familiarity with. It's the definitive account of what got American workers the modicum of working benefits many of them now take for granted. Much of this book should have been turned into a wonderful film years ago, but of course corporate owned studios generally stay as far away as possible from true labor history.  That's not to discount the few independent studios that have put together fine films about some of these topics on shoestring budget.<br /><br />It should be noted that this book recently came out in a new edition, the cover art portrays an intriguing historical photo documenting a gang of cops beating a single worker.	2003-02-16

Being accused of running death camps (which was a fraudulent charge), and perpetrating a systematic policy of mass rape and mass murder, the idea the Serbs were little more than monsters was inculcated into the minds of citizens throughout the entire industrialized world. In this incredible dissection of the Yugoslavian conflict, Parenti proves the corporate capitalist press (NY Times, AP, Washinton Post, BBC, major TV networks, etc.) rarely wavered in their goal of demonizing the Serbs while virtually ignoring atrocities committed by the pseudo-fascist Croatian forces and Bosnian Muslim forces. As To Kill a Nation points out, Croatian forces massacred Serb civilians fleeing for their lives into Bosnia. At the time Croatia was headed by that minimizer of the Jewish Holocaust: Tudjman - a strong ally of the United States.<br /><br />Parenti makes it clear the reason Milosevic and the Serbs were and are the targets for demonization is because they were the most resolute against allowing the FRY to be laid open and exploited by international investors, and the IMF and World Bank.<br /><br />To Kill a Nation unearths fascinating sources pointing out the integral role western intelligence agencies played in financing the secessionist organizations during the 90s - obviously this would work to destabilize the successful mixed socialist economy of Yugoslavia. Wanting to institute free-market reforms, which have wrought misery and ruined lives throughout Eastern Europe over the past decade, the western powers hit on the concept of destabilization in order to do away with the solidarity felt by much of the FRY population.<br /><br />The key quotes and sources Parenti displays are nothing short of amazing and astounding. During the siege of Sarajevo, which turned much of global opinion against the Serbs, he demonstrates that it was the Bosnian Muslim forces that consistently started the daily bombings and disallowed safe passage to civilians. There's even documentation of Bosnian Muslim snipers secretly firing on citizens in order to lay the blame on Serb forces. The highly touted \\"genocide\\" stories at Srebrenica and Trepca are touched on and quickly proven to be a western orchestrated propaganda campaign designed by the west to foster global enmity towards the Serbs.  Srebrenica was a home base for the anti-Serb forces who carried out countless human rights violations against Serb civilians.  The only way the Serb forces could control the town was through military force (when facing a well financed and bloodthirsty opponent it's virtually impossible to stick to idealistic notions of non-violence).  Evidently winning a battle is considered genocide when it's the wrong side that wins the battle.<br /><br />When To Kill a Nation turns its sights to NATO's alliance with the organized mobsters, drug dealers and gun runners of the Kosovo Liberation Army, it delves into a rarely analyzed area of world affairs. Parenti astutely broaches the topic of the myriad laws broken when NATO bombed the infrastructure, social capital and political quarters of Yugoslavia. NATO's obliteration of the FRY's socialist economy served a rational class interest for western ruling elites and investors. To Kill a Nation mentions the sad fact that many well minded liberal intellectuals were suckered into jumping on the Serb and Milosevic demonization train and some even countenanced the bombing.<br /><br />Parenti documents that most of the human rights abuses attributed to the Serbs were committed primarily by the Chetnik paramilitaries who often acted outside the control of top military brass. Some analysts claim the paramilitaries task was not easy due to the difficulty in distinguishing the enemy. To Kill a Nation does a masterful job in pointing out the biases and difficulties faced by the Serbs and anyone else in the FRY determined to keep democratic socialism intact.  In fact it's crucial to remember Milosevic was elected in a fair and open contest.<br /><br />Parenti's book is one of the finest works on international politics and economics. Written in a direct and engaging style, To Kill a Nation is one of Verso Publishing's best offerings to date.	2003-01-25

She's definitely hit on something and her conclusions seem to be right on the mark. To boil down the six-hundred odd pages into a succinct conclusion: Faludi combines bad dads, the U.S. culture of superficial consumerism, and of course the diminishing amount of well paying, unionized blue-collar jobs, to prove that many American men have been getting kicked in the teeth over the last four decades.<br /><br />Faludi does a tremendous amount of leg work in interviewing everyone from male porn studs and ghetto gangsters to midwest gun huggers and fanatical football fans. The most jaw-dropping chapter is her analysis of the bullying and hazing that goes on at the Citadel. Here is a bunch of macho superpatriots who have bought into the American dream their entire lives, yet when they graduate they'll have a good chance of serving drinks at Orange Julius (through no fault of their own and much like college grads everywhere).  She does a masterful job of dissecting the after effects of the My Lai massacre, specifically how American life has treated both Lt. Calley and the heroic whistleblower.  Faludi documents all sorts of bizzare behavior on behalf of virtually the entire My Lai platoon.<br /><br />Stiffed is almost seven hundred pages and contains loads of information, but because it's so interesting and well written, and includes the unique dynamic of having a feminist intellectual lending her talents to the plight of the American man, it's quite an enthralling and fascinating read. I left this book thinking that Faludi's really tied it all together and has come up with a coherent, holistic and accurate picture of what's actually been going on. Stiffed is an excellent addition to Faludi's library which contains the already classic Backlash.  If you've read either one, than you owe it to yourself to read the other.	2003-01-12

Easily being the world's most recognizable athlete since Ali and Pele, he was clearly as much a jumpshooter as a marketing phenomenon. There's a reason sneakers bearing his name still line store shelves.<br /><br />&#34;The Jordan Rules&#34; gets beyond the carefully honed image and presents Jordan as another superstar player (arguably the best ever, although the Big O with all his triple doubles could make a convincing case) who can be both generous and backstabbing towards his teammates and coaches.<br /><br />His relationship with his brilliant head coach, Phil Jackson, makes for some of the most interesting reading and Smith brings a lot of the fascinating details to the table. Catching Jordan's ultra-competitive nature throughout, Smith wrote the type of book sports fans can truly appreciate for its candid look into the locker room. From the comradery to the petty squabbles, &#34;The Jordan Rules&#34; is a terrific read, as are most controversial sports books that tell the truth.	2002-12-03

This book is essentially more of the Republican Party snake oil in a quasi-academic guise in order to cloak it with an air of respectability.<br />Sykes and his ilk work tirelessly to narrow the spectrum of political debate even further to a debate between their right-wing (the term &#34;conservative&#34; is too inaccurate to describe them, although they misidentify themselves with it all the time, a true Edmund Burke philosophical conservative would be rolling over in his grave) brethren and the centrist sellout DLC type Democrats. Sykes' book carries on about &#34;victimization&#34; which isn't too far off the mark given that listeners are certainly victimized when they call into his radio show to point out the errors of his reactionary thinking only to be browbeaten and hung-up on in a jackbooted style.  Of course he usually than liberal baits and race baits anyone opposed to his positions.<br /><br />Sykes bemoans the so called power wielded by liberals while &#34;A Nation of Victims&#34; has a huge pre-packaged audience ready to drop their hard earned cash on it. If Sykes and his dittoheads ever get everything they desire by way of public policy one shudders to think what the U.S. will look like. Although it's not too difficult to imagine: like any third world nation, what one will find will be an America reduced to the way it was in the nineteenth century, consisting of a tiny rich elite, small middle class and huge impoverished mass. &#34;A Nation of Victims&#34; and its fans work to make this a reality.

Said, living proof as himself is one of the half million Palestinians forcibly transferred in the late 1940s, quite simply speaks the truth in this fantastic, informative and sorrowful collection of essays, which originally appeared over the course of seven years in various Middle East news outlets.<br /><br />His flair for language and the crystal clear prose make his essays seemingly flow off the page and are a joy to read.  \\"Peace and Its Discontents\\" is a welcome counterpunch, especially for an American audience fed a steady supply of Israeli and United States propaganda and deceit that whitewashes Israel's flaunting of international law and its consistent violation of a resilient and proud peoples human rights.<br /><br />That someone becomes so filled with hopelessness and despair to strap a bomb to themselves to wipe out a group of innocents is something that's clearly outside the conceptual framework of any relatively comfortable human being.  In \\"Peace and Its Discontents\\" Said, while never justifying these acts, presents them in the correct historical, economic and political context in order to allow the reader a better grasp of the motivations that lie beneath them.<br /><br />For a quality primer on the Palestinian plight one can think of no better book.

I can think of no other person in the last century who epitomizes the role and purpose of the astute public intellectual.  A hero in more ways than one, Russell spoke up for peace and justice and paid a price -- being jailed along with, to this day, not getting his due respect; there's simply no reason he shouldn't be mentioned in the same breath as Einstein, the only reason he's not lies in the fact that he chose to take more of a principled stand on controversial issues, i.e., war and nuclear power, the rapacious nature of capitalism, human sexuality and women's rights.<br /><br />History of Western Philosophy easily stands as the definitive one volume work on the broad subject of philosophy.  Russell covers an enormous amount of material including the standard epistomological, aesthetic, logic, ethic and metaphysical questions.  He spares no punches and really undresses the dogmatists for any sane reader to see.  Nietzsche comes under especially harsh justified criticism.  As does the ridiculous nostrums of the Catholic church and religious superstition in general.<br /><br />More than just a straight up philosophical work, History of Western Philosophy is an outstanding history book.  Russell boils down the complicated issues of the past and rolls them out in neatly digestable essays.  This one should stay on your bookshelf forever in that you'll find yourself reaching for it when historical and philosophical allusions come up in other great works of literature and film.<br /><br />Reading Russell is truly one of the more intellectually stimulating and enjoyable acts.  His breadth of knowledge is astounding and his writing style is witty and accessible.  No educated person can afford to neglect this great work.	2002-08-20

The dirty truth about standardized testing is that there's a high correlation between students' scores and their parents' income.  The wealthier the household a child grows up in the higher the scores they will receive on standardized tests.  This has been true for the Law School Admissions Test for decades.  It's these kinds of nuggets of wisdom one takes away from Gould's masterpiece.<br /><br />The most gratifying aspect of the book is the manner in which he frames it within the socio-political realities of the day.  In regards to the recent popularity of Hernstein's views (I single out Hernstein as he's the godfather of the field, Murray being more of an opportunistic tag along), Gould reminds the reader that it would not have garnered so much respectful mainstream attention if it were not for the regressive social policies Gingrich and other semi-fascist politicians were attempting to dress up and pass as law.<br /><br />More than just a popular science book on intelligence testing, The Mismeasure of Man covers a vast array of historical and sociological ground.  Gould peppers the book with stunning examples of tests that were shoved into the faces of freshly arrived immigrants to Ellis Island at the turn of the century and gives a brief overview of the historical attempts at testing the intelligence of different races and ethnicities; the crudity of these examples makes the book a classic by itself.<br /><br />It is a genuine tragedy that we recently lost this treasure.  It's one less arsenal in combating spurious scholarship in all its protean guises.	2002-08-13

In her and her sheep's view environmental protections, progressive taxation, labor standards and consumer rights are anathema to the workings of the free flowing market. Someone would think the horror stories of the 19th Century would have awoken her and her clones' minds to the rapacious nature of unfettered corporate power. Certainly the recent behavior of ImClone, Enron, Andersen, WorldCom, etc., must have shook the nonsense out of a few disciples; although if the S&L crisis, Boesky, Milken and BCCI shenanigans of the 1980s didn't do it probably nothing will.<br /><br />And of course the runaway of strong union jobs to the Sun Belt and Latin America is simply considered the wonderful machinations of capitalism. Sometimes a healthy dose of pragmatism is no match for committed disciples of balderdash. Clearly one can see that Rand's snake-oil ostensibly laid the foundation for the Republican Party's eventual platform.<br /><br />Pseudo intellectualism at its finest, to dare criticize the dime store wisdom in Atlas Shrugged will bring forth the wrath of her cultists of which Alan Greenspan is a member. The guy who tweaks interest rates in order to keep the bond traders happy and a solid chunk of Americans unemployed. One can thank Ayn Rand for bringing misery to myriad citizens and for perverting the definition of objectivity. I'm sure Nietzsche would approve.	2002-08-08

Perhaps its audience during its initial release (if I remember correctly it was published in the late forties or early fifties) could relate to and appreciate the stuffy character presented.<br /><br />Being a gullible Generation Xer I simply had no frame of reference in order to even have some sort of sympathy for the story or the middle-aged dude profiled therein.  I was definitely not aided in getting any by Percy.	2002-08-02
US	37681893	R22BO6I7HH041P	0231101570	611401852	World Orders Old and New	Books	5	26	28	N	N	Authoritative work on U.S. imperialism	Aside from virtually predicting the Colombian and Middle East conflicts the United States currently finds itself embroiled, Chomsky's World Orders Old and New offers a vast array of scholarly documentation to prove his overriding and stunningly accurate thesis: American foreign policy is embarked upon for the benefit of the transnational corporations and wealthy Wall Street investors.  The State Department, Pentagon, CIA and corporate owned media are their tools and propaganda apparatus to dominate the world's land, labor and resources.<br /><br />The naivete of Chomsky's critics simply astounds one. It's as if they do not want to believe or acknowledge the pink elephant that's in the room. For some it seems they simply refuse to disbelieve the ridiculous fairy tales they were taught in middle school and by rightwing radio about the well intentioned United States government and its interventions abroad.<br /><br />World Orders Old and New is a fantastic work that's filled with obscure references to sensational sources along with references from mainstream sources that are often buried beneath the stories about Clinton's sex life and O.J.'s homicidal rampage. Moreover, Chomsky fills the book with quotes from our leaders that are hard to believe but impossible to ignore. Chomsky digs deep and unearths the quotes from old State Department flacks, which will leave you awed in there audacity.<br /><br />In World Orders Old and New, Chomsky also touches upon the economic trends that have befallen 70% of the American domestic workforce. Primarily the fact that the Fortune 500 and unfair labor laws (dramatically favoring management) have assaulted American workers, drastically reducing their power to effectively organize strong unions. He accurately points out that wages for the typical U.S. worker have been on a steady decline since the early 1970s and that the primary cause for this has been the business world's virtual destruction of unions -- the one avenue in which working people can have a say in their livelihoods and a voice at the bargaining table.<br /><br />The last chapter gives a detailed analysis of the Israeli Palestinian conflict.  Actually as Chomsky demonstrates, that's somewhat of an inaccurate way to label the Mideast conflict.  As World Orders Old and New so accurately points out, it should be considered the Israeli lawlessness and brutality campaign backed by billions of dollars in U.S. military and economic aid.  Chomsky simply gives one the proof that Israel can get away with committing just about any human rights violation while at most the U.S. media will critize the Zionist state in the most tepid way possible.<br /><br />If one has never read Noam Chomsky they should do themselves a favor and pick up World Orders Old and New, it will help them understand why much of the international community holds the U.S. in contempt. Citizens of the U.S. deserve better than what their current leaders are giving them. Chomsky's book will go a long way in helping others recognize the pink elephant sitting in the room. As an internationally revered linguistic philosopher who has dedicated himself to justice, it appears Dr. Chomsky would have it no other way.	2002-07-27

It packs a heck of a punch by basically chronicling in great detail, the partying and good times that were had by the 1970s Dallas Cowboys.<br /><br />The drugs, booze, women and carousing are all here in abundance. Of course Henderson's athletic life is the focal point, however I found the behind the scenes stuff enthralling and worth the price of the book alone. Much in the tradition of Bouton's Ball Four, Out of Control takes it to another level.<br /><br />The usefulness of Out of Control is in its brutal honesty and fly-on-the-wall glimpse into big time sports. Anyone who has played any level of competitive football will find Out of Control to be a magnificent read you won't be able to put down. I devoured the whole thing in two days. Henderson's assertion of covert racism regarding just who would start at linebacker was also interesting and made for fascinating reading.<br /><br />The NFL's Public Relations department won't be sponsoring Henderson's book signing tour anytime soon.	2002-07-21

However, A Piece of My Mind is the definitive starting point in order to get a full grasp of Wilson's thoughts and opinions on everything from literature and communism to religion and evolution.  He even throws in a revealing chapter about his parents and their sometimes strained relationship, complete with emotional and mental breakdowns.<br /><br />Obviously Wilson is one of the greatest thinkers of the last century and A Piece of My Mind clearly demonstrates his talents and breadth of knowledge.  It should be required reading for those with inquisitive minds who have the need to get to the bottom of everything, much like Wilson himself.  A renaissance man in the truest sense of the word, one can't go wrong in reading Wilson; for a brilliant scholar his writing is refreshingly jargon free and relatively straight forward.	2002-07-21

Ranging from Lucky Luciano and his vicious control of the New York City dockworkers to Barry Seal (the portly narcotics pilot who ended up being gunned down in the late 1980s when it appeared he was going to implicate the CIA and upper federal government conspirators in cocaine smuggling) and \\"Freeway\\" Ricky Ross, Whiteout succinctly organizes and presents all the stories pertaining to U.S. intelligence and national security state operatives cultivating and often dealing in heroin and cocaine trafficking.<br /><br />Cockburn and St. Claire throw an array of sleazy characters into the mix which makes it read in parts like good fiction as opposed to actual American history, of course much of it hidden history.<br /><br />The finest and most astounding chapter deals with the mainstream press and their treatment of Gary Webb -- the heroic journalist who broke the initial story of CIA complicity in introducing crack cocaine into the California underworld in the early 1980s -- and their reaction and damage control attempts towards his explosive story.  So called \\"black paranoia\\" is also touched on in this section, specifically the way in which the corporate owned media labeled angry blacks as being irrationally paranoid for correctly being up in arms over Webb's startling tale.<br /><br />All of this is presented in more of structural analysis and academic style, as opposed to a conspiratorial spin, with a myriad of sources to back up and document every assertion.  For those naive enough to believe organized crime doesn't exist anymore, all they need to do is read Cockburn and St. Clair's Whiteout to realize it's thriving and sometimes reaches into the highest areas of the Executive branch.  Truly frightening stuff.  You'll leave the book hoping retribution eventually catches up with all those involved in profiting from the decimation of once relatively vibrant communities.	2002-07-20

For this was probably the worst drivel I've ever attempted to read, and I gave it my all -- sans Cliff Notes.  But alas, I too shucked aside this chunk of [garbage] after a hundred or so pages of what felt like a bad case of athlete's foot (just as a previous reviewer did).<br /><br />This is the exact kind of novel that, when introduced to young readers, turns them off to classic literature altogether.  Every time I finished a page it felt like I was spitting into the wind. I guess I must be missing something, perhaps I lack some sort of cognitive gene because this was as incomprehensible as your stoner buddy trying to figure out how to hook up the Play Station.  I didn't know if I was reading great literature or a backwards Wendy's menu.<br /><br />If you like to enjoy a narrative structure that has any semblance of coherence, don't waste your time with Sound and the Fury when there's so much Hemingway, Salinger, Dostoyevsky (quality English translations), Fitzgerald, Nabokov, James and Steinbeck out there to stimulate and grab you.  Of course if you're a masochist, Faulkner's your man.<br /><br />I know, I know, I'm failing to appreciate a work of literary genius, etc. etc.  The problem with this criticism is most people need paragraphs and passages to at least make a little bit of sense. Or perhaps maybe it's like staring at a Jackson Pollack -- you're just not supposed to understand anything about it, just appreciate its beauty.<br /><br />Label me a philistine if you wish, I still contend Sound and the Fury [disappoints].	2002-07-19

Finkelstein has done his homework and displays facts and figures many mainstream Jewish organizations take pains to keep out of the New York Times.  Anyone reading this book with an eye for objectivity will walk away much more enlightened.<br /><br />After reading this I can't help but feel that the Holocaust Industry (Finkelstein's term for the shakedown) is cheapening the memory of all the victims of World War II fascism.  As Finkelstein notes, the H.I. has handed anti-semites tantalizing tidbits of ammunition.  Hopefully this extortion racket will eventually be exposed in the establishment media, however I'm not holding my breath.  Finkelstein has done a tremendous service to the public with this cogent and scholarly critique.<br /><br />Ignore the rantings of those who will accuse you of being anti-semitic, and read this book.	2002-07-17

Urban decay and the rough times of just getting by are incredibly documented in this fantastic novel. It will make you laugh and cry at the same time. I know that sounds cliche but it's more true with this book than most others. Every story chronicled resonates with a gritty street authenticity I've yet to see duplicated in any other novel, except for perhaps Richard Price's \\"Clockers.\\"<br /><br />The Modern Library recently came out with their opinion of the top 100 fiction works of the last century; the crime of the century was their complete exclusion of Last Exit to Brooklyn. It's surely the most underrated book I've yet to come across. That could be because it tells a story about the American nightmare which too many people choose to ignore.<br /><br />Read this one. It's the kind of book you can't get off your mind for days after you've finished.	2002-07-17

The new American prison boom is dealt with by Parenti along with a myriad of other criminal justice issues.<br /><br />As mentioned above, the most accurate and satisfying aspect of the book is the manner in which it intelligently ties a politico-economic critique into its analysis of criminal justice (sic).<br /><br />Go beyond nonsense television programs that purport to deal with crime and society, by devouring Parenti's book.	2002-07-17
US	37681893	R2TB6LDDFM00TC	0684803356	896923	For Whom the Bell Tolls	Books	5	5	6	N	N	Wish I could give it 6 stars	Robert Jordan is one of the most exciting, interesting and principled fictional characters I've ever had the pleasure to read about.  Set during the fascist take over in 1930s Spain, For Whom the Bell Tolls is a novel that will easily stand the test of time (not much of a prediction since it was written in 1940) and is one of the finest books in the English language.  Jordan, an American, is the main character who comes to Europe to fight the good fight against Franco's military thugs.  The reader is given a fascinating in-depth look into his psyche, where he reflects on his fellow soldiers, plans for warmaking and the justifications and rationalizations along the war trail.<br /><br />Pablo's another character who is burned into your consciousness long after you've finished reading.  A fellow rebel (they weren't rebels in the true sense, since they were fighting for a government they had duly elected; however, they have all the characteristics of guerrillas in that the Spanish military waged an immediate and violent war against that very democratically elected government), the reader is left wondering just how committed he is to the cause.  There is an incredible flashback story detailing Pablo's orchestration of the sadistic torture and humiliation of a group of wealthy fascist sympathizers.  The vivid description involved in this passage is nothing short of extraordinary.<br /><br />Of course the true democrats, fighting for the Republic against the well financed and better armed fascist military, eventually lose the war, but having that foreknowledge does nothing to detract from the cliff-hanger like feelings brought about by the various battles and journeys the rebel crew embarks on.<br /><br />This is the best, and most accessible of all of Hemingway's works.  If someone is interested in reading Hemingway, For Whom the Bell Tolls is the perfect starting point.  As for Hemingway's style of prose, what more can be said, except that it's brilliant, enthralling and readily accessible to the common reader, unlike Joyce and Faulkner.  In my opinion, every American should give some time to Hemingway's For Whom the Bell Tolls.  Commitment, intelligence, sacrifice and fighting for the well being of your fellow man is all there along with a terrific love story. Given that the average American attention span is like a ferret on a double espresso (Dennis Miller), very few will give books like For Whom the Bell Tolls a try with the mass of pop TV garbage out there.<br /><br />An excellent companion to the book is the documentary film \\"The Good Fight\\" narrated by Studs Terkel.  It gives a mini history lesson of the Spanish Civil War and specifically focuses on a group of U.S. citizens (the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) who heroically went abroad and fought along side the democrats against Franco and his fascist military thugs.	2002-07-16

Of course die-hard Catholics are going to be apoplectic over this book, as they should be; if one lives their lives in supersticious nonsense they're more than likely to be a bit upset when someone with commonsense comes along and slays one of their idols.<br /><br />Hitchens uses a great dose of pragmatism along with myriad examples to make his case.  His documentation of Teresa's glad-handing support for Charles Keating was nothing short of fantastic and enthralling.  The book contains a copy of the actual letter the prosecuting DA sent to Teresa urging her to refund Keating's donations to the victims and to rethink her support for the charlatan (the twice swindled victims are still waiting for a refund).<br /><br />The info about her courting the Duvalier criminal aristocracy of Haiti is also very interesting.  He also broaches the topic of how Teresa and the Catholic hierarchy urged that woman who were raped and became pregnant during the Yugoslav conflict should refrain from aborting the fertilized egg and force themselves to give birth.  Lastly, the portion of the book dealing with the \\"Kodak/Teresa miracle\\" was hilarious!<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews and enter into the world of clear thinking rationality by reading this book.  He describes Teresa's mission and work as basically a cult of suffering and dying; a bitter truth that takes a lot of guts to say even though it's so accurate.  In the tradition of Bertrand Russell and agnostic rationalists everywhere, Hitchens delivers a bombshell.<br /><br />The title is quite enjoyable as well.	2002-07-13

The negative reviews of this book are most likely by \\"intellectuals\\" who have invested a great deal of time into memorizing post-modern/deconstructionist gibberish.  Tough to have your world turned upside down.  Of course that's exactly what S&B do in this enjoyable and controversial masterpiece.<br /><br />It's also quite an amusing book, with hilarious examples culled from the works of the authors they criticize.  S&B do a fantastic job in comparing the pseudo-math and pseudo-scientific jargon to the reality; making the complicated relatively easy to understand for the layman.<br /><br />What a welcome book that probably should have been written ten years earlier -- 1998 is the copyright year.  The fact that the intellectuals S&B exposed are often considered (by rightwingers looking to beat up progressive leftists any way they can) to be of the left, is just one more reason this book was so desperately needed.<br /><br />Anyone among the progressive left who has half a brain cell certainly realizes \\"Fashionable Nonsense\\" is a gift wrapped book to them that helps to clear up just who's committed to anti-imperialism and worker, racial and environmental justice, and who's committed to using jargon laden prose to bolster their own careers and reputations.  One of the examples in the book cites a poetry expert throwing in the 'axiom of choice in set theory' into a poetry analysis!<br /><br />Readers with the slightest bit of interest in philosophy, sociology, literary theory, and political studies should definitely pick up this book.	2002-07-12

In \\"Blackshirts and Reds\\" he again demonstrates his willingness to go against the orthodoxy of both the right, center and unfortunately left, by revealing facts and truths the powers that be just don't want to be bothered with; and many honorable leftists are afraid to utter for the fear of being branded as Stalinist sympathizers.<br /><br />His description of the current social and economic conditions for the average Eastern European and citizens of the former USSR is worth the price of the book alone. The obvious conclusion is that they'd be much better off under the old egalitarian system than their current lives of penury under the new capitalist system that Yeltsin, the nomenclatura and the United States were and are so eager to throw upon them.<br /><br />Propping up brutal undemocratic regimes (Chile, El Salvador, Indonesia, Guatamala, etc.) that are conducive to capitalist penetration and exploitation while obliterating democratically elected governments (Nicaragua, The Congo, Allende's Chile, Spain, Vietnam, East Timor, etc.) that want to follow a more egalitarian non-capitalist path are some of the things the capitalist powers have done during the last millenia.  Of course they couch their criminal conduct (often carried out by the CIA, U.S. State Department and segments of the U.S. military, some times using proxies) in euphemisms such as \\"free markets\\" and \\"free elections.\\"  Parenti delves into much of this sordid history in this fine book.<br /><br />He eloquently describes how and why the former USSR collapsed and he doesn't feel the need to constantly make casual asides about how evil Stalin supposedly was. He mentions how the Soviet Union's collapse had a lot more to do with the constant capitalist propaganda and glittery materialistic imagery of the West rather than with the failure of Communism itself. Today, the average Russian citizen would be much better off economically and socially (they wouldn't have to fend for their livelihoods against organized mafiosi or suffer through exploitative jobs or prostitute themselves) if they were still in a socialist state rather than living in the current capitalist nightmare that was rammed down their throats in a shock treatment manner.<br /><br />Parenti touches on all of this. He also delivers an array of facts and figures which demonstrate that the Gulag and Stalin were no where near the hellishness that they're often labeled as being by pro-West capitalist sympathizers and their propaganda machine.<br /><br />Lastly, his analysis of the manner in which the East Germans dealt with former sadistic Nazi criminals and fascist sociopaths (imprisoning them and holding them accountable for their execrable and hateful actions) as opposed to the coddling West Germany bestowed on them is some of the most fascinating and intellectually enlightening passages I've read in years.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book enough and I eagerly anticipate the intellectual joys his next book will bring.n citizen would be much better off economically and socially (they wouldn't have to fend for their livelihoods against organized mafiosi or suffer through exploitative jobs or prostitute themselves) if they were still in a socialist state rather than living in the current capitalist nightmare that was rammed down their throats in a shock treatment manner.<br /><br />Parenti touches on all of this.
