My son has licked doormats in department stores and is fascinated by taxidermy.  At six, he still can't read social cues as well as his younger sister and will respond to stimuli inconsistently.  He's not Christopher but he's not like anyone else either.  <br />So, it was with great enthusiasm that I approached this short novel and what I found was an insight into the experience of living that life.  I am often so busy &quot;managing&quot; my son or being embarrassed or frustrated by him that I forget how weird everything seems  to him.  I think Mark Haddon did an incredible job of illustrating both the chaos that surrounds Chistopher as well as the chaos that Christopher perceives is around him.  His behavior is merely an effort to control all the information he receives and cannot process.  SO, he eats foods of a certain color and watches the patterns of passing cars in order to make his life orderly.  However, he has no real engagement with the factors that make his parents lives disorderly.  He does not understand ambivalence , embarrassment or spite only fear and joy.<br />Fictional representations of autism and its attendant disorders often try to make the condition a blessing in disguise and the characters so affected become angels or messengers.  What Mark Haddon reminds us is that their worlds intersect with ours in something other than sweet little circles.  This novel shows the reader everything that Christopher experiences and yet is able to convey to us that Christopher can't respond to these experiences in the way all of those around him regularly do.  In fact, what Haddon does is show us how bizarre we are when the tidal wave of our daily lives is stripped of the aggression, ambition and exhaustion that fuel us.	2003-11-19

The narrative voice is so strong that it is actually jarring when one enters the next story and finds it so different.  Yes, it is true, some kids do kill their mom and there are ghosts and car accidents and rapes and one really scary phone call in this book but there is also a true recognition of the human impulse to make sense of the senseless and a desire to connect with humanity despite the pain and the cruelty.  <br />Willetts' recognition of the miraculous in even the most small-minded desires is beautiful.  Is it funny?  Yes, but not always in the way that makes you laugh.	2003-10-23
US	51022923	R3NJD3BVZE9FLE	0316153915	77432495	Chasing the Dime	Books	3	2	4	N	N	Thin as a dime	I've read a number of Connelly's books and have enjoyed most of them enough to keep reading.  That is to say, he's a fun read and I've learned about some rather interesting subjects from his research (almost everything I know about heart transplants I learned from Blood Work) but I've just finished Chasing the Dime, and I only learned one thing:  I'm going to have to think twice before reading more of Michael Connelly.<br />The protagonist,Henry Pierce, is a techno-genius of the chemical and computer varieties.  However, that doesn't protect him from being sucked into a crime by the simplest of means.  On his first day with a new telephone number Henry begins receiving calls for an escort named Lilly.  Thinking that he can correct the mix-up by contacting the woman directly (why he doesn't immediately contact the phone company is a mystery in itself) he begins to rub up against memories from his sad childhood as Connelly provides both \\"psychological insight\\" into Henry's motivations and a nod to a previous novel.  You see, Henry's sister ran away from home and was later killed by \\"The Dollmaker\\" who targeted her because she was a prostitute.<br />And then... well, then a lot of things happen which drag Henry further and further into what was Lilly's life and steadily appears to be Lilly's death.  Who dunnit? That's not really the question.  It's more along the lines of who would ever do all that?  Of course, Henry's genius mode seems to be a little streaky since he can't see how he's being manipulated for two hundred pages and then suddenly figures it all out, gathers evidence against the real criminals and captures the bad guys all while securing the real target of the crime simultaneously and all within thirty or forty pages.  <br />The novel is a little like a roller coaster ride that goes slowly and then speeds up except its not as thrilling and you sort of want your money back when the ride is over.	2003-04-30
US	51022923	R1JPFAYP7XV9ME	0316666343	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	5	1	2	N	N	A beautiful little book	This is one novel I rushed through not just because it was well-written and fascinating (and it is both of those things) but also because I really didn't want to stop somewhere and be stuck in the grieving process.  I wanted to proceed with the book so that I wouldn't have to linger with the family of a girl who was brutally raped and killed and sit in their skin as her whereabouts remain a mystery.<br />The scope is really rather small for a book which takes on the issue of what happens after one dies.  Sebold gives a quick outline of how Susie's heaven seems, what it feels like for her and how it changes as she allows the past to recede from her.  However, there is no real emphasis on what this heaven is and who goes there.  Is there an alternative place?  Will Susie's killer ultimately wind up near her?  These questions aren't really Sebold's concern.  Even so, the tight coil of pain that grips Susie's family is stunning to encounter.<br />By the end, I was a little weary of the one character who seems to have a paranormal connection to Susie and all her dead (and surprisingly anonymous) friends.  Ruth is reduced to a conduit for Susie's earthly concerns and Sebold carries this to its ultimate conclusion in a way that really does border on the truly creepy.  However, the novel steps away from the flirtation with ghostliness and really does try to examine how horror enters our lives so swiftly and devastatingly and yet it does get better.  <br />The excrutiating process is genuinely credible, especially in the cases of the father and sister.  The mother's ultimate vacation from the pain seems vague and surreal but is not entirely bizarre in the face of her loss.<br />All this being said, though, this is not a novel that stays with you.  It is absolutely riveting while you're reading but it is so specific to this family's loss that it lacks the resonance of loss that one might expect.<br />Is it better than most things out there?  Yes, it is but that probably won'tgive this novel the sort of afterlife to which it aspires.	2002-08-20

The diversity of the city may be a little too complicated for the points Carter tries to make but I think there was probably more room for the exploration of different aspects of the many races and faces that comprise our Nation's Capital.<br />However, I do realize that Carter has a different agenda than I might have had.  I am, of course, familiar with Carter's socio-political bent (conservative, African-American law professor critical of affirmative action and heavily into fundamental Christianity)and have to admit that I'm pretty much none of the above.  I simply wish the city had been able to shine.  Even so, this is a smart and pretty thrilling novel for one so big (over 600 pages)and it does have a good bit of sizzle.  <br />&quot;Emperor&quot; explores the meanings of loyalty, trust, marriage, family, career and citizenship.  However, Carter avoids slipping into preachiness and does manage to basically keep the plot percolating along for most of the way.  It is a little bit darker than I had expected and I found myself pretty depressed by the end but I really enjoyed the novel and found it 1000 times easier to read than any of Carter's articles on the law, none of which I have completed.	2002-06-05

It is a sweet book and I'd hate for all the big, bad cynics out there to get a chance to stomp all over it.  Alex's English is funny because it is comprehensible without being accurate.  Is that a funny joke for the whole time?  Maybe not, but the conceit is clever and works for the novel.  Foer's work requires a sort of patience from the reader.  After all, he's telling you with the title that he will eventually come to what he considers the payoff, so just wait for it.<br />It is a backwards bildungsroman about a young man traveling to the East and metaphorically to the previous century to find out who saved his grandfather (and thereby how he himself was allowed to live).  He is guided by Alex (who speaks a twisted English that befits his propensity for some fraction less than half-truths) and his &quot;blind&quot; grandfather, the driver.  Now, come on, just reading that, you have to admit is funny. <br />This book could have been run through the meticulous edits that would have polished it to a fine lustre but so many strange bits would have been buffed away that it could not have been worth it.<BR>So, you're still curious about the novel after everything alse you've read?  Click away and have it sent so that you too will giggle while explaining the dog's name to your friends.	2002-04-22

I agree with previous reviewers about &quot;Sign&quot; and &quot;Merry-Go-Sorry,&quot; (they are horrifyingly good)  and would like to add my praise for the fine contributions &quot;Sea Oak&quot; and &quot;Nixon Under the Bodhi Tree.&quot;  Both stories examine mortality in very different ways but reach equally exquisite conclusions.  Although the author has received enormous praise for the eponymous collection, &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot; is just a wonderful story about travel, confession, nationality and marriage.  I love this collection and cannot believe that any sane person would worry about the future of the short story as long as such treasures are being created.<br />On a side note, Stephen King's introduction is eloquent and poignant.  He was probably a great asset to the panel of judges and may even bring his own readership to the short story in general.	2002-02-18

US	51022923	R1DOTZFFEMGN7M	0374100128	647099960	The Corrections	Books	5	4	4	N	N	Please disregard other reviews	This is no sweet family saga.  Franzen has no interest in the heartwarming or the poignant.  He is talking about what we as a nation have become.  I realize that our country is currently suffering a mild case of the blues.  We seek comfort because our daily lives are so uncomfortable and strange but Franzen's point seems to be that we have become a weird nation.  We are disengaged from the people who gave birth to us and the people to whom we give birth.  We relate in only the most oblique ways to one another.  Yet we do try to connect and repeatedly fail because we have forgotten how those connections once fed us.<br />The Lamberts are coming apart at the seams.  Dad suffers from Parkinson's and Mom wants one more family Christmas before the inevitable decline settles in.  Son Chip is an academic star become washout.  Daughter Denise has contorted her mother's dreams for her of domestic bliss into a failed marriage, a mysterious new relationship (or is it?) and the head chef position at Philly's new hot restaurant.  And Gary, eldest son and financial success, is sinking under the weight of either all the things he has accrued or clinical depression.  The details of the novel invade your mind and evoke everything about the people around you that you were too squeamish to note.  <br />This is a depressing book if you are easily knocked off your pins but it is also darkly humorous (even hilarious in places) and really, really smart.  I've seen the other reviews posted and some of them are terrible but this is a great book about the tough subject of what it means to be an American.  I fear that Oprah has probably hoodwinked some readers by leading them to believe this is another Wally Lamb novel or an inspirational story of one woman's triumph over adversity.  Get over yourself.  This is a great nation and each and every one of us is tough enough to stand this hard look at what we have become.	2001-10-18

The portrait of a marriage is surprisingly &quot;modern,&quot; with both  sexual and intellectual components that might shock the reader but are welcome to a complete portrait of a great man.

However, it will teach you how to live within a character's perspective.  The details of High Point Farm are exquisite.  The messy steps where lost belongings eventually appear, the animals that link the people to one another, the house itself all resonate of truth.  Is this a great book?  Probably not.  For four hundred pages each of the character's becomes and stays traumatized by a crime that none of them deserved but all served to amplify.  Then, in the last fifty pages or so they are all healed (except for those who die).  We are all weak.  However, few of us are as weak as Mike Mulvaney the elder.  He visits upon his own family the violent separation of parent and child which haunted his youth.  His wife Corrinne gives Christians,wives and moms a bad name so that's a pretty powerful trifecta.  The children are vivid at times and then relegated to secondary status as adults.  It is as if they cease to be interesting to Oates when they become adults.  Maybe that's because adults eventually have to stop worrying about the sins of their parents and must then focus on their own impact on the world.  Still, I liked the book and would recommend it to budding writers as an example of several elements of the craft.  However, for those of us who were not the Mulvaneys, it may be a bit tedious in its relentless adolescence.	2001-05-16

I read this lovely book on vacation and was, as a result, a little dubious of its true merit.  After all, what isn't a great book when you are on the beach reading it?  However, I reread it in my own habitat and am convinved that Robert Cohen is on to something. Bonnie is neither cute nor evil.  She is frustrated, disappointed, and anxious about her children, her unplanned pregnancy, her husband's flaky departure to South America and all the other imperfect aspects of her life in Cambridge.  On top of all this, she can't get to sleep.  She thinks everything else would recede in importance if only she could get 40 winks.<br />Ian Ogelvie is the quintessential academic rising star.  Fellowships and grants have rained down upon him since he started school and now, facing 30, he is on the brink of a pharmaceutical breakthrough that could seal his fate...and save Bonnie's neck.  So, Cohen has them meet and the results are insightful, funny, critical, and real.  It is neither love story nor thriller.  It is merely the story of a handful of characters whose desires and fears blind them to simple solutions their lives offer.<br />This novel was witty in the way our own lives would be clever if we weren't desperately trying to figure out where they were going.  I don't think it's necessary to rebut the one harsh review written of this book, but I would encourage anyone with the slightest bit of interest in seeing what the fuss is about to click and order.  This book will interest you.  You know people like these.  Some of you, perhaps the most honest ones, realize that you are people like these.	2001-03-29

The problem, however, is that nobody told me what I am perfectly willing to let you know and that is that this is the most bizarre story to ever begin normally.  You see, Col. Behrani is not crazy at the outset of the novel and neither is Kathy Nicolo but the tug-of-war over this modest bungalow drives them both insane.  Furthermore, it would be one thing if they were the only victims of this folie de deux, but others suffer because these two invest the house with a meaning that this reader did not comprehend.  <br />Everyone made a big secret of the mad ending but it's no big secret that nothing good is going to come out of this struggle.  In fact, the only reason for not disclosing it here and now is that it is so weird that it would seem silly in a plot synopsis.  Les Burdon (what a ridiculously named man for someone who only increases everyone's burden) does the unthinkable not because he is evil but because he is desperate.  However, on even the foggiest day, desperate can look a whole lot like stupid.  <br />All this being said, it's not a terrible novel and the writing is fluid and graceful in many places but it's really difficult to like a novel with characters that resemble puppets so much and a plot with all the strings showing.	2001-02-26

She is being framed for the murder of her nemesis the psychologically unstable Diane Bray but it is obvious to all her friends that she is uninvolved and Kay is even able to cozy up to her prosecutor long before they enter the courtroom.  That is to say, I never felt that Kay was in any sort of real trouble.  Furthermore, the real bad guy is obvious due to the fact that everyone feels &quot;sort of funny&quot; about him.  His genetic relationship to another criminal makes the whole thing ludicrous.  Let's think this through.  How could a man even get a job in law enforcement if he could not verify his educational records?  He claims he went to Harvard but there's no record of him.  He claims to be a certain person but that name matches nobody of his age according to Social Security records.  If he's so powerfully mobbed up then why can't he cover his tracks a little better.  Besides, don't these folks know anything about leaving DNA at the scene of the crime.  If you are indeed a werewolf-like individual then you might want to be careful about those pesky shedding hairs.  If you are the brother of such an individual and you are having sex with women and then brutally killing them, you may want to consider the use of a condom.  Maybe it's just me, but I have read much better books and a few of them were written by Patricia Cornwell.  Better luck next time.	2001-02-01

The problem is not the others, though.  It truly is Domenick.  His litany of burdens becomes crippling because he is a LOSER of a character.  The plot is incredible but Domenick is just tedious to watch as one thing after another happens to him and he becomes more and more impotent in his rage.  His therapist, however, saves the day and it is no great surprise that 1000 pages of torment earns Domenick a picture-perfect and fully healed life.  Of course, not everyone else survives the train wreck of a novel and the corpses stack up like a bad production of Hamlet.  <br />Even so, it is a good and serious novel by Wally Lamb and a vast improvement on that Schlock festival called She's Come Undone.  He is probably an author to watch as he develops his craft.	2000-12-18

Ms McDermid has written a beautiful novel about loss of innocence on the individual and national planes.  Allison Carter's murder haunts everyone whose life it touches in 1963.  What the players do not realize is that this crime will continue to have victims 35 years later.  As layer upon layer of secrets come to light, the motives of police, family and journalist come into question.<br />I read the novel quickly and then lent it out immediately so that I could have someone else with whom to talk about it.  The novel gives a complete picture of village life in the early '60s as modern England begins to leave behind its feudal past as a relic of history.  Please do yourself the grand favor of reading this superb mystery.	2000-11-27

At least Jane was aware that she was pathetic and the quotations interspersed throughout made me feel like I was learning a little about science and philosophy.  Even so, Jane, her friends, Joan and David (whose shoes I happen to adore)her roommate and especially the one who got away are all a real bore after a while.  Roy is unlovable and perhaps Ms. Zigman is guilty of writing a novel based a little too closely on personal tragedy because she truly characterizes Roy as the worst kind of wimp.  He is absolutely pathetic and Jane's long slump that follows their breakup renders her pathetic.  However, the book is light reading (make that lite) and harmless.  Getting upset about the sexual politics of this book is a little like hating Elmo's morals.	2000-11-13
US	51022923	R2LBND1GW4B355	0446602620	435728437	Blood Work	Books	4	2	2	N	N	Fun and Informative	I'm not sure if this was Connelly's goal but I couldn't help but be impressed with the research he seemed to have done in order to make the novel credible.  The reader learns about heart transplants and computers.  There's something about FBI procedure and the way bullets are linked to specific guns.  It's great.  Furthermore, the plot is really gripping.  Sure, you might sit back a week later and think, &quot;That was a little ridiculous, wasn't it?&quot; but while you are in the throes, you will be enthralled.  A heart transplant patient asked by the sister of his donor to solve the murder which gave him life.  Never mind that the recipient is a former hotshot FBI agent and also never mind that the murder is the work of a true fiend.  The novel is more morally complex than books which are equally fun to read and it is more fun to read than more books that are more morally complex.	2000-11-13

But, really, the questions remains:  So what?  Helen Fielding is clever but even she has to know that Bridget is a joke and all that calorie-counting and cigarette tallying isn't very sustainable.  If Bridget wants a different life, then why in the world is she obsessed with enumerating the idiocies of the one she has?	2000-10-30

Boyle fan, I had high expectations of this book and it did not disappoint.  It is the story of several intersecting lives but primarily those of the Mossbachers and the Rincons.  The tapestry of circumstances grows larger and more complex as these couples gradually come to despise and fear what their counterparts have come to represent.  Delaney could have been written as a caricature but Boyle allows the doubts and passions of this secure upper-middle-class Topanga resident to lend depth and breadth to someone in whom every reader has at least some flicker of recognition.  <br />Although I live on the other coast of the country, the omnipresence of domestic workers and landscapers with brown faces is as true here as it is in Boyle's fictional Southern California.  Making their stories not just sympathetic but also complicated lends reality to these faces without sinking into condescension.  I really appreciated that about the novel and found the ending surrealistic but thematically genuine.  <br />I was reliving the reality of the book for days afterward and thought about myself in many of those characters for a long time afterwards.	2000-10-12

I'll admit to being too snobby about books which find a wide audience and I'm afriad I may have carried that baggage into reading this book.  I thought Kathryn was too naive and seemed to experience life as it happened to her instead of having any power to change the circumstances into which she was thrust.  However, I don't really know how a person asserts power when facing such complete loss.  Even so, I found the whole notion of Jack's utter betrayal of Kathryn somewhat incredible.  How could a man who deeply cares for his daughter so totally disregard the feelings of his wife?  <br />Ultimately, the book is both entertaining and relevant but it is not very deep. Kathryn Lyons is simply a vessel for the story and no details differentiate her from any widow who finds out that her dearly departed husband was a jerk and a liar.	2000-09-28

He turned out to be interested in a close friend (7 years married, two kids) but I'm so grateful for meeting him because of this  book.  The evocation of erotic love is masterful, spare and unique.  The  richness of the images and the emotional journey that the reader takes as  witness to the affair is breathtaking.  The lovers' fate is heartbreaking  and yet perfectly in keeping with the toning of longing for the inchoate.   I loved this book and used it as a measure of men until I met my husband.	2000-07-14

There is a depth of self-understanding that may qualify as navel gazing.  Nevertheless, the worldly, educated Arab trying  to negotiate his place in the world is not one we have seen in American  media.  Said's comprehension of the impact his parents'roles in his early  life illuminates our understanding of the man responsible for some of the  most thoughtful literary and political criticism in the area of East versus  West.  Is the story enthralling at every juncture? No.  Is it sometimes  downright creepy inits details? Yes.  However, it is brilliantly written  and ultimately very interesting.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am  an Arab-American and I must admit that Said's memoir gives voice to some of  the insecurity and existential anxiety that I felt as a young woman.  It  provides the narration to a terrifying episode of history and examines the  human impact of loss in its many facets.	1999-10-11
