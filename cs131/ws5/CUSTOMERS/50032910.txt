I am back to revise my review and tell you that this is a wonderfully touching book. All the items the critics have offered here I think are overblown - the characters are well developed, their motivations fully explained and the story line, is unique. Afterall while we always know the 2 characters are going to end up happily ever-after, in this book the main characters have already told us they were deeply in love with each other - circumstances let them part with each other and it wasn't until they were older and wiser that they were able to come together.      I do still have one criticism, I wish the author had brought in more of her original characters - Lizzie's parents were the stars of their own story several years ago but they never appear, for the most part, in this book. But on the other hand -if you've not been following the Effington stories you'll have no trouble picking up here.	2005-01-25

Well although by the reviews you may have guessed the answer, just let the author get you there. This book is well worth the read - it's fun, intriguing and you end up pulling for two versions of the same hero! The heroine is a little too unsure of herself considering she ends up as a strong independent woman, but it's not so misdrawn that it'll annoy you.	2005-01-22
US	50032910	R39NZJWS1IDQAA	0380802325	85428738	Suddenly You	Books	5	4	5	N	N	A Refreshingly Enjoyable Book	Like one of the other reviewers here, I also discovered this book years after it was first released; and can't believe I almost let it pass by me. The characters are unique, the storyline different and refreshing, and the scenes are written with enough color to paint a picture but not so much detail that you start skimming past to get to the dialogue. There's not the usual angst or silly misunderstandings that provide the tension for the hero and heroine, rather its that neither would settle for less than a great romance and yet neither ever expected it to happen to them.  How they come to realize that they can actually trust in what they found is beautiful. <br />	2005-01-22

So I've tried to stick to just the few select authors who I love to follow. However I was stuck at a small midwest airport recently and book was the only light reading they had on hand. So... it was good. Not amazing, I'll admit, but enough that it kept my interest and intrigued enough to check out other works.  I'll write separate review for them, but for this one I'll say the text and dialogue are refreshing and intelligent. I like that her characters aren't the usual dukes and high aristocracy but rather upper-middle class. Wealthy enough to give it fantasy but real enough to make the story relatable.	2005-01-22

If you're reading the series and following all the characters then certainly read it. If you're just looking for a good book to read, try almost any of her other novels. The research in this one, while great for the geography just doesn't do it for the characters... example, a police detective who looks to the side character/secondary hero to determine how to go find a missing person. Some detective.  Also the secondary characters are so powerful in this book, probably because the fans are highly in anticipation of their story, that it was hard to remember to book was about the two main characters its written for. I suppose the one thing this book did do for me is that, I can't wait for the next one (about the side characters! :) ).	2005-01-05

Johnston creates beautiful characters who are easy to love, the story is honest in that decisions are made based on practical realities.

The stories are simply too simplistic and you never develop a connection to the characters.	2002-11-19

It's a little farfetched with the story primarily one of good guys chasing bads, the couple trapped in a desert location (Big Bend) and forced to depend on each other... But Johnston tells the story with warmth and heart.  This is the second book in the series, The Cowboy was the first and The Loner is the third.  Although it is helpful to have read the first before reading the third, it's not essential - you'll probably want to read it anyway after you finish this one!	2002-11-19

The book is funny, witty and although a bit slow at a few places, the only reason it is so is because if you're a fan of the series you've just been WAITING for these two to get it together for so long!  <br />Quinn's novels have never completely bowled me over, I enjoy a couple other authors a little more reliably, but I am glad to add this one to my collection.  Her solid writing and sense of humor are evident in each novel.  The characters in this particular book are great to enjoy whether you've read the rest of the series or not.<br />I was really intrigued by the thank you note the author included in the beginning - she thanks Stephanie Laurens and another author for the use of their characters - had me re-reading a lot of my other books too just to see which characters she was referring to.... :)	2002-07-11

In general I have loved Joan Johnston's Blackthorne/Creed series.  The characters all have flaws and yet they are all deeply romantic.  However this installment seemed to not develop the richness of the characters in the same way the previous books did.  I also realize that it's difficult to keep up the intensity of a series that has so many installments; and I do look forward to the next book nonetheless.  Readers of the series will enjoy this book to see what has happened to some of their favorite characters and especially to see Summer and Billy finally bring and end to the family feuds.	2002-06-13

One of the truly strong points in a Laurens novel is that the supporting characters have been developed, loved, nurtured, and featured in such a way that you come to anticipate their own story.  And yet the author has a remarkable talent for creating a story that will stand on its own and allow the reader to jump into the series without feeling lost.<br />This particular book as all the fancy, romance and sensuality of a Laurens novel.  It also had some new twists, intriguing hurdles for the characters to overcome.  There does come a moment when you just want to hit the hero on the head and say, get over it already!, and yet just as you reach that pinnacle, Laurens does it for you through the witty dialogue and fast-paced story line.<br />A good fun read!	2002-05-24

Well I've often found myself haunting the bookstores waiting for the next Laurens' book to come out.  Unfortunately, on this one, I wish Laurens had taken a little more time between coming out with Amanda's story in One a Wild Night and Amelia's story in this book.  While much of the wit in dialogue, passion and romance still appear in this book, you are left wondering what happened to all the rich detail.<br />One of the most wonderful features of a Laurens' novel is the way the main characters come to life against the background of the supporting characters.  Here a few of the names of the Cynster clan are tossed about, and the Ashford family members are mentioned, but you don't really \\"see\\" these people.  Perhaps the only supporting character to have a true role in the story is the hero's mother.  But even then, Laurens tells you the Luc feels compelled to keep his mother apprised of his plans, she immediately senses his budding love for Amelia, and yet you know nothing more about her, her relationship with Luc, etc.<br />Another disappointment was the brief glimpse at Devil and Honoria, the two main characters that set off the Cynster series. It was touching to see their relationship still evolving, but handled rather unfulfillingly.<br />I wouldn't have missed this novel since I'm an avid fan of the series, but for those picking up a Laurens novel for the first time, please go back a read some of her earlier works. They are true delights, this is only a hint of what can be.	2002-05-24

And was thoroughly surprised.  I have enjoyed Jo Beverley's writings in the past so that wasn't the surprise, but the description on that back doesn't really give you a sense of the depth of emotion and feeling you will get from both characters.

But this book just drags on and on and on... I wound up wanting to yell at both main characters - get over it all ready! The author seems to have tried for a psychological story line, exploring emotional hang ups the characters didn't even know they had. But the therapy sessions are unbelievable. The mental explorations are tedious. Very disappointing.	2001-11-09

This one was a recommendation from amazon based on some other purchases I had made and it was a great find! The book is funny, well-paced, richly descriptive and provides some new twists on the ancient story of a rogue turned devoted husband.  Ms. Quinn provides a bit of an apology in her book for the hero's &quot;obstacle&quot; but i see no reason for it. She makes a believable case for the quirk in fate that guides this character's story and one, whether based on scientific fact or not, that is so carefully integrated into the story that you just accept it as fact.
