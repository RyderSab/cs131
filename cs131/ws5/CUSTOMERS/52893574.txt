The individual portraits that emerge of Pa, Mo, Auntie Joan and Uncle Otis, as well as Harry and the ancillary characters of his friends and neighbors are spot on. I really don't think they could be better.  And the writing for the most part is superb. (For example, one might say \\"I fainted into my father's arms.\\" Clare Sambrook says, \\"The tarmac sped up towards me, but when it hit me it was soft and warm and smelt of Pa.\\" Lovely. And the book is filled with things like this.)  The only false note I think Sambrook hits is in taking Mo down a path which, while the motivation certainly is clear, doesn't seem realistic in its execution. (Sorry this is vague but I don't believe in spoilers. I think if you read the book you'll know what I'm referring to.) So that--and the fact that in my opinion the title seems off--is my reason for giving this book less than 5 stars.  Call it 4.5 and go find this book; it's well worth reading. Clare Sambrook is a gem of a writer and I look forward to her next one.	2005-08-31

This book is so heartfelt, profound, and lovely that I hated for it to end. Although I've been a fan for years, to me Pull of the Moon set a bar whose level Berg has never quite reached since. The Year of Pleasures changes that opinion, and in fact I think it functions very well as a companion piece to that earlier book. I hope that Ms. Berg will consider revisiting this set of characters, as I would love to see where life takes them next.	2005-05-27

The characters, as other readers have pointed out, are hardly likeable (the only one I had any feelings at all for was the child molester, the best developed character in my opinion), but if the book had been better that might not have mattered to me as much.  As it was, I found myself skimming through the unbearablly long football scenes and predictable plot line that made up the last third of the book.  For my money, a better, certainly more entertaining look at similar (though admittedly not the same) people can be found in \\"The Nanny Diaries.\\"	2004-07-03

I know that Berg can deliver the goods, and frankly this book doesn't do it.  I get the controlling metaphor of the quilt, but I agree with the reviewer who thought that the &quot;secret&quot; wasn't shocking enough(which may be a sad commentary on what I've become inured to.) Also, Berg clearly shows us in the vignettes that begin most chapters that Laura,too,is guilty of abusive behavior towards Caroline, yet this isn't really explored with the depth that could have made for something really interesting. There are many wonderful pieces to this patchwork story, but ultimately it falls short.  It will, however, send many people (myself included) scurrying to find the episodic Lost Lake by Mark Slouka, despite the fact that its mention seemed as jarring as a toothpaste commercial during an episode of Law and Order:SVU.	2004-04-29

The guide is geared to high school students, and would provide good supplementary material to a unit on Jane Eyre. Buyers should know, however, that it is written from a Christian perspective, and therefore also includes questions based on particular biblical passages as they relate to the novel.  This is certainly not a bad thing, but not something I expected.	2003-12-17

This particular story has a few holes and a couple of paths that lead to dead ends, but the characters are so real and interesting that I still really liked it. And once again, the writing is great. Solomon never seems to run out of new ways to describe things that a less artful writer would probably ignore just to avoid using cliches. (Or worse, would use cliches, which would sink this story with banality.)<BR>Oh, and I love the ending which you'll just have to read yourself. Knowing how and when to stop writing takes enormous skill. Kudos to Solomon and her editor just for that.<BR>Nina Solomon is definitely on my list of writers to watch.

While The Da Vinci Code IS a page-turner and the premise seems promising, even fascinating, this book is really just a beach or airplane novel disguised as high art.

I love Belle Epoque Paris (and actually, Paris in general). I love good historical fiction. I hated this book!  I looked forward to reading this more than anything in a long time, and am utterly disappointed.  The stars I have given it go to what I believe to be Gioia Diliberto's talent as a researcher.  As a writer of fiction, (once again, in my opinion alone) she is sorely lacking.   The character of Virginie that Diliberto fashioned is so unbelievably self-absorbed as to be one-dimensional and her tale is told in clunky, graceless prose that I frankly found nearly unreadable. The cover is by far the best thing about this book. If that's what fascinates you about it, go find a book of Sargent's artwork.  Whatever you imagine about the figures you see in his paintings will be far, far more rewarding than anything you glean from Diliberto's novel.	2003-05-07

This book falls into the same category as &quot;The Lake of Dead Languages&quot; in a couple ways--A. An interesting, somewhat obscure title, B. dark doings at an all-girls' school.  Unfortunately, they also share in my ultimate disdain.  Uppal's tale of pain and betrayal shows a lot of promise at the start that it fails miserably to deliver. The first third is actually pretty good (hence, even a single star), but starting with Angela's sister's admittance of hatred for her (huh? what happened here? We're presented with a character with an interesting set of issues who then disappears from the book without any indication as to why she reacts to Angela the way she does!) the  story starts to unravel into a somewhat well-written mess. After what turns out to be a book-long red herring, the whole mystery of the candlestick never actually resolves; the ending, as others here have noted, is enough to give a person whiplash. Finally, on another subject altogether, I was amazed at how a story that takes place in a religious setting could be so Godless.  Angela it seems became a nun to punish herself (which could have been interesting if it had been authentically explored) and even her mother's faith, which one assumes was genuine, seemed hollow to me.  I couldn't help but feeling that this author was writing about something that she doesn't know much about. Save yourself from this book and if you want to read about children turning on each other, read &quot;The Lord of the Flies.&quot; Or just find a book with a less interesting title and better crafted plot.	2003-03-26

The almost poetic narrative descriptions are stunning in their ability to evoke time, place and social class. Her portrait of Lydia Blessing, both past and present, is quite brilliant.<br />The many themes of life (love, urequited dreams, change, chance, tolerance and acceptance, to name a few) are woven delicately and well. <br />The only thing I didn't like about this book was the last page. The last lines felt awkward and insignificant, which seemed so uncharacteristic to the rest of the book. I still strongly recommend &quot;Blessings&quot;, especially to women over 40.	2002-11-19

This book is obviously well researched, and the number of threads he is able to weave together is head-spinning.

I have to say that I was not as impressed with this debut as some of the other reviewers.  While it had a fascinating premise, and did keep me turning pages, I was ultimately left unsatisfied. There's nothing to indicate why these two women are so repressed and essentially emotionally [messed] up. The sibling issues are nicely treated, but all in all I felt it was very hard to make a connection with these people. The New York Times Book Review comments that it feels like you're looking at this world through the wrong end of a set of binoculars; I completely agree.    From a strictly mechanical viewpoint, I also had problems with the author switching between first and third person as she alternates between the sisters' perspectives, finding it cumbersome and detractive to the story itself. Because McGovern is a skilled writer, I have to figure that this was done for a purpose. I just didn't get it.	2002-09-17

Since then, after reading backwards and forwards through her body of work, I have liked, loved and have been disappointed by books she has written. Her last (Open House) had me wondering from time to time where my Elizabeth Berg had gone. I was worried that perhaps she had joined the school of writing by word processor that so many &quot;popular&quot; novelists seem to subscribe to (insert intriguing plot  device here). But then along comes this one and my socks are knocked off once again. If you even sort of like her, you've got to read this book. If you've never read her, this is a fine place to start (you can skip Open House and a couple others, but by all means go back to Pull and Talk before Sleep, Durable Goods and Joy School) I couldn't put Never Change down.
