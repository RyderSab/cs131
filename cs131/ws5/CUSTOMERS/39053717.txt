A fascinating life story which then morphed into the biography of a son.  I picked it up on sale thinking it looked really interesting...and it was...at first.  I was disappointed when Lula, the subject of the biography, was forgotten as soon as Stevie signed with Motown.  We no longer have Lula's biography, we have \\"Stevie Wonder:  The Early Years\\".  After the Stevie section started we merely get asides mentioning that Lula is divorced, Lula is remarried, Lula is divorced, again.  Not what I signed up for when I started reading it.	2005-03-02

I take issue with those that thought it was otherwise.  The way we are taken through thoughts, stories, and experiences in what seems like a fairly random order...and are also privy to what are the lies that pop through her head...was outstanding.  I was less \\"impressed\\" with Clara's vocabulary than with her imagination.  The reader of this book is promised a trip through a plethora of emotions that is diminished in a review.  I can't begin to do it justice.  When I finished it, I called everyone I know that enjoys fiction and recommended it highly...as I do here.	2005-01-30
US	39053717	R12ETWY5RX0TZK	0316168815	784206304	The Lovely Bones	Books	4	2	3	N	N	Great!	Sebold did a wonderful job, I think, writing something extremely fresh.  To have an entire story told from the viewpoint of a person who has been ripped out of the story was ingenious.  Just as ingenious was to start the book with Suzie's murder.  It was so gruesome and horrible that if we had already developed compassion for the characters we could not have read further.  Much better than diluting the brutality of the murder for the comfort of the readers.  Because of her technique, I was able to feel the pain of the survivors.<br /><br />Another thing I loved was how she explored the individuality of heaven.  Brilliant!<br /><br />Great imagination!  Great way to tell a story!	2004-09-12

I guess, for me, it just left a whole lot to be desired.<br /><br />The main characters were very one-dimensional.  In fact, ALL of the characters were one-dimensional and needed a lot of development.<br /><br />I can't say I'd never read another Pyper book again but I can say I'm not rushing out to see if there are any more.	2004-09-11

I have found that I really haven't even thought about it at all since I finished the last page and that's too bad.  I like to take something with me after the book goes back to the library's shelves.<br /><br />Cal's story (along with the story of his entire family) took a lot of different twists and turns.  It was funny, sad, scary, happy, confusing, and tiring.  That's life....Cal's just had a twist.  J.E. does a good job delivering what I think would be believable happenings.  His writing was extremely easy to read and full of great imagery.  Like a previous reviewer wrote, his city descriptions were dead on.<br /><br />This is the first book I've read by Eugindes and while it didn't leave me begging for more I am still planning on reading \\"The Virgin Suicides\\".  I recommend it without hesitation.	2004-08-29

Talk about going over the top in being unable to write even one character that would be believable.  A too perfect 5-yr old, a workaholic mother that turns into an obsessive mommy, a wienie husband, an even bigger wienie love interest, a social worker/babysitter...just not one person to like.  Throw them in with a plot that goes from strange to downright unbelievable and you've got a book that merits very little time or attention.<br /><br />This was my 2nd Picoult book and I must say I was very disappointed.  The first (Second Glance) was what inspired me to try another of hers.  I think I'll wait awhile before (IF) I risk it again.	2004-08-01

To take the outline of a biblical story and create such a novel was outstanding. Ms. Diamant did a fabulous job of creating believable personalities and believable events surrounding a group of women that we know very little about.<br /><br /> My comment to those who closed it because they were offended that it wasn't &quot;truth&quot;: Open your mind to enjoy a great story. Reading this novel seeking biblical truths would be tantamount to reading Al Franken seeking the Democratic Platform. Go to C.S. Lewis, M. Scott Peck, or Phillip Yancey for theology. Read this for the same reason you'd read Tolstoy, Shelley, or any other writer of great fiction.	2004-07-31

He seemed to skip around a lot and never followed one course for very long. The ending I found really annoying when he started to devote tiny chapters to alternate theories and introduced new people. I think I was hoping more for some type of insight into the race relations between the 2 towns...I was short-changed in that aspect.<br /><br /> The reviews of people from St. Joe I find interesting. Mainly because they say the book is inaccurately negative and they don't see that type of discrimination and hostility. I think that if you stepped back into time about 150 years you'd hear the same thing from slave owners. How, it &quot;just isn't that bad&quot;. One of the things I did find most surprising was these attitudes of racism happened in the '90s and are probably still happening. It read more like something out of the '60s. How distressing!<br /><br /> It's a story that needs to be told but I didn't like the manner in which it was done. Easy to read, though, and worth the time.	2004-07-31

The author does an outstanding of job of painting a picture with her words.  You can picture Johnnie May's dad standing on the riverbank...in one spot...refusing to move until they find his little girl's body.  You can picture and even feel the cool blue of the swimming pool on Volta Place.  You can smell the herbs in Ella's home.  You can move in and stay while you become a part of the book.  I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />I will recommend to my book-lover friends but I will tell my friends that only occasionally pick up a book to try something else...this probably won't satisfy.	2004-07-30

If you're a liberal, you'll laugh your tail off (if the vulgarity isn't too offensive for you). If you're a conservative then it will be more difficult but if you can remove yourself from the political arena and read it as comedy you might be able to laugh a bit, but I doubt it.<br /><br /> Problem...it needs to be taken for what it is. Satire. I am a bit frightened that people are reading this as a serious democrat's statement. I am HOPING that is not Franken's intention. He is a comedian....and he's writing one funny book...and he's making fun of people he really doesn't like. However, he is also stepping into the ring with the right's Limbaugh and Coulter who spout nothing but crap about the left. If he is seriously pulling us into that pissing contest then I will be more than a little disappointed.<br /><br /> Do not look to this book to reveal any &quot;truths&quot; to you. Find the truth through more credible sources. Find the humor with Franken.<br /><br /> I gave it 3 stars because I didn't want to be accused of giving it 5 stars (for the humor) because I'm a liberal and I didn't want to give it 1 star (as a political work).	2004-07-29

I loved how Kidd develops each one individually and uniquely.  The descriptions of the ladies and how their hats represented who they were was outstanding.  They were, in my opinion, what made the book worth reading.  The story itself wasn't bad but it wasn't as wonderful as I had been anticipating with all of the positive press it's been receiving.  It did, however, have it's moments.  Moments of funny, sad, scary, ridiculous, etc...it stretched the gamut of emotions but ended up being a little too sweet and kind of strange.  Worth reading...but not award-winning.	2004-07-29

I had never even heard of an eugenics project until I read this but it has me searching for more information.  The story itself was fascinating.  At first, each character seemed so disconnected from the other that I couldn't even imagine where we were being taken.  By the end of the book their lives are so intertwined...amazing.  What a wonderful way to tell a great story.	2004-07-29

Wow...He could have taken this to the limit and ended up with a really great book.  He didn't.  Instead, he got lazy with it.  I felt there was no real character development and the entire storyline came across as simple.  You were not pulled into these people's lives at all.  I had no desire to learn anything more about who they were or where they came from.<br /><br />I pulled this off the shelf hoping for a book that would not only entertain me but would also make me really think about my thoughts and positions on a not too unrealistic possiblity...taking a deep look into various viewpoints of a current topic.  What I got was a Harlequin level romance which ended up turning into a fairytale.  No, thanks.  If I want a good fairytale, I'll stick with the brothers Grimm.<br /><br />I save 1 star ratings for items that deserve a zero.  This one gets 2 from me merely for the promising storyline.  I hope someday, someone will take the idea and really run with it.	2004-07-28

Not only to capture it but then be able to transfer that on to the reader.  You can smell the sweetness of the talcum through the sticky of the hot summer days.  Sickly sweet.  The church group women are vicious in their sweetness.  Ardently praying for the savages in Africa while embracing the savage mores of the south.

I was able to finish it but I credit that to an extremely boring day at work.<br />It never ceases to amaze me that people will grasp onto a book like this and sing its praises.  This is not &quot;literature&quot;.  It is a trite story written for 6th graders.  There is no mystery, nothing left for the imagination, nothing to build toward.  From the moment you meet the main characters you realize where you're being led and how it will all turn out.<br />I closed the book and am left with nothing a few characters that will leave my memory as soon as I begin my next book.

There were a LOT of discussions of Russian politics and farming practices that, to me, were cumbersome.  However, the last 3 paragraphs of the entire book were worth it all.

Other times, you'll read a book and it will give you one passage, or one scene, that keeps coming back into your mind.  This book has done both for me.  It will not only stick with me, but has left me with a great memory of a woman and her sons, on a day when she discovers what the miracle of her life is.  It was moving beyond words.<br />Now, for the bad...the ending did not disappoint me to the degree it did some of the other reviewers.  I think maybe because someone gave it away in their review and so I was anticipating it all along (shame on you!!!!).  However, it was a disjointed ending that didn't fit with the flow of the rest of the story.<br />No matter.  I enjoyed the read and have left it feeling satisfied.

I started reading this, interestingly enough, this summer on a flight to Dublin and finished it on my flight home 6 days later.  My trip, I think, had much to do with how I felt about the book once I completed it.  Prior to being in Ireland, I was reading as a complete outsider.  I didn't get as absorbed into the characters as I did returning.  Being in Ireland...being in the places mentioned in the book...spending time in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland changed my experience in reading.  I became much more passionate about the fight that was fought and the principles these men believed in.  Without this experience surrounding my reading of this book I would have only given it 2-3 stars.  The 4 stars are completely subjective and are reflective entirely of how I experienced this book.  I recommend it but cannot promise it will change your world.	2003-09-02

When I first started reading this book I was immediately drawn into each of the 2 main characters.  I could easily identify with each of them.  As the story intensified so did my feelings.  In fact, the author did so well that as I read from each person's standpoint I was swayed back and forth to their respective argument.  I loved it.  Then, suddenly, this ring of truth to which I was identifying lost something...and something more.  I went from seeing where each was coming from..and how I could easily do the same things to saying &quot;Yeah, right&quot; to myself as I read further.  All actions and reactions became, in my opinion, grossly exaggerated to the point of becoming completely unbelievable.  This, to me, made the story lose it's appeal.

I ended up handing it over to him and having him read it on his own...I did not want my tears and my interpretations to influence his experience with this story.  I watched his face as he read each night.  I could see him experience the same things I experienced....the same things I'm certain my dad experienced as well.  When he had finished it (it took him a few weeks...it is not light reading for a 9 yr old) he closed the book and sat and absorbed it for quite some time.

It's well-documented and the photographs are very applicable.<br />While not necessarily what I consider a 5-star book, it was recommended to me by an avid history and military history reader whose opinion I regard highly.
