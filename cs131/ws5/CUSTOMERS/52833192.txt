The book's impact is extremely powerful. Few could remain unmoved or  continue to be indifferent to the cruelty of war after reading these  accounts. But why should anyone, including those who are are already  committed to the antiwar cause, subject themselves to such an excruciating,  and at times horrifying, reading experience? For the simple reason that  opposition to war must be grounded, not in abstractions, but in life, in  the experience of the human race. For the simple reason that genuine  antipathy toward war must be based on empathy, empathy with people who are  not family or neighbors, but people from a different place and time. <br />The  war forming the background for the book is World War II, with some  references to the Korean and Vietnam wars. The contributors are all  Japanese women from all walks of life. Their recollections, divided into  ten categories according to the nature of the experience, include accounts  of women trying to make their way back to Japan amid postwar chaos in  foreign lands (Manchuria, Korea, the Philippines, Sakhalin); and accounts  of nurses, of teachers, of women struggling to provide for themselves and  their families in the ruins of a defeated Japan, of victims of the  Hiroshima bombing, of women who prostituted themselves to American  servicemen, of women who contracted tragic marriages and liaisons with  American soldiers or who were the alienated offspring of such marriages, of  women widowed by war, and of women who overcame seemingly insurmountable  wartime obstacles to emerge triumphant. Although each woman's story is  uniquely tragic, there is a common thread: each has become a woman against  war.	2000-03-13

Yet, while the limits of the known cosmos are being increasingly pushed back, life, the closest thing, remains a mystery. <br />Shakyamuni viewed life from  a different perspective. He believed that life is not an abstract concept,  but rather, it involves living in the world and achieving enlightenment in  the midst of reality, while coping with joy and sorrow, pleasure and pain.  <br />In writing this book, Daisaku Ikeda has sought to reveal the  relationship linking the mystery of life as interpreted by Buddhism with  empirical deductions of science, explaining spatial and temporal aspects of  life, self-realization, and the Buddhist interpretation of death. <br />The  author also explores the great life force inherent in the universe as it  works in the context of daily human activities. For this he frequently  draws from scientific analysis as well as the traditions of East and West.  He hopes that the reader will rediscover what they are and live in a truly  human way.	2000-03-13

Little documentary evidence remains, but it was in this period  that the religion split into its two major branches, the Maha sanghika and  the Theravada, and spread beyond India to Central Asia and China in the  north and Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia to the south. <br />In Buddhism, The  First Millennium, the author pieces together the fabric of events from the  distant past with insightful conjecture to bring to the surface the basic  pattern of how and why Buddhism came to be a major world  religion--spreading into Southeast Asia, China, Korea and Japan--helped  along by exceptional rulers like the Indian king Ashoka and the Greek  philosopher-king Menander and monks and lay believers like Vimalakirti,  Nargarjuna and Vasubandu. <br />The author shows the relevance of the teaching  and spirit of the Buddha, not only to Indian society as it was then, but to  the world and humankind as they are now.	2000-03-13

Both are absolute  pacifists. A timely publication at a critical juncture in world affairs,  this book is the product of their discussions held at Soka University, Los  Angeles, in 1987.<br />While the dialogue spells out their efforts and  prescriptions for dealing with the current peace issues, it also relates  Pauling's recollections of his childhood, his development as a scientist,  and many episodes about his life and the people he has known--Albert  Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer among them. This volume gives a broad and  personal glimpse of Pauling, recipient of two unshared Nobel Prizes (1954  for chemistry and 1962 for peace).<br />Dr. Pauling first met Mr. Ikeda in Los  Angeles in 1987, then again in 1990 and twice in 1993, before his death in  1994. His son, Linus Pauling, Jr., later recollected his father's pride in  their joint publication, as follows: &quot;My father met President Ikeda in  his later days and mentioned him to me on many occasions, but I was  particularly struck by the fact that in my father's office, at the time I  started working there, which was in late 1991, there was a stack of books:  the book on peace published by President Ikeda and my father, A Lifelong  Quest for Peace. I noticed that my father tended to pass out a copy of this  book to distinguished visitors who came to see him, and I think that he had  considerable pride in participating with President Ikeda on this book.  President Ikeda and my father were complementary in many ways.... My  father, coming from his scientific background that dealt with facts and  statistics, and President Ikeda with his philosophical training dealing  with concepts, managed to come together, bringing these two viewpoints to a  mutual understanding, an understanding that lay within each of them.&quot;<br />A Lifelong Quest for Peace, gives the reader an opportunity to become  acquainted with Dr. Pauling, who was always active and vocal in his  advocacy of responsible and humane progress in science and a superb role  model for today's young people, on whose shoulders the problems of the  twenty-first century rest.	2000-03-13

After hearing Tina Turner speak about her Buddhist practice in interviews, and hearing her  give credit to Buddhism for her happiness and in life, I decided to look  further into it myself.<br />Tina mentioned Daisaku Ikeda as the person who  brought Nichiren Daishonin's Buddhism, the practice of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,  to America.  This is the Buddhist practice to which Tina attributes her  spiritual fulfillment and strength.  Thanks to Tina's explanations, I was  able to locate the Soka Gakkai International and from there I discovered  many profound, inspirational and educational writings by Daisaku Ikeda.

He went on to establish the  forerunner of Soka Gakkai in 1930.  The Soka Gakkai International is now  the largest Buddhist organization in the world, with over 12 million  members in 128 nations. <br />Mr. Makiguchi believed that Japanese education,  far from creating a democratic society of responsible, independent  citizens, turned most youths into morally and socially irresponsible  automatons. In fact, he blamed education for many social ills and agonized  over the force-feeding of information to students. He professed that  students must experience happiness, even at school, and that education  should be relevant to their lives. <br />As the book outlines his inspiring  philosophy and revolutionary proposals, one can well appreciate his basic  argument that education ought to engage interest. <br />This translation is a  joint effort by Dayle M. Bethel and Alfred Birnbaum. It has been called a  milestone by concerned parents and educators and, as such, it seems  appropriate for those nations in which social mores seem to be eroding,  especially among the young.	2000-03-13

The English version includes selections from the first twenty-eight of these to create a single gripping  book.<br />This is not an attempt to plead a national cause; the editors  clearly realize that the horror of war knows no nationality. They have been  able to persuade the contributors to this volume of one fundamental truth,  which is the core of the Buddhism in which they believe: that suffering is  born from ignorance. In the hope of dispelling the ignorance of the young  about what war really is, these victims have consented to relive their  tragic experiences and commit them to paper. Their hope is that this  knowledge, once shared, will help to prevent a repeat of the most senseless  and savage of all human activities.	2000-03-13

I found this book after seeing a Larry King Live interview with Tina Turner in which she discusses her life and the Buddhist practice she credits with helping turning her life around, Soka Gakkai.  This book is  the most inspirational life-story of a living person I've ever read!   <br />I've since read and re-read this book a few times, as well as other  books that are related to the Buddhism she practices.  At first, it was  hard for me to believe someone like Tina could also be a Buddhist, but now  that I've read more about it I completely understand.<br />I'm so glad Tina  mentioned Soka Gakkai and Daisaku Ikeda in the interview, because she  didn't directly discuss them in this book.  I also found the BEST book  about Tina's Buddhism at Amazon.co.uk, which I highly recommend - it's  called &quot;The Buddha in Daily Life&quot; by Richard Causton.<br />Tina is  the greatest!  A true rock and roll Buddhist Goddess!     Nam-myoho-renge-kyo...	2000-03-12

The  result of their ongoing dialogue is &quot;Human Values in a Changing  World,&quot; one of the best books I've ever read.<br />In a series of  conversations in this book, they explore a wide range of issues including  sexuality, religion, morality, non-violence, suicide, capital punishment,  nationalism and so on.  <br />Like all good conversations, the interplay of  ideas sometimes takes unusual turns and unexpected leaps, and any  preconceptions about the attitudes of, on the one hand, the  enthusiastically acclaimed leader of a vigorous mass movement and, on the  other, a university teacher will be swiftly exploded.<br />Hard issues are not  dodged, nor are unpopulare opinions glossed over.  &quot;Human Values in a  Changing World&quot; gives an inspiring example of the ways in which people  from totally different social, religious and cultural traditions can talk  constructively in a sustained endeavor to make sense of problems that must  be resolved if their shared hope of a more civilized and humane world is to  be brought into being.	2000-03-08

What is the secret of its vigor some three thousand years after the death of its founder, Shakyamuni?  This book, &quot;The Living Buddha, An Interpretive Biography&quot; seeks  to answer that question.<br />Surely essential to a full understanding of the  continuing impact of this teaching is a knowledge and appreciation of the  life and personality of Shakyamuni himself.  <br />Unlike most major  religions, Buddhism depends neither on divine revelation nor an incarnation  of God for its authenticity.  Shakyamuni, the Buddha or &quot;Enlightened  One&quot; was a man who through his own efforts attained enlightenment as  to the essential nature of life itself.  And for this very reason, his life  story is meaningful to us today.<br />&quot;The Living Buddha&quot; is a  biography with a double focus.  On the one hand, it is a vivid historical  narrative based on what is known of Shakyamuni's life and times.  One the  other hand, it is the inspiring account of a heroic life dedicated to  helping all people free themselves from suffering and futility and attain  true peace of mind.<br />In this book, exquisitely written by world-renowned  author Daisaku Ikeda, Shakyamuni Buddha emerges as the amazing man he was.   Yet, he was only a man; not some superhuman deity, just a man who attained  a state of life that, according to his own teachings, is inherent in every  one of us.  Therein lies his true greatness.<br />Through this book, we see  that Shakyamuni Buddha lived in a turbulent period and was confronted with  the same kinds of social conflicts and personal problems that we all face.   The description of how he conquered these obstacles is what makes for an  engrossing and inspiring account, and one that is highly relevant to our  lives in these modern times.<br />The author, Daisaku Ikeda, as leader of the  world's largest Buddhist organization, Soka Gakkai International, brings  unique qualifications to this portrait of Buddha.  With this book, as with  all of his writings, Mr. Ikeda has once again contributed a profoundly  useful tool to those in pursuit of greater Buddhist knowledge.	2000-03-08

He bases his poetry on the belief that respect for the ultimate dignity of  life itself is the spiritual basis of world peace, which he has worked to  construct since his youth in war-torn Japan.<br />The heroes of these poems  struggle in their daily lives and win, building happiness for themselves  and their countries, thereby leading step by step to world peace.  Mr.  Ikeda, a prize-winning author, has recorded in vivid language their  spiritual and worldly struggles, and the glory of their eventual victories  through their practice of Buddhism.<br />Daisaku Ikeda is the president of  Soka Gakkai International (SGI), the world's largest Buddhist organization,  with over 12 million members in 128 nations.  He is the author of dozens of  award-winning books, translated into over a dozen languages, and is a  recipient of the United Nations Peace Award.  He has also been awarded the  title of Japan's Poet Laureate.	2000-03-08

Through the story of their meeting, and their interaction, &quot;Kanta and the Deer&quot; teaches children  about living in harmony with nature, respect for animals, the spirit of  living with courage and hope, and the rewards of never giving up no matter  how strong one's obstacles.  <br />This beautifully illustrated little book is  both heart-warming and heart-wrenching.  Both you and your kids will love  it!  This book, as with all great children's books, is equally enriching  for both the young and the not-so-young alike.<br />I recommend this and all  of Daisaku Ikeda's award-winning children's books - especially The Princess  and the Moon.	2000-03-08

It is essentially a dialogue between Chandra Wickramasinghe, an internationally renowned astronomer, and Daisaku Ikeda, leader of Soka  Gakkai International, the world's largest Buddhist organization.<br />In this  dialogue, the two men probe some of the deepest aspects of our existence.   They touch on everything from Religion to Near-Death Experiences to Nuclear  Weapons to AIDS to the Big Bang Theory and more.  <br />As the dialogue  unfolds, both the Buddhist viewpoint and an astronomer's view of the world  are expressed, side by side, with interesting comparisons between the  two.<br />While at first sight Buddhist philosophy might seem to lack the  advantages of the empirical methodology of science in its exploration of  the physical world, Buddhism's treatment of psychology, including the idea  of many states of consciousness, appears to be remarkably sophisticated in  modern terms.<br />This book also shows how ancient Buddhist ideas of  cosmology are in tune with modern scientific thoeries.  Fascinating through  and through.	2000-03-08
