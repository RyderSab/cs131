US	53036520	R3EFLP7GQSB5UE	0446614548	630563961	Bride Needs Groom	Books	2	1	5	N	Y	Disappointing	The book shipped early from amazon.com and arrived September 17.  It's only worth reading if you became a Chickalini family fan from prior books.  The author is still having serious problems with the internal time line.  In \\"Once upon a Blind Date,\\" Dominic Chickalini was 28.  Now he is not quite 30, but Maggie and Charlie, who married at the end of the prior book, have children who are four and two, and another baby born in the course of this book.  Meanwhile, Dom's sister Nina and her husband Joe who had baby Rose in \\"The Nine Month Plan,\\" now have Rose as a ten-year-old.  At that time, Dom had just graduated from college, so if Rose is now ten, he ought to be 32. <br /> <br />Aside from those and similar nuisances which are calculated to drive the reader nuts, the heroine is a cypher, Dom is obnoxious, and the ending is contrived. <br /> <br />Maybe that should have been one star.	2005-09-18

From a purely romance perspective, the book is a satisfying read.  The main problem is timing in the backstory.  The heroine, a physician, has been \\"away\\" for years, whereas the hero, a veterinarian, has been \\"home\\" in the small town where they grew up.  This seems to leave out of consideration that the education needed to produce a veterinarian is just as long and strenuous as that needed to produce a physician, so that - logically - he must have been away himself a minimum of seven or eight years before returning home to open his practice and can't have been back for more than six years (given the ages assigned to them), no matter how a reader tries to stretch it.	2005-08-13

The heroine is 31.  Supposedly, rather than marry the hero right after college graduation ten years previously, she had received a job offer from a law firm in Boston and taken it.  However, law school takes three years after college graduation.  Then there's the little matter of taking the Bar exam. <br /> <br />If neither the author nor the editor had caught anything so blatantly wrong, then probably the rest of the story isn't worth the effort of reading it.	2005-08-12

The topic, a romance between an American/Israeli woman and a man who has discovered that he is the grandson of a Nazi war criminal has an interesting subject matter.  The characters involved, however, do not really grip the reader's attention.  The story does \\"date\\" itself quickly.  At the time it was written, the war criminal who had hidden out in South America was in his late 80s by the time he was discovered, and mentally not competent to stand trial. <br /> <br />By 2005, with the passage of time, one practically has to read the book as a \\"historical\\" romance rather than as a \\"contemporary\\" romance.	2005-07-25

The problem isn't so much in the plot, which is stereotyped but expectable, as in the author's sublime ability to ignore reality as far as the background situation goes.  No, I'm not talking about the coincidence of the carved roses.  I'm talking about the idea that a newly discovered codicil to a will, four and a half years after the completion of probate, could be enforced by a family lawyer without going back to court.  I'm talking about the idea that if a farm is to go to a benevolent association of the heiress does not produce a child by her thirtieth birthday, that the same lawyer could sign it over to the association - then and there, with no further formalities -  just because she tells him she isn't pregnant as of nine months before her thirtieth birthday. <br /> <br />Maybe the author never heard of premature children?  At a minimum, given that she was married, she had two more months of being able to try to get pregnant before he could do anything irrevocable. <br /> <br />Most of the rest of the setting is equally bad. <br /> <br />The proper rating is not one star.

There are a few echoes of one of Johnson's earlier books, _Woman in Blue_, but only in a few sentences about the relationship of Renee Patton to her deceased father in the earlier book and the relationship of Ann Caldwell to her late father in this one.  Otherwise, the plots of the two books are distinct, granted the overall requirement that the hero and heroine of a romance need to fall in love.  This plot, especially the unveiling of problems within the department in which the two cops work, is fresh and original. <br />     One minor distracting aspect is that there are some things the proof-reader should have caught (\\"different than\\" rather than \\"different from\\"; \\"until death do they part\\" rather than \\"until death do them part\\").  The sense that the ending is rushed causes the reader somewhat more difficulty.  The author set up several scenes that then were not written, possibly because she was running against the word limits for the series. <br />     Those minor nits aside, both the working relationship of Juan Diaz and Ann Caldwell as partners and their growing personal relationship, as it complicates their work, strike realistic notes.  The background characters (family, friends, co-workers) are genuine rather than caricatures.  Caldwell and Diaz, who also appeared as minor characters in Johnson's earlier book _Mommy Said Goodbye_ deal with complexities. <br />     It's a worthwhile book, above and beyond the romance genre.	2005-05-22

While it has an inspiration stemming from the aftermath of the Roman withdrawal from Britain, it is &quot;Arthurian&quot; only in the sense that Guy Gavriel Kay's &quot;Sailing to Sarantium&quot; is Byzantine.  It's not a retelling of either history or legend.  Rather, it is the creation of a different society (as in the dramatically different status of women from that of the historical European early Middle Ages), a different religion (the religion of the White God has many parallels to Christianity, but they are not exact), and a different set of developments, with only loose parallels to the original.<br />From my personal perspective, the most refreshing aspect was the absence of a Merlin-figure and the author's heroic restraint from turning the queen, Elenn, into Guinevere.  Overall, there is refreshingly little romanticism.<br />The voice of the writer, that of Sulien, is that of an elderly (very elderly, age 93) woman looking backwards.  The style is an excellent approximation of late Latin chronicles.  There is violence, there is heroism, and there is also, praises be, a high valuation placed on common sense and practicality.<br />The ending leaves open the possibility of a sequel.

Rather, it is a novel set in a world which is clearly analogous to that of the Byzantine Empire, but in which the theology differs (it has heresies, but the faith is not historical Christianity) and the events differ (OTL history has nothing equivalent to the marriage of Gisel and Leontes), but some of the conflicts (such as the iconoclastic controversy) are played out in a similar manner.  I would be inclined to say that the more a reader knows about Byzantine history, the more impressed he or she will be by the alternative that Kay has constructed.<br />Overall, the most interesting aspect of the novels is in their setting the perspective from that of a creative artist (the Barbarian invasions seen from the perspective of their inconvenient impact on the supply of good-quality tesserae for constructing mosaics).  The intensely focused nature of the viewpoint is a remarkably accurate reflection of the single-minded artistic focus, and the degree to which it can, temporarily, be laid aside.<br />The writing is complex.  There are a lot of characters to track.  Kay makes a rather uncompromising demand that the reader pay attention and that the reader remember.  These are not novels for the lazy.  They are very rewarding for a person willing to expend some effort.	2000-10-24

Some are apparently designed to hype the importance of the cast of characters -- for example, the idea that Susan McCulloch &quot;discovered&quot; Zara Ciscoe Brough on the  Hassanamisco Nipmuc reservation in Grafton, Massachusetts, when the  reservation there had held an annual Indian fair open to the public since  at least the 1920's, with newspaper coverage, etc. The genealogical errors  are worse.  Benedict attempts to trace the Western or Mashantucket Pequot  lineage of the current membership.  However, he first states that the  paternal-line ancestor of many members, Cyrus George, was  &quot;Black,&quot; ignoring that both Cyrus and his parents were on the  Connecticut State overseers' reports as Western Pequot regularly through  the 19th century.  He then states that Martha Hoxie, Cyrus' wife, was  possibly Indian, but Narragansett, by misidentifying her mother, Jane  Grant, as the same person as Mary Jane Grant.  Jane was descended from  Betsy and Caroline Wheeler, who also appeared on both Connecticut  overseer's reports and Federal census records in the 19th century as  Western Pequot.  Based on these serious factual errors, he contends that  the current tribe has no connection to the historical tribe.  His  assertions are simply mistaken.  Documents that have long been open to  public research refute them.	2000-05-05

Gordon-Reed paid  little attention to the sensationalism that accompanied many of the  statements concerning the liaison (such as those which asserted that  Jefferson had sold his children).  By ignoring how overblown some of the  attacks were, she makes it harder to understand why several of Jefferson's  defenders, such as Dabney, rejected the entire body of allegations.	1998-11-23

Suitable for most fantasy fans from  age 10 up, and even educational for the younger ones, who will have to look  up some of the Official Management Terms in the dictionary.  Some parents  of younger readers may have concerns about a few entries, but even the GAY  MAGE entry (Lackey) is written primarily in terms of aromatherapy.	1998-11-14

That said,  it doesn't work as a novel.  One wants to suggest to the author that he  work from an outline, and go back to such basics as the beginning, the  middle, and the end, with a discernable plot.  By this 8th book of the  series, he has so many irons in his fire that no one of the themes is  advanced very far toward a conclusion, and tracking what each of the  characters has done in the past and is doing is now has become a very  complex undertaking (even for a professional historian who does this sort  of thing for a living).  I suggest a relational database cross-referencing  characters and events from one book to another.	1998-10-26

While  one could probably extrapolate a bit on the Rheba/Bren outcome, since I  have a sf interest I am particularly interested in the future development  of the Bahrain Construct which keeps reconstructing itself with crystals as  the series progresses.	1998-09-06

If there were fewer than one stars, this book would get it. It's the &quot;classic English expatriate&quot; novel (in the model of The Rains Came, etc.) but set in the middle of an interstellar war: even with a member of the British royal family. The fighting is a rip-off of David Drake; you're better off with Drake.	1998-09-06

There are evil and  good gods; the racial mix is human and non-human; the contest between DARK  and LIGHT has been going on for a thousand years or more.  The book just  seems to last that long when you are reading it.  This is sort of a pity,  because the central character, Mortecai, really is appealing in spite of  being the standardized street urchin turned reformed thief.	1998-08-23

Each of the &quot;short stories&quot; is long enough for a meaningful theme.  The elderly Catholic titular queen of Carinthia's summary of the history of the Reformation alone is worth the price of the book, as Dr. Calvin flees from France to Germany, changes his name to Luther, is thrown out by the local ruler, goes to Switzerland, changes his name to Zwingli, and that's why the Switzers have to come to France to be confirmed.	1998-06-28

The situation (humans stranded on an alien planet) could be very stereotyped, but it isn't.  The personalities of the individual aliens (within the parameters of their own biology) are developed as clearly as those of the humans.  For a change, the humans act with reasonable intelligence.	1998-06-06

I like all of Turtledove's alternate history/alternate universe writing (well-researched) but in this one he has the best description of the frustrations of trying to work in a federal regulatory agency I have ever seen--the shortage of resources, the sleazebags and bottom feeders out there, etc.  And it's fun	1997-08-09

For people whose roots are from the Carolina Piedmont through east Texas, and between Louisville and the Gulf Coast.  It's heavier on really southern names than Upper South names.  Funny but not mean.  I went to grade school and church with these names when I was a child.  Features the adventures of Fern, Vern, and their bowling trophies, among other &quot;real&quot; meanings of names	1997-08-09
