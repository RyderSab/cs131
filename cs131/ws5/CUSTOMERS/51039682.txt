Martha was young once but we tend never to think about that when we do think of her.  She is best remembered in portraits of her that were executed when she was rather elderly & matronly.<br />In this book, we meet the young & vibrant Martha.  We learn what her life was like even before she met George Washington.  Martha was indeed, considered quite a catch & very lovely in her youth.  She was a wealthy & independant young widow when George first met her.<br />In her middle years, she gave George Washington what he needed so that he could pursue the agenda of building a new country from scratch.  Martha was his equal partner in marriage & life.  They shared a deep abiding love & respect for one another.<br />As with many women of her time, Martha's life revolved around family & friends, birth & death, celebrations & defeats.  Through them all she comported herself admirably to the approbation of almost everyone who knew her.  She set the standards for First Lady because she was the FIRST.<br />This book also gives us a detailed look into the lives of the Virginia Tidewater society and their views on slavery & daily life.  Martha never came to think that slavery was wrong, to her it was just a fact of life.  In his will, George set his slaves free (upon Martha's death).  It is still difficult to comprehend the thinking that taxation without representation was wrong & considered a reason to fight for freedom but slavery was considered acceptable.  Why was it okay to fight for your freedom while at the same time maintaining the right to own & sell people's children away from them,never to be seen again?  Martha & George had many heartbreaking instances of wrenching death in their families but they weren't able to equate their devastation with the evils perpetrated on families by slavery.<br />The book gives us a fascinating insight into the society of Colonial Williamsburg at it's zenith. It is also a fascinating glimpse into the personal daily life of a woman of that time.  We learn a different slant on how occurances led up to the Revolutionary Way & the Declaration of Independance, as well as the Constituion.<br />We follow Martha & George through their times of separation & sacrifice, as George became the head of our Revolutionary Forces & then as a two-term President of the United States.  Together, they created their jobs through a criteria of what was best for the fledgling country.  In doing so, they relied on one another for strength & courage.<br />I loved reading this book & intend to continue reading books by this author.  I hope there are many more to come.ascinating glimpse into the personal daily life of a woman of that time.

This humble autobiography by George Beverly Shea the great Gospel singer who has withstood the test of time well into the 21st Century is an inspirational story of how one man let his life be led by God and through his remarkable Faith became one of the most treasured voices in Christian music of our time.  Those of us who have been privileged enough to hear him, whether in person, on the radio, or on a record, find that his voice & his message resonate in our hearts.  You cannot hear him without coming away changed in some way.  GBS used his voice for the Lord & the Lord has truly blessed us by using him as His instrument.<br />On a short personal note, my Grandmother told this story many times; one summer Sunday afternoon in the 1950's, after church, my Nana was sitting in her living room with the front door & all of the windows open.  She was playing her George Beverly Shea records.  Someone knocked on her door & when my grandmother answered, the woman at the door said, \\"I'm visiting in the neighborhood & I heard your record player, that's my brother you are listening to, do you mind if I come in and listen with you for a while?\\"  Of course, my Nana invited her in & they sat & shared a lunch & that glorious voice.<br />George Beverly Shea, literally, can bring you to your knees......and isn't that the purpose of his wonderful gift?	2005-09-23

Knowing that the leading cause of death in pregnant women is murder, you have to wonder why this particular case commanded so much of the public's attention; on the other hand, I wonder why that equally shocking statistic hasn't done so as well.  This case it what it took to shine some light on that apallingly ugly truth.<br /><br />If you are looking for some insight into Scott Peterson, there is none here nor is there any into his fascinating & puzzling parents.<br /><br />If you wonder why the public's attention was captured you need only to look upon the charismatic & smiling faces of the two people most involved, Scott & Laci.  Then remember that Laci was 8 months pregnant & that it was Christmas & you have a story that holds the utmost fascination, that of a Christmas tableau gone horribly wrong.<br /><br />I imagine that Scott never realized that the story would take on a life of it's own & that he would become entangled in it & the public's fascination with it.  If he hoped Laci & the baby would soon be forgotten as a \\"cold case\\", he was very mistaken & is now paying for his cold-hearted crime by residing on death row awaiting execution.  His parents are paying too, for the way they treated their \\"golden boy\\" and covered or dismissed his every miscalculated move.  They are paying financially & emotionally & have to live with Scott's actions & their reactions to them.  Many of the things they said during the course of the search for Laci & then the trial are just now brought to light in this book. Their son bankrupted them in more ways than one.<br /><br />Laci's family carries a double burden too; they've been deprived of their daughter & their unborn grandson by a cruel & selfish murder.  You heart breaks for them & their family & the knowledge & the doubt that they will carry for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />There are a few things in this book that have not been revealed before & they are of intetrest.  If you hadn't followed this case on a daily basis & known most of what was happening as it occurred, then you might want to read this book to \\"come up to speed\\".  Just don't expect to come away from reading this book with understanding & comprehension; it's just not there.t was happening as it occurred, then you might want to read this book to \\"come up to speed\\".

This book is a fascinating treatise of how we use our intuitive mind to make snap judgements.  The author takes us into situations where our mind can lead us to places we had no idea it inhabited.  We get a graphic look at how unconsciously we are prejudiced and why we react the way we do to certain people, colors, tastes, animals & inanimate objects.<br /><br />You will see clearly how you are manipulated by the marketing industry all the way back to the original marketing concepts of \\"Imperial Margarine\\" & \\"the Pepsi Challenge\\".  The material is surprsing and will help you gain insight into how marketing affects our everyday choices.  You can clearly understand how marketing affects children who are exposed to hours & hours of TV ads from infancy to adulthood.<br /><br />You come to understand that it is possible to educate your mind (ie: hone your skills) so that you can enhance your power of snap judgements, intuitions, \\"thin slicing\\", face recognition etc. to react in a rational manner to situations.<br /><br />When I first began reading this book, I thought to myself that it would make it would make a perfect companion to Gavin de Becker's book, THE GIFT OF FEAR, & I was right because Mr. Gladwell, the author of this book, begins to quote examples from Mr. de Becker's book on page 230.<br /><br />The last chapter of this book lays bare the erroneous thought that we have the ability to judge based solely on what we see and hear.  Rather that we are uncounsciously programmmed by subtle & not so subtle prejudices picked up from our families & the world around us.  If we can educate ourselves to set these thoughts aside, we might just see how much we are missing.	2005-08-15

Adriana Trigiani (God, I just love to say her name and the names of all of the characters in this book!) has given us all a precious gift.  If laughter is indeed the best medicine, I am laughing myself into splendid good health.<br />Bartolemeo di Crespi, a very talented interior decorator, who adores what he does for a living & has decorated every home in town, has had a life long dream to bring new beauty to his family's local church.  Our Lady of Fatima is due for a renovation and Bartolemeo gets the job, although he is the second choice of the Catholic church board.  They wanted a pretigeous firm from Philadelphia instead.<br />Since Bartolemeo of the House of B gets the job (underwritten by the richest woman in New Jersey) he begins a quest that is sprinkled with swatches, recipes, invitations to dinner and delicious stories of the amazingly hilarious and all too human characters in his extended Italian family.  He travels into the rarefied circles of New York interior design, the cathedrals of Italy and the artistic temperament of those who work in historic restoration.  As he does, he meets fascinating new people who will help him and he in turn, introduces us to all of the crazy and delicious members of his inner circle of family and friends.  Each one of them is a story unto him/herself.<br />This story is about people who inhabit a small area of New Jersey and since I'd lived there all my life until I moved to California two years ago, I adored reading about my home state.  Thanks to Ms. Trigiani for mentioning Voltaco's in Ocean City; the greatest sub shop in the world.

Put them aside for a day or two while you read this book, for Lauren Bacall let's you see inside her PERSON; she shares an intimate portrait of a life.  She will be the first one to admit the luck (and gratitude)she feels, to have shared her life & enduring friendship with people who to all of us are only icons.  As with her own life, her friends are those whom we've only glimpsed in their public personnas.  We have seen them and devoured their movies and their \\"private life\\" in the arena of the world press.<br />Lauren Bacall shares her life, her fears, her triumphs, loves and friends with you in a setting so personal, so intimate, that you feel you actually share a kinship with them as you read this autobiography.  That is the great thing about this book.  She puts herself out there for you to care about or not, she offers no apologies for any choices she has made.<br />From the time she was a small child growing up in New York, Betty (her real name) knew she wanted to be an actress.  She was the child of an immigrant family from Romania and an American father who was absent from her life totally, to all intents and purposes.  Her mother tried to love her enough to make up for any lack on his part, and her mother's family were devoted to loving and caring for her too.  So surrounded by love but little in the way of worldy goods, she turned to her inner strength and her imagination.  Some of that inner strength came from not having a father, but knowing he was \\"out there somewhere\\", but did not care about her, some of it came for the poverty and want she experienced in her childhood.  Both her reserves of inner strength and determination would serve her well throughout her entire life to the present day.  She is now 80 years old as this book ends and very much her own strong and inspirational woman.<br />She was \\"discovered\\" by Howard Hawks who saw her modeling in an ad for the Red Cross which ended up on the cover of Harper's Bazaar Magazine.  As was the case in those days of the studio system, she was brought to Hollywood and groomed to portray a certain kind of woman, a fantasy of Howard Hawk's design.  No one really cared back then, who you really were on the inside, they tried to mold you into a hot commodity.  Bacall, an innocent, had entered into the \\"star system\\" of glamourous & smoldering sexuality and contractual servitude.<br />In the same sort of way as what happened to Orson Welles, her first picture thrust her into the straosphere of stardom on the screen and into the imagination of the American people.  She reached a pinnacle while still in her youth.  Yet Lauren Bacall managed to make for herself a lasting and lifetime career of spectacular achievement, not even dreamed possible by female actresses of the time from that luminous beginning.  She is still making films, has starred on Broadway & stages of the world (both in musicals and dramas), acted on live television, appeared in mini-series', and written a remarkable book.  In her tenacity she will try anything (despite her fears and insecurities) and that attitude has served her very well.<br />Before going to Hollywood, she had put herself \\"out there\\" countless times in her attempts to make her dreams & ambitions become reality.  She had the courage to try anything and to put herself in the right place at the right time.  Well before she ever was brought to Hollywood, she made what would be some of the most lasting friendships (and connections) in her life.  She knew Burgess Meredith, John Carradine, Diana Vreeland, George S. Kaufman and many, many others from those golden days of Broadway in New York.  They shared a mutual respect for one another, trusted one another and loved their chosen vocation.<br />During the making of her first movie, she met and fell in love with Humphrey Bogart.  He was married at the time to a self destructive and viciously jealous alcoholic (who died after Bogart & Bacall were married).  Bogart was resigned to spending the rest of his life in a loveless marriage with this woman because he felt her owed it to her to stick it out, no matter what.<br />Although surrounded by true friends, Bogart hungered for a more fulfilling life.  When he fell in love with Bacall, he could not help himself from feeling that she was what he needed to fill the emptiness his personal life had become.<br />Lauren Bacall writes honestly and lyrically about their love and their life together.  She marries Bogie and gives him a home and children and all the love he could ever need.  He gives her a life of undreamed glamour and luxury and entree' to a world she'd only fantasized about.  He shares honestly with her his way of dealing with those who wish to use you toward their own ends.  He teaches her the \\"ropes\\".  He lives in honesty and pragmatism.  She learns survival from him. Their marriage was a meeting of two forces of life; they fought and drank (he did) and loved and settled down together to make a home.  Bogart finally seemed to have it all; the love of a woman he adored and considered his equal, two beautiful children, and a welcoming home that was always open to friends and family.<br />Their 10+ years together are the stuff of Hollywoood legend but beneath that legend, that hype, Bacall lets us really see into their home and their relationship.  She lets us share in Bogart's courage and the heartbreak of his decline and his death<br />She let's us see what happens when they find out that Bogart has cancer.  (It's so interesting to read now of how little there was available back then in the field of medicine and how lucky we are to be livng in this age of rapidly emerging medical research).  Back then, cancer was almost always a death sentence, no one ever came right out and said that out loud though.  Cancer also carried a stigma in those days and it was kept quiet.  Bogart did not feel that way about it.  Together they bravely fought it with whatever the medical world could offer (little) and also let the world know he had it.  It could have ruined his career but we'll never know.  He and Lauren Bacall fought the good fight and lost.  Bogart became an enduring legend.  Lauren Bacall had to move on and fashion a life for herself.  In order to do that, she had to move away from being identified as \\"Mrs. Humphrey Bogart\\".  If she couldn't do that, she would live in his shadow forever.  She took the treasure of what would be the greatest love of her life and carried on toward her own fulfillment as an actress and a woman.<br />On page 303 of her book, Ms. Bacall says, \\" I want whoever reads these words to have a sense of Bogie-what he was, the personal mark he left on many varied lives\\".  Her portrait of him is so successful on that front that you feel her loss (and that of everyone else who loved him) acutely.<br />After the death of Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall is left a widow with two small children and a $500,000 legacy.  What she does with her life from here on out is of her own sense of determination and guts.<br />Although the book was written more than 25 years ago and recently reissued with another chapter of her life since then, it remains fresh and fascinating.  You will find her inspirational and accessable.  I read the book the first time it came out those many years ago and read it again this time with just as much relevence, joy and anticipation.

I read this book right through in one sitting, because I could not bear to put it down.  This story will make a wonderful \\"chick-flick\\" and the only person beside Candice Bergan that I can picture playing the courageous Betta is Elizabeth Berg herself; just look at her photo in the back of the book.<br /><br />Betta Nolan, a published writer of children's stories, has just lost her beloved husband John.  He was only fifty-eight years old and he had died of liver cancer.  As his dying wish, John wants Betta to find a small town, buy a home there, and begin a new life.<br /><br />Betta sells their home on exclusive Beacon Hill in Boston for far more money than she ever dreamed it was worth.  After distributing her husbands ashes in places that were meaningful to them both, she sets out to find her \\"place\\".  Betta searches for a kind of town where time has seemingly stood still.  The town she's wants has children playing outside, people strolling around, a feeling of hominess and charm.  She finds such a town in Stewart, Illinois.<br /><br />As she drives around the town looking at it, she sees a \\"for sale\\" sign on an old Victorian home.  It seems to be the perfect home for a new life to begin in.  Excited, she gets out of her car and goes up the walk to look inside (if no one is there).  Through the windows, she discovers a treasure trove of Victorian detail, stained glass and charm and decides to call the realtor.  The realtor, Delores Hinckley, meets Betta at the house and shows her through.  Betta is enthralled and knows instantly that this is the house & town where she wants to begin to live again.<br /><br />The home belongs to Lydia Samuels, a ninety-five year old woman who now resides in a local nursing home.  Lydia is sour on life and people and makes it very difficult for anyone to care about her.  Delores tells Betta that she must meet with Lydia's approval in order to buy the house.  When they meet, Lydia does make things difficult but Betta prevails and buys the house.<br /><br />Once Betta moves into the house, things begin to change for her and for some of the people in the small town.<br /><br />Betta is going to meet people who will enhance her life and people who will be changed by knowing her.  After Delores and Lydia, the next person to enter Betta's new life is Benny, a little boy who likes Dr. Pepper and choclate chip cookies and lives next door.<br /><br />Betta begins to reminisce about her old college dormmates.  They were all extremely close until she left college and met John.  After that, it seemed to be that just the two of them were sufficient to fill the needs of one another and she drifted away from her old friends.<br /><br />Betta decides to try and find them again and suceeds in finding one.  Luckily, that one woman knows where the others are and they make plans to get together.<br /><br />Betta's life begins to open up in unexpected and powerful new ways as she renews old friendships and makes new ones in her new hometown.<br /><br />Betta even finds the key to reaching Lydia and manages to make her life less lonely too.<br /><br />Betta's dream is to open a shop in town called \\"What a Woman Wants'.  She knows exactly what she'll have in it to offer her cutomers (she and John had planned and dreamed about it together)and how it would enrich everyone's life, including hers.  As she makes plans to begin this new venture, she solidifies her relationship with her college roommates and the firends she makes in the town.

What do you say about a book you love so much that you've read it three times?  Johnathon Hull has written a true treasure in this his first book.  I hope you will treasure it too & you will have learned so much.  I can't wait to read this author's next book.<br />Patrick Delany has lived a life told in three interconnecting time frames;  First as a young man who marched away to war in the patriotic fervor of World War One. Daniel calls it \\"peer pressure that has gone berserk\\". As you read his moving narrative, you will come to an understanding of what war really means for the men who fight it.  Is there glory in battle?  Patrick ponders and answers the question eloquently and graphically.  You may never look at war the same way again and that's not a bad thing.<br />The one good thing about Patrick's experience in the demoralizing trenches of France is that he meets and forges a bond of brotherhood with the men of his squad but most of all with Daniel Mac Guire.  Daniel is a first generation American son of staunchly Irish Catholic parents.  Daniel has fallen deeply in love with a young woman of another faith.  His parents disapprove adamantly of his choice.  Daniel is so in love with Julia that he sees her despite his parents' feelings.  One day Daniel & Julia run away together and from that day onward, his parents turn their backs on him.  Julia is a loner, an artist who was brought up in the school of hard knocks but she seems able to find great beauty and meaning in everyday things.  Her letters to Daniel at the Front are filled with longing and life.  As he hears Daniel read them aloud, Patrick falls secretly in love with Julia.  One day, shortly after arriving in France, Daniel receives a letter in which Julia tells him she is ecstatically pregnant.  Daniel is thrilled too and worried at the same time for Julia will be pregnant and deliver her child all alone.  Although Daniel is consumed with worry for her he is also filled with joy.  He truly has something to live for and will have his little family to return to when the war is over.<br />The second thread of the story line begins as France remembers those lost in battle and the veterans who fought there by dedicating a memorial to them 10 years after the end of the war.<br />Patrick returns to France with his wife and small son.  His wife is not interested in \\"rehashing\\" the war at all so she and her son go their own way in Paris and Patrick goes to the memorial services telling his wife he'll be gone for 6 days.<br />Patrick goes with hope in his heart; hope that Julia may be there too.  Patrick looked for her after he returned home from the war but to no avail.  He never even learned her last name.  As the ceremonies end, and after a moment of silence, Patrick opens his eyes and sees Julia.  He has never seen a picture of her but he knew her from Daniel's descriptions; he knew exactly what she'd look like.  He'd dreamed of her a thousand times.<br />Julia recognized Daniel too and they both felt as if they'd always known one another.<br />Patrick and Julia spend an unforgettable two weeks together in France retracing the steps of Patrick and Daniel as they fought the war.  Along the way, their attachment to one another deepens and Patrrick begins to regret his marriage.  He still loves Julia as much as he always did even when he was only sharing the words of her letters to Daniel.<br />In the third thread of the story, Patrick is an old man who lives in a nursing home and is dying of stomach cancer.  He is still very much \\"with it\\" though and reminisces often, calling on those poignant memories from so long ago.  He finds strength in trying to recreate Julia's face on paper but he never seems to quite be able to capture her totally to his satisfaction.<br />Patrick again, eloquently, yet realisically describes what it means to live your life in a nursing home.  He also lets you know that although you may see an old man when you look at him, deeply banked and sheltered fires still burn in him.  He is richly alive in the fantasy parallel universe of his brain and his libido.  He is not what you think of when you see an old man.  Maybe no old people are what we think of when we see them. Patrick helps us to realize that.<br />One day a package arrives for Patrick and it's unexpected contents lead Patrick on his last quest to the battlefields of his youth and to a meeting that will change two lives.richly alive in the fantasy parallel universe of his brain and his libido.

I love how her mind works and I think I've found a kindred spirit in her.  Sarah convinces friends and family members to accompany her as she retraces the footsteps of little known (in this day & age) histories regarding the assassination of Presidents of the US.  In the course of her macbre tourism she unearths fascinating glimpses into the lives of both the assassin and the assassinated.  She adores trivia and seemingly carries an endless trove of factoids in her head.  She is able to pull these facts out at will as she travels from one historical marker to another historical shrine.  Deeply entrenched in all of the stories told in this tale, the common thread of coincidence unwinds, and as in \\"six degrees of separation from Kevin Bacon\\", she thrills us with formerly unknown connections.  The most fascinating of these connections is the appearance of Abraham Lincoln's only surviving son, Robert Todd Lincoln, at all of the assassination dramas that occurred in his lifetime.<br /><br />I loved this book so much and now that I've discovered Sarah Vowell I will read all her others.	2005-07-08

He seemingly just mysteriously went \\"missing\\" one day from the agricultural commune where he lived and worked and no one who knew him had any idea where he had gone.  They conjectured that maybe wild anmials had dragged him away or that a whirlwind picked him up, but not one person could say for sure.  Mma Ramotswe works partly by feeling and intuition and she feels she may be able to discover what occurred all those many years ago just by travelling to the spot and gathering the vibes of the spirits that may still be there.  In any event, Mma Ramotswe wants to help the American woman gain some (I really hate this word) closure.  Mma Ramotswe has also lost a child and understands the deep heartache such a loss brings.<br />Interspersed within this story of her detective work is the fact of her romance with kindly gentleman Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and her acceptance of his marriage proposal.  Upon her acceptance of this proposal and diamond engagement ring, she doesn't realize that she sets in motion a plan by his maid to do away with her, the woman the maid views as detrimental to her own plans to dominate Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni and his household.<br />Mma Ramotswe also promotes her trusted secretary to the position of Assistant Detective (while still maintaining her duties as secretary) and she begins to shine as an investigator in her own right.  Soon she saves the day for her first client.<br />Add into all of this the fact that Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is coerced into agreeing to adopt two orphans before their wedding without telling Precious and you will find that you will love the characters in this book and anxiously await reading the next one.	2005-07-08

As she says, \\"nobody can be that uptight and pious without trouble going on underneath\\"!<br /><br />Julia's concern for Hazel Marie heightens after Lillian, the housekeeper, receives a cryptic phone call from Hazel Marie.

He went as a reporter and came back as a man on a mission.  His mission was to honor a generation of men & women who responded bravely to their personal calls to duty.<br /><br />This book was written, not so much by Mr. Brokaw, as it was by the men & women who lived during this time.  As Captain Joe Foss, a Marine F-4 Wildcat fighter pilot, who participated in the fierce battle for Guadalcanal would say, \\"those of us who lived have to represent those of us who didn't make it\\".  Mr. Foss is himself, the recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor.<br /><br />THE GREATEST GENERATION bears witness to the young men & women who gave up their youth in order to sacrifice themselves & their own ambitions to the cause of a greater good.  In the course of serving the effort to win WWII, their everyday acts of bravery & heroism changed the course of the society & the world.  This is not to say, that everyone involved in the war effort acted honorably towards one another;  Mr. Brokaw shines a light on little known acts of hatred & prejudice that continued on despite the premise that we were fighting a war against an enemy that had destructive racial policies of it's own in place.  So, in some places & times, as always, the cream did not rise to the top, and the better nature of people did not appear to show blacks, the Japanese, Hispanics, American Indians & women the way to a new world unfettered by racism & crushing prejudice.  They fought for the country they loved, nontheless.  These men & women forged on in the only system that was known to them and in the process, made life better for all of us.  They gave birth to ideas that would serve as instuments for change in society, some of which we would not see come to the fullness of fruition even in our own lifetimes.<br /><br />Mr. Brokaw invites you to get to know them and realize how the world we live in today came to be shaped by everyday, ordinary young people.  They were children during the Great Depression and youths in their teens and twenties when they answered the call, in a wave of unparalled patriotism brought on by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the banded together and fought a battle to victory against an enemy bent on destroying the world as we know it.  They were loved & revered by those in the countries they liberated.  They were baptized by blood & fire, they were forged into steel, then they returned home, to their families and resumed their lives.

In a moment of weakness she has agreed to sign a lease on some \\"useless\\" acreage she owns outside of town.  The man to whom she signs over control of this property is Dwayne Dooley.  Mr. Dooley tells Julia that the Lord \\"has laid it on him\\" to build a theme park depicting the milestones in the life of Jesus.  He's going to call it \\"the \\"Walk Where Jesus Walked Christian Theme Park\\", better known as WWJW.<br /><br />Julia's decision to lease the property meets with hostility from her Presbyterian minister, Larry Ledbetter.  Rev. Ledbetter doesn't think that this kind of thing is the proper way to represent the life of Jesus.  Pastor Ledbetter, however, seems to think almost everything Julia does is improper or scandalous and one has to ask why she would remain a member of this church after all the times he's tried to undermine Julia's best of intentions.  Why he even conspired with a psychiatrist once to have Julia declared imcompetant after her husband Wesley Lloyd died and left his entire fortune to her.  Pastor Ledbetter was of the belief that Wesley Lloyd's intent had been to leave all his money to the church and he intended to see that it happened just that way.<br /><br />Shortly after Julia signed the lease to Dwayne Dooley, the town once again becomes enmeshed in a hotbed of gossip and scandal, some of which Julia finds directed toward her.

Score another one for MISS JULIA HITS THE ROAD.  Ann B. Ross has created a delightful cast of characters who reside in a small town where everybody knows your business.  This book is the 4th in a series, and I hope Ms. Ross never quits writing the ongoing saga of Miss Julia and her fellow townspeople.<br />Miss Julia herself, shares a home with her deceased husband's mistress and Little Lloyd, the offspring of that laison.  Julia had finally settled in and was enjoying the independence of her widowhood from the dominating and miserly Wesley Lloyd Springer.  Wesley Lloyd's demise has left Julia unexpectedly wealthy and owner of half the town's real estate to her great joy, for as long as he was alive, the parsimonious Wesley Lloyd acted as if they didn't have a dime to spare.<br />The second surprise came a short while after the demise of that straight-laced and upstanding citizen Wesley Lloyd Springer.  Who was about to turn up on Miss Julia's doorstep, but Hazel Marie and her son \\"Little LLoyd\\"?!!  Hazel Marie had the birth certificate that proved Julia's philandering husband was the legitimate father of Little Wesley Lloyd, Jr.<br />Some time after Julia \\"got used to the idea\\" of it all, Hazel Marie & \\"Little Lloyd\\" came to live with her.<br />Julia's treasured friend, confidante and long-time housekeeper & cook, Miss Lillian lives in another part of town but is at Julia's house daily where she doles out endless cups of coffee, delicious cakes & pies, and scrumptious meals to the little family & the friends who drop by.<br />Suddenly, the normally talkative and opinionated Lillian, becomes quiter and seems withdrawn.  Julia tries to figure out what's going on but Lillian is keeping her problem close to the vest, whatever it is. In her straight-foward way, when Julia can stand the suspense no longer, she sits down and pratically demands that Lillian tell whatever the problem is so they can get it all out in the open and move on to solve it, if possible.<br />Some problems, it seems, are much more easily solved than others.  Miss Lillian's problem at first does appear to be insurmountable.  Clarence Gibbs, the owner of the street on which she and most of her nieghbors have resided their entire lives (and their landlord) wants to evict all of the tenants on Willow Street then bulldoze their homes so that he can build a bottling plant that taps into a natural spring on the property.

As usual I devour this author's books in one day; she'll never be able to keep up with me!<br /><br />Celia Kellog thought she'd put her past behind her.  She's promised her adoptive parents and her dying husband that she'd never reveal the secret of her childhood.<br /><br />She'd started life with another name, Liza Barton.  Seven year old Liza's life is idyllic.  She and her parents live in a lovely old mansion in the horse country of NJ and in the historic town of Mendham (a short commute to NYC) and she has everything a child could want.  One day, her father is suddenly killed in a horseback riding accident.  Liza's life changes forever and without her beloved father, she's not the carefree child she was or ever will be again.<br /><br />Wealthy builder Ted Cartwright and her mother have now married but things have not gone well.  Liza does not want a relationship with Ted as her stepfather, she only wants her daddy back.  Ted scares Liza and she never feels comfortable with him in the house.<br /><br />Finally after a series of drunken or abusive events with Ted toward Liza's mother, Audrey Barton Cartwright demands that he leave and says she wants a divorce.<br /><br />Liza feels the tension in the house increase though, because Ted keeps trying to get Audrey to take him back and his behavior borders on stalking.  Both Audrey and Liza are terrified of him now.<br /><br />One night, Liza hears the voices of Ted & her mother shouting in her mother's sitting room.  In a state of fear, Liza goes and gets her father's gun.  She wants to threaten Ted with it to get him to leave them alone. She enters the sitting room and while pointing the gun at him screams at Ted, \\"let go of my mother\\".  Ted does just that, and as he let's go of Audrey, he pushes her violently towards Liza.  Audrey crashes into Liza with so much force that the gun goes off.  Liza has shot her own mother,; then the gun goes off again and again striking Ted.  Audrey dies in Liza's arms while Ted lying wounded across the room dials 911.<br /><br />Ted accuses Liza of trying to kill him and her mother because she hated them both for marrying after her father's death. The police take her away.<br /><br />After months spent in a catatonic state, Liza is finally deemed fit to be tried in juvenile court.  Every one in town has seemed to turn against the little girl who has lost everything.  She trusts no one, not even her court appointed attorney. She is, however found not guilty.  The town folk do not agree with the verdict.  Some people start to equate Liza with Lizzie Borden.  They even call her home \\"Little Lizzie's Place\\", so both Liza and her lovely home are stigmatized.<br /><br />After the trial is over, Liza is adopted by some distant relatives, who take her to another state and change her name to Celia Kellog.  Liza now has to forget who she really is and live a new life with a new identity.  She has to live with the knowledge that she killed her own mother.<br /><br />Celia eventually grows into a lovely young woman.  She falls in love with an older wealthy man and they have a son Jack.  Her husband dies while Jack is a toddler.  He makes Celia promise never to reveal who she really is because he fears that Jack will be stimatized by the notoriety of the case.<br /><br />Celia is able to keep her promise to Jack's father and her adoptive parents.  Eventually, Celia falls in love with sweet and handsome Alex Nolan.  Alex and Jack become best buddies too and Celia is touched by Alex's care and concern for them both.<br /><br />Celia and Alex marry when Jack is 3 1/2.  After they've been married for about six months the couple make plans to take Jack to see a horse show in Peapack, NJbut Alex has a surprise up his sleeve for Celia.  As a birthday gift, he has bought her a beautiful old mansion in Mendham, NJ.  Imagine Celia's horror as Alex pulls the car up in front of the same home where Celia/Liza had killed her own mother 24 year ago.<br /><br />Celia cannot just come out and tell her new husband about her history with this house.  She can't explain in front of her little son.  She promised never to tell anyone.<br /><br />Alex can tell that Celia is less than pleased, but is it just because he bought a house without telling her about it?<br /><br />Reluctantly, Celia moves into the house but almost immediately someone vandalizes the mansion and grounds and names the house again as \\"Little Lizzie's\\".<br /><br />After that, the speculations of the townspeople run rampant and the bodies begin to fall.<br /><br />You will meet some pretty amazing characters along the way and you will love the journey to the truth that this story takes you on.day gift, he has bought her a beautiful old mansion in Mendham, NJ.

His is one of those ubiquitous faces in TV and film.  He's a character actor who is so believable that you forget he's acting.  He has appeared in the landscape of our lives while crafting his remarkable characters in many of our favorite TV series'.  In fact, I saw him on Law & Order the night before I found this book.  I never knew, though, that Ron was also a playwrite.<br />Ron has written a wonderful first novel and a story that is a tribute to everyman and everman's family.  He spins a tale of your next-door neighbors, your relatives, people you know; people who've heroically picked up their own lives and moved on in the midst of great pain and misfortune.  Ron's characters are flawed human beings who are never able reach their full potential.<br />Smithson \\"Smithy\\" Ide is an obese beer guzzling, chain smoking 43 year old man.  Locked in a dead end job in quality control at a toy factory and thinking his life is as empty as his stark apartment, Smithy has given up.  He used to be slender and athletic.  He used to not care if he ate, he used to run everywhere, that is until his parents gave him his trusty & treasured Raleigh bike one day in 1958.<br />Smithy believes that one reason his parents bought him the bike was so he could aid them in the search for their mentally ill(schizophrenic) daughter whenever she disappeared, which was often.  Bethany, Smithy and his parents were a cohesive family unit; all they had was each other and they cared for each other as best they could.  Bethany was the beautiful light of their lives when she was born.  As she grew, Bethany began to exhibit a wierd behavior. She would stand frozen in exagerated poses for extended periods of time.  Then she began to take her clothes off in public and then freeze in poses for long periods of time.  She started to speak of hearing voices.<br />Every time she'd disappear, Smithy on his bike and his parents in their car would formulate a search plan and go looking for her.  When they'd find her they'd bring her home.<br />They tried to get help for her, they even tried commiting her, but nothing really helped because Bethany could appear to be as normal as you or me, while under observation.  She lied to her therapists.  Bethany could go for extended periods of time seemingly normal and then just turn on a dime.  Eventually, as a young woman she'd disappear altogether for good.<br />Enmeshed in these circumstances, Smithy spent his young life and teen-age years.  He was always worried about his sister and always afraid that someone would take advantage of Bethany in her naked and frozen state.<br />The time came when Smithy was inducted into the Army and he got away from home for the first time.  You'd think being shot 21 times in \\"Nam\\" and spending months recovering in the hospital might have given him pause for positive change.  Considering his life was saved and he'd never had to actually participate in a battle, Smithy thought of himself as lucky.  How did he manage to get shot 21 times?  The VC heard him peeing in a swamp and just unloaded their guns at him.  Smithy never had to shoot at anyone.<br />He returns from the hospital recovered from his wounds and the posessor of a Purple Heart.  He tries to commence with the life he sort of dreamed he'd have someday.  Nothing worked out though, and he found himself locked into a dead end job and dead end life.  He allowed himself to become fat and drunk and unattractive.  He became a lonely couch potato.<br />In 1990. after living many years of his life in this vegetative state, one day both of his parents are killed in a car crash.  As Smithy prepares for their funerals he discovers a letter from the Coroner of Los Angles in his parents' mail.  The paper confirms that the body of Bethany now lies in a morgue there awating further instructions.  It seems that Mr. Ide had been sending Bethany's dental records all over the country for years in fear of confirming the worst; that she had died far from home.<br />Without a reason in the world to stay where he is, Smithy jumps on his trusty Raleigh bike and pedals out of town to a favorite childhood fishing spot.  He never returns home that night and, instead, without making a conscious decison to do so, starts out on a quest.<br />Smithy Ide rides his bike all the way to Venice Beach, CA and the funeral home where his sister's body lies waitng.  Along the way, he meets interesting people who have also led lives of hidden sorrow, he relives his past and the unconscious choices he's made, he reevaluates his life, and he loses weight.  Most importantly, he makes contact with an old friend from his childhood.  This friend has lived next door to his parents all along.  She's in a wheelchair, permanently paralyzed, and isolated in her home.  She has always loved Smithy.

This book is number one of a series of seven (so far) Miss Julia stories.  There's something wonderful about these authors from North & South Carolina that pushes all my buttons.  I am never sorry when I choose one of their books.<br />There's something wonderful about Southern women as heroines of their own lives that gets you interested in them and keeps you interested in them.  This story introduces Miss Julia, a recetly widowed woman who finds her life has changed in unexpected ways; changes that lead her to believe that she is going to be enjoying her new life from here on out instead of pining away for her dearly departed.  Miss Julia, having lived under the thumb of her penny pinching husband Wesley LLoyd Springer for forty-four years, discovers upon his death that Wesley LLoyd was not only a millionaire but owned half of the town where they lived their whole married life.  Liberated by the discovery of the wealth she had no idea existed (Wesley doled out money to her in fifty dollar increments, with admonishments about profligate spending), Julia now is able to live a life of ease.  She thinks she will no longer have a thing to worry about.<br />Also being liberated for the first time in forty-four years, are Miss Julia's brain and her opinions and her ideas and her personality.  Her husband had always told her what to think, how to do things, how to keep up appearances.  Both Julia & Lloyd were respected pillars of their communities who were united in Wesley Lloyd's ideas of how a good Christian life should be lived.<br />Without warning, Julia's widowhood is once again, turned upside down with the appearance of a young woman and a nine year old boy on her front porch.  The young woman informs Julia that the little boy is Wesley LLoyd's illegitmate son and she has the birth certificate to prove it.  She abruptly announces that she is leaving the boy with Miss Julia (who never had any children of her own) while she goes to school to learn to do \\"nails\\".  Her reason, she says is because his daddy is dead now & he didn't even leave them the house they had ben living in, let alone any money.  The mother, Hazel Marie Puckett, seems to think Miss Julia won't mind, cause she's \\"kinda like the boy's stepmother in a way\\".<br />Miss Julia in her astonishment, watches as Hazel Marie kisses her little boy on the head, says \\"mind Miz Springer now, you hear\\" and then bounds into a car that speeds off down the road.<br />A rollicking good read follows as Miss Julia tries to decide how she going to keep her head up around town when everyone hears about her husband's child \\"from the other side of the sheets\\".  Miss Julia is afraid that everyone in town will think she's been a fool when they find out about Wesley Lloyd's love child.<br />Pretty soon it become quite evident that much of the town knew anyway and never spoke of it to protect her.  Despite her obvious humiliation she decides to present the truth to the town, fait accompli, and just march into the barber shop with the boy.<br />Along the way, she, the boy and Julia's housekeeper Lillian, become involved with a televangelist out to take the boy away from her so he can find out if the boy has any money, the minister of Julia's own church who thinks the money should have been left to his building fund, a doctor who wants to help have Julia declared incompetant, people who talk of suing her, a kidnapping, an assault on the boy's mother, and many other hilarious characters and situations.<br />Julia certainly learns to trust her own instincts by the end of the story and had gained the admiration and respect of Sam, the attorney who had looked after Wesley Lloyd's affairs for many years.  She builds a life for herself, the little boy, and his mother that is far more fulfilling than she has ever experienced before.announces that she is leaving the boy with Miss Julia (who never had any children of her own) while she goes to school to learn to do \\"nails\\".

Campbell is a lonely man; left bereft by a life that has passed him by.  He began his journey as an infant abandoned on the church steps; his only conceivable identity provided by the can of Campbell's soup that accompanied him.  His first name, Oswald was merely given to him because it was next on the list at St. Joseph's Home for Boys where he was taken and raised.  The T was for tomato; that was the kind of soup it was.<br /><br />Oswald feels that he was never given the privilege of sharing in the good things that bring joy to any ordinary person's life.  Nothing ever came easy to him.  His response to the emptiness he felt in his soul is to drown it in alcohol and ruin the one chance he had a happiness, his long ago marriage to a sweet & caring woman. He is curently living his solitary life in Chicago at the DeSoto Apartment Hotel for Men.<br /><br />On one of the most bitterly cold & snowy days in recent memory, the final blow comes as Oswald's doctor gives him what amounts to a death sentence and tell him that he most probably will not live past Christmas.<br /><br />The doctor recommends that Oswald leave the bitter wintry environs of Chicago and head south to a better climate; a climate that might make his last months more bearable.

The brochure is one that the doctor's physician father used to hand out to his TB patients.  The town is called Lost River, a place steeped in the quiet pleasures of a time that has seemed to have been forgotten by today's world.<br /><br />Oswald makes a few phone calls & discovers that the old hotel in the brochure burned down a long time ago, 1911 in fact, but he is offered a room in the home of a woman named Betty Kitchen that he can rent for $50.00 a week, inclding board.

This one is a departure from what her fans may have come to expect, but it's still a wonderful story.  If anyone has ever suffered an estrangement, an abandonment, disappointment in another, or blindness to another's flaws, and who hasn't; this book is for you.  You will be able to relate to these characters and empathize with them.<br /><br />  The story begins on an tiny idyllic island off the coast of Greece.  Five tourists in search of answers to problems in their own lives and who do not know one another share a night of tragedy in a small taverna.<br /><br />  The owner of the taverna, Andreas, who was born on the island and has lived there all of his life, is also scarred by the long ago loss of his only son after a bitter argument drove them apart and the son left for Chicago.<br /><br /> As they all start to eat & drink in the taverna high on a hill, a tragedy begins to unfold in the sea below them.  A boat that takes tourists out for evening sight-seeing cruises around the island, burns and then explodes.  They watch through borrowed binoculars, helpless, as the horrific scene plays itself out.  They see people struggling in the water, they see the rescue attempts, they see it all.  They are all the more mesmerized by the terrible event knowing that it could have been any of them on that boat that night too.<br /><br />  The owner of the boat ,Manos, is a friend of Andreas' since his childhood.  He and other life-long residents of the island die that night along with many of the tourists.<br /><br />  The island and it's people will be changed forever by the accident and their loss, along with an Irish expatriate, Vonnie, who has lived there most her life seeking redemption for her past.<br /><br />The tourists in the taverna, want to try to find some way to share in their grief and help in the aftermath.  What they do then, and the gesture they make creates a bond between them and the island's inhabitants.<br /><br />  The scope of the tragedy makes it newsworthy and the next day, TV news crews from around the world converge on the tiny island in the sea to report the grim story.<br /><br />  Those of the tourists who fear their families might think that they too were on the boat that fateful night, reach out and contact their homes.  This small act and other acts of reaching out, combined with their desire to be a part of the days of mourning on the island that follow, change the dynamic of their lives and the lives if the islanders.<br /><br />  What follows is a satisfactory and engaging story of how that change plays out in the lives of the tourists and the islanders as they learn more and more about one another and become bonded by their shared grief and the circumstances of their individual lives.  They all become friends to not just themselves but to the people of the island; no longer just tourists from different continents.  By bonding and sharing, they are able to set in motion far reaching changes in the lives of themselves and others.e tragedy makes it newsworthy and the next day, TV news crews from around the world converge on the tiny island in the sea to report the grim story. <br />  Those of the tourists who fear their families might think that they too were on the boat that fateful night, reach out and contact their homes.

Although Julia finds her self the widow of a man who betrayed her in a very tangible, visible way during their 40 year marriage, she sucks it in and makes the most of an unexpected turn of events that eventually enriches her life.<br />  Julia finds herself being relentlessly courted by the handsome retired lawyer who manages to sweep her off her feet in a moment of self percieved weakness one night.  She lets him persuade her to head off to Pigeon Forge, TN for a quickie wedding in a 24 hour chapel.<br />  Julia & her handsome new husband spend their honeymoon in Dollywood enjoying the privileges their marital status now allows.<br />  Shortly after arriving back home, it is brought to Julia's attention that the wedding may have not been legal; that the \\"minister\\" who performed the ceremony may not have been licensed.  These facts are now published in a nationwide \\"scandal sheet\\".  It seems as if a famous Country & Western singing star also was married in that same chapel by that very same minister and the tabloids are having a field day.<br />  Julia, being the pillar of the community she believes herself to be is appalled at the idea that she & her new husband have been enjoying marital relations without benefit of clergy & sanction of state.<br />  She begs her husband to set out on a quest to discover the truth, while she remains at home & tries to keep their \\"secret\\" from being discovered by her friends & townfolks.<br />  What happens from there on out, coupled with a beauty pageant being run in her town & under the auspices of the police department spins out into a delightful yarn as Julia discovers just how much she really loves her new husband and just how far she is willing to go to prove her love in order to bind him to her.<br />  Both story lines combine to play out in a very satisfactory final episode where everyone gets what they rightfully deserveisfactory final episode where everyone gets what they rightfully deserve	2005-05-18

It is from the creator of \\"Ten Little Ladybugs\\".  It is imaginative and beautifully illustrated.  The cover sparks anticipation to look further into the book. The book of course, begins with \\"ten little fairies\\" and the story leads down to \\"one tiny fairy\\" but the lovely & delightful surprise at the end of the book is that all ten fairies return in a dream with their fairy wands actually twinkling.  Little girls will love this book and it would be a wonderful birthday party gift!	2005-05-08

(Boynton on Board)	Books	5	0	0	N	N	Bedtime Rhythms	All of Sandra Boynton's children's books are charmingly illustrated and very enjoyable to read.  This book, PAJAMA TIME is written in such a way that you can make it sound all the more humorous to young children by establishing a rhythmic delivery that will make the child giggle & want to join in the fun. My 3 year old granddaughter loves to hear this book and asks for it over & over.  It's the perfect short story before bedtime, although usually I find that when you read a child one Sandra Boynton book she is going to want to hear another & another; they're just that much fun!	2004-07-26

This person still does not seem to understand the  gravity of the situation she helped to cause, namely, the impeachment of  the President of the U.S. and the betrayal of his friends, family,  constituants and collegues.  All she does is whine about the treatment that  she was subjected to as a result of her tawdry fling.  She still misses her  \\"Handsome\\", the man who used and manipulated her and then  discarded her like yesterday's newspaper.  One has to wonder what it would  take for this girl to get the picture that all the men she's known so far  have used her for one thing only and yet, she inexplicably longs for them  and remembers them fondly.  Monica needs to find some way for men to relate  to her other than her \\"comfortable sexuality.\\"  Monica is a very  beautiful girl who is not fat and undesirable.  Her opinion of herself is  seriously flawed.  She needs to impose a vow of chastity upon herself  before she destroys any more lives of wives, children and unborn babies.  I  write this review as a pro-choice advocate and a person who can no longer  stand to look upon the face of Bill Clinton.  I think Monica should learn a  lesson from Joe Di Maggio and just keep it to herself.  I, for one, would  not like to travel the length and beadth of the earth being known only as  \\"the queen of the BJ\\". This book did not change my perception of  her one bit.	1999-05-14
