Well written, well researched.  Now I want to read a bio of Emily Dickinson. <br /> <br />It made a lot of people angry?  Too bad! <br /> <br />Sad to see that, although Dorie Olds, Mark Hofmann's ex wife, has moved on with her life in many ways, she still clings to both the delusion that Hofmann did not commit the murders and a religion that keeps women submissive and in the dark about the real world. <br /> <br />The cover of the book says \\"bizarre beliefs\\" - absolutely. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book.	2005-07-14

I wasn't impressed with him then and I sure wasn't after reading about his work in the Beard trial. <br /> <br />This guy doesn't know where anyone would find marijuana in a college town like Austin? <br /> <br />Celeste had her problems growing up, I'm sure, but the woman is just not likeable and I really don't understand why any man would go ga ga over her.  I also can't believe how Steve Beard would \\"hook up\\" with another woman so soon after his wife of many years died (let the body get cold, for Pete's sake).   <br /> <br />And why DO these grossly overweight, unattractive, wealthy older men PERSIST in the delusion that bimbos half their age are interested in them FOR THEM?   <br /> <br />I felt for the twins.  Imagine having someone like Celeste for a mother!  I also felt sorry for Tracey Tarelton.  She was badly used by Celeste, who is a textbook predator.	2005-07-14

His mother, after all, did spoil her son shamelessly.  No wonder he thought he could do anything he wanted to any woman he wanted whenever he wanted. <br /> <br />JoAnn Williams helped to break up a marriage.  She got a man who cheated on his first wife.  Did she expect him to magically change?  And why didn't she just go ahead and get a divorce from Walter?  This is still America - a wife doesn't need permission from her husband to divorce him, particularly if he is committing adultery.  Jim Williams should have done the same: gone the divorce route instead of murdering his wife, Sharon. <br /> <br />All in all, Scottie Priesmeyer does a good job of story-telling.	2005-07-12

Page-turner.  Couldn't put it down!  Christopher McDougall lays bare every lurid detail. <br /> <br />I've seen intrigued by this case since I saw it featured on \\"Dateline\\" in early 2001.   <br /> <br />I became convinced as I read further into the book that Gloria Trevi, too, was a victim of Andrade's abuse and insatiable need for control, but that does not excuse her part in the sickening affair. <br /> <br />Trevi is no feminist icon - not by a long shot. <br /> <br />Sergio Andrade is a pathetic, disgusting excuse for a human being.  He wasn't man enough to deal with adult women so he took advantage of 12 and 13 year olds - CHILDREN. <br /> <br />In September, Ms. Trevi was freed \\"for lack of evidence\\" and she is back in demand.  Interesting to see if she can make up for the lost time - and if she will try to cross over to English-speaking American audiences.  With the oppressive turn this country has taken of late, I don't think her antics will play well in the States.    <br /> <br />Andrade will still be tried for his crimes.  I hope he gets precisely what he deserves.	2004-11-26

Chuck Negron had (and still has) a great voice.<br /><br />However, it gets a little tiresome at times listening to all the excuses for his addiction problems.  Many people had seen their parents divorce. Many others have wound up in foster homes.  Most have not turned to drugs and alcohol.  Most were not multi-millionaires before they hit 30.<br /><br />I have never bought into the \\"disease\\" thing.  Addiction is a weakness and a bad choice.  You choose to take that first drink, first hit, etc.  If you don't, then you don't become addicted. (With all the drug education these days telling you how bad it is, why would you bother?)<br /><br />I've never understood why the people in \\"recovery\\" expect those of us who did what we were supposed to do all along (WITHOUT \\"crutches\\") to fawn all over them and tell them how wonderful they are 24/7 when they finally decide to stop killing themselves?  Don't they think the rest of us have lives of our own?<br /><br />That seems to me what Chuck Negron is doing in this book - constantly looking for a pat on the back.<br /><br />Okay, Chuck - you beat addiction.  What do you want?  A medal?	2004-11-09

I saw a TV show on PBS one night dealing with the 1918 Flu Pandemic.  I found it fascinating and shared it with a couple of my lists.  Several listers began to tell stories their grandparents had told them about people dying of influenza and/or the resulting pneumonia.  Philadelphia had been hit hard by it.  During the week of October 16, 1918, nearly 4,500 people died -- in one week alone.    I was watching C-Span soon after that and author John M. Barry appeared on the show to talk about the book.  I was intrigued and decided to buy it.    The book is wordy and it takes its time in laying the groundwork of the story and the cast of characters involved, but it's well worth sticking with.      All in all, a good \\"serious\\" read.	2004-10-12

There it is entitled \\"Mr. S - The Last Word On Frank Sinatra\\" and I felt dirty after reading it.  Kitty Kelley's book \\"My Way\\" didn't make me feel like that.    I couldn't make up my mind if George Jacobs is a disgruntled former employee still angry about being fired in 1968 (for THE stupidest of reasons) or a man with a major case of denial.  He claims that his job was so \\"great\\" when his employer was a control freak with NO respect for women (and unable to accept any result that wasn't all \\"his way\\").  Jacobs' claims of being able to easily \\"pass\\" for white when every photo in that book indicates otherwise  are downright delusional.     Like I said, I don't know how much of an axe George Jacobs had to grind but I was pretty disgusted with everyone in that book by the time I finished it.    Frank Sinatra was an icon, a great singer, but if you believe the book,he was  NOT a nice person.	2004-10-01

Well, that's Ric Flair. Perhaps the &quot;marks&quot; - the fans who don't know any better - think he's something special; I don't. I never have. I've always felt that Flair, like Hulk Hogan, used his flamboyance to mask his deficiencies inside the squared circle (besides, I've always preferred MY champions to be more dignified, like Bruno Sammartino and, yes, Bret Hart).      Flair has never impressed me much. If you've seen one of his matches, you've seen them all, and his book is very bit as predictable as his wrestling matches. This is an individual who definitely believes his own hype and it amazes me how his fans act as though daring to criticize him and his book is synonymous with spitting on the flag.      You have to be mighty insecure to trash your co-workers like he has and disparage their accomplishments in the business....and more than a little petty.       The remarks made about the way Bret dealt with his brother Owen's death were completely uncalled for and made me wonder if those were Vince McMahon's (and not Ric Flair's) sentiments that were being expressed on that subject.       (Incidentally, I'd like to remind all those Bret-bashers that it's the WWE that won't let that 1997 Atrocity in Montreal fade into history. They are the ones who keep bringing it up at every opportunity. I don't know why - it sure isn't something of which I would be very proud.)       Save your money - and buy Bret's book when it comes out. THAT'S a book that WON'T require Vince McMahon's imprimatur.	2004-07-27

It's a tough one for animal-lovers to read, though.<br />It never ceases to amaze me how the people most convinced that the world should revolve around them are the biggest cyphers imaginable.  Knoller and Noel were no exceptions.   It really infuriated me how they knew these dogs were vicious but did nothing about it (I do not blame the two dogs - I blame the owners, guardians or whatever Knoller and Noel choose to call themselves.  It was their responsibility to discipline Bane and Hera.) Also, I hope that the only way Paul &quot;Cornfed&quot; Schneider will ever leave prison walls behind is in a coffin. He does not belong in society.  To call him an &quot;animal&quot; is an insult to the animal kingdom.<br />Hating to be judgmental, I was really annoyed at how fast the victim's partner replaced her.  Indeed, I wonder if Diane's ashes ever did wind on Sharon's mantel piece.<br />All in all, interesting...fascinating...hard-hitting.  I highly recommend this book.	2004-07-15

He used women and then threw them away like used Kleenex when he tired of them.<br />I hope Wilson does not escape punishment for his crimes: killing two of his own children for financial gain.  How can anyone put a dollar value on a child's life?  What he did was greed at its worst.

She sits there in her parents' multi-million dollar home and speaks badly of the homeless and the poor while she steals money from her boyfriend and later drugs from her job to support her meth habit.  Incidentally, her parents had no problems with putting on the poor mouth and having a Public Defender take up the cause of their precious daughter when it came time for her to pay the piper!<br />And Ralph and Constance Rossum - how pathetic - ultra-right wingers for whom everything was about appearances.  They would have done Greg deVillers a huge favor by allowing their oh so wonderful daughter to pull out of the wedding when she expressed doubts.  But, hey, what would the folks at the country club think?<br /> I can't believe that she would cheat on this handsome, caring young man with a serial adulterer who took off for Australia and left her to face the music alone.<br />I didn't think much of Greg's father, Yves, either.  Dr. deVillers walked out on his wife and three sons, stopped supporting them and refused to pay for his sons' schooling.  Then he thinks he can just show  up at his son's wedding as if nothing happened, as if he'd never abandoned his family. After Greg's murder, he acts as though he's Father Of the Decade - oh, so concerned!   Where was he when his sons were growing up?  <br />I felt so badly for Marie, Greg's mother.  The strain of her son's murder eventually helped kill her so Kristin Rossum is responsible for her death as well.<br />I've enjoyed all of John Glatt's books and this was the best so far!	2004-04-25

What a control freak.  The men she was involved with were WAY too easy going and gave in to her TOO fast.  She needed to hear \\"No, it can't be all YOUR way every time.\\"    And the bit about breast-feeding her sons till they were four or five years old - she needed to get a life and a real job, in that order!  Too much time on her hands.    I'm infuriated she got only ten years for cold-bloodedly shooting Chris Northon in the head after drugging him and using a stun-gun on him.  I hope she never, ever gets her hands on her two sons again before they reach adulthood and they can see her for what she is.    Okay, Chris was wrong for pursuing an affair with a married woman, but that didn't give this she-devil the right to trash his reputation and then murder him.    Then, to add more pain to what she did, she slandered Chris' father, Dick, accusing him of being a pedophile.  She sure got a rude awakening when her second husband refused to say what she wanted him to say at the custody hearing. About time SOME man said \\"no\\" to her demands.    As for her father and brother's \\"reviews\\" of this book - open your eyes, guys!  Look what she's said about her own mother.    She and Diane Downs should be cell-mates.

How selfish!<br />(2)  Why would Theresa Stiles leave her third husband, a good, respectful man who never raised a hand to her or her children, divorce him and go back to Grady Stiles for more of what she'd put up with her first time around?  Sociopaths do NOT change...and Grady Stiles had already gotten away with the murder of his daughter's boyfriend.  He had shown himself capable of murder.  WHY would she chuck a quiet, stable life and make a return trip into hell?<br />(3)  Why did Fred Rosen get involved with the case by giving the prosecution a copy of the wrestling videotape with sound?  Isn't an author supposed to be unbiased?

This was a window into the soul of a spoiled young woman who thought she should have anything she wants to make her happy, never mind if it meant spending her husband into bankruptcy or destroying her children's lives (via her affair with a 12 year old).      She was over 21; if she didn't love Steve Latourneau, she should not have married him.  (Why was she sleeping with someone she didn't love in the first place?)  She definitely should not have gone on having children with a man she didn't love.   Hasn't she ever heard of birth control?    Everytime her friend, Michelle, is interviewed, she acts as if the entire thing was Steve's fault: \\"Oh, he was never her equal, yada yada yada.\\"  (As if she's something great.)   \\"If she had gotten what she was looking for from Steve....blah blah blah.\\"  (So that excuses pedophilia.)      Steve Latourneau is no saint and I do NOT condone adultery, but at least HIS paramours were women his own age.  I'm glad he found someone normal and that he and his children are happy in Alaska.    Like her father, the late John Schmitz, Mary Kay firmly believes that rules simply don't apply to her.  She lives in a dream world; she always will.     Now that she's out of prison, she and Vili have married.  That cute little kid has matured into a very UNattractive young man.  He's also a high school dropout with no job, the last I heard.  I give this 6 months to a year before he tires of a woman twice his age who is more than a little mentally unstable.    I feel sorry for Steve Latourneau and all of Mary Kay's children.  I also feel for Vili's mother who, after a tough time raising her own kids, had to raise her granddaughters as well.       They're the real victims in this, not Mary Kay and/or Vili!	2004-01-08

This guy would've wound up dead or in prison sooner or later.    The perpetrators were equally worthy of contempt.  These kids are totally lacking in morals or ambition.  It's depressing to think that they represent the future of this country.    The parents of these perps are just as guilty.  They allowed their minor kids to drop out of school and not work, while they continued to support them, bought them cars and looked the other way as they used/sold drugs, prostituted themselves, etc.  Ali Willis' parents were unbelievable: they let that girl do whatever she wanted because they were afraid of her tantrums...please!  And SHE has a CHILD?  The poor kid!    Fred and Farah Kent seemed to think their son was some sort of saint, while Marty Puccio's parents seemed too busy to notice that their son was being abused physically and psychologically.    It wasn't Lisa Connelly's weight that boys found unattactive, but her lousy attitude, her slovenliness and her temper tantrums.  I would like to have a dollar for every time she was described in the book as \\"sullen.\\"  She came off as pathetic, willing to stay with someone who abused her both physically and emotionally (and who let his buddy do the same).  I guess when you get down to brass tacks, no guy really respects a girl who doesn't respect herself.  I feel sorry for her daughter by Puccio, Megan.  That kid isn't swimming in a very good gene pool.    The fact that Connelly (and her family) didn't seem to grasp what she had done made me wish I could reach into the book and slap her. She should have gotten the death penalty as well.    I cannot believe that Marty Puccio's death sentence has been commuted to a life sentence.  It appears that the lives of people like him (and Rod Ferrell, the subject of Aphrodite Jones' \\"The Embrace\\") are deemed by the Florida courts to have more value than thanthose of their victims.	2004-01-08

Like many people my age, I vehemently opposed that war but never have I disparaged the people who fought.  <br />Mr. Thigpen should try telling those who've lost brothers, husbands, sons, etc. in Vietnam that it was just a \\"scratch scrimmage\\"!<br />All in all, a good read.

I think that point needs to be made.  <br />It made me sick when I learned that these places were replaced by playgrounds, athletic fields...and housing projects (which we all know bring nothing but crime and drugs to the neighborhoods in which they are built).   The playground that replaced Ronaldson's on 9th Street in South Philadelphia is a dreary, ugly place.  For that, an cemetery dating back to 1827 was uprooted?  The same with Lafayette, across the street from the famous Pat's Steaks,  which was also displaced for a playground!<br />I've wondered many times what the &quot;lost&quot; and long-gone cemeteries like Machpelah, Union, American Mechanics, Olive, etc. looked like.

His parents seemed to be a big part of his problem (anyone who had the temerity to criticize their boy were \\"liars\\" and \\"possessed by the devil\\").<br />Susan White has to be one of the unsympathetic victims I've ever read about.  While I am NOT saying she deserved to be murdered, her behavior was appalling.  This was a woman who was completely out of control, promiscuous and blind as far as her only child was concerned.  All she thought of was money and how she could get ahead in the world, no matter what it took to get there.<br />That said, I am appalled that Kent McGowen was permitted to stalk this woman and her son with impunity for so long.

Wonder WHY!).  <br />Also, I was SO sick and tired of excuses being made for the gun man, crack addict Curtis Rower....poverty, ad nauseam. (Addiction is a choice and he chose to do drugs! ) <br />Where are these defense attorneys' consciences?  I truly believe that some of them would defend Hitler if he could come up with the retainer .<br />I felt sorry for Sara, but she jumped into a second marriage WAY too fast.   There had to be SOME way she could have left abusive, controlling Fred Tokars.  There had to be some divorce attorneys around who didn't want $2,500 up front and charge $175 per hour.   Why didn't she ask her family for the money?<br />And Sara's family....the Ambruskos all need counseling desperately.

Ann Rule has one bad habit of describing people as \\"handsome\\" and \\"beautiful\\" when they are most certainly not!  Michael Farrar was/is geeky-looking, not at all anything to write home about.<br />Although I don't believe he deserved to be poisoned or his kids murdered, he is not a saint.  He seemed more attracted to Debora Green's sports car and her income as a doctor than to her.  He comes off as sex-obsessed (he USED \\"Celeste Walker\\", I think), and his need for \\"order\\" struck me as pathetically anal! He expected an antiseptically neat home with three children around.<br />Moreover, an adulterer is far from a paragon of virtue.  Sorry, but Farrar just struck me as a guy who thinks women (wives or girlfriends) are there to make HIS life wonderful.<br />That said, Ann Rule did her usual job of telling the story and trying to get a handle on what makes someone like Debora Jones Green tick. I think Green was molested as a child, even though she continues to insist her childhood was idyllic. I guess we will never know.	2003-03-15

And any woman who instructs other women to behave like they're braindead and submissive should be ashamed of herself!<br />I understand one of the authors is getting divorced, so &quot;the rules&quot; apparently didn't work very well for HER.	2002-08-25

Wonder why?)<br />I will never understand the ridiculous attitude that being female makes you sub-human and that being born with a uterus means you were born without a brain.	2002-02-08

As the book will reveal, the only thing this loser ever showed &quot;devotion&quot; to was himself.  I find it a mystery that a successful young attorney could be attracted to a fat, lazy, sex-obsessed leech who threw tantrums whenever things didn't go his way.<br />This guy used everybody:  his family, his friends, his wife (who he murdered cold-bloodedly and tried to make the crime look like an accident)...even the stripper he was fooling around with (and who has, thankfully, faded into obscurity).  To him, both marriage and life are a matter of &quot;what's in it for me?&quot;<br />I enjoyed the book, and don't understand why some readers gave it such low marks.	2001-12-31

I cannot believe that the Noes' parish priest told her not to have a tubal ligation because it was a &quot;mortal sin.&quot;  I see: birth control is wrong, but infanticide is okay.<br />I don't care if Marie Noe is 20, 40 or 70.  She belongs in prison.  This woman doesn't deserve any pity.  She never should have had any children!	2001-11-18

My opinion was solidified when I read Ann Rule's book, &quot;Small Sacrifices&quot; in 1983.  <br />Diane Downs is the ultimate sociopath.  It is all about her.  She doesn't care who gets hurt...or killed...just so long as she gets what she wants.  And, to this day, she still believes she can &quot;explain&quot; away her actions and that will make all the difference in the world.  (Hello, Ms. Downs?  Cheryl is still deceased; Danny is still paralyzed. Christie still had years of therapy to recover from her near-fatal injuries. All your half-baked explanations won't change those facts.)<br />I hope this woman never leaves prison alive. Thank heaven she can't have any more children.  Diane Downs is a bad seed who, almost 20 years later, still refuses to admit that she is guilty..or even that she has done anything wrong.  Like all sociopaths, her bad choices in life are everyone else's fault!<br />Pure evil.	2001-11-18

So long as she gets what she wants, she could not possibly care less who gets hurt...or murdered in the process.  The manner in which she brainwashed her two sons and turned them against their paternal grandparents is indicative of the way her sick mind works.<br />Those oh so &quot;god-fearing&quot; friends and neighbors of hers who thought she was SO &quot;righteous&quot; are as bad as she is!<br />I just hope this vampire doesn't find a third man to marry and murder.	2001-11-16

I defy anyone to read this book and not be so affected.    The  second part I was angry and outraged....at the people who destroyed the  blameless school janitor, who blamed the Sisters for not getting the  children out when there was nothing anyone could have done differently, for  the death threats against the priests and nuns at the school.  I was angry  that a new school was planned within days of the fire when the babies and  the nuns killed hadn't even been buried.  I was outraged that the courts  were more concerned about embarassing the archdiocese than bringing the  arsonist to justice.  I was outraged that they would build a new school on  the same site with the same name and not make any mention whatsoever of the  fire and its victims, living and dead.    I was angry that they refused to  allow the victims to talk about it, preferring to sweep it all under the  rug, that there was no counseling, either for them or the firefighters who  were equally traumatized.    I've never had a book affect me so deeply.    Our Lady of Angels is now closed.   I had heard that the School District of Chicago was buying the building from the Archdiocese.      Parochial schools are rapidly fading from America's cities.  Low attendance is one reason, but the millions that the Church has had to pay out due to lawsuits filed by victims of pedophile priests has played a huge part in these changes as well.	2000-08-23
