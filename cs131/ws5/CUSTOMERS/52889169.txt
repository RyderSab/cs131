Bible: Over 500 Recipes	Books	5	2	2	N	N	Really well done	This is an excellent cookbook that covers the great range of possibilities for grilling food.   The recipes are well organized, and the procedures are clearly explained.   Particularly enjoyable are some of Raichlen's side notes that give some of the cultural context around the foods.  This is a fun book that will make it really easy for you to have even more fun with your grill.   <br /> <br />I\\"ve made about a dozen of the dishes in the book and all have turned out great.  The only modifications have been to accommodate personal tastes e.g making something spicier or adding more garlic. <br /> <br />For the reviewers who commented that the recipes are too elaborate or the ingredients too exotic, I can only say \\"get a grip.\\"  There are very few ingredients that aren't easily obtainable, and in those cases Raichlen usually suggests a convenient substitute.   The recipes are really easy to execute, most involve little more than chopping, grinding, waiting for things to marinate, and cooking over the grill. <br /> <br />While the book rightly earns its 5 stars, some may argue that it's more about grilling than Barbeque.  Barbeque, to many, is low and slow cooking over coals with some dishes requiring 8 hours of more of smoking time.  Raichlen's book is mostly about grilling.  Personally... whatever.	2005-08-18

If you're a good experienced player who's looking for a more in depth analysis, this book isn't for you. <br /> <br />Although it's title is a bit much, Krieger's book provides the basics you need to know about the major variations of casino poker (holdem, 7 card stud, and Omaha).  It provides good basic guidance regarding starting hands and the play throughout the game.  The book doesn't exhaust the reader with overly complex  \\"analysis\\" of variations of types of players and situations.  While the better known books (Brunson, Sklansky et al) dive deeper into these areas, most people just need the fundementals that are in this book. <br /> <br />The book doesn't go into the issues tournament play; rather it focuses on the play of individual hands.  There are plenty of good books (Cloutier) about tourney play that anyone who's seriously thinking about them should read. <br /> <br />A few minor issues.  The book is organized a bit awkwardly.  It discusses starting hand play for all types of poker, then middle play for all types etc.  It would be much easier to read if Krieger had grouped all the discussion of Holdem in one section and done the same for Stud and Omaha.  Some of the tables are a bit confusing.  The table showing probabilites of making your hand on the turn or river in the holdem section is rather confusing.  Last, there are several annoying typos in the book which are easy enough to deal with, but shouldn't be there. For example, in the listing playable suited connectors, it doesn't mention suited T-9 and the table showing the playable starting hands has a couple of typos as well.   <br /> <br />Overall, a good intro to casino poker for beginners and home players.	2005-03-07

But it's not supposed to be.  Even though both have the common premise of an author writing about himself while on a journalistic assignment to Las Vegas, their purposes and approach are very different.    Comparing McManus' book to Thompson's doesn't provide insight into either. <br /> <br />As for Fifth Street itself, McManus is at his best when writing as a journalist, even though he seems to take some license with the facts related to Ted Binion's murder.  The juxtaposition of a No-Limit poker tournament and the death of someone who lived without limits is a terrific premise.  The book is best when it sticks to these topics.   <br /> <br />The author's description of the poker tournament becomes fascinating as he finds himself playing at the final table with some of the world's best players.  His descriptions of the thinking process of top poker players and how they interact are insightful and very well written.  But his focus on the tournament detracts from writing about the trial and bringing the two topics together in a common theme.  The book may have been better if he'd lost in the early rounds and kept a broader perspective. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the book becomes about the author's personal life.  But given the putative premise, McManus' diversions to discuss his and his wife's family history, potty training of his children, and other extended diversions, distract from the strength of this book.	2005-02-28

The narrative is clear; the research is thorough; and the analysis is first rate.  Books of this type are often painfully dry; however, the author relates the history and provides his analysis in an easy and compelling manner.  It's not a Grisham thriller, but you will keep reading until the end. <br /> <br />While the Cooper Union speech doesn't reach the emotional heights of the Gettysburg Address or the Second Inaugural speech, it is still masterful rhetoric that achieves all of its key goals - shoot down Douglas' arguement against federal authority to limit the expansion of slavery to the territories; provide a unifying theme for the Republican party; and, allow Lincoln to present himself as a leading spokesman for the new party.  <br /> <br /> It's not clear if Lincoln seriously entertained pursuit of the  presidential nomination prior to the speech, but the overwhelmingly positive reaction to it either prompted him to consider it, or removed any lingering reluctance he had. <br /> <br />Holzer's account is in three logical parts - the setup (how Lincoln was invited to speak, the preparation for the speaking engagement itself; and the preparation of the speech); the speech itself; and, the aftermath which led up to him becoming president. <br /> <br />In addition to descriptions of the events surrounding the speech, the book provides an excellent discussion of the context of the circumstances and insight into its meaning.  Holzer provides a good overview of the rhetorical devices as well as the logic used by Lincoln so that the reader learns why the speech was so effective.	2005-02-09

The recipes here are valuable for their insight on technique, pairings of tastes and textures, and approach to cuisine.  A few can be made by the reasonably capable home cook. <br /> <br />For someone looking for a 'how to\\" book for fancy meals,  The French Laundry Cookbook will be only partly satisfying.  The recipes are long and in many cases, quite complicated.  The reader must understand that food like Keller's requires sometimes exotic ingredients, a great deal of time, and careful attention. <br /> <br />Someone who's looking to learn about how Keller approaches cooking and cuisine will find this book eminently satisfying.  Whether you agree with his approach or not, he makes his message clear.   <br /> <br />The much written-about rabbit anecdote is a gruesome part of the book, and it's not clear why it''s included.  One can find a similar version of this story by the way in co-author Ruhlman's book about his experience in the Culinary Institute of America. <br /> <br />The best parts of this book are some of the techniques embedded in the recipes or mentioned as annotations, and the recipes for some of the components of the larger dishes.  These can be made as side dishes or accompanyments that can be paired with other things.	2005-01-05

Harlan's exotic and quixotic life are facinating and by relying on the subject's own colorful descriptions of his journey's (the only real record available) and by providing only necessary commentary, the reader gets a much better sense of what Harlan was like.<br />Harlan is not a particularly honorable character - he switched allegiences as suited his personal ambitions - but, he had a real sense of morality as regards the treatment of women, slavery etc. Harlan did not have a &quot;white man's burden&quot; view of the Afgan people; he respected their culture and many of their individual leaders as great intellects and rulers. His great ambition to establish himself as a ruler in Afganistan led to fantastic adventures that have no modern equivalent.  A combination of guile, energy, and bravado helped him raise armies, engage with kings and princes, and affect the political landscape of part of the world previously untrammelled by Western Nations.<br />The history of the British intrusion into the area as well as the long standing local regional, tribal and family factions should not be forgotten by modern leaders looking to affect politics there.  Harlan excortiates the British for trying to impose their will on Afganistan instead of building a form of government that includes the many competing factions.  The British lost their hold on Kabul in a tragically bloody manner because they did not bother to understand the political and cultural dynamics of the region.<br />Mcintyre thankfully limits his views on the lessons of history in a reasonable and brief postscript to the biography.  The story of Harlan is instructive without senseless commentary, and through restraint, the messages become clear.	2004-06-07

No milk, no meat, no eggs.  What's intriguing is that the dishes seem like they'll be very tasty and the photographs make them look wonderful. I'm glad that someone is out there pushing the edge of cuisine. But, after reading through Raw, I really understood Mark Twain's comment that Richard Wagner's music &quot;is much better than it sounds.&quot;  <br />A problem with the cookbook is that the many of the recipes are unapproachable.  Either the equipment requirements are beyond what most people have or can afford or the ingredients are so obscure as to be nearly unobtainable. Some of the procedures require several days to execute which is not really a problem per se; however, the process complexity is overdone. Like the Shaker song says &quot;it's a gift to be simple.&quot;<br />The notion that only raw foods are truly good for you is specious at best.  Some vitamins and other nutrients are released by heat; cooking kills potentially dangerous bacteria and germs; and cooking makes some foods easier to digest.<br />Bottom line - a lot of work went into this very creative cookbook.  I'll keep it on my coffee table instead of my kitchen shelf.	2004-05-06

Ms Kamman's book is an exhaustive tome to be sure.  She covers nearly every aspect of European cooking and a few forays into other cuisines as well.  You also have to appreciate the way her personality comes through.  It's not hard to hear her voice guiding you in the kitchen.<br />The recipes are generally clear and the ones I've tested work well.<br />So why only 4 stars?  Mainly it is the indexing.  It is sometimes hard to navigate the book to find what you want.  Unlike the Joy of Cooking which seems designed to be an immediate reference work, Making of a Cook takes more work to find what you're looking for.  <br />Also, there are some surprising ommissions for a book intended primarily for an American readership.  There's virtually nothing on roasting a turkey other than one somewhat odd recipe, and some commentary following the discussion of roasting a chicken.  There's considerable difference between roasting a 4 lb. bird and a 14 lb. one.<br />But, the good stuff is definitely worth the investment of time. The explanations of why certain techniques matter and the recipes themselves make this a must have.	2004-02-17

The second question is answered through a combination of statistics and moving stories about what happens in hospitals where there aren't surgeon's of Mee's caliber.<br />The writing is as good as any first rate mystery or adventure story with the added bonus that it's about a situation that any of us could face.<br />The author doesn't waste colorful adjectives making the stories more compelling.  By explaining the situation in a rather journalistic approach, the character of the surgions, the suspense during the operations, and the impact on the families of the children is grippingly clear.  <br />Ruhlman also accepts the need for the monumental ego of the surgeons who perform these operations which require and exceptional combination of medicine, technical skills, and creativity.  Given that anything short of success means losing a child, having a strong supporting ego is a must.  He points out that the most successful surgeons are the ones that are the most honest with themselves; they refer to surgical failure as having &quot;killed&quot; the patient.  <br />Walk on Water gives due attention to the support team that Dr. Mee and his peers have.  It's important to recognize that the dedication and skill of the physicians' assistants, anesthesiologists, and others are nearly as vital to success as the skills of the surgeon.<br />The author describes the flaws in the health care system using stories of other Ohio hospitals to make his point in a convincing way.  Regionalizing pediatric cardiological care would create concentrations of the few doctors who are the most successful and create a better ssytem of mentoring the next generation of surgeons.<br />While the technical descriptions of the various heart defects can be a bit daunting, they are presented as clearly as could be expected.	2004-01-02

The book is an extended reflective narrative wherein an old man relates his view of betrayal to his former friend who has come for a last visit.<br />Beneath the stilted retelling of the story lies a suppressed passion that is reminiscient of classic Russian novels.  Think Dostoyevksy but not so painfully long.<br />Marai explores the nature of friendship and committment from a great many angles, but somehow the main character never acknowledges the potential for real friendship between a man and a woman.<br />The responses by the main characters to the betrayal are bizarre by modern standards.  There's a real temptation to reach into the novel, slap them and say &quot;get over it.&quot;  <br />Nonetheless, Marai has created a sad, but hypnotic reality, that makes for compelling reading.<br />Sit in front of a fireplace, get a glass of good red wine, sit down and enjoy this book.	2003-02-20

The reason it gets 2 stars instead of one is that it's hard to discuss Lawrence without some fascinating things coming through.<br />First, Asher makes himelf part of the biography.  He discusses his own personal travels in a manner that add absolutely nothing to the reader's understanding.  The final paragraph of the book begins with \\"I.\\"  Further, the frequency and manner in which he interjects himself in the book is highly annoying.<br />Second, there are numerous factual problems with the book.  At one point Asher refers to Turks shooting their rifles at Bedu who are over two miles away.  Even a trained sniper with modern equipment wouldn't take that shot.  Further, his description of Lt. Junor's plane crash is at odds with other accounts.  Asher says the plane erupted in flames even though there are published photos of the crashed plane that show otherwise.  Lastly on this point, Asher doesn't use Tunbridge's writings on Lawrence's days in the RAF as reference material. It's a surprising omission.<br />Third, as other reviewers noted, Asher writes extensively about Lawrence's psyche.  This would be sensible if Asher was either trained in psychology or referenced studies by those who are; unfortunately, neither is the case.  Instead there are a few bibliographical references to works on psychology, but none specific to Lawrence.  Asher's vehement discussion of Lawrence's mother makes the reader wonder whether the author or the subject had the greater maternal relationship issues.<br />Fourth, is Asher's style, or more accurately, styles.  At times he uses the contemporary jargon of British soldiers, whereas at other points he writes in a very stilted manner adding unnecessary Latin phrases to the text.  His best writing is when he's providing background or contextual material such as the discussion of British military actions elsewhere in WWI.<br />Lawrence was one of the most fascinating personalities of the 20th century.  He deserves a much better biography.	2003-02-18

He was both amused and repulsed by the trappings of celebrity that came with his status. Brian makes clear that Einstein was a kind man, a good friend, and a mediocre husband and father.  The same man who labored intently over both scientific and social issues apparently put little effort into his family life. Brian does an excellent job of relating Einstein's family, social, and business world.<br />The 2 areas where this otherwise good biography falls short are the lack of context about Einstien's scientific achievements and the inadequate treatment of his interaction with other leading scientists outside of social and business matters.  To the first matter, the book doesn't address why the theory of relativity mattered.  He explains that it is a different model of the universe than what Newton defined centuries earlier; but, he leaves out any discussion of the impact.  Similarly, the importance Einstein's quest for a unified theory is identified as an activity, but not why it was an important one. Brian never addresses why Einstein resisted Heisenberg's theories with such vehemence and for so long?  The author provides little of Heisenberg, Bohr, or Plank's perspective of Einstein.<br />If you know the science already, this book is an excellent intrduction to the man.  If you only know that Einstein was a &quot;really smart guy,&quot; but not why his contributions mattered, then this is not the book for you.	2002-11-20

Reinhart's excellent book provides a clear discussion of how to make excellent bread.  Not only does he give step-by-step instructions, he explains the chemistry and mechanics of breadmaking.  Reinhart doesn't try to make the book a chemistry text, he covers the important parts in a way that even us non-scientists understand.  The reader really does become his apprentice.<br />Besides the clarity of the text, the book conveys its author's dedication to both the craft of making, and the joy of eating really well made bread.<br />Particularly valuable is the discussion of starters.  Making really good bread generally requires use of some form of prefermenation or starter. Too many other baking books describe the starter making and keeping processes as an odd combination of science and sorcery.  Reinhart makes it clear that it's an undaunting, straightforward thing to do.<br />Unlike so many other cookbooks, the photographs are clear and genuinely useful.<br />This book makes an excellent companion to Bernard Clayton's Complete Bread Baking book.

Wallace (Norton Paperback)	Books	5	26	31	N	N	Facinating Account of the Man Who Was Almost President	This exceptionally well done biography of Henry Wallace tells the story of an unusual man who nearly became president of the US. As Vice-president during FDR's third term, Wallace could easily have become president as Roosevelt's health steadily worsened. Back-room dealings at the Democratic convention in '44, were all that prevented Wallace being VP during FDR's final term.<br />Wallace was a brilliant complex man. Early in his life he developed and promoted hybrid corn that improved the productivity of American (and subsequently world) farmers. He was the real drivers of the recovery of American agriculture during the Depression. Wallace made difficult, often unpopular choices, that had the long term effect of improving the country's agrarian strength. <br />As a politician he was simultaneously naive and crafty. His ability to move controversial New Deal legislation through Congress showed how skilled he could be. His run as a third party candidate for president in 52 demonstrated both his naivte and vanity (a quality he developed late in his life).<br />My only quibble with this book is that it tells very little about what happened to Wallace following his quixotic presidential run. While the remaining 17 years of his life were hardly as eventful as what came before, it certainly merited greater coverage. Don't let this small matter detract from reading this otherwise excellent biography.<br />After reading this biography, one reaches two conclusions: 1) it's probably best that Wallace never became president; as an idealist, he was too often unable to settle for the \\"good\\" instead of his view of the \\"perfect;\\" 2) despite his flaws, Wallace's brilliance and dedication make him seem much greater than anyone on the current political scene regardless of party.	2002-07-10

It's still a decent light read, but somehow Perry loses his way.  <br />The biggest flaw is that the lengthy discussions of intramural squabbling among Mafia families doesn't tie in well with the pursuit of Jane and her charges.  Perry should have either had Jane take advantage of the mutual mistrust among the families, or made it the central thread of a separate book.  Instead, we bounce from the usual cross country hide-and-seek with a series of scenes involving Mafia guys arguing.<br />Perry's shows his strengths in his descriptions of settings, and of some of the characters - notably Bernie Lupus (I can't get over the name) and the young girl Jane is protecting.  But, for the first time, he makes the bad guys seem dull.<br />Having produced so many great stories, I'll forgive him for this one and hope that he returns to his usual form.<br />A good summer read. Or read it on a plane.  Buy the paperback.	2002-06-20

The story is suspenseful (if not altogether plausible) and he again creates interesting multidimensional protagonists.  Like all his books, this one includes extensive descriptive settings so the reader always has a strong physical point of view to accompany the narrative.<br />Some reviewers have had a problem with the ending, but I found it a unique twist. Yes, one must suspend disbelief when reading; but, what fun thriller doesn't require that?  The ending is a bit abrupt; but, you gotta stop the story sometime.<br />This is a great book to read at the beach or while travelling.  It sure helped me pass a couple long train rides.	2002-05-31
US	52889169	R18KN1GUTUB6SK	0394555090	951161016	Theodore Rex	Books	4	30	36	N	N	Just as good as it's predecessor	Morris follows up with another excellent biography.  On the plus side is his extensive coverage of Roosevelt's presidency.  He shows clearly how TR masters the political issues associated with limiting the Trusts that had taken hold of the American economy; and, how he established an executed his imperialistic vision of America.<br />The book falls short in two areas - the first is in the discussion of Roosevelt's personal life.  Morris provides anecdotes but not any real view of how his family affected him.  Given the apparent amount of time he spent with them (a contrast to his early years), something other than anecdotal snippets of the life of daughter Alice should have been included.<br />Second, and more significant, is that Morris again does little to address the huge paradoxes in Roosevelt's policies.  This is most evident in his views and actions on race relations.  Clearly, Roosevelt tried to make some progress in this area; but, he only attempted to make small steps forward.  The president who made America a real world power, cut the Panama canal, reined in the trusts, surely had the political power to do more with race relations.  Roosevelt appears to have been genuinely sympathetic to the needs of American minorities, but Morris never makes it clear what restrained him.  It appears that TR thought race was a lower political priority than other parts of his agenda.  If that's the case, Morris should provide that explanation; if not, then the question is unanswered.<br />These concerns should not stop you from reading this otherwise terrific book.  TR was definitely one of our great presidents, and this biography makes it clear how he transformed America and the world for the better.	2002-05-13

The thing that makes this book so compelling is that you end up rooting for the &quot;bad&quot; guy. <br />The protagonist of this book is a ruthless professional killer who has earned the nickname that is the book's title.  Nonetheless, you end up hoping he'll get away from the even more awful people who hire him, and the police (remember they're supposed to be the &quot;good&quot; guys).<br />Perry's descriptions of settings and characters in this, and all of his books, are excellent.  This one is embellished by a tight plot and a point of view that is different from other novels.<br />I wish I hadn't given my copy away as the book is now hard to find.  Perhaps a publisher will re-issue it; or it'll be made into a movie (hopefully a good one) that will bring it back on the shelves.	2002-03-29

He clearly debunks the old &quot;back of the envelope&quot; myth and shows that Lincoln did not treat the occassion lightly by not preparing his remarks properly.  Instead, Wills demonstrates that Lincoln built on his knowledge of the Bible and classical literature to create a remarkable speech in the manner of Greek funerary oration.  Wills gives us not only a historical context for the speech, but a literary one as well.  For that he earns my praise.<br />The reason for 4 stars is that Wills sometimes forgets what Lincoln so clearly demonstrated - a simple clear sentence can work wonders.  At times, Wills gets a bit carried away with his writing.<br />Last, to the reviewer who said that Lincoln was as bad a president as Clinton; and, to the one who thought he lead us on the road to socialism... Sheesh... what planet are you on?  Clinton would love the comparison, and old guard Republicans should must be spinning in their graves.<br />Dean	2002-03-25

Few  biographies provide as much information about a person's character as this.    Morris presents all of Roosevelt's qualities, both good and bad.  Roosevelt's combination of an enormous drive to succeed and his personal repressions are laid out making it easier to understand why he acted the way he did.<br />The single flaw in this book, as noted by other reviewers, is Morris' lack of exploration of the paradox of Roosevelt's personality.  On one hand Roosevelt championed political reform and the need to improve the lives of average people; but at the same time he was a snob and slick politician. (This same kind of paradox could be said of Bill Clinton).  On one hand, it's admirable that Morris didn't add too much direct commentary that might lead to psychobabble; but, on the other, some examination of this matter should have been included.<br />This minor criticism aside, the book is wonderfully written and gives extraordinary insight to one of our country's most fascinating presidents.	2002-03-21

It's clear that what Bourdain writes about best are: 1) descriptions of cooking (note the descriptions of making fish soup and the debate about beurre blanc); 2) methadone programs; and 3) the use of the &quot;f&quot; word as every part of speech.<br />The plot in this book is weak which is tolerable if the rest of the features of the book make up for it.  But they don't.  The disappointment is that the book ends as if Bourdain just decided to stop writing as opposed to any coming together of events.  <br />Parts of the book are very funny, but Bourdain's writing is terribly uneven.  At times he'll provide terrific descriptions of something, and other times he gives a sparse view.<br />Read it at the beach or on a long trip.  Borrow someone else's copy.	2002-03-18

Sacks book about right-side of the brain cases is absolutely facinating.  Reading about these cases makes one think about things in a different light.  I'd never really thought about how I know where my feet are at any given moment or what it would be like to have such a disconnect between physical reality and how my brain perceives it.<br />Sacks shows not only great compassion for the subjects of the book, but also shows the great difficulty in caring for people whose perspective is so fundementally different than the norm.<br />As a non-psychologist ( I took the one requisite intro psych course in college), I found Sack's explanation of the conditions he encountered clear and as devoid of jargon as he could reasonably make it.	2002-03-18

There are several chapters about his experience in Viet Nam throughout the book.  He should have kept them together and made a more coherent view of his point of view.  If Bourdain had wanted to use it as a touchstone against which to measure other places, he should have done that more clearly.  Instead, his approach comes off as clumsy.<br />Certain portions of the tour are really well described; notably Morocco and the Basque country.  Sadly, the discussions of his trip to Cambodia and Mexico are rather ..., even though it's apparent that these were two really exciting places.  Too bad he didn't have Hunter Thompson as his editor.<br />While dining on exotic and sometimes disgusting things is the theme of the book, Bourdain tells us only that some meal is \\"the best [insert type of food here.. sushi, taco etc.] ever,\\" or that it was really awful.  The descriptions of the bad meals are more skillful than the good ones.  Bourdain is never able to tell you why something is good, even though he's a master at letting you what a bad meal tastes like.<br />Bottom line... quite a few laughs; no real point; wait for the paperback.	2002-01-08

This is particularly noticable in the baking section.  Most cookbooks that discuss baking recommend use of a mixer instead of a processor.  Also, if you don't have a processor, you're out of luck.<br />Nevertheless, Ms. Child offers great ideas in so many areas, it's hard not to get something really useful from the book.  As in most of her books, the explanations of the techniques are nearly always perfectly clear, even for a beginner.  The photos are also very clear and helpful.sd	2001-11-28

Bugialli has produced a good cookbook that has many useful recipes and is decorated with some beautiful photos. However, the book falls short in two areas. <br />First, he refers to recipes in other cookbooks he's written. Without those recipes, some dishes can't be made. Fortunately there aren't many of these instances; but, each book should stand on its own and not require the reader to get several books to make one recipe.<br />Second, Bugialli doesn't give much advice on making the eggless pasta that traditionally is used for pesto. Because it is just a mixture of flour, water, and salt, this pasta must be handled a bit more carefully to avoid making glue. Ask me how I know that.<br />Fortunately, the book has some excellent recipes that go beyond the usual fare. The dishes with seafood and vegetables are particularly good. This makes the weaknesses described above tolerable.	2001-10-22

I've been using it successfully for several years.<br />The book's greatest value is the broad range of recipes that it offers.<br />It has, however, a couple of weaknesses.  As one reviewer pointed out, the mingling of procedures for mixer or food processors, is rather confusing.  Also, a few of the quantities given in the recipes need to be examined.  Fortunately I've baked enough and can feel my way through the problems.<br />Don't let either of these shortcomings discourage you from getting this book.  I still haven't found a better all-around book on the topic.	2001-10-22

It's a good book for someone learning the subject, but offers little beyond that. To that purpose, the recipes are clear and produce the intended results, something more ambitious cookbooks often fail to achieve.<br />However, other books such as &quot;Lord Krishna's Cuisine&quot; and Madhur Jaffrey's books give a far deeper view of Indian cooking.  This book is very basic and does not adequately cover the complexities and variations of the use of spices which form much of the foundation of the cuisine.	2001-10-14

The descriptions of what to do and why are excellent.  Most of the photographs are useful for the beginner.  Surprisingly, and somewhat comically, the recipes don't include quantities which means that the reader must already have a feel for the relative amounts.  This is an odd assumption for a book that focuses on the basics.<br />Nonetheless, the real value of this book is that it makes the process of cooking clear.

The authors avoid the easy out of blaming things on politically motivated journalists, and take a more interesting path.  Sometimes what we read in the press is the result of poor reporting; sometimes it's poor science; and, on occasion it may be the reflection of a writer's personal agenda.  The book tells the kinds of errors that occur (confusing correlation with causation, poor sampling, etc.)<br />What makes the book compelling is the anecdotes used to make the points. The stories of contradictory reporting of scientific make for peculiarly amusing reading.<br />By understanding the types of reporting problems and their causes, people can be more intelligently skeptical about what they read or hear.	2001-05-07

It's a fun book to read, but Bourdain would have benefited greatly by a good editor.  He refers often to his drug habits, and then -poof!- they're gone.  After devoting several chapters to the strange degenerate life he and fellow cooks lead, the last chapters recognize that there is a more conventional side to a chef's life; Bourdain just chose not to take that route for reasons he never tells us.  The flow of the book is rather choppy and doesn't hang together as a neat tale.<br />All that criticism aside, I found myself laughing out loud at some of the experiences Bourdain relates, and his colorful way of telling his story.  Although he lead a seamy life, sometimes I wish I could have hung out with him for a while.  Don't tell my kids.	2001-04-17
