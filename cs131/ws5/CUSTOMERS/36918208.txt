Cute play on words, and I hope everyone who sees it immediately gets the reference.<br />Overall, it reminded me of Glen Cook's Tunfaire series.  A private investigator who can't figure out how he gets wrapped in things that are way over his head.  True, that's the premise for tons of stories, so it really depends on the quality of the writing and the specific twist each author gives it to make it rise above the mundane.  Tucker succeeds quite well.  Already good writing should only improve if he pursues his novel-writing.	2002-10-29

Bernays and The Birth of Public Relations	Books	3	13	15	N	N	Fascinating Biography of an Amoral Man	Bernays is generally acknowledged as the Father of PR.  But, is he also the Father of Spin?<br />Tye writes a fascinating biography of this key communications individual, filled with the key episodes that earned Bernays his moniker.  From getting women to smoke to getting people to eat bacon, Bernays always seemed to figure out a way.<br />But, Tye focuses heavily on these episodes and gives short shift to the implictions and consequences of Bernays's actions beyond fattening the bottom line.  While it is true Bernays could not have fully appreciated all the consequences, his relentless drive to serve his clients reveals a man who forgot that public relations means being the conduit between the public and the client, not being another salesman, no matter how clever.<br />If you're interested in seeing the modern fruition of Bernays's tactics, then I suggest Michael Levine's Guerilla PR: Wired, which updates Bernays's ideas into the digital age.<br />Overall, this book is well-worth reading if you're interested in a man's actions.  But, if you're interested in seeing how a man's actions can affect the world, then you might be better off with another book.	2002-09-01

While I'm not exactly &quot;selling myself,&quot; per se, I was hoping to find some ideas to explain to my daughter.<br />Thankfully, I was not disappointed.  I know this is not a parenting guide, but you have to take the help from whatever source you can.<br />We combined some of the ideas in this book with some of the ideas in Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: wired to greatly assist us in our circulation efforts.<br />I'm happy to report we were successful.

Before the bursting, then.<br />The Internet still has its uses, but an Internet-only strategy?  eBay might do it, but if AOL is having troubles . . .<br />I liked Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired because, despite the name, it combines both Internet and non-Internet strategies.<br />Janal has some good ideas and his examples are good ones, but I'm fairly certain not in the way he intended them to be.	2002-08-31

Morally, I'm not sure if a fair portion of it is defensible.  Promotion isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's got to be handled with taste.  For that, I found Guerrilla PR: Wired by Levine to be much easier to deal with.<br />I'm not saying Allen's ideas don't work--plenty of examples prove they do, in fact, work.  But, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.	2002-08-31

The Marketer's Guide to Public Relations is an excellent example of why.

Consumers and potential consumers have grown wise and cynical about many of the techniques marketers have used for the past several decades.  Yet, marketing remains essential in the current economic system.  Thus, how do you resonate with your consumers?<br />That is the question that this book seeks to answer.  But, it does not just provide an answer.  The authors know three things--there is no &quot;single&quot; consuming monolith out there, you must fully engage the consumer on a variety of levels, and you need to do in a cost-effective fashion.  Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired also knows these facts and focuses on answering them, albeit with the emphasis placed on public relations rather than branding and marketing.<br />Emotional Branding knows, discusses, and analyzes the variety of consumers out there--breaking them down into demographics and psychographics.  Emotional Branding knows, discusses, and analyzes that consumers have grown tired of the over-common branding techniques; instead, Emotional Branding argues that you must fully engage the consumer, intelletually AND emotionally, all five senses.  A product's brand identity must not only be unique to that product, but it's even better if it's unique to that consumer, fully reinforced on a variety of levels through a variety of channels and a variety of sources directly hardwired into the consumer's decision-making process.  Finally, Emotional Branding knows that you still have a balance sheet.  Relying on case histories and several useful strategies, Emotional Branding seeks to explore how its suggestions and methods can be utilized without breaking the budget.	2002-08-21

It provides you with the techniques and secrets of the best and leading members of the industry, from Ketchum, Porter Novelli, Brodeur Worldwide, and other leading players.  <br />While strong on the strategic side, PR Visionaries is a bit weaker on the tactical side.  I don't hold the editors responsible for this, however, as this is not a how-to manual, per se.  For the tactical side, I found Guerrilla PR: Wired by Michael Levine to be a more than adequate resource.<br />PR Visionaries, as the title says, has the giants of the public relations industry tell you how to get noticed, build a brand, develop and protect a reputation, and how to be effective with key opinion-leaders, including the CEO.

While it's well-written, overall, it fails to convey its message while taking into account the Internet.  For that, I suggest Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, which accepts the Internet's uses in a public relations and marketing campaign.<br />Overall, Value-Added Public Relations is a strong, if outdated, piece of work.

Hatchigan draws upon experience to craft a well-written book that explains how to be your own publicist.  As she convincingly aruges, you don't need a huge budget or an expensive consultant to get the publicity you want.<br />How to Be Your Own Publicist reminds me of Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired.

Without a doubt, this book is incredible!  I'm constantly going back to it.  If you want to be your own publicist, then I really suggest getting How to Be Your Own Publicist.	2002-08-21

For that, Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired is an excellent supplement.  Not as wide-ranging as the Handbook, Guerrilla PR: Wired zeroes in on cost-effective public relations strategies and tactics.<br />The Handbook of Effective Public Relations and Integrated Communications has numerous well-respected members in the public relations and marketing fields contributing their wisdom and experience, letting everyone know what the higher ranking people have learned, the tools to success.	2002-08-21

Tons of super-useful stuff, ideas!  But, not exactly web-oriented, unlike Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, which fully takes the Internet into account in how to get publicity.<br />While The Publicity Handbook is great, it's lack of useful stuff about the web does hurt it.

BASS NONPROFIT & PUBLIC MANAGEMENT SERIES)	Books	4	11	11	N	N	Quite Useful for Students	The Jossey-Bass Guide to Strategic Communications for Nonprofits is a detailed examination of the relationship between nonprofits and the media.  As the title says, it provides a step-by-step guide for nonprofits to establish effective relations with the media that result in publicity.  My professor recommended this book to me, and I'm finding it quite useful.  It has a similar approach to Guerrilla PR: Wired by Michael Levine; both are about maximizing your return on investment.<br />I especially enjoyed this book because I'm thinking about working for a nonprofit after graduation, and I haven't seen anywhere near as much about public relations and publicity for nonprofits as I've seen for corporations.	2002-08-21

Sherwin and Avila start off with a well-written explanation of the Internet-not just the World Wide Web, but also ftp, e-mail, Usenet, Internet etiquette.  In short, all the various pieces that fit under the umbrella of the Internet.  They also explore the public relations world if briefer than they did with the Internet--releases, media relations, crisis communication.  Having accomplished the groundwork, they set out on their main objective--explaining how to have effective public relations online.<br />They demonstrate a variety of interesting, if not necessarily the most innovative techniques.  Examples abound, including finding the right consultants, costs, hardware, software, and utilizing websites for maximum advantage.  In this, Connecting Online is none too dissimilar to Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, which also covers using the Internet as the means to attain public relations objectives.<br />Drawing upon their experiences in both the Web and in the public relations industry, Sherwin and Avila provide several valuable pieces of advice.  What makes this text even further stand out is the style in which it is written.  Deft uses of humor in the technical explanations assure that even those with a layman's grasp of the terminology and technology will have little difficulty in understanding, grasping, and using Sherwin's and Avila's methods and advice.	2002-08-21

Everyone still talks about Marilyn!  And James Dean, and he made, what, 3 movies?  So, I thought Rein could answer my questions.  He did, but I found Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired better.  Mike covers the how-tos.  Irv just does the overall stuff.  Still fun to know for Jeopardy, but *how?!*  That's what Irv didn't do as well, the down-and-dirty details.	2002-08-21

It combines both theory and practice, never letting one dominate the other; instead, it combines them, letting their merged strengths shine.  It's similar to Guerrilla PR: Wired by Michael Levine, which also utilizes the practice of public relations to great effect in examining how to attain the objective.<br />Argenti uses several brilliant case histories in his examination of corporate communication.  This text is both informative and useful.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who's involved in the field.	2002-08-21

I was deeply interested to see what they would update and change in this seminal work from their previous edition, most notably anything in the area of extremely cost effective public relations, especially as clients are demanding more and better public relations counsel for less money.  While the 8th edition does not disappoint, nor does it rise above all expectations.  For one who is a neophyte in the area, then I strongly suggest this work, as it provides one of the most comprehensive overviews of our industry that I have ever seen.  For myself, I felt the book needed more coverage in the cost effective area.  I found that coverage in Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, which addresses the burgeoning need of attaining strong coverage without blowing the budget.  Overall then, while I recommend this book, I cannot do so without some reservations.  Nonetheless, I look forward to reading the 9th Edition.	2002-08-20

While it covers public relations in a variety of disciplines, such as multicultural, and it covers a variety of case studies, such as the infamous Exxon Valdez disaster, its sheer strength lies in its writing style.  Seitel's style is quite distinct from many other texts, whose writers preach the importance of writing, but fail to practice it.  Similar to Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, Seitel understands that a message will have less impact if the message is difficult to comprehend.  Both Levine and Seitel make a welcome effort to rely on a friendly, warm, and inviting writing style, one that engages the reader.  <br />Practice of Public Relations strives to keep up with an ever-changing public relations landscape.  While releases retain their importance, it is equally important to consider video.  Similarly, the target public may not be any one demographic, but a multicultural one, each with its own concerns, preferences, gatekeepers, and trusted sources of information.  Also, the book takes into consideration the synergy of integrated marketing communication.  Public relations does not operate in a vaccuum, and Practice of Public Relations takes that into consideration.<br />Above all else, the book lives up to its title, explaining the practice of public relations rather than being a lengthy tome on the theory behind the practice.	2002-08-20

Wow!  Just packed with info, and I loved the Dummies format!  The Internet stuff was a bit weak, though, so same guy loaned me her Guerrilla PR: Wired by Michael Levine.  'Nother Wow!  Totally deals with pr nowadays, the 'net and all that.  But, PR for Dummies really did a good job of covering the whole thing.

In his book, he details the useful lessons he learned, some of which may seem like common sense, but others could be quite surprising, such as how entrepreneurs are not necessarily the best person to hire new employees.  Because of its reliance on Goltz's own experiences, The Street Smart Entrepreneur possesses solid credibility.

Extremely well-written and researched.  Rowden's book is sure to lead to powerful discussions on his ideas, especially 'firmwords,' a fascinating concept.  Of course, a successful corporate identity is quite relevant nowadays, even critical to an organization's success, both on Main Street and Wall Street.

Schmitt does an excellent job of writing a fascinating piece that is sure to help take marketing into the next step.  It's as good as Guerilla PR: Wired, which explores how to use that same emotional connection via the Internet and other technological methods.	2002-08-14

But, it is not satisfied with providing the basic bones and goes on to provide excellent elaboration and detail that helps answer questions.  Well-written and researched.  It covers all the basics--marketing, sales, promotion, etc, without getting bogged down into details that could lead Fiumara away from her basic thrust of the book.  Given how much today's world relies on the Internet, her chapter on Success in Cyberspace is especially helpful.  While it has its own chapter, using the Internet to promote your business is so critical that I would recommend Guerilla PR: Wired, which covers that same subject far more in-depth.	2002-08-14
