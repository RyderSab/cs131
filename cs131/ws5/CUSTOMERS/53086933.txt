What makes this book about the Grateful Dead refreshing is that it was actually written by a band member (Phil Lesh, of course).  Phil discusses his wild experiences as the Dead bass player during the SF psychedelic era and beyond.  Deadheads will really enjoy the book, especially those who play instruments and have a musical bent.  Garcia gave Phil a single lesson on how to play bass and Phil took off from there, incorporating influences from classical music, jazz, rock, and his own creative genie.  The combination of accounts of psychedelic adventures, band events, musical ideas, etc., form a very pleasing whole.  It ends quite beautifully with emotionally convincing portraits of Garcia's last days and Phil's own brush with mortality.  Nice job, Phil!	2005-08-03

Gladwell documents these banalities with anecdotes (some interesting, some not) and bits and pieces of marketing analysis and/or research.    Really, there isn't much more to say about it than that.  There is nothing here that is groundbreaking or original.  In essence, this New Yorker writer wrote an extended magazine piece and put it out as a book.  I think a better title would have been Snap!, but I'm not a marketing analyst and that's just a hunch!    Borrow it and pass it on.	2005-08-01

Previously I believed that the protesters were just anti-capitalists.  Still, I wondered why such venom was directed at organizations (like the IMF, the WTO, or the World Bank) that most Americans probably think about very little.    Professor Stiglitz first points out the difference in the missions and contemporary practice of the IMF and World Bank (he worked for the World Bank after leaving the Council of Economic Advisors under  President Clinton).  Then he carefully reports IMF policies and how the IMF has acted dogmatically and with a \\"one size fits all\\" approach of \\"macrostabilizing\\" developing countries.  In this way the IMF has done quite a bit of harm and economic destruction (he talks at length about the Asian crisis of the late 90s).  He also points how policies that encourage a rapid transformation toward a market economy and liberalizing capital markets (eg, Russia) have backfired and how the slow approach (China) has been more successful.    Prof. Stilitz believes globalization can be beneficial if the right programs and policies (we know what works and what doesn't at this point) are instituted.  This a very good book for anyone interested in the globalization of the market economy.	2005-03-12

While it introduces the student to different styles of rock, it differs from many courses that start with a bluesier approach.  Strong rhythm with power chords, rhythm riffs, and arpeggios are taught early.  Lead playing is gradually worked in and not overemphasized (it isn't under-emphasized, for that matter).  All in all, this is one heckuva balanced and entertaining course.	2004-06-17

The book teaches the A, D, and E power chords, rhythm riffs to the 12 bar blues in A based on classic rock songs, boogie woogie variations, and simple lead riffs.  The rhythm riffs and lead riffs lock into the chord changes by using the A, D, and E minor pentatonic scale or by using target tones of the chords.  Teaching the student this from the beginning is just fantastic.<br />There are companion method and \\"song trax\\" books (ensemble and theory books, too, if you need them) that can be used give the student a well-rounded music education.<br />IMO, this is a superior approach.	2004-05-09

The thrust of the book is to show that desire-independent reasons for action are commonplace (as opposed to the traditional or &quot;Classical&quot; model - Hume, Williams, Davidson, modern decision theory, etc. - that reasons for action follow desires).  Searle argues that there is a gap between reason and decision, decision and action, and continuing to do an action and that reasons for rational action actually are made effective by the agent (the person).  <br />I found the section distinguishing reasons for action from justification for action quite interesting.  The explanation of what Searle calls &quot;weakness of the will&quot; follows very logically from the rest of his argument and is no problem for his theory of rationality.  Finally, Searle touches on the question of neurobiological determinism versus freedom of the will.<br />Anyone who has followed Searle's previous works on intentionality, consciousness, speech acts, and institutional facts will find this as punchy, logical, and clear.<br />All in all, _Rationality in Action_ is an enjoyable work of philosophy.	2004-03-31

The book methodically relys on learning to read actual music (later in the book the tab method is introduced) and slowly, patiently develops the student's fingers, ears, and appreciation of harmony and melody.  Theory is introduced ever so subtley and enjoyably.  <br />The CD tracks are excellent and make quality self-study feasible. Many of the songs or exercises are presented in slow and up tempo versions.<br />This is a treasure chest for the teacher and student or the student who is teaching himself.

Bromell was there.<br />So was I.  <br />But Bromell goes wild analyzing the spaces between words in Beatles or Dylan songs.  While the spirit of the 60s is amenable to me and I agree that rock was an integral part of the times (and quite meaningful - quite \\"lived\\" as Bromell would say), it can be overdone.  Nevertheless, it's an interesting read and at times Bromell's analyses of songs are more interesting than how I experienced the songs back when they were released (I think his PhD helped him look back with a keener eye than I'll ever have).	2003-09-04

His general advice has been known to Vanguard investors for quite some time and the Vanguard &quot;philosophy&quot; has helped me build a nice retirement nest egg over the last 20 years.  You can do it too without fearing the ups and downs of the market.<br />This book is a gem with many facets.  It explains the various investment markets; it describes the different types of mutual funds (bond, stock, balanced, money market, etc.); it tells you how to understand and evaluate risk; and it gives advice on how to construct an investment program for whatever purpose you may have in mind (college tuition, retirement, to preserve and enlarge an inheritance).  Bogle also gives advice on how much risk is prudent for different investment time &quot;horizons&quot;.<br />I bought this book when it first came out and have re-read it several times to make sure I'm on track.

Strassman is definitely more bolted down than Leary, though Strassman, without being judgmental, learns what he can from the Leary psychedelic research disaster at Harvard in the early 60s.    The book is well-written and, above all, sincere.  Strassman really wanted to see if short DMT experiences could a) be legally studied and b) be useful.  It is a tale of persistence:  getting university and government permission, getting research funding, getting \\"human grade\\" DMT, trying to get an adequate setting, trying to dot every \\"i\\" and cross every \\"t\\" possible so that his research was above board.      Interestingly, he explains how psychedelics are really difficult to study in the scientific/clinical setting (which we already knew - but the scientific community is, after all, the legitimizing agency of chemical tools for psychological and other uses)and can also threaten the organized religious community (in this case, a particular sect or branch of Zen Buddhism that Strassman adheres to - I would suspect, however, that you could generalize from Strassman's experience to other religions).    Strassman comes across as genuinely curious, compassionate, and determined in his efforts to find out if psychedelics can evolve from their sordid recent past to an acceptable tool for insight, inspiration, creativity, or as an aid for helping to solve personal problems.  This text will probably be one of the classics of psychedelic literature (though that's not for me to say!).    If you are seriously interested in psychedelic research you will want to have this book on your bookshelf.	2003-02-10

It covers classical, fuzzy, and quantum logic and explores the attempts to found mathematics on logical foundations (Frege, Russell). The ideas of all the greats are introduced with ease (Leibniz, Godel, Hilbert, Aristotle, Quine, Davidson, Turing, Wittgenstein, etc). And it details how computers have their basis in logical systems.<br />It's presented in cartoonish fashion, but is an intelligent (and not a dumbed down) overview of the subject. Someone who has not had logic will benefit from a couple of readings. As the book is not long this shouldn't be difficult (it might just be all you'd ever need or want to know about the subject).<br />There is a section of further reading that recommends one of the best 1st order logic book - Tomassi - that I've encountered.

Edmonds and Eidinow do a great job presenting the personalities of Wittgenstein, Popper, and others while focusing on a minor philosophical-historical event.

Both W &amp; P have similar and dissimilar backgrounds (different social classes in Vienna and both end up emigrating) and personalities.  But both had very different views of the task of philosophy.  <br />The authors don't get bogged down in over elaborate explorations of personality, technical philosophy, social history, etc.  Just enough is given to make this a satisfying tale of what actually happened in the brief meeting between P and W and the many forces behind their clash.<br />The writing style was so thrilling I read it in two nights (I'm typically a slow reader).	2002-08-20

If you need to do some background reading for context, I'd suggest the two brief chapters on W in Nicholas Fearn's \\"Zeno and the Tortoise\\". After that, just read this text carefully and don't rush. W is very clear, though he has somewhat of a rambling style, and it is not that difficult to understand what he thinks the purpose of philosophy should be: dissolving philosophical problems by whatever method is suitable - mostly by seeing how ordinary language is misused to create confusion. This is not to say that there aren't real philosophical problems, but that many call more for clarification rather than a solution.<br /><br />You may not agree with W's approach to philosophy, but if you are interested in modern philosophy it's hard to dismiss his plea to examine the way you are asking questions. And he is his own best introduction to his own way of doing philosophy.	2002-07-04

All the books in the &quot;Winning Chess&quot; strategies are excellent and the serious, developing tournament player will benefit by carefully reading through all of them.  What I liked about this book in particular is that it is never dull and does not inundate the reader with complex examples.  Each position or game chosen clearly illustrates the point of chess strategy that is being made.<br />I read this after reading Silman's &quot;Reassess Your Chess&quot; (another excellent book), which is probably why this book was easier to read through.  However, each are worth possessing and reading several times.  It's just too bad that they seem to be going out of print.	2001-12-12

If you love natural history, trilobites, and authors who can write well, you'll love this book.  It is a nice blend of science, humor, and deep appreciation for the forces that shaped and continue to shape the history of our planet.  Fortey brings his love of trilobites alive talking about personalities, including his own.  And he waxes philosophical in just the appropriate proportions.  Enjoy this book as I did....<br />... and then head out back out to the rocks with enthusiasm.	2001-07-30

It isn't bad, but I found Anthony Kenny's \\"Frege\\" and Joan Weiner's \\"Frege Explained\\" to be more lucid introductory texts. If you are very new to Frege, try Weiner's book first (Salerno's book on Frege is also worth a mention and preferred) .  But even if you aren't new to Frege's thought, it's hard to see how much is gained by laboring with Noonan's introduction.<br /><br />Don't forget to read Frege himself (see the Blackwell Readers, _The Frege Reader_).  Frege is a top notch writer and his own words deserve attention and careful study.	2001-04-08

Kenny covers each major work of Frege in detail with clear explanations of the argument and purpose of each work. There is a brief biographical sketch in the beginning and the book finishes with a summary of Frege's achievements.	2001-04-03

The book is a pleasure to read, however, not only becaues of the selections and the fine introductory section, but because Frege is such a clear writer and thinker himself. I particularly enjoyed Frege's Begriffshrift - you can see modern quantificational logic being born.	2001-02-21

Identity is primitive and undefinable; existence is a predicate (!), predicates are more like singular terms than names (!), and \\"truth\\" really means something and is not redundant (!). This small text is of particular interest to those interested in analytic philosophy. It's radical and written with extraordinary clarity. Not that it doesn't have parts that can be attacked (what doesn't?), but it is a refreshing re-examination of important logical properties.	2001-02-09

I think highly of Thomas Nagel as a serious philosopher.  If you don't have a clue about philosophy, this is probably about as good an introduction as you can get.  Nagel writes about philosophical problems that have haunted human minds throughout the ages.  It is intentionally ahistorical for the good reasons that Nagel gives.<br />If you have had exposure to philosophy in, say, a college level course, this book will be much too simple for you.  But if you want something to grease the neurons to start thinking in the abstract way that is philosophical in character, then this book is for you.  It's probably a great text for kids in a high school course or adults who are just realizing the benefit of stepping back from life for a moment or two to reflect on what it all means.	2001-01-20

I went from this tape to Hume's &quot;An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding&quot; and &quot;An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals&quot;.  I don't think it would have been such an easy transition without learning how Hume fits into Western philosophical history and what problems concerned him.  It startled me to discover that Hume's major point is that inductive thinking (thinking about &quot;matters of fact&quot; ) is irrational:  forming general laws about the world has its basis in custom and experience and not by the sort of reasoning used in math and logic (&quot;relations of ideas&quot; in Hume's lexicon).<br />Hume's political, historical, and ethical ideas are also interesting and I was surprised to learn how much Hume's ideas on the separation of powers in government had influenced James Madison.	2001-01-12

McGinn on the philosophy of mind.  McGinn is a first rate philosopher and his foray into ethics is further proof of his talent.  His method of analysis in this volume is quite interesting and contemporary.  It should be a useful addition to the bookshelves of anyone seriously interested in ethical thinking.	2001-01-12

For the interested, it isn't all that difficult to read.   Actually, it's fun compared to S. J. Gould's excellent, but far more  difficult, Wonderful Life.<br />Conway Morris is also very persuasive in how  much prominence &quot;contingency&quot; (randomness) in biological  evolution deserves.  Against Gould, Conway Morris finds it unremarkable and  discusses how evolution by natural selection is more coherent and  predictable than Gould would have one believe.  CM also shows that the  facts just do not support Gould's contention that anatomic forms are more  impoverished today compared to the welter of body forms that appeared  during the Cambrian Explosion.<br />In sum, this is a fun, well-written book  for the lay crowd that enjoys palentology, the Paleozoic Era, and a glimpse  at the  issues debated in the academic arena.	2000-09-09

From his pondering on numbers to his insights into what makes language meaningful to his revolutionizing logic, Frege deserves  recognition for achievements that have had a marked influence on  philosophy.    This book is an introduction, but is not necessarily easy.   However, neither is it a daunting task to read.  It is a crisp, clear, and  interesting adventure right in tune with the other Past Master books.  (An expanded work by Weiner, Frege Explained, was issued in 2004 and is preferred).	2000-04-25

If you want more than a shallow introduction to Aquinas' life and thought, this is an excellent place to begin.  Like other contributions in the Past Masters series, the text offers a brief biography, articulates the main  philosophical concerns, offers some criticism, then reflects on the  consequences or influences of the subject under study.	2000-03-25

Scruton is in obvious awe of Kant's contribution to philosophty (rightly so) and astonishingly presents Kant  without a lot of the impenetrable phrases Kant cooked up to explain  himself.	2000-03-24

Why?  As McGinn clearly articulates the problem, modern philosophers and  neuroscientists have mistaken consciousness for a very bad case of hiccups.   Everything else follows.  The frequent reference to Star Trek shows that  McGinn takes none of this seriously and would rather be skiing in the Alps  than trying to present one more guess about how the brain can be aware of  the world.  In fact, McGinn slams the lid down on the whole project,  asserting that the answer will never be known.  Not now.  Not nowhere.  And  why?  Digging from his obvious psychedelic past, McGinn says it is a  problem of space...and not the sort of space in your living room where you  arrange sofas, chairs, and coffee tables, but n-dimensional space that no  human being can enter without whopping doses of Ketalar.  So where does  this leave the mind-body problem as we enter the 21st century?  If McGinn  is correct, and I think he is, it was left in a coffee can at local church  social by a pious elderly woman who had trouble with her hearing aids  through the whole affair.<br />Good book!	2000-03-07

Scruton write in clear prose and amazingly gets to the heart of some dense matters and explicates the central concerns with relative ease.  I majored in  philosophy over 20 years ago and I wish that I had had such a well-written  and comprehensive text to refer to in order to put modern philosophy all  &quot;together&quot;.<br />A background in philosophy no doubt makes reading  this a bit easier.  A beginner might instead what to read Thomas Nagel's  introductory text and perhaps Searle's little text on Mind, Language, and  Society first.  Then dive into this and you are on your way.<br />First rate.	2000-02-17

To appreciate the philosophy of language you have to be amazed that we can  make noises or marks to others that carry meaning and elicit the variety of  responses that take place in human social interaction.  Lycan brings you  right into the heart of this phenomenon and brings out all the important  ideas and counter ideas in lively and occasionally funny prose.  Most  importantly, he makes the topic readily undertandable and  interesting.<br />Beyond the topic of &quot;meaning&quot;, Lycan surveys  speech acts, metaphors, etc.  I think it will give the interested reader a  pretty good grasp of the central issues in the field.  The introductory  summaries for each section and the study questions and tips for further  reading make this a great book for the student or interested nonstudent  (like me).<br />If you are perplexed at how the philosophy of language can be  fun and interesting, this is the book for you.	2000-02-12

This book is an excellent summation of Searle's thought.  The first section is an attack on antirealist (i.e., there are no facts in the world independent of facts we construct with thoughts and language) strains in  contemporary intellectual circles that is right on the money.  The next  section reiterates Searle's position that consciousness is a biological  phenomenon and the product of the brain.  While I think that Searle avoids  ontological issues, his main aim is to do away with the Cartesian (i.e.,  the mind is a distinct substance from matter) framework that haunts the  mind-body debate.<br />Finally, Searle presents his thoughts on how social and  institutional facts (like &quot;money&quot;, &quot;points in a  ballgame&quot;, &quot;marriage&quot;, etc.) enter into the world.  The  conclusion of the book talks about what the role of philosophy is and how  philosophy makes progress.  That is, Searle explains the importance of  philosophy.	2000-02-09

David Lynch revels in the grotesque and overuses character thoughts (which works in the text but is overbearing in the movie) to ruin a good thing.  Fortunately,  the book is one of the best pieces of fiction I have ever read.  It is  chock full of archetypal themes, including the hero journey, and is just  simply gripping.  There is superb character development, internal and  external character tension, and a helluva good story.  If you saw the movie  and hated it, approach the book with an open mind.  It does not have many  of Lynch's absurd interpretations or fabrications and will astonish you	1999-09-06
