Also, there are a lot of charts that look good but really don't help that much.  9 pages on the use of honey seems a bit much too.

The characters are so familiar they will remind you of people you know.  Keep a box of tissue handy for the ending.  It's fast paced and easy reading.  Very enjoyable and stands on it's own.	2001-12-11

However, some areas were quite good and the illustrated shelters was excellent. For general info, it would be fine and is small enough to be portable so you could take it with you in an emergency.	2001-12-11

These people are real to me.  This one has a touch of the who-done-it to add to the flavor so it satisfies my addictions to both fantasy and mystery at the same time.  And I BARELY figured out the mystery which is saying a lot for the expertise of the author.  My only complaint is that I have to wait for the next book in the series to come out.  Can't wait!	2001-12-11

I hope to be able to read this continuing story for a very long time in many books to come.  Don't stop at one.  Get them all.  You won't be disappointed.  The characters are well defined and the story line complex but plausible.  Most of all it's just good reading.  You really care about the characters and their problems and find yourself forgetting this is a fantasy.	2001-12-11

Not only is it detailed but also has helpful illustrations.  If you are going camping I'd buy a copy to take with. It's small enough to tote and could come in very handy.	2001-12-11
