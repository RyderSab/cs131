Kennedy was a puzzling politician, but Mr. Sidorenko renders a comprehensive story of his life and the role his spiritual dimension played in shaping his life, his politics and policy, and ultimately history.<br />Very good reading.	2001-06-26

Undeniably very often described, among other things, as, above all ruthless, Bobby Kennedy was and probably remains one of the most controversial figures in America.<br />The author of Robert F. Kennedy: A Spiritual Biography goes past the glitter, and revisionism of his explosive subject and examines his life and his politics (with a heads-on approach--not unlike Kennedy's own)largely through the lens of his character, partly which was undoubtedly influenced by his deep religious background and foundation.<br />It's been stated many times that Kennedy was one of the most complex and baffling personalities ever to emerge on the American political scene. What's been missing up until now, and especially for the newer generations, is a clear view of the real man rather than simply concentrating on the public image and his political career. <br />This book effectively explores the life of the man America still loves to love--and, still loves to hate.	2001-06-13

The author strips away the decades of myth to reveal a complex man of execptional depth and dimension, and ultimately a politician who gave this country hope, and &quot;set the stage whereby future politicians could lead with no less conviction and hope.&quot; Mr. Sidorenko's compelling profile lets us understand the continuing fascination with a man who was at once an ambitious career politician and a man who could rise above the political give and take; a ruthless prosecutor and a deeply moral man; a prosecutor who often ignored civil rights and a man of undeniable faith and sympathy and devotion to the poor and disadvantaged. The book very convincingly shows how RFK reconciled these opposite forces. An excellent short, but rounded account of RFK's life and the politics of the sixties.	2001-03-29

A delightful look at one of the world's greatest poets and humanists--Wines provides us with an insightful and precise portrait of a riveting historical figure. Her writing is intelligent, readable, and thought-provoking. I can't think of a more stimulating book about Rumi; the book is both informative and a wonderful read that not only sheds light on the nature of Rumi's spirituality and mystical endeavors and creativity, as well as his dramatic literary achievments but also elucidates the modern reader's strong appeal to and identification with Rumi.	2001-03-02

He went out in search not of great figures and noble character, but of human nature, and he always found. So too does author Leslie Wines in Rumi: A Spiritual Biography.<br />Wines's biography of Rumi is rich with good storytelling and marvelous irony and, like Strachey, with just a little touch of sardonic wit. How else to approach the incredible legends and hagiographers of Rumi? But her approach is never disrespectful or irreverent. While critical of the hagiographic trend of Rumi's contemporaries, as well as most future historians, Wines does not simply and tediously recount these legends but, while wading through such ushers in a fresh and bold imagining of this great poet with a critical contemporary eye. Ultimately Rumi comes to life on the pages of this short literary biography like he never has before. <br />Wines humanizes Rumi. In short, Wines shows how Rumi's work responds to an increasing need many of us have for an instinctive and mystical response to life, and for a more joyful daily exiistence. She shows us how Rumi's very broad appeal--even to those who are not particularly interested in spiritual writings or even poetry--derives from his very genuine cosmopolitan nature and character. Like Rumi's own work there is little sentimentality for its own sake in the author's examination of her subject, which very convincinly sheds light on Rumi's contemporary relevance and dazzling creative appeal and our mystic identification with this great humanist. And she shows us how Rumi's meditations on love and the chaotic nature of poetry and life, along with the extraordinary social, cutural and politically tumultuous times (not unlike our own)of his life resonate with the modern reader and transcend medieval times to our own present day.	2001-02-27

The writing is very good and I like what amounts to the combination of a somewhat of a journalistic style with great storytelling. The author was obviously enchanted with her subject,b ut unlike many other writers on Rumi, does not take herself or Rumi for that matter TOO seriously. What do I mean by that? It would seem to me that she approaches Rumi in just the way he himself would want to be appraoched, in fact asked to be, and would have approached his own self. <br />Leslie Wines captures Rumi with a vibrancy and immediacey I've yet to see. I am a great admirer of the Penguin Lives series. A large part of the tremendous success of Penguin Lives is its nack for hitching up just the right author and subject; absolute compatibility, simpatico between subject and writer. So too with this series with Leslie Wines and Rumi.	2001-02-24

While I am not a book-making expert I found this a beautifully designed book and as an English composition instructor of CUNY I found the book very well written and an immensely enjoyable read. I've been reading Rumi's poetry for years and looking at many different translations but I've never run across a biography of Rumi and was thrilled to see this one.<br />Rumi: a Spiritual Biography places Rumi within the social, political and cultural context of his time. Ms. Wins is not an Islamist or for that matter a Rumi scholar and this is perhaps her most enduring value to the general reader. Her approach to Rumi is vigorous, occasionally with a sly sense of whimsey, always intelligent and makes both Rumi's life and his work very accessible to the general reader.<br />From this short and energetic literary biography, I have for the first time a good vision of Rumi as a universal human being. His appeal and relevance to the modern reader becomes abunduntly clear--as a poet as well as an ecstatic spiritual being. Ms. WIns clearly demonstrates how Rumi calls to us from beyond the concerns of conventional religiosity and limiting beliefs. Her probing curiosity and very lively interest rather than another hagiographic interpretation or pious reverence is highly refreshing. Of particular value is her discussions and examination how in Rumi the divine and human realms intermingle and how our spiritual dimension and human nature find fullfilment in being united.	2001-02-23

What also emerges is a work of critical balance--and incredible depth for such a short work. <br />Mr. Sidorenko displays a strong sense of the virulent nature of opposition to his subject, as well as the phenominal devotion to RFK from both the popular and political spheres. This is critical for understanding the greater sense of Kennedy's milieu.

But I still think Kennedy remains a figure more of potential than action--and perhaps therein lies his real legacy. And while Mr. Sidorenko maintains his objective eye throughout the book, his objectivity does not place him at such a distance as to remove him from his subject, nor prevent him from making an intimate and personal connection with his subject. There is a rare, good balance found here.	2000-12-26

Nicholson doesn't water Rumi down; often, very often, Rumi's work was incredibly rambling, and extremely hard to follow--but delightful and compelling nonetheless. Though I do immensly enjoy Barks' work, he makes Rumi too tidy, and much of Rumi's brilliant essence and expansive mind is missed.<br />I recently stumbled across an absolutely engaging biography of Rumi, and which is a popular, short form account. Why the heck did it take so long for this? is anybody's guess. There is one other very good biography out there by a scholar named Iqbal, but even this is still too academic.

But Sidoreno treats his subject with discernment, clarity and elegance and is not afraid to take a strong stand. And it's this stand or point of view that sets his book gently at odds with other more recent accounts of RFK. The spiritual angle is persuasive and without banging any religious drum. The chronology is very thorough but I found it a bit confusing, or awkward, as it consists of a biographic chronology and an historic one (this is always fascinating in chronologies) but are not thusly and clearly identified (I did quickly figure it out but it would have been nice to have it identified as such). The book is a quick, lively and intelligent read; just what someone might be looking for, who does not have the time to get mired in a 500-page tome on RFK. Staying absolutely clear of sensationalism and speculation, the author still manages to provide us with a terricly intersting, and even entertaining story. Very glad to see the short biographies coming back. This particular book is a great book for those who do not know where to start with all the scores of books out there on RFK (and especially as an unbiased account) and it would seem a gem for college courses on the politics of the 60s.	2000-12-12

Invoking God seems to be in in politics this time around but Mr Sidorenki makes a pretty convincing case for Bobby Kennedy as being the last politician who could use a true religios sense to steer fellow citiczens &quot;from the deep wells of cynicism&quot;.<br />Without any sensasionalism the author, in just a 192 pages, deftly weaves a detailed and clear, moving account of one of the most important leaders of the 20th century. Steering clear of the temptation to romanticize, and with what appears to be resolute avoidance of sentamentality, the author provides us with more than just a good introduction to Robert Kennedy, but a vigorous, fair and candid portrait of a vivid politician.<br />Would especially recommend to those new to Robert Kennedy and those interested in the politics of the 60s. But even other Kennedy &quot;enthusiasts&quot; will find this one refreshing and without the baggage other authors (pro &amp; con) tend to bring to the subject of Bobby Kennedy. Great job. My only criticsm is with the sidebar pages; they are very well written, very interesting, even entertaining and break up the text, but still I found them somewhat distracting (but maybe that's just me, i am a rather fussy reader.).	2000-11-14

I may not agree with Marshall's final  analysis but she's an excellent storyteller and knows how to weed out a  story. She also knows how to take a strong stand, express a point of view  but at the same time stay out of the story--something Ms. Gordon may learn  from--at least when attempting to write a biography.

I suppose, a meditation, as she calls this book, is its best description. However, a meditation is not a biography and it  seems to me an easy way out of doing the hard work of research and analysis  and writing required to successfuly pull off the short form. See Marcel  Proust by Edmund White: exemplar writing of the short form, popular  biography. While some of Gordon's meditation is interesting is just doen't  belong here and she tries too hard to tie in, compare, etc Joan w/ our  modern times. I did enjoy many of her insights and ideas about the Church  and her unsentimentality or romanticizing of Joan refreshing. But I never  was able to really get a feel for Joan or her times; I could never immerse  myself in Joan's story because the author was too present, too obvious w/  all her medititations. Point of view is paramountto the short form  biography but it should not overwhelm the authors subject or the subjects  story. And, again, there is a difference between &quot;meditation&quot; (as  in the essay) and point of view. It may be argued that the short form  biography is an &quot;extended essay,&quot; and that is largely true but  when a short form biography becomes more of an outlet for meditation than  serious exploration of the subject rather than the author's reflections, it  ceases to be biography. I also found the breaking down of chapters with  subheads distracting (because they simply were not needed) and pedantic.  And while the author's reviews and interpretations of all the other books  on Joan were interesting, still it seemed too pat and not part of the  biographical dialogue; or rather, it could have worked as part of the  continual narrative. I'm sorry, I erally enjoy Gordon's writing generally,  but this just didn't work at all as a short form popular biography, or  warrant be put between 2 book covers.	2000-03-30

It tries too hard to be a novel and  employs too many literary tricks and devises to pull it off as even a short  biography. As a real biography nut I have been following both the Penguin  Lives series and the Lives &amp; Legacies series by the Crossroad  Publishing Company. While the Lives &amp; Legacies series does not tout the  big authors this series does, the writing is exellent and in just 192 pages  they manage to include the backmatter, that as a reader of even short form  biography want and expect. Really, this series is worth checking out.  Admirably as well, this series supports both new and established authors.  First, that's rather rare these days in the publishing world; and second,  it's great to hear some new voices.	2000-02-29

Steed also discusses in depth Ellington's ability to write for the  individual voice, or band member, which seems to be, at least partly, what  made and marks him as such an extraordinary and perhaps greatest American  composer--that and his overwelming dedication to his music and a relentless  ability to constantly break new ground. <br />Steed's grasp of Ellington and  his music, particularly Ellington as a composer is tops. She draws on the  enormous archives at the Smithsonian Institution but also on extensive  firsthand interviews with scores of people who were intimately familiar  with Duke Ellington and his music, and especially his development of his  sacred music and concerts. It is in the area of the sacred concerts that  Steed breaks new ground but also her focus of Ellinton as composer, as well  as his oft forgotten important work in Hollywood. Her outstanding  achievment is that she accomplished this in 192 pages. Steed covers the  entire scope of Ellington's remarkable life and career and her insights are  very welcome and as engaging as they are informative.	2000-02-25

I picked this book up after reading Joan of Arc in this Lives and Legacies Series. This new book delivers everything it promises. I'm a real biography nut with an interest in a very broad range of subjects (and that's just  what this series delivers) but have little time to immerse myself in a 500  or 700 page reading. So it's great to be able to pick up these short  biographies, get a great read, and then decide if I want to explore a  subject in further depth. But I can tell you with both these books, short  as they are (192 pages), they are still very in-depth, scholarly and but  still accessible to the popular audience. Duke Ellington was a particular  pleasure as I knew nothing about his Sacred music and Concerts, nor have I  run across anything that examines so fully the films that him and his  orchestra were featured in, and which by the way Ellington had a  significant role in developing. Author Janna Steed offers up a terrific  little gem with this new book on Duke Ellington.	2000-02-25

After studying Ellington's life and compositions through this book more closely, in his music, even when it is  not overtly religious, one can quickly see that Ellington did indeed work  out his spirituality through his music, as this author so convincingly  argues. Of especial interest is the author's conception of spirituality and  her deep artistry of both genuinely recognizing Ellington's and making that  connection with his music, and how both shaped and influenced his life.  This is not a scholarly tome, but rather a wonderfully quick, short read.  As one of many old Ellington fans, my guess is that Duke Ellington would  have smiled brightly and given his big stamp of approval to this book.	2000-02-25

This is a terrific book! However, if it had not been so highly recommended to me by two other people I don't know that I  would have gone to all the trouble of finding it or even buying it once I  did. (Thank God for Amazon.com!)For all you readers looking to but this  book: DO. And don't be fooled by the scant book jacket copy, which  unfortunately doesn't give a reader much to go on, or at least in my  opinion, enough. Don't be fooled by the size of this little book either. A  good story really can be told in just under 200 pages! Anyhow, for those  new to Duke Ellington, it's a great place to start. This REALLY IS a fresh,  new look at the man, and especially his great sacred music and Sacred  Concerts. Really a MUST read for those old and new to The Duke.	2000-02-23

I just got finished listening to the new CDs of Duke Ellington's Sacred Music, picked up at Borders. Wow! While I was listening to this great stuff I was reading this book. And Wow! again. If you want the nitty, gritty, the  lowdown, or dope so to speak, on the Duke you'll have to go somewhere else.  Miss Steed does give you the whole story but her emphasis is on his work,  his artistry, and his legend--what the Good Man left us with--and his  Sacred Music, which he said, was not his best work, but his most important  work. And it was real, man, this is what I was looking for, someone who  really had something new to say about The Man, and knew what they were  talking about! Buy this book and get to know the Duke and the man behind  the legend.	2000-02-23

Nor is there any  Pollyanna-ish writing. I agree with other reviewers in that Steed makes an  astounding and perfectly convincing case for Duke Ellington's spirituality  and its presense in and influence on his music. Her breezy yet scholarly  approach is direct and simple and this biography makes an interesting  addition to the still ever growing (and glutted) literature on Ellington.  Adding to the book's appeal are the several side bars--a couple involve  interesting profiles, and a couple others and of particular interest, are a  close look at the several films featuring Ellington and his orchestra and  Ellington's role in shaping these films. The book is always engaging,  well-crafted and original. &quot;Duke Ellington: A Spiritual  Biography&quot; should find a very wide audience and is a welcome primer  for those new to Ellington, and regardless of spiritual inclination.	2000-02-21

Duke Ellington's music and life would seem to imply that historical  stylistic boundaries can be breached--that music, in effect, ought to  aspire to a place beyond style, or to use the words which Duke used to  describe himself-- &quot;beyond category.&quot; Steed's treatment of  Ellington as a complex--and spiritual man is compelling--and without every  sounding preachy, and without romanicization, despite the author's clear  sympathy with her subject. Steed's careful and extensive research and  colorful storytelling result in an impressive and dynamic new side of this  great man of jazz. The author's prose style is down-to-earth as she offers  readers an intriguing glimpse behind Ellington's long-maintained veil of  privacy and public mask. Steed does not exploit Ellington's more gossipy or  sensational story (though nor does she deny it), but instead, she deftly  weaves her story of Duke's spirituality into a detailed, respectful and  ultimately fuller and truer portrait. Steed delivers a far more poignant  account than the scores of other biographies on the Duke. I especially and  highly recommend this book for new initiates to this great king of Jazz.	2000-02-19

That's a fair question and I'm sure I'm not the first to ask it. But Steed very convincingly argues and proves that indeed there is: Ellington's spirituality and his sacred music and sacred concerts. I highly recommend  this book, especially for those new to Duke Ellington but also to those  interested in his later music.	2000-02-17

So don't be deceived by the samll size of this book. Duke Ellington's story is told with  remarkable depth, breadth, chock full of great anecdotes, first-hand  interviews and many photos that have not been widely seen. There are  several side-bar pages, which I particularly liked, and she offers up an  excellent discography written by John Hasse. Steed's take on Ellington's  spirituality is quite fascinating and, surprisingly, entirely persuasive.  Of particular value in this book are the discussions and story of the  Duke's sacred music and concerts. I highly recommend this book.	2000-02-15

Marshall's book is a succinct, intelligent, and lively read,  mixed with a sharp wit and punchy sensibility. (This from an academic  noless.)And if you're looking for an exhaustive and thoroughly academic  study of Joan, then any of Pernoud's books you'll want to pick up. But if  you're looking for a good and thorough book on Joan for the general reader,  and one that cuts through all the ridiculous (but fascinating nonetheless)  mythologizing and romanticizing of her, and which offers a fresh and  realistic point of view, then you'll definitely want to buy this book.  Marshall knows how to cut to the chase but without diminishing any of the  excitment or extraordinariness of Joan's remarkable story and short life. A  must read for anyone interested in Joan of Arc. And, unusually, I might  add, a read that should be of interest not just to the general reader, but  even those esoteric &quot;highbrows.&quot;	2000-02-12

My mom bought me this book for Christmas even though its a book for adults. One of the things i liked most about this book is that the author Mrs. Steed is a jazz  singer too and she produced that really great program about Duke ellington  for PRI last year. My mom says Mrs. Steed is an expert in Mr Ellington's  sacred music and that she's an exciting new scholar but something like an  outsider I guess because she's new and that it takes alot of courage to to  write this book. I guess because everyone thinks Duke Ellington wasn't  really spiritual. Am I missing something? That's like saying Jack Kerouac  wasn't spiritual beause he did drugs and was an alcolholic and roamed all  around. I may be only 14 but i know this is a really important book on Duke  Ellington and like my mom says a great contribution to Duke ellington  studies. I think most adults are really narrow and closed minded when it  comes to anthing new or new ideas and that is the most harmful thing to the  arts and music. I'm only 14 but i know that. Adults also think teenagers  are cliqueish but it seems to me that it its really adults who are. How  boring. You should read this book and get enlightened.	2000-02-12

Pick this one up	The author wonderfully captures not only Duke's genius, but his compassion, courage,generosity and irresitible charm. Steed has that indispensable ability of telling Duke's story well--and not just the big  story, but the &quot;lesser&quot; story, that of Duke Ellington's genuine  and undeniable spirituality and profound humanity. She shows critical and  intelligent sense toward the Maestro and wide and deep learning in relation  to his Sacred Concerts (which as far as I have been able to gleen has been  largely unstudied before Steed's years of research and this book). The book  is particularly a must read for anyone who is just beginning to explore  Duke Ellington. It is also a wonderful exemplar of biography in the short  form--that fabulously exciting and once-popular genre. It looks like this  &quot;Lives &amp; Legacies&quot; series just might be bringing the genre  back. Let's hope.	2000-02-12
