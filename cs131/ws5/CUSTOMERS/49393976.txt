US	49393976	RDK5JBXKIS6H1	0806976292	81079251	Feng Shui Your Life	Books	2	122	148	N	N	New agey and dogmatic.	I realize that I'm going against the flow here, but I found this book disappointing. The author likes a kind of design of interiors which is linear and modern. I have nothing against that. What I don't agree about, is that the author tries to convey the message \\"My own style IS FENG SHUI\\". No, that's wrong!   For example, the author clearly advises against clutter. Well, I have seen unpleasantly cluttered, messy homes and I have seen \\"cluttered\\" homes with a great deal of personality and wellcoming, positive energy. I dislike messy homes, but TO ME, the auhtor's style is exceedingly dry, so dry in fact that it reminds me the rooms of an elegant hospital. There is a picture (repeated in the back cover) of a foyer with blaze orange raincoats hanging from a rack along with blaze orange ... binoculars. To my own personal taste that's Kitch, man! The book reflects a manichaean approach all along, and it reaches the very bottom where  plants are listed for being 1) good for feng shui 2) bad for feng shui. This is ridiculous (incidentally, no explanations are provided). Among the plants that supposedly are bad, there are bromeliads and cacti.   The truth is that feng shui arises from an intricate interaction between the outdoor space, the indoor space, and the people who live in there. It's a matter of harmony, sacredness and intention. I was grown with very ancient furnitures and lots of plants of any kind in my parents' home: if you put me in the author's space, I'll get sick (and the other way around, probably). \\"Creating Sacred Space With Feng Shui\\" by Karen Kingston undertakes a much better approach because it favors the idea that the people who live the space should do a lot of thinking and work hard to create the conditions for feng shui. What I see in this book is the author's personal opinion of the \\"ideal\\" interiors dressed up with a little bit of cheap, cheasy, new age.	2005-10-10

I browsed about a dozen of books and this is the only one I bought. It is a great book. It is concise and informative. It is practical, yet it's not \\"dry\\". It was written by someone who wants to TEACH you how to make soaps. It overviews base oils and their properties, botanicals and essential oils. It shows how to make cold-processed soap bars, liquid soap, clear soap, massage melts and bath bombs. Many recipes are listed, but most important it delivers a ground knowledge that you can use to design your own recipes, if you so chose. It's the only book I know that teaches the general principles of blending essential oils. The chapter about resources shall direct you well, whether you want to buy in Europe, the U.S. or Australia. Lye calculator and all recipes are given in both metric and imperial. The pictures are magnificent. I recommend this book.	2005-07-03

This book captures what the fishing on this magnificent river is all about. The pictures are very neat (not top-notch, yet they are taken by a high-level amateur). It has been created by people who are willing to share their knowledge of the river and the awe we all feel when we are lucky enough to be on the water. Pictures are taken during all seasons. The book shows the environment, as well as the angling itself.	2005-07-02

The Believer shall find all s/he needs: this totem means this, that omen means that. Period. In this respect Andrews' books are somewhat simplistic.

If you are looking for an overview on shamanism look elsewhere. There are excellent books like the ones auhtored by Tom Cowan (\\"Shamanism: As a Spiritual Practice for Daily Life\\" and \\"Fire in the Head\\"). The author tells about her own path on the \\"way of the Nagual\\". There is one thing that I didn't quite understand. The author speaks highly of herself, stating that she is a rather smart person. Judging from her accompishments she may very well be right, but how come she didn't manage to learn Spanish despite studying with a Mexican master for all those years? Regardless, I have reasons to believe that everyone who is willing to share her experiences, shall like this book.	2005-05-16

It's a lot of book for the money. It's tidy, with picturesque schemes, drawings and pictures. However, at a more careful reading, it sounds like a Native American version of the Western zodiac astrology. The wheel is split into four quadrants (the directions), each quadrant is divided into three sectors, thus making 12 \\"months\\" (aren't there 13 moons in the Native American tradition?). Each sector is symbolized by one stone, one plant, one animal. Everything is geometrically boxed. Everything makes perfect sense. Every page is smudged with a little bit of tribal names, a little bit of tribal cosmology, a little bit of the Kokopelli stuff, a little bit of do-it-yourself ceremonies ... Of course, the Great Spirit is there, as are Mother Hearth and the Thunderbird. <br />Cheesey New Age at its best in my humble opinion.	2005-04-17

Every now and then you come across a book which is right on the spot. It's written by someone who is willing and capable to share his/her wealth of knowledge in a CLEAR way. This is one of those few books. From beef to rabbit, from pork to deer it teaches how to butcher. I read it a few times, I bought a whole lamb (with hide and guts) and I butchered it. I wouldn't say I made a work of art but all the cuts are there: back legs roasts. racks, riblets, roasts, trimmings. Don't expect instruction on fancy cuts: it's not the purpose of this book. The need of a power saw is slightly understated, though. If you butcher a large animal and you are not Hulk-sized, you may want to get one ... Absolutely recommended.	2005-04-17

Sandra Ingerman embraces Harner's shamanic idea of a lower, middle and upper world (not a surprise for she is one of Harner's students). I have no problem with that. However this book could be entitled \\"Shamanism: over-simplification made easy\\". It may be used to explain shamanism to 5th graders. If this is what you want, the book is good. For beginners I strongly recommend Cowan's \\"Shamanism: As a Spiritual Practice for Daily Life\\". It's a vastly more complete, yet simple.	2005-04-17

The chapter about resources is truly excellent. However, this book won't take you much further from the basics, in my opinion. The colour plates are beautiful, but they are just a handful (8 pages). Black and white pictures  don't make much sense here, after all this book is about orchids, right?   In the same price range I strongly recommend \\"Growing orchids\\" by Rittershausen, which contains almost the same information of more expensive books, and shows hundreds of colour pictures of very good quality. If you are willing to spend a little more, buy either \\"Understanding orchids\\" or  \\"Orchid's grower companion\\". Here you are paying for the \\"for Dummies\\" trademark. This book would be a good buy at half of the price.  As of now, all the 5 stars reviews have been written by people with ONE review in their accounts. Ask yourself \\"how come?\\"	2005-03-28

This book is one of the best buy in its price range. It contains about the same information that you find in 40$ books and the quality of the colour pictures (there's is a zillion of them) is almost as good. I really can't understand why it scores so low in terms of selling rate. The beginner can use it as a starter. This book can be used by the intermediate orchid lover as well: it contains everything to get well established in this hobby. Highly recommended. An excellent alternative to this book is \\"the complete guide to orchid's\\" By Ortho books.	2005-03-28

This book has been written by ex convicts of federal prisons. They have been living part of their lives \\"at the edge\\". In my opinion, they know what they are talking about. This book points out that most defensive techniques, that are widely taught nowadays, are totally ineffective.  <br />Also, this book points out that only a moron could deliver a knife attack the way 95% of martial artists normally do during training. Incidentally, this perspective is in perfect agreement with a survey of lethal knife attacks reported in an old issue of Black Belt Magazine.  <br />In conclusion, if you want to read about knife-combat by people with direct experience in the matter, buy it. If you like to think that you master the ultimate knife fighting just because your instructor told you so, don't buy it.	2005-01-29

While this is not a bad book, It's not a good one either. It is designed to make shamanism palatable to the vast public.

Within this framework, herbalists acknowledge the intrinsic sacredness of the plant medicine and act accordingly. This book is an excellent overview of this perspective.

The author's thesis is: water exposed to \\"positive\\" experiences makes beautiful, regular crystals, whereas water exposed to \\"negative\\" experiences, does not make crystals or it makes incomplete crystals\\". This concept reflects what homeopathic medicine is based upon. I don't have anything against it. However the author shows only ONE picture for each and every condition.   He shows pictures of water crystals which were formed in the presence of the word \\"thank you\\" in different languages. Undeniably the crystals exposed to \\"thank you\\", \\"danke\\" and \\"merci\\" ARE regular. Undeniably, the crystals exposed to \\"grazie\\" and \\"thank you in Chinese\\" are IRREGULAR. Just go see for yourself. Does it mean that Chinese and Italian are intrinsically rude languages? Tap water from most cities makes poor crystals, supposedly because of the chlorine. Water from a Yellowstone pool has poor crystals, too (not a surprise because Yellowstone water is extremely rich in mineral contaminants). Nonetheless the author attaches a positive meaning to it. The water crystal from Lake Maggiore in Norther Italy is beautiful. Well, I tell ya, Lake Maggiore is NOT a clean water and you can believe me because it's exactly were I come from. The water from the Fontana di Trevi in Rome makes round crystals thus resembling the coins that people throw in the fountain. To me it is indistinguishable from the round water crystal made under the influence of the word \\"satan\\" I mean, come on!	2004-12-04

Nowadays most people get their alcohol in the shops or bars. They go there, drop their cash, zip their plastic and get the stuff. It's that simple (and plain). Fact is for thousands of years the production of alcoholic beverages was the domain of shamans and priests, a realm that was magic, awe-inspiring and mystical. Alcoholic beverages were used in religious and healing ceremonies and in practices that would support bonding within the community. THIS BOOK CAPTURES ALL THIS.   I recommend this book also to those homebrewers who do not embrace this vision, because they'll find a great deal of inspiration for their concoctions. I am not sure all recipes are safe, but ... we can't live forever! Can we?	2004-11-25

Most of the times he plays the \\"I dunno nothing\\" kinda type of guy, only to surprise you with his keen knowledge of formal martial arts. That's part of his game, as it is clear that he had fun writing this book as much as the reader shall have fun reading it (provided that you can get along with the Me/Myself/andI attitude). The chapters about empirical psychology show that the author did his homework before writing. If you have been around the corner, you won't find much stuff that you really don't know. However, any black belt candidate should read this book, or an equivalent one, and demonstrate an adequate understanding of it before taking his/her test. If the black belt candidate is your young daughter, you may want to read the book yourself and give her an abstract ... if you know what I mean.	2004-08-15

The review system is somewhat mysterious to me. The best review on this book is \\"Secret art??\\" by a California reviewer. Nonetheless that review has a very poor feed-back. The reviewer said that this is Chi Gung and HE IS RIGHT! Just go get a couple of books about Chi Gung and see it for yourself. The author's claim that this is an UNIQUE art not are proven. The author says so but he doesn't prove it. The unique lineage he claims is not described at all. Author's claim that this is a 10000 years old art is ridiculous because the oldest writing records, the cuneiform, date back 5000 years. This having said, this is not a terribly bad book. If you you wrecked your body because of neglection, it may help you out. The author clearly knows about motivational arguments. The ninja-stuff art cover is really cool.	2004-03-31

To appreciate this book you MUST know what the author is talking about. Without such knowledge this book shall be a waste of time and money. I was planning to attend a workshop instructed by one of the author's foremost students and I was told to read this book, which I did. When I read it the first time, I seriously thought that it was one of the worst books I have ever come across and I decided not to attend the workshop. Through some odd twist of fate I changed my mind and actually attended the workshop. This has been my first practical experience in this field and I have no problem to state it has been an extremely rich one. Then I re-read the book and I realized that it's NOT a new agey, drug-inspired, empty sequence of words. On the contrary it's a down-to-business, very practical instructional instrument. It's almost like a cook-book. Again, as long as you know what it's talking about.<br />The book in itself is not written very well. It doesn't flow smoothly at all. The continuous quotations of the author's teachers make it a hard reading: after a while the &quot;me-Tarzan-you-Jane&quot; style gets on the nerves. In my opinion this book doesn't do the justice of this very fine lineage of shamanic pratictioners, instructors and healers. However, if you have been exposed to their instruction and need a text-book to go over their teachings, this is a must have.	2004-03-10

The matter is tidily presented. This book is CLEAR! It was written by a person who has CLEAR ideas in his mind. It delivers knowledge (which doesn't mean it'll make a shaman out of the reader, of course). It explains the difference betweeen a psychotic, a shaman and a shaman pratictioner. It explains why people may want to journey in the non-ordinary reality.  It is a book written for the reader. The only criticism I have is that journeying is presented as easy as eating breakfast. Potential problems are totally down-played.	2004-02-13

I practice the martial art called Aikido which brought me to get interested in the body energy (Ki/Chi). I also practice Chi-Gung and Tai-Chi. One of my Aikido fellows is a physical therapist and he frequently talks about native-american healers and non-ordinary state of reality. So in turn I became curious to know something about shamanism, even because I came to believe that all this \\"energy stuff\\" boils down to few principles regardless as to whether it is applied to combat or healing or whatever else.<br />I am in no way an expert in this specific field. This having said, I enjoyed reading this book even if English is not my first language. It is well written, and a part of it is very interesting. The author's path toward her meeting with the spirits is intriguing. Tension drops where the too many reports of trance experiences cease to be of general interest while eventually maintaining some relevance only to those who are deeply into this activities. The interpretation of the reports is down to a bare minimum.<br />On the other hand the author is rather self-involved and she fails to answer some questions someone like me would like to know the answer to. The healer/shaman needs to enter the otherworld to heal or to foresee the future or to fullfill an inner call, I understant that. But \\"WHY\\" would ordinary people want to enter a non-ordinary reality when they are not healers?  Trancers melt into the ground, fly with big eagles depending on the postures. So what? Is this kind of trance different from smoking pot? Could trance ecstasy still be relevant in our society as the author seems to suggest? The author states that in our modern society we use high-tech surrogates for our innate need of trance. I can buy that but is it proved? Does it mean that posture-induced trance, as opposed to LSD-induced trance, is brain-friendly and approved by DEA? By the way, is trancing  brain-friendly or can it fry someone's head? It eventually can as it is somehow connected to demonic possession. What is the real relationship between the use of allucinogenic substances (the mighty Sixties stuff) and shamanic extasy? The information contained in this book is very diluted and obliterated. The discovery that some postures can mediate ecstatic trance is extremely exciting but it doesn't take a whole book to tell that.<br />I am having the impression that Dr Goodman's main goal in writing this book it to prepare a fertile ground for her future grant applications.

After years of Aikido training I reached the conclusion that Japanese cannot articulate their thoughts about KI simply because, in so doing, they would have to admit that all the KI &quot;stuff&quot; comes from China. Even in this book Tohei sensei talks about positive and negative energy because he eventually doesn't want to use the terms Yin and Yang. This having said, this book offers an interesting perspective about the body energy as it is envisioned by Japanese. Tohei sensei reportedly is a man with immense KI. He is the only Great Master who received the 10th dan from O Sensei M. Ueshiba.<br />In conclusion, if you want a Japanese perspective on KI, buy it. If you are a beginner and want to get started on your inner energy cultivation, I strongly suggest you to buy &quot;Opening the Energy Gates of your Body&quot; By Kumar Frantzis. If you are experienced in this field ... well you already know what you want to do.	2003-10-07
US	49393976	R3K8IPII8OGE95	0007130902	211736398	The Big Book of Tai Chi: Build Health Fast in Slow Motion	Books	2	36	45	N	Y	Average book	In my opinion this is a rather plain book about Tai Chi. The author's deep knowledge clearly shows up. The problem I have with this book is that it is tailored to appeal a narrow section of the market: the prospective Tai Chi students. The book explains in great detail all the benefits one can gain from practicing TaiChi. However, it does not tell anything about \\"how\\". It is not an instructional book: it's mere Tai Chi propaganda. If you already practice Tai Chi and have just a decent knowledge about the energy in the body, you'll find this book only marginally useful. I am not saying that it's a terribly bad book. What I am trying to say is that from the author of \\"Opening the energy gates of your body\\" I expect much, MUCH more than that. I studied the \\"Gates\\" probably six times cover to cover, and countless times I consulted it to plan my Chi Gung training. I read \\"The big book of Tai Chi\\" once, and I don't think I'll read it again. Any average TaiChi student could write a similar book in 3 months: c'mon, Mr. Franzis, tell us something we don't know!!	2003-09-30

I love this book. I bought it in Italy when I was probably 15 and I have been reading it every few years ever since. When I came in the US at 38, I bought the English version. It is clean, it is romantic, it tells about a world we can only dream about nowadays. I study Tai Chi and Chi Gung, aside of my Aikido core-studies, and never find that my knowledge detracts anything from the beauty of this book.	2003-09-20

It is packed with smart and useful information. The forms are well explained. The relations between the forms and healing as well as martial application are clear and concise. The pictures, although not worth publication in National Geographics, are explanatory.	2003-09-15

In essence it's all you need to get started. Pictures in the similar book authored by B. Ciletti are better, whereas this book is a little more informative. I suggest that you buy one or the other.	2003-09-10

In itself this book teaches how to make cheese, however for the price you don't get much meat. The quality of the print is pathetic. With  2-3 more dollars you can buy Carroll's or Ciletti's book. I mean, it's like paying the same price for an old wreck or a brand new upper level car ...	2003-09-09

It shall serve you well in getting framed into the topic of Qi Gong. Dietary principles of Tao are very well explained and the chapters about tea are a true gem. The theory of the elements is clearly presented. It is a good starting point. A few paragraphs lure the reader into the use of body energy in different cultures. This topic is dropped too fast (bibliography is quoted should the reader be interested). <BR>Cleansing Chi Gung is presented very clearly.<br />However ChiGung standing practices (which are the very foundation of the whole businesss) are presented in a rather bland manner. In my opinion &quot;Opening the Energy Gates of your Body&quot; by B.K. Frantzis is infinitely better in this respect. Buy the &quot;Gates&quot; first.	2003-09-06
US	49393976	R2817XZGC0ZETK	1556434073	767605646	Relaxing into Your Being: The Taoist Meditation Tradition of Lao Tse, Volume 1 (The Water Method of Taoist Meditation Series)	Books	3	53	61	N	Y	Good book	All in all this is a good book. The matter is neatly presented and there is some interesting stuff about the fire and water taoist meditation. However, I think that this book doesn't present much information nor it delivers knowledge that is not present elsewhere. This book tastes like ... re-fried beans to me.<BR>Frantzis' &quot;Opening the energy gates of your body&quot; remains his unsurpassed masterpiece. If I had to save one single book about Chi, the &quot;Gates&quot; would be it.	2003-08-13

In my opinion, the authors did not consider that western people  LEARN in a way that is different from that of eastern people. There is a clear effort to teach, I just think that the method is wrong.<BR>Eventually the authors tried to put too many irons in the fire. It's not a bad book, it's just bland.	2003-07-19

This is essentially an autobiography. It's an easy and pleasant reading and it's a good book to have in a martial arts biblioteque. It tells about many martial arts that are not well known. Other than that, it does not deliver much knowledge and the title &quot;Combat Secrets of Ba Gua, Tai Chi, and Hsing-I&quot; is a sort of overstatement, in my opinion.	2003-07-19
US	49393976	ROHARVEDU5N4B	1556431643	631991186	Opening the Energy Gates of Your Body: Chi Gung for Lifelong Health (Tao of Energy Enhancement Series)	Books	5	92	102	N	Y	Outstanding!	I practice Aikido and over the years I heard an awful lot of meaningless bla-bla about KI. In my opinion the author is able to formalize concepts and convey his knowledge to the reader. Moreover, I began practicing the core exercises that he precisely explains in the book. As far as I can tell, all what he says in this book is true, and I feel the benefits. This apply not only to my back (that was injured a couple of years ago), but also to my Aikido training. I have the clear feeling of currents of energy flowing through my body. I am still a beginner in this field, but I know where I want to go, now.   This book (first printed in 1993 and still ranking 15000 on Amazon) is worth its weight in gold. It's a shame that the author did't follow through his promise of publishing similar books about \\"Dragon and Tiger\\", \\"Joining of Heaven and Hearth\\", \\"Bend the Bow and shoot the Arrow\\", \\"Spiraling Energy Body\\" and Gods playing in the Clouds\\". Instead he has been writing a bunch of mediocre books about clueless mumbo-jumbo Chi Gung ... stuff.   As for the new, expanded 2006 edition, it's certainly worth the few more dollars it costs. Disolving process is better explained and the  procedure is more clearly detailed. All the steps of the three swings and the spinal stretch are explained more clearly and with greater details. I am glad I bought this last edition to update the old one.	2003-03-13

It's a must read for anyone who has interest in martial arts. Many techniques of different martial arts acquire a completely different flavor after reading this book. This book won't transform you into a killing machine. Striking vital points, beside being dangerous, requires much practice and a very good knowledge of human anatomy.	2002-12-09

Almost all the photography books available out there deal with a lot of merely technical blabla. Shaw, on top of being technically rigorous, puts great emphasis on the artistic and creative aspects of nature photography. If you have time and will to learn, you'll find that each picture is a whole lesson. His way of writing is clean and straight, modest and never boring. I watch my own pictures before and after I went through his books: man, there is a difference!! I'd say that the vast majority of my slides are technically quite satisfactory but only a negligible minority is decent under the point of view of the composition. Shaw's books increased my capacity of critically evaluating a photograph. Sometimes I compare my pictures to those in some books or calendars and I'd say: mine are as good or even better than those. But sometimes  I step into a book of some really good photographer (Shaw's ones are among them) and I sadly realize that I'll probably never get there. Nonetheless this stimulates me to improve. Buy it.	2000-12-28

However, in my personal opinion, it could  have been written in half of the pages. Lecturing about the  \\"obvious\\" connections between molecular biology-quantum  physics-Aikido-cosmology-planet management sounds ... well, actually, it  does NOT sound to tell you the truth. On the  other hand, lecturing about the real meaning of budo is very good. Many  concepts here explained are deep. Although  it is not a technical manual, the notes about the spirit behind  some basic techniques are really interesting.	2000-08-27

Books	4	14	53	N	N	Good	This is a great example of how to write an intriguing science fiction book of the last generation.  As long as the FACTS are concerned, though, is has to be pointed out that TODAY no man on the Earth knows how to create new  lethal &quot;entities&quot; from the scratch. We know how to make more  lethal some bacteria or viruses but at the present we cannot invent brand  new ones which are as &quot;efficient&quot; as HIV or Ebola or many others  are. It is likely that, by learning more on these microorganisms in few  years we'll be able to create new killers, but  now this is not possible  and even less it was possible when HIV and Ebola first appeared. Now these  are the facts.  As a pesonal opinion, biowarfare is likely to be operated  by crazy terroristic groups and not by large military organizations. Why?  Because the bugs can be sampled, regrown and sent back to the sender. What  I see in many of the reviews is a j'accuse or a defence of ideological  concepts.	2000-06-25
