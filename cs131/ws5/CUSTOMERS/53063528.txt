In spite of the various elements of tragedy in the story, it is an uplifting book.  I purchased the audio version, and the reader, Anna Fields, is superb.	2005-08-28

It doesn't matter how good this book is - and it is a good reference - the binding is a joke.  Crummy weak wire is barely able to hold 1200 pages, making the book completely annoying.  Don't buy it unless you plan to keep it on your desk.	2005-07-16

Yes, there is a dark side to ADD (prison, alcoholism, unemployment...) but it's about time we heard about the strengths - intuition, creativity, the ability to connect with others, and the kind of risk-taking that changes lives for the better.  Thank you, thank, thank you. <br /> <br />If you'd like the unabridged version, it's available from Audible.com, and the reader, Dan Cashman, is superb.  The same abridged version read by Dr. Hallowell is also available.	2005-03-15

I've thoroughly enjoyed the story, as well as the superb reader (the book is available as an Audible download or on CD).  If you're looking for a good novel that's endless fun, you'll enjoy this book.  The descriptions and punning names made me laugh out loud.  Granted, I did look like a nutcase listening (and laughing) to this on my iPod in the grocery store, but who wouldn't laugh at the description of \\"Baby Face\\" the new at-home Botox injection that makes its unwitting users look like stroke victims?	2005-02-28

It's well worth the time and expense to read this book in addition to the assigned Dubin.  Thaler's text is clearly written, cleanly laid out, and easy to follow (no cutesy fill-in-the-blanks here).  The publisher deserves a lot of credit for careful editing and an elegant, logical layout. <br /> <br />Thaler presents each topic in a concise paragraph or two, with lots of white space for notes.  Criteria are given in straightworward lists, and are far easier to learn this way.  <br /> <br />Dubin is an authority on EKG interpretation, but his plodding teaching style just didn't work for me.  Both authors present reliable information in their EKG texts, but this is a perfect example of two books that use completely different teaching styles.  I'm glad I found Thaler's direct, detailed, concise text to learn this essential skill.	2004-12-13

The concepts are laid out in easy-to-follow steps, and the cases at the end of each chapter really help you integrate the concepts. <br /> <br />If you are looking for a clear introduction to this complex topic, you will find this book a superb guide.   I've enjoyed Acid-Base the most of the \\"Ridiculously Simple\\" series, and found it to be elegantly simple.	2004-12-07

He includes perfect examples of PP's shortcomings, and the shallow thinking and slim data in most PP presentations.  <br />I laughed aloud, hooting with amusement at his hilarious analysis.  You haven't lived until you've seen the wicked parody of the Gettysburg Address as a PP presentation, or the splendid Soviet cartoon.  We've all sat through (ok, we've given) these dreadful presentations.  Along with the humor are some solid suggestions for improving presentations, and communicating data more effectively.	2003-10-25

Many of the techniques are clearly EZ's (i-cord, for example) but not as clearly credited to her.<br />For the beginning knitter, this would be one of the best possible books you could choose, providing a mix of history, technique, and inspiration.<br />If you have a shelf full of books, or have knitted for decades, this might not be your best choice.<br />Either way, I wish her lovely shop were in my neighborhood!	2001-11-29

This book sheds helpful light on both sides of &quot;the couch.&quot;  Ms. Lott tackles a huge and disturbing subject with clarity and wisdom.  Her insights would have been very helpful in the early days of my social work training, and I suspect many women will be wiser consumers of mental health services if they have read this book.<br />This book includes information about some of the most serious mistakes clients and therapists make, but it isn't designed to treat those situations.  It will give you insight and understanding, as well as much-needed perspective.  You'll avoid problems, be more brave in the therapeutic process,  and understand the intense nature of the therapeutic relationship.<br />Buy two - one for you, and one for your client/therapist!	2001-11-29

Whether you are a therapist or client, you are sure to find these carefully chosen excerpts enlightening and amusing.  The volume Ms. Rabinowitz has woven from such disparate strands is one of the best I have ever read.  Each excerpt is strong enough to stand alone.  Many of the authors were new to me when I read Inside Therapy, but not any more.  I've looked for the original works, and been glad to meet such fine thinkers.<br />Samuel Shem's excerpt alone is worth the price of the book.  If you are not howling with laughter over his witty pokes at Freudian analysis... well, you might want to give more serious consideration to the role of therapy in your life.	2001-11-29

This one was a first for me. <br />Parker's protagonist, Wyatt Earp, sounds surprisingly like Spencer, and various other characters remind me strongly of Susan, Hawk, etc.  The dialogue that delights when spoken in Parker's Spencer series, sounds flat here.<br />Sadly, I don't think this Western book works, but I'll be eagerly awaiting his next mystery.	2001-06-26

It's a scattered book, without a clear focus or vision.  The book is full of Nice's work, exclusively, but it lacks freshness and inspiration, as if her editor had said, \\"Hey, art journals are hot... let's go through your material and publish a book!\\"     If you are an experienced journal writer and artist, you may find this a disappointment, too.  Those new to the subject would probably find this a good introduction, though Jason Thompson, Clare Walker Leslie, and Dan Price's books are far more inspiring.  This one is disappointing; it lacks freshness, inspiration, and point of view.	2001-06-09

This small book is full of his simple and inspiring observations, and his lopsided drawings.  Beautifully printed and bound.<br />If you're looking for detailed sketches or deep philosophical discussions, forget it.  If you're looking for a book that is one man's thoughtful reflection on daily life, this is it.  It's hard to imagine a recipient - from funky teen through grumpy uncle - who wouldn't enjoy this wonderful book.	2001-06-09

Kanbo has perfectly rendered the addled stupor of the exhausted mother, the new father who thinks time with his own child is &quot;babysitting&quot;, the bizarre conversations one has with rabid gamers, and the depths of true friendship in &quot;the Motherhood.&quot;  <br />If you haven't had four babies in five years, raised three of them to be gaming teens, found the friendship of other mothers your lifeline - you just might not see the humor in this gem.

Philip Gulley's writing style is full of dry wit that makes me laugh out loud and insist that those near me listen to a funny section.  Who could resist the Live Free or Die Sunday School class; Frank, the secretary who hangs up on callers he doesn't like; Miss Rudy's flinch when she hears of Jesus healing the ten &quot;leapers&quot;? On a more serious note, grace , sorrow, and redemption are woven through his stories.  If you are looking for superbly written stories, this book would be the perfect choice.	2001-01-28

This book goes beyond simple encouragement to show the reader the delight and freedom of journal-keeping, and its value to both the keeper and the reader.<br />I faulted it one star because the book needs both a bibliography and an index; perhaps Professor Johnson was afraid these would make the book seem too academic.
