Cooper's first fantasy novel features Julia Morton, a gymnast and strong favourite for a place in the British Olympic team. Julia has big plans for her life and is training hard to achieve them, when she is kidnapped and transported to another world. Lord Keverin is desperate for help to save his people from an invading army. Lord Mortain, a sorcerer and tyrant, is determined to increase his power by conquering Deva, but to do that he must first defeat Keverin who holds a fortress that has never fallen.<br />Deva used to have strong magic to defend it, but centuries have passed since that time. Keverin has his best friend cast a spell to summon a powerful mage to help him. The result of this spell is that his friend dies, Julia Morton is trapped on an alien world with no way home, and no mage to help them. Most of this book takes place in Athione, a huge fortress under siege. The last third does branch out into Deva to show us other places, but all the most important stuff happens in the first half of the book. I found the ending a little abrupt. It was satisfying in its way, but felt a little too quick.<br />Since reading this book, I have read the other two. The second one, called The Power That Binds, is the best in my opinion. It reads slower, which I like. I'm looking forward to book 4.	2004-02-16

He is brought up by the local priest--Father Max, in a post apocalyptic world where the alien Kuriens now rule.<br />The Kuriens are immortal beings that sustain themselves by feeding on auras of living beings. All living things have an aura, like a magnetic field that surrounds them. The more intelligent the animal, the more powerful the aura. For instance, a monkey being much more intelligent than a cow gives off a very rich aura that the Kuriens need, and then there is man. Humans are a perfect diet for Kuriens, but there's a problem. Humans don't want to die to feed the aliens and insist on fighting back :)<br />Kuriens are adept at manipulating genetic codes to create useful animals. They create various monsters that humans collectively call Grogs, and then there are the Reapers--vampire like creatures that suck the blood of their victims and pass on auras to their Kurien masters. These creatures are deadly, but thankfully there is an answer even in a world where 80% of the world's population has been eradicated by the release of Kurien enhanced plagues. Lifegivers.<br />The lifegivers are descended from the same race as the degenerate Kuriens, but they are good guys. They give humans a chance to fight the Kuriens by enhancing a select few. They create the Wolves, the Cats, and the Bears to lead the fight against the Kuriens.<br />David Valentine becomes a Wolf and fights humanity's enemy. We follow him into various dangers and see him win through. I can't praise this book highly enough. It's very different from any vampire book I've read before and benefits enormously from that.<br />Excellent!	2003-12-23

Tinker, his latest book, proves that he is here to stay.<br />Tinker is young human woman living in Pittsburgh. She runs her own scrap yard for a living, invents and builds her own gadgets, and is incidentally a genius where hyperphase gates are concerned. Her murdered father was the inventor of the Chinese hyperphase gate in orbit of earth. Its activation twenty years ago, resulted in the veil effect which transported Pittsburgh to ElfHome and a huge section of virgin forest to Earth in its place.<br />One night, Tinker is working in her yard when a pack of magically enhanced dogs called wargs, chase the viceroy (an elf named Windwolf) into her yard determined to kill him. Tinker intervenes and saves his life. As a result, Windwolf owes her a life debt. When he gives her a gift, she doesn't realise that he is proposing marriage. She accepts his gift, and later agrees to a spell that will &quot;prevent her death&quot; (or so he says) without realising that she is agreeing to be turned into an elf!<br />Tinker is wonderfully inventive. I particularly like the idea of Shutdown when the hyperphase gate is turned off once a month so that Pittsburgh reverts to earth for twenty four hours. Buy this book, and pray for a sequel.<br />Reviewed by Mark E. Cooper<br />The Warrior Within	2003-12-19

There her father plans to sell his cargo and with the profits, make a good marriage for his sons and daughters.<br />Katla has no wish to marry anyone. She wants to remain free to climb the cliffs and rocks that she loves and create beautiful knives and swords with her talent as a smith, but when she arrives at the Allfair and climbs the rock her people call Sur's Castle, she unwittingly sets unforeseen events into motion that might see her burned at the stake and war between bitter rivals.<br />This story was huge in its vision. Katla is a wonderfully captivating character, as are her brothers and father. Saro Vingo is another character that we feel drawn to. This book deserves its four stars, but the fifth I withheld because there was simply too many good characters. I know that sounds weird, but there were so many different points of view in this book and so many character switches, that I was in danger of getting lost.<br />Jude Fisher is one talented lady. She would have had all five stars if she had limited the point of view to a handful of characters instead of two handfuls and more. Buy this one now, and then hurry on to the second book called Wild Magic... I'm starting it tonight.	2003-12-17

When I awoke, I had to finish it ASAP. One thing though. I have to agree with the others when they say that the people of Fallbrook, for the most part, didn't deserve Aren.

Long after reading this series, you will remember him and his friends as they battled the Earth Alliances for the freedom of the colonies.<br />You have to get this... but then you already know that right?

US	53030447	R3AFLOGWMWGZIJ	0061059722	413464205	Brothers in Arms	Books	4	1	1	N	N	A conflict of loyalties	Scott St. Andrew is a cadet in the elite South Point Military Academy where he is training to become an officer in the Seven Systems Guard Corps. Scott and his brother Jarrett entered the academy to escape the mines on their home colony of Gatewood-Callista, but Scott is a gennyboy (someone with a genetic defect) and is considered unworthy to be there by many of the other cadets.<br />When war breaks out between the Earth Alliances and the colonies, choices have to be made, but Scott believes whole heartedly in the Code and does not want to break it even to support the colony that is his homeworld. Circumstances overtake him however, and he is forced to undergo the Racinian conditioning three years ahead of schedule so that he can fight in the war.<br />When Exeter is invaded and the academy taken, Scott and a number of other cadets make a break for it. In the process, many of them are killed but Scott, Paul, Halitov and others steal a ship and escape. Upon landing at a base on a far colony, Scott is summarily promoted to 2nd lieutenant and thrown into the deep. He is given troops and a mission to perform, which he does despite a mutiny. Then he is promoted again! Scott is bewildered. One year on from joining the academy, he is a captain and leading men into battle despite his fears and insecurities.<br />This is an action packed and fast paced book. A little too fast in my opinion. From cadet to captain in less than a year? The book felt very rushed... good, but rushed. This one has more action within its pages than perhaps three normal books and the promotion thing stretches believability too far.<br />If you can ignore the tempo of promotions, which you can if you like mil sci-fi as much as I do, you will fing this one well worth buying. :¬)	2003-11-07

Julia had been abducted from the capital of Deva by the sorcerer Demophon, but Julia's coming has been eagerly awaited by Shamen of the Camorin Clans. When Demophon attempts to take her north to General Navarien, his company is attacked by the clansmen and Julia taken from him. Julia decides to stay with the clans and help them against Navarien when he begins to march south.<br />This book is somewhat shorter and slower paced than the previous two. It has less politics than the second book, and more action. There's quite a lot more about the clans and other countries of Waipara too. All in all, I enjoyed it.	2003-11-05

In fact, she wanted nothing to do with him. Growing up in the mountains of Ketura taught her how to survive almost anything--even her clumsiness. She trains herself to be more careful than all the others, better than all the others, stronger than them and quicker, because not to do so would be death in the cold unforgiving mountains of Ketura. As the years pass, she becomes confident in her hunting and tracking abilities, and happy... until her mother dies and reevers try to desecrate her body.<br />Kelyn is told by someone she trusts that to find herself and her destiny, she must find the father she despises. Wolverine had left before she was born, left her mother to fend for herself. She wants nothing to do with him... and yet, to leave the mountains for adventure in far away lands has a strange appeal.<br />Kelyn did not wait for trouble to find her, instead she uses a talisman that she took from the dead reevers to go looking for it! She knows from stories of the Wolverine that wherever there is trouble, Wolverine won't be far behind. She finds trouble aplenty, and her father, but he isn't what she expected at all.  The Wolverine is a hard battle scarred warrior, just as she had thought he would be, but he is also what she would call a cocker (a foolish male or idiot) When she declares herself his daughter, he doesn't believe her! Then she learns  he is fighting for the very people he professes to despise--witches.<br />Well, Kelyn couldn't leave it there. She had to tell him what a fool he was, but he won't believe anything she says... until she forces him to see the truth and everything changes. Suddenly, her lifelong clumsiness is gone. She learns that far from being a simple matter of clumsiness, she was under a curse--making her father acknowledge her as his daughter has broken its hold on her... or has it?	2003-10-30

The Lazelle family have magic powers. Gyp watches her two older siblings go through the transition (a serious illness where you either die, or gain your powers) and is expecting it to be her turn any time now, but when her younger brother becomes sick, it is obvious the transition has passed her by.<br />Gyp is devastated not to go through transition. It changes everything. She quickly finds herself resenting her family for their good fortune and eventually leaves for boarding school. Years pass, and Gyp learns to live with being normal until one day in her twentieth year, she falls terribly sick... :¬)<br />This book was a simple story about Gyp's relationships with her family and friends and how they change when she finally receives her powers. Transitioning so late, means that she didn't complete her magical studies and now needs to learn everything quickly. Also, a late transition means she is very powerful indeed... VERY. Worst of all, her power turns out to be a Dark Power--the power of curses. Magic must be used or Gyp risks death, but that means she has to curse someone or something three or four times per day EVERY day forever. Talk about a fun premise. Who or what would you curse?	2003-10-30

Another reviewer said this is a masterpiece and compared it with the Honor Harrington series. Far be it from me to tell another reviewer what to say, but this book is not in the same league as Weber's Harrington series. That's not to say it isn't a good book, because it is. There are very few books to compare to the Harrington series, not being one of them is no shame.<br />Cherijo is now living aboard the Jorenian ship Sunlace on her way to Joren--her adopted people's homeworld. but her evil father and creator isn't giving up that easy. League warships and mercenary vessels constantly attack the Sunlace trying to retrieve Cherijo, while aboard the ship itself there is a series of murders. Time is running short for Cherijo as she struggles to patch up the injured Jorenians while dodging attempts on her life. She has more than enough to do, but it seems she is the only one who can solve the mystery of who is sabotaging the Sunlace and killing her crew.<br />A good book, but the series does benefit from reading them in order.

It's not so much that this story is about alien conflict, the story takes place twenty years after Earth is conquered, but rather about how humans and aliens learn to live and fight together for their common survival. What I found so great about this was the way the authors wove alien customs and thought processes into the story. The Jao were truly believable and there actions and motives came across as alien rather than being human with just an alien flavour as so many sci-fi novels seem to do.<br /><br />Well worth the hardback cover price.	2003-10-17

I read it in one sitting and followed it with the second book--Tenth Planet: oblivion. What can I say? These books are pure escapism. It's a simple story that goes something like this:<br /><br />An archaeologist notices a black layer in one of his digs. He doesn't think anything of it at first. Forest fires in ancient times do leave such layers only not as thick, but when he notices the exact same thing at the same depth in two other sites, he becomes intrigued and begins to investigate. What he finds is horrifying. The black ash isn't ash at all and isn't caused by fire.<br /><br />It seems that every 2006 years, something happens to cause those black layers in which all organic life dies--EVERY 2006 years, and guess how long the last one was... you got it! Now he's in a race against time to make his government aware that something from space is coming, and in less than a year!<br /><br />Great fun.	2003-10-09

They did not, however, spoil my enjoyment of this story. I wish Molly Mcoll had been used more, she was in the story quite a bit, but seemed to lack something. The author seems to have preferred her sister, Lauren, over her. We see much deeper into Lauren's life than we ever do Molly's. I found myself disliking the sentinels--too sanctimonious for my liking. Also, the bad guys were glossed over severely. The three rogue sentinels seem to have zero character and zero motivations (except maybe simple greed) for their actions. I just didn't believe in them.<br /><br />Ah... but the world of the Vodi and Veyar. That worked brilliantly for me. I loved the setting and is one of the big reasons I give this book four stars and not three. The veyar as a people were interesting, the idea of a Copper House to shield the occupants from magic was good. The Vodi's necklace... excellent again. The only thing really wrong with this book was the weak bad guys. They seemed like generic opportunists and were only in the book to give the good guys something to do.<br /><br />Overall, this was an enjoyable and quick read but it came across as a simple introduction to book two.

The story begins a day after book one ends with Molly Mcoll, the Vodi, arisen from the dead. Luaren, her sister that she never knew, has returned to Earth with her son Jake and the other sentinels. She grieves for the sister she believes is dead, but a messenger sent from downworld soon has Lauren betraying the sentinels and charging back to her sister's side.<br /><br />Holly Lisle still seems to prefer Lauren over Molly, as she did in the first book, but this time she abandons the sentinels on Earth where they belong to concentrate on Lauren's relationship with her sister and with Molly's resurrection. Molly is alive, but her soul now resides in heaven--gone to its eternal rest and reward. The reserected Molly believes her life is empty of meaning now that she has died and come back without her soul, but worse that this, she believes she is now kin to the dark gods. The dark gods are evil and they get worse and worse the more times they are killed and resurrected. Molly fears for the future.<br /><br />And she is right to fear, for one of the dragon-like \\"Rhon\\" has a plan to make Molly into a dark god in his image. He will kill Molly over and over bringing her back each time to suffer death anew, until there is nothing of the old Molly Mcoll remaining.<br /><br />I gave this four stars because I enjoyed reading it. It was fast paced and an easy read, but it suffered from using Lauren's point of view too much. I wanted, and still do want, more about Molly. The sentinels might as well not have been in this book. Pete is given a fairly interesting set of scenes to play, yet they seem to have no relation to the first book and feel redundant to me.<br /><br />Buy the book, but be aware that this is book 2 of a series. Go into this one expecting loose ends to remain flapping in the breeze.	2003-10-09

I've got to read it.\\"<br /><br />Well I did read it and was ultimately disappointed. I have two categories of book that I apply to those I buy: Keepers (books I can read over and over and will never let go) and forgetables (read once and give away) This one from Ash is a forgetable.<br /><br />The ideas were there and sound, but somehow they didn't quite click for me. Gavril Andar's relationship with the Drakhoul wasn't explored enough for me. Ash simply began making Gavril change and do things while making him bemoan his fate and look desperatley for a way out. The fact he was an accomplished painter had no bearing on the story after about the third chapter. He could have been a blacksmith or a bard and it would have made no difference to what happens. Gavril's link to his men wasn't used hardly at all except to say that Gavril tried and failed to contact them when he was in need.<br /><br />The story came across to me as very light weight, when it could have been epic. All the ideas were there. A world discovering science but still having practitioners of magic, demon creatures, sword wielding soldiers that are also learning to use firearms for the first time... It could have been great, but suffered from \\"first in a trilogy syndrome\\" meaning all set up and no real substance. I hope the second book makes up for it.<br /><br />Buy this if you can't find anything new in fantasy to read, otherwise wait for book 2.	2003-09-15

I really enjoyed the idea of a wizard trying to make a living (almost unsuccessfully) in our modern world. It tickled me that someone so powerful was beset by the same problems the rest of us are faced with -- namely, paying the bills!<br /><br />Harry Dresden is a good guy with problems of his own when a gangster pulls up in his car wanting to hire him. Now Harry is in need of money right enough, but he's also basically an honest kind of guy. He turns the gangster down flat and basically makes an enemy he could do without. Things progress with Harry stumbling into one sticky situation after another often with laughable consequences. I particularly like the skull-with-an-attitude on his shelf.<br /><br />Great book. Buy it and all the others in this series. You'll love them!	2003-09-15

The Fortress in the Eye of Time is a book that you will enjoy reading the tenth time as much as you did the very first.<br /><br />Excellent story telling.	2003-09-15
US	53030447	RXBHHS2D17LKE	0812521374	444699614	Necroscope	Books	5	2	3	N	N	Truly an original story idea	I have often considered reading Brian Lumley but until now I have always put off buying his books. It always seemed to me that Lumley wrote pure horror (not my favourite) but despite appearances (his book covers) Necrosope is not a simple horror story. I would class this as a paranormal thriller.<br /><br />Harry Keogh is a very special boy that grows into a talented man. He can speak to the dead and they listen! This makes him a Necroscope, a valuable resource to the British Secret Service. Just imagine, an agent is killed with vital information that the British needs. What do they do? Call Harry!<br /><br />The book is full of great ideas that I have never read about. There are departments within the Russian and British secret services that use ESP to track nuclear Subs, predict the future, question the dead, kill with the evil eye!<br /><br />Since reading this story, I have bough every single one of Lumley's books. That's how much I enjoyed this story.	2003-09-15

I expected Birget to be whisked away to another world, well okay she was, but I didn't expect it to take nearly a third of the book!<br /><br />A slow start isn't so terrible, but Birget is supposed to be this woman with an amazing capacity for magic. Great! I like that kind of thing, but when I read this I found everyone BUT Birget doing it! She is supposed to be the heroine of the story and she hardly does anything!<br /><br />The two sorcerers Kilami and Sakra steal the show. Kilami is a bad guy and is well fleshed out, and Sakra is the good guy. To my mind Sakra is the hero not Birget and should have gotten top billing. Birget could have been so much more, but the way she is written she comes across as a waste of space! If she is to be the heroine, shouldn't she be heroic? At least she should DO something instead of watching the world go by!<br /><br />By the way, the second book (Usurper's Crown) is a waste of time. Don't buy it unless you like prequels. It is about Birget's mother and just rehashes everything revealed in this book about Ingrid and Avanasy all be it in greater detail.	2003-09-15

In this book, Devlin (or the Chosen One) is tasked with finding a special sword that was lost during the invasion of his country by the empire he now serves. This means that Devlin, who is an outcast among his people and called kinless, must confront those he once knew as friends.<br /><br />I gave this four stars on the strength of the first book, which is very good indeed. This one is less good, but still satisfying. It's obvious from what happens in this book that Devlin's adventures are far from over. I'm looking forward to the third book in this series.	2003-09-15

The idea of a person being able to teleport from place to place is not new, but it still has the power to fascinate. Just think, what would you do if you could jump from one side of the world to another just by concentrating upon a photograph of your destination?<br /><br />David Rice can do just that as he learns quite by accident during a moment of heightened stress when his abusive father attacks him. We follow David as he learns what he can do, but not why he can do it. This frustrates him until he becomes distracted by other events. He robs a bank, gets a girlfriend older than him, finds his estranged mother, loses the girl, loses the mother, gets the girl again, tracks down a bunch of terrorists.... phew! David sure is busy in this book and I love it! Oh yeah, he makes a fool out of the FBI and police at nearly every turn... great!<br /><br />Jumper is simply great fun. Once you pick it up, you'll not want to put it down until the last page is read. When you've finished it, you'll want to put it somewhere safe. I guarantee you'll want to read it again.	2003-09-15

He lives with his mother and grandfather who is also a herder. His father was killed during his compulsory enlistment in the Iron Valley's militia.<br /><br />This sets the scene for a wonderful adventure. Herders are men and women apart in that they have Talent with a capital T. They need this special mind power to keep their flocks safe from sandwolves on the Quarosote plains. These creatures are deadly dangerous and swift, so herders have to be crack shots too. Alucius is VERY Talenented indeed, which as with all herders, he is at pains to hide. If it became known, the traders of the Iron Valley Council would stop at nothing to claim him for their use. He would never be free of them.<br /><br />When it is time for his enlistment in the militia, he puts on his nightsilk underwear (bullet proof silks that are woven from the fleece of Nightsheep) takes his horse (Wildebeast) and his rifle, and walks into history.<br /><br />The above is only a very sketchy description of the beginning of this excellent book. Alucius becomes first a scout, something his grandfather advised him to try for so that he could use his talent to protect himself without being obvious about it, then later after many battles, he becomes a squad leader, a prisoner, a Maitrite soldier forced to fight for his enemy, and finally a captain of escaped prisoners bent on returning to the Iron Valleys.<br /><br />Wonderful book!	2003-09-15
US	53030447	R191793GHHFFNC	0954512200	706606076	The Warrior Within (Devan Chronicles)	Books	5	2	6	N	N	Excellent story	I give this five stars because although this is book 3 of a five book series, it doesn't suffer from what I call &quot;middle book syndrome&quot; You know what I mean... the first book usually sets up the plot, the second is full of action, the third nearly always just marches in place until the fourth one comes along. Thankfully that doesn't happen in this series. Each book has a beginning, middle, and end. So although they should be read in order, none of them are simple placeholders. All of them progress the story.<br />I'm looking forward to Dragon's Dawn--book four of this series.	2003-09-07

Its a waste of time. Don't buy it unless you like prequels. It is about Birget's mother and just rehashes everything revealed in this book about Ingrid and Avanasy all be it in greater detail.	2002-12-04
US	53030447	R1A0WUF4DYWWZD	0759901880	601328728	Wolfkin	Books	5	1	1	N	Y	Delve into a world of shapeshifters and magic	Wolfkin really grabbed me. I read the book in one sitting and found myself wishing for another to continue Yozerf's tale. Yozerf was my favourite character, I always loved the idea of shapeshifters, but Suchen's part in the story was good too.<br /><br />I was shocked at what happened to Rozah, it really surprised me, which is unusual in a lot of fantasy. Some of the books I have read are so obvious that two chapters in I know what's going to happen in the end. Not so with Wolfkin.<br /><br />Get this book, you'll love it.	2002-11-01

The layout makes finding what I need easy. It resides beside my computer and is never out of reach.<br />It's a shame this book is no longer in print. I have one or two other name books (nothing as good as this one) but they may be of interest. The first is called The Name Book by Dorothy Astoria--There is some good stuff in this, and the little quote with each name is a nice touch. The second is presumptuously called The Only Baby Name Book You'll Ever Need and is by Heidi Overhill. This one includes with each entry the names and dates of birth of famous people named for that entry.	2002-07-11
