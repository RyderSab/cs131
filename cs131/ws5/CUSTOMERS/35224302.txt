Races and cities rise and fall, lots of good folks just inexplicably go \\"mad,\\" and that's all before the art!  No, actually, I don't.<br /><br />Warcraft is written by a guy whose imagination is in overdrive.  If this is a trilogy, and not a thirty-volume manga, such a background story was really uneccesary.  What saves this manga is the art.<br /><br />Korean artist Jae-Hwan Kim draws really exciting art.  You feel like you are in the story.  Kim has an incredible sense of space, dimension, and proportion.  The characters designs and clothing are to die for.  The men are men's men, but wear intricate clothing and armor.  The women are beautiful, with lovely clothes.  Forests and mountains don't look like backdrops, but like the real thing.  You can almost smell the pine trees.<br /><br />Richard A. Knaak has a \\"knack\\" for storytelling, when the manga finally begins.  It is a good tale of good vs. evil in a fantasy land.  Dragon Kalec has taken human form when he is attacked by a band of orcs led by a dragon-hating dwarf.  Injured, Kalec is led to safety by a beautiful, naiive peasant girl named Anveena.<br /><br />Anveena is so dumb, she makes TV's Crank Yanker's Special Ed look like a genius.  (Yay!)  If she were as ugly as she is stupid, Kalec would run like hell.  As it is, she is very pretty, and Kalec feels a bond with her, even though he is engaged to the Dragon Tyrl.  Tyrl is smart, beautiful, and arrogant.  Soon they are engaged in bloody, (well-drawn) battles with orcs and the undead.  Seeing someone fighting with his guts hanging out is pretty cool.<br /><br />I would get this trilogy just for the art.	2005-10-13

The volume contains two stories; one is about three quarters the length of the book, the other the last quarter.<br /><br />The first story has Kohaku and the demon Koryu travelling back in time to unravel the mystery of the disappearance of Shuichiro's mother twenty-one years ago.  K & K are in their chibi forms throughout, which is a little too cute.  Added to this cuteness is Shuichiro's adorable doll-like mother, who is not human.  There are so many flowers drawn in this story I got allergies.  In a modern version of the folktale where a human man marries a celestial being, this Wish story has an unfortunate incestuous twist that is a total gross-out.  Shuichiro says to his mother as she is preparing to leave, \\"I need you.  You're the only one for me.  What if I had found you? Before Dad?\\" EWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  What was CLAMP thinking?!?!?  CLAMP is known for delightful, SUBTLE homo-romanticism, but how could they think readers would be turned on or charmed by this?<br /><br />The other story is also a little too cute.  Kohaku is still a whimpering, crying chibi for most of the story.  Thankfully, this is balanced somewhat by the other sexy couple that has also taken up residence with Shuichiro.	2005-10-12

Pamela is the young owner of the Tarot Cafe, set in downtown London, where customers come to have their cards read.  But some customers aren't human.<br /><br />San-Sun Park creates delicate figures and incredibly detailed art that will have you oohing and aahing.  This is a Korean manga, and the little sound effects you see are the Korean script, not Japanese.<br /><br />Volume One of Tarot Cafe contains three full stories and the beginning of a fourth, which is continued in Volume Two.  In the first story, a special cat falls in love with a human.  This story is along the lines of The Little Mermaid, and some would say it was a ripoff, but it will touch your heart nonetheless.  The second story is a \\"tribute\\" (again, some will say ripoff) of Interview With a Vampire.  Set in Paris, a vampire has fallen in love with a human, with tragic consequences that have carried on three hundred years into the present.  Third, a sprite with an attitude seeks to lift a curse so she can return home to marry her fiancee.<br /><br />The last story is about a Gepetto-like alchemist.  Seeking to capture the heart of a beautiful princess, he has created a living doll to entertain her.<br /><br />Don't delay in buying Tarot Cafe.	2005-10-07

The art is simple, yet imaginative and skilled.  The story is about a shy junior high school girl named Noriko who accidentally finds herself in a strange and fantastic land.  Her only companion is a handsome, mysterious warrior named Izark.  Noriko must learn to trust Izark completely, because she is completely helpless, lacking any fighting or athletic skills, and she does not speak the native language.  Nor does Izark speak hers.<br /><br />Izark knows why Noriko has come to his land, but she does not.  He refers to her as something called The Awakening.  But far from being benevolent, The Awakening is supposed to awaken the Sky Demon, and bring destruction to the land.  Izark knows Noriko might have to be killed.  But he knows she is innocent, and feels compelled to help her.<br /><br />Throughout the book, several more hunks are introduced, including the slightly androgynous and divinely gorgeous Lord Rachef (ok, the names in this book aren't very good) and a blond trader who helps Noriko and Izark.<br /><br />The art is clever.  The series reminds me of a good cartoon you might see from the 70's or 80's on American Saturday morning TV, rather than a modern anime.<br /><br />Lacking in this book is any kind of bio of or notes by the author. Most mangas have periodic sidebars where the author writes informative entries.  Here there is absolutely no clue to the person behind the art and story.  It feels like it was written by a ghost.	2005-10-06

Wish - Volume One - by the renowned all-female manga studio CLAMP seems a simple, preteen story at first.  In a blatant copying of the goddess Belldandy in both character design and storyline, we have an angel come to earth to grant a wish to a handsome young man.<br /><br />Kohaku became stuck on a tree at night, when she lost her true form.  Shuichiro, a handsome young surgeon, rescues the cherub from some crows.  Shuichiro seems to be an agnostic.  He has no need for matters of faith, or a desire for a wish that Kohaku wants to grant him for saving her life.  Kohaku follows him home.  In the morning, she morphs into her true form, a lovely angel.  Still passive and unresponsive, Shuichiro leaves for work.  Kohaku decides to stay with him until he gives her a wish she can grant.<br /><br />The story may sound predictable, but during the second half of the book, the plot thickens.  Several demon characters are introduced, including a lovely master angel and the crown prince of Hell.  If you can sit through all the \\"rules\\" angels and demons must abide by (angels can't eat anything living, plant or animal; demons cannot go into Heaven, angels can't cross into Hell), you will be rewarded with a naughty twist that seems out of place in this saccharinely-sweet manga.<br /><br />In Wish, angels and demons \\"do not have gender as we know it.\\"  So the figures are somewhat androgynous.  Angels are referred to as she, demons as he.  But there is a pair of clearly female cat demons.  Was it an author copout to make them \\"they\\" instead of \\"he?\\"<br /><br />I also do not like how the very thin/no hips/no ass angels & demons are criticizing each other for being \\"fat,\\" \\"round,\\" \\"bubble-butt.\\"  Can you say eating disorder, anyone?  This is inappropriate humour for shoujo manga, where so many girl readers suffer from lack of confidence about their body image.	2005-10-06

Christopher Paolini has an incredible imagination.  I disagree with all who say he copies.  Anyone who attempts fantasy with elves and dragons is going to be accused at some point of copying Tolkein. In Eragon, Paolini pays homage to several fantasy writers, most prominently Anne McCaffrey, author of The Dragonriders of Pern series.  I chalk all these negative reviews up to people who are jealous that they can't write like Paolini, and jealous of his immediate success.<br /><br />Eragon is a teenage boy living on his uncle's farm.  He hunts, and enjoys spending time in the mountains.  One day, he finds an odd blue object.  When it proves impossible to sell, he keeps it.  This strange blue object will lead him to his greatest friend and his greatest love.  Unfortunately, it also leads to a terrible tragedy.  Soon he is fleeing for his life.<br /><br />Eragon is assisted in his quest by the Gandalf-like Brom.  Brom is one of my favorite characters.  His wisdom is true and relevant.  It is impressive that such wise ideas came from a young man like Paolini.<br /><br />The book has some violent as well as gruesome imagery.  But as a true fantasy novel, you are drawn into another world, and eagerly follow Eragon's quest on the extensive map provided.<br /><br />I strongly disagree that this is a kids book.  I am looking forward very much to the live action Eragon movie due out in 2006.	2005-09-21

The evocative title and the glowing moon on the cover greatly piqued my interest.  Somehow, I just knew this would be a good story.  And I was correct.  Being from the Southwest, it was an extra delight to find the story is set in Southern California.  People don't usually associate the desert with ghosts, but there you have it.<br /><br />James Blaylock is an excellent writer.  He weaves a tale by bringing the setting and characters to life.  The story is about Peter, whose ex-wife  and young son have mysteriously disappeared.  The wife was leaving for Hawaii, and the police suggest she has run away in a custody dispute.  The mystery is further compounded by the recurring appearance of a woman and a boy in the windy canyons of Trabuco Oaks, where Peter and his new girlfriend Susan like to hike. Susan has a young son of her own.<br /><br />Susan has a fateful encounter with Pomeroy, a used-car salesman with illusions of his own grandeur.  He becomes obsessed with Susan.  Pomeroy has shady business dealings with Susan's next-door neighbor Klein.  Klein wants Pomeroy out of the way; Pomeroy wants Susan.  But everyone is touched by the strange apparitions, and things get out of control.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who likes a well-written mystery with a touch of the supernatural.	2005-08-31

But he prefers to be called \\"Joe.\\"<br /><br />Joe takes Christine on a journey of self-searching, self-purging, and self-discovery.  And even though it is forbidden, she falls in love with him.  That's ok. Heck, I was in love with him, too!  Joan Brady describes Joe so well, you expect to see him standing behind you when you close the book and turn around.<br /><br />This book is great for any woman who has been fruitlessly searching a long time for Mr. Right.  And, as the cover says, if you've ever had a broken heart, you will love this book.  Give this book to your girlfriends who have just got their hearts broken!  Regardless of your religious affiliation, this book will warm your heart and make you yearn to simplify your own life.<br /><br />Joan Brady is a great writer.

The author tackles the subject of what being Latina or Hispanic really means, not just the white perception of the term. She discusses and explores, through her characters, the many differences that exist between Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Mexicans, and Dominicans. While engrossing, however, the reader is left somewhat unsatisfied at the end. The resolutions are a little cliched, and it seems at times as though Valdes-Rodriguez wrote the book hoping for a movie screenplay. However, I did enjoy this book very much.<br /><br />The story is about six Hispanic women who have been fast friends since their college days. While very different in personality, background, careers, and lives, the women have resolved to get together twice a year to catch up, no matter what. When Elizabeth, a beautiful and popular local newscaster is outed by a jealous co-worker, the friends come to her defense. The \\"sucias,\\" or \\"dirty girls\\" in Spanish, do not share all their secrets, however. Some will come back to hurt them. What makes this story realistic is that the reader will not like all the sucias. Some will rub you the wrong way and you will want to slap them. Just like your friends in real life.<br /><br />Valdes-Rodriguez is a journalist who has written for the Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe. While the main character is Lauren, a newspaper columnist, Valdes-Rodriguez writes most convincingly about one of my favorite characters, Amber. Amber is a musician who is fiercely proud of her Pre-Columbian Aztec heritage. \\"We made love and listened to the deep green voice of the moon.\\" Damn, that is good writing (As a writer myself, as well as a moon aficionado, I am jealous of that line)! Another favorite character of mine is Usnavys, who reminds me of Star Jones (pre weight loss).<br /><br />There is a fair amount of non-translated Spanish in the book. While this will not hinder your understanding of the story in the least, I have seen in other reviews that it frustrates some non-Spanish speakers who cannot understand every word in the book.

When the series started, Hogwart's School of Wizardry was a magical place for the awestruck boy first learning of his magical heritage and ability.  He made new friends, met wonderful teachers and mentors such as Minerva McGonnagal and Albus Dumbledore.<br /><br />In Order of the Phoenix, Hogwart's is no longer a secure place.  Even the teachers are in fear for their jobs and the safety of Headmaster Dumbledore, as the sinister Dolores Umbridge takes over Hogwart's on authority of the Ministry of Magic.  Harry must rely only on himself, but he is truly venturing into insanity with his strange dreams that connect him to the mind of Lord Voldemort.  Harry also is increasing irrational and shouts at Hermione and Ron.<br /><br />Phoenix is a violent book, full of painful and sometimes fatal magic attacks on many beloved characters.  It is a book that holds your attention from beginning to end, but there are so many characters it is difficult to keep track of all of them.  The plot is complicated and unsettling.

Only a few citizens know what is really going on, and only their prayers and cleverness can save the souls of the town.<br /><br />Sally Roe is on the run, trying to get to the bottom of a mystery from her past.  She cannot come to police for help, for the police chief is in on it.  Ben, a deputy fired for defying the chief, and Marshall Hogan, the small-town newspaper owner from the previous book, will come to be her only help.<br /><br />That all sounds good, but where Peretti ventures in this book, I do not like at all.  I have a feeling he was confident from the success of This Present Darkness, and took his themes several steps further.  I am very uncomfortable with how he uses children in Piercing the Darkness.  While in the first book adults were possessed by demons of various names such as Hate, Depression, Murder, Lust, that was in keeping with the Bible.  Adults who stray from Christ fall prey to these demons, but must ask them in.  In Piercing, Peretti actually has very young children possessed by these evil spirits!  Peretti goes so far as to say that a whole gamut of behavioral disorders, from children acting up, to mental illnesses such as multiple personality disorder, or dissassociative disorder, are in reality demon possession!  This gross misinformation turned me off to reading any other books by Peretti.<br /><br />On Friday, August 22, 2003 at the Faith Temple Church of the Apostolic Faith in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, eight-year-old Terrance Cottrell, Jr., who suffered from autism, was wrapped in sheets and held down by church members during a prayer service held to exorcise the evil spirits they blamed for his condition.  If we follow Peretti's line of logic, it would lead straight to this boy's death.<br /><br />The final straw was when Peretti has the audacity to say that there is evidence people with Dissassociative Disorder actually have different vision and blood types when different personalities manifest.

I caught my husband reading it, and a sixteen year old boy I know read this volume in one hour.  The author of Alice 19th is Yu Watase, author of the blockbuster manga Fushigi Yugi: the Mysterious Play, and Ceres: Celestial Legend.<br /><br />The story is about Alice Sena, a shy and pretty short-haired high school freshman living in the shadow of her older sister Mayura.  Alice is in love with a dreamy junior named Kyo Wakamiya. Kyo spends a lot of time at the archery club, of which Mayura is also a member.  Trouble is, Mayura is also in love with Kyo.  Outgoing and confident, Mayura has no idea of the longing in Alice's heart.  That is because Alice keeps her feelings to herself to be accomodating to others.  She puts other's interests before her own.<br /><br />Here lies the appeal of this manga.  Alice is such a completely relatable character.  Haven't we all at some point grinned when our heart was breaking on the inside, because we didn't want to upset other people?  Haven't we all bent over backwards to help others when we needed help ourselves?  Alice has low confidence, even letting the school bullies drop notebooks on her head and pretending nothing is wrong.<br /><br />All this starts to change as Alice finds a white rabbit who begins to bring out her self esteem and slowly take charge in her life.  The similarity to Alice in Wonderland ends with the name and the white rabbit, though.  Alice soon discovers from the bunny that she has been chosen to be a Lotis Master, a wielder of powerful words connected with runes on beads on a bracelet that masters wear.  This is another theme of the story that is great.  Words are powerful.  We don't realize how powerful they are.  Words can be great weapons, or great methods of healing.<br /><br />One great thing about this manga is that the back has an index of sound effects in the story.  The list features each sound effect's English phonetic equivalent, and the meaning.

Laurie Halse Anderson did an amazing job researching this historical fiction about the Yellow Fever outbreak that plagued Philadelphia in the summer of 1793. Anderson has created characters I will never forget.<br /><br />The heroine of the book is fourteen year-old Mattie Cook. Her widowed mother owns a coffeehouse which the mother runs with Mattie's grandfather, an ex-Revolutionary War soldier. Mattie helps her mother with the daily chores, but longs for more in life. Mattie wants to take risks, follow her dreams and her heart. But her mother is very practical and not a dreamer.<br /><br />Suddenly, Philadelphia is in turmoil as thousands are dying from a horrible sickness. Mattie and her grandfather are separated from her mother. Mattie's bond with her grandfather is what made me bawl my eyes out, because they love each other so much. It reminded me of my own grandfather, now passed on.<br /><br />At the end of the book are fairly extensive notes of what occurred during the outbreak. Famous people mentioned in the story such as painter Charles Wilson Peale are profiled more extensively. It is also very touching and commendable that Anderson has incorporated the enormous contributions of African-Americans during that horrible summer. Eliza, the Cook's maid, is a main character in the book, and like family to Mattie.<br /><br />Fever 1793 should really be optioned for a movie.

Anyone who loved Mists will be delighted with this book, full of the same Druid mysticism and ancient Britainnian history.<br /><br />The story is about Elian, and how she falls in love with a Roman soldier, torn between her love for him and her duties as a chosen priestess of the Forest House, a house where vestal virgins worship the goddess. The setting is when the Romans occupied what is now England, and ruled with an iron fist all of the native peoples, including Elian's family of Druids. The Druids have a tolerate-hate relationship with the Romans, mostly hate.<br /><br />There are many fascinating characters in this book. The research that went into both this and Mists is staggering. To me it is amazing that Marion Zimmer Bradley had time to write both of these books in her lifetime.	2005-01-13

The language is archaic, but the story is so compelling I just rushed through the book with no problems.<br /><br />The story is about the passionate love between mismatched Catherine and Heathcliff.  Catherine is beautiful and refined, but underneath the ladylike exterior, she shares the same wild and free spirit as her soulmate.  Heathcliff is one of the most complex characters of literature.  You either love him or you hate him.  Indeed, most of the characters in Wuthering Heights are complex - not all good, not all bad.  This complexity in a novel published in 1847 was far ahead of its time.<br /><br />The setting of the lonely moors of England and the fine country mansions make the story easy to visualize.  The tale is told from the first person point of view of Nelly, the maid who saw it all, and a young boarder who seeks to live with now-older Heathcliff in Heathcliff's dark and imposing estate called Wuthering Heights.<br /><br />The story is epic because it does not stop with Heathcliff and Catherine.  It continues with Heathcliff's son and Catherine's daughter.  The consuming yet doomed love of Heathcliff and Catherine has tragic repercussions for their descendants.  Wuthering Heights is a study of the haunting, eternal power of love.  Emily Bronte's story reminds us that sometimes love is not always beautiful and sweet.  It can also be selfish and twisted.	2005-01-11

Henry Luk, a Hong Kong resident, has written such an amazing action novel in a REAL, not contrived, setting. Luk is intimate with the Hong Kong setting, the contentious politics and history of Hong Kong, Britain, China, and Taiwan, and the Triads, the powerful Hong Kong mafia.<br /><br />China Bride is the story of two star-crossed lovers from two totally different cultures. Beth Connor, a former Olympic runner, is from the Irish working class of Boston. Her fiancee, Michael Chang, is from one of the wealthiest families in Hong Kong. As they journey to Hong Kong to meet his family, they are kidnapped. Beth dives off the side of the boat into the Hong Kong Harbour. Her adventures in Hong Kong unfold so entertainingly. The characters in this book are unforgettable. Why this book has not been optioned for a movie is beyond me.<br /><br />I'll play Beth! Anybody? Anybody?	2005-01-04

Jordan Cray is as good or even a better writer than Stine. I eventually want to collect and read all the danger.com books. The danger.com books are separate novels, not a series, about various teens and their misadventures with the Internet. Written in the late 1990's, when the Internet was just becoming a household name, the danger.com stories recall the time when the Internet was a big, brave new world.<br /><br />Shadow Man is written from the point of view of Annie, a sixteen year-old girl who lives on remote Scull Island off the coast of Connecticut. Scull Island can really be boring, but it is even worse because her boyfriend has just dumped her. To make matters worse, Annie sees the happy new couple everywhere she goes. When Annie's New York City-raised stepbrother Nick comes for Christmas break, he suggests revenge. Annie goes along, but the two soon find that their plan has gone very wrong. A mysterious Shadow Man is after them.<br /><br />This book is written with more sensitivity than most of the genre, with some really good writing and observations about broken hearts, loneliness, and depression.	2005-01-04

The story also takes place on the ship Stargazer, the ship Picard captained before taking the helm of the Enterprise. Oh, in Oblivion Picard is young with a full head of hair.<br /><br />Although this novel features Guinan, none of the other Next Generation Enterprise crew is in this novel. There is, however, a whole new and interesting set of crew members for the reader to get to know. They include a human crew member who is falling in love with a female gaseous being who works in a containment suit.<br /><br />The main story involving Picard and Guinan on Oblivion involves Picard trying to find an old Academy companion with whom Picard is supposed to rendezvous. Denmix has valuable information for the Federation. But at their meeting place, a bomb goes off and the two are fugitives from the Oblivion security forces, and from a pack of ruthless Cardassians hot on their heels. Guinan is a mysterious woman who knows Picard from the past, but he does not know her. Who is this mysterious woman? Who will get to Denmix first: the Cardassians, security, or his friend? What of the other dramas on the ship? This novel is fast paced and furious, with several big twists. A well-written and engaging novel. I recommend it for Next Generation fans.	2004-12-23

This is a fine book and a fine mystery. Max Lucado is a pretty accomplished mystery writer himself. I could not believe all that Lucado has done as described in the author's bio at the end of the book.<br /><br />The story is about a weathly hotelier who has almost surely murdered his mistress/girlfriend. He is slipping through Gil Grissom's fingers. Gil Grissom? Wait a minute, I thought this was CSI Miami. Yes, it is somewhat of a crossover book. There is more than one murder.  Interesting characters include a sexy female Cuban nightclub singer, the wife and stepson of the hotelier, and three aged, retired ex-mobsters from Jersey.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the CSI team characters talk in the same clipped, stilted dialouge as the TV shows. I thought the purpose of a novel was to bring more depth to the characters, to expand their TV profiles.<br /><br />All in all, an excellent read for CSI/Mystery/Crime lovers.	2004-12-22

The novelization of Voyager provides entertainment for grateful Voyager/Star Trek fans.  Section 31 is the second Voyager novel I have read.<br /><br />The story is about Seven and how someone or something is trying to kill her.  As she and Janeway try to get to the bottom of this, the second plot involves a planet-sized, Noah's Ark-type ship full of a race called Rhawns.  The Rhawns are trying to escape the collision of their suns and save their race and their people.  Janeway has to help these people, but trust and science issues get in the way - and time is ticking away.<br /><br />The first three-quarters of the book is immensely intriguing, but the final quarter does not finish all the storylines, or tie them together neatly.  I felt some interesting characters were just cut off.  Nevertheless, this is a worthy effort that is mainly true to the characters and the show.	2004-11-14

Bram Stoker has crafted a timeless masterpiece that will make your blood run cold. Set in the Victorian era, four noble young men, a mysterious monster hunter, and a brave and brilliant young woman join forces against the greatest evil the world has ever known - the king of the vampires, Count Dracula.<br /><br />This book has some of the most enduring characters of literature, including the crazed Dracula disciple Renfield. His scenes in the insane asylum and his dialouge are some of the best in the book. Stoker was also ahead of his time with the character of Mina Harker. Unlike the fainting, male-dependent lass of the time, Mina is iron-willed, resourceful, and highly intelligent. In many parts, she outshines the men in mental capacity, and matches them in physical capacity. For example, during the long journey back to Transylvania, she took turns along with the men driving the horses through the mountains. On that same trip, she is able to hike through the snowy mountains carrying provisions.<br /><br />Some parts of the book are dry and boring, that is to be expected; the book was written in 1897. But the slow parts set the time and tone for the tale. I don't recommend reading it at night. The creepiness seems to set in the dark, quiet air all around you, and you cannot escape.	2004-11-03

The story revolves around single mother Emerald O'Brien, who owns a small tea shop where she gives tarot card readings. Emerald's psychic and clairvoyant gifts cause her trouble as she is drawn into all kinds of scrapes. In Dragon, a destitute man stumbles into her shop for a reading, which Emerald cannot ascertain. The man is struck by a car upon leaving her shop, leaving behind only an exquisite and mysterious tiny dragon carved out of jade.<br /><br />I loved this book and could not put it down. Emerald is a great character all woman can relate too, although I felt all the descriptions of her beauty were a bit much, for example when she says she took the padding out of her bra, because her \\"breasts were big enough and didn't need any help.\\" The two men in her life she struggles to choose from are great supporting characters. Indeed, there are a host of such wonderful supporting characters so that you feel you live in the town of Chiqetaw and can walk down the street for a cup of tea and a sandwich every time you put the book down	2004-11-03

Even better than his debut novel, Wicked, Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister is set in Haarlem, Holland (Netherlands) in the 1630's.  Haarlem is known even today mostly for its flowers and flower related festivals.  In Confessions, the tulip mania and subsequent crash that rocked the Netherlands in the 1630's play a large part.  An even larger role is taken by oil painting.  During this time, referred to as the Golden Age of Holland, Flemish masters vied for commissions of patrons, each one hoping to be recognized as great.  Rembrandt was one such artist.<br /><br />Maguire chose well to set his tale in the Netherlands.  Unlike Wicked, which is set in a fantasy country, the harsh yet captivating winter scenery of Confession's Haarlem includes strange windmills, gray skies, and icy rivers.  Anyone who has ever read the beloved story of Hans Brinker and the Silver Skates will instantly be transported to Holland.<br /><br />The story is told from the P.O.V. of one of \\"Cinderella's\\" ugly stepsisters.  All the familiar characters are here: the widower father, the stepmother, the prince, the other stepsister, and of course, Cinderella.  Her name in the book is Clara.  Iris is an intelligent, kind-hearted, but undeniably ugly girl who befriends her strange stepsister.  Clara is convinced she is a changeling.  Her recounting of her experience will give the reader chills.  Maguire is a master of mingling magic with reality, to produce eerie mystery.  Iris tries to coax her out of her room and to see more of the world.  This leads to more than either of them bargained for.<br /><br />This book is a real treat for any man or woman.  It is for adults, not children.	2004-08-11

Set in Vermont in the 1970's, it is a story of a beautiful hippie midwife who has a patient die in childbirth during a fierce snowstorm. But did her client die from the midwife's error? Told from the P.O.V. of the midwife's young teen daughter, Midwives is thoroughly engrossing. As the picture on the cover of a house in the middle of nowhere, barely visible in the snow-filled night indicates, this is a book to curl up with. The reader alternately squirms during graphic medical sections, is mesmerized during the trial proceedings, and sympathizes with, or hates, the well-portrayed characters.<br /><br />Midwives was written by a man, Chris Bohjalian. I could not believe that such a book, so sensitive to and understanding of women, was not written by a woman. One of Oprah's book club picks.	2004-07-28

Pat Cadigan has a brilliant imagination. She tries her best to keep up with it. Her writing is a bit haphazard, but very good overall. Mindplayers is set in the future, where Mindplay has changed society for better or worse. Differing degrees of Mindplay require professionals to assist those engaging in it. One of these professionals is Deadpan Allie (love that play on words). Allie is a former layabout who has been recruited to become a professional Mindplayer. The strange characters she meets and weird situations she is in mesmerize the reader. There is also a lot of philosophy for the reader to chew on.<br /><br /> Recommended for sci-fi/fantasy fans. No graphic sex or violence.  I also recommend Dervish is Digital, another sci-fi treasure by Cadigan.	2004-07-28

In the 1970's, a fourteen year-old girl is raped and murdered by a neighbor. Susie's murder goes unsolved, her killer goes unpunished, her parents' marriage falls apart. Unbeknownst to those still on Earth, Susie watches everything, hears all from Heaven. I use the term Heaven loosely, because Sebold has no reference to God, Jesus, or angels. There are counselors, and it is a pleasant place except that Susie is helpless to intervene with affairs on Earth. She can only watch.<br /><br />The lives of those she left behind unfold. One of the most interesting characters is Ruana Singh, the mother of Ray Singh, a boy who had a crush on Susie. Ruana adds a much-needed splash of color to the otherwish pallid cast and setting of the book.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is a good story. The reader easily gets wrapped up in it. The curious voyeuristic sensation is a pleasant reading experience. Recommended for ages 14 and up for some disturbing or graphic scenes such as her rape and the dismemberment of her body, marijuana use, and sex between minors.	2004-07-28

Capote writes so descriptively that I had to put the book down periodically because it was so real and so intense.<br /><br />The amount of research Capote did for this was staggering. He left no stone unturned. I loved reading about the time period, which came to life with the recounting. I rented the 1968 movie with (ironically) Robert Blake doing a superb job as Perry Smith, and John Forsythe as Detective Dewey. I wonder what ever happened to all the survivors in this tale.

Maguire deals with many contemporary issues including women's rights, politics, prejudice, and environmental destruction, and the book is highly sexual, so it is not for the faint of heart or for children.

He writes the story of a pretty but lonely young department store clerk with such aptitude, that if I did not see his name on the cover, I would not have believed it would have been written by a man, let alone Steve Martin.<br /><br />The icing on the cake is how Martin writes about L.A.

I liked it and am glad I purchased it new. The problem is that it's almost like Gibson wrote this novel like a session on a psychologist's couch, with every little detail of every person he ever met and everything he ever experienced - without full regard for what the reader would like to hear. There are some details in here I find too graphic and disgusting, such as when he helped a morbidly obese neighbor off a toilet.<br /><br />The book gets a lot better halfway through, and continues to become more moving through the end.  The story of Wesley's roommate John and his eventual death from lung cancer paints a beautiful picture of human frailty and the bonds that exist between us.<br /><br />I am enraptured of New York City and like to read people's accounts of it.

I wish everyone would read this book.<br />The story of Celia, a slave without even a last name, is the story of how impossible justice was for the African-American slaves of the antebellum South.  Despite the valiant efforts of her defense attorneys, Celia's trial was a farce; she never had a chance at a fair trial. The judge had determined her fate before the trial commenced.  Why did the trial take place even though it was predetermined?  The answer lies in the instituition of slavery itself.<br />At the time of Celia's trial in 1885, slavery was tearing the country apart.  In Missouri, where Celia killed her master, pro-slavery forces fierily debated abolitionists over whether or not the Kansas Territory would be settled as a slave or a free state.<br />The individual players in Celia belonged to the culture of slavery as much as Celia herself.  Robert Newsom, Celia's master, was the patriarch of his household.  His two adult daughters possessed more legal rights than slaves: albeit not much more. They depended upon their father for their support and survival.  If the women felt any sympathy for Celia, who had approached them personally for help, it was likely surpassed by fear of being thrown out by their father.<br />Rather than point fingers and shake heads in regret of the travesty of justice to Celia, we should think of the present-day inequities that need our attention and commitment.  Will we have the courage to see the cause through to the bitter end?  Hopefully our efforts will not also be in vain.	2004-07-16

With over 900 pages, it is truly a painstakingly crafted creation worth the time invested to read it.  Women especially will enjoy it and feel empowered, as it goes way back to the old legend of the Goddess and the magic that only women can wield.<br />Marion Zimmer Bradley weaves this tale as colorfully and seamlessly as the ancient medieval tapestries hanging in the dank and chilly castles in the time of King Arthur.  Unlike the traditional telling, however, she also tells the story of the pagan people of the British isles subjected to Christianity and the traditions that carry on - in secret - to this day.  The characters of Arthur, Lancelot, Morgaine, and Guinevere are portrayed from youth to old age.  Many new and old characters are introduced as well.  After you read this book, you will never look at Camelot the same way again.	2004-06-24

One would not think a story about dire alcoholism would be uplifting - but strangely enough, this is.  It is an emotional rollercoaster with lots of laughs, high, and low points.  Despite the serious subject matter, this IS a very funny book.  Augusten Burroughs has left nothing out of this memoir.  After reading it, the reader knows very intimate details about his life:  his relationship with his boyfriends, his co-workers, being sexually abused as a boy.  but most importantly, his relationship with alcohol.<br />Whether you are a teetotaler or a binge-drinking alcoholic, this book will make you laugh, weep, and never look at drinking, love, or life the same way again.	2004-05-23

Itis classified by some as &quot;cyberpunk.&quot;  I don't really know what that genre means, but I recommend Dervish for anyone who enjoys a fast-paced, technology-heavy, mystery story.  Konstantin, the main character, is a woman all women can relate to.  Tough yet sensitive, aware of her flaws, she is human and engaging.<br />The world Cadigan created is mesmerizing.  Nothing is what it seems.  Her imagination is so fertile, her descriptive writing skills so honed, that you squirm with delight at each new incantation.  This book is a puzzle, and not a breeze-through read, but it is immensely intriguing and has a smashing, powerful ending.	2004-05-23

Naoko Takeuchi's artwork is not as crisp as the previous volume.  During the battle scenes it is confusing and difficult to figure out what is happening.  The sound effects are odd and distracting: \\"float\\" (is that a sound?), \\"russle\\" (does she mean rustle?), \\"stickyyy,\\" \\"bro broom,\\" and one of the most puzzling, \\"hurrrl.\\"  These negative comments reflect the second half of the book; the first half is rewarding.<br />In the first half, the mystery of the Golden Crystal and Bunny and Darien's relationship in their previous lives is revealed.  The first half also gives a never-before-seen, in-depth look at the outer senshi's private lives.  (...)	2004-04-08

The book has beautiful art.  Takeuchi's art gets more detailed with each successive volume.  Readers are treated to the breathtaking Helios in his human form, and a glimpse of Artemis' unrequited love for Venus.  The main theme is that a dark, malicious sickness is weakening Darien and tearing him and Bunny apart.<br />SMS vol. 2 is packed with more extras at the end than in previous volumes of the SM series.  Naoko Takeuchi gives us a glimpse of the school lives of Ami, Lita, Raye, and Mina.  These three short stories are a refreshing break from the dark plot of the book.  My hands-down favorite is \\"Lita's Melancholy.\\" I truly felt I was in Lita's world.  I related to her procastination-cleaning tactics, her love of herbal teas and pastries, and her desire to forgo all her responsibilities and stuff her face with Chinese scones and brownies (I have never heard of a Chinese scone, though.  Scones are British, as far as I know)!(...)	2004-04-07
