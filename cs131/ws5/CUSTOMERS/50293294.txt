Basically everything was explained over again in this novel.  I understand that they had to explain to the Zelandonii & the members of their cave, but Ms. Auel should know that WE KNOW what happened.  Why make us read the same events over and over again?  Why couldn't she just said \\"Ayla explained about how she discovered the firestones\\" that would have made me feel better.  I read somewhere that this book is a buildup for the next book, that makes sense with the introduction of ALL the members of this cave, to explain each status & how they feel about Ayla individually, But Still....<br />This book is overly repititious in every way.  How many times do we have to hear about her unusual accent? YES WE KNOW!!<br />How many times about the firestones?  YES WE KNOW!!<br />How many times about her animals? YES WE KNOW!!<br />Although I found about the whole novel completely annoying, I did enjoy the Summer meeting & when Ayla does deliever her child.  That, for me was thrilling.  I've read each novel, and I'm so glad that she finally is having a child.<br />I think this is actually a good book for people who have never read the other books.  It would make more sense.  It almost covers EVERYTHING in every book.<br />I was lucky enough to read the previous novels about a year and a half before this one was released.  I feel sorry for the people have waited and waited for 12 years for this book they could've written theirselves.<br />I will read the next novel when it comes out.  I PRAY that it will be less repitious.  I'm curious to know what happens to Brukevel, the man who is half-flathead (clan) who needs mass-therapy.	2003-12-18

There are some surprisingly good sections in this story, between alot of sex and scenery.<br />My favorite part of the book is when \\"The Wolf Pack\\" comes in.  It kind of reminded me more of like \\"The Amazons\\" in medevil times.  Attaroa was the most twisted person mentioned in any of the Earth Children's series.  She has much, depth, pain and craziness in her.  She is one of the more interesting characters in this series.<br />The Novel has some other good parts as well, but I think that over all this book is just a \\"Good\\" novel.  It was just about everything that I thought it would be.  I can understand why some people were upset that it took Jean M. Auel a long time to write her next addition to this series.  This one leaves you with a cliffhanger.	2002-02-16

Either you loved the book, or you hated it.  I, personally don't hate or love it.  I think it was an exceptionally good book, and It could've been a bit more scarier.  I kept thinking of those little goblins from the movie \\"The Gate\\" the whole time I was reading the book.  I am not an avid Dean R. Koontz's fan (at least not yet) the only other book i've read was \\"The Servents Of Twilight\\" and I think that one is pretty amazing as well.<br />The book is filled with voodoo and the power of good and evil.  The Detective Jack is trying to protect his children from a certain \\"Prince Of Darkness\\" who is trying to get to them through these little goblins.  The book is suspenseful, and is very fast paced.  There was some character build but not by much.  In the book, it was only about a day that this story took place, so within it's self, was very quick.<br />Bottom line, i think you should read this book, it's cool, has cool characters in it, and a pretty good story line :)	2002-01-20

It was nothing like I thought it would've been.  The storyline is very dull, I didn't make much sense out of it, and I thought about throwing it in the dumpster!  I am really glad I did not buy this book, luckily i borrowed it from a friend!<br />You can't imagine how disappointed I was with this book! I thought it would be the coolest thing to find out about Thee Wicked Witch of the West!  But it was boring, and I thought most of it didn't revolve around her anyway.  The book could've been made so much better.... why wasn't it?	2002-01-20

It took me close to two months to get past the first 200 pages, I did not want to read it, I was sooooooo bored with it!! But I wanted to finish the series so I forced myself into finishing it.  Luckily, I didn't have to force myself too much, around the 300 pages into the novel, I got into it!<br />I Do agree that the novel was like a prehistoric Soap opera with the love triangle between Ayla, Jondolar and Ranec, and I didn't feel that Jondalar had to be so jealous most of the time, and it took them 300 pages to resolve it.  I would've rather had Ayla ditched both of them and went with the Character from the wolf pack, who i cannot remember his name at the moment, but of course, with the formula of the novel, you know who ends up with her.<br />Character development was wonderful.  I did find it hard to remember all of the characters, though! I kept forgetting who was male and female! lol.<br />My favorite part was when Ayla stood up to the people about Rydag, that gave me much joy to see how much the Lion Camp cared for her.<br />But all in all, If you want to read the whole series, you should read this one as well.  I personally thought the book was a tad bit too long, to not really cover much.  But you can still skip this novel and continue on with &quot;Plains Of Passage&quot;	2002-01-09

Ayla, the lead character in the book, has been cursed with death and is forced to leave the only people she has ever known.  Her journey takes her to the Valley of Horses, where Ayla chooses to live.  Along the way, she befriends a Horse and Cave Lion Cub.<br />Unlike &quot;Clan Of The Cave Bear&quot; this book was not as intriguing as its original.  Certain parts of the novel, I felt could have been cut out, i.e. I thought the whole story of Jondalar and his brother Thonolan could've been cut out.  I know it was put there for us to be introduced to Jondalar, but their story was not that interesting.  I would have perferred that they kept them out of the story until Ayla meets them.  It would've kept the novel at a steady pace rather than cutting back to Ayla and then cutting back to Jondolar. I think it would have made Jondolar more intriguing, if he were more of a mystery.<br />What excited me about &quot;COTCB&quot; was the Cave People themselves, were unlike anything like us, as to where in this book the Zolandiis and Mamutoi are more of who we are today, which I find unbelievable.<br />But overall, I am very happy with this book, and Am very happy for Ayla in this book!  There is a certain flare to this book which is compelling.  I definetly have grown attached to Whinney and Baby!  I do recommend this book to anyone who is interested, and I will continue on with &quot;The Mammoth Hunters&quot;....	2001-11-17

I've had this novel for the past year or so, But I could never get into it, so it sat there for months and months.  I was going through my books recently, and came across it, so I thought I'd attempt to read it again.  I must say that this novel is fascinating!! The novel is about a little girl who is separated from her Clan and is taken into another Clan who finds her barely alive.  The novel, I think, is about coming of age, and acceptence of ones self and of others.  I think it's about growth and basically life.  Ayla who is the main character in this novel, goes through many things.  She had her ups and downs with the clan of the cave bear, and it gave her an identity and independence that no one in that clan had ever had: least of all women.  However, this novel is brilliant, and it made me cry at the end.  I cannot wait to continue the series, and I will definetly write a review for the second, third, and fourth!!!	2001-10-24

I think that this novel is very romantic, very decietful and very joyful.  Just like any V. C. Andrews books, they all seem to contain all of the above, which In my opinion is an amazing gift.  In this book, Heaven is growing into a mature young woman, trying to forget a past that had betrayed her, and looking into the future with her eyes wide open.  This is a great novel, and one of her more successful ones at that.	2001-08-15

A word to the wise, save your 26.95 dollars on this book, if you're interested buy the cheap paperback cover.  This book is soooo vague, I couldn't believe it! I was so disappointed.  Vittorio didn't even change into a vampire until like the last 50 pages!  This novel reaked!

It had such distasteful, unforgettable stories in it, how can one not be intrigued?!  My favorite stories were of &quot;The Tale Of The Nymphomaniac&quot; which is not the real title.  A story about a girl who just can't seem to... get enough! :)  I think my favorite story out of the whole series of collection would be &quot;Grub Girl&quot;.  Its a futuristic story of a prostitute.  I can't really give away much.  Some of the stories are not erotic, and some aren't horror.  But most have an even balance.

I love the characters Christine is a very strong character, she is to be much admired.  Joey is a typical little boy, but you really wonder, could he be evil?  And Detective Harrison is a good hero, he always seems to get Christine and Joey from point A to point B.  I found the book very scary, not supernatural wise. But knowing what they felt like, being hunted.  I couldn't put the novel down I read it within 3 days.  I also watched the movie, which I do not recommend. This is also the first Dean R.

Well anyway, this novel is wonderful!  I found it difficult the first 100 pages, but then again It seems like I always have this problem!  The narrator of this story is, of course, the wonderful David Talbot (Body Theif) and of his encounters and his life with the lovely Mayfair, Merrick.  He is telling Louis this story of what had happened in her life.  Louis is, of course, very interested because Merrick has the ability to talk to the dead, and of course, he would give anything to speak with Claudia again...<br />The novel is well written in the ways of Anne Rice.

However, towards the middle of the end, really bored me! This is the third novel I read by Anne Rice, and I do love the movie better as well... But you miss alot that's in the story than the movie, so I recommend reading the book and then watching the movie...	2000-03-08

I've seen the movie, before I read the book and I love the book a million times more than the movie.  You really get into the life of Carlotta (Carla in the movie).  You get flashbacks of her life from when she was a child, to her first and second marriage.  And the ending IS different.  This book scared me constantly while reading it, it kind of freaks me out to hear that it's based on a true story.  All in all, if you find a copy of it, BUY IT... it's now out of print, and worth your time for reading..	2000-03-02

It's about 3  generations of women, who go through the good times and bad times, too...  and really come together in the end.  I loved it!	2000-03-01

It's about a girl who comes  back to her childhood town to teach and here she is about to unleash alot  of the memories that she has blocked out.

It was great... It's about this family who are basically hillbillies, who are poor, and the story revolves around the daughter Heaven, who promises she'll find her dead mother's parents, and make a life she can be proud of... such tragedy ahead, tears, &amp; Abuse... It's a wonderfully written story... I recommend it, definetly...	2000-02-25

It is truly a great novel... and I even liked the 1930's film... and even liked the song... funny!<br />It's really a piece of art.. It kind of  reminds me of a VC Andrews about rage &amp; revenge.. Probably the  &quot;Flowers In The Attic&quot; series... It's truly a great novel, and a  heartbreaking one of that... and I had some problem understanding some of  the words that I didn't understand... I had to look them up in a  dictionary...	2000-02-19
